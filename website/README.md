# Michigan Child Welfare Licensing Dashboard

A lightweight web dashboard built with Vite to display Michigan Child Welfare agency documents and reports.  Live [here](https://scintillating-licorice-0dd1c4.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **Agency Directory**: Browse all child welfare agencies
- **Document Tracking**: View detailed document reports for each agency
- **Search & Filter**: Search agencies by name or ID
- **Expandable Details**: Click any agency to view detailed documents
- **Summary Statistics**: Dashboard showing total agencies and reports

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- Python 3.11+
- pandas and pyarrow Python packages

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Generate the data files:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal)

### Building for Production

Run the build script which:
1. Installs Python dependencies from pyproject.toml
2. Generates JSON data files from CSVs (document info, SIR summaries, violation levels)
3. Applies keyword reduction to consolidate violation keywords
4. Exports parquet documents to individual JSON files
5. Builds the static website with Vite

```bash
./build.sh
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Netlify Deployment

The site is configured for automatic deployment on Netlify. The build process:

1. Installs Python dependencies with pip
2. Runs `generate_website_data.py` to create JSON files from CSVs
3. Runs `export_parquet_to_json.py` to export parquet documents to individual JSON files
4. Applies keyword reduction using `violation_curation_keyword_reduction.csv`
5. Builds the static site with Vite

### Keyword Reduction

The build process applies keyword reduction to consolidate similar violation keywords for better consistency. For example:
- "inadequate supervision" and "lack of supervision" → "supervision failure"
- "unsafe de-escalation" → "de-escalation failure"
- "paperwork delay" → "paperwork error"

This is configured through `pdf_parsing/violation_curation_keyword_reduction.csv` and is automatically applied during the build. The original data in `sir_violation_levels.csv` remains unchanged.

### Netlify Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file configures:
- Build command: `bash build.sh`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Python version: 3.11
- SPA routing with redirects

## Data Sources

The dashboard uses data from:

- **Document Info CSV**: `../pdf_parsing/document_info.csv` - structured metadata about documents
- **SIR Summaries CSV**: `../pdf_parsing/sir_summaries.csv` - AI-generated summaries for Special Investigation Reports
- **SIR Violation Levels CSV**: `../pdf_parsing/sir_violation_levels.csv` - severity levels and keywords for SIRs
- **Keyword Reduction CSV**: `../pdf_parsing/violation_curation_keyword_reduction.csv` - maps keywords to consolidated versions
- **Parquet Files**: `../pdf_parsing/parquet_files/` - source PDF text extracts exported to individual document JSON files

The dashboard derives all agency information directly from the document data (no separate facility metadata required).
