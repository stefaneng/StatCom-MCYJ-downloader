The only incident witnessed was the youth\nassaulting staff.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 06/23/2025 an in-person interview was completed with Chief\nAdministrator (CA) and Director of Residential Services (DRC)\nat Christ Child House (CCH). They were advised of the Special\nInvestigation and provided the allegations. CA and DRC were\naware of the incident and both denied knowledge that Staff 1 or\nStaff 2 were physically aggressive with Youth A. A request was\nmade for video footage and incident reports.\nOn 06/26/2025 an in-person interview was held with\nComplainant. No additional concerns were noted.\nIn-person interviews were completed with the following at\nCCH on 6/26/2025, unless otherwise noted.\nYouth A was interviewed and asked to tell me about what\noccurred between him and Staff 1 and Staff 2. He reported he was\nup front trying to get into the agency and he was banging on the\nwindows and doors when Staff 1 grabbed his wrist in an attempt to\nget him to stop. Youth A reported he pulled away and ran to the\nback of the agency to the Motor City room. He reported he\npushed the Plexi glass out and entered the room through the\nwindow. Youth A reported he was hot and tired of being outside.\nHe then stated he was back at the entrance of the building and\nboth Staff 1 and Staff 2 both grabbed his arm, but stated it was a\n“fundamental restraint”. Youth A recalled that law enforcement\nwas eventually called and he went to the hospital for an\nevaluation. Youth A denied that other youth or staff were present.\nHe denied having other instances of physical assault by Staff 1 or\nStaff 2. Youth A was asked if he recalls Supervisor 1, Staff 3 or\nClinical Case Manager being present or coming outside and he\nreported no. I asked Youth A if he recalled standing in front of or\nnear the agency vehicle or being upset because he was unable to\ngo on an outing and he responded no. Youth A continued to\nattempt to redirect the interview to other topics and eventually was\n2",

She reported\nshe went outside for a break and saw Staff 1 and Staff 2 outside\nwith Youth A.
