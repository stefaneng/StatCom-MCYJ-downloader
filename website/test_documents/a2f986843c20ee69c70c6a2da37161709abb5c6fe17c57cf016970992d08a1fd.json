    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation While placed at the facility Youth A experienced physical abuse\nfrom staff and other youth.\nInvestigation The complainant was interviewed over the phone on 04/10/2023\nand had no additional information to report. She stated Youth A’s\nparent likely had more information and provided contact\ninformation for her.\nYouth A’s parent was interviewed over the phone on 04/10/2023.\nDuring this interview Youth A’s parent reported several concerns\nand allegations against the facility regarding her daughter’s time\nplaced there. She specifically recalled concerns regarding an\nincident that she believed occurred in October involving her\ndaughter and a staff member that allowed her daughter to get beat\nup by other youth. She believed the staff at fault in that incident\nwas Supervisor 1. Youth A’s parent stated her daughter brought\nup this incident to her for the first time the day prior. Youth A’s\nparent stated she had called local law enforcement and Youth A\nwas interviewed regarding this incident at her new placement.\nYouth A was interviewed on 04/12/2023 during an announced,\nface to face visit at her new placement. This interview occurred in\nthe presence of a staff member from the placement and Youth A’s\nparent at Youth A’s request. When asked about the incident in\nquestion, Youth A stated Supervisor 1 had put her hands on Youth\nA’s chest in an attempt to move her during an altercation, and it\nfelt like she was shoved. Youth A recalled Supervisor 1 denied\npushing her in that movement, but that was not how Youth A\ninterpreted that part of the interaction. Youth A recalled being\npushed by either a staff or youth, she could not clarify who, and\nfalling to the floor. She clarified at no point did any staff attempt to\nrestrain her while she was fighting with other youth, but only that\nSupervisor 1 pushed her. She recalled Youth D choking her from\nbehind as well but could not be specific as to how this part of the\nincident ended. Youth A also remembered Youth C and Youth E\npulled hair out of her head during the fighting. Youth A stated she\nfelt like the entire incident lasted for about 30 minutes. Youth A\nstated she had not felt like talking more about the incident to her\nparent or anyone else because she was scared that it could have\nbeen used against her. When asked to elaborate as to why she\nmay have had that fear, Youth A could not provide any specific\nreasons. After the altercation Youth A stated she felt lumps on the\nback of her head and that her back was hurting. Youth A clarified\nshe felt like she was never held down during the incident.\n3",
    "Supervisor 1 was interviewed on 04/21/2023 with DHHS Worker\n1 and Law Enforcement during an announced, face to face visit to\nthe facility. She stated she remembered the incident in question\nand confirmed that she was involved in it. Supervisor 1 stated the\nentire fight began when there was discord between Youth A and\nYouth D, with Youth A eventually attempting to fight Youth D.\nSupervisor 1 stated she was standing in between Youth A and\nYouth D when this occurred and denied putting her hands on\neither youth at that time. Supervisor 1 stated Youth A was able to\nget around her and to Youth D to start fighting. She stated she\nwas able to talk Youth A into stopping the fight and moving to her\nown personal aisle by her bed, which Youth A did without any\nincident and without Supervisor 1 having to put her hands on her.\nSupervisor 1 recalled Youth E then began to escalate and argue\nwith Youth A. Supervisor 1 stated other staff became involved at\nthat point but could not immediately recall who they were. Youth\nE then swung over the back of Supervisor 1 and attempted to hit\nYouth A, from what Supervisor 1 recalled. She believed Youth A\nwas hit on the top of her head by Youth E. Supervisor 1 stated\nshe separated the two youth by physically moving Youth A. When\nasked to be more specific on how this occurred, Supervisor 1\ndescribed her actions as placing her hands on the outside of\nYouth A’s shoulders while facing her. Supervisor 1 stated she\nthen moved Youth A away from the other youth and Youth A\ncomplied and walked with her. At no point during this part of their\ninteraction did Youth A attempt to get away from Supervisor 1, nor\ndid she fall to the ground according to Supervisor 1. At this point\nSupervisor 1 recalled Youth C and Youth E again attempting to hit\nYouth A. She described seeing Youth C run from around the right\nside of Supervisor 1 to grab Youth A’s hair, causing Youth A to fall\nto the floor. At the same time Supervisor 1 remembered seeing\nYouth C go around her left side and attempt to hit Youth A while\nYouth A fell to the ground. Supervisor 1’s interview had to end at\nthat time and was resumed on 04/26/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nand Law Enforcement during an announced, face to face visit to\nthe facility. During this interview, Supervisor 1 clarified how she\nhad put her hands on Youth A the one time she recalled this\noccurring during the incident in question. She demonstrated\nputting each hand on the top and side of Youth A’s shoulders and\nwalking Youth A backwards. Supervisor 1 reiterated that there\nwas no pushing involved in this interaction and Youth A moved\nwith her cooperatively. Supervisor 1 stated she believed this\nphysical contact was necessary because of the fast escalation of\nfighting between Youth A and the other youth involved.\n4",
    "Staff 1 was interviewed on 04/21/2023 with DHHS Worker 1 and\nLaw Enforcement during an announced, face to face visit to the\nfacility. Staff 1 initially struggled to recall the incident in question\ninvolving Youth A but stated she did remember after recalling\nYouth D throwing juice at Youth A. She stated that began a fight\ninvolving several other youths. Staff 1 recalled that Youth A and\nYouth D were throwing punches at each other quickly, and that\nYouth C and Youth E were also involved in attempting to punch\nYouth A during the incident. Staff 1 stated she believed the\naggressor in all this was Youth A. She did not recall seeing Youth\nA be pushed by any other youth or staff during the incident. Staff\n1 could not remember what other staff were involved in the\nincident other than Supervisor 1. She recalled seeing Supervisor\n1 attempt to de-escalate the situation by standing in between\nYouth A and Youth D. Staff 1 clarified she did not see Supervisor\n1 put her hands on Youth A or Youth D during that part of the\nincident, or the rest of the incident until it deescalated.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 05/09/2023 with DHHS Worker 1 and\nLaw Enforcement during an announced, face to face visit to the\nfacility. She stated she recalled the incident in question. Staff 2\nstated Youth A and Youth D began fighting with each other. In her\nopinion Youth A was the aggressor but Youth C, Youth D and\nYouth E all started to fight back against her. Staff 2 recalled\nseeing Supervisor 1 attempt to stand in between Youth A and\nYouth D and telling Youth A something to the effect of “It’s not\nworth it” as she attempted to de-escalate the youth. Staff 2 stated\nshe and Supervisor 1 both attempted to separate Youth C and\nYouth A after Youth C attempted to punch Youth A. Staff 2\ndescribed this separation attempt as only verbal and not having\nany physical contact with either youth. Staff 2 recalled seeing\nYouth A standing all the way up to that part of the incident, and\nnot on the ground from falling. Staff 2 stated she could not recall\nexactly how the fight ended, but she remembered seeing Youth A\nsitting on the ground after everyone was deescalated debriefing\nthe incident with another staff member, who she could not recall.\nStaff 2 stated she did not see anyone get bit during the incident.\nShe also could not recall seeing anyone being kicked, or having\ntheir hair pulled. Staff 2 stated she believed Youth A was never\npushed to the ground during the incident itself but sat down\nafterwards on her own. Staff 2 believed the entire incident lasted\nroughly eight minutes. She stated she did not see any staff push\nor hit Youth A or any other youth during the incident.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone on 05/09/2023 with DHHS\nWorker 1. She stated she could remember the incident because\n5",
    "of how it began, with Youth A and Youth D and juice boxes being\nthrown. Staff 3 recalled seeing Supervisor 1 attempt to de-\nescalate the situation as it evolved, specifically speaking with\nYouth A. Staff 3 stated the situation escalated very quickly after\nthat, with Youth C attempting to hit Youth A and Youth A trying to\nfight back. Staff 3 stated she recalled seeing Staff 1 attempt to\nblock Youth A from getting to Youth D, but doing so without having\nphysical contact with Youth A. Staff 3 stated she never heard any\nof the other staff instruct any of the youth to fight, nor did she\nbelieve any of the staff involved failed to act quickly enough to\nattempt to de-escalate the situation. Staff 3 also stated no other\nstaff members pushed any youth despite the chaotic situation, and\nneither did she. Staff 3 stated she never saw Youth A fall to the\nfloor during the incident. She stated it was possible that Youth D\nmay have been able to have Youth A by the hair during the\nincident and she could not be sure if that did or did not occur.\nYouth B was interviewed over the phone with Law Enforcement\nand DHHS Worker 2 on 05/10/2023. She confirmed she had\npreviously been placed at the facility with Youth A and she\nremembered that Youth A had gotten into a lot of physical\naltercations, so she had initial trouble recalling which one she was\nbeing asked about. Youth B stated she did remember the incident\nin question and called this one “the worst” of them all. Youth B\nstated at one point in the fight, Youth A had three girls on her\nattempting to hit her. She identified these youth as Youth C,\nYouth E and could not identify the third youth. Youth B stated the\nwhole incident began because Youth A and Youth D had gotten in\nto a verbal altercation. Youth A took a juice box and, while a staff\nwas attempting to verbally de-escalate and stand between the two\nyouth, Youth A squirted the juice box in the face of Youth D.\nYouth B couldn't remember which staff that was specifically, but\nshe did remember Supervisor 1 being involved in much of the\naltercation. Youth B stated she could only recall Supervisor 1\nattempting to verbally redirect any of the youth involved. Youth B\ndidn’t believe any staff were physical or put their hands on Youth\nA during the altercation. She recalled seeing Youth C, Youth D,\nand Youth E hitting Youth A at various points during the incident\nbut never as a result of staff not attempting to intervene or doing\nso not quickly enough.\nYouth C was interviewed over the phone with Law Enforcement\nand DHHS Worker 3 on 05/10/2023. Youth C stated she was in\nthe unit and recalled the incident in question. She recalled the\nentire incident began because Youth A had stated to Youth E that\nshe had a crush on another youth in the program, and Youth D\n6",
    "and Youth E told staff about this information. This upset Youth A,\nfrom what Youth C could recall. As the situation escalated, Youth\nC recalled Supervisor 1, Staff 1 and Staff 2 present. Youth C\nbelieved all the staff that interacted initially with Youth A had\nstayed hands off with her, but she was trying to jump around them\nto get to Youth D with which she was upset. Youth C believed\nYouth A fell to the ground while attempting to get around\nSupervisor 1, and then got back up and attempted to hit\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 1. At that point Youth C believed Youth D\nwas able to get behind Youth A and choke her around her neck.\nYouth C stated she could not remember many specifics after that\nother than seeing a couple of other youth that she could not\nidentify attempting to hit Youth A. She did not recall if anyone\npulled Youth A’s hair. Youth C stated she did not see any staff\ninvolved hit Youth A during the altercation and stated that they\nmostly remained hands off.\nYouth D was interviewed over the phone with Law Enforcement\nand DHHS Worker 4 on 05/11/2023. She stated she did not really\nremember much of the incident in question. She did recall how it\nbegan, stating Youth A was upset at her and threw juice in her\nface around one of the staff members involved, although she\ncould not recall which staff member. Youth D stated she knew for\nsure that staff did not put their hands on Youth A during the\naltercation. She believed they were trying to talk to her to de-\nescalate her and Youth D stated she did not see Youth A be\nrestrained in any form. Youth D remembered fighting with Youth\nA at some point during the altercation but could not state which\nstaff broke that up or exactly how that was accomplished. Youth\nD reiterated that all that she could really recall was that staff were\ntrying to break up the fight and were instructing all the youth\ninvolved to go to their personal aisles next to their beds.\nYouth E was interviewed over the phone with Law Enforcement\nand DHHS Worker 3 on 05/11/2023. Youth E stated she was\ninvolved in the altercation in question. Youth E stated she\nbelieved Supervisor 1 was the only staff in the unit when other\nyouth began to get upset and she called for Staff 1 to come in to\nassist. Youth E believed that Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 both\ngrabbed each of Youth A’s arms while facing behind her in an\nattempt to perform a standing restraint after she was escalated,\nbut Youth A broke away. Youth E stated she did not see any\nslamming or shoving from staff towards any youth during the\nwhole altercation. Youth E recalled Youth A threw punches at\nSupervisor 1, although she was not sure if any connected. Youth\nE stated Supervisor 1 did not fight back. Youth E also recalled\n7",
    "seeing Youth A throwing a chair. At some point during the\naltercation, Youth E stated she was involved and that she was on\ntop of Youth A and attempted to hit her. Youth E believed\nSupervisor 1 grabbed her by the shoulders from behind to pull\nYouth E off of Youth A. Youth E stated she then moved. Youth E\nremembered Youth D attempted to fight Youth A only to be\nrestrained by Staff 1. Youth E could not elaborate on how that\nrestraint occurred, only that Staff 1 was able to get Youth D to\nstop attempting to hit Youth A. Youth E recalled Supervisor 1 was\nthe “main” staff involved and was doing a lot to try to break up the\nfighting. Youth E noted Supervisor 1 did not restrain Youth A\nwhen Youth A was attempting to hit her, and that surprised Youth\nE. Youth E remembered Supervisor 1 stating something to the\neffect of “I’m not about to hit no kid”. Youth E stated she never\nsaw anyone pulling Youth A’s hair, nor did she see any staff not\nattempting to intervene in any of the fighting as they should have.\nYouth F was interviewed over video conference with DHHS\nWorker 1 on 05/12/2023. She recalled being in the unit as many\nof the other youth involved in the incident. Youth F recalled\nseeing two other youth fighting with Youth A, and believed it was\nYouth C and Youth E. Youth F described this as Youth C and\nYouth E “jumping” Youth A. When asked to clarify what\ninvolvement staff had in the interaction, Youth F stated she could\nnot remember all the staff involved but did recall Supervisor 1 and\nStaff 1 being present and attempting to de-escalate the situation.\nYouth F recalled the beginning of the whole incident was Youth A\nthrowing juice in the face of Youth D. Youth F recalled Supervisor\n1 holding her arms out to her sides and attempting to block Youth\nA from getting at other youth to fight but stated Supervisor 1 did\nnot put her hands on Youth A during that part of the interaction.\nYouth F believed all staff involved attempted to break up any\nfighting in an appropriate and quick manner but could not\nelaborate on any specifics. Youth F stated she could see the\nwhole interaction from where she was sitting on her bed and noted\nSupervisor 1 never pushed or hit any of the youth involved. Youth\nF stated she could not really recall how the incident ended.\nCommunication with Law Enforcement occurred on 05/15/2023\nthat confirmed they intended to complete the writing of their report\nand request that the matter be closed out as opposed to filing any\ncharges against any of the staff or youth involved in the incident.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Police report from the Dearborn Police Department dated\n04/09/2023. Law enforcement responded to Youth A’s new\n8",
    "placement at the request of Youth A’s parent in order to\ntake a report. In this report Youth A described the incident\nin question as occurring sometime in October or November\n2022. Youth A stated she was beaten up and that she had\nlumps on her head as a result. She stated she was\n“jumped on” by five people including Youth C, Youth D,\nYouth E and Youth G as well as Supervisor 1. She alleged\nSupervisor 1 pushed her to the floor and the other youth hit\nher in the head. Youth A also stated other staff were\npresent at the time and did not attempt to intervene.\n• Incident Report dated 10/06/2022. In this incident report a\nconsistent course of events is described as what was\ngathered from staff and youth interviews, including that the\nincident began with Youth A spraying juice at another\nyouth, who was unnamed in the report. This report stated\nSupervisor 1 attempted to provide proximity between Youth\nA and her peer as Youth A verbally escalated. When\nSupervisor 1 moved Youth A to her personal aisle, Youth A\nbegan to attempt to hit staff further. Two of Youth A’s\npeers then came over and attempted to fight her. As staff\nwere able to separate all the youth they then returned to\nbaseline.\n• Safety plans for Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 were authored on\n04/12/2023 pending the results of this investigation. They\nstated that each staff were not to work alone with any\nyouth.\n• Discipline records for Supervisor 1 were reviewed.

    "Violation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A was not provided medical attention after the incident in\nquestion.\nInvestigation Youth A’s parent was interviewed over the phone on 04/10/2023.\nDuring this conversation she alleged that Youth A suffered injuries\nat the time of the incident in question. Youth A’s parent stated\nthat she knew this from phone communication with Youth A after\nthe incident. Youth A’s parent could not give a consistent answer\non what injuries her daughter may have suffered.\nDuring an announced, face to face visit at her new placement\nYouth A was interviewed on 04/12/2023. Youth A stated that she\nthought that the injuries she suffered during the incident included\na bump on the back of her head, hair pulled from her head and\ncuts on her eyebrows. Youth A stated she never saw any medical\nprofessionals after the incident, whether it be inside the facility or\nat an urgent care facility. Youth A could not state specifically that\nshe had asked to seek medical attention after this incident, nor\ncould she state if she told anyone at the facility about these\ninjuries.\nSupervisor 1, Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3 were all interviewed\nseparately and gave consistent accounts of possible injuries and\nstatements heard from Youth A after the incident in question. All\nfour staff recalled either hearing Youth A deny having any medical\ntreatment or feeling like she was injured after the incident, or not\nhearing her state she wanted to seek medical treatment.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Nurse’s Note from the facility dated 10/06/2023 at 12:20\npm.

Youth A’s parent explained that Youth A had been\nprescribed Lithium at the time of placement. She stated that she\nheard from Youth A towards the end of the placement that she\nhad stopped being provided this medication, but could not provide\nan exact date for when this occurred. Youth A’s parent stated that\nshe never gave consent for this change and initially stated that\nshe never talked to any staff at the facility about this change.\nDuring the interview Youth A’s parent stated that she had\nparticipated in conversations and meetings where this topic had\nbeen discussed. Youth A’s parent stated she had been told by\nfacility staff that Youth A’s medication had changed and her\ndosages had been adjusted lower because there had been some\nconcern over some heart issues that had been discovered. Youth\nA’s parent stated she believed some self-harm attempts that\nYouth A exhibited in the months following were attributed to this\nmedication change. She provided documentation that she had\nreceived from the facility which is outlined below.\nDuring an announced, face to face visit at her new placement\nYouth A was interviewed on 04/12/2023. In this interview Youth\nA reported she had stopped taking her Lithium medication while in\nplacement, and that affected her mood as she had increased\nmood swings and was more easily frustrated. Youth A stated she\ndidn’t feel like harming herself because of the medication change,\nbut more so because of her lack of progress in programming and\nthe fighting incident in question for this investigation.\nDuring an unannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on\n06/13/2023 Therapist 1 was interviewed. Therapist 1 provided\nconsistent information and recollection of the course of Youth A’s\nmedications in that there had been concern discovered over Youth\nA’s heart and that medical professionals had recommended that\nYouth A discontinue the use of Lithium for a period of time while\nthat could be evaluated. Therapist 1 stated that she had taken\n11",
    "part in ensuring that Youth A’s medications were properly handled\nas a result when the concern was first discovered, but also that\nshe was not the prescribing psychiatrist for the medication and did\nnot make decisions after that point in time.\nPsychiatrist 1 was interviewed over the phone on 06/27/2023.\nShe confirmed that she was the prescribing psychiatrist for Youth\nA during her time placed at the facility. Psychiatrist 1 confirmed\nthat Youth A had been taking Lithium as prescribed until an\nabnormal EKG had been discovered and it was recommended to\nher by outside medical professionals that she stop taking that\nmedication temporarily. Psychiatrist 1 stated that she had\nreviewed Youth A’s progress in the program, spoken with\napplicable staff and both Youth A and Youth A’s parent on several\noccasions during the time that Youth A was off of that medication\nand concluded that Youth A was doing well and not showing signs\nthat would prompt the re-prescribing of Lithium. She specifically\nrecalled a meeting where Youth A’s parent was participating\nvirtually and had verbally agreed to not re-prescribing Lithium but\ndid not follow through with this in writing later. Psychiatrist 1\nexplained that the Lithium’s discontinuation did not require\nparental consent but that the facility attempted to communicate\nwell with Youth A and her parent because the initial intention was\nthat it would be re-prescribed after the heart condition concerns\nwere resolved, and that would have required a consent if not for\nthe positive developments shown in Youth A while off the\nmedication. She also noted that there were medications that\nPsychiatrist 1 had recommended for Youth A, including switching\nfrom Klonopin to Vistaril that she felt would be in Youth A’s best\ninterest, but these changes did not occur because they were not\nable to get written consent from Youth A’s parent. She believed\nthat none of these changes were able to take affect before Youth\nA’s eventual graduation from the program on 04/04/2023.\nPsychiatrist 1 provided clinical notes that are described below.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Email communication was received dated 03/14/2023 with\nthe facility’s nursing staff regarding Youth A’s prescribed\npsychotropic medication. In this communication it was\nstated that Youth A’s dosage for Lithium was decreased as\nthere was concern regarding possible heart concerns\ndiscovered during a regularly scheduled well child exam.\n• Youth A’s parent provided a copy of State of Michigan\npaperwork (DHS-1643) intended to capture psychotropic\nmedication consent from parents and legal guardians of\nyouth in the foster care system. This form had illegible\n12",
    "handwriting over much of it from Youth A’s parent. In\naddition, this form is not applicable to Youth A’s case as\nher case was not managed through the abuse/neglect\nsystem, but through the juvenile justice system from her\nlocal county and delinquency case management provided\nby a contracted agency with the local county.\n• Updated Court Report authored by Youth A’s probation\nofficer regarding Youth A’s placement change after leaving\nthe facility. In this report it is documented by Youth A’s\nprobation officer that she was last seen by the contracted\npsychiatrist for the facility on 03/23/2023. At that time she\nwas taking Lithium as one of her documented prescribed\nmedications.\n• Psychiatric Evaluation Update and Medication Review\nspanning the entire placement for Youth A were received\nand reviewed.\n• In the 10/06/2022, 11/17/2022 and 11/21/2022\ndocuments it is noted by Psychiatrist 1 that there\nwas interest in switching one of Youth A’s\npsychotropic medications for another but that did not\noccur because there had not yet been a signed\nconsent received from Youth A’s parent.\n• The 01/31/2023 documentation stated that Youth A’s\nparent had verbally confirmed that she would\nconsent to medication changes discussed at a\nmeeting held virtually that day.\n• The 02/14/2023 documentation stated that consent\nwas still pending return from Youth A’s parent and it\nis noted that the new medication had not been\nprescribed at that time. Psychiatrist 1 also\ndiscussed the abnormal EKG results with Youth A\nand recommended a cardiology consultation as soon\nas possible for the EKG abnormalities.\n• The 02/16/2023 documentation stated that EKG test\nresults had been received and that the Psychiatrist\nagreed with the direction received that Lithium was\nto be held until further cardiology evaluations were to\nbe completed, and describes the cardiotoxicity that\ncould occur with the continued use of Lithium at that\ntime.\n• In the 02/21/2023 documentation Youth A expressed\nto Psychiatrist 1 that she had not felt any significant\nstruggles since the Lithium had been held and\nfurther evaluation was still needed.\n• The 03/07/2023 documentation describes Youth A\nhaving an echo cardiogram the day prior and how\n13",
    "those results would be informative and determine\nthe next course of action for her overall health and\nthe use of Lithium. Youth A stated in this\ndocumentation that she had not shown any\nsignificant struggles since the Lithium had been\nheld.\n• The 03/14/2023 documentation stated that results of\nthe 03/06/2023 echo cardiogram had been received\nand that Youth A showed normal cardiac anatomy\nand function, but the results of the Holter monitor\nthat had been prescribed had not yet been\nreceived. In this documentation Psychiatrist 1\nrecommended that the Lithium still not be prescribed\nuntil recommended testing had been completed.\n• The 03/28/2023 documentation contained discussion\nof Youth A’s impending graduation of the program\nand that the facility was still waiting on the final\nreport from the Holter monitor testing for further\naction.\n• Medical documentation from Great Lakes Bay Health\nCenters dated 02/07/2023. During a well child visit it was\ndiscovered that Youth A had an abnormal finding on an\nEKG.\n• Medical documentation from Mid-Michigan Pediatric\nCardiology dated 03/08/2023. Youth A’s abnormal EKG\nreadings were reviewed during this appointment, and she\nwas referred for further cardiac evaluation. A halter monitor\nwas prescribed, and it was recommended that lithium be\ndiscontinued temporarily as a psychotropic medication\nwhile more information on Youth A’s heart be gathered.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews and documentation review there\nwas not sufficient evidence that the medication management for\nYouth A was performed out of accordance to the rule. Per the\nmental health code there are no consent requirements for the\ndecreasing of a dosage of a medication within the approved range\nor the elimination of a psychotropic medication.\nConsultation Provided: Consultation was provided to the facility\nregarding having clear policies and procedures covering when\nconsent is required and sought from parents and guardians for the\nintroduction of new medications for youth in placement, as well as\nadjustments to new or current medications up to and including the\ndiscontinuation of those medications.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n14",

During the face-to-face\ninterview with Youth A’s parent on 04/12/2023 she clarified this\nfurther to state that she had participated in phone calls, video\nvisits, video meetings and court hearings with Youth A during her\nplacement. Youth A’s parent stated there was minimal parenting\ntime offered by the facility. She initially stated she had never\nspoken to or seen her daughter while she was placed, but further\nalong in to the conversation stated that she did in fact have\ncontact with her daughter over the phone, video and some face-\nto-face visits at the facility. Youth A’s parent stated she was not\nable to visit more often because of a stretch of time spent in the\nhospital and because of the distance from her home to the facility.\nShe could not state there were any specific actions that precluded\nher from visiting Youth A caused by facility staff and stated that\nshe was pleased with the new placement for Youth A at the time\nbecause it was closer to home.\nDuring an announced, face to face visit at her new placement\nYouth A was interviewed on 04/12/2023. Youth A stated that she\nhad only seen her parent infrequently during her stay at the\nfacility. Youth A stated she had been able to call her parent once\nto twice a week depending on the daily schedule of the program\nwhile she was placed there. She stated there were some\noccasions when a phone call was not able to be made because of\nescalated behaviors of herself or other youth in the program, and\nthat there were many other times when she would call her parent\nand not get an answer.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Documentation provided by the facility showed the following\nfrequency of contact between Youth A and her parent\nduring the course of her placement (09/27/2022-\n04/04/2023): A total of 37 contacts had been recorded\ninvolving Youth A and Youth A’s parent during her 190 day\n15",
    "placement at the program, including phone calls, video\nvisits and meetings and court hearings.\n• The Program Statement for the program does not specify\nspecific amount or frequency of visitation between youth\nplaced and their parents/guardians, but does state that they\noffer “supervised family visits with transportation offered.”\n• Facility policy titled “Procedures for involving youth families”\nwas received and reviewed. In this internal policy it is\nstated that the facility will attempt to involve families by\ninviting them to engage in meetings with an assigned\nFamily Worker twice per month, as well as outlining how\nyouth are allowed to have one phone call per week to their\nfamilies. In addition, there is unlimited access to writing\nmaterial for youth to maintain written contact with family\nmembers.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews there was not sufficient evidence\nfound to support a rule violation regarding the provision of\nvisitation arrangements or contact with parents for youth in the\nfacility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(b) The services provided to residents and parents directly\nby the institution and the services provided by outside\nresources.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A was not provided with consistent therapy programming\nwhile placed at the facility.\nInvestigation Youth A’s parent was interviewed over the phone on 04/12/2023.\nDuring this interview she stated that Youth A had received “little to\nno therapy” while she was placed at the facility.

Youth A stated she had\nseen multiple therapists over the course of her treatment\nindividually about once a week, as well as had group therapy\nsessions run by several different staff at about the same\nfrequency. Youth A stated that there had been some group\n16",
    "therapy sessions where the staff running them had begun the\nsession by stating “What do you all want to talk about today?”\nShe did state, as well as her parent, that she did not feel like she\nbenefited from this treatment very much.\nDuring an unannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on\n06/13/2023 Therapist 1 was interviewed. Therapist 1 stated that\nshe had likely run some group sessions involving Youth A but that\nshe was not her assigned individual therapist during her\nplacement. Therapist 1 was also able to confirm exact dates of\ntherapy appointments for Youth A through their records and noted\nthat there were some requirements missed during the time of early\n2023 when a contracted therapist had been brought on to provide\nvirtual services to youth placed.\nTherapist 2 was interviewed over the phone on 06/16/2023. She\nstated that she had seen Youth A for some appointments earlier\non in her placement and did not believe that any had been\nmissed, but that she had to go on a medical leave in December\n2022 and had not had contact with Youth A since that time.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Documentation received from the facility covered\nSeptember 2022-April 2023, covering the 28 weeks that\nYouth A was in placement.

In this statement services for placed youth are\ndescribed, including that youth will receive “twice weekly\ntherapeutic interventions” including individual and group\ntherapy.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews and documentation review there\nwas sufficient evidence that the therapeutic services provided to\nYouth A did not meet the minimal requirements as outlined by the\nagency's policies and procedures.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the\nDescription direct supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable\n17",
