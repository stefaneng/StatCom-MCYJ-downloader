    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection\nDescription (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\npolicies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth H allegedly “cheeked” medications, hid them in her room\nand ingested them at once on 9/18/23.\nInvestigation I interviewed Complainant, also Foster Care Supervisor, via\nphone. She said she read documents from Vista Maria that raised\nconcerns about how Youth H gets access to medication. Prior to\nreporting these allegations, Complainant said she and Youth H’s\nfoster care worker have been involved in Vista Maria treatment\nplanning meetings and have “followed through with all of the tasks\nVista Maria requested.” Complainant said her second-line\nsupervisor told her to report these allegations.\nI notified Youth H’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation\nassignment. She expressed no additional concerns.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nAn incident report on 9/1/23 at 7:30pm indicated Youth H informed\nStaff 3 that she swallowed a “fidget.” Thirty minutes later she told\nthe same staff she ingested some pills that she had stashed in her\nbra. No one saw Youth H swallow anything. However, based on\nher self-report, she was transported to Garden City Hospital.\nAccording to the hospital report, Youth H then told medical\nprofessionals she did not ingest any pills. Lab test results were\nnegative for an overdose and abdomen x-rays showed no foreign\nbody (fidget) present. Youth H remained hospitalized for nearly\ntwo weeks for suicidal ideation and then discharged back to Vista\nMaria on 9/13/23.\nOn 9/17/23 Youth H grabbed a first aid kit in a vehicle and\nswallowed two over-the-counter aspirin. Details of this incident is\nfound in the next allegation below.\nOn 9/18/23 at 9:00am, an incident report by Therapist indicated\n“Youth H quickly grabbed something from the side of her bed and\n2",
    "placed it in her mouth and began drinking apple juice. Staff 3\nquickly grabbed the apple juice and told Youth H to spit out what\nshe had in her mouth.” Youth H told the staff she already\nswallowed it.” Staff 3 asked Youth H what she swallowed and\nwhere she got it. Youth H told her it was a pill but refused to say\nhow she got it.\nAt 10:00 am on 9/18/23 an incident report indicated Youth H told\nNurse 1 she swallowed a pill, but also refused to tell Nurse\nhow/where she got it. Youth H was not taken to the hospital on\nthat occasion.\nI interviewed Nurse 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. She\nindicated Youth H is diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress\nDisorder, Major Depressive Disorder and Rule Out Borderline\nPersonality Disorder. Nurse 2 noted Youth H has been\ntransported to the emergency room twelve times since she was\nadmitted to Vista Maria in April 2023. The emergency room visits\nwere all for self-reported attempts to harm herself ranging from\nclaims to having ingested unknown pills and foreign objects to\ninserting objects into her vagina.\nNurse 2 said Youth H is prescribed a total of 14 pills per day. To\nreduce the risk of her hiding pills in her mouth, I asked Nurse 2 if\nher pills can be crushed prior to dispensing. Nurse 2 affirmed that\nsome of them can, and others cannot. She agreed to consult with\nthe youth’s psychiatrist.\nI interviewed Therapist jointly with Government Worker 1. As\nindicated in the incident report, while in Youth H’s room, she said\nshe saw her grab “something” and put it in her mouth. Youth H\ntold Therapist it was a pill but refused to provide additional\ninformation.\nI interviewed Team Leader jointly with Government Worker 1.\nShe said Youth H told her she “cheeked” and later ingested her\nown medication, but Team Leader has never seen her do it. Most,\nif not all, of her attempts to harm herself are by her own self-report\nand not witnessed by staff. Team Leader also said that whenever\nYouth H’s room has been searched and cleared, no harmful items\nhave been found.\nI interviewed Youth H jointly with Government Worker. She\nunderstood the meaning of the “cheeking” medication and\nexplained “It’s when you hide pills in your mouth to take a bunch\nlater.” A couple weeks ago, Youth H claimed she “cheeked” a\n3",
    "total of five pills on three separate occasions because she wanted\nto die. She said Supervisors usually have her open her mouth to\nmake sure she swallowed her pills. She did not remember what\nSupervisor passed her medication the time(s) she hid them in her\nmouth.\nYouth H said she stored the five pills on the floor between her bed\nand the wall and swallowed them when staff were not present.\nShe said no staff person saw the pills or saw her swallow them.\nTen minutes after ingesting them, Youth H said she told Team\nLeader what she did. “They sent me to the hospital emergency\nroom for two weeks then sent me back.”\nI interviewed Supervisor who has worked at the facility for nine\nyears. She said she passes medication to Youth H and has never\ncaught her “cheeking.” “I asked her to open her mouth and cough.\nI look in her mouth and make sure she drinks a full cup of\nwater…It’s still possible to “cheek” them though.” To her\nknowledge, Supervisor said all staff follow this procedure.\nI interviewed Team Leader who has worked at the facility for over\nfour years. She said she passes medication to Youth H and has\nnever caught her “cheeking.” “I tell them to open their mouth,\ncough and drink plenty of water.”\nI reviewed the facility’s medication policy. The policy states that\nsupervisors passing medication should: “Carefully watch the client\ntake medication and verify all pills have been swallowed by\nchecking the mouth for any retained medication.” The way this is\nverified is by having the youth open her mouth to show she\nswallowed the pills.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis While Youth H clearly knows how to “cheek” medication, at this\npoint there is no evidence she hid pills in her mouth and ingested\nthem later. No staff at Vista Maria ever actually saw the pills she\nclaimed to have hidden and ingested. After Youth H claimed to\nhave ingested extra pills on 9/1/23, a lab test showed no evidence\nof an overdose or higher than expected levels of drugs in her\nsystem. The referral source and treatment team at Vista Maria\nwill continue collaborating strategies to keep Youth H safe.\nCONSULTATION\nHaving youths open their mouths guards against “cheeking” but\ndoes not fully prevent it. The only way to assure Youth H does not\n4",
    "hide pills in her mouth would be to discontinue all of her\nmedications. Another way to lower the risk would be to crush her\nprescribed pills before dispensing them. These are decisions that\ncan only be by made by her treating psychiatrist. Otherwise, the\nclinical treatment team should continue brainstorming strategies to\nprotect Youth H from possessing pills and other items that can be\ningested or inserted.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (2) Resident medications shall be kept in the original pharmacy\nDescription supplied container until dispensed, shall be kept with the\nequipment to administer it in a locked area, and refrigerated, if\nrequired.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth H allegedly took unknown medication from a first aid kit in a\nfacility vehicle and ingested it.\nInvestigation On 9/17/23 Youth H said she was in the van with Staff 1 and 2\nand refused to exit the vehicle. Staff 1 and 2 exited the vehicle\nand went on either side of it to encourage her out of the van.\nYouth H said she locked the doors with the staff outside, jumped\ninto the front seat, opened a first aid kit, removed a packet of over-\nthe-counter pain reliever (two pills), and swallowed them before\nthe staff could unlock the door. Again, Youth H said she took the\ntwo pills because she wanted to die.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1. She has\nworked at the facility for one year. Upon returning to Youth H to\nVista Maria from another hospital run on 9/17/23, Staff 1 said she\nand Staff 2 asked Youth H to exit the vehicle. Youth H laid in the\nback seat refusing to exit. Staff 1 and 2 stepped out of the vehicle\nto the back doors. Youth H jumped over the seats to the front,\ngrabbed a first aid kit from the driver’s side door pocket, and\nswallowed a small packet of non-aspirin pills. After that, Youth H\nwillingly walked to the residential building. Staff notified the facility\nnurse and Youth H was not returned to the hospital.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. She has\nworked at the facility for one month. She said she, Staff 1 and\nYouth H returned back to Vista Maria from the hospital. Staff 1\nwas in the passenger seat and Youth H was in the backseat\n5",
    "alone. After parking, Youth H refused to exit the van. “Staff 1\nopened the door to the backseat. I saw Youth H hop up to the\nfront and grab a first aid kit from somewhere. I didn’t know there\nwas a first aid kit in the van. I heard Staff 1 tell Youth H not to\ntake pills. I did not see her swallow any pills. Youth H walked to\nthe building after that on her own…The nurse or supervisor said it\nwas aspirin she took.”\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis Youth H accessed over-the-counter pain reliever from a first aid kit\nshe found in a Vista Maria vehicle. The licensing rule indicates all\nmedication should be kept in a locked area.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and a corrective action plan is required.\nOctober 31, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 31, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
