    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff Person 1 choked Youth A.\nInvestigation I reviewed intake dated 06/16/2023. It states Staff Person 1\ntugged at Youth A’s arm as he was getting water at the drinking\nfountain. Staff Person 1 was then observed putting her hands\naround Youth A’s neck and pulled him away. It appeared Staff\nPerson 1 choked Youth A as she grabbed him by the neck. Youth\nA was interviewed and stated that Staff Person 1 put her hand on\nthe back of his neck. Youth A has no marks or bruising.\nI reviewed incident report dated 06/15/2023. It states a staff and a\nclient witnessed possible abuse of a client by a staff person.\nStatements are as follows: Staff Person 1’s statement indicates\nresidents lining up in the gym and Youth A at the drinking fountain.\nAnother youth told Youth A to run, and that Staff Person 1 stuck\nher arm out to gain control and to prevent Youth A from running.\nStaff Person 1 states her knee buckled and that she fell toward\nYouth A. Staff Person 2’s statement indicates that Staff Person 1\ngrabbed Youth A’s arm to pull him away from the drinking fountain\nand then placed her hand under his chin/throat and pulled him\naway. Staff Person 3’s statement indicates Staff Person 1\ndirected Youth A away from the drinking fountain by the arm.\nI interviewed Complainant/Case Manager onsite on 06/20/2023.\nHe states Staff Person 2 brought Youth B to him and said that he\nhad something to say. He reports Youth B and Staff Person 2\nreported that they believed Staff Person 1 tugged Youth A by the\narm and pull him by the neck. When Complainant/Case Manger\nspoke with Youth A, he denied being choked or pulled away.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite on 06/20/2023. He states the group\nwas lining up in the gym to return to the main building and that he\nwas getting a drink of water from the fountain. He states Staff\nPerson 1 placed her hand across his shoulder from behind and\nsaid to him that it was time to go and that he walked away. Youth\nA denies Staff Person 1 grabbing him in anyway, that she did not\ngrab him by his neck or throat, and only directed him toward the\nline of residents.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite on 06/20/2023. He states Staff\nPerson 1 yanked Youth A by the arm and side of neck before\ngrabbing hold of Youth A by the front of his neck to direct him\naway.\n2",
    "I interviewed Manager onsite in 06/202/2023. Manager notes\nhaving observed Youth B’s interactions with Staff Person 1 and\nstates Youth B does not like Staff Person 1 because she is\nstructured and holds youth accountable for their actions.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 via telephone on 06/21/2023. She\nreports previously working for the facility for 16 years and was\nrehired in 12/2023. Review of her personnel record indicates she\nis up to date with her behavior management training. She reports\nthe residents were lining up inside the gym to return to the main\nbuilding. Youth A was getting a drink of water and that another\nresident expressed that he wanted to run from the gym. She\nreports placing her hand on Youth A’s shoulder when her knee\nbuckled and that she slightly lunged downward. Staff Person 1\nstates that she did not yank Youth A’s arm or grab him by the jaw\nor neck as alleged. She states then guiding Youth A back to the\nline of other residents.\nI interviewed Staff Person 2 via telephone on 06/2/2203. He\nreports being employed by the facility for six months. He states\nbeing positioned behind Staff Person 1 and Youth A as he was at\nthe drinking fountain. He states observing Staff Person 1 have\nher hand on the back of Youth A’s arm and that she may have\npossibly stumbled. Staff Peron 2 states it looked like Staff Person\n1 pulled Youth A by the jaw though states he did not actually\nobserve Youth A’s throat and bases his observations on Staff\nPerson 1’s positioning of her wrist and fingers. Staff Person 2\nstates Youth B was standing with him during the alleged incident.\nAdditional residents were not interviewed as they were lined up\nnear the exit and in the opposite direction of where the drinking\nfountain was located.\nI reviewed video surveillance of the gymnasium dated 06/15/2023\nat 3:49PM. It shows a group of residents and staff lining up near\nan exit. Staff Person 1 has her arm extended toward Youth A by\nthe drinking fountain and the group then begins to exit the\ngymnasium. A gymnasium hoist is slightly blocking the view. No\noutward movement of a struggle is observed.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to indicate that Staff Person 1 choked Youth\nA, or pulled him away by his jaw and arm, nor utilized any form of\nbehavior management, or was attempting to discipline him in any\nmanner. It appears Staff Person 1 had her arm extended toward\nYouth A while at the drinking fountain to direct him in the direction\nof other residents. She reports her knee buckling and that she\n3",
