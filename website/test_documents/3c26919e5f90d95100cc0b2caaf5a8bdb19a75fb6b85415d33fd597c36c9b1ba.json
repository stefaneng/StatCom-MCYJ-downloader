    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12303 Policy and procedures.\nSection (2) An agency may not be more restrictive than the department's\nDescription policies or administrative rules governing licensing and services.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency emailed foster parents and indicated there will be four\nmeetings again as they did in 2023 for a total amount of 8 hours of\nmandatory training. However, the policy they had a foster parent\nsign about training stated they only had to attend a total of six\nhours of training each year and only 3 of those had to be with\nMDHHS. In addition to this the fourth and final meetings of 2023,\nthe foster parent was told if they did not attend the meeting, they\ncould face a CAP.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nI had contact with Complainant by email on 1/20/2025; and\n1/27/2025. Complainant wanted to maintain anonymity and\nindicated they would only communicate on these allegations by\nemail to protect themselves. Complainant indicated as a foster\nparent they signed a policy which indicates they are required to\nparticipate in 3 hours of DHHS (Department of Health and Human\nService) training a year and 6 hours overall. They indicated the\nagency sends out quarterly mandatory 2-hour trainings which\nwould total 8 hours of training to occur specifically with DHHS.\nComplainant indicated the email sent out from DHHS about\ntomorrow’s (1/21/2025) mandatory 2-hour training, and the email\ndocument sent out to foster parents in 2024 said if foster parents\ndid not attend they could face having to complete a corrective\naction plan (CAP).\nComplainant wrote that the agency indicated in the most recent\nmandatory meeting this year that as foster parents they have to\nattend these quarterly meetings, which are four times a year and\nare always 2 hours long. Complainant expressed concern that\nthese requirements by DHHS are against the rules.\nChief Administrator\nOn 1/21/2025 I spoke with Chief Administrator about the\nallegations onsite. Chief administrator provided copies of licensing\ndocuments\nLicensing Supervisor 1\n2",
    "On 1/21/2025 I interviewed Licensing Supervisor (LS) 1 about the\nallegations onsite. LS 1 reported the agency’s policy does not\nrequire foster parents to obtain 8 hours of training annually. Nor\ndoes it require any additional hours of training other than the 6-\nhours that’s required by the rule. She said their agency’s checklist\ndocuments that only 6 hours of training is required annually.\nShe reported the agency does notify all foster parents via email\nthat they are mandated to attend all four foster parent training\nmeetings via DHHS; and that 3 hours of their 6 hours of required\nannual training must be completed via DHHS- North Central. She\nreported the most recent email to foster parent about this was sent\non 1/8/2025.\nLS 1 denied ever telling foster parents verbally or in writing that if\nthey did not attend the mandatory meetings and training via\nDHHS-North Central that the agency would investigate them for a\ncorrective action plan. She reported the agency had explored\ndoing the latter internally. That conversations went back and forth\non the matter. She reported on 9/26/2023 they spoke with the\nlicensing team about that possibility, that if the foster parent did\nnot comply with attending the mandatory meetings/trainings, the\nagency could look at requiring that a corrective action plan be\ndone. She reported ultimately the matter was left as an open\nissue; they never attempted to open a special evaluation on any\nfoster family for not attending the mandatory meetings.\nLicensing Staff\nOn 1/27/2025, I interviewed Licensing Worker (LW) 1 and\nLicensing Supervisor (LS) 2 via Teams. I interviewed Licensing\nWorker (LW) 2 and Licensing Worker (LW) 3 via Teams on\n2/5/2025.\nAll four-licensing staff reported information as LS 1 had related to\nfoster parents only being required to complete 6 hours of training\nper year, with 3 hours being mandatory via DHHS North Central.\nEach staff person reported some clarifying statements:\nLicensing Worker 1 denied personally telling a foster parent or\nhearing of anyone telling a foster parent that if they did not attend\na mandatory meeting they will be required to complete a\ncorrective action plan. She reported the mandatory foster parent\nmeetings are not always four times a year and foster parents are\nnot penalized if they do not attend them. She reported the\nmeetings are not really mandatory. It is just their way of\nencouraging and motivating foster parents to get their required\nnumber of training hours.\n3",
    "Licensing Supervisor 2 reported the foster parent meetings are\noffered four times a year and each session is 2 hours. He reported\nfoster parents do not have to attend all 4 sessions. They do have\nto get 3 hours of their training via DHHS- North Central, but they\nalso encourage foster parents to obtain training via other sources.\nLS 2 reported foster parents could have a special evaluation and\ncorrective action plan open against them for not attending one of\nthe mandatory meeting, LS reported there was a discussion on\nthis matter sometime after he started with North Central (July of\n2024) and he discussed this with his staff in August or September\nof 2024. Staff were to advise foster parents that since they had\nsigned the agency’s policies, and foster parent agency agreement,\nthey were required to get the 3 hours of training via DHHS- North\nCentral.\nLicensing Worker 2 reported the agency offers trainings every\nsecond Tuesday of the month and there are mandatory foster\nparent meetings held every three months. She indicated these\nmeetings/training enable foster parents to get the training they\nneed. LW 2 reported although their email to foster parents indicate\nit’s a mandatory meeting being held everyone does not show up.\nLW 2 also acknowledged there had been a time foster parents\nwere to be advised that if they did not attend a mandatory meeting\nthey could be placed on a corrective action plan or have a special\nevaluation open against their license. She reported the matter\nwas never followed up on because the agency had contact with\nDCWL and were advised that was not permissible per the rules.\nLicensing Worker 3 was not clear as to whether a foster parent\nhad to attend all of the mandatory foster parent meetings offered\nby DHHS North Central or just one of them. She too, recalled a\ndiscussion and possible email to foster parents last year about\nfoster parents possibly being placed on a corrective action plan for\nnot attending mandatory foster parent meeting, but she could not\nrecall when that may have happened.\nDocument review:\nDocuments from the Chief Administrator that included:\n• A foster home checklist and foster parent training sign off\nform that indicated 6-hours of training is required of foster\nparents with 3 hours being mandatory via DHHS- North\nCentral.\n• A copy of a 1/8/2025 email to foster parents was also\nincluded. It indicated the agency’s next quarterly mandatory\nfoster parent meeting is January 21, 2025. That there\n4",
    "would be two sessions offered at the agency on that day,\none at 10AM-12PM and another at 6 PM-8 PM. Foster\nparents were to respond to the email or to let their licensing\nworker know if childcare would be needed.\nCopy of a 9/11/2024 email to foster parents announcing a\n10/15/2024 foster parent meeting with the agency offering a\n10:00am-12 noon or 6:00pm- 8:00pm session. The email\nindicated the following:\n• The “quarterly MANDATORY foster parent meeting” was\ncoming up and foster parents were to attend one of the\nsessions offered.\n• The email reminded foster parents they were expected to\nattend each of the mandatory meetings.\n• Any foster parent that had not attended a mandatory\nmeeting in the last year must attend the upcoming meeting\nor be at risk of a corrective action plan and/or special\nevaluation.\nCopy of the agency’s Foster Parent Agency Agreement (DHS-\n1798) which showed:\n• On page two, the agreement’s number 12 statement that\nindicated as a foster parent they agree “To attend foster\nparent training when requested to do so by the\ndepartment.”\nDHHS Policy FOM 922-Foster Family Recruitment, Support and\nDevelopment- Ongoing Training which indicates:\n• Ongoing training is any training that is offered after the\ninitial orientation and pre-licensure training.\n• Each child placing agency is required to have an annual\ntraining plan.\n• Each foster parent must complete at least six hours of\ntraining per calendar year.\n• No mandate on where the foster parent’s training must\ncome from or mandatory foster parent meetings.\nFoster Home Licensing rule R 400.9416(1) Foster parent training\nwhich indicates:\n• Each licensed foster parent must attend training as\nrequired by the agency’s foster parent training plan, totaling\nto at least 6 hours per year.\n• No mandate on where the foster parent’s training must\ncome from or mandatory foster parent meetings.\n5",
    "Analysis Based on interviews and document reviewed the evidence\nshowed the agency’s mandate for foster parents to attend\nquarterly meetings, and 3 hours of their training hours via DHHS\nNorth Central, is more restrictive than the department's policies or\nadministrative rules. The rules do not mandate a foster parent to\ncomplete any number of training hours via their certifying agency.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency\ncurrent license status is recommended.\nMarch 17, 2025\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 28, 2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n6"
