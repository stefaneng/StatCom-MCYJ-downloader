    "Allegation On 12/16/22, youth was sitting on the floor and had refused to get up.\nStaff member was observed kicking youth multiple times. A bruise was\nobserved on youth's right arm and there is concern youth may develop\nbruises on their back/side area as well.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on December\n19, 2022, in collaboration with DHHS Worker. Youth A described\ngetting upset at school and running out of the building. Youth A stated\nhe ran around the building and tried to re-enter through double doors\nwhere Teacher and Staff 2 met him. Youth A reported sitting on the\nground in the middle of the double doors. Youth A stated Staff 2 kicked\nYouth A onetime in the right elbow. Youth A reported Staff 2 did not\nsay anything when Staff 2 kicked Youth A. Youth A stated Teacher\nwas standing close to Youth A and Staff 2 was standing to the side of\nYouth A. Youth A denied other youth or staff witnessing the kick.\nYouth A showed DHHS Worker and I a yellowish bruise on his right\ninner elbow.\nTherapist was interviewed face to face at the facility on December\n19, 2022, in collaboration with DHHS Worker. Therapist denied\nYouth A talking about this incident in therapy. Therapist stated Youth A\nhas been focused on moving to a different house. Therapist reported\nYouth A being in a good spot for placement.\nTeacher was interviewed face to face at the facility on December\n19, 2022, in collaboration with DHHS Worker. Teacher reported\nYouth A left school and tried to come in the double doors of Holbrook\n(main entrance to building). Teacher stated Youth A sat down on his\nbutt, against the wall in the middle of the double doors and began\nkicking Staff 2. Teacher described Youth A swinging his arms toward\nStaff 2 and screaming. Teacher reported the area in-between the\ndoors is very small, so Youth A, Staff 2 and Teacher were all close to\none another. Teacher denied Staff 2 kicked Youth A. Teacher stated\nStaff 2 tried stepping back from Youth A but there was no room so Staff\n2 would pivot at the waist to block Youth A from hitting Staff 2. Teacher\nstated Staff 2 was asking Youth A what he needed but that was all Staff\n2 was saying to Youth A. Teacher denied any youth being present.\nTeacher stated Supervisor came to the doors, got Youth A, and went to\nSupervisor’s office.\nNurse was interviewed face to face at the facility on December 19,\n2022, in collaboration with DHHS Worker. Nurse reported examining\nYouth A after the incident and seeing one bruise, multiple colors that\nwould have been there prior to the incident.\n4",
    "Supervisor/Complainant was interviewed face to face at the facility\non December 19, 2022, in collaboration with DHHS Worker.\nSupervisor/Complainant described being in an office, looking out the\nwindow, and seeing Youth A exit the school without staff.\nSupervisor/Complainant stated she stood up, headed to the front of the\nbuilding, and heard Staff 2 say lock Holbrook. Supervisor/Complainant\nreported walking to the double doors when Staff 1 came out from\nbehind the check in counter saying, “he’s kicking him, he’s kicking him.”\nSupervisor/Complainant described seeing the top of Youth A’s head,\nTeacher standing in front of the right door, Staff 2 standing to the side\nof Youth A, and Staff 2’s leg move up and back down. The double\ndoors are glass only on the top half of the door and a black metal\nmaterial on the lower half of the door, making it so you cannot see.\nSupervisor/Complainant stated seeing Staff 2’s leg motion but did not\nactually see Staff 2’s leg connect with Youth A.\nSupervisor/Complainant reported seeing at least two kicks and heard\nYouth A say, “he’s kicking me, he’s kicking me.”\nSupervisor/Complainant reported she opened the door, told Staff 2 he\nwas released and brought Youth A to the office.\nSupervisor/Complainant denied hearing Staff 2 say anything when she\napproached the double doors or when she opened the door to get\nYouth A.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on December 19,\n2022, in collaboration with DHHS Worker. Staff 1 described from her\narea at the check in desk hearing Youth A scream, “you kicked me” to\nStaff 2. Staff 1 reported Teacher, Staff 2, and Youth A were in-between\nthe double doors of the entrance into Holbrook. Staff 1 stated she saw\nthe back-and-forth motion and the top of Staff 2’s leg move more than\none time. Staff 1 stated she approached the double doors, but\nSupervisor/Complainant had just arrived, so Staff 1 went back by the\ncheck in desk. Staff 2 reported Supervisor/Complainant said something\nto Staff 2, talked with Youth A and then brought Youth A to\nSupervisor/Complainant’s office. Staff 1 stated she did not see the\nimpact of the kick, but Staff 2 seemed annoyed.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on December 19,\n2022, in collaboration with DHHS Worker. Staff 2 described Youth A\ngetting upset while in school, running out of the building and running to\nthe entrance of Holbrook. Staff 2 stated he met Youth A at the\nentrance along with Teacher. Staff 2 reported Youth A fell to the\nground in-between the double doors and started hitting Staff 2 with his\narm. Staff 2 stated he pivoted to protect his groin area as that is where\nYouth A was hitting Staff 2. Staff 2 described Youth A sitting on the\nground with his back against the wall with Staff 2 on Youth A’s left side.\nStaff 2 stated after making the pivot motion, Youth A screamed “you\n4",
    "kicked me.” Staff 2 denied kicking or making any contact with Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported Supervisor/Complainant opened the door and removed\nYouth A. Staff 2 stated he believes Supervisor/Complainant thought\nStaff 2 was kicking Youth A. Staff 2 reported his foot never left the\nground, that he pivoted from the waist to turn to avoid getting punched\nby Youth A. Staff 2 stated the area was so small there was no way to\nstep back from Youth A swinging his arm.\nYouth B was interviewed via telephone on January 9, 2022, in\ncollaboration with DHHS Worker. Youth B reported things are going\nwell at the facility and not having any concerns with staff or how staff\nconduct restraints.\nDHHS Worker has no findings in the investigation.\nTour Observation:\nDHHS Worker, Staff 2 and I went to the double door entry to Holbrook.\nDHHS Worker and Staff 2 stood in-between the double doors while I\nstood outside of the doors. Staff 2 demonstrated the pivoting motion\nthat he described during the interview. I was unable to see Staff 2 from\nthe waist down while he was standing in-between the double doors.\nThe motion of Staff 2’s body could possibly look like a kicking motion.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Staff 2’s personnel file: There was disciplinary action in 2022 for\na safety plan not being followed, 2012 pre-packaging medication\nfor a home pass and 2008 for improper restraint technique. Staff\n2 completed the required Aegis training on 01/26/2022.\n• Staff 2’s written statement to the facility regarding the incident\nwhich was consistent with Staff 2’s interview.\n• Youth A’s written statement regarding the incident which was\nconsistent with Youth A’s interview.\n• Eagle Village Health Care Visit Report dated 12/16/2022 for\nYouth A: “A light brown/black/green bruise was seen on his\nanterior/lateral upper arm proximal to his elbow. The bruise was\ncircular and about the size of a quarter. He had soft tissue\ntenderness and full ROM of his upper extremity.” This exam was\nthe same day of the incident.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as Supervisor/Complainant and Staff\n1 did not actually see Staff 2’s foot make contact with Youth A. A\nperson seeing Staff 2’s pivot motion from outside the double doors\ncould reasonably think Staff 2 was kicking Youth A. Interview with\nTeacher and Staff 2 deny Staff 2 kicking Youth A. The bruise on Youth\nA’s right arm was an older bruise and located on the arm opposite of\nwhere Staff 2 was standing next to Youth A.\n4",
