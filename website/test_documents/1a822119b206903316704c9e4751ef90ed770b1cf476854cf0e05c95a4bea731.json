    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth A was AWOL from Methodist and located by LE. Youth A was uncontrollable,\nand aggressive toward himself and LE. LE transported Youth A to the hospital for\nan evaluation. LE waited two hours to receive necessary info from Methodist staff.\nThe facility refused to send a staff person to the hospital to relieve LE.\nINVESTIGATION:\nIntake\nMISACWIS indicated that Police Officer 1 (PO 1) received the information/allegation\nhe reported from “other law enforcement officers.” Those officers were not identified\nin MISACWIS and thus, could not be interviewed.\nInterviews\nI interviewed Youth A, age 12, jointly with Government Worker 1. He has been at\nthe facility for nine months. Youth A said he and Youth M went AWOL together and\nwalked to Walmart on Sunday evening. After that “We found a pole and I started\nbanging my head on it. The police came. I threw a rock at him and spit on him. I\nasked the police to take me to the hospital.” Youth A said Staff 1 stayed with him at\nthe hospital and was relieved by Staff 2. Youth A was psychiatrically cleared and\nreturned to Methodist the next day.\nYouth A stated he routinely bangs his head when he is upset. He was upset\nbecause he thought “Youth M called the cops on a phone he stole from Walmart.”\nYouth A said he feels safe at Methodist but “likes to go off-campus” without\npermission.\nI interviewed Off-Duty Shift Supervisor (ODSS 1). On Sunday at 8:38pm, he said\nhe at home eating dinner when he received a call from the police on his personal cell\nphone. It is unclear why the police contacted his personal cell.\nOn the date of the incident, ODSS 1 said he was not working and was not the\ndesignated on-call supervisor or administrator. “They (police) had collected Youth M\nand A and they were on 7 Mile and Inkster Road (in Livonia). He wanted Methodist\nto send someone to get both kids at that location. At 8:42pm, while enroute to the\ncampus, ODSS 1 said “I called Livonia Police Department and asked them to\ntransport the kids back to Methodist (instead of Methodist staff picking them up).\nFirst the officer refused, then he agreed but notified me he would be making a\ncomplaint against Methodist. Youth M was dropped off at Methodist and the police\ntook Youth A to the hospital. At 9:12pm, I dispatched Staff 1 to the hospital. At\n9:14pm, I called him (police) to give him Staff 1’s name.” At 11pm, ODSS 1 said he\nand Staff 2 went to the hospital. “I wanted to check on Youth A who was sleeping.”\n3",
    "Staff 2 remained with Youth A and Staff 1 went home. ODSS 1 denied he or anyone\nat Methodist ever refused to pick the youths up in Livonia or send a staff person to\nsupervise Youth A at the hospital.\nI interviewed On-Call Administrator 1 (OCA 1) jointly with Government Worker 1.\nHe said he was “on-call” that evening. ODSS 1 contacted OCA 1 after the police\ncalled ODSS 1 at home. ODSS 1 and OCA 1 coordinated with the police by phone\nand assigned Staff 1 to go supervise Youth A at the hospital. According to ODSS 1,\nStaff 1 was dispatched to the hospital approximately 30 minutes after he received\nthe initial call from police.\nI interviewed Acting Supervisor 1 (AS 1) jointly with Government Worker 1. AS 1‘s\nofficial title is Methodist’s Director of Children’s Services. Director of Children’s\nServices is not a position regulated by DCWL, but Supervisor of Direct Care\nWorkers is. AS 1 said the afternoon shift supervisor called off on 10/10/21 so she\ncovered his shift and was physically present on campus until 8pm.\nEmployee File\nI reviewed AS 1’s resume. Per licensing Rule 400.4120, AS 1 has worked in a child\ncaring institution for at least two years and is qualified to supervise direct care\nworkers.\nAccording to Acting Chief Administrator 1 (ACA 1), a shift supervisor typically\nworks until 11pm. Rather than stay until 11pm, AS 1 told me she checked that the\ncottages were quiet, forwarded the calls to OCA 1 and left the campus around 8pm.\nYouths A and M had gone AWOL at 5:45pm and were still missing when AS 1 left\nthe campus for the night.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: There is no evidence to support that Methodist refused to send\na staff person to the hospital as alleged, as Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere both there to supervise Youth A. According to ODSS 1,\nMethodist did not refuse to pick up the youths from 7 mile and\nInkster Rd. ODSS 1 said he merely asked police officers if they\ncould transport the children back to the facility. After the police\nagreed, they told ODSS 1 that they would be filing a complaint.\nThere is a violation however, as Methodist is required to have a\nsufficient number of supervisors on duty and present at the\nfacility. On 10/10/21. AS 1 went home leaving the campus\nunsupervised from 8pm - 11pm. ODSS 1 responded to a call\nfrom police on his personal cell phone. He was not “on-call” at\nthe time but went to campus anyway and handled the situation\non his scheduled day off.\nCONSULTATION\nMethodist is an open campus for abuse/neglect wards. The exit\ndoors in the cottages are not secure and do not prevent children\nfrom leaving. Further, staff are not permitted to physically\nrestrain children to prevent them from leaving. Youth at high\nrisk for truancy may be better served if placed in a secure\nfacility.\nThat said, the local police are clearly frustrated by the number of\nAWOLs and calls to intervene with Methodist youth. It is\nstrongly recommended that Methodist’s Administration meet\nwith the local police to improve their relationship with community\npartners.\nBased on the numbers and type of children Methodist serves,\nthe physical presence of at least one supervisor is crucial on all\nthree shifts.\nIt is also strongly recommended that Methodist ensures the local\npolice know how to contact the supervisor on campus or the on-\ncall administrator outside of normal business hours.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nAny staff person, including Directors and Administrators, who\ncover a vacant DCWL-regulated position such as Supervisor of\nDirect Care Staff must also qualify and be trained for that\nposition per the licensing rules.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "(Repeat Violation)\nSIR#2020C0108009, Intake 11/29/19 - CAP approved 1/13/20\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nOctober 29, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 1, 2021\n_______________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
