    "Electronic Bed Check Log for Safehaus Too residents: Bed check\nlogs consistently documented that bed checks were completed in\n15 minutes but lacked variety. For example, bed check\ndocumentation would indicate completion at 12:00 am, 12:15 am,\n12:30 am, 12:45 am, etc. rather than varying intervals.\nAnalysis The agency was found to be in non-compliance with the licensing\nrule.
