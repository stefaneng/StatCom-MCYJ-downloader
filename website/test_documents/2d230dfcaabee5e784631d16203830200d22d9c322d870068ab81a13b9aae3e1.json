Youth C saw staff holding Youth A’s\narms behind her back, while she was face down toward the floor.\nYouth C thought Youth A was pushing her weight to the ground\nand did not believe staff were pushing Youth A down. However,\nshe was watching through her bedroom door and could not be\ncertain.\nStaff 1 was interviewed by phone on 10/23/24 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported that Staff 2 and Staff 3\nassisted with the restraint of Youth A on 10/8/24.

Staff 2 stated Youth A was never in a CPI\nhold, because she was resisting. Staff 2 acknowledged that Youth\nA was on the ground, while staff were holding her arms. Staff 2\nstated CPI requires staff to release youth when they are on the\nground. Staff 2 stated they would have released Youth A in a\nperfect scenario, but this situation was not one. Staff 2 again\nstated this was not a CPI hold, as Youth A was laying on the\nground and her arms were held, without pressure. Staff 2 stated\nthat after Youth A went to the ground, they could not release her,\nbecause she grabbed Staff 1’s leg and would have grabbed\nanother if her other hand was free. Throughout the hold, staff told\nYouth A she could be released once she let go of staff’s leg. Staff\n6",

Youth A dropped her weight and began hitting her\nforehead on the floor. Another staff placed a pillow on the floor to\nprotect Youth A. Staff continued to hold Youth A’s arms behind\nher back, while she was face down on the floor. Staff were not\nusing pressure, but also could not let go, because Youth A was\naggressive.

Staff moved the\npillow under her head. Youth A was yelling, swearing, and making\nthreats. Staff 3 stated they were not using pressure in the hold,\ndespite Youth A trying to hit, kick and bite. When Youth A was\nreleased, Staff 3 tried to exit the wing, but Youth A went after him.\nAdditional staff stood between them and Staff 3 left.\nStaff 3 verified that he completed CPI training. When asked why\nstaff did not let go of Youth A when she was on the floor, Staff 3\nstated it was not a restraint. Staff 3 stated that holding a youth’s\nwrists is not considered restraint and therefore CPI did not need to\nbe followed. When asked if he was aware prone restraint was not\nallowed, Staff 3 stated it was not a restraint as Youth A put herself\non the ground and they were holding her wrists without pressure\nor restricting movement. Staff 3 was informed this was considered\na restraint.\nStaff 4 was interviewed by phone on 10/30/24 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Worker.

Staff intervened and Staff 3 was able to leave the unit. Staff\n4 stated she completed CPI training and believed the holds to be\ncorrect from what she observed and did not hear the Supervisor\n(Staff 3), or Therapist (Staff 5) correct anyone. When asked how\nstaff should respond to a youth on the ground, Staff 4 stated that\nstaff will release once the youth is calm. Staff 4 was informed that\nCPI requires staff to release a youth that has gone down to the\nground.\nAttempts were made to interview Staff 5 on 10/23/24 10/30/24,\n11/4/24.

Staff 5 placed a towel under Youth A’s face.\nStaff 4 then placed a pillow under Youth A’s face.

    "Youth A began hitting her head on the floor; staff put a\npillow under her head. Once calm, the CPI hold was\nreleased. Staff 3 left the area due to being the target of the\nyouth’s aggression.\nA note from Program Manager on the incident report\nindicated more information was needed in the report.\nHowever, Staff 3 was then placed on leave and ultimately\nterminated, unable to amend the report.\n• Behavior Management policy:\no (Page 1) The safe use of physical intervention,\nincluding the ability to recognize and respond to\nsigns of physical distress in clients who are in\nphysical intervention or who are being placed in\nphysical intervention.\no (Page 4) Staff are only permitted to utilize approved\nbehavior management techniques as taught by a\ncertified Crisis Prevention Institute trainer.\n• Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) training manual for the low-\nlevel Team Control Position indicates: Staff face the same\ndirection as the youth, maintain close body contact. Staff\nkeep their inside legs in front of the individual. Staff bring\nthe youth’s arms across their bodies, securing them to their\nhip area. Place the hands closest to the individual’s\nshoulders in a C-shape position to direct the shoulders\nforward.\n• Human Resources files were reviewed. All staff were up to\ndate on Crisis Prevention Institute training. Three of the five\nstaff had previous disciplinary action:\no Staff 1 received verbal warnings in February and\nAugust 2024 for attendance. Staff 1 was placed on a\nfinal warning as a result of the 10/8/24 incident.\no Staff 2 received a verbal warning in September 2022\nfor attendance. Staff 2 was placed on a final warning\nas a result of the 10/8/24 incident.\no Staff 3 was previously suspended for violating\nagency policy in June 2020. Staff 3 received a final\nwarning in March 2023 for violating agency policy.\nStaff 3 was terminated as a result of the 10/8/24\nincident.\nAnalysis A violation was found due to staff physically managing a youth\noutside of the requirements of CPI. In the video, Staff 5 was\nobserved to pull on Youth A’s arm in an attempt to keep her away\nfrom Staff 3. Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3 were observed to place\nYouth A in an incorrect CPI hold, with her arms held high behind\nher back, with her body face down on the floor. In two of the four\n10",
    "restraints, staff did not release the youth from this hold once she\nwas in a prone position on the floor. In addition, Staff 4 placed a\npillow under Youth A’s face in an attempt to keep her from\nbanging her head. Staff 4 did not consider the danger of Youth A\nbeing face down on the floor with a pillow blocking her face.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff qualifications\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff failed to intervene and correct staff while observing an\nimproper restraint.\nInvestigation Staff 5 has been with the facility since 2008. Staff 5 is a therapist\nand trainer for the new behavior management program the agency\nstarted implementing, Safety Care. Staff 5 was certified in Safety\nCare on 3/27/24. In addition, Staff 5 was trained in CPI, including\nthe most recent refresher training on 11/14/23.\nStaff 5 observed for approximately seven minutes as Staff 1, Staff\n2 and Staff 3 held Youth A in three improper, prone, restraints.\nStaff 5 did not intervene to correct or request staff to stop the\nimproper technique. Staff 5 watched as Staff 4 placed a pillow on\nthe floor, under Youth A’s face, three times, without intervening.\nDuring interviews with Staff 2 and Staff 3, staff stated they did not\nbelieve the physical management of Youth A was a restraint, as\nthey did not follow CPI or use pressure. Both staff have been\ntrained in CPI. Both staff, especially a supervisor (Staff 3), should\nhave been aware their actions were indeed a restraint.\nAnalysis A violation was found as Staff 5 is a seasoned, CPI and Safety\nCare trained employee, who failed to intervene while a youth was\nrestrained in an improper and dangerous manner.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was advised that the definition of a restraint needs to\nbe reviewed with staff, as some staff seemed to need clarification.\n11",
