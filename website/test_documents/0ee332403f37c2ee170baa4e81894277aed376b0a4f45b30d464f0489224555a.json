It was reported\nYouth A was bouncing a basketball in the hallway. Staff 1 directed\nYouth A to stop. Youth A ignored Staff 1. Staff 1 physically\nassaulted Youth A by punching him, grabbing him, and pushing\nhim up against a door. Staff 1 put Youth A in a head lock. They\nwere separated by another staff and Staff 1 was sent home\nimmediately. Youth A had an injury to his face near his mouth and\nthe right side of his chin. Youth A refused a medical clearance\nfrom the facility nurse.\nInterviews:\nFormer Chief Administrator sent a notification email to DCWL\non 12/22/24 regarding the incident. Former Chief Administrator\nreported they reviewed video of the incident and immediately sent\nStaff 1 home on administrative leave. Staff 1’s termination was\npending. The incident was reported to MDHHS and law\nenforcement. Youth A had some scrapes on his chin and a cut on\nhis lip. Youth A refused a medical evaluation.\nMDHHS Worker sent an email to DCWL and reported Youth A\nwas observed on 12/23/34 and photos were taken of his injuries.\nAttempts to interview Staff 1 by phone occurred on 12/30/24,\n1/15/25, and 1/27/25. Staff 1 did not return any calls. Staff 1’s\nemployment was terminated on 1/2/25.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/30/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 was present during the\n2",
    "incident and observed Youth A bouncing a basketball in the\nhallway. Staff 2 asked Youth A to stop, but he did not listen. Youth\nA continued bouncing the ball off the floor, walls, and windows.\nStaff 2 asked again and explained he could break something with\nthe ball. Staff 1 was sitting by Youth B’s door and observed Staff 2\nmaking multiple requests to stop bouncing the ball. Staff 1 then\nswiped the ball from Youth A. Staff 2 stated it was a little fuzzy\nabout what happened next, as some other staff and youth could\nbe heard coming up the stairs. Staff 2 recalled hearing Youth A\nswear at and push Staff 1. Staff 2 observed Youth A and Staff 1\nbecome entangled. Staff 2 approached them and observed Staff\n1’s arm around Youth A’s neck. Staff 2 tried to pry them apart,\nwhile telling them to stop. Staff 2 could not pull them apart and\ncalled for a supervisor. Staff 1, Staff 2, Youth A, and Youth B were\nthe only people present at that time. When the two separated,\nYouth A had blood on his face. Staff 1 stated he thought his\nbracelet hit Youth A’s face in the struggle. Staff 2 did not witness\nany punches. Staff 2 verified Staff 1 did not use proper Crisis\nPrevention Institute (CPI) techniques. Staff 2 recalled Staff 1 was\nthe one-to-one staff for Youth B. Staff 2 was unsure why Staff 1\ninterjected himself in the situation and wished he would have let\nStaff 2 handle it.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/30/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported when she\narrived on the floor Staff 1 already had Youth A in a hold. It was\nnot a regular CPI hold as staff were trained to use. In addition,\nstaff were not allowed to do one person holds and always had to\ncall for assistance if a hold was necessary. Staff 1 had his arms\nover Youth A’s shoulder while holding him. Staff 3 could not recall\nexactly what else Staff 1 was doing. Youth A was yelling that he\nwas going to attack Staff 1 when he was let go. Staff 3 called for a\nsupervisor. Staff 1 then let go of Youth A. Youth A had some\nblood on his face, although she was unsure where it was coming\nfrom. Staff 3 recalled Youth A was breathing and talking normally\nwhile in the hold.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/30/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 reported they arrived\non the floor and observed Staff 1 holding Youth A in a headlock.\nThe hold was not a proper CPI technique. Staff 4 initially thought\nStaff 1 was breaking up a fight. However, it became apparent that\nwas not the case as Youth B said Staff 1 punched Youth A,\nslammed him, and put him in a headlock. Staff 1 later said he told\nYouth A to go to his room and his bracelet hit Youth A on the lip.\nStaff 4 stated that story did not make sense. Staff 1 was the one-\n3",
    "to-one staff for Youth B that day. It did not make sense for him to\nbe involved in a situation with Youth A. Staff 4 observed Youth A\nto have a “busted lip”, blood on his face, and some marks on his\nneck.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/30/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth A stated on 12/22/24\nhe was upstairs bouncing a ball. Staff 2 asked him to stop. Staff 1\nyelled at Youth A to stop bouncing the ball. Staff 1 then slapped\nthe ball away. Youth A pushed Staff 1. Staff 1 punched Youth A\ninto the face. They began fighting and Youth A was hit in the lip.\nStaff 1 had his hands around Youth A’s neck. Youth A could not\nbreathe for a few seconds, then Staff 1 let go. Staff 1 held Youth A\nfor less than a minute. Youth A was aware Staff 1 was not\nfollowing policy. Youth A reported he felt safe at the facility with\nStaff 1 gone.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/30/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth B indicated he did not\nrecall anything and refused to be interviewed any further.\nContact occurred with MDHHS Worker on 1/9/25 and 1/28/25.\nMDHHS Worker reported that a Kids Talk interview was\nscheduled for Youth A. However, it never occurred as Youth A\nwas moved from the facility and his new placement had not\nresponded to requests to reschedule. MDHHS Worker also\nreported she attempted to contact the assigned Detroit Police\nDepartment Detective for an update on any criminal charges.\nHowever, she had not received a response.\nVideo review:\nYouth A was walking down the hallway, bouncing a basketball.\nStaff 1 stood from his chair and approached Youth A. Staff 1\nknocked the ball away from Youth A. Staff 1 pushed on Youth A’s\nface and shoulder. Youth A attempted to walk away. Staff 1\ncontinued to follow Youth A as Youth A turned and pushed Staff 1.\nStaff 1 then pushed Youth A into the wall, then into a door. Staff 2\nran down the hallway to intervene. Although the view was partially\nobstructed by a pipe in the ceiling, Staff 1 could be seen standing\nand wrestling with Youth A. Staff 2 and Staff 3 tried to pull them\napart. Youth B was standing in the hallway watching. Staff 1, Staff\n2, Staff 3 and Youth A were standing together by the door. Due to\nthe blocked view, it was unclear what occurred. However, Staff 4\nand additional youth entered the unit and walked past the\nsituation. Supervisor also entered the unit at that time and the\n4",
    "group dispersed.

This is only to be used to protect client or\nothers from unanticipated or severely aggressive behavior\nthat places them at serious threat of violence or injury if no\nimmediate intervention occurs.
