She stated she doesn’t have\nany knowledge of Caregiver dating anyone, but this will also be\ndiscussed during the home visit to ensure that clearances are\ncompleted regarding anyone having regular contact with Youth A.\nIdeas were discussed to ensure the agency is aware of all\nindividuals residing in the home. This includes, unannounced\nvisits, interviewing Youth A to inquire who visits the home and/or\nstays the night, and observation of items in the home during home\nvisits such as men’s clothing or belongings.\nFoster Care Worker 1 (FCW1) was interviewed via telephone\non October 30, 2024. She stated she is new to the agency, the\ncase and child welfare overall. She has been assigned since the\nbeginning of September 2024. She stated she has been to the\nhome once for a home visit. During her initial home visit,\nCaregiver indicated her adult son had recently moved out of the\nhome so there should not be anyone else residing there.

Complainant was not able to provide names of paternal\nrelatives Youth A is having contact with.
