INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10177 Resident restraint\nSection (1) The facility shall establish and follow written policy and\nDescription procedures specifying the use of resident restraint.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 05/09/2025 Youth A was improperly restrained and sustained\ninjuries as a result.\nInvestigation The complainant was interviewed over the phone on 05/19/2025\nand had no additional information to offer.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n05/20/2025. Staff 1 recalled being elsewhere in the facility when\nhe saw the incident involving Youth A beginning. Youth A was\nalready being restrained on the ground when he was able to come\nprovide assistance. Staff 1 saw Youth A be released from the first\nrestraint, only to then get up and hit Staff 6 in the face. Staff 1\nassisted after the second restraint and when the mechanical\nrestraints were placed on Youth A. Staff 1 assisted with\ntransporting Youth A to her room. He recalled this being done by\nrolling her on to her mattress and slowly pulling the mattress\ninside of her room. Youth A was picked up by other staff and\nplaced on her bed while still in the mechanical restraints. Staff 1\nand Supervisor 1 sat next to Youth A and restrained her arms as\nthis occurred because Youth A was beginning to escalate\nagain. While Youth A was physically struggling and verbally\naggressive, Staff 1 recalled Youth A stating her handcuffs were on\ntoo tight. Staff 1 recalled training on how to ensure this was not\nthe case, and every time he checked the handcuffs they were not\nplaced on too tightly. He also recalled Youth A trying to pull her\nhands out of the handcuffs. Youth A continuously stated that if the\nmechanical restraints were removed, she would assault\nstaff. Staff 1 recalled Youth A laying on her bed at one point, and\nhe and Supervisor 1 were able to let go of her. This was when\nYouth A threw up on the floor. Staff 1 tried to keep Youth A’s hair\nout of the vomit and she commented that he needed to let go of\nher and she didn’t care about her hair. Staff 1 believed that it took\n2",
    "20 or 30 minutes for he and Supervisor 1 to feel comfortable\ntaking off the mechanical restraints. Youth A was continuing to\nmake comments about assaulting staff but had began to do so\nwith less energy. Staff 1 recalled exiting the room and after the\ndoor closed, Youth A began to yell and hit it. Staff 1 did not recall\nseeing any visible marks or bruises to Youth A, and he did not\nbelieve she had any vomit on her by the time they left the\nroom. He recalled some redness to Youth A’s nose, and he\nbelieved this was caused by her slamming her own head on the\nground during the first part of the restraint.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 05/20/2025 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He\nrecalled being involved in the restraint of Youth A from the\nbeginning of the incident. Youth A began to get upset with Staff 2\nand Staff 6 after she lost points through the facility’s behavioral\nmanagement program. Youth A began to kick and hit the unit\ndoor, and then began to attempt to make an outgoing phone\ncall. Staff 2 recalled attempting to verbally redirect Youth A. As\nshe would make the outgoing phone call, Staff 6 stood nearby and\nhung up the phone each time Youth A attempted to do so and\nexplained to her why she could not make a phone call at that\ntime. This occurred several times. Youth A began to get\nphysically assaultive with Staff 6. Staff 2 and Staff 6\ncommunicated that they were going to attempt to restraint Youth A\nat that time. Staff 2 and Staff 6 took a hold of one of Youth A’s\narms and attempted a standing restraint of Youth A. As this\noccurred, Staff 2 recalled seeing Supervisor 1 and Supervisor 2\ncome in. As the standing restraint occurred Youth A began to\nfight back against Staff 2. Staff 2 recalled Youth A dropping her\nweight and going to the ground. Youth A was then laying in a\nprone position on her stomach, and Staff 2 and Staff 6 both\nattempted to continue to restrain her because she had continued\nto be verbally and physically aggressive. Staff 2 described this as\nYouth A squirming, kicking, biting and spitting. Staff 2 recalled\nsomeone, he could not remember which specific staff, attempting\nto restrain Youth A’s legs as well. Eventually Staff 2 switched out\nand moved to try to contain Youth A’s legs. Staff 2 reported never\nmaking contact with Youth A’s neck or head at any point during\nthe restraint. He saw Youth A attempting to hit her own head on\nthe carpet as the restraint was occurring. Staff 2 recalled Youth A\ncalming down enough to have the restraint end, but then Youth A\nproceeded to get up quickly and hit Staff 6. Another restraint\noccurred. Staff 2 stated mechanical restraints had to be used in\norder to help de-escalate Youth A. Staff 2 believed it was\nsupervisors who then decided to use a mattress from Youth A’s\n3",
    "room to help move her to her room. As this was getting set up\nStaff 2 recalled seeing Supervisor 2 rubbing Youth A’s back in\nattempt to calm her, but Youth A did not respond in kind. Staff 2\nreminded Youth A that she still had the ability to have the\nhandcuffs removed and go to her room on her own, but she only\nresponded with continued verbal aggression. Staff 2 recalled\nYouth A being placed gently on the mattress and then being slid to\nher room. When Youth A was in her bedroom she was sat up and\nstaff were continuing to try to verbally deescalate her with no\nsuccess. When she sat up Youth A continued to try to kick and\nspit at any staff near her. Staff 2 recalled telling her that he was\ngoing to try to restrain her legs to prevent injuring herself or\nanyone else. Eventually staff were able to remove the handcuffs\nand attempt to leave the room quickly. After her door was shut\nYouth A kicked and pounded on the door, threatening and\nswearing towards staff. Staff 2 stated he never saw any staff\nplace any of their weight on Youth A’s back or neck, or do\nanything that would have affected Youth A’s breathing. Staff 2\nbelieved Youth A was verbally aggressive and threatening for a\nmajority of the incident. Staff 2 saw some injuries to Youth A,\nspecifically “carpet burn” on her nose and possibly a little bit of\nblood. Staff 2 confirmed seeing Youth A vomit twice during the\nrestraint incident. The first time occurred after the initiation of the\nrestraint while out in the unit. Staff 2 believed this occurred\nbecause Youth A was significantly verbally escalated. The vomit\noccurred on the counter near the phone, and Youth A went to the\nground shortly thereafter. Staff 2 denied ever seeing any vomit on\nYouth A at that time. The second occurrence was when Youth A\nwas in her room. Staff 2 recalled seeing a small amount of vomit\non the floor in front of Youth A’s toilet. Staff 2 did not see any\nvomit on Youth A at that time as well. Staff 2 recalled bringing\nYouth A some cleaning supplies about an hour or so later, when\nshe had calmed down enough that he felt safe opening the\ndoorway. Youth A was able to clean her room at that time. Staff 2\nalso recalled working the following morning. Youth A slept in and\nhe did not have much contact with her other than performing eyes\non checks.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed on 05/20/2025 with DHHS Worker\n1 during an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He\nrecalled involving himself in the incident when Youth A made\nphysical contact with staff. As he came in the unit Staff 2 and\nStaff 6 were attempting to restrain Youth A. He recalled\nwitnessing them using the MACH 2 standing hold with Youth\nA. He believed Youth A “dead-legged” and fell to the\nground. Supervisor 1 recalled seeing Staff 2 and Staff 6 attempt a\n4",
    "ground hold of Youth A at that time. Youth A was on her stomach,\nbut commented staff were trained in this restraint hold. Supervisor\n1 did not believe anyone had any weight on Youth A’s chest or\nback. Supervisor 1 attempted to help with the restraint while\nYouth A was on the ground. As he did, he recalled Youth A\nkicking, screaming and attempting to pull her hands\nfree. Supervisor 1 believed Youth A had free movement of her\nhead and neck. He referred to seeing her spit and attempt to bite\nstaff during the restraint, as well as slamming her head on the\nground. He recalled seeing Supervisor 2 offer a blanket to help\nYouth A not gain any injuries to her face or head. At some point\nduring the restraint, Supervisor 1 left and performed room checks\nof other youth. He then went to the control room to continue to\nmonitor the situation. Supervisor 1 recalled coming back in the\nroom to continue to assist when the restraint had ended. At that\npoint Youth A was still laying on the ground. Supervisor 1 recalled\nYouth A asking for a drink of water, and when a cup was offered\nto her, she slapped it away. Not long after Youth A got up, she hit\nStaff 6. Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 initiated another\nrestraint. Supervisor 1 recalled this restraint moving to the ground\nin a similar manner to the first restraint. He could not recall how\nlong it took, but Supervisor 1 confirmed mechanical restraints\nwere used on Youth A because of her continued fighting back for\nan extended period of time. Youth A was transported to her room\non her bedroom mattress, laying on it while in\nhandcuffs. Supervisor 1 recalled Youth A pausing her aggressive\nbehavior as this occurred. When she was sat up in her room, she\nbegan to kick and scream at himself and Staff 1 again. Supervisor\n1 performed a sitting MACH 2 restraint with Staff 1. Youth A\ncontinued to attempt to headbutt and kick at Supervisor 1 and\nStaff 1. Supervisor 1 reported moving Youth A to a prone position\non her bed slab as she rolled herself over from a sitting\nposition. Supervisor 1 believed the restraint holds were\nsuccessful and did not require much force despite Youth A’s\nconsistent fighting back. As Youth A continued to headbutt, spit\nand bite at himself and Staff 1. Supervisor 1 noticed she vomited a\nsmall amount on the floor near her bed. He recalled telling her\nthat they would “scooch” her away from it, and he did not notice\nany on her face. Supervisor 1 recalled not being concerned about\nher breathing at that point because she continued to yell at\nthem. Supervisor 1 believed it took about another 30 minutes for\nYouth A to cease fighting and threatening staff. Supervisor 1 went\nto remove the handcuffs after explaining to Youth A what they\nwere going to do. As this occurred, Youth A began to resist and\nfight back. Supervisor 1 decide to remove the mechanical\nrestraints because of the length of time the entire situation had\n5",
    "occurred. As Staff 1 came out of the room to leave Youth A in\nalone, she charged at the door. Supervisor 1 recalled the door\nclosed before it created a safety issue with Youth A running\ntoward it. Youth A began to kick at the door and scream at\nstaff. Supervisor 1 recalled Staff 2 came back some time later\nwith cleaning supplies for Youth A to clean her room. Supervisor\n1 also worked the next morning and noted Youth A slept in well\npast the morning. Supervisor 1 recalled seeing small abrasions\non Youth A’s nose, which he attributed to her slamming her head\non the carpet during the restraint. Youth A did not comment on\nany injuries or pain.\nStaff 3 was interviewed on 05/20/2025 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He was\noutside with a different unit when the incident began. He took the\nother unit inside to their separate unit and ensured staff coverage\nso that he could assist with Youth A. He saw other Staff 6\nspeaking with Youth A, who was visibly upset. He saw Staff 2 and\nStaff 6 initiate a restraint. He entered the unit to assist. As he\napproached, he saw Youth A go to the ground and Staff 2 and\nStaff 6 follow her and restrain her on the ground. Youth A\nattempted to kick, bite and spit at staff, and was verbally\naggressive and threatening. Staff 3 attempted to secure Youth\nA’s legs as she kicked. Staff 3 recalled Staff 4 attempted to use\nblankets to help limit Youth A’s ability to hit her own head on the\nfloor. He reported Supervisor 2 provided coaching and support\nduring the situation. Staff 3 released Youth A from the\nrestraint. As this occurred, Supervisor 2 got Youth A a glass of\nwater she requested. Youth A slapped the water away and got\nup. Youth A immediately hit Staff 6. Staff 3 attempted to restrain\nYouth A again with Supervisor 1. Youth A dropped her weight and\nwent to the ground, laying in a prone position. Staff 3 recalled this\nrestraint took a long time. Staff 3 was spit on multiple times by\nYouth A. Youth A was eventually placed in shackles because of\nher continued fighting and threats to staff. She was transported to\nher room on a mattress. Staff 3 believed he saw spit or vomit that\ncame from Youth A during the restraint but denied that it was ever\non her face or that her face was near where it was located. Staff 3\ndenied himself or any other staff ever having any contact with\nYouth A’s head or neck during any part of the restraint. He did not\nbelieve anyone had their weight on Youth A’s back or that her\nbreathing was restricted in any way.\nStaff 4 was interviewed on 05/20/2025 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She\nrecalled seeing the incident begin while watching from the control\n6",
    "room. Staff 4 came to the situation as Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 6\nwere attempting to restraint Youth A. She took responsibility for\nclearing Youth A’s room ahead of a possible room\nconfinement. She attempted to help with the restraint by holding\nYouth A’s legs. Youth A had dropped her weight and was in a\nprone position on the floor. Staff 4 did not recall seeing anyone\nplace their weight on Youth A in any way that would have caused\nbruising or restricted her breathing. She saw Youth A hit her head\non the carpet on her own accord several times during the\nrestraint. Youth A was continuously verbally aggressive during\nthe restraint. Staff 4 was able to release Youth A’s legs and Staff\n2, Staff 3 and Supervisor 2 ended the floor restraint, only for Youth\nA to get up and hit Staff 6 in the face. Staff 4 did not participate in\nthe next restraint after this occurred but was still present in the\nsituation. She recalled Youth A hitting her head on the carpet and\nSupervisor 2 provided a blanket to help protect Youth A’s\nhead. Staff 4 recalled hearing Youth A state that she couldn’t\nbreathe with the blanket under her head, so it was\nremoved. When Youth A was moved to her bedroom, Staff 4 took\non other tasks while other staff still worked with Youth A. Staff 4\nreiterated she never saw other staff in a position that would have\ncaused bruising or restrictions to Youth A’s breathing, but noted\nYouth A was consistently fighting back against the staff’s\nholds. Staff 4 recalled seeing Youth A spit blood at one point, and\nshe believed this occurred from Youth A’s aggressive head\nmovements while on the ground. Staff 4 did not see Youth A\nvomit at any point, but noted in past incidents Youth A became\nverbally escalated to the point of stressing her body.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed on 05/20/2025 with DHHS Worker\n1 during an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She\nrecalled hearing screaming from Youth A from inside the unit,\nincluding her demanding to speak with a supervisor. Supervisor 2\nintentionally did not enter because she did not want to step on the\ntoes of the staff that were already trying to reason with and\nverbally de-escalate Youth A. When Youth A began to get\nphysically assaultive towards Staff 2 and Staff 6 involved,\nSupervisor 2 came in the unit. She saw Staff 2 and Staff 6\nattempt a standing restraint and escort of Youth A to her room\nwhen Youth A “dead legged” and dropped to the ground. While\nStaff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 6 involved restrained Youth A on the\nground, Supervisor 2 stood by and provided coaching and\ndirection to the staff. She saw Youth A struggling and fighting\nback against staff. Supervisor 2 grabbed handcuffs and leg\nshackles in case they would be needed because the restraint\nattempts were not successful. Supervisor 2 saw Staff 4\n7",
    "attempting to assist Youth A in preventing her from hitting her own\nhead on the floor. Supervisor 2 eventually took over for Staff\n4. Eventually Youth A was calm where Supervisor 2 instructed\nstaff to slowly release her. When the restraint was ended Youth A\nstayed on the floor, and began to verbally escalate again. She\nwas making demands, including asking for water. When water\nwas provided to her, Youth A slapped it away. Supervisor 2\nstated she checked on the other youth in the unit when Staff 6\nwas hit in the face by Youth A. She was not directly involved in\nthe 2nd restraint that was initiated on the ground. Supervisor 2\ndecided the use of mechanical restraints was necessary. These\nwere applied and it took time for Youth A to calm\ndown. Supervisor 2 recalled swapping out of the restraint to\nattend to Staff 6, who was injured from the hit by Youth A and had\nto go to the hospital. Supervisor 2 recalled coming back to the\nfacility and Youth A was in a room confinement. Youth A was still\nescalated. Supervisor 2 saw a small amount of vomit on the floor\nof Youth A’s room. She did not believe this was harming Youth A\nand did not believe there was any vomit on Youth A’s\nperson. Supervisor 2 believed that the restraint attempts were\nperformed as close to what is trained as possible considering\nYouth A’s escalated state. She denied nor did she see any staff\nhave their weight on Youth A that would have caused any injury or\nbruising.\nStaff 5 was interviewed on 05/20/2025 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 5\nwas not involved in the restraints themselves, but spoke with\nYouth A following the incident. Youth A was still escalated. Staff\n5 saw vomit on the floor between Youth A’s bed and toilet. She\ndenied seeing any on Youth A’s face or clothes. Staff 5\ncommunicated the vomit could be cleaned up as soon as Youth A\nwas able to de-escalate to the point that staff felt safe opening her\ndoor. Staff 5 did not see any noticeable bruising on Youth A,\nother than some redness on her face. Staff 5 did not hear Youth\nA remark on any pain or injuries. Staff 5 confirmed she assisted\nYouth A in showering either the day after the incident or the\nfollowing day. When Youth A took that shower there were no\nbehavioral concerns and Youth A did not comment on the restraint\nincident at all.\nStaff 6 was interviewed on 05/20/2025 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 6\nreported she was involved in the incident from the start. Youth A\nwas upset because she wasn’t allowed a pencil due to earlier\nbehavioral and safety concerns. Youth A began to verbally\n8",
    "escalate, directing that specifically at Staff 6. Youth A was\ndirected to go to her room, which she briefly did willingly only to\nthen go to the doors of the unit and begin kicking and\nscreaming. Staff 6 attempted to verbally de-escalate Youth A with\nno success. She recalled Youth A throwing a chair at one of the\ndoors. Youth A attempted to make outgoing phone calls. Staff 6\nexplained that could not occur because of her behavior, but Youth\nA did not stop. As Youth A continued to try to call out, Staff 6\nreached over and hung up the phone. Youth A began to get more\nphysical and escalate verbally. Youth A was physically assaultive,\nso Staff 6 felt it was necessary to attempt to restrain her. Staff 6\nand Staff 2 attempted to implement a standing restraint of Youth\nA. Staff 6 believed Staff 2 was not fully trained in the restraint\nmodel at that time, but believed he did the best he could. When\nthe restraint was initiated, Youth A was bent over at the waist\nslightly over the countertop. Staff 6 could not recall if Youth A\nvomited. She recalled past incidents where Youth A was so\nescalated from screaming that she would have small amounts of\nvomit come up. Youth A began to fight back immediately and\nquickly dropped her weight to the ground. Staff 6 attempted to\nhave Youth A lay comfortably on her stomach while still controlling\nher arms from hitting back. Staff 6 recalled Youth A kicking, trying\nto pull her arms away and attempting to grab Staff 6’s keys. She\nrecalled Youth A continuing to verbally escalate, including yelling\nthat staff should not let her go because she was going to get up\nand hit them. Staff 6 saw Youth A hitting her head on the carpet\nrepeatedly. Youth A was tried to bite anyone who came near her\nhead. Staff 6 denied ever seeing any staff put their weight on\nYouth A’s back or neck or do anything that could have restricted\nher breathing. Staff 6 recalled trying to rub Youth A’s back in an\nattempt to help calm her and Youth A yelled back to “stop\ntouching by fucking back.” Supervisor 2 instructed staff to end the\nrestraint because Youth A had calmed down. As all the staff\nstood up, Youth A remained laying on the ground. She then began\nto verbally escalate again. Youth A suddenly stood up and hit\nStaff 6 in the face. Staff 6 stated she did not expect this and it\nhappened quickly enough that she could not brace herself. She\nstumbled backward and lost her glasses. Staff 6 recalled\nregaining her bearings and saw Youth A being restrained on the\nground. Staff 6 recalled Supervisor 1 asking her to leave the\nunit. Staff 6 left the unit and eventually went to the hospital. She\ndid not see how the incident resolved itself nor worked with Youth\nA in the following days.\nStaff 7 was interviewed on 05/20/2025 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He\n9",
    "recalled witnessing the incident from the control room for its\nentirety. Staff 7 was able to see through the windows into the unit,\nwatch the incident on the facility security cameras as well as listen\nthrough the communication system. He recalled a significant\namount of disobedience and verbal aggression from Youth\nA. Staff 7 believed the restraint attempt could have occurred\nearlier, but Staff 6 was trying a significant amount of verbal de-\nescalation. He saw both restraints but could not see specific\nholds or positions of staff. He felt like he could see Youth A\nfighting back during most of the restraint attempts.\nYouth B and Youth C were interviewed separately on 06/04/2025\nwith DHHS Worker 1 during an announced, face-to-face visit to\nthe facility. Both youth did not see much of the incident because\nthey followed facility rules and were in their rooms when it\noccurred. They both had similar recollections of hearing a\nsignificant amount of screaming, threatening and crying from\nYouth A as it occurred.\nYouth A was interviewed over the phone in the presence of her\nmother on 06/23/2025. Youth A remembered initially getting upset\nbecause Staff 6 had unfairly taken points away from her. She\nremembered getting restrained initially but did not understand\nwhy. Youth A felt like it came out of nowhere and no one\nexplained what was going to occur. Youth A recalled falling to the\nground and fighting back against staff. She could not recall\nexactly which staff had their hands on her at this point. She felt\nlike the staff involved were putting their knees into her shoulders\nto hold her down. Youth A denied that anyone touched her head\nor neck. She told the staff involved she could not breathe during\nparts of the restraint. A staff that she could not name responded\nto her that the restraint could be ended if she got up and went to\nher room. Youth A recalled the first part of the restraint ending,\nand she got up to make a phone call. A staff member that she\ncould not recall tried to stop her, so Youth A slapped her. Youth A\nstated being restrained again in a similar manner to the first\nrestraint. She confirmed she continued to fight back against this\nrestraint. Youth A recalled being transported to her room. She\nremembered throwing up at some point and believed that this was\nin her hair until after the incident ended. Youth A denied the vomit\nin her room being cleaned up, then clarified that she was not able\nto shower until Sunday morning after the late Friday evening\nincident. Youth A denied that she decided not to shower on\nSaturday and believed that she was not offered to shower.\n10",
    "License Designee and Supervisor 2 were interviewed during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility on 07/07/2025. As a\ntrainer for staff at the facility in the chosen restraint model,\nSupervisor 2 clarified the holds staff used during the restraint.\nStaff were trained on MACH holds 1 through 5, and in this incident\nthey attempted to use MACH 1 and MACH 2 holds. Supervisor 2\nexplained these holds could be used in a standing position with a\nyouth as well as in a position where the youth is laying prone on\nthe ground. She stated the difference between MACH 1 and\nMACH 2 holds is the arm positioning of the youth and staff\ninvolved. Supervisor 2 described MACH 2 hold as being initiated\nby facing the opposite direction of the youth, as it is performed the\nstaff are standing on either side of the youth then are facing the\nsame direction. Supervisor 2 described MACH 4 hold as requiring\none staff holding one arm of the youth apiece while the youth is\nlaying prone on the ground. Supervisor 2 stated that the facility’s\nuse of mechanical restraints is not drawn from the MACH restraint\ntraining, but performed per the facility’s polices & procedures.\nVideo reviewed:\n• Security video footage dated 05/09/2025 beginning at 4:36\nPM and ending at 6:03 PM was provided and\nreviewed. Youth A could be seen sitting with Staff 6 at a\ntable and abruptly getting up and going over to her door,\nkicking it while it was closed. She was able to kick the door\nopen and then entered her bedroom. Youth A came out of\nher room and tossed her bed and bedding on to the floor.\nYouth A could be seen talking (moving her mouth) and\ngesturing towards Staff 6. After a few minutes of standing\nat her doorway, Youth A went to the unit doors and began\nkicking and pounding on them. Youth A began to touch the\nphone and appeared to be attempting to make phone\ncall. Multiple attempts were made with Staff 6 standing\nnearby, reaching over to hang up the phone each\ntime.

Youth A continued to lay on the ground in a prone\nposition and was seen moving her head\nintermittently.

    "necessary job responsibilities and was trained in the\nfacility restraint model.\no Supervisor 2 did not have any discipline noted in her\nfile and was trained as a trainer in the facility\nrestraint model.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviewed, documentation reviewed, and video reviewed the\nfacility did not follow written policy and procedures regarding\nresident restraint. Staff involved utilized methods of restraint and\nescorting of Youth A that were not approved techniques per the\nMACH restraint model as staff were seen using more staff than\nrequired for both the standing and floor restraints, staff sitting and\nlying on Youth A’s legs during the floor restraint and staff carrying\nYouth A on a mattress while mechanically restrained.\nAdditionally, the facility’s written policy and procedures regarding\nresident restraint lack clarity on what methods are being utilized\nfrom MACH. Facility policy allows staff that are not trained in\nMACH to physically intervene with youth, that can lead to unsafe\nphysical management of youth and is in direct conflict with Rule\n400.10125.\nThe agency was in compliance with affording Youth A the\nopportunity to clean her room and shower afterward the incident.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR # 2024SIC0001535 dated 9/13/2024, CAP approved 11/1/2024\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n07/14/2025\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 15, 2025\n___________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n17"
