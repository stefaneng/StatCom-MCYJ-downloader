Youth A stated he was with the\ngroup when they went to a beach outing recently. He initially\nstated he was not sure which staff were working that day, but then\nremembered Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3. Youth A stated Youth B\naccused him of touching her inappropriately while at the beach.\nHe stated he was confused by this and never touched her. Youth\nA stated Staff 1 and Staff 2 were present and witnessed Youth B\nstating this. He believed Staff 1 and Staff 2 “kind of” did not\nbelieve him. He recalled Staff 1 telling him to stay away from\nYouth B the rest of the day as well as similar instructions once the\nyouth returned to the program. Youth A stated Youth B was no\nlonger placed at the facility so it’s not a problem anymore.\nDHHS Foster Care worker 1 was interviewed over a video\nconference on 08/18/2023. She stated she had recently visited\nYouth A at the facility and Youth A had stated he did in fact touch\nYouth B but had lied about it previously to staff.\nYouth B was interviewed on 08/28/2023 over the phone. She\nconfirmed she is now at a new placement. Youth B stated while at\nthe old placement, she was at a beach with the unit and was\nswimming. Youth B stated Youth A touched her under the water in\nher private area. She stated this happened maybe 10 feet out\nfrom the beach. She also recalled Youth A asked her to kiss him.\nYouth B recalled Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 were at the beach.\nShe stated Staff 1 and Staff 2 were sitting at a table near the\nwater and were able to see the incident. Youth B recalled Youth C\nwitnessed this and swam back to tell the staff. Youth B stated\nStaff 1 noticed what had occurred and started addressing it right\naway. Youth B stated Staff 1 had asked Youth A to stay away\nfrom her for the rest of the day, and she did not recall there being\nany issue with this instruction. She also stated upon return to the\nunit from the beach outing, she talked with Staff 4 and\nAdministrator 1. She stated Administrator 1 would not listen to her\nand Administrator 1 said “no, no, go away, I don’t want to hear it.”\nYouth B believed Staff 4 was handling the situation well because\n2",
    "Staff 4 was advocating for Youth B’s needs after being touched\ninappropriately. Youth B denied ever saying she stated she was\ngoing to allege Youth A touched her.\nStaff 4 was interviewed over the phone on 08/29/2023. Staff 4\nrecalled the incident where Youth A allegedly touched Youth B on\nan outing to the beach. She stated she was not working the day of\nthe incident but was involved afterwards. Staff 4 recalled talking to\nAdministrator 1 about the situation. Staff 4 recalled Administrator 1\ntelling her not to complete an “accusation form” because\nAdministrator 1 had heard Youth A tell Youth B that he would\naccuse her of bad things if she did not play with him. Staff 4 stated\nshe spoke with Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 1 and Staff 2 said they did\nnot hear the same thing come from Youth A prior to the incident.\nStaff 4 recalled Administrator 1 telling her to “leave it alone, don’t\nworry about it” and Administrator 1 would take care of it.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 09/12/2023. He recalled the incident\nwhere Youth A had allegedly touched Youth B during a beach\nouting a few weeks earlier. Staff 1 recalled Youth A and Youth B\nstruggling to get along before they even went to the beach that\nday. He recalled hearing Youth B say “I’m going to say that he\ntouched me if he doesn’t leave me alone” before they even left.\nStaff 1 stated he was walking back from the snack stand when he\nheard Youth B state Youth A touched her. He recalled asking her\nif something actually happened and she said “no”. As a\nprecaution, Staff 1 stated he and Staff 2 ensured Youth A stayed\naway from Youth B for the rest of the outing and the safety plan\nextended to the rest of their time placed together before Youth B\nmoved. Staff 1 recalled Youth A denied this accusation in the\nmoment. Staff 1 reported the incident to Administrator 1 upon his\nreturn and wrote an incident report.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 09/12/2023. He recalled Youth B said\nshe was upset at Youth A as they left the home to go to the beach\nouting. He recalled hearing Youth B state “if he doesn’t leave me\nalone, I’m gonna say he touched me” while in the water with Youth\nA no more than 10 or 15 feet away from where he and Staff 1 had\nbeen located. Staff 2 stated he and Staff 1 advised both of the\nyouth to stay away from each other in that moment. Staff 2\nrecalled talking to Administrator 1 once they returned to the facility\nand he wrote an incident report.\nYouth C was interviewed on 09/12/2023 during an announced\nface-to-face visit at the facility. She stated she recalled the\nincident where Youth A touched Youth B during a beach outing.\n3",
    "She stated she was standing right where the water came up to the\nbeach and was talking to Staff 1 when she saw Youth A and\nYouth B both go under the water just a few feet away. She\nbelieved Youth A put his hand out and touched Youth B in the\ncrotch area. Youth C stated she told Staff 1 immediately what she\nsaw. Youth C recalled Youth B standing up and stating Youth A\nwas making her feel uncomfortable and he touched her. Youth C\nrecalled Youth A denying this at that moment. Youth C clarified\nshe did not think she told any of the staff present directly what she\nsaw but was a side part of the conversation. Youth C recalled\nseeing Staff 1 and Staff 2 talk to Youth A and Youth B individually\nimmediately afterwards. She also recalled hearing Youth A and\nYouth B are not supposed to be near each other once they came\nback to the unit.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed over a video call and\n09/13/2023. Administrator 1 recalled talking to everyone that was\nallegedly involved in the incident at the beach and “in her opinion”\nYouth B‘s recollection of what occurred involved too much\ninconsistency. Administrator 1 stated Staff 1 informed her Youth B\nhad been stating prior to this happening she was going to allege\nYouth A touched her if he did not leave her alone. Administrator 1\nrecalled instructing Staff 1 and Staff 2 to write incident reports\nabout what had occurred and putting in a safety plan to ensure\nYouth A and Youth B weren’t alone together and were not near\neach other as best as possible. Administrator 1 stated having a\nconversation with DHHS Foster Care worker 1 a couple weeks\nlater. Administrator 1 was not sure if the caseworker DHHS Foster\nCare worker 1 said Youth A admitted touching Youth B after\nDHHS Foster Care worker 1’s conversation with Youth A.\nAdministrator 1 stated staff did not witness any touching between\nYouth A and Youth B and there was legitimate concern Youth B\nhad been stating prior to the incident that she was going to allege\nYouth A touched her. Administrator 1 recalled the incident never\ncame up again after that day. Administrator 1 denied ever stating\nanything to Youth B or Staff 4 to the effect that she did not have\ntime or was not worried about the incident where Youth A\nallegedly touched Youth B at the beach. Administrator 1 stated\nshe never told Youth B she “did not have any time” to speak about\nthe incident and did not recall ever discussing the incident with\nStaff 4 because Staff 4 was not present that day.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• An incident report dated 08/02/2023 authored by Staff 2\nwas provided and reviewed. In this incident report it was\ndescribed that “While at the lake, staff were watching Youth\n4",
    "B and her peer playing. When Youth B got upset with her\npeer and stated she was going to get him in trouble and\nsay he was \"being inappropriate\" with her. Staff observed\nno inappropriate interactions but asked them to remain\nseparated the remainder of the day due to Youth B's\nthreats.” In addition, actions taken were described as\n“Youth B was advised to stay 10 feet away from her peer at\nall times, and that if she continues to feel upset, staff will\nwork with her on practicing coping skills. Youth B later told\nstaff that her peer had done nothing inappropriate with her\nbut she wanted him in trouble.”\nAnalysis Through interviews of youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was no evidence found Youth A and Youth B were\nnot being supervised while at the beach nor did staff fail to\nrespond. Additionally, once staff were notified, they immediately\nseparated the youth and put a plan in place to keep the youth\nseparated. There was not sufficient evidence found to show that\nany staff failed to respond to the alleged incident in an appropriate\nmanner after the fact.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4157 Behavior management.\nSection (2) At a minimum, the behavior management system shall\nDescription include all of the following:\n(b) Positive intervention strategies to assist residents in\ndeveloping improved problem solving, self-management,\nand social skills.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff members have not used positive language or methods to\nrespond to behaviors of youth.\nInvestigation Incident 1\nYouth B was interviewed on 08/28/2023 over the phone. Youth B\nrecalled an incident where she was escalated outside the building\nas nighttime began to fall. She stated Staff 5 and Administrator 1\nwere involved and said there was a “monster in the woods” in\norder to try to get her to come back inside. Youth B stated she\nwas very scared at the moment. She recalled Administrator 1\nsaying “if you don’t come inside, the man with a machete might be\nout there and might get you.” Youth B referenced a news story\nthat aired the same day of a man in the surrounding area that had\nattempted to murder homeless people with the use of a machete.\nYouth B recalled wanting to talk to Staff 4 who was inside the\nbuilding, and Administrator 1 told Staff 4 to stay inside.\n5",
    "Staff 4 was interviewed over the phone on 08/29/2023. Staff 4\nrecalled Youth B struggled to sleep and was afraid of someone\nattacking her in the night. Staff 4 attributed this to an incident\nwhere Youth B was escalated at nighttime outside. Staff 4 recalled\nYouth B telling her “They told me someone is going to come get\nme”. Staff 4 recalled hearing either Administrator 1 or Staff 5\nbringing up a murder suspect that was being sought by the police\nand saying something to the effect of “if you don’t come in, we\ndon’t know if that man is out in those woods” to Youth B. Staff 4\nrecalled telling Youth B from inside “You’re OK, just calm down\nand you will be able to come inside.” Staff 4 stated that she did\nnot go outside during the incident because she was providing\nsupervision of Youth C inside and Administrator 1 had told her to\nstay inside, even though Youth B was asking for her. Staff 4\nstated when Youth B did calm down and come inside, she came\nstraight to Staff 4 and was very upset that the murder suspect may\nhave been outside of the facility. Staff 4 recalled Youth B stating,\n“they told me there’s a man out in the woods and he’s trying to get\nme.” Staff 4 recalled talking to Administrator 1 about the incident\nafter it had concluded and Administrator 1 telling her “We told her\nthere were people in the woods so she wouldn’t run away.”\nStaff 5 was interviewed on 09/12/2023 during an announced on-\nsite visit to the facility. She recalled the incident where Youth B\nwas escalated, and she and Administrator 1 were trying to help\nher de-escalate and come back inside. Staff 5 stated this\nhappened around bedtime. Staff 5 stated she and Administrator 1\nstayed between the house and the small parking lot to the facility.\nThey tried to keep line of sight and communicate with Youth B, but\nnot approach her because she had started to hit and kick them\nwhen they were near her. She recalled Youth B banging on the\nwindows around the house during this as well. Staff 5 stated\nYouth B wanted to talk to Staff 4 and was yelling for her. Staff 5's\nrecollection was Staff 4 needed to stay inside because she had\nbeen providing line of sight supervision for Youth C at that time.\nStaff 5 recalled she and Administrator 1 tried to go hands on when\nYouth B was near them and hitting them but not being successful\nin doing so because Youth B would fall to the ground and then run\naway from them. Staff 5 recalled telling Youth B “when you stop\nhitting us, we will be able to go inside.” Staff 5 stated there was a\nrustling heard in the nearby woods just past the property line of\nthe facility and recalled Youth B asking what it was. Staff 5 stated\nshe told Youth B she could not see where it was and that it could\nhave been animals, or it could’ve been that person that had been\nin the news involving an attempted murder. She stated it was not\nsafe outside when you can’t see because it is getting too dark.\n6",
    "Staff 5 stated Youth B was still escalated after this part of the\nincident, but she eventually was able to calm down and come\ninside. Staff 5 recalled Administrator 1 wrote up the incident report\nfor this incident. Staff 5 even clarified she thought the topic of an\nalleged murder being sought by police in the same city as the\nfacility had come up in the building prior to this incident so Youth A\nmay have already known about it but could not remember\ndistinctly how. She stated youth may have overheard staff talking\nabout as there was a conversation earlier in the day about going\nto the park, but staff decided not to because that individual had\nnot been caught.\nYouth C was interviewed on 09/12/2023 during an announced\nface-to-face visit at the facility. Youth C recalled the incident.\nYouth B was escalated and outside. She stated she heard about\nsomething in the news about a murder suspect being stopped by\npolice in the city earlier in the day at an outside support group\nfrom the facility. Youth C stated she was inside but heard Staff 5\nand Administrator 1 say to Youth B “there’s homeless men in the\nwoods” and “Yeah, they will come and get you” while Staff 5 and\nAdministrator 1 were outside with Youth B.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed over a video call and\n09/13/2023. Administrator 1 recalled the incident. Administrator 1\nrecalled the incident lasted a very long time and it was difficult to\nreason with Youth B or understand exactly why she was upset or\nwhat could help her in the moment. Administrator 1 recalled it\nbegan inside the building, and Youth B ran out and as\nAdministrator 1 and Staff 5 followed her. They offered to take her\nback inside. Administrator 1 recalled Youth B yelling at her and\nStaff 5 about not getting enough attention and Youth B was\nwanting Staff 4. Administrator 1 recalled Youth B was walking\naround the house and finding rocks to throw at windows.\nAdministrator 1 recalled Youth B yelling for Staff 4 and stating\n“Help me because I don’t feel safe with them” referring to\nAdministrator 1 and Staff 5. Administrator 1 recalled a confusing\ndynamic with Youth B in that moment because Youth B would\napproach them or ask them to approach her and then, as soon as\nthey were within a couple feet of her, Youth B would attempt to hit\nand kick Administrator 1 and Staff 5. Administrator 1 recalled\nYouth B got in the vestibule of the building but threw punches at\nher and Staff 5 and ran back outside. Administrator 1 stated she\nand Staff 5 attempted to restrain Youth B but they were never\nsuccessful because Youth B would slip out of their grip or drop to\nher knees. Administrator 1 recalled Youth B asking something to\nthe effect of “What is out there?” referring to the woods just past\n7",
    "the parking lot of the facility. Administrator 1 recalled stating “I\ndon’t know what’s out there, why don’t we go inside?” in response.\nAdministrator 1 believed this line of questioning may have\nreminded Youth B of the news story about a possible murder\nsuspect not being caught by police. She stated she did not know if\nshe or Staff 5 said anything about this new story specifically to\nYouth B at the moment. Administrator 1 stated she was trying very\nhard to reason with Youth B but was having difficulty because\nYouth B wanted Staff 4 to be with her but did not want to go inside\nto see Staff 4.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• An incident reported dated 08/01/2023 authored by\nAdministrator 1 was provided and reviewed. Details were\nincluded in this documentation consistent with Staff 5 and\nAdministrator 1’s interviews, including Youth B’s escalated\nbehaviors outside the building. In the incident report it was\nwritten that “Youth B then walked around the parking lot\nand the field, crying and claiming to hear someone in the\nwoods. After some encouragement from staff, Youth B said\nshe was ready to go to bed.”\nIncident 2\nYouth A was interviewed on 08/15/2023 during an unannounced\nface-to-face visit at the facility. Youth A stated he uses\ninappropriate language at times and staff always “catch him” and\nredirect him to try to use more appropriate language. He stated\nthis is difficult because that’s what his brain wants him to say.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed over a video call and\n09/15/2023. She confirmed Youth A uses very sexually\ninappropriate and suggestive language on a consistent basis and\nresponding to Youth A’s inappropriate language is normal for staff.\nShe stated this is something that has normal repercussions and\nresponses from staff. Examples were provided of privileges being\ntaken away such as screen or tablet time in response to repeated\nuses of inappropriate language. In addition, Administrator 1\nstated this topic was a commonly communicated with Youth A’s\ntherapist.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Facility policy titled “Behavior Management” dated\n11/09/2022 was provided and reviewed. In this policy it\nwas noted a wide range of interventions for staff to use in\n8",
    "individual programming for managing behavior, including\nredirection and modeling as described by staff interviews.\nAnalysis Through interviews of youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was sufficient evidence found to show a violation\nof the rule because of the language and methods used by staff in\nresponse to escalated behaviors of Youth B described in Incident\n1.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n09/27/2023\n__________________________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 29, 2023\n__________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n9"
