An agency shall give a copy to and review\nthe parent-agency treatment plan with the parent or\nparents and foster parents. The agency must inform the\nparent or parents and foster parent that the information\nin the parent-agency treatment plan and any other\ninformation about the child and the child's family is\nconfidential.\nTwo of eight foster care files each held one treatment plan that did not have a\nsignature from the caregiver or parent to indicate the plan was reviewed and\nprovided to them.\n2",
    "CPA Rule 400.12605 Adoptive family evaluation\n(1) An agency social service worker shall complete a\nwritten adoptive evaluation within 90-days of the family\nsigning an adoption application and prior to approving a\nfamily for adoption.\nOne of three adoptive family assessments was not completed within the 90-day\ntimeframe.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED:\n4/12/23 RENEWAL, CAP approved 5/1/23\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTechnical assistance was not requested or provided.\nV. CONSULTATION\nConsultation was not requested or provided.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe CAP, approved 5/1/23, was the result of the 4/12/23 renewal evaluation. The\nagency was cited regarding borrowed homes, timely adoption evaluations, Family\nTeam Meetings, and quarterly Medical Passports. The agency reported successful\nimplementation of their CAP over the past year. During the 2024 review\nimprovement was found in all areas. However, there was one repeat violation\nregarding a timely adoption evaluation. The agency reported this to be due to\nunusual circumstances related to the applicant, which resulted in a denial, outside\nof the 90-day timeframe. The agency has already identified steps for a new CAP\nto avoid this in the future.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment, dated 9/22/23, was reviewed and discussed\non-site. The CA reported ongoing efforts to continue improvement in the areas\ncited in the 2023 review. Efforts included new tracking mechanisms, training,\nOutlook calendar sharing, increased supervisor oversight, usage of electronic\n3",
    "signatures, and ongoing discussion regarding barriers to compliance. The CA\nreported an overall increase in their key performance indicators.\nThe CA identified six unplanned moves for children over the past year. These\nmoves were from unlicensed relative homes, due to health issues of caregivers\nand other unforeseen circumstances.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency's 2022 financial audit was reviewed, as the 2023 review is not yet\ncomplete. The agency's 2023 budget was also reviewed. No financial concerns\nwere found.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site: one supervisor and one caseworker. Both staff\nreported they enjoy working at the agency and feel very supported by supervisors\nand administration. Staff stated they believe FCS is a great place to work, their\ncaseloads are manageable, staff get along well and rely on one another, and\nreceive the support they need. Neither staff had any concerns or suggestions for\nimprovement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same office building as previous years.\nThere is adequate space for staff and clients to meet and hold parenting time. The\noffice has sufficient secure storage for confidential information.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_ ___________March 26, 2024_________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n___ _______ March 28, 2024\n______________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4",
