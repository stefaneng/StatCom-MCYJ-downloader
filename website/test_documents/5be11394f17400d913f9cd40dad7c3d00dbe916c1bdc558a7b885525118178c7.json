    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection Program statement\nDescription (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Agency is not following their policies: Bedroom Policies, Team\nmeeting policies, or Incident Reporting Policies.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAllegation #1: Bedroom policies not being followed:\nOn 5/12/25, I spoke to Administrator 1 concerning the clutter and\nlarge number of items in the youth’s bedrooms. Administrator 1\nreported the youth are not to have the number of items in their\nroom as they currently do. Administrator 1 reported there was a\npolicy concerning the amount. Administrator 1 reported the youth\nare to clean up their rooms as well.\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the facility\non 5/21/25:\nYouth A reported she is supposed to clean her room and\ncomplete chores daily, but she does not always do so. Youth A\nreported that if she doesn’t clean her room or do chores, staff do\nnot do anything about it.\nYouth B reported they are to complete chores, including cleaning\ntheir room. Youth B reported the staff may remove an activity if\ncleaning doesn’t happen, but the youth don’t have to actually\nclean their room.\nYouth C reported they are to complete chores twice a day,\nincluding their room. Youth C reported if youth refuse staff will\ncomplete the chores for them.\nYouth D reported they are to complete chores and clean their\nroom. Youth D reported they are not allowed to have all of the\nitems they have in their room, but staff do not do anything about it.\nStaff allow them to get their items from the locked closet and don’t\n2",
    "ask for items in return, so youth have too many items in their\nroom. Youth D reported she is to have seven outfits in her room.\nYouth D reported she has double that amount plus 12 pairs of\nshoes and 12 stuffed animals and multiple books.\nYouth E reported everyone has chores but staff do not make\nthem complete them. Youth E reported that staff will complete the\nchores if they don’t do them.

Staff 1 reported he knows the\nyouth have too many items in their room, including clothing,\nshoes, hygiene and random items. Staff 1 reported since he is\nmale, he doesn’t go into the female rooms. Staff 1 reported the\nyouth are only to have a small number of items and only staff can\nobtain these items in the locked closet. Staff 1 reported staff are\nsupposed to make sure they have the allotted amount only. Staff 1\nreported he was never given a directive to remove the excess\nitems in the room. Staff 1 reported they don’t remove the items\nbecause the kids get angry if you ask them or would take their\nitems. Staff 1 reported there is a policy that male staff cannot go\ninto the female hallways so he doesn’t monitor their rooms.\nThe following interview was completed via telephone on\n5/22/25:\nStaff 2 reported that the youth do not complete their chores and\nthere are no consequences for this. Staff 2 reported the\nadministration pacifies the youth and will not allow consequences\nto occur. Staff 2 reported whenever the staff want to consequence\nthe youth, they are to call the upper management first and ask\nthem if it is okay. Upper management will state no, because they\ndon’t want the youth to get angry and then possibly restrained.\nUpper management was described as those above the unit\nmanager.\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility on 6/3/25:\n3",
    "Supervisor 1 reported youth are to complete chores and keep\ntheir rooms clean. Supervisor 1 reported if they don’t clean, then\nthe youth are not to receive their weekly money. Supervisor 1 did\nnot know what the weekly money was used for. Supervisor 1\nthought it was for when the youth left they would have money that\nthey had saved up in the program. Supervisor 1 reported there are\nso many restrictions on the youth now, that immediate\nconsequences wouldn’t help anyway. Supervisor 1 reported the\nyouth are to have a certain number of items in their room, but they\ndo have more than allowed. Supervisor 1 reported that the youth\nare not to have hygiene in their room but they do. Supervisor 1\nreported there is a locked closet with the youth’s clothing in it. If\nyouth want different items of clothing, they are to exchange what\nthey do have for the items they would want. Supervisor 1 reported\nthis is not happening. Supervisor 1 reported they do not want to\n“start issues with the kids” so they do not request the items back\nor do room sweeps to ensure they have the appropriate items in\ntheir rooms.\nSupervisor 2 reported the youth are to complete chores but they\ndo not always complete them. Supervisor 2 reported there was not\na consequence for not completing them. Supervisor 2 reported the\nyouth are to have a certain number of items in their room, but staff\ngive them too many. Supervisor 2 reported there is a locked closet\nwhere the items are at. Supervisor 2 reported the youth are to\nexchange the items they have for the items they would like.\nSupervisor 2 reported staff are providing items without gathering\nthe old. Supervisor 2 reported there are multiple staff who have\naccess to this closet, including the youth’s therapist. The youth will\nmanipulate and ask different staff through the day to get items.\nSupervisor 2 reported there is not a system in place to track this.\nSupervisor 2 reported they have discussed the youth’s items in\ntheir rooms, but “the kids do not want us touching their stuff. I\ncan’t take their stuff from them. We can only talk to them.”\nSupervisor 2 reported the youth will get upset if you take their\nitems.\nStaff 3 reported that youth are not allowed to have the items they\nhave in their room, Staff 3 reported youth manipulate staff by\nasking multiple staff for items. Staff 3 reported she does not know\nwhy they did not take the extra items back from the youth in their\nroom. Staff 3 reported if the youth do not complete their chores,\nthen the staff complete them. Staff 3 reported there are no\nconsequences to not completing chores.\n4",
    "Supervisor 3 reported that youth are to complete chores but can\nrefuse to complete them. If they refuse, then staff have to\ncomplete the chores for them. Supervisor 3 reported there are no\nconsequences when youth do not complete chores. They will\nreceive a “check” and if they get so many then a nighttime activity\nmay be taken away.\nStaff 4 reported youth are to complete chores but they refuse to\ndo so. Staff 4 reported there are no consequences for the youth.\nYouth will get a “check” which means they will not get “dollars” for\nthat activity. Staff 4 did not know what the dollars were and did not\nknow when the youth received them. Staff 4 reported staff give the\nyouth too many items for their room. Staff 4 reported the staff do\nnot enforce the rules because they don’t want to “get into it” with\nthe kids.\nObservation:\nI walked into numerous bedrooms. Bedrooms were cluttered with\nclothing, stuffed animals, numerous shoes (one bedroom had over\n9 pairs of shoes), stacked books (one bedroom had over 30\nbooks), blankets, hygiene products, and garbage bags filled with\nitems, tote bags filled with items, closed suitcase boxes with items\nin it. Some rooms had multiple bags and closed containers with\nitems piled in them. Some rooms had empty glass cups, written\nsigns with profanity on it, and garbage (empty snack bags, empty\ncups, rolled up papers on the ground, spoons, empty wrappers).\nThe rooms were unkempt and in disarray.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Items Allowed in Client Bedrooms (document): 9 outfits,\n4 pairs of shoes, 3 pajama gowns, 1 journal, 5 books, 1\npicture frame, 3 stuffed animals 1 drinking cup, 3 hair ties.\nAny additional items…will be placed in your personals until\nyou leave the program.\n• Staff and Client Interaction Policy:\no When making room checks, respect the client’s\nprivacy. A male staff member should never make\nvisual checks of residential client’s bedroom or\nbathroom area.\nAllegation #2 Staff are not attending team meetings\nStaff 1 reported he does not go to team meetings. They have\nmonthly unit meetings, and he just asks other staff what they\ntalked about. Staff 1 reported he has not received discipline for\nthis.\n5",
    "Staff 2 reported she goes to staff meetings once a month and\nthey discuss policies for the building. Staff 2 reported they don’t\ndiscuss how to intervene to uphold those policies.\nSupervisor 1 reported they have team meetings with staff.\nSupervisor 1 reported the staff are supposed to attend but if they\ndon’t they receive the agenda in an email. Supervisor 1 reported\nthey do not discuss group dynamics or specific goals of youth in\nthe team meeting.\nSupervisor 2 reported team meetings are mandatory but due to\nschedules not everyone can come. Supervisor 2 reported they\nalso have the option for staff to attend via video conference as\nwell. Supervisor 2 reported the team meeting minutes are up in\nthe office after the meeting for staff to review. Supervisor 2\nreported they don’t have a system to know if everyone has\nreceived the minutes if they didn’t show up. Supervisor 2 reported\nthey did have “Pre a Post meetings” which are meeting completed\nintermittently in the month based on dynamics of the youth.\nSupervisor 2 reported this would be done before a shift but it is not\ndocumented anywhere. The “Pre a Post meetings” were described\nas staff discussing any issues within the group before their shift\nstarted.\nSupervisor 3 reported team meetings are monthly and mandatory\nbut not everyone comes to the meetings. Supervisor 2 reported\nstaff can come via video conference, but they do not always do\nthat either. Supervisor 3 reported that one time the whole day shift\ndidn’t come to the meeting. Supervisor 3 reported there is no\ndiscipline for staff that don’t show up. Supervisor 3 reported they\nused to have “pre” and “post” meetings in between the monthly\nmeeting but they haven’t had those lately. Supervisor 3 reported\nwhen staff miss she will try to “catch” them by talking to them or\nemailing them.\nStaff 5 reported that she does not attend all the team meetings.\nStaff 5 reported there may be follow up meetings for staff that\ndon’t attend via zoom. Staff 5 reported there are no consequences\nfor failing to attend team meetings. Staff 5 reported they do not\ndiscuss interventions for staff to use with the youth. Staff 5\nreported they (the staff) will debrief each other on what happened\nthe night before during shift changes.\nStaff 3 reported she sometimes goes to team meetings in person\nand sometimes on a “teams” call. Staff 3 reported she thinks staff\n6",
    "get written up for not going but hasn’t been written up herself.\nStaff 3 reported that supervisors will inform staff of the details of\nthe meeting if they miss. Staff 3 reported there are minutes of the\nmeeting for staff to look at, but there is not a formal way to know\nthat all staff have received the minutes.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth Coach Position Description (Staff): Attends and\nparticipates in group sessions, in service training, and all\nstaff meetings.\n• Employee Behavior Policy: Enhance their job-related\nknowledge and skills by attending and participating in all\nstaff training offered on and off campus.\nAllegation #3:\nInterviews:\nYouth D was interviewed on 5/21/25. During her interview she\nreported that she was threatening and pushing staff and youth.\nShe reported this occurred on 5/19/25. Due to her behavior police\nhad come to the agency. Youth D reported she was arrested, and\nthe police officer pushed her and shoved her.\nAdministrator reported there was not an incident report\ncompleted for the incident on 5/19/25.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident Report Policy: Vista Maria must document all\ncritical incidents and any irregular occurrences or events\nthat are inconsistent with routine operations.\nAnalysis\nAllegation #1:\nThe agency is non-compliant with this rule. The youth’s bedrooms\nare cluttered and unsafe. All staff interviewed reported there are\ntoo many items in the room and multiple staff and supervisors\nreported they are unable to do anything about this. The agency\nhas a document outlining what is permitted in a room and they do\nnot follow this document.\nTechnical Assistance:\nStaff 1 reported he is not allowed to go into the female hallways.\nAll staff are to provide for the safety and security of youth, as well\n7",
    "as ensure youth are following policies. Policy does not state that\nthe males cannot enter into the hallways, but it does state they\ncan’t look into the bathroom or bedrooms. The hallways include\nbedrooms and bathrooms. If males are not able to complete visual\nlooks of the bathroom and bedrooms, then this is creating a safety\nissue and either males cannot work with females or the policy\nneeds to be altered to allow staff of any sex to supervise youth.\nThe agency can train the staff on appropriate boundaries and\nensure they have awareness from other staff if there are more\nhigh-risk situations.\nIt would benefit the agency to have a system to obtain clothing\nand personal hygiene. It would also benefit the agency to train\nstaff on structure, rules and interventions. Room sweeps and\nupholding the rules are within the staff and supervisors’\nparameters and clear consequences and actions to restore\ncompliance should be sought and discussed. Policies reviewed\ndid not outline specific interventions to use. Policies did not\nprovide procedures outlining how staff are to intervene.\nThe agency would benefit from looking into their behavior\nmanagement award and consequence system. The\nconsequences are not immediate and do not allow natural\nconsequences to take place. Staff are completing youth chores.\nThis disempowers the staff and places no responsibility on the\nyouth to complete their own tasks or take pride in the place they\nlive.\nConsultation:\nStaff and Supervisors feel disempowered and are afraid of youth\nresponses to their interventions. Staff feel that they are not\n“allowed” to consequent or take items from youth because this\nmay cause youth to be angry. If supervisors on the unit are afraid\nto redirect and challenge behaviors then either more intense\ntraining and oversight of the unit supervisors need to be\nestablished or different supervisors need to be placed in these\nroles, that can fulfil the job responsibilities. It may also benefit the\nagency to train staff on the definition of consequences in relation\nto the restorative model approach used by the agency. The staff\nappear to not be able to differentiate between punishment and\nconsequences.\nAllegation #2:\nThe agency is not compliant with this rule. Staff 1, Staff 3, Staff 5\nall reported they either do not attend unit meetings or are\n8",
    "inconsistent with attendance. Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, and\nSupervisor 3 reported that unit meetings are mandatory, but staff\ndo not always come to the meetings. The Youth Coach Position\nDescription outlines this as a task they are to complete. The\nEmployee Behavioral Policy outlines staff are to attend all\nmeetings.\nThe agency\nTechnical Assistance:\nStaff are not attending unit meetings. Unit meetings are only once\na month. Supervisors are responsible for the culture of their unit. If\nstaff do not attend the unit meetings, then there should be a\nformal way of addressing this. There also is to be a way where\nstaff receive the information they have missed. Unit Agenda\nMinutes are not specific and do not provide necessary information\nto understand the goals of the unit and each individual youth, nor\ntreatment interventions for the culture of the unit. This follow-up\nshould be formally done so that the team knows the plans and\ntreatment for the month. It is the agency’s responsibility that all\nstaff are well-informed and trained.\nConsultation:\nUnit meetings are held only once a month. Group culture changes\nand individual needs change often. Goals for individual youth and\naction steps to achieve those goals written in treatment plans can\nbe achieved much earlier than in a months’ time frame.\nScheduling therapeutic activities based on where the group is at\nand where individuals are, takes communication from all treatment\npartners, and should be done more often.\nWeekly or biweekly unit meetings would help provide more\nintense services. Youth could be discussed individually focusing\non their individual goals. Group dynamics and overall facility\nconditions could also be incorporated.\nAllegation #3:\nThe agency is non-compliant of this rule. The agency did not\ncomplete an incident report for Youth D’s assaultive behavior or\npolice contact.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2024SIC0001371, Intake 4/24/24; CAP Approved 10/21/24\n2024SIC0001471, Intake 5/29/24; CAP Approved 10/14/24\n2025SIC0000529, Intake 4/4/25, Cap Approved 7/9/25\n9",

Youth E reported she thinks that other\nyouth took her items. Youth E was unable to state what might\nhave been taken. Youth E did not report that staff lost her items.\nYouth I reported someone threw an item out of hers. Youth I did\nnot know what the item was or who threw it out.\nSupervisor 1, Supervisor 2, and Supervisor 3 were interviewed\nface to face at the facility on 6/3/25 and all reported they were\nunaware of youth missing items.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Multiple youth, staff, and\nsupervisors noted that staff have not lost youth items.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126\nSection Sufficiency of staff.\nDescription (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A reported staff are not intervening when youth become\nphysical.

    "Investigation Interviews:\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility on 5/21/25:\nYouth A reported the ratio of staff to youth are 1:3. Youth A\nreported there are not enough staff to stop fights from occurring.\nYouth A reported when youth fight the staff that is with them will\nattempt to push the youth apart but have to wait for other staff to\ncome help.\nYouth B reported she has been physically attacked by other\npeers, but staff did intervene and restrain them.\nYouth C reported physical fights happen between youth. There\nare times staff do attempt to separate but there are times they are\nunable due to lack of staff present. Youth C reported they need at\nleast two staff to restrain. Youth C reported that the agency is not\nallowed to restrain a youth without the second staff. Youth C\nreported individual staff have intervened and they have been fired.\nYouth C reported the agency was safer when those staff were\nhere because they stopped the fighting.\nYouth D reported she has seen youth physically fight and staff not\nintervene. Youth D reported they just “sit there.” Youth D reported\nthere are some staff that attempt to get in between the girls who\nare fighting and push them away from each other.\nYouth E reported she has seen youth physically fight each other.\nYouth E reported staff do verbally say something, but do not\nalways physically intervene. Youth E reported there are some staff\nthat do get in between the youth fighting.\nYouth F refused to be interviewed.\nYouth H and Youth I both reported there are fights in the unit and\nstaff are not able to immediately break them up. Both reported the\nstaff will call for assistance and then when assistance comes,\nbreak up the fight. Both reported in the meantime the youth are\nfighting.\nStaff 1 reported the ratio of staff to youth is 1:3. Staff 1 reported\nthere are a lot of “call offs,” which create a problem for ratio. Staff\n1 reported he didn’t have to restrain so this is not an issue for him\nand was unable to state if other staff were not intervening when\nnecessary.\n12",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed via telephone on 5/22/25. Staff 2 reported\nthey don’t have enough staff to always restrain the youth so they\nhave to wait until assistance comes. This may mean youth are\nfighting until then. Some staff will step in and try to break it up.\nThe following interviews were completed at the facility on\n6/3/25:\nSupervisor 1 reported she has witnessed where youth are\nfighting, and staff are not intervening. Supervisor 1 reported there\nwas a fight where one girl was being assaulted by two other girls\nand the staff present did not intervene. Supervisor 1 could not\nremember the name of the staff, but stated it was Youth G that\nwas hurt by the other girls. Supervisor 1 reported they have a staff\nshortage so when youth are fighting, they will call out for a “clear”\nand then any staff available will come to help. If they don’t have\nstaff, then they contact the campus and then wait for those staff to\narrive. Supervisor 1 reported they do have to wait until another\nstaff arrives because their restraint model trained needs two staff\nto perform the restraint.\nSupervisor 2 reported when youth are fighting they are unable to\nrestrain unless they have the proper number of staff (2) to perform\nthe restraint. When youth fight, they call for a “clear” and wait for\nhelp to arrive. Supervisor 2 reported the youth are fighting in\nbetween that time. Supervisor 2 reported that if she attempts to\nget involved then the youth she isn’t grabbing may get hurt by the\none she is holding on to.\nSupervisor 3 reported that if youth are fighting in the building,\nthey are to call for assistance. Supervisor 3 reported they need\nminimally two staff to restrain a youth with their restraint model. If\nthe staff in the building do not come, then they are to call for\nassistance from the campus. Supervisor 3 reported that youth are\nfighting while waiting for help.\nStaff 4 reported that when youth start to fight, they are to call for\nassistance due to not having enough staff to restrain. Staff 4\nreported there are times when they need multiple staff to help in\nthe situation. Staff 4 reported there are staff that will attempt to\nbreak it up until help comes otherwise you have to wait while the\nyouth are attacking each other.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n13",

Although the agency is\nin the staff to student ratio outlined in their Program Statement,\nthey are unable to provide for the protection of the youth they are\nsupervising at that ratio. Both staff, youth, and supervisors all\nacknowledged that youth were assaultive in their groups and staff\nhad to wait for additional staff to come to the unit to help separate\nor restrain the youth. Sometimes they wait for additional staff that\nwere in the same building and other times they had to request\nstaff outside of their buildings. Either way, staff are unable to\nintervene to provide safety due to lack of staffing. When there is a\nneed for more staff, based on the unit’s culture, the agency is to\nmake the necessary additions in staffing to provide that safety.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000510, Intake 6/1/23; CAP Approved 7/27/23\n2024C0000873SI, Intake 10/27/23, CAP approved 12/4/23\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4149\nSection Youth nutrition\nDescription (1) A licensee shall provide a minimum of 3 nutritious edible\nmeals daily unless medically contraindicated and\ndocumented.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The food is toxic.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility on 5/21/25:\n**All individuals interviewed reported there are three meals a\nday served as well as two snacks.\nYouth G, Youth B, Youth E, reported the food is not seasoned\nwell, but it is cooked and not expired.\n14",

Staff 2 reported\nthe food does not taste good due to lack of seasoning, but there\nhas never been spoiled or rotten food.\nThe following interviews were completed at the facility on\n6/3/25:\nSupervisor 1, Supervisor 2, Supervisor 3, Staff 4, and Staff 5\nreported they have never seen mold on food, rotten food, or\nundercooked food.\nSupervisor 1 reported she has never received a complaint about\nthe food.\nSupervisor 2 reported the youth refuse to eat vegetables and\nfruit.\nSupervisor 2, Supervisor 3, and Staff 3 reported that if the youth\nwon’t eat the food, then they buy them pizza.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Client Food Service Policy: …will meet the dietary needs\nof our clients as established by the National Dietary\nAssociation…weekly menus distributed to all units…\n15",
    "Analysis The agency is compliant with this rule. The youth are provided\nwith the right amount of food. Youth A was the only youth who\nstated the food was moldy and rotten. There appears to be a time\nthat the food may have been undercooked, but Youth D, Youth H,\nand Youth I all reported they received pizza that night. No one\ncomplained of expired food except Youth A.\nConsultation:\nStaff and youth interviewed reported the food was not seasoned\nwell. It would be beneficial for the agency to look into the quality of\ntheir food as well as providing condiments and seasoning in the\nunits if the food department does not season the food. The unit\nalso has a kitchen in the unit. It may be good for the youth to cook\ntheir own meals with staff supervision as a life skill as well.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4150\nSection Incident reporting\nDescription (4) When a resident's behavior results in contact with law\nenforcement, the incident shall be reported to the parent/legal\nguardian, responsible referring agency, and the licensing\nauthority as soon as possible, but not more than 24 hours\nafter the incident.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth’s behavior resulted in law enforcement, and this was not\ncommunicated to licensing authority.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth D was interviewed on 5/21/25. During her interview she\nreported that she was threatening and pushing staff and youth.\nShe reported this occurred on 5/19/25. Due to her behavior police\nhad come to the agency. Youth D reported she was arrested, and\nthe police officer pushed and shoved her.\nAdministrator reported they did not notify DCWL of the incident.\nAdministrator reported he was off on those days so it was not\ncompleted.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n• Incident Report Policy: Vista Maria policy does not state\nthat the licensing authority is to be notified.\n16",
    "Analysis The agency is non-compliant with this rule. The agency did not\nnotify the licensing authority within 24 hours. The policy does not\noutline the licensing authority as an entity that is to be provided\nthe incident report.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe agency is to update their policy to include the licensing\nauthority as recipients of incidents involving youth and law\nenforcement. It is to be noted that it is the agency’s practice to\nsend the licensing authority these incident reports, yet it is not in\npolicy.\nAdministrator was not working on this particular day, so this\nincident report was not sent out. This should also be addressed in\nthe policy, all the specific individuals who are responsible for\nsending reports and those responsible if Administrator is not\navailable.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4157\nSection Behavior management\nDescription (2) At a minimum, the behavior management system shall\ninclude all of the following:\n(b) Positive intervention strategies to assist residents in\ndeveloping improved problem solving, self-management, and\nsocial skills.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff are not using positive intervention strategies to deescalate\nyouth, but provoking and instigating youth\nInvestigation Interviews:\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility on 5/21/25:\nYouth A, Youth B, Youth C, and Youth G reported that staff\nstate things that upset youth, but were unable to provide any\nspecific situations or statements that staff would make.\nYouth E reported staff do not say anything. They just sit there.\nYouth D reported a staff stated once, “If she did that to me I would\nbeat her ass.” Youth D did not know who stated this and could not\nprovide any other details.\n17",
    "Youth H and Youth I reported she has not heard staff provoke\nyouth.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 both reported they have not provoked youth or\nheard other staff provoke youth. Both reported they tell the youth\nwhat they are to do and they refuse to do it.\nStaff 2 reported that management will not let them consequence\nyouth or set limits with them when asked about positive\ninterventions strategies.\nThe following interviews were completed on 6/3/25:\nSupervisor 1 reported she has not heard about staff provoking\nyouth and she has not provoked youth as well. Supervisor 1\nreported they discuss interventions in the team meetings. When\nasked what the specific interventions for the youth were now, she\nstated the focus is to stop them from fighting. She was unable to\nprovide the specific interventions. Supervisor 1 reported there are\na lot of things they, as staff, are supposed to be doing but staff are\nnot completing due to not wanting to start issues with the youth.\nSupervisor 1 reported the youth are on restrictions for their\nbehaviors so there isn’t any more they can do. Supervisor 1\nreported they do not discuss individual youth goals or action steps\nor interventions in team meetings. They do not discuss “group\ndynamics” and group interventions.\nSupervisor 2 reported she did not hear staff provoking youth.\nSupervisor 2 reported the youth state they don’t like the way staff\ntalk to them. Supervisor 2 did not hear the staff talk to you in an\ninappropriate manner but did address staff. Supervisor 2 reported\nshe has had conversations with staff to use different ways and\nhave a “softer” manner in redirecting youth. Supervisor 2 reported\nthey used to have “Pre a Post Meetings” where they discussed\ninterventions before the start of staff shifts, but they have not been\nhaving them as frequent as they probably should. Supervisor 2\nreported these are not formally documented. Supervisor 2\nreported they have monthly unit meetings. Supervisor 2 reviewed\nan agenda with me and reported they do not go over individual\nyouth goals or specific interventions for specific youth. Those are\nfor the therapist to know. Supervisor 2 did report that if the\ntherapist knew the youth was going to go through something\ndifficult that the staff should be mindful of that later in the night, but\nspecifics would not necessarily be given. Supervisor 2 reported\n18",
    "they also don’t write down interventions in the agenda and they do\nnot follow up with them the following month.\nStaff 4 reported she has not seen staff provoke youth. Staff 4\nreported most staff know how to intervene with the youth, they just\nchoose not to do so. Staff 4 reported they don’t discipline the\nyouth and don’t enforce the expectations with the youth. Staff 4\nreported staff are inconsistent in how they run the unit.\nStaff 3 reported she has not seen staff provoke youth. Staff 3 was\nasked about positive interventions. Staff 3 reported they have\ndiscussed interventions for the cleanliness of the rooms and\nbuilding lately. Staff 3 reported an “intervention” was to tell the\nyouth to give them the extra stuff in the room. Staff 3 reported\nafter that there wasn’t anything else noted to do. Staff 3 reported\nyou can look at the team meeting minutes to see if there is\nanything staff are to complete.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Agenda: I reviewed the agenda for 1/21/25. There are no\nspecific goals, interventions, or youth mentioned in the\nagenda. The only interventions noted in the agenda were:\no Language of clients: suggest other words for clients\nto use\no Cleanliness of unit: staff need to make sure building\nis always clean\no Client should not play in staff hair\no Staff should not do clients hair\nI also reviewed Agendas for 2/18/25, 3/18/25. 4/15/25.\n2/18/25: No specific interventions noted.\n3/18/25:\no Cleanliness of the unit: if the kids are not doing the\nchores they need to be marked “no” for the day and\nstaff need to pitch in and do them\no If the kids don’t do their chores or hygiene they can’t\ndo other activities\no Buildings need to be tour ready\no Interact with the kids keep them engaged and\noccupied\no Unit meetings are mandatory\n4/15/25:\no Cleanliness of the unit: if the kids are not doing the\nchores they need to be marked “no” for the day and\nstaff need to pitch in and do them\n19",
    "▪ Staff that have to stay back from school or for\nany other reason should vacuum/mop unit\no Buildings need to be tour ready\no Tap out if you need it\no Beware of burn out\no Debrief with oncoming shifts\n• Client Behavior Management Policy: Behavior\nmanagement is tailored to the desired behavior. Effective\nstrategies require that: an inappropriate behavior is coupled\nwith a restorative task. ...are to be individualized, age\nrelated, and short term.\nAnalysis The agency is found non-compliant with this rule. Staff and\nsupervisors were unable to provide interventions for the unit and\nfor individual youth. The things they did mention were, the inability\nto provide consequences and to tell the youth to clean. Supervisor\n1 and Supervisor 2 both reported they do not discuss individual\ngoals for youth or individual interventions for youth or group goals\nor group interventions. Review of the unit meeting agenda also\nconfirms what the supervisors reported. Staff do not know the\npositive intervention strategies to use and are not given direction\nin what to practically do with each individual youth as noted in the\nClient Behavior Management policy.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThere appears to be a disconnect in the treatment team.\nSupervisor 2 reported that the therapist knows the goals and\ninterventions but not the unit team. The entire treatment team\nshould be aware of the goals in the treatment plans and the\ninterventions that are to be used to help the youth achieve those\ngoals. The Clinical team and staff and supervisors appear to not\nhave the same information to provide for the same outcome. In\norder to provide trauma informed care, staff must understand the\ntrauma of their youth and be provided with goals and individual\ninterventions.\nConsultation:\nIt would benefit the agency if the team meetings discussed\nindividual youth specifically their goals and action steps and\ninterventions that staff are to complete during school and\nresidential time. These should be outlined in the team meeting so\nall staff are aware of the interventions. It would be beneficial to log\nthese interventions in the unit logging and state the outcome of\nusing that intervention for further assessment. Staff then can be\nconsistent and all parts of the team are working on the same goals\n20",
    "with the youth, but in a different manner, based on their role. Unit\nmeetings can then discuss the interventions used and what\nworked well and what did not. The team can adjust as needed.\nThis would provide the direction that appears to be lacking in the\nunits.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection Intervention standards and prohibitions\nDescription (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing a youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Unknown staff pushed Youth C around and then lied about it.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Youth C on 5/21/25. Youth C reported she has\nnever been pushed by staff. Youth C reported she has been in\nfights with other youth and staff had to intervene and separate\nthem, but those were the only times staff touched her.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Youth C reported no one\nhas ever pushed her.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection Intervention standards and prohibitions\nDescription (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(iv) Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a\nyouth's background or appearance or mental state.

    "Allegation Staff are talking rudely, disrespectfully and cursing at youth\nInvestigation Interviews:\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility on 5/21/25 and 6/3/25:\nYouth G, Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, Youth E, Youth\nH, Youth I, Staff 1, Staff 2, Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2,\nSupervisor 3 all reported they have not heard staff talk\ndisrespectfully towards youth or curse at them.\nYouth F refused to be interviewed.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. None of the individuals\ninterviewed disclosed verbal abuse from staff to youth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159\nSection Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction, prevention;\nDescription prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints\n(5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the\nseverity of the youth's behavior, chronological and\ndevelopmental age, size, gender, physical condition, medical\ncondition, psychiatric condition, and personal history,\nincluding any history of trauma, and must be done in a\nmanner consistent with the youth's treatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff are not restraining youth in the correct manner\nInvestigation Interviews:\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility on 5/21/25 and 6/3/25:\nYouth A, Youth B, Youth H, all reported they have not seen a\nrestraint that was inappropriate.\nYouth G reported she does not get restrained and does not pay\nattention to when others do.\nYouth C reported she has not seen restraints due to there not\nbeing enough staff to restrain.\nYouth D reported staff either separate youth who are fighting or\ndon’t do anything.\n22",
    "Youth E reported that if youth are fighting some staff have pulled\nthe youth off of each other. Youth E reported that is all she has\nseen.\nYouth F refused to be interviewed.\nYouth I reported that staff will use their body as a shield to protect\nyouth at times. Youth I reported that staff “can’t protect us\nbecause they are not allowed to grab us, move us away from each\nother, or push us away from each other which makes it unsafe for\nus and staff.”\nStaff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, and\nSupervisor 3 reported they have not seen or been involved in an\nunsafe restraint.\n**See additional finding under R.400.4127\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. No one has reported they\nwitnessed a restraint that was not done appropriately. Youth I\neven reported the staff should be able to intervene more often\nbecause they can’t restrain due to policies.\nConsultation:\nThe agency may want to look at a different restraint model or\nteach techniques to separate youth who are getting ready to fight.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4407\nSection Facility and premises maintenance\nDescription (1) A facility and premises shall be maintained in a clean,\ncomfortable, and safe condition. The facility shall be located\non land that is properly drained.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The facility is in deplorable conditions; broken and boarded up\nwindows and walls, flooring torn up, missing lights, trash\nthroughout the units, walls filthy, furniture missing cushions, and\nsensory room not usable due to damaged equipment.\nInvestigation Observation:\nI observed the facility on 5/21/25 and 6/3/25. On both occasions\nthere were broken and boarded up walls in the living space, the\n23",
    "bedrooms, and bathroom. In one bedroom, the tile floor was torn\nup in front of the window.\nI walked into numerous bedrooms. Bedrooms were cluttered with\nclothing, stuffed animals, numerous shoes (one bedroom had over\n9 pairs of shoes), stacked books (one bedroom had over 30\nbooks), blankets, hygiene products, and garbage bags filled with\nitems, tote bags filled with items, closed suitcase boxes with items\nin it. Some rooms had multiple bags and closed containers with\nitems piled in them. Some rooms had empty glass cups, written\nsigns with profanity on it, and garbage (empty snack bags, empty\ncups, rolled up papers on the ground, spoons, empty wrappers).\nRooms were upswept, cluttered, and needed cleaned and\ndecluttered. The rooms were unkempt and in disarray. Both\nbathrooms used by the unit were cluttered with towels and\nhygiene items on the floors, and garbage overflowing.\nI viewed the sensory room. It was in good condition, but it was not\nused due to the behaviors of the youth.\nThe main area couches did have cushions on them.\nAll lights worked in the unit.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n• Standard Cleaning Policy: All staff must follow cleaning\nprocedures as recommended by the Center for Disease\nControl….tie trash liners in waste containers and remove\nthem…spot wipe walls, doors furniture…mop or power\nscrub floors and shower areas…sweep all floors and\nshower areas daily…vacuum all furniture and carpet…no\nvisible soils, streaks on floors, doors, counters and other\nhard surfaces…\n• Program Statement: The agency provides services to\nindividuals with mental health needs…with a variety of\npsychiatric needs.\nAnalysis The agency is non-compliant with this rule. The facility is not clean\nor comfortable. Due to the clutter and unkempt areas, the facility\nconditions make it unsafe for youth to reside. The population in\nthe unit are youth with a variety of mental health issues and\npsychiatric needs. The conditions of the rooms allow for youth to\nhide dangerous items to hurt themselves and others. The physical\nenvironment of the facility is unsafe for the youth they provide care\nfor.\n24",
    "Technical Assistance:\nThe policy outlines for staff to complete the cleaning in the units.\nThe policy does not outline if staff are completing this while they\nare supervising youth or after their shifts. If they are completing\nthis while on their shift, then the policy needs to document who is\nsupervising the youth, while the cleaning is occurring. The policy\ndoes not outline who is monitoring this cleaning or documenting\nthis cleaning. This should be a part of the procedure of the policy.\nThere is not a policy and procedure for youth cleaning the unit and\nwhat chores they are to complete. This will need to be added.\nConsultation:\nIt would benefit the agency to incorporate a policy where youth\nclean their living space, kitchen space, and staff guide them in\ndoing it properly.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n7/1/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
