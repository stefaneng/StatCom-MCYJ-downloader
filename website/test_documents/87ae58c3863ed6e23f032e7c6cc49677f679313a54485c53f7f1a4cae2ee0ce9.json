INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of Staff\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth K reportedly misused social media on a device at the facility\nalleging inadequate staff supervision.\nInvestigation I left a voice message informing Complainant I was assigned this\ninvestigation alleging inadequate supervision by Vista Maria staff.\nI did not hear back from Complainant.\nI notified Foster Care Worker 1, and Foster Care Worker 2 who is\ncovering in Foster Care Worker 1’s absence, via email that I was\nassigned this investigation.\nI notified Placement Collaboration Unit via email that Dearborn\nHeights Police took a report from Youth K on 4/18/23 at 4:30pm.\nCase #23-10838\nI notified Vista Maria’s Rights Officer of the allegation against\nVista Maria.\nI requested and reviewed Vista Maria’s Semi-Independent Living\n(SIL) Program Handbook for Myriam Hall youth. The handbook\nindicates electronics are allowed (cell phone, laptop, tablet,\ngaming system) after the youth successfully completes the first 14\ndays of orientation.\n2",
    "Youth K was admitted to Myriam Hall on 2/22/23 and completed\nthe orientation on 3/8/23. Thus, she was allowed to use\nelectronics at the time this allegation was received.\nThe handbook also indicates the following regarding social media:\nResidents are not allowed to share information of a resident, not\nallowed to send personal messages of an individual to peers on\ncampus and people in the community, not allowed to face time a\nresident when talking with an individual off campus, and not\nallowed to video/audio record a resident/tenant. This rule also\napplies to social media of staff. Overall, any forms of electronic\ncommunication (social networking, microblogging, photo sharing,\nvideo sharing, book marking sites, etc.) of an individual on\ncampus are prohibited (not allowed to happen).\nI interviewed Youth K, age 17 years and 11 months, on 4/18/23\nwith Rights Officer present. She is cognitively impaired with\nmental health issues and has resided in various programs on\nVista Maria’s campus since July 2019. Youth K admitted that two\nto four weeks ago in Myriam Hall, she used her facility-issued\ncomputer to communicate with a male (age unknown, possibly 16\n- 22). Contrary to the SIL handbook, she said she believed that\nafter 30 days in the program, “we can contact anyone or send\nanything” via electronic device. Youth K did not appear to recall\nthe program’s written rules for social media use.\nYouth K said that staff at the facility did not monitor her device use\nor internet activity after she completed orientation because they\nare not supposed to. However, after her sister told Therapist that\nYouth K had internet exchanges with a male, she said Therapist\nconfiscated her computer on 4/17/23. “I won’t be using that\ncomputer anymore,” Youth K added.\nI interviewed Therapist on 4/18/23 with Rights Officer present.\nShe said Youth K was just transferred to her caseload one week\nprior. Therapist confirmed she confiscated Youth K’s computer\nafter the youth’s sister claimed Youth K had interacted\ninappropriately with a male on the internet who the sister believed\nto be an adult. Therapist said, “I talked to Foster Care Worker 2\nand her GAL (guardian ad-litem) approved us to remove the\ncomputer. We recommended the sister report this to the\npolice…She (Youth K’s sister) reported it to CPS.” However, to\nTherapist’s knowledge, no one had reported it to law enforcement\nto date.\n3",
    "I asked Therapist to contact Dearborn Heights Police immediately\nand file a formal police report. Before I left the facility Therapist\ntold me she contacted the police, and they were on their way to\nMyriam Hall to interview Youth K and take her statement. Later\nthat day, Therapist informed me via email that a police officer\narrived and had taken a report.\nAnalysis In terms of staff failing to supervise Youth K’s internet and device\nactivity, there is no requirement for staff to supervise devices for\nSIL youth. After completing orientation, youth are trusted to\nmonitor their own activity in accordance with the social media rule\nin the SIL handbook.\nAdditionally, however, upon receipt of information that Youth K\nhad potentially misused this privilege, Therapist confiscated her\ncomputer/device.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 19, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 24, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
