    "ALLEGATION:\nFacility has been out of ratio in the afternoon and evening, with a unit having one\nstaff to supervise 8 youth. This leaves youth in danger.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 07/19/21 from the DCWL online complaint website.\nThe anonymous complainant left no contact information. The information in the\ncomplaint is as follows. During the afternoon and evening the campus was working\nout of ratio, sometimes with a unit only having one staff with 8 kids. This left kids and\nstaff in danger. Multiple units were out of ratio. This reportedly occurred on Sunday,\nJuly 18th from 12:30pm onwards through the day. This reportedly occurred at the\nfollowing cottages: Junkhe, Cotcher, Harrison and Burnham and the staff and\nsupervisors are aware. The complainant further noted, ‘During a phone call with my\nchild staff said that there were not enough staff around campus to accommodate\nphone calls or for the kids to go outside. My kid also told me that staff were coming\nin and out and that they never have staff on the weekends. Dinner was being\nprepared late and at one point that staff on the phone said they were by themselves\nwith 10 kids.’\nOn 07/19/21, Consultant 2 forwarded an email from Administrator 2 regarding\nstaffing. Administrator 2 emailed, ‘We have not had issues with maintaining ratio with\nthe exception of occasional calls offs which are then covered by supervisors if\ncontingents cannot be found to cover.’\nI met with Administrators 1 and 2 at the facility on 07/20/21 and advised them of the\nallegations. Documentation was requested. Administrator 1 acknowledged that they\nare tight with staffing but was not sure if they had been out of ratio on 07/18/21.\nI spoke with Consultant 2 on 08/09/21 and she reported having been onsite with\nConsultant 3 on 08/06/21. During their onsite, a supervisor was crying and feeling\npanicked about the lack of staffing. Safety planning was established with\nAdministrator 2 and consisted of the facility not taking new placements until staffing\ncan be stabilized and for therapists and case managers to cover shifts if needed.\nConsultant 3 emailed with the following information related to her 08/06/21 onsite\nvisit, ‘I had interviewed a Residential Supervisor, and Youth Specialist 2 and they\nboth reported they are short staffed and are always out of ratio. They didn’t provide\nspecific dates but did say it’s usually second shift.’\nOn 08/11/21, I interviewed Youth Specialist 1 via phone. Youth Specialist 1 reported\nthat the previous weekend, they were the only staff with 11 kids in the Cotcher\ncottage. There was a supervisor reported to be there also. Youth Specialist 1\nworking 12-hour days and reported the “staffing is getting worse.”\n3",
    "On 08/11/21, I exchanged emails with Administrators 1 and 2 to advise of the likely\nlicensing violations for this investigation. Administrator 2 confirmed the following\nrelated to staffing in an email, ‘I actually informed Consultants 2 and 3 that we have\na freeze on admissions which has been communicated with RPU and our\nadmissions department. In addition, case managers and therapist are on an\nafternoon rotation where they will be covering any vacancies.’\nDocumentation reviewed for this investigation is as follows, with applicable\ninformation outlined:\n Staff schedules provided by Administrator 1, for the identified cottages, were\nreviewed for July 18th. Administrator 1 also provided a census for each\ncottage for that date as well. It was observed from the information provided\nthat the facility was not in compliance with staffing ratios as two of the\ncottages were short staffed per their ratio.\n Facility policy, Section F. Number 3. Child Supervision: 2. MCHS schedules\nstaff to maintain a 4:1 ratio. Staff should strive to maintain this ratio, though\nthere will be times when staff cannot, such as when a child goes AWOL, or\nduring a restraint. This does not mean that staff are out of ratio because there\nare ample staff scheduled to respond to the child issues.\n MDHHS RFCAN Contract:\nStaffing Ratio, The Contractor shall:\na. Provide a minimum of one on-duty direct care worker for every 4\nchildren during waking hours.\nb. Maintain a minimum of one on-duty direct care worker for every 10\nchildren during sleeping hours. All of these staff shall be awake during this\nperiod. Room checks must be conducted at variable intervals of no more\nthan every 15 minutes between checks during sleeping hours.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as they were confirmed to\nhave been out of ratio compliance on 07/18/21 based on the\ndocumentation they provided. Additionally, it has been reported\nby staff and acknowledged by the administrators that they are\nnot always able to meet ratio on other days and in various\ncottages.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nCited under the contract\nSIR 2021C0108045; CAP pending\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nAugust 24, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 26, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
