Youth B and Youth C both made PREA complaints\nagainst Youth A as well, but they were false. They alleged Youth\nA touched their breast and bottoms. When Youth A told staff\nYouth B was touching Youth A, they would say there was no proof\nbecause the cameras did not work.\nInvestigation This complaint came in after all youth had been removed from the\nfacility and all staff either reassigned or terminated. A complaint\nwas being investigated under Special Investigation\n2023C0000368 and this additional information was received and\nassigned as a separate investigation.\nInterviews\nDuring a previous investigation Youth B/Complainant was\ninterviewed by a courtesy DHHS Worker on 5/2/23 and reported\nYouth C would touch Youth B’s head and neck and stare at her\nwhen she was sleeping. She further reported Youth A would ask\nabout having sex with her and would touch her thigh. Youth B\nreported she informed the treatment leaders, Staff 1 and Staff 2,\nbut nothing was done to address the issue.\nYouth B was interviewed by phone on 10/2/2023.

After this\nthey did not get along and even got into a fight. Youth A's behavior\nescalated after that. Youth B said Youth A would rub up against\nher in line. Youth A said she brought the incident up to the\nsupervisor. Youth B could not recall the name of the supervisor.\nAfter Youth B told she moved bunks right next to Youth A. Youth B\nwrote a statement and gave it to Staff 2. Staff 2 laughed at her\nand never gave the statement to the supervisor. About a month\nlater she wrote another statement and put it in the grievance box.\nAfter she wrote the second statement, she talked to a PREA\nperson. She could not recall who the PREA person was.\nYouth A was interviewed by telephone on 8/25/23. She\nreported she left the facility in November of 2022. She said she\nwas on the same unit as Youth B and they even shared a\npersonal isle (P isle) where their beds were near each other.\nYouth A stated she hated Youth B.
