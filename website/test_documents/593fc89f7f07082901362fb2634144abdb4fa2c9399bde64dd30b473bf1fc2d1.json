INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404 Placement\nSection • (4) An agency shall consider all the following factors in\nDescription selecting an appropriate placement for a child:\n• (h) The continuity of relationships, including\nrelationships with parents, siblings, relatives, foster\nparents, previous foster parents, and other persons\nsignificant to the child.\n1",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency facilitated a change in placement with Youth A and\nYouth B and did not replace them into the home of a previous\ncaregiver.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Caregiver by phone on 08/04/2025. Caregiver\nstated the children were doing well in Caregiver’s home but were\nremoved to be placed with a relative. Caregiver stated the\nchildren were involved in another move that did not include a\nreturn to the Caregiver 's home or the placement with a relative.\nCaregiver stated Caregiver would have liked to have had the\nchildren returned to Caregiver's home. Caregiver reported they\nappealed the children's removal from their home when they were\nplaced with a relative. Caregiver described Mother of the children\nas not liking Caregiver or getting along with Caregiver.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator and Program Manager by\nphone on 10/01/2025. They reported the children were replaced\nfrom Caregiver's home to a relative placement. Chief\nAdministrator and Program Manager reported this case was\nsubsequently transferred to another agency on 4/04/2025 due to\nstaffing shortages for this agency. Chief Administrator and\nProgram Manager stated Caregiver had appealed the removal of\nthe children to the Foster Care Review Board at the time of the\nrelative placement. The findings of the Foster Care Review Board\nwere supportive of the change in placement. Chief Administrator\nand Program Manager reported two concerns when the children\nwere placed with Caregiver. One concern was Caregiver did not\nget along with Mother of the children and Mother did not want the\nchildren placed with Caregiver. A second concern was that a\nfoster home special evaluation had to be completed with\nCaregiver when an allegation was made Caregiver used physical\ndiscipline with the children by slapping their hands when they\nwrote on the wall/furniture of the home. Although no marks or\nbruises were noted as a part of the special investigation,\nCaregiver admitted that form of discipline at the time. Chief\nAdministrator and Program Manager reported a return to the\nCaregiver was considered, but not pursued due to concerns\nrelated to discipline methods, the need for a corrective action plan\nfollowing the determination of a special evaluation that was\ncompleted, opposition by the mother of the children for placement\nwith Caregiver, and Caregiver’s difficult relationship with the\nmother.\n2",
    "I interviewed Foster Care Worker by phone on 10/10/2025.\nFoster Care Worker reported the placement consideration\nsituation consistent with the description reported by Chief\nAdministrator and Program Manager.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the Foster Care Review Board findings and\ndetermination the Foster Care Review Board was supportive of\nthe agency's change in placement from Caregiver’s home to the\nrelative/fictive kin home.\nI reviewed Foster Home evaluations and the special investigation\nreport on the home of Caregiver. The findings of the special\nevaluation included Caregiver admitting to the inappropriate\ndiscipline and the development of a corrective action plan.\nI reviewed the placement records of the children. The placement\nrecord indicated placement in the home of Caregiver from\n08/13/2024 to 12/06/2024, Relative/Fictive Kin 12/06/2024-\n03/10/2025, and 03/10/2025-5/13/2025 in another licensed foster\nhome. The case management/supervision was transferred to\nanother agency 04/04/2025.\nI reviewed the TDM meeting associated with the children’s move\nfrom Caregiver’s home to the relative/fictive kin dated 11/21/2024.\nThis TDM was initiated in response to the mother of the children\nrequesting the children be placed with the relative/fictive kin.\nCaregiver was invited but chose to not attend/participate in this\nmeeting if the children were going to be moved. One of the\nconcerns of the mother of the children associated with Caregiver\nwas the Caregiver encouraged/allowed the children to call her\n“Mama C” despite the mother asking Caregiver not to.\nI reviewed the TDM dated 03/07/2025 associated with the\nchildren’s change in placement from the relative/fictive kin\nplacement. Participants identified in this TDM were the\nrelative/fictive kin caregiver, agency foster care worker, agency\nsupervisor (Program Manager), children’s paternal grandmother,\nMDHHS POS supervisor, agency licensing specialist, and\nMDHHS Facilitator. It was noted Caregiver was not invited due to\npreviously reported concerns related to the care of the children.\nThe plan associated with this TDM was to assess the paternal\ngrandmother for placement while the children were in a\ntemporary/short term foster home placement. The case\nmanagement supervision of this case was transferred from this\nagency shortly following the completion of this TDM.\n3",
    "I reviewed the Placement Selection Criteria rating for the\nplacement of Youth A and Youth B in the home of Caregiver. This\nplacement selection criteria identified a rating of 4 for placement\nwith relative, a rating of 4 for religious preference, and a rating of 4\nassociated with the expressed preference by the child. This scale\nis rated from 1-4 with 1 being the best/highest rating/preference\nand 4 the worst.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with the rule per interviews\nand case files reviewed. It was found the agency considered\nCaregiver, but placement was not facilitated due to the identified\nprevious concerns.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/09/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 10, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
