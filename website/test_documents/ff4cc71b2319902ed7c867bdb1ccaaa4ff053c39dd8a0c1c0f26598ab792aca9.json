INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities\nSection • (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\nDescription directly responsible for all the following activities:\n1",
    "• (a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home\ncare. Social service workers shall work directly with\nthe children, their families, and other relevant\nindividuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service\nplans for the children and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Care Worker is not adequately monitoring health care\nservices of Youth A to ensure adequate health care is provided.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed MDHHS Worker by phone on 05/02/2025. MDHHS\nWorker reported/alleged the caregiver of Youth A was not\nproviding adequate care for Youth A and the agency\nmonitoring/supervising the case management should have been\naware. MDHHS Worker stated he is in the process of obtaining\nmedical records of Youth A and would forward that information to\nme when it is received. I subsequently received that information\non 05/05/2025 and 05/28/2025.\nI interviewed Foster Care Supervisor 2 (FC Supervisor 2) by\nphone on 07/10/2025. FC Supervisor 2 stated the agency\nassumed case management responsibility in November 2024\nwhen the relative caregiver moved to their area. FC Supervisor 2\nreferred me to Foster Care Supervisor 1 for additional information.\nThe information they received at that time indicated the medical\nneeds for Youth A were being met and the caregiver was directed\nto find appropriate medical services providers in the new area.\nI interviewed Foster Care Supervisor 1 (FC Supervisor 1) by\nphone on 07/10/2025. FC Supervisor 1 stated she had recently\nassumed supervisory responsibility for this case on 03/27/2025.\nFC Supervisor 1 reported Youth A has been released from the\nhospital and is currently placed with a different caregiver. FC\nSupervisor 1 stated that she would see that I received any\ninformation requested to assist in the completion of this\ninvestigation. The information/observations at that time indicated\nthe medical needs for Youth A were being met and the caregiver\nwas directed to find appropriate medical providers in the new\narea, which the caregiver had done.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator by phone on 07/11/2025. We\ndiscussed the allegations and the level of\nsupervision/communication the agency maintained with the\n2",
    "caregiver of Youth A, especially as it related to the provision of\nmedical services. We also discussed the circumstances related to\nthe change in placement of Youth A and Youth A's sibling. Chief\nAdministrator stated he would send me the requested information\nrelated to the agency's monitoring/supervision of case\nmanagement services. That information was subsequently\nreceived by email on 07/11/2025.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker and FC Supervisor 1 by\nphone on 08/07/2025. Foster Care Worker stated she had no\nconcerns regarding the medical care and treatment being\nprovided. Foster Care Worker described the caregiver as\ncooperative in communicating with Foster Care Worker regarding\nYouth A’s medical care. Foster Care Supervisor also expressed\nno concerns regarding the medical care of Youth A.\nI interviewed Adoption Worker by phone on 08/14/2025.\nAdoption Worker stated Youth A appeared to be receiving\nappropriate care. Information Adoption Worker received from\nmedical service providers did not indicate any concerns regarding\nthe care of Youth A.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nYouth A had a medical diagnosis dated 8/2/24 that included\nFailure to Thrive, Cerebral Palsey, Disease Nervous System,\nGlobal Develop Delay, and Feeding Intolerance. A diagnosis\ndated 4/8/25 added Anemia, Hearing loss, and GERD.\nThe information received from Chief Administrator by email\nindicated the following:\n• Bethany Christian Services took over case management on\n11/4/24. During the case transfer meeting with the prior\nagency, they indicated that medical services would need to\nbe transferred to care providers in this area due to her\nmoving. In our initial contacts with the relative she\nindicated that Hurley’s had not provided referrals for\nservices, but indicated she was to find new providers. At\nthat time the relative indicated she was able to contact a\nprimary care provider, and an initial visit was already\nscheduled for 12/10/24. She indicated that no help was\nneeded in identifying providers at this time, as she was\nalready scheduled.\n• First contacts with the child and caregiver are recorded by\nboth foster care and adoption on 11/6/24. Prior to Youth\nA's initial well child exam with Bronson on January 13,\nfoster care staff had four in person home visits with Youth A\n3",
    "and the caregiver, and adoption staff had two in person\nhome visits. Additional contacts including text messages\nand phone calls to the caregiver also occurred during this\ntime. There is documentation in case contacts of the worker\ninquiring of the family’s needs and the family did not report\nany needs, including with transportation. It was reported\nthat Youth A's appointment in December was rescheduled\ndue to a snowstorm on her scheduled date that did not\nmake travel safe. There was no reported concern for a lack\nof transportation on that date or any other date. Her next\nscheduled date, January 13, was attended. The statement\nshe provided at the January 13 appointment about\ntransportation difficulties was not anything she had shared\nwith our staff as noted above.\n• On 1/28/25 the relative provided names of services\nproviders to the foster care case manager, who indicated\nsharing the information with the agency’s health liaison.\nMedical documentation was requested from Bronson on\n2/27/25 and documentation was received on 2/28/25.\nDocuments that were obtained on 2/28/25 indicated full\ncompliance with visits with the PCP, nutrition, weight\nchecks, gastroenterology, and PT evaluation.\n• March contacts with the family did not identify any needs or\nconcerns for the welfare of the children.\n• As of the March 17 home visit there were no concerns\nnoted as to the caregiver's ability to meet Youth A's needs,\ndespite all of the contacts with medical professionals in\nJanuary and February (Appt dates of 1/13, 1/24, 1/28, 1/29,\n2/ 20, 2/25, 2/27). It appears that it was in March that care\nand attendance of appointments for Youth A declined\nsignificantly despite the prior engagement with the\nproviders and our agency.\n• From the time of us accepting the case, communication\nand responsiveness of the caregiver to our staff was not\nreported to be a concern. She interacted well with staff and\nwas responsive to communication and appeared engaged.\n• Youth A entered the hospital on 4/9/25. The caregiver did\nnot report this hospitalization to our staff, and we\ndiscovered that she had been hospitalized on 4/16/25 when\nwe received the MDHHS complaint, this lack of\ncommunication by the caregiver was outside of the norm\nbased on prior interactions. MDHHS reached out to us via\nemail requesting information that afternoon and it was\nfollowed shortly after by an email from the MDHHS\nsupervisor expressing concern about the placement based\non the initial information they had just received from a\n4",
    "doctor. Our staff responded immediately supporting the\nconcern and that we were looking to identify alternative\nhome(s) for the children and would coordinate with the\nMDHHS investigator after his home visit. Due to Youth A\nbeing an MCI ward, MCI staff was included on the initial\nemail regarding the allegations. As information was shared\nby investigators and hospital staff on 4/16/25, Bethany\nChristian Services foster care and adoption staff\ncommunicated and agreed with the assessment of concern\nfor her welfare if returned to the relative caregiver’s home.\nThis concern is documented in email conversations from\nthat day that indicate support for removing both children\nfrom the relative caregiver’s home. Due to the caregiver\nhaving a signed intent to adopt, MCI consultation prior to a\nmove was required and occurred on the same day. MCI\nresponded that they were assessing the removal need. By\n4:59pm that day our on call staff was on their way to\nKalamazoo to pick up the sibling for a medical exam and to\ntransport to a new placement.\nI independently reviewed the case record of Youth A and the\ndocumentation in the case record is consistent with the narrative\nreported by Chief Administrator. The record included the following:\n• The case record documented Foster Home Visit contact\nwith Youth A on 11/06/24, 11/27/24, 12/2/24, 12/18/24,\n12/23/2024, 1/13/2025, 2/3/2025, 3/17/25, 3/27/2025,\n04/24/2025, 05/19/25, 5/23/25, 5/28/2025, 6/06/25, 6/11/25,\nand 6/19/25. The contacts all indicated/documented the\nchild was observed and appeared to be doing well with the\ncontinuation of medical needs being met/provided.\n• I reviewed the medical records for Youth A both prior to this\nagency's assumption of the case as well as the time\nfollowing the agency's assumption of responsibility. There\nwas no indication in any of these records that would alert\nthe agency that the caregiver was not providing appropriate\ncare to meet Youth A's medical needs until the\nhospitalization of Youth A on 04/09/2025. The dates of\nmedical care being provided by Hurley medical personnel\nprior to the caregiver’s relocation were 5/15/24, 5/30/24,\n6/5/24, 6/6/24, 7/2/24, 7/16/24, 7/22/24, 8/15/24, 8/19/24,\n8/21/24, 9/4/24, 9/9/24, 9/18/24, and 9/25/24 with all\nincluding statements of “no concerns”. Visits associated\nwith new medical providers following the caregiver’s\nrelocation were documented for 1/13/25, 1/24/25, 1/28/25,\n1/29/25, 2/19/25, 2/25/25, 2/27/25, 3/5/25, 3/13/25, 3/18/25,\n3/20/25, 3/27/25, 4/3/25, 4/10/25, 4/11/25, 4/13/25, 4/14/25,\n5",
    "4/15/25, 4/16/25, 4/29/25, 5/6/25, 5/13/25, 5/20/25. These\ndocuments indicated no concerns regarding the caregiver’s\nparticipation in services for the child.\n• A Foster Care Review Board hearing was completed\n05/01/2025 as a result of the caregiver appealing the\nchange in placement of Youth A. The findings of the Foster\nCare Review Board were supportive of the caregiver of\nYouth A.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as staff interviews, medical\nrecords reviewed, and case record documentation reviewed\nindicated the agency staff maintained levels of contact and\ncommunication with Youth A and the relative caregiver of Youth A\nconsistent with compliance with applicable licensing rules. The\nfindings of the Foster Care Review Board Hearing are supportive\nof this determination/analysis.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n8/7/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 14, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n6"
