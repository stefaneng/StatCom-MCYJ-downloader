In this\nexample the employee had an identified date of hire of 03/06/20 and the central\nregistry clearance was completed 03/13/20. The clearance was clear.\nR 400.12310 Initial evaluation.\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the evaluation. The\nplacement specifications shall include the following:\n(a) Age\n3",
    "One of the six current foster home files reviewed included an evaluation report with a\nplacement specification for age that was different from the subsequent license\n(3706). In this example the report date was 08/26/20 with an age range identified as\n5-7 years and the license identified an age range of 5-6 years.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the reevaluation.\nThe placement specifications shall include all of the following:\n(d) Number of children preferred by the family\nOne of the six current foster home files reviewed included an evaluation report with a\nplacement specification that did not include the number of children appropriate for\nthe family. In this example the license identified a capacity of 3 and no capacity was\nidentified in the recommendations for a report dated 01/07/20.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(8) An agency shall complete a reevaluation and shall make a\nlicensing recommendation to the department at least 15\ncalendar days before the expiration date of the foster home\nlicense.\nOne of the six current foster home files reviewed indicated the recommendation for\nthe renewal of the license was not submitted at least 15 calendar days before the\nexpiration of the license. In this example the license had an expiration date of\n12/19/20, the evaluation report was dated 12/16/20, and the transaction record\nsubmitted for the renewal was signed 12/09/20.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in the\nagency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(d) Notify all social service workers who have children placed\nin the home that a special evaluation has been initiated.\nOne of the four special evaluation reports reviewed did not include documentation\nthe social service worker with children placed in the home was notified that a special\nevaluation had been initiated. The intake of this evaluation was identified as\n10/19/20.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(2) An agency shall inform foster parents of all of the following\nbefore they are questioned or interviewed regarding a special\nevaluation:\n(c) That the foster parents may involve a person of their\nchoice in any interviews with them involving the special\n4",
    "evaluation if the involvement does not impede the timely\ncompletion of the evaluation.\nTwo of the four special evaluation reports reviewed did not include documentation\nthe foster parents were informed they could involve a person of their choice in any\ninterviews with them if the involvement does not impede the timely completion of the\nevaluation, or the reason why another person could not be involved.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(4) Before completion of the written report required by subrule (5\n6) of this rule, an agency shall provide the foster parent with a\nverbal summary of the preliminary findings at the conclusion of\nthe evaluation.\nOne of the four special evaluation reports reviewed indicated the foster parent was\nnot given a verbal summary of the preliminary findings at the conclusion of the\nevaluation. The intake of this evaluation was identified as 10/19/20.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of the\nfollowing information:\n(d) Dates and places of contacts, names of persons\ninterviewed, and names of the interviewers. If children are\ninterviewed, their last names shall not be included in the report.\nOne of the four special evaluation reports reviewed included the last name of a child\nthat was placed in the home. The intake date of this evaluation was 04/25/20.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(c) Provide a copy of the report to any social services worker\nthat has children placed in the home.\nFour of the four special evaluation reports reviewed did not include documentation\nthat a copy of the report was given to the social services worker that had children\nplaced in the home. This was discussed at the time of the exit conference that if the\nworker was given a copy of the report the agency needs to provide appropriate\ndocumentation for compliance with this rule.\nR 400.12422 Foster care record.\n(3) The record shall contain all of the following information:\n(e) Change of placement documentation as required by\nR 400.12405.\nOne of the two discharged youth records reviewed did not include change in\nplacement / discharge documentation as required by this rule. In this example the\n5",
    "youth had an identified date of discharge of 09/23/20 and the documentation for this\ndischarge was not located.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(1) An agency shall develop service plans with the child, the\nchild’s parents or legal guardian, the referring agency, and\nother parties involved in providing needed services, or medical\ncare, unless the agency documents why any of the entities\nhave not been involved.\nOne of the six current foster child records reviewed did not contain adequate\ndocumentation a service plan was developed with all the entities required by this\nrule. In this example it was for the service plan with a time period of 12/7/20 to\n1/04/21.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each\nchild and parent or parents, as follows:\n(a) Within 30 calendar days from removal from the\nhome.\n(b) Within 120 calendar days after the initial removal and\nat least once every 90 calendar days thereafter.\nOne of the six current foster child records reviewed indicated an initial service plan\nwas completed outside the time frame identified by this rule. In this example the\ninitial service plan had an end date of 04/23/20 and it was completed 05/04/20.\nOne of the six current foster child records reviewed indicated an updated service\nplan was completed outside the time frame identified by this rule. In this example\nthe end date of the updated service plan was 01/15/21 and this updated service\nplan was not located at the time of this review.\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(4) If an emergency change in placement is necessary, then all\nof the documentation required in subrules (2) and (3) of this\nrule shall be in the child’s record within 14 calendar days after\nthe change in placement.\nTwo of the six current foster child records reviewed the youth had a change in\nplacement that was not documented as required by this rule. The first example had\nan identified change in placement 07/10/20 and the documentation for this change\nwas completed/dated 08/03/20. The second example had an identified change in\nplacement 06/08/20 and the documentation for this change in placement was not\nlocated at the time of this review.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n6",
    "(7) If any violations are cited and there is a signed corrective\naction plan, all social service workers who have children placed\nin the home shall be notified there is a corrective action plan\nand what is required of the foster parent in that plan.\nOne of the four special evaluation reports reviewed did not include documentation\nthe social services worker with children in the home were notified of what was\nrequired of the foster parent in the corrective action plan.\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(1) An agency’s medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(c) A physical examination for each child as follows,\nunless a greater frequency is medically indicated:\n(i) For a child under 2 years of age, a physical\nexamination shall have been completed within 3\nmonths before being placed in foster care or a new\nphysical examination shall be completed within 30\ncalendar days after being placed in foster care.\nOne of the six current foster child records reviewed did not include a physical of the\nfoster child within the time frame established by this rule. In this example a physical\nwas due by 12/30/20 and the medical passport did not have a documented physical\nat the time of this review.\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(1) An agency’s medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(c) A physical examination for each child as follows,\nunless a greater frequency is medically indicated:\n(ii) For a child 2 years of age or older, a physical\nexamination shall have been completed within 12\nmonths before placement or a new physical\nexamination shall be completed within 30 calendar\ndays after placement.\nOne of the six current foster child records reviewed did not include documentation\nof a physical within 30 days of placement of the foster child as required by this rule.\nIn this example a physical was due by 4/25/20 and it was completed 8/20/20. It\nwas reported at the time of the exit conference that COVID 19 restrictions\ncontributed to this delay.\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n7",
    "(1) An agency’s medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(c) A physical examination for each child as follows,\nunless a greater frequency is medically indicated:\n(iii) A physical examination every 14 months.\nTwo of the six current foster child records reviewed did not include documentation\nof an updated physical being completed within the time frame established by this\nrule. In the first example the most recent physical was dated 3/19/19 so an updated\nphysical was due by 5/19/20. In the second example the most recent physical was\ndated 8/20/20 and the previous physical was dated 4/01/14. This agency did not\nassume this case until 3/25/20.\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(1) An agency’s medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(f) The provision of a dental examination and any\ntreatment required for each child who is 4 years of age\nand older, including both of the following:\n(i) A dental examination within 12 months before\nplacement or a new dental examination shall be\ncompleted not more than 90 calendar days after\nplacement.\nOne of the six current foster child records reviewed did not include documentation a\ndental examination had been completed within the time frame established by this\nrule. In this example the youth had a completed dental exam dated 7/27/20 that\nwas due 6/25/20.\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(1) An agency’s medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(f) The provision of a dental examination and any\ntreatment required for each child who is 4 years of age\nand older, including both of the following:\n(ii) A dental reexamination shall be obtained at least\nevery 18 months, unless a greater frequency is\nindicated.\nOne of the six current foster child records reviewed did not have a completed dental\nexam within the time frame established by this rule. In this example the most\n8",
    "recent dental was completed 3/19/19 so an updated dental was due 9/19/20 and\nthere was no documentation this dental had been completed.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the following:\nISEP 4.22 MiSACWIS (Commitment 22). DHHS will maintain an operational\nstatewide automated child welfare information system (“MiSACWIS”) which will be\nthe primary tracking system and satisfy federal reporting requirements.\nDocumentation for some of the six foster child records reviewed were not uploaded into\nthe MISACWIS information system. Examples of the missing documentation for some of\nthe records were maintaining updated medical passports as required, timely uploading of\noccasional treatment plans and Parent Agency Treatment Plans (PATP). The omissions\nwere occasional/the exception, and not a reflection of the overall documentation by the\nagency. It is my assessment that case manager turnover was a contributing factor.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract violation. Please note that there\nare additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance will all additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements except\nfor the following:\nDHHS Policy 722-06B page 1-7 Family Team Meeting\nFAMILY TEAM MEETING PROTOCOL Case planning is a cooperative effort in which\nthe child and family’s strengths and needs are assessed in partnership with the family,\ncaseworker, and other team members. FTMs are held to facilitate this process, which\ninvolves developing a road map for moving children to permanence promptly, while also\naddressing safety and well-being. The Michigan Family Team Meeting Protocol has\nidentified all required steps that must be accomplished during the FTM.\nTwo of the six current foster child records reviewed did not have adequate\ndocumentation that a Family Team Meeting (FTM) was completed as a part of every\nservice plan review. Each of the two foster child records had inadequate documentation\nof the completion of an FTM. The first example for the time period3/9/20 to 6/5/20, and\nthe second example for the time period 5/26/20 to 8/23/20.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas\nNone Needed.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nThere was one critical alert from the analyst’s visit to a relative home that did not have a\nworking alarm on the door of the home leading to the back yard where a pool was\n9",
    "located. The relative installed an appropriate alarm and video documentation was\nreceived from the agency on 01/21/2021 confirming a working alarm.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nA substitute caregiver was involved in inappropriate drug usage and the foster parent\nalso had a drug screen testing positive for inappropriate drugs. The agency\nsubmitted a recommendation for the revocation of the foster home license.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe agency submitted a corrective action plan for the renewal evaluation completed\n10/30/2019. Areas identified in noncompliance as a part of that evaluation were R\n400.12306(4), R 400.12324(8), R 400.12326(1)(c)(d)(h), R 400.12327(6)(c), R\n400.12418(6), ISEP 4.22 MISACWIS, and DHHS Policy 722-06 B Family Team\nMeeting. Areas identified as repeat noncompliance as a part of this interim evaluation\nare R 400.12327(6)(c), R 400.12324(8), ISEP 4.22 MISACWIS, and DHHS Policy\n722-06 B Family Team Meeting.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n02/22/2021\n________________________________________\nMark R.
