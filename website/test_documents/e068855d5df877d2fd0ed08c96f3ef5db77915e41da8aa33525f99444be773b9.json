This lasted well over a month. MIC ended up\nsubstantiating the substitute caregiver who was attempting to\nbecome licensed. The licensed foster home is licensed through\nLapeer County, but the TCW is a ward out of Oakland County.\n2",
    "Investigation The reporting source had no additional information to provide\nother than what was stated in the allegation.\nSeveral attempts were made to contact the foster parent of Youth\nA. The foster parent did not make herself available for an\ninterview. The telephone number provided was not accessible to\nleave a message for a call back.\nThe Foster Care Worker was interviewed via telephone on\n1/23/2023. She reported the history of Youth A. Oakland County\nDHHS has full responsibility for Youth A. She reported Youth A\nwas placed in a licensed foster home (Lapeer County DHHS) from\n10/11/2022 – 12/7/2022. She reported Youth A has severe\nmental health behaviors and had a long history of aggression and\nself-harm behaviors. These behaviors included running into the\nstreet attempting to be hit by cars, banging his had hard against a\nhard surface, making suicidal and homicidal statements,\ndestruction of property, defiant behaviors and verbal and physical\naggression towards children and adults.\nThe Foster Care Worker reported a foster care action summary\nwas completed on Youth A on 10/11/22. She reported the reason\nfor the change of placement from his parent was due to the\nparent’s mental health status and making threats against MDHHS,\nGuardian Ad Litem (GAL), other workers, and the referee. It was\nreported that Youth A was placed with an aunt and cousin but had\nto be removed due to his behaviors. MDHHS reached out to other\nrelatives and fictive kin for placement, but no one was willing to\ntake Youth A.\nThe Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed via\nTEAMS on 1/23/2023. She said Youth A was placed in a licensed\nfoster home on 10/11/2022. However, the foster home Youth A\nwas placed in had three other children in the home with behavioral\nissues. She said the foster parent had a friend who lived very\nclose who offered to be the substitute caregiver for Youth A.\nThe Foster Care Supervisor reported that the substitute\ncaregiver that was willing to assist the foster parent with Youth A\nwas in the process of being licensed through Lapeer County\nDHHS. It was discussed by DHHS License of Lapeer County and\nthe Foster Care of Oakland County DHHS that when the\nsubstitute caregiver receives her license, Youth A will be placed in\nthe home of the substitute caregiver because she will become a\nlicense foster home. The FCS explained that Lapeer County\n3",
    "DHHS Licensing Supervisor reported they had a large caseload\nand would not be able to approve the home study quickly. The\nsubstitute caregiver 3130 was completed by Lapeer County DHHS\nin September of 2022. Therefore, Oakland County Licensing\nagreed to take the case and complete any additional work that\nwas needed to get the substitute caregiver licensed so that Youth\nA could be place in the home of the substitute caregiver as a\npermanent placement.\nThe FCS explained that when Oakland County DHHS received\nthe case from Lapeer County DHHS, it was in the beginning of the\nDHHS system change to CWLM. Oakland County DHHS could\nnot update the case or route the assessment of the substitute\ncaregiver from Lapeer County to Oakland County DHHS because\nthere was a delay with the system and Oakland County DHHS did\nnot have access to route the 3130 for completion. A helpdesk\nticket was created to assist with helping to license the substitute\ncaregiver’s home. The FCS said when Oakland County DHHS\nreceived the access to route the 3130, the case would be\ntransferred back to Lapeer County DHHS as a licensed foster\nhome of the substitute caregiver and Youth A would be permanent\nplace with the substitute caregiver due to the substitute caregiver\nbecoming a licensed foster home.\nThe Foster Care Supervisor and Foster Care Worker were\nconsistent in reporting at no time did Youth A spend long periods\nof time at the substitute caregiver’s home during this process. The\nFCS said Youth A would spend time at the substitute caregiver\nhome several times a month for several hours and return home to\nhis licensed foster parent’s home. She said the substitute\ncaregiver would pick Youth A up from school sometimes and\ntransport him to appointments such as therapist appointment that\nwas scheduled to assist the foster parent who cared for three\nother youths placed in her home. The FCS could not identify the\ndates Youth A was transported or the dates he spent the several\nhours in the substitute caregiver home. However, she was\nadamant in stating that Youth A was not living or staying with the\nsubstitute caregiver on a consistent basis but did go to the\nsubstitute caregiver home to play video games and to deescalate\nif he was feeling anxious at the home of his foster parent and\nneeded to get away. The FCS said Youth A had bonded with the\nsubstitute caregiver.\nFCS said Youth A was approved for the Serious Emotional\nDisturbance Waiver through Genesee Health System and 120\n4",
    "hours of substitute caregiver placement per month through\nGenesee Health System.\nThe FCS said the foster parent and the substitute caregiver made\nand agreed to the arrangements. The FCS said Lapeer Licensing\nSupervisor, the GAL and the courts were aware of these\narrangements. The FCS reported there was a Team Decision\nMaking (TDM) that took place on September 23, 2022, whereby\nLapeer County DHHS agreed to allowed Youth A in the substitute\ncaregiver home to provide support to the foster parent due to the\nconcerns of the behaviors of Youth A. FCS reported that the\nparent, GAL, Lapeer Licensing Supervisor, Oakland County\nLicensing Supervisor, foster care worker and foster care\nsupervisor were in attendance. The FCS reported that the\nsubstitute caregiver, and the foster parent were involved in Youth\nA's Wraparound meetings, therapy appointments, as well as\nattended Youth A’s court hearing that was held in November\n2022. FCS said this was all in the effort to help with the eventual\ntransition of Youth A to the substitute caregiver’s home upon the\nsubstitute caregiver getting licensed.\nI reviewed a report written by DHHS dated 11/30/2022. The\nreport stated that on 11/22/2022, 911 was dispatched for a well-\nbeing check on Youth A. Youth A was almost hit by a car trying to\ncross a busy road. The allegation was that Youth A had an\naltercation with one of his peers at school. The substitute\ncaregiver picked Youth A up from school and transported him to\nher home. Upon arriving at the substitute caregiver home, the\nsubstitute caregiver put Youth A on punishment and took his toys.\nYouth A got upset and begin destroying the bedroom and\nattempted to jump out of the window. The substitute caregiver\ngrabbed Youth A by his shirt to prevent him from jumping out of\nthe window. Later, Youth A ran away, and the substitute caregiver\nran after Youth A as Youth A ran into the road. The substitute\ncaregiver grabbed Youth A again by his shirt to prevent him from\ngetting hit by a car. Youth A disclosed to the dispatcher that the\nsubstitute caregiver was physically abusing him. It was found that\nYouth A has some small abrasions around his neck from his shirt\nbeing pulled by the substitute caregiver. Youth A also had some\nsuperficial scratches on his neck due to substitute caregiver\ngrabbing Youth A by his shirt to prevent him from jumping out of\nthe window and preventing him from running into the road. It is\nwritten in the report that Youth A ran away a second time, and the\nsubstitute caregiver did not go after Youth A to bring him back to\nher home, instead, Youth A was returned back to the home by two\nunknown males. The recommendation of the report is that it was\n5",
    "confirmed and substantiated as a category III with a moderate risk\nfor improper supervision. This was due to the substitute caregiver\nnot attempting or looking for Youth A when he ran away from her\nhome the second time.\nIt should be noted that when the above allegation was made,\nYouth A did not go back to the substitute caregiver home.\nThe Substitute Caregiver is not licensed through Lapeer County\nDHHS or Oakland County DHHS. She is no longer interested in\nthe process.\nFCS reported that Youth A was sent to the emergency on 12/7/22\ndue to suicidal concerns. The FCS said Youth A was released\nfrom the hospital and placed with Harbor Oaks Hospital on\n12/28/2022. She said upon Youth A’s release, Youth A will be\nplaced with another licensed foster home who does not have other\nyouths in the home with similar behaviors as Youth A.\nDocuments reviewed:\nYouth A’s case record in MiSACWIS was reviewed on 1/24/2023.\nOther than what was reported regarding his behaviors, no other\ninformation was relevant to this investigation.\nFoster Parent Case record in CWLM was reviewed on 1/18/2023.\nThere was a special investigation open on the foster home on\n1/17/2023, regarding Youth A and the foster home. There were\nno violations found on the foster home.\nFoster Care/Juvenile Justice Action Summary- this report\nsummarized the reason for Youth A’s removal from his relatives.\nCommunication Issuance – 17-168 on Substitute Care. The CI\nstates that a substitute care provider does not need to be a\nlicensed provider. This was issued on 12/11/2017.\nDHHS investigation report dated 11/30/2022 on the substitute\ncaregiver home.\nAnalysis\nBased on policy and the Communication Issuance 17-168 on\nSubstitute Care, a substitute care provider does not need to be a\nlicensed provider to care for a youth in their home. This is driven\nby the need of the substitute care.\nBoth foster care supervisor and foster care worker were adamant\nin stating that Youth A did not live in the home of the substitute\ncaregiver but assisted Youth A’s licensed foster parent with\ntransportation of Youth A to his varies appointments and allowed\n6",
    "Youth A to come to her home (Substitute Caregiver) to de-\nescalate when he felt anxious or needed to get away. In addition,\nYouth A had 120 hours of substitute caregiver placement per\nmonth through Genesee Health System.\nAn allegation was made on the home of the substitute caregiver\nby Youth A on 11/30/2022. Youth A was no longer allowed to visit\nthe home or be transported by the substitute caregiver. The\nsubstitute caregiver was substantiated on improper supervision of\nYouth A due to not attempting or looking for Youth A when he ran\naway from her home the second time on 11/22/2022.\nBased on interviews from staff, documentation, and the\nCommunication Issuance 17-168 which states, “Approved\nAbsences from Placement: The following are instances in which\nthe child can be in an approved absence from their placement that\ndo not require placement changes or capacity changes to licensed\nfoster homes.\n• Substitute Care: Short term care and supervision for a foster\nchild in the absence of the caregiver. Substitute care is driven\nby the caregiver’s need for substitute care. The substitute\ncare provider does not need to be a licensed provider. If the\nsubstitute care provider is a licensed provider, a capacity\nchange does not need to occur.\nYouth A was allowed to spend time at the substitute caregiver\nhome per policy outlined in the communication issuance. The\nagency followed DHHS policy regarding a substitute caregiver,\ntherefore, no violation was established.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n7",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that Oakland County DHHS current\nlicense status be continued.\n5/4/2023\n______________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n5/18/23\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n8"
