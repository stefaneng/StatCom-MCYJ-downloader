    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section\n1. The facility is in compliance with all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a MDHHS Contract violation. Please\nnote that there are additional MDHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may\nnot be included in section 1. The facility is in compliance with all additional\nMDHHS Contract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nFOM 722-08C Parent Agency Treatment Plan and Service Agreement\nUpon completion of the parent-agency treatment plan and\nservice agreement, the parent is given a copy for review. Foster\ncare workers need to ensure the parent understands all areas\nwithin the agreement. Parents and youths age 14 and older\nmust sign the PATP…\nOne of three foster care files did not have a signed PATP as required. The 9/27/20\nPATP was missing the father’s signature.\nFOM 801-03 Medical Passport\nAll medical information within the medical passport must be\ncurrent and updated at least quarterly to reflect the child's\ncurrent and complete health information.\nOne of three foster care files held a Medical Passport that was not updated\nquarterly.\nFOM 722-06B Family Team Meetings\nPage 5 & 12\nSemi Annual Transition Plan Meeting- Within 30 calendar days\nafter the youth’s 14th birthday and every six months thereafter.\nThe DHS-1105, FTM Report, must be completed for every FTM\nTwo of three foster care files did not have FTMs completed as required.\nFile One: A semi-annual transition plan had not been completed since 11/19/19.\nFile Two: An FTM held on 6/23/20 did not have an accompanying 1105.\n4",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nPATP signatures- In one reviewed case, the child was placed with the non-\nrespondent parent. As the parent was not on the petition and did not have a\ntreatment plan developed, the agency did not require his signature on the child’s\nPATP. However, the signature is still required as the parent is the placement for the\nchild. This requirement was verified with MDHHS policy office.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require consultation during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP, approved 8/10/20, was required\nas a result of the 7/8/20 interim review. The agency continues to follow the CAP and\nhas shown improvement in all previously cited areas; no repeat violations were\nfound.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\nMay 19, 2021\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 19, 2021\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
