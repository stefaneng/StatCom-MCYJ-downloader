DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules except for\nthe following:\nCPA Rule 400.12324 Reevaluation\n• (4) An agency shall document placement\nspecifications consistent with the information\ncontained in the reevaluation. The placement\nspecifications must include all the following:\n• (a) The age, number, SOGIE, race, ethnic\nbackground, and characteristics of\nchildren preferred by the applicants.\nThree of Three files of open foster homes reviewed contained reevaluation\nreports that did not include the family's placement preferences regarding youths'\nSOGIE.\nCPA Rule 400.12327 Special evaluation\n• (5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the\nevaluation, an agency shall complete a written\nreport that includes all the following information:\n• (c) Dates and places of contacts, names\nof persons interviewed, and names of the\ninterviewers. If children are interviewed,\ntheir last names may not be included in\nthe report.\nOne of Three files of open foster homes reviewed contained a special evaluation\nreport that did not include documentation of an investigation (interviews,\ndocuments reviewed, etc.) within the report. Additionally, notes attached to the",
    "report documented interviews conducted; however the notes were not clear that a\nlicensing investigation was completed.\nCPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n• (2) An agency shall complete written service\nplans for each child and parent or parents, as\nfollows:\n• (b) Within 120 calendar days after the\ninitial removal and at least once every 90\ncalendar days thereafter.\nOne of Six files of youths currently in foster care placements reviewed contained\ntwo updated service plans not completed timely. One report was completed 1 day\nlate and the other 3 days late.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• R 400.12418(5) - If Parent Agency Treatment Plans are being provided\nelectronically due to courtesy workers making in person contacts, there must\nbe documentation the document was reviewed with all parties. This could be\ndone via video conferencing or by phone, if needed.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• R 400.12418(6) - Uploading worker and supervisor signatures on service\nplans and parent agency treatment plans at the time the documents are\nsigned would prevent the need to locate and upload these documents at the\ntime of inspection.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe one CAP submitted by the agency during the period under review was\nsubmitted in response to the 12/20/24 licensing inspection report and was\napproved on 1/6/2024. That CAP addressed two violations; R 400.12421(2) and R\n400.12413(1(e.) Each of those violations was found in one of the six open foster\ncare files reviewed. The violations were effectively addressed through the CAP as\nevidenced by no repeat violations being established.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator’s assessment dated 8/26/2025 identified areas of\nsignificant compliance such as initial physical exams, periodic well child exams,\ninitial dental exams, worker-child contacts, and return home contacts. Some\nchallenges with compliance identified were sibling visits as there have been large\nsibling groups in which coordinating visits has been challenging as well as social\nwork contact entry. During the entrance meeting, the chief administrator and\nagency leadership identified an increase in child removals throughout the year\nresulting in an increase in caseloads. Additionally, difficulty maintaining stable and\nappropriate placements for youths with aggressive and mental health needs\nresults in workers needing to shift focus from their planned work activities to\nsecuring placements. These factors have put some strain on staff ability to\nmaintain full compliance with all timeframe requirements.\nFinancial Overview\nNot Applicable.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo of the three staff members interviewed started their individual interviews by\nstating they are \"drowning.\" All three of the staff members interviewed reported\nbeing within caseload compliance; however, the caseload numbers are higher\nthan what they typically carry at the agency. The two foster care workers\ninterviewed reported there has been an increase in challenging cases related to\ncourt orders requiring services to be provided in cases where services would not\nhave typically been court ordered. They all reported that, despite the increase in\nworkload, they all feel supported and assisted by management, they reported\nthere is an understanding by supervisors as well as the agency director as to the\ndifficulty completing all tasks timely and assistance is provided when needed.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to provide for the\ndelivery of foster care, independent living, and certification services. Case records\nare stored in a locked file room and closed adoption records are stored within a\ndedicated locked cabinet in a supervisor's office. Physical CHRI is stored in a\nseparate locked cabinet.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns were identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nSeptember 12, 2025\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 12, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager"
