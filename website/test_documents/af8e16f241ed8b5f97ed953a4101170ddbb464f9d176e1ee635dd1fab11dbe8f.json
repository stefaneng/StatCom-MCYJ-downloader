    "ALLEGATION: School teachers, who are contracted with the agency, are\nbeing used at the facility as maintaining staffing ratios and this is in violation\nof PREA.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 12/6/20, I initiated the investigation. I spoke to the complainant and Administrator 1.\nOn 12/10/19, I spoke to Complainant 1. Complainant 1 reported the agency was in\nnoncompliance of PREA standards due to allowing teachers to be counted in the\nstaffing ratio. Complainant 1 reported that the teachers are contractual staff and are not\nemployees of the facility. Complainant 1 stated since they are contractual staff they\ncannot be counted in the staffing ratio as direct care workers.\nOn 12/17/19, I spoke to Administrator 1, Vice President of Residential Programs.\nAdministrator 1 reported teachers are used to provide “line of sight” when needed.\nAdministrator 1 reported that teachers are not scheduled as part of the staffing ratio.\nOn 1/9/20, I spoke to Administrator 2, Program Supervisor. Administrator 2 reported\ntheir program requires a 1:5 staff-to-resident ratio. Administrator 2 reported teachers are\nnot placed on the staffing schedule to supervise residents. Teachers will be designated\nas a second staff to fulfill the staff-to-resident ratio at times. During school, teachers are\nsometimes used in the staffing ratio when one youth care worker will take residents to\nuse the bathroom during school hours and will be used in off grounds school field trips.\nI reviewed the teacher Job Description from Vassar Public Schools. There is not a job\ndescription created for the teachers by Wolverine Vassar House, therefore; the job\ndescription did not list maintaining “line of supervision” of residents in the absence of a\nsufficient number of Wolverine staff members.\nI reviewed the contract between Wolverine Human Services and Vassar Public Schools.\nThe contract states the educational staff will be trained and involved in physical\nrestraints and incident report writing.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4111 Job Description\nAn institution shall provide a job description for each staff\nposition that identifies rules, required qualifications, and\nlines of authority.\n3",
    "ANALYSIS: Vassar House does not have a job description in the teacher’s\npersonnel file. The contract between Wolverine Human Services\nand Vassar Public Schools does not denote teachers can be\nutilized as direct care workers.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff to student ratio\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written\nstaff-to-resident ratio formula for direct care workers\nANALYSIS: Teachers are used in the staff-to-resident ratio at times.\nTeachers do not have a job description that identifies their role\nas being part of the staff-to-resident ratio.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nA. It is recommended the license remain unchanged.\n1/29/20\n________________________________________\nVenus M.
