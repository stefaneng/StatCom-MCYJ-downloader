She reported Foster Care Director 1 (FCD 1) has never\ngiven her permission to sign FCD 1’s name on documents prior to\ntwo Parent Agency Treatment Plans (PATP’s) that needed to be\nsigned for this year’s annual audit. She reported she lives two\nhours away from the agency therefore, when she schedules home\nvisits, she does not return back to the agency when she goes to\nfoster home visits. After her home visits, she goes to her home.\nShe reported the agency was preparing for their agency annual\naudit and she needed to get signatures from a foster home before\n3",
    "the audit that was scheduled to start the next day, early morning.\nShe reported prior, FCD 1 told her to go to the foster home, get\nthe required signatures on the PATP’s and put them on her desk\nfor review. She reported FCD 1 left work early and was not\nreturning back to the office on this day. FCS 1 reported she sent\nFCD 1 an email informing FCD 1 that she was going to get the\nsignatures for the PATP’s, which consists of a youth and his foster\ncare relative and would upload the documents in MiSACWIS.\nFCS 1 reported she informed FCD 1 in an email she sent that she\nwas going to sign FCD’s 1 name on the documents. FCS 1\nreported she also called FCD 1 on the telephone the next day and\ninformed FCD 1 on the telephone to inform the auditor that she\nsigned FCD’s 1 name on the PATP reports. According to the FCS\n1, FCD 1 said “okay”. FCS 1 said she was in the office when she\nmade the telephone call to FCD 1 who was preparing for the\nagency audit. She reported she was talking to FCD 1 on speaker\nphone and that one of her co-workers, FCS 2, overheard the\nconversation. FCS 1 reported she never thought anything would\nhappen as a result of signing FCD 1’s name on the documents.\nShe said the next thing she knew; she was being placed on\nadministrative leave. She said no one explained to her why she\nwas being placed on administrative leave, she was told not to\nreturn back into the office until further notice. FCS 1 reported\nFCD 1 was well aware that she had signed her name on two\nPATP documents that occurred in the same foster home for two\nreporting periods. The PATP’s were dated 11/4/23 – 2/1/24 and\n4/27/24 – 7/22/24. She stated when she worked for the\ndepartment, she had been told it was okay to sign for someone\nand initial it if that person was no longer available (meaning if a\nworker had left the position or no longer worked for the agency).\nFCS 1 admitted she was assigned the case for Foster Child A and\nhis siblings, and she noticed the last worker, FCS 4 did not\ncomplete sibling visit documentation and left the case in a mess.\nShe said with no permission from anyone, she went into\nMiSACWIS and modified the sibling visits social work contacts\nwhich included adding face-to-face contacts. The dates for the\nsibling visits that were added under social work contacts were\n1/20/24, 6/15/24 and 7/20/24. It was discussed with FCS 1 that\nshe was not an employee at Vista Maria during those dates. FCS\n1 responded that Foster Child A and his siblings were on her case\nload, she was now responsible for the case, and she wanted FCD\n1 to pass her audit. FCS 1 reported upon review of Foster Child\nA’s case she observed notes written by FCS 4 regarding sibling\nvisits dates but they were not entered into MiSACWIS for the\nmonths of January, June and July so she added them into the\n4",
    "system. FCS 1 did not have additional information. She stated\nshe resigned from the agency because she did not like the\n“culture.” She said she made a mistake in modifying the SWC’s\nbecause she just did not know.\nInterview with Quality Director via email on 11/14/24. She\nreported she interviewed the Foster Parent via phone along with\nFoster Home Development Supervisor regarding the allegation,\nsignatures on documents and sibling visits.

She reported she was in the office the day of the audit\nand heard FCS 1 telephone conversation with FCD 1. She said\nshe heard FCS 1 inform FCD 1 that she had signed FCD 1’s\nname on PATP documents and to inform the auditor that FCS 1\nsigned the documents for FCD 1. FCS 2 said she heard FCD 1\nrespond, that’s fine. FCS 2 said at the time, she did not think it\nwas an issue or a big deal. She reported she has never signed\nFCD 1 name on any of her documents nor has FCD 1 ever asked\nher to do so. FCS 2 had no additional information. She only\ndiscussed hearing about PATP documents. She did not mention\nor report hearing anything about social work contacts.\nInterview with Program Manager (PM) via telephone on\n11/14/24. She reported FCD 1 informed her that FCS 1 allegedly\nsent her an email informing her she was signing FCD 1’s name on\ndocuments. She said FCD 1 informed PM that she never received\nthe email regarding her signature being signed on documents.\nPM reported she did not discuss with FCD1 what documents she\nwas referring too. PM said this is the only information she has\nreceived on the allegation that FCD 1 had discussed with her.\nShe had no additional information on PATP’s or social work\ncontacts when interviewed.\nInterview with Foster Care Director 1 via video conference on\n11/15/24. She reported that FCS 1 sent her an email saying she\nwas going to get signatures. FCD 1 said FCS 1 did not mention\nwho she was getting signatures for and afterwards, FCS 1 said in\nthe email she was going home. FCD 1 reported FCS 1 did say in\nthe email that she was going to sign FCD 1 name on the\ndocuments and when FCD 1 reported to work the next day, she\ncould review the documents. FCD 1 reported when she reported\nto work the next morning, there were no documents on her desk to\n5",
    "review. FCD 1 said on the second day of the agency DCWL audit,\nFCS 1 brought her several documents (PATP’s) to review and\nsign and that she did sign those documents and met with the\nDCWL Auditor. FCD 1 said she could not identify the date of the\nemail because she no longer had access to her computer as she\nis no longer employed with Vista Maria. FCD 1 reported she could\nnot recall getting a telephone call discussing the signing of PATP\ndocuments from FCS 1. FCD 1 changed her story and reported\nFCS 1 might have called her, but she did not remember, she\nadded, she did say okay to FCS 1 when she sent her the email\nabout signing FCD 1’s name on PATP documents. FCD 1\nreported she had no idea that FCS 1 had entered social work\ncontacts into MiSACWIS. She reported she learned of this\ninformation during the annual audit exit with the DCWL Auditor\nand when FCD 2 pointed it out to her. She had no additional\ninformation to add.\nIt should be noted that a discussion was held with FCD 1\nregarding her inconsistency with her statements regarding the\nemail, and the telephone call from FCS 1 about signing PATP\ndocuments and giving her permission to sign FCD 1’s name on\nthe PATP documents. FCD 1 said it was the best she could\nremember, and she did not have her notes to refer to as they were\nin her computer that she had to return back to Vista Maria as she\nis no longer employed with the agency.\nInterview with Foster Care Director 2 (FCD 2) via telephone\non 11/18/24. FCD 2 reported on 10/1/2024, Vista Maria had their\nDCWL renewal audit and corrective action plan review by DCWL\nAuditor. When DCWL Auditor completed her MiSACWIS audits,\nthere were several cases with missing sibling visits. She reported\none case in particular that was assigned by a worker who no\nlonger worked for the agency (FCS 4) had recent information\ndocumented and inputted for 9/30/2024. FCD 2 said the DCWL\nAuditor reported when she reviewed the case, several sibling\nvisits were missing sibling visits for January, February, April and\nJuly of 2024 from this sibling group.\nFCD 2 said DCWL Auditor pointed out that the sibling visits were\nall added on 9/30/24 by FCS 1. FCD 2 said she spoke up during\nthe audit meeting and stated she was concerned about the validity\nof the sibling visits due to being a member of the quality team.\nShe said she emailed all staff to reconcile contacts on a monthly\nbasis. FCD 2 reported those contacts were previously listed as not\noccurring. FCD 2 said she advised FCD 1 to reach out to the\ncaregivers at the time of placement to determine if the visits\n6",
    "occurred. FCD 2 reported that FCD 1 reported back the caregiver\nconfirmed the sibling visits did occur by FCS 4 but was not\nentered into the system before departing with the agency.\nFCD 2 reported that FCS 1 was called to the board room and\nwhen asked about the sibling visits, she reported Program\nManager told her the dates of the sibling visits and she inputted\nthe information into MiSACWIS as she was now responsible for\nthe case. FCD 2 reported Program Manager shared an email\nverifying that the caregiver had signed the documents, and the\ncaregiver gave the agency permission to contact her directly about\nsigning the documents. FCD 2 explained the caregiver reported\nthe handwriting might look different because she had a stroke and\nher writing was different.\nFCD 2 reported that FCD 1 presented several PATPs for different\nreporting periods to DCWL Auditor. DCWL Auditor reviewed the\nsignatures and signatures for the same caregiver were signed\ndifferently. FCD 2 said DCWL Auditor made a comment about the\nsignatures, which prompted Program Manager to review the other\nPATPs that were subsequently going to be provided to DCWL\nAuditor. FCD 2 reported during Program Manager’s review,\nProgram Manager stated she could tell FCD 1’s signature was not\nsigned by FCD 1. FCD 1 looked at the documents and stated\nsignatures were not signed by her. FCD 2 reported FCD 1 did not\nstate that she told anyone they could sign for her on these PATPs.\nProgram Manager also compared Foster Child A’s signature and\nreported the signature was not familiar to what she had seen from\nthis youth in the past. It is undetermined if Foster Child A’s\nsignature was not his signature. Foster Child A did not make\nhimself available for an interview to answer this question and\nneither FCD1 nor FCS 1 state that FCS 1 signed Foster Child A’s\nsignature on any of the PATP’s that were in question.\nInterview with Foster Home Development Supervisor via\ntelephone on 11/18/24. She reported she knows very little about\nthe allegations. She reported she did interview Foster Parent with\nthe Quality Director, and the Foster Parent confirmed that the\nsibling visits did occur with FCS 4, but that Foster Parent was\nunable to verify the dates or months. She said she has never\nrequired her supervisors to back date forms, nor has she ever had\nthat type of conversation with FCD 1. She had no additional\ninformation.\nInterview with Adoption Supervisor via telephone regarding\nthe allegation on 11/18/24. She reported she has no knowledge\n7",
    "of the allegations and stated it was not best practice to have a\nsubordinate to sign any documents in the supervisor’s place.\nInterview with Foster Care Specialist (FCS 3) via telephone on\n11/18/24. She reported she has no knowledge of the allegation\nand that she has never been placed in a situation where she\nsigned her supervisor’s name on a document. FCS 3 reported if a\ndocument is late or overdue, it’s late and she would take\nresponsibility. No additional information was added.\nInterview with Foster Parent via telephone on 11/20/24. Foster\nParent reported she was unaware of what documents were\nfalsified. She reported she signs many documents, but she did\nnot know what she was signing. She said when the workers come\ninto her home (there had been several workers, no names were\nidentified) asked her to sign documents, she signed her name on\nthe forms/paper. She said she did not have a time period of\nwhen she signed the documents because every time a worker\ncame to her home, she was asked to sign documents. She had no\nadditional information to add, and several people had questioned\nher about signing documents. Foster Parent reported Foster Child\nA visits with his siblings weekly.\nIt is noted that four siblings were placed together in a relative\nfoster home since coming into care. Foster Child A was placed\nfrom his siblings on 8/14/24, into another unrelated foster home.\nHe has weekly sibling visits with his siblings in the relative foster\nhome.\nInterview with DCWL Auditor via telephone on 11/20/24. She\nreported during her exit conference and after reviewing several\ncases, updated services plans and PATP’s dating back to 2023,\nshe discovered there were PATP’s that had just been entered into\nMiSACWIS on 9/30/2024 that appeared to have the same\npenmanship for all needed signatures including the foster parent,\nprevious case worker and supervisor. She said she questioned\nthe validity of the signatures and inquired about the signatures on\nthe documents. She reported that FCD 2 spoke up and reported\nthe documents were not signed previously upon during her\nmonthly quarterly reviews. She reported the previous caseworker\nof that particular case had resigned from the agency and did not\ncomplete the signatures. Another caseworker, FCS 1 was now\nassigned to the case. The DCWL Auditor reported she reviewed\nthe social work contacts of the case in question and discovered\nthe social work contacts were modified by FCS 1 dating back to\n1/20/24.

A call back\nmessage was left. To date, no response.\nEmail that was allegedly written by FCS 1 and sent to FCD 1 was\nnot reviewed due to not being obtained by FCS 1 or FCD 1.

These social work\ncontacts were entered into MiSACWIS on 9/30/2024 by FCS 1.\nFCS 1 reported no one gave her permission to modify the social\nwork contacts. This was now her case, and she wanted FCD 1 to\npass her audit.\nAnalysis The agency is found in violation as the Parent Agency Treatment\nplans (PATP) were uploaded in MiSACWIS on 9/30/24. The\nPATP's were dated 11/4/23 -2/1/23 and 4/27/24 -7/22/24.
