Complainant does not have any further details about\nthe allegations. Complainant is not associated with this facility.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility by\nSecondary Consultant on 1/3/24. Supervisor was working at the\nfacility when Youth A was placed there and when Staff 1 was\nworking at the facility. Supervisor does not recall any complaints\nor concerns regarding the allegations ever being disclosed\npreviously.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at Bellamy Creek\nCorrectional Facility alone by MDHHS Worker on 1/19/24, and\nface to face by this Consultant in conjunction with MDHHS\nWorker on 2/20/24. Youth A reported he resided at the facility in\n2009. While at the facility, Staff 1 was assigned as Youth A’s\nadvocate counselor and would advocate for Youth A in meetings\nto determine if Youth A would be able to move up levels in the\nprogram. Youth A was able to provide a physical description of\nStaff 1 and Staff 1’s first name but could not provide Staff 1’s last\nname. Youth A reported around summer 2010, Staff 1 took him to\nan ice cream shop called Jersey Junction in East Town to get ice\ncream. Youth A reported while Staff 1 was driving, Staff 1 pulled\n2",
    "out his penis and told Youth A to “suck it”. Youth A reported he\ntold Staff 1 no and then Staff 1 pulled into the Family Dollar\nparking lot located on Wealthy Street. Youth A reported Staff 1\ntold him he could drop Youth A’s levels in the program and Youth\nA would be stuck at the facility. Youth A reported he stated he\ndidn’t care and refused to do it. Youth A reported Staff 1 drove to\nthe ice cream shop, purchased ice cream for them, and they\nreturned to the facility. Afterwards, Youth A reported he was\nprevented from going up a level and Staff 1 reported it was\nbecause Youth A talked down to him. Shortly after, Youth A\nreported he received a new advocate. Youth A reported he did not\ndisclose this incident or information to any staff and denied telling\nhis therapist about it because he was too embarrassed. Youth A\nreported he felt if he told his therapist, he would need to work on\nthe issue in counseling before being allowed to leave the facility.\nYouth A reported he also recalled on another occasion, Staff 1\ngrabbed or smacked Youth A’s butt while walking up the stairs at\nthe facility. Youth A reported he smacked Staff 1’s hand away and\ncursed at him. Youth A denied Staff 1 saying anything to him.\nYouth A denied reporting the incident to anyone.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 2/13/24 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported he started working at the\nfacility in fall of 2007 and left in 2012. Staff 1 reported he was an\nadvocate for a handful of youth while at the facility and it was his\njob to document progress about behavioral issues the youth were\nhaving on the unit, educational progress, and compliance with\nrules/policies. Staff 1 reported there was a staff meeting once per\nweek where they held an all staff vote on a merit-based system to\ndetermine which youth would change levels. Staff 1 reported he\nthen switched roles to an activity’s therapist for the last 2 years of\nhis employment. Staff 1 could remember Youth A’s first name, but\nnot his last name and couldn’t recall any other information about\nhim.

Staff 1 reported he never took any youth, including\nYouth A, on an outing for ice cream or to Family Dollar. Staff 1\nreported he never asked Youth A for any sexual favors and never\nthreatened to drop him levels if he didn’t comply. Staff 1 reported\nhe never touched or smacked Youth A on the butt, even in a\nplayful way. Staff 1 reported he understood the boundaries he had\nto have as a part of his role at the facility, and never crossed those\nboundaries or interacted with any youth, including Youth A, in an\ninappropriate way.\n3",
    "DOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Court Summons authored by Attorney dated 12/26/23\noutlines a civil lawsuit against the facility by Youth A. It\nnotes:\no “On or about the summer of 2010, [Staff 1] sexually\nassaulted [Youth A]”.\no “On at least three (3) occasions, [Staff 1] committed\nsimilar sexual assaults against [Youth A]”.\no “[Staff 1] assaulted and battered [Youth A] by, inter\nalia, nonconsensual sex and unwanted touching”.\n• USP Contacts for Youth A note Staff 1 was Youth A’s\nYouth Counselor Advocate from approximately 1/15/10-\n9/3/10. Staff 1 completed an advocate visit with Youth A on\n1/23/10 and completed approximately weekly goal reviews.\nStaff 1 then became an assistant activity’s therapist and\nworked with Youth A and Staff 2 in that capacity\napproximately once per week from approximately 9/8/10-\n3/9/11.\n• USP for Youth A dated 6/12/10-9/10/10 authored by\nTherapist. The report notes Youth A was moved to Level 4\nin the program on 3/31/10. In July 2010, staff noted that\nYouth A continued to struggle with demonstrating empathy\ntoward peers, being disrespectful to peers, and dealing with\nfrustration appropriately. He had been working as Unit\nChore Monitor but was removed from that position due to\nhis frequently acting superior and/or disrespectful to others.\nFrom mid-July to mid-August 2010, Youth A began arguing\nwith staff about consequences. His adult interaction goal\ndropped to 71%. While this was still acceptable, it was a\nsignificant drop from 91% in June and 81% in July. During\nthe same time, his leadership goal dropped from 97% to\n73%. Additionally, his participation in Group\nInitiatives/Activity therapy deteriorated significantly. The\nreport for August indicated that Youth A continued to act\nsuperior to others, was disrespectful to peers less\nphysically capable, sometimes would disengage from the\ngroup, and struggled with responding to staff prompts. Due\nto all these issues, Youth A was moved back to Level 3 on\n8/18/10.\n• Notes from Staff Meeting dated 8/18/10 (unknown author)\nstates “[Youth A]’s behavior on the unit during this report\nperiod seems to have taken a turn for the negative, as\n4",
    "reflected by his goals. He has been consistently\ndisrespectful towards both peers and staff members and\nstruggles to accept direction from nearly any source.\nBecause of this, and in consideration of his abilities, this\nwriter recommends dropping [Youth A] from level four to\nlevel three.”\n• Youth A’s “Off-Grounds Flight Plan” approval slips were\nreviewed. These note the date, time, destination, location,\nand supervisor of Youth A’s off-grounds activities. Youth A\nparticipated in 17 off-grounds activities between 2/17/10-\n12/13/10. None of those activities were to get ice cream\nand none of the activities were supervised by Staff 1.\n• Staff 1 stopped working at the facility in 2012. His\nemployee file was purged in 2019 due to the facility’s\nretention policy of keeping employee files for 7 years.\nLimited files were able to be restored by the facility’s IT\ndepartment, but discipline and training records were unable\nto be restored. According to Staff 1’s annual performance\nevaluations from 2009-2012, there were no concerns\nsurrounding Staff 1 having inappropriate relationships or\nboundaries with any youth.\n• Bethany Christian Services Residential Treatment Program\nSuspected Staff Misconduct Policy (created 4/2/03; revised\n2/25/20) states it is expected staff always respect the\nemotional, physical, and mental boundaries of the\nresidents. It outlines the process for reporting and\ninvestigating staff misconduct, including safety planning\nand additional reporting guidelines, if necessary.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. There is no evidence to support Youth\nA’s claims he was sexually abused by Staff 1. Staff 1 denies he\ntook Youth A, or any other youth, on an outing for ice cream,\ndenies asking Youth A for any sexual favors, and denies\nthreatening to drop Youth A levels in the program if he didn’t\ncomply with sexual favors. Documentation in Youth A’s file notes\nYouth A struggled in the program and was dropped a level in the\nprogram for multiple reasons, which was a decision made during a\nstaff meeting on 8/18/10. In addition, documentation in Youth A’s\nfile does not show any evidence Youth A was taken on any off-\ngrounds outings by Staff 1.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
