    "file did not have a brief summary of the services provided documented in the file,\nand Rule 400.4166 (1)(d) one closed youth file did not have documentation of\nwhat services would be provided by the facility after discharge. The approved CAP\ninvolves the Supervisor/Quality Assurance staff to monitor monthly for due dates\nand completed reports. The Supervisor and Case manager will verify completion\nof discharge summaries within 3 days and continue to monitor for discharge\nsummaries monthly. The Supervisor and Case Manager will also monitor monthly\ndischarge summaries. All the above-mentioned actions involve the Supervisor\nsending out calendar reminders to staff about the need to complete the task.\nDuring this investigation none of these issues were discovered to be in non-\ncompliance. The second correction action plan was in response to the special\ninvestigation 2025SIC0000030 with an approved CAP. The violation involved the\nuse of seclusion of a youth (Rule 400.4162). This CAP involves the retraining of all\nstaff on policy of behavior support and management, retraining on Crisis\nPrevention Institute (CPI) and documentation indicated the training was provided\non 10/1/24, 10/30/24, 1/14/25, 1/15/25, and 1/17/25.

He also identified being the new\nChief Administrator. The facility continues with their contract with Global Refuge to\naccommodate refugee and immigrant foster minors who are unaccompanied under\nthe care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. He reported no restraints during\nthis past year. The Chief Administrator identified the absence of a comprehensive\nand consistent onboarding process which has led to a lack in personnel’s ability to\ngain knowledge thus hindering their ability to provide adequate oversight and set\nclear expectations and priorities. He reported that the facility has outlined and\nimplemented several interventions, action steps and ongoing maintenance efforts\nto foster a culture of accountability. He also reported finding full compliance with the\ntimeliness and professional quality of reports including the discharge summaries\nand service plans. This is a result of the changes put into place for the CAP\nrequired by the renewal licensing inspection. The Chief Administrator reported one\nunplanned discharge since the last inspection. The facility has worked to identify\npotential warning signs and created a plan to enhance services, supervision, and\n4",
