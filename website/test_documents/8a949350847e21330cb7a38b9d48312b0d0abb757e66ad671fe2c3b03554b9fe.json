When they entered the house, SL began saying\nsomeone took Youth C’s Coca-Cola and “we shouldn’t have an\nenvironment where we have thieves and liars” but did not\nspecifically call anyone thieves and liars. Youth G reported after\nno one admitted to taking the Coca-Cola, SL searched their rooms\nand found many things other youth were hiding in their rooms (i.e.\nboxes of cereal and other food), which is not allowed. Youth G\nreported SL took these items and other youth were upset the\nitems were found and taken from them. Youth G reported he didn’t\nsubmit a grievance about the situation because he didn’t feel like\nSL did anything inappropriate. Later in the day, Youth F left his\nchips on the couch and SL said, “go get your chips because\nyou’re going to be crying if someone takes them”. Youth G\nreported SL never called Youth F a “crybaby” or “crying baby” but\nwas trying to explain to Youth F he would be upset if someone\ntook his chips the same way Youth C’s Coca-Cola was taken.\nYouth G reported SL apologized to Youth F afterwards.

Youth H reported Youth A, Youth C and\nYouth E are frequently taking things from others, but pretend they\nnever did anything. Youth H reported one of them previously took\nanother youth’s Coca-Cola and hid it prior to this situation. Youth\nH reported SL again nicely asked all the youth who took the Coca-\nCola, but no one responded. Youth H reported SL explained how\nit wasn’t fair for someone to take another person’s Coca-Cola\nbecause it’s only given to each of them as a treat once per week.\nYouth H reported SL was being strict and redirecting the youth so\nthey would listen and respond but was not mean or rude to\nanyone. Youth H reported SL tried to help the youth reflect on\nwhat happened by explaining how if someone begin taking little\n4",
    "things, sometimes that turns into taking bigger things, and then\nyou might be considered thieves. Youth H reported SL never\ncalled any of them “thieves or liars” and was only trying to get\nthem to reflect and teach them what could happen if their\nbehaviors continued.

Youth H reported he doesn’t want to\ndefend anyone, but feels the other youth are being unfair in\naccusing SL of abusing them or offending them just because they\ndon’t like her and don’t like how she redirects them or teaches\nthem. Youth H reported he doesn’t want to see anyone lose their\njob for teaching youth the difference between right and wrong.\nYouth I was interviewed face to face at the facility on 10/3/25.\nYouth I reported a Coca-Cola went missing and SL became upset.\nYouth I reported SL asked the youth to return the Coca-Cola but\nno one responded, so SL began searching rooms and told them\nthey wouldn’t be able to have Coca-Colas in the future. Youth I\nreported SL told all the youth they were thieves and liars, but he\nwasn’t sure if she was trying to get them to reflect by saying if they\ntook things they would be considered thieves and liars, or if she\nwas being mean. Youth I reported he was in the other room and\ndidn’t know her intentions. Youth I reported SL saw Youth F left\nhis bag of chips on the couch and told Youth F if he didn’t keep his\nthings close, he would be crying if it was taken.

    "on top of the kitchen counter. Shortly later, Youth C told SL his\nCoca-Cola was missing and someone must have taken it. Staff 1\nreported SL asked all the youth if they took the Coca-Cola from\nthe kitchen. Staff 1 reported all the youth were ignoring SL and not\nresponding even though SL asked them multiple times. Staff 1\nreported SL turned off the TV and electronics so the youth could\npay attention to what she was saying. Staff 1 reported when SL\ngot their attention, she asked all the youth where the Coca-Cola\nwas and said this shouldn’t be happening inside the house. Staff 1\nreported the youth all responded they didn’t take Youth C’s Coca-\nCola. Staff 1 reported SL proceeded to tell them they would stop\nbeing given Coca-Cola on Saturdays if youth were going to steal\nthem from each other because it’s not fair. Staff 1 reported SL\nsaid, “this behavior is something you shouldn’t do here because\nyou shouldn’t behave like thieves”. Staff 1 reported SL conducted\nroom searches since the youth continued to deny anyone took the\nCoca-Cola. Staff 1 reported during room searches SL found 7\nboxes of cereal and a fishing pole in Youth A’s room. Staff 1\nreported since she found objects in Youth A’s room he wasn’t\nsupposed to have, she continued searching all their rooms. Staff 1\nreported she assisted with room searches per SL’s request. Staff\n1 reported SL was a little upset about the situation because this\nisn’t the first time things have gone missing, and they’ve talked\nabout not taking each other’s belongings. Staff 1 reported SL was\nbeing strict but wasn’t yelling or being mean to the youth. Staff 1\nreported SL did not call the youth “thieves” but simply provided an\nexample that taking something that doesn’t belong to them is the\nbehavior of a thief. Staff 1 reported she did not hear SL call any\nyouth liars. Staff 1 reported she did not hear SL have a\nconversation with Youth F about his bag of chips or call him any\nnames. Staff 1 reported SL could have handled the situation more\npositively, however, due to the repeated concern about stealing\nother people’s belongings, Staff 1 understands why SL was\nfrustrated.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 10/17/25. Staff 2 reported\non Saturday Youth A, Youth F, Youth G and Youth H were inside\nwhile the rest of the youth were outside. Staff 2 reported she was\noutside with the youth but came inside to use the restroom. Staff 2\nreported when she came inside, she saw a Coca-Cola on the\ncounter. However, when Staff 2, SL and all the youth came inside\nshe saw the Coca-Cola was no longer there. Staff 2 reported SL\nbegan asking all the youth who took it, and no one took\nresponsibility or admitted they had it. Staff 2 reported SL said she\nwould check rooms to find it if no one returned it. Staff 2 reported\nno one came forward or returned it, therefore SL began checking\n6",
    "rooms. Staff 2 reported the youth became mad because SL found\nmany food items in their rooms they shouldn’t have, and the youth\ndidn’t want the food items taken from them. Staff 2 reported Youth\nA acted very rude towards SL, as he began slamming stuff\naround, and began kicking pillows in the living room. Staff 2\nreported SL spoke separately with Youth A and Youth F, but she\nwasn’t a part of those conversations and didn’t know what was\nsaid. Staff 2 reported at no point did SL call the youth “thieves or\nliars”, but she did explain to all the youth they shouldn’t take things\nthat don’t belong to them. Staff 2 reported SL was not rude, yelling\nor aggressive towards the youth at any point during the\nconversation. Staff 2 reported the youth didn’t like being\nredirected, but SL did everything appropriately.\nShift Leader (SL) was interviewed via phone on 10/15/25. SL\nreported on the evening of 9/27/25, all the youth received Coca-\nColas and bags of chips. Some youth chose to go outside, and a\nfew youth stayed inside. SL reported she was outside with the\nyouth and when they all came back inside, Youth C’s Coca-Cola\nwas not on the kitchen counter where he said he left it. SL\nreported Staff 2 had come in to use the restroom and confirmed it\nwas on the kitchen counter when she came in approximately 10\nminutes earlier. SL reported the youth frequently prank each\nother, so she said, “guys, whoever took the soda, now is not the\ntime to play around, please give the soda back”. SL reported\nYouth C said it wasn’t right how some youth were always taking\nthings and then the youth were arguing about prior things that had\ngone missing. SL asked them all to turn off the electronics and\nstop playing pool so they could have a conversation. SL reported\nshe explained they all needed to respect each other’s boundaries\nand property, and she reiterated the house rules. SL reported she\nnever called any youth “thieves or liars”, but she did state they\ncannot steal or take things from each other or other people\nbecause then people might think they’re thieves. SL admitted she\nspoke in a stern voice and expressed disappointment, but she\nnever raised her voice, yelled, or was mean to any of them. SL\nreported she wouldn’t call any of them names, and she even\nstopped them from calling each other names and blaming each\nother when they were arguing. SL reported about 10 minutes later\nshe released them back to their activities and encouraged them to\ncome forward in the future if they didn’t feel comfortable doing so\nin that meeting. SL reported after the meeting, Youth A called her\noutside to talk, and he wanted to know why they were trying so\nhard to find out who took the soda. SL told him it was important to\neach of the youth to get a treat, and it was unfair for someone not\nto get their treat because someone else took it from them. SL\n7",
    "reported Youth A said, “[Youth C] is always a troublemaker so why\ndo you even care?”. SL reported she explained to Youth C it\ndoesn’t matter who it was, they all deserve to have their\nbelongings and not have them stolen. SL reported Youth A was\nvery upset and said he felt people were playing favorites, so he\nwas going to write a complaint.\nSL reported after that, she saw Youth F left his chips on the couch\nand they had recently had a conversation about keeping track of\nyour belongings so no one would take them. SL reported earlier in\nthe day someone had taken one of his pieces of candy he left out\nand he was really upset, so she told him he better grab his chips,\nor he would be upset again if someone took them. SL reported\nwhen she told Youth F that, another youth (she didn’t know who)\nmumbled something under their breath to the extent of “yeah, pick\nit up before someone snitches and you start crying”. SL reported\nshe reminded all the youth not to name call because it wasn’t nice\nto do so.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident Reports dated 9/29/25 noted youth grievance\ninformation:\no Youth A’s grievance stated, “Second shift lead called\nus all “rateros (thieves)”.\no Youth B’s grievance stated, “[SL] said we are\nthieves. She checked our rooms, and I don’t like\nanybody checking our rooms”.\no Youth C’s grievance stated, “On 9/27/25, we were\noutside, and I left my coke on the table and when I\ncame back for my coke, I couldn’t find it anymore so\nI told [SL] and she gathered us all and told us that\nwe were thieves and stealers because of the coke\nand I didn’t like that”.\no Youth D’s grievance stated, “[SL] called us thieves\nand liars, and she started to yell at us different\nthings”.\no Youth E’s grievance stated, “[SL] called us thieves\nand liars, and she started to yell at us and say many\nthings.”\n• Code of Conduct Policy and Acknowledgment states staff\nwill not engage in or permit discriminatory treatment or\nharassment of anyone – especially children – for any\nreason. SL signed this acknowledgment on 5/8/25.\n8",
    "• Behavioral Management Policy states youth must never be\nsubjected to corporal or other punishment, including\nhumiliation, mental abuse, or punitive interference with\ndaily functions of living.\n• SL had two disciplinary actions in her employee file\nunrelated to this investigation.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as per interviews conducted\nthere is not enough information to support SL was derogatory,\ndiscriminating, or humiliating in her language or actions towards\nyouth. Interviews with Youth G, Youth H, Staff 1 and Staff 2\nsupported SL may have said the words “thieves”, “liars” or “crying\nbaby/crybaby”, but only to describe actions or define the word\ndescribing taking items not belonging to them, not admitting\nresponsibility for doing so, and how someone would be upset if\ntheir item was taken. There is not enough information to support\nthese words were said in a malicious way, but rather a way to\nteach, explain and redirect inappropriate behaviors. It is also\nbelieved there may be some language barriers by way of words or\nmessages being misinterpreted due to different dialects being\nspoken.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nOctober 28, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 29, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n9"
