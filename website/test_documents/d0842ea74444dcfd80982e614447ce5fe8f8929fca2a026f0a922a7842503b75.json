Youth A stated Therapist and Operations\nManager had spoken with him shortly after he filed this grievance.\nYouth A was not sure if his bedroom was changed as a result of\nthis conversation.

He\nstated that he did not perform a PREA investigation for this\n2",
    "original incident in November 2023 because it did not meet the\nrequirements for doing so, namely that this was not a repeated\ninstance of accused sexual harassment at that point in time. The\nOperations Manager confirmed that he was not on campus when\nthis accusation was made by Youth A, and he knew the issue was\naddressed by other staff. The Operations Manager also recalled\nhe was the only trained PREA investigator for the facility at that\ntime, but since then two additional staff have been trained with\none more almost finished with the training.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed during a face-to-face\nvisit at the facility on 05/06/2024. Documentation was provided\nregarding the previous grievance and facility policy.

The\nyouth or family member that filed the grievance will\nreceive a written response within five days of\nreceiving the grievance.\no The facility Freedom from Sexual\nHarassment/Abuse policy stated there is a zero\ntolerance policy of the sexual assault/rape of clients\nwithin the program.
