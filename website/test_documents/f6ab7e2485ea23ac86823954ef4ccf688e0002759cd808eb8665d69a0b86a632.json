No findings.\n03/03/2022 Contact – Document Received\nEmails exchanged with Youth A’s Foster Care Worker and DHHS\nSpecialist 2.\nALLEGATION:\nYouth A has been inappropriately touched by Youth B in a cottage at the facility.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 01/07/22 and investigated jointly with DHHS\nSpecialist and DHHS Specialist 2 (who took over for the initial DHHS Specialist).\nThe original allegations are as follows,\nYouth A (16) and an unknown male peer (age unknown) stay in a cottage\ntogether at the Methodist Children's Home. A male resident, that shares a\ncottage with Youth A, has been touching Youth A inappropriately when they are\nin their cottage. No details are known regarding where the male peer has been\ntouching Youth A inappropriately or for how long this has been going on. It is\nunknown if there are cameras in the cottage they reside in that would catch the\nmale peer's actions towards Youth A. The staff at Methodist Children's Home is\nnot aware of what the male peer is doing to Youth A. However, this is concerning\nas Youth A's behaviors have been calm until recently as Youth A intentionally\nscratched himself with an unknown object the other day. The staff at Methodist\nChildren's Home, his therapist, and Foster Care Worker are aware Youth A\nintentionally scratched himself and are addressing this issue with him.\nI interviewed the complainant on 01/10/22 via phone. The complainant clarified that\nadditional information was reported by Youth A during a home visit and the\ninformation was passed on to the complainant. Reportedly Youth B was identified as\nthe youth who was touching Youth A and the two youth know one another from a\nprior placement.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Worker (FCW) via phone on 01/10/22. The FCW\nreported knowledge of the complaint and that Youth B was identified as the peer\nwho was allegedly touching Youth A. The FCW said that Youth A might have\nconfusion about what is appropriate given his cognitive level of about a seven- or\neight-year-old, or a second grader. The FCW said that Youth A’s trauma history\nmight skew his perception of what is appropriate or current, as well. The Methodist\ntherapist is currently working with Youth A about sexual and gender issues. She\ndidn’t have anything else to add. During a follow-up phone interview with the FCW,\non 01/20/22, the FCW said that she met with Youth A the day prior, and he reported\n5",
    "that Youth B slaps him in the arm and head. Reportedly, Youth A has told the staff\nabout this, but Youth B has continued to slap Youth A. Youth A reported nothing else\nis happening.\nPhone and email contacts with the DHHS Specialist were made until the case\nassignment was transferred to DHHS Specialist 2. The first Specialist reported that\nshe had attempted to schedule a forensic interview for Youth A, but the appointment\nwas postponed multiple times for various reasons. Both Specialists reported that a\nlaw enforcement notification was sent but was not going to be investigated unless\nYouth A disclosed a weapon was involved during his forensic interview.\nI interviewed Youth A with DHHS Specialist 2, on 01/24/22, at the facility related to\nthe medication and medical allegations outlined later in this report, but we did not\ninterview him related to this allegation as we were waiting for the forensic interview.\nYouth A appeared clean and did not have any noticeable marks or injuries. He\nconfirmed that he changed cottages recently and noted things are going well.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 02/16/22, jointly with DHHS Specialist 2.\nYouth B reported that he feels safe at the facility and gets along with other youth and\nthe staff. Youth B reported that he gets enough to eat, and meals often include\nvegetables. Youth B said that he “loves messing with people” as he proceeded to\nput things on my papers, played with DHHS Specialist 2’s phones, and messed with\nthe hand sanitizer on the table. Youth B said that he gets along with Youth A and\nnoted that they were in a previous placement together as well. Youth B denied\nhitting other kids and said he would only hit someone if he felt threatened. He denied\nhaving fights with or hitting Youth A.\nI interviewed Staff 3 and Staff 4 at the facility on 02/16/22, jointly with DHHS\nSpecialist 2. Both staff reported having worked in the cottage with Youth A and\nYouth B prior to them being separated. Both staff said that Youth B actively\nhorseplays and touches/hits Youth A (and other kids) but neither reported this to be\naggressive or hurtful. The staff try to redirect Youth B, which is sometimes\nsuccessful, but Youth B periodically continues to horseplay. Neither staff reported\nYouth B to hit Youth A aggressively. Neither staff reported witnessing any sexualized\ntouching between the two youth.\nI interviewed Youth C and Youth D at the facility on 02/16/22, jointly with DHHS\nSpecialist 2. Both youth reported feeling safe at the program and both were familiar\nwith Youths A and B. Youth C reported no horseplay, no youth hitting one another\nand no youth intentionally aggravating one another. The only youth who was\nidentified as bothering him, was a different peer that Youth C reported to be “gay.”\nYouth D reported that some youth horseplay, including one peer and Youth B. Youth\nD said that Youth B will poke or tap other kids, touches kids without permission (not\nsexually), always asks people for a fist bump, and will sometimes intentionally stand\nin others’ way. Youth D said it doesn’t bother him now but was aggravating initially.\nYouth D said that no one is hurting anyone, and Youth B doesn’t seem to be doing\n6",
    "these things to hurt others. Youth D added that staff do intervene and tell Youth B to\nstop and sometimes he stops but will usually do something again the next day.\nI received the notes from Youth A’s forensic interview, on 02/28/22, from DHHS\nSpecialist 2. Per the health and safety regulations of the organization conducting the\ninterview, I was not allowed to attend the interview that occurred on 02/10/22. DHHS\nSpecialist 2’s summary of the interview noted no report by Youth A of being hit,\ntouched, or otherwise harmed at the facility. Youth A was able to differentiate\nbetween appropriate/good touching and inappropriate/bad touching. He reported\nfeeling safe at the facility and noted that staff are there to keep the children safe.\nYouth A said that he only feels unsafe if kids are fighting and noted that staff\nintervene to stop this from occurring. Youth A also reported in the interview that he\nfeels safe with the other residents and has never felt unsafe.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation includes:\n Safety plans for both Youth A and Youth B were developed and provided by\nthe facility. Youth A moved to another cottage and the two were to be kept\nseparated. Staff were to increase line of sight supervision pending the\ninvestigation. Signed by the Clinical Director and dated 01/20/22.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: The facility is compliant with the rule as there is no evidence that\nstaff are not sufficiently supervising youth and allowing Youth A\nto be inappropriately touched or hit. This was not supported by\nthe interviews, including Youth A’s forensic interview.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth A’s medical and medication needs are not being met at the facility. Youth B\nhas missed one medication and Youth X is overdue for a dental exam.\nINVESTIGATION:\nAdditional allegations were received on 01/20/22 and added to this investigation.\nThese allegations were investigated jointly with DHHS Specialist 2. The allegations\nwere as follows,\nYouth A has diabetes. Since 12/28/2021, Youth A's blood sugar has been high.\nOn 12/28/2021, Youth A's blood sugar was 374. Youth A's blood sugar has been\nabove 150 since 12/28/2021. Youth A's endocrinologist provided a diabetic\nhotline that the staff should utilize if Youth A's blood sugar goes above 150. The\nstaff has not been utilizing the hotline. It is unknown if Youth A has been\nimpacted negatively. Youth A’s cardiologist also provided a specific diet for the\nstaff to follow. The staff have not been following the recommendations of the\ncardiologist. The facility did receive the dietary recommendation; however, they\ndid not follow the recommendation because it did not come from a nutritionist.\nNot following the recommended diet could have a significant impact on Youth A’s\nhealth and may be a contributing factor in Youth A’s blood sugar not being under\ncontrol. In addition, Youth A has not been receiving his medication as prescribed.\nYouth A has been allowed to leave the facility without his insulin and Youth A has\nalso missed medical appointments. There is an overall concern for Youth A’s\nhealth as diabetes is a serious medical condition that has to be appropriately\nmanaged to avoid detrimental outcomes. There are several other youth at\nMethodist Children's Home that are not receiving the appropriate amount of\nmedical care as well.\nOn 01/20/22, Consultant 2 forwarded information, via email, related to the\nallegations of the “other youth” noted in the complaint. It was alleged that Youth B\nwas sent on a home pass without one of his medications and Youth X had a late\ndental exam.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Worker (FCW) via phone on 01/10/22. The FCW\nreported that Youth A was due for a dental exam in December, but it was still not\ndone. The FCW said that Youth A’s facility case manager has advised her that he\nhas an appointment set for tomorrow. The FCW said that Youth A was supposed to\nhave a cardiologist appointment set up months ago, but due to delays with the\nfacility, the FCW is setting up and taking Youth A to these appointments herself. The\nFCW said that medical follow-up appears to have “fallen apart” since the former\nnurse left the facility. During a follow-up phone interview with the FCW, on 01/20/22,\nthe FCW said that she found out the day prior, from the Therapist, that Youth A’s\nblood sugar levels have been high. The FCW said that the Therapist reported that\nshe would remind the staff what they are supposed to do. The FCW said that the\n8",
    "dental exam was finally done but Youth A didn’t get a cleaning, just an exam, per the\nrecord. Regarding Youth A’s cardiology appointment, the FCW said that she makes\nthose appointments and made an appointment for February. The FCW will also take\nYouth A to this appointment. Additionally, the FCW said that she made an\nappointment for Youth A to go to the diabetes clinic March 10, 2022, and noted she\nwill take him to that appointment also.\nI exchanged emails with Youth B’s Foster Care Worker, on 01/20/22, related to the\nallegation of him missing medication during a home pass. This Foster Care Worker\nclarified the allegation and reported, “Youth B visited the foster home of the former\nfoster parents this past weekend and yesterday they mentioned he did not have all\nmedication for weekend. I reached out this morning for clarification. The foster dad,\nresponded, ‘1 morning med. Youth B wasn’t sure what it was, and we do not receive\na medication list, so I am not sure either. It was not his lithium’.”\nI interviewed the Therapist at the facility on 01/24/22, jointly with DHHS Specialist 2.\nThe Therapist has worked with Youth A since June of 2021.The Therapist denied\nthat the facility or cottage provides youth with many sugary items. She reported that\nYouth A told the Therapist he was “feeling off” and thinking that his medication might\nneed adjusting. When the Therapist reviewed Youth A’s blood sugar levels, she\nnoticed they were high, particularly with the colder weather arriving and Youth A\nbeing inside more and less active. The Therapist said that the school was not aware\nYouth A was diabetic but noted that they should have been. Per the Therapist, Youth\nA has been getting sugary items from school and from the nearby gas station, as\nwell as from his grandparents during home visits. The Therapist said that she has\nrelayed this information to the doctor. Youth A takes Metformin for his diabetes and\nwas just recently prescribed insulin as well. The Therapist said that she\ncommunicates regularly with Youth A and his Foster Care Worker about his diet and\nhow to manage his diabetes. The Therapist said that she reviews the logs for Youth\nA’s blood sugar and contacts the Foster Care Worker if there’s an issue. Due to\nYouth A’s consistently high blood sugar levels they implemented a medical safety\nplan as well. The Therapist said that she was not aware the FCW wanted them to\ncall a hotline until the FCW sent the endocrinology report last week. The Therapist\nsaid that the hotline number, the FCW’s number, and the medical safety plan are all\nin Youth A’s cottage now. Regarding home visits, the Therapist said that the staff\npack the medications and send them. When asked who facilitates Youth A’s\nendocrinology appointments and cardiology appointments, the Therapist stated it\nwas the FCW. The Therapist said that the facility Nurse coordinates dental\nappointments. The Therapist recalled Youth A missed one dental exam, about two\nweeks ago, when he had to get picked up as his attorney showed up unannounced\nat the facility to meet with him.\nI interviewed Youth A with DHHS Specialist 2, on 01/24/22, at the facility. Youth A\nentered the room with a shoebox that he was carrying with him. Youth A showed us\nthat the box contained Reese’s peanut butter cups, M&Ms, and cookies. Youth A\nreported that he received the Reese’s from friends at school, the M&Ms from\n9",
    "Director 3, and the cookies were from his grandmother and brought back from his\nvisit with his grandparents. Youth A continued to eat candy throughout the interview,\neven while acknowledging that he is not supposed to, as he is diabetic. Youth A\nreported he was on a home pass over the weekend with his grandparents and ate a\nburger, onion rings, and spaghetti. Youth A said that he does test his blood sugar\nand said it will be high if he’s eating candy. Youth A tests his blood himself and staff\nrecords the reading. Youth A was asked about his medication and reported that he\nreceives all his medications. He said that one time he went home on a visit and\nthinks he missed one medication. Youth A couldn’t recall what medication or when\nthis occurred, noting it was likely in the fall or winter. If his blood sugar levels are\nhigh, he is instructed to drink more water and retest. Youth A said that he also tests\nhis blood sugar during his home visits, either with his own meter or with his\ngrandmother’s. Youth A said that he is not on a special diet yet. Youth A reported\nthat he usually eats fried food and stated that there is not much healthy food at the\nfacility, like salads or vegetables. When asked about his exercise, Youth A reported\nthat there are options available to him at the facility (such as sports and gym time)\nand that staff encourage him to participate in physical activity, but Youth A refuses\nas he doesn’t like exercising. Youth A acknowledged that his doctors want him to\nexercise but he doesn’t want to and stated that he is not going to.\nI interviewed Director 3 at the facility on 01/24/22, jointly with DHHS Specialist 2. I\nasked Director 3 if she provided Youth A with some candy M&Ms. Director 3 said\nthat she was talking to Youth A, who had come in her office while she was eating\ncandy, and she offered him some candy as well. Director 3 apologized for the error\nand said that she just wasn’t thinking about his diabetes, but she is usually mindful.\nI interviewed Staff 1 and Staff 2 at the facility on 01/24/22, jointly with DHHS\nSpecialist 2. Both staff reported regular testing of Youth A’s blood sugar and logging\nof the results. It was further reported that staff will either advise the supervisor or log\nthe numbers in the log if very high. Both staff stated the Nurse checks the\ndocumentation of the blood sugar checks. Both staff reported that Youth A often\nbrings back candy and “junk” from home passes and from school and hides it. Both\nstaff reported that they, and other staff, encourage Youth A to make better eating\nchoices, but Youth A continues to eat things he is not supposed to have. Both staff\nreported that Youth A has access to exercise options. Staff 1 said that Youth A\nrefuses to participate in gym time or physical activity. Staff 2 said that Youth A plays\nguitar and walks around. Both staff reported that Youth A gets the same dinner as\nthe other youth. Meals are sent over by the kitchen staff to the cottages. Staff 1 said\nthat there are not always vegetables at dinner, but she tries to find some at the\ncottage to add to the meal if there are not vegetables included. Staff 2 said that there\nare vegetables every day in the youth’s meals and some others at the cottages as\nwell.\nI interviewed Staff 3 and Staff 4 at the facility on 02/16/22, jointly with DHHS\nSpecialist 2. Both staff have assisted Youth A in testing his blood sugar and\ndispensing medications. Staff 3 said that his levels have been high. When that\n10",
    "occurs, staff are to tell the Nurse and give him water. Staff 4 said that Youth A\nsometimes refuses medications. Staff 4 said when his blood sugar tests high the\nstaff lets the on-call supervisor know and the supervisor calls the Nurse, who may\nthen come to see the youth. Both staff reported that Youth A sneaks candy and\nsweets into the cottage and sneaks extra snacks from the kitchen. The staff do\nsearches and do confiscate items if the youth are not supposed to have it.\nI met with Director 1 on 02/16/22, jointly with DHHS Specialist 2. Director 1 reported\nthat Youth A’s FCW makes the appointments for Youth A for his cardiologist and\nendocrinologist and also takes Youth A to those appointments. Director 1 said that\nthere was not a prescribed diet for Youth A, although recommendations/suggestions\nwere made.\nIn follow-up emails with Youth A’s FCW on 03/02/22, she reported that she provided\nthe facility a book that included blood glucose testing instructions for Youth A and a\nlist of contacts for the doctor office if Youth A tests over 200. The book and nutrition\ninformation were reportedly provided to the Nurse on 1/26/2022. I asked the FCW\nwhen the diet recommendations were provided to the facility and she replied that the\nfacility Nurse and Family Transition Coordinator now have the recommendations and\nnoted that she was going to take the diet paperwork to the facility on 03/02/22, along\nwith blood testing forms that must be completed in May and August. The FCW said\nthat it was the Family Transition Coordinator who advised her that the facility does\nnot follow dietary recommendations unless it is from a nutritionist. The FCW said\nthat Youth A was prescribed the Insulin on 01/21/2022 but noted that the facility did\nnot receive the medication until after 01/26/2022. The FCW added that additional\nchanges were made at the endocrinologist appointment at 01/26/22.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation includes:\n Youth A’s dental records were reviewed. It was observed that he was seen on\nthe following dates:\no 04/29/21-exam, x-rays, cleaning; needs fillings\no 05/18/21-fillings received\no 01/18/21-exam, x-rays\n Youth A’s medication administration records for January 2022:\no Several medications were observed as not having documentation of\nadministration for various days. It appears at least one dose of six\ndifferent medications was not documented as having been dispensed\nto Youth A on at least one occasion during the month. There were no\nstaff initials in the box to record having administered the medication\nand there was no reason code or exception noted for why the\nmedication was missed (i.e., refused, provided to family for home visit,\netc.)\n Youth A’s medication administration record for December 2021 was reviewed\nspecifically for glucose testing. It was observed that three days omitted\ndocumentation of testing and did not record a reason for not testing. It\n11",
    "appears these day incidents were during home passes and staff did not\ndocument all of them as such, however, others contained this documentation.\n Youth X’s dental records were reviewed. It was observed that he was seen on\nthe following dates and appears current on his dental needs:\no 06/09/21-exam, x-rays, cleaning and referred to orthodontist\no 06/25/21-orthodontist exam; no treatment needed\no 12/20/21-exam, x-rays, cleaning, fluoride; needs dental fill\no 01/11/22-dental fillings under local anesthesia\n Youth B’s medication administration records for the weekend of 1/14-1/16/22.\nThe records showed that Youth B was prescribed two morning medications,\nLithium and Vitamin D3. The documentation showed that the Lithium was\nprovided to the family for the duration of the home pass but did not outline the\nVitamin D3 for 1/15/22 and 1/16/22. It was additionally observed on the\nJanuary medication administration record for January 2022, that Youth A was\nnoted by staff to be out of medication on 01/07/22 and 01/08/22 for three\npsychotropic medications. Vitamin D3 was also documented by the staff to be\nout of refills on January 9, 11, 22, and 23.\n Youth A’s medical safety plan, developed with Youth A’s Foster Care Worker,\ndated 01/19/22. The plan was signed by the facility Therapist on 01/14/22\nwith notes that it was reviewed and updated 01/19/22 and 01/21/22. It was\nsigned by the Nurse on 01/19/22.

Youth A had a dental exam on 04/29/21 and did not\nreceive another dental until 01/18/22. Youth are to receive\ndental every six months and Youth A was almost three months\nlate when he received the January exam. Additionally, a review\nof documentation in December specific to blood glucose testing\nfor Youth A found that there were three days with no\ndocumentation of testing and no reason for not testing. Although\nit appears these incidents were during Youth A’s home passes,\n13",
    "the facility must ensure proper documentation and reasons for\nnot testing (i.e., refused, on a home pass).\nRegarding the allegations that Youth X was overdue for a dental\nexam, the facility is compliant with the rule. The documentation\nprovided shows that Youth X has received appropriate dental\nexams, cleanings, x-rays, follow up care for orthodontist\nexamination, and dental fillings.\n(e) In regard to the allegations that Youth A was not receiving\nhis insulin, the facility is compliant. The documentation and\ninterviews show that the complaint was made prior to Youth A\nbeing prescribed the insulin. This was verified by the facility\ndocumentation and in the report from Youth A’s Foster Care\nWorker. Administration of insulin began 01/28/22. The facility is\nnoncompliant with the medication dispensing rule, however, as\na review of Youth A’s medication administration record for\nJanuary 2022 found that the facility did not document dispensing\nevery prescribed dose of medication for Youth A. Six different\nmedications were observed to have missing documentation for\nat least one dose during the month of January. The facility also\nviolated the rule as it was found that the allegation that Youth B\nwas sent home for a visit without one of his morning\nmedications was true. In this case, there was no documentation\nof the facility providing the Vitamin D3 for 01/15/22 and\n01/16/22. This is consistent with the report made by Youth B’s\nFoster Care Worker that Youth B was missing one of his\nmorning medications during that weekend home pass. Finally,\nYouth B’s record showed he was out of medication or refills for\nvarious medications during the month. The facility is responsible\nfor ensuring youth have prescribed medications onsite and\navailable.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0207014 - intake 12/21/21; CAP approved 02/24/22\n2022C0207012 - intake 12/08/21; CAP approved 03/03/22\n2022C0207007 - intake 11/16/21; CAP approved 02/24/22\n2022C0108004 - intake 11/04/21; CAP approved 12/01/21\n2021C0219034 - intake 04/26/21; CAP approved 06/15/21\n2021C0219016 - intake 12/04/20; CAP approved 03/01/21\n2020C0108024 - intake 01/22/20; CAP approved 02/19/20\n14",

There\nwere recommendations for lifestyle improvements, which\nincluded Youth A eating a healthier diet, however, it was not\nprescribed until after the complaint was made.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe facility is advised to have unlimited fruits and vegetables on\nhand and available for youth, specifically Youth A, at the\ncottages. Additionally, sugar free snack options should be\navailable as well, especially for diabetic youth. Vegetables are to\nbe included daily per nutritional guidelines as well.
