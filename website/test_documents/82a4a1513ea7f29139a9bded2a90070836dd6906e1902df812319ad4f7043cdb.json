INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nSection (1) An agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nDescription parenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the following:\n1",
    "(a) A plan of visitation for each child in foster care consistent\nwith the child’s service plans, as required by R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420 to assure the safety and wellbeing of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Despite evidence that the mother put the children at risk by\nexposing them to assault and weapons, the agency permitted\nvisits between the mother and children at the home.\nInvestigation\nDHHS Supervisor/Complainant was interviewed via Teams on\n4/13/2023. She reported she supervised the worker who\ninvestigated an October 2022 incident during which Parent A &\nRelative A showed up at Parent B’s home with a knife, guns, and\nbrass knuckles and assaulted Parent B’s girlfriend. Foster Care\nSupervisor and Foster Care worker were made aware of the\ninvestigation concerns and findings. DHHS Supervisor stated\nthere were also multiple criminal charges filed as a result of the\nincident, which are still pending. Additionally, during a police raid\nafter the incident, multiple weapons, including semi-automatic\nfirearms stored in a closet, were located in Relative A’s home.\nDHHS Supervisor stated Youth A & Youth B reported where the\nsemi-automatic weapons were kept. DHHS Supervisor reported\nthere were multiple meetings and interactions with the agency\nstaff throughout and after the investigation.\nDHHS Supervisor reported DHHS worker and Foster Care Worker\nplanned to remove the youths from Relative A’s home after the\nincident. DHHS worker and Foster Care Worker went to Relative\nA’s home to move the children and Relative A attempted to take\noff with the children in her car. DHHS worker used her car to block\nRelative A and the police arrived after which the children were\nremoved from Relative A and placed with Relative B.\nDHHS Supervisor stated agency staff have told her Parent A\nrefuses to go to the agency for her visits and Relative B can no\nlonger have the visits at her home, so the visits started to take\nplace at Relative A’s home. During a visit at that home on\n4/3/2023 which was being supervised by Case Aide, Relative A\nand Parent A took off with kids, threatened Case Aide, and\npotentially had weapons. DHHS Supervisor expressed her serious\nconcern with the decision to allow the visits to occur in Relative\nA’s home due to Parent A and Relative A’s history of violence,\nweapons, and DHHS findings. DHHS Supervisor stated agency\nstaff have not been able to provide rationale as to why they\nbelieve Relative A’s home is a safe place for visits.\n2",
    "DHHS Worker was interviewed via Teams on 4/13/2023. DHHS\nWorker stated that Foster Care Worker was the assigned worker\nduring the 10/30/2022 incident and was well aware of the DHHS\nfindings; however, Relative A continued to attend visits with mom.\nShe reported that on 4/5/2023, during a meeting, Foster Care\nSupervisor and Foster Care Worker were reminded of DHHS\nfindings and pending criminal charges against Relative A following\nthe October 2022 incident. DHHS Worker reported she is involved\nin another incident that occurred in February during which Parent\nB allowed Relative A to pick the youths up from daycare. Relative\nA was supposed to return the youths to Parent B, but she and\nParent A kept the youths overnight.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via Teams on\n4/13/2023. She reported Youth A and Youth B were placed with\ntheir maternal grandmother, Relative A, until the court ordered the\nchildren be returned to their father, Parent B, in October 2022.\nShe stated Youth A & Youth B’s mother, Parent A, now lives with\nRelative A. Foster Care Supervisor stated, after the youths were\nreturned to Parent B, Parent A continued to have supervised\nvisits. These visits were occurring either at Parent A’s great-aunt\nhome, Relative B’s home or at Relative A’s home and were\nsupervised by agency staff. Foster Care Supervisor reported she\nis aware of the DHHS investigation involving Relative A and\nParent A in which it was determined they assaulted Parent B’s\nLTP in front of Parent B’s home on October 30, 2022. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated she was aware Parent A had a knife during the\nincident and Relative A “maybe” had a gun but stated Relative A\nhas a license to carry so she was allowed to have the gun;\nhowever, she stated she did not know how the gun was used\nduring the incident. Foster Care Supervisor stated Youth’s A and\nYouth B were present during the assault; however, she did not\nfeel they were at any risk of harm because they were in the car.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated, despite the DHHS investigation\nresulting in a preponderance of evidence to support findings\nagainst Relative A and Parent A, Foster Care Supervisor\ndetermined Relative A was safe and appropriate and the findings\ndid not have anything to do with neglect or abuse of Youth A &\nYouth B; however, when asked which children were involved in\nthe findings, she stated Youth A & Youth B. She stated the DHHS\ninvestigation was completed after the youths were already placed\nwith Parent B, so there was no need to remove from Relative A.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated that Relative A’s home was “never\nunsafe” and visits in her home were always supervised. She\n3",
    "added there were never any concerns with the children being\nplaced in the home or subsequent visits occurring in the home.\nShe stated a visit took place 4/3/2023 in Relative A’s home during\nwhich the youths disclosed being inappropriately touched. This\ndisclosure was made to Parent A as she was bathing the youths.\nCase Aide, who was supervising the visit, called Program\nManager to inform her of the disclosure and subsequently offered\nto take the youth to the hospital for examination. Foster Care\nSupervisor received a call from Program Manager after which she\ncalled DHHS with the allegation. Foster Care Supervisor stated\nParent A & Relative A took off with the youths in their car and\nbrought them to the hospital. Foster Care Supervisor called the\npolice, who stated they were not going to dispatch anyone if the\nyouths were being brought to the hospital. Foster Care Supervisor\nstated she doesn’t know why, but Case Aide did not follow Parent\nA & Relative A to the hospital; however, Foster Care Worker did\ngo to the hospital where she stayed with the youths.\nFoster Care Supervisor was asked if she was aware Case Aide\nfelt threatened by Parent A and Relative A prior to them leaving\nwith the children. She stated she does not feel that Case Aide was\nthreatened, rather, Parent A and Relative A made Case Aide “feel\nuncomfortable” and “maybe outside of her personal comfort zone.”\nFoster Care Supervisor stated Case Aide was aware of Relative A\n& Parent A’s investigation history and has been supervising their\nvisit for quite a while.\nCase Aide was interviewed by phone on 4/13/2023. She reported\nshe has been supervising Parent A’s visits since June of 2022.\nShe stated Parent A stopped visiting for a while then resumed\nvisitation in October of 2022. Case Aide reported Parent A’s visits\nwere sporadic and initially took place at the agency, then took\nplace at Relative B’s home. Sometime after December, the visits\nstarted occurring in Relative A’s home. Case Aide stated the visits\nwere appropriate and she had never felt unsafe in the home until\nthe 4/3/2023 visit. During the visit, Youth A & Youth B made a\ndisclosure of being inappropriately touched to Parent A who\nstarted crying and became angry and upset. Case Aide assisted\nher in making a call to DHHS, which went fine. When Case Aide\ntold Parent A that Case Aide could drive the youths to the hospital\nfor examination and Parent A could follow her, Parent A became\nangry and told Case Aide she would drive her own children to the\nhospital while Case Aide followed. Parent A told Case Aide to “get\nthe fuck out,” then got into Case Aide’s face, yelling, which Case\nAide found threatening. Case Aide stated that Parent A put her\n4",
    "hand into her own pocket while getting into Case Aide’s face,\nwhich made Case Aide concerned about a potential weapon. She\nstated she is used to Parent A getting loud and yelling, which\nCase Aide doesn’t find threatening, but her gestures and body\nlanguage during this incident were threatening. Case Aide stated\nParent A and Relative A kept going into different rooms of the\nhouse where Case Aide could not see them and would not\nrespond to Case Aide. At one point, Case Aide heard Youth B say\n“I saw your toy gun” to Parent A while they were in another room,\nso she was unsure what Parent A and Relative A were doing.\nParent A and Relative A then left the home with the youths. Case\nAide followed them until they got to the freeway.\nCase Aide stated she had been made aware of the October\nincident and investigation involving Relative A and Parent A. She\nstated that she questioned why the visits would occur in Relative\nA’s home after that incident and was told it was ok since the\naltercation in October happened outside of Parent B’s home. Case\nAide thought this odd since she also picks up and drops off the\nyouths from Parent B’s home, but continued to supervise those\nvisits at Relative A’s home as it was not her decision.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via Teams on 4/19/2023.\nShe reported Youth A & Youth B were placed in Relative A’s\nhome in July of 2020. She stated that the youths were ordered to\nbe returned to Parent B in October of 2022. Foster Care Worker\nwas transitioning the youth to Parent B’s home during which\nParent B continued to have unsupervised weekend visits. Relative\nA would meet Parent B at a local police station for pick-up and\ndrop-off for the visits. Foster Care Worker doesn’t know the\nreason why, but on 10/30/2022, Relative A told Parent B she\nwould pick the youths up from his home. Parent B had previously\ninformed Parent A, Caregiver A, and Foster Care Worker that one\nof the youths had sustained an injury while playing during his\nvisitation. When Relative A arrived at Parent B’s home to pick up\nthe youths, she had Parent A in the car, which was not approved\nby Foster Care Worker. Parent A and Relative A were angry about\nthe injury and, after placing Youth A & Youth B in Relative A’s car,\nstarted an argument then a physical altercation with Parent B’s\ngirlfriend. Parent A and Relative A had two guns, a knife, and\nbrass knuckles with them. Parent B sustained cuts as a result of\nwrestling the knife away from Parent A, which Parent A\nbrandished after failed attempts to disengage the safety from a\ngun she had.\n5",
    "Foster Care Worker reported she already had a TDM Meeting\nscheduled for 2 days after the incident at which time the youths\nwere going to return to Parent B. During that meeting, it was\ndecided the youths would be moved from Relative A to Relative B\nand the return home would be delayed while the incident was\ninvestigated by law enforcement. Foster Care Worker stated she\narranged to have law enforcement present when she removed the\nyouths from Relative A’s home due to Relative A’s history as well\nas Relative A and Parent A’s angry reactions during the TDM.\nFoster Care Worker reported when she arrived to pick the youths\nup from Relative A, no one was home. While in her car, Foster\nCare Worker saw Relative A pull up, look at Foster Care Worker,\nthen drive off down the road. A short time later, Relative A\nreturned, but again tried to leave at which time law enforcement\nand a DHHS Worker that had since arrived, used their cars to\nblock Relative A from leaving again. Foster Care Worker stated\nRelative A did not have the youths in her car, rather, they were in\nher home alone with Parent A, which is not allowed per court\norder. Foster Care Worker was then able to transport the youths\nto Relative B’s home. Approximately one week later, law\nenforcement cleared Parent B of any charges, so it was\ndetermined Youth A & Youth B would be returned to his home. On\nthe date and time Foster Care Worker had arranged to pick the\nyouth’s up from Relative B, neither Relative B nor the youths were\nat Relative B’s home. Foster Care Worker called her Program\nManager to let her know. Either Program Manager or Director\nspoke to Relative B after which Foster Care Worker was told by\nProgram Manager to leave and plan on picking the youths up the\nfollowing day.\nOn 2/15/2023, Parent B, who had used Relative A as a support,\nasked Relative A to pick the youths up from daycare for him.\nRelative A asked Parent B if she could keep the children for a little\nwhile for a celebration after which Parent A texted Parent B and\ntold him they were not bringing the youths back to him and\nblocked his number so he could not text or call back. Parent B\ntexted and called Foster Care Worker directly, rather than calling\nthe on-call number, so Foster Care Worker did not know about\nthis until the following day. Parent B had also called law\nenforcement. Relative A and Parent A returned the youths to\nParent B on 2/16/2023.\nRegarding visits, Foster Care Worker reported that Parent A’s\nvisits began occurring over Zoom due to the safety concerns\npresented by the 10/30/2023 incident. In December of 2022,\nParent A’s visits moved to being in-person at Relative B’s home\n6",
    "and were supervised by agency staff. After two visits at Relative\nB’s home, Parent A called Foster Care Worker on the day of her\nscheduled visit and stated that Relative B was sick, so she wanted\nto do the visit at Relative A’s home. Foster Care Worker stated\nthat there was not enough notice, so the visit was cancelled. The\nnext week, Parent A again called on the day of her scheduled visit\nto say Relative B was sick and visits couldn’t be at her home\nanymore then requested the visit take place at Relative A’s home.\nDespite Foster Care Worker telling Parent A that the visit location\nwould not be changed at such short notice, Parent A then called\nCase Aide and told her Foster Care Worker approved the location\nchange. Foster Care Worker cancelled the visit due to the\nmanipulation. Foster Care Worker stated Parent A refused to do\nher visits at the agency and did not want either Foster Care\nWorker or Case Aide at the visits. The court ordered supervised\nvisits, so Foster Care Worker had a discussion with Case Aide\nabout moving the visits to Relative A’s home. Foster Care Worker\nstated that Case Aide was comfortable with supervising visits at\nRelative A’s home. Foster Care Worker stated that the decision to\nmove the visits to Relative A’s home happened quickly. She\nstated that she had been burned out from this case since\nDecember of 2022 and Parent A was screaming and yelling at her\nabout the location. Foster Care Worker mistakenly thought she\nhad a conversation with her supervisor in which it was agreed to\nmove the visits to Relative A’s home. Visits took place in Relative\nA’s home two or three times, without incident, until the 4/3/2023\nvisit.\nFoster Care Worker stated that Parent A has “always been the red\nflag” and that Relative A was always appropriate and has never\ngiven the agency staff reason to make them feel unsafe. Foster\nCare Worker stated this case was reassigned from her to Foster\nCare Supervisor as of 4/6/2023. Foster Care Worker stated that\nshe requested the case be transferred to a different worker at\nleast 5 times prior to the transfer.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via Teams on 4/26/2023. She\nreported she was aware of the incident that occurred on\n10/30/2022; however, she was not aware that DHHS had made\nfindings. She stated the youths remained with Relative A until they\nwere returned to Parent B and were never removed from Relative\nA. When I informed Program Manager during her interview the\nyouths had been removed per the worker’s interview as well as\nMiSACWIS placement documentation, Program Manager replied\nshe did not know that had occurred. She reported she did not\nknow about Relative A leaving the youths alone with Parent A at\n7",
    "the time Foster Care Worker went to Relative A’s home to remove\nthe children or that Relative A had attempted to leave. Program\nManager stated she was not aware that an attempt was made to\npick up the youths from Relative B’s home, but they were not\npresent. She stated she would have been on leave on that date,\nso Foster Care Worker’s statement that Program Manager told her\nshe could leave the youths wherever they were and try again the\nfollowing day was inaccurate. Program Manager wasn’t made\naware of the incident during which Relative B picked the youths up\nfrom daycare and kept them overnight without permission until\nafter the 4/3/2023 incident.\nProgram Manager reported not knowing the decision was made to\nbegin having visits at Relative A’s house. She stated Relative A\nshould not have been present at visits following the 10/30/2023\nincident and visits never should have occurred in her home due to\nthe volatility of the environment. Program Manger reported when\nshe found out that visits had been taking place in Relative A’s\nhome, Foster Care Worker and Case Aide told her that Parent A\ndid not want her visits at the office, so made the decision to\nchange the visit location to Relative A’s home. Program Manager\nstated it’s problematic she is unaware of so many details of this\ncase and that the staff allowed Relative A to dictate the visits.\nProgram Manager reported these concerns are being addressed\nthrough Human Resources and Parent A's visits are now\noccurring at the agency office without Relative A present.\nDirector/Chief Administrator was interviewed via Teams on\n4/27/2023. She reported she didn’t know that Parent A’s visits\nwere occurring at Relative A’s home until after the 4/3/2023 visit.\nShe stated there should have been a meeting with Foster Care\nWorker and management before a decision was made regarding\nallowing visits at Relative A’s home. She reported she recalled\ntalking to Relative B about the youths moving from her home to\nParent B due to Relative B not understanding that the youths were\ncourt ordered to be returned to him and that they weren’t being\nremoved from her for any other reason. Director does not recall if\nthere was an issue with the youth’s not being at Relative B’s when\nFoster Care Worker arrived to pick them up. She reported she\ndidn’t know about Relative A having picked up the youths from\ndaycare and keeping them overnight until after the 4/3/2023\nincident. She stated the lack of communication in this case is\nconcerning and is being addressed.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\n• Placement History\n8",
