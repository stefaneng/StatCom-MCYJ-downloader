    "ALLEGATION:\nThere has been a lack of responsiveness from the agency during emergencies.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 11/18/2021 I received a copy a complaint submitted through the DCWL on-line\nreporting system by a foster parent alleging that the agency has not been responsive\nto calls made to the on-call worker outside of traditional work hours.\nInterviews\nOn 11/24/2021 I interviewed Foster Parent (FP) by phone. She reported Youth A\nwas placed in her home on 10/12/2021 and was removed on 11/23/2021 at her\nrequest. During the time Youth A was in her home, she made 3 calls to the agency’s\non-call worker that were not answered. She stated that on a 4th occasion, she called\nthe on-call worker, which was not answered, but called back within the hour. She\nindicated all of the calls were related to crisis occurring in the home due to Youth A’s\nbehavior.\nOn 12/2/2021 I interviewed the agency Program Manager (PM) and the Director\nresponsible for supervising the case via video conferencing. PM & Director reported\nthey were aware FP had called the on-call phone sometime in mid to late October\nand did not receive a response. PM & Director stated the worker who had the phone\nat the time slept through that phone call. They stated that they were not aware of\nany other calls made by FP that were not answered, but they would look through the\non-call phone history.\nOn 12/7/2021 I received an email from PM identifying the worker (FCW1) who was\nresponsible for sleeping through the call made to the on-call phone by FP. PM\nreported that FCW1’s supervisor has met with her to address this concern. PM\nstated that she looked through the on-call phone’s call log to determine if any other\ncalls from FP were missed or not returned timely but did not locate any.\nDocument Review\nOn 12/6/2021 I reviewed a copy of the agency’s on-call procedure provided by\nDirector. The procedure states that the on-call worker must return all missed calls as\nsoon as possible, but not more than 30 minutes after the missed call.\nOn 12/6/2021 I reviewed a copy of the agency’s Placement Agreement Between\nFoster Parents and Wellspring Lutheran Services which was signed by an agency\nworker and FP on 1/21/2021 which states that the agency will provide FP with an\nafterhours on-call telephone number for emergency calls. The document states that\nthe on-call worker will do their best to return calls within 30 minutes.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12202 Policy and procedures.\n(1) An agency shall have and follow written policies and\nprocedures for all of the following:\n3",
    "(e) Staff responsibilities.\nANALYSIS: Foster Care Worker 1 slept through an after-hours crisis phone\ncall made by Foster Parent and did not return the call within the\nrequired 30 minutes as dictated by agency policy.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThere has also been a lack of needed support services referred.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 11/18/2021 I received a copy a complaint submitted through the DCWL on-line\nreporting system by a foster parent alleging that the agency did not refer the youth to\nneeded services in a timely manner.\nInterviews\nOn 11/24/2021 I interviewed FP by phone. She reported when Youth A was placed\nin her home on 10/12/2021 she was informed by agency staff Youth A was receiving\nWraparound services and counseling in another county prior to being placed with\nFP. She stated that she did receive Serious Emotional Disturbance Waiver (SEDW)\npaperwork needed to receive Wraparound services, but those services had not\nstarted at the time the complaint allegation was submitted and the assigned foster\ncare worker (FCW2) told FP on three different occasions that she had “just”\nsubmitted the referral, causing FP to doubt if or when the paperwork had been\nsubmitted. FP reported that she was also told Youth A qualified for Enhanced Foster\nCare (EFC) services, which also had not been started at the time the complaint\nallegation was submitted.\nOn 12/2/2021 I interviewed the agency Program Manager (PM) and the Director\nresponsible for supervising the case via video conferencing. PM reported Youth A\nwas receiving Wraparound services prior to placement with FP, but when the youth\nwas moved to FP’s home, which was in a different county than the previous\nplacement, the service had to be stopped in the previous county then re-started in\nFP’s county. As far as the EFC services, PM stated that it did take some time to get\nstarted as the agency was initially trying to shuffle caseloads amongst workers in\norder for an internal worker to provide the services, but they were unable to make\nthat work so they had to contract out to another agency to provide the service, which\nstarted on 11/22/2021, just prior to Youth A leaving FP’s home.\nDocument Review\nOn 12/7/2021 I received and reviewed an email from PM stating:\n On 10/20/2021 FCW2 completed a referral for EFC services.\n Agency staff attempted to adjust caseloads in order to allow room on an agency\ncaseworker’s caseload to provide EFC services internally, but due to staffing\nissues, they were not able to do so.\n4",
    " Additional paperwork and information gathering was completed by Director, PM,\nand FCW2\n On 11/15/2021 the agency submitted a request to the West Michigan\nPartnership for Children (WMPC) as required in order to request permission to\npartner with another agency to provide EFC services.\n On 11/17/2021 WMPC approved the request.\n On 11/18/2021 another agency agreed to accept the EFC case of Youth A.\n On 11/19/2021 the EFC referral was completed and submitted.\n EFC services started on 11/22/2021.\nOn 12/16/2021 I received and reviewed an email from PM stating:\n Wraparound services for Youth A started 6/9/2021 in his placement county.\n Wraparound services ended in the county in which Youth A was placed when he\nmoved to a different county on 10/12/21 and was placed in FP’s home.\n The required paperwork an approval process for transferring Wraparound\nservices from one county to another took approximately 4 weeks.\n Wraparound services began in FP’s home on 11/9/2021.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nMISEP 6.20 Provision of services\nDHHS shall ensure that the services identified in the service\nplan are made available in a timely and appropriate manner\nto the child and family and shall monitor the provision of\nservices to determine whether they are of appropriate\nquality and are having the intended effect.\nANALYSIS: The services for which Youth A was assessed and approved to\nreceive are being provided.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nFoster parents are not being paid the correct DOC.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 11/18/2021 I received a copy a complaint submitted through the DCWL on-line\nreporting system by a foster parent alleging that the agency did not secure an\nappropriate Determination of Care rate based on the youth’s needs.\nInterviews\nOn 11/24/2021 I interviewed FP by phone. She reported when Youth A was placed\nin her home on 10/12/2021 she was informed by agency staff that Youth A was\nreceiving Wraparound services and counseling in another county prior to being\n5",
    "placed with FP and also qualified for Enhanced Foster Care (EFC) services;\nhowever, she did not receive any Determination of Care payments and only received\nthe daily foster care rate payment.\nOn 12/2/2021 I interviewed the agency Program Manager (PM) and the Director\nresponsible for supervising the case via video conferencing. PM reported the most\nrecent worker has completed current DOC paperwork. PM reported she doesn’t\nknow why FP wouldn’t receive DOC payments since Youth A qualified for and was\nreceiving a DOC 3 rate in his previous placement.\nDocument Review\nOn 12/2/2021 I reviewed Youth A and FP’s case files in MiSACWIS. I located the\nSED Waiver Payment Request and Approval (DHS-1254) form. This document was\nsigned by FP on 10/27/2021 and approved on 11/1/2021. This form documented that\na SEDW DOC rate was approved on 11/1/2021. FP’s provider record documented\nthose payments were made to FP at the approved SEDW DOC rate for each day\nYouth A was placed in her home.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 903-3 WAIVER FOR CHILDREN WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL\nDISTURBANCE (SED WAIVER)\nCommunity Mental Health and MDHHS determines eligibility\nand approval for the SED Waiver. A foster parent or a relative\nwho is receiving foster care payments for a child enrolled in\nthe SED Waiver Project is eligible for the $50 per diem. The\nSED Waiver approved rate is only applicable to foster care\npayments.\nOnce the local MDHHS office receives notification from the\nWaiver Support Application (WSA) of the child’s eligibility for\nthe SED Waiver the worker must route the DHS-1254, SED\nWaiver Payment Request and Approval, to the behavioral\nhealth analyst in the Child Welfare Medical Unit for approval\nand signature. The behavioral health analyst will approve and\nroute the service authorization to FCD for final approval.\nNote: Children receiving the additional rate for the SED Waiver\nare not also eligible for a DOC or a treatment foster care rate.\nANALYSIS: The foster parent’s case record documents that she was paid\nthe appropriate and approved rate.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\n6",
