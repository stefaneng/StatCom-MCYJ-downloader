Compliance\n12/01/2020 Contact – Telephone call made\nVirtual interview with Adoption Worker\n12/07/2020 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION:\nAgency failed to re-apply for adoption assistance for a family prior to adoption\nfinalization.\nINVESTIGATION:\nA complaint was received on 10/5/2020 which stated that the adoption agency failed\nto re-apply for adoption assistance for a family prior to finalization of the adoption.\nThe complaint stated that the original denial of subsidy occurred on 5/23/17, Order\nPlacing Child After Consent (OPC) occurred on 9/13/17, and Order of Adoption was\nsigned on 11/1/17. The child turned 3 in early October 2017, which would have\nmade the family eligible for adoption assistance if the worker had reapplied.\nThe Adoption and Guardianship Assistance Office (AGAO) was contacted on\n10/5/20 to confirm the information in the complaint and to obtain case information.\nA review of the case file indicated the dates in the complaint were correct.\nAdditionally, consent was granted on 8/24/17, the Petition to Adopt was filed on\n9/13/17 and The Order Terminating Rights after Release of Consent (OTR) was\nsigned on 9/13/17.\nAn e-mail was received from the Chief Administrator providing the contact\ninformation for the staff on this case. The supervisor at the time of the adoption is no\nlonger with the agency and contact information for her could not be obtained.\nInterview with Manager: A video call was completed with the Program Manager on\n11/23/20. Also on the call was the Chief Administrator. The Manager stated that the\nadoption worker had applied for adoption subsidy which was denied because the\nyouth was two years old and not eligible for subsidy. By the time the adoption was\nfinalized the child had turned three, making him eligible for subsidy. She stated the\nadoption worker did not re-apply for subsidy.\n3",
    "The Manager stated she talked to Worker 1 about the allegations and Worker 1 told\nher she had talked to the family about the eligibility criteria for adoption subsidy.\nWorker 1 anticipated that the case would be finalized before Youth A turned three.\nShe thought the case would have been finalized in two to three weeks from OTR.\nThe Manager stated that policy is to push for adoption without subsidy. She said it is\nthe agency's practice to let the family know the criteria and if they want to delay\nfinalization it is up to them. She stated the agency does not want to be the reason\nthat finalization is delayed.\nShe stated that policy does not say subsidy can be re-applied for when there is a\nchange in eligibility. Policy says it must be re-applied for if there is a change in\ncircumstance or the youth's plan. She stated they were within policy requirements\nbut that is not how the agency typically operates.\nAdoption Worker Interview: The adoption worker was interviewed via video\nconferencing on 12/01/20. Supervisor 1 was also present. She stated that she did\nnot have the date that she applied for subsidy. She said subsidy was denied and she\nhad a discussion with the family about this. She stated there was a delay in\ncompleting the Adoption Home Evaluation (612) and consent because they were\nwaiting on a Special Evaluation (SE) being done on the home. She sated once the\nSE was completed the 612 was then completed on 8/8/17. She then received\nconsent for adoption on 8/10/17. She had everything ready to be filed and she filed\nthe adoption paperwork with the court on 9/1/20. Leading up to the adoption\npaperwork being filed the Adoption Worker had a discussion with the family and her\nsupervisor about not being able to wait until Youth A turned 3 because all the\npaperwork was in and complete. She stated the family did not push the issue.\nThe adoption worker stated the family lived in Kalamazoo County so they decided to\nfile there because it was taking Kalamazoo two to three weeks to finalize adoptions.\nThe adoption worker stated that the court contacted her and said that with Adoption\nDay coming up they were pushing all finalizations to 11/1/17, which was adoption\nday. She was informed of this on 9/13/17. The family decided they would do the\nfinalization on adoption day. The adoption worker stated that on 9/13/17 the OTR\nand OPC were signed. She stated she could no longer apply for adoption subsidy\nafter those orders were signed. The Supervisor was asked to clarify if that was\ncorrect and the supervisor stated that was incorrect. Adoption subsidy can be\napplied for after OTR and OPC are signed. The Adoption worker stated that at the\ntime of the case it was her understanding that she could no longer apply.\nAdoption Worker’s employee file indicated she was hired on 3/14/14. She received\nher initial adoption training in 2014 but received a training on Adoption Subsidy on\n11/30/20 after this issue was discovered. The Adoption Worker received one\ndiscipline for on 10/28/20 for late reports.\n4",
    "The MDHHS Adoption Contract held by the agency states the following:\nThe Contractor shall be responsible for providing information to\nthe prospective adoptive family parent(s) regarding the adoption\nassistance programs on behalf of all children available for adoption. If\nthe Contractor fails to provide information, fails to apply for adoption\nassistance or finalizes an adoption prior to the execution of an\nadoption assistance contract, and it is later determined that the child\nwas eligible for adoption assistance, the Contractor shall be\nresponsible for providing financial support to the adoptive family\nequal to the adoption assistance amount and eligible Medicaid\ncoverage, from the time the adoptive family makes the request for\nthe re-determination of eligibility and the date MDHHS determines\nthat an error occurred based on the Contractor’s failure to inform or\napply for adoption assistance.\nFurther clarification was sought from the MDHHS Policy Office and it was reported\nthat a child’s change in age is a change in circumstance.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nAAM 200 CHANGES IN FAMILY OR CHILD’S CIRCUMSTANCES\nAfter an adoption assistance application has been\nsubmitted and/or approved or denied, the adoption\ncaseworker must submit a new DHS 1341, Adoption\nAssistance and Medical Subsidy Application, if there is a\nchange in the child’s adoption plan or circumstances\nbefore adoption finalization. The child’s eligibility for\nadoption assistance and nonrecurring adoption expenses\nprograms must be redetermined.\nANALYSIS: The Adoption Worker, AGAO, Supervisor 1, and the program\nmanager all confirmed that the Adoption worker did not re-apply\nfor adoption assistance once Youth A turned three years old and\nprior to the finalization of the adoption.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan it is recommended that this\ninvestigation be closed with no further licensing action.\n5",
