    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription\n(4) Only the least restrictive intervention necessary to prevent\nimmediate harm to the youth or others may be used and must\nfollow an individualized set of graduated interventions that avoid\nthe use of restraints.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 7/25/23, staff performed an unwarranted restraint.\nInvestigation On 8/2/23, I interviewed Complainant, also DCWL Area Manager,\nvia phone regarding the allegation. She said a review of\nMISACWIS incident report #159460207 dated 7/25/23 indicated\nstaff at the facility physically restrained Youth T for taking off her\nshirt and pulling a fire alarm, and these reasons for physical\nrestraint were unjustified.\nI notified Youth T’s Juvenile Justice Worker of the investigation\nassignment.\nI contacted Chief Administrator via phone requesting staff\nschedules to arrange interviews.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing rule violations.\nI arrived unannounced at the facility on 8/3/23 and reviewed video\nof the incident with assistance from Chief Administrator and\nOperations Manager.\nVIDEO of Pod 3 on 7/25/23 (no audio)\n3:02 – Youth T is sitting on a chair in the corner of the pod\nrefusing to comply with staff directives. Supervisor, Staff 1, 2, 3\nand 4 are standing talking with her. The other youths are inside of\ntheir rooms.\n3:02 – 3:09:46 – Staff 2, 3 and 4 continue talking with Youth T\nwhile Supervisor and Staff 1 search her room and remove trash.\nSupervisor and Staff 1 return to verbally intervene.\n3:09:47 – Youth T takes both arms out of her shirt leaving it\nhanging on her neck.\n3:11:12 – Youth T takes the shirt off her neck, and it drops to the\nfloor. She is left wearing a sports bra and pants. Staff continue\ntalking with her.\n2",
    "3:11:53 – Youth T pulls a fire alarm nearby. *Note: When the fire\nalarm goes off, all staff and youth in the building hear the alarm\nand staff begin gathering youths to safety until Staff 1 radioed that\nit was a false alarm.\n3:12 – Supervisor initiates a standing Primary Restraint Technique\n(PRT) single person escort method. Youth T drops to her knees.\n3:12 – 3:17:49 - Supervisor pulls Youth T up to the wall and\ninitiates a PRT Standing Wall restraint. Supervisor maintains the\nsingle person restraint.\n3:17:50 - Youth T walks to her room escorted by Supervisor.\nBay Pines Center utilizes the Handle with Care physical\nmanagement training model. Supervisor is a Handle with Care\ntrainer. There are no disciplinary write-ups in Supervisor’s\nemployee file.\nI reviewed the Handle with Care restraint techniques training\nmanual. PRT as a Standing Wall restraint is an approved\ntechnique that instructs staff “For an in-facing wall restraint,\nalways back yourself to the wall and turn the client to face the wall\non the tightest possible axis to avoid impact.”\nI interviewed Youth T, age 18. MISACWIS indicates she is a\ndelinquent state ward who was in the Macomb County Detention\nCenter from 7/26/21 – 4/11/23 and transferred to Bay Pines for\nresidential sex offender and victimization treatment on 4/11/23.\nOn the date of the incident Youth T said Staff 1 asked her to go to\nher room and she refused. “I don’t know why I pulled the fire\nalarm. Supervisor restrained me with my arms back and up\nagainst the wall. He didn’t hurt me. He was trying to help.” I\nasked Youth T about the other staff. She offered “Staff 1 is a\ngood staff. She didn’t do nothing wrong. She just gets\ndisappointed when she knows we can do better.” I asked Youth T\nwhy she takes off her clothes. She answered, “It’s related to my\ntrauma.”\nI interviewed Supervisor. He is a Handle with Care trainer, has\nworked at the facility for 13 years and been a supervisor for the\nlast five. On 7/25/23 Supervisor said Youth T was refusing to\nfollow staff directions and took off her shift. “I told her I’d have to\nescort her to her room for the safety of her peers. She pulled the\nfire alarm and I put her in a one-man PRT to escort to her room.\nShe resisted and dropped to the floor. She ended up in a\nstanding PRT wall restraint. She deescalated and allowed me to\nescort her to her room.”\n3",
    "I asked Supervisor why he initiated a one-man PRT escort on\nYouth T for pulling a fire alarm. He responded, “I didn’t start the\nescort because she pulled the fire alarm. I started it because she\ntook her shirt off.” I asked Supervisor why Youth T taking her shirt\noff is a safety issue. He stated “Youths can see out of their\nwindows. If a youth is exposing herself on the pod, they would be\nvictimized by what they’d see. Some are already victims of sex\nabuse. Age also makes a difference here. Others on the pod are\nunder 18,” he explained. “It is a sex offense for her to expose\nherself to youth. It’s reoffending. If we allowed her to victimize\nother youth, we’d be negligent of the other youth,” he reasoned.\nI interviewed Staff 1 who has worked at the facility as a youth\nspecialist for over two years. I reminded her of the incident on\n7/25/23 and asked if the escort that developed into a physical\nrestraint of Youth T was justified. Staff 1 responded emphatically,\n“Absolutely! It was justified because just a few weeks ago, she\ntook her clothes off and smeared menstrual blood on me. She is\na grown woman and was threatening to kick my ass. She told me\n‘You thought I was bad last time...’ I called Supervisor.”\nI asked more about Youth T removing her clothes. Staff 1\nexplained “We can’t have her exposing herself to kids. She’s 18.\nWe have six other youths under 17 on the pod. We need to\nprotect the other youths from that.” I reminded her that the other\nyouths were in their rooms when this happened. She said from\ntheir rooms, they can still see out of their windows. Staff 1\nsummarized some of the challenges of mixing adult sex offenders\nwith younger traumatized youth. “We have high boundaries here\n(related to dressing modesty) because of their (youths) traumas.\nYouth T is in sex offender treatment and has grooming tendencies\nsuch as giving away snacks to (younger) youths.”\nI interviewed Therapist who has been a group leader at the facility\nfor five years. She said she has a master’s degree in Trauma\nCounseling and is a certified Crisis Prevention trainer.\nTherapist explained Youth T’s records from Macomb County\nDetention Center show she has a history of exposing herself and\nattacking staff. Since June 2023, Youth T has exposed herself\ntwice on the pod at Bay Pines. Therapist explained why disrobing\nis a safety issue. “Taking off clothes is triggering and traumatizes\nother youth. It’s a pattern where Youth T escalates into physical\naggression from there. In certain instances, I feel this (behavior)\ncan warrant physical restraint. I say that because it’s done to\n4",
    "minimize harm to others and preserve the youth’s own dignity.”\nTherapist also mentioned the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA)\nas a law requiring staff to protect youth in institutions from sexual\nvictimization. Additionally, she explained that the loud noises and\nflashing lights from a pulled fire alarm are re-traumatizing to the\nother youths and sends them into flashbacks.\nChild Caring Institution Licensing Rule 400.4160 Emergency\nrestraint identifies restraint as a “lifesaving response…to protect\nthe youth or others from an unanticipated or severely aggressive\nbehavior that places the youth or others at serious threat of\nviolence or injury if no immediate intervention occurs.” Using\nrestraint pre-emptively to protect others from being emotionally\ntriggered or retraumatized are not included as justification.\nAnalysis Although Supervisor, who is a Handle with Care trainer, utilized\napproved physical management techniques, in this case,\nrestraining Youth T for removing her shirt or pulling the fire alarm\nwas not justified. Less restrictive interventions to de-escalate her\nshould have been continued.\nCONSULTATION\nAll of the staff interviewed were extremely knowledgeable of the\ntreatment strategies and interventions for both victims and\noffenders of sexual abuse. While often offenders were once\nvictims, it is challenging to treat victims and offenders on the same\npod and ideally, they should be separated. In residential\ntreatment, it is also best practice to separate minors from adults,\nbut the facility has neither the space nor the resources to do so.\nGiven the circumstances, the staff must find new ways to protect\nyouths from other youths while still adhering to the current\nlicensing rules regarding seclusion and restraint.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established for Rule 400.4159 (2)\nSIR 2022C0116020, intake 1/27/22; CAP approved 3/17/22\nSIR 2022C0128017, intake 12/21/21; CAP approved 2/7/22\nSIR 2023C0000517, intake 6/5/23; CAP approved 7/28/23\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nAugust 9, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 9, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
