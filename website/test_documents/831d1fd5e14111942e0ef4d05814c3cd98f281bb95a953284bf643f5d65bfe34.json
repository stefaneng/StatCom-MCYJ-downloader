    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nMDHHS Western Wayne Office relocation.\nIII. Methodology\nThis consultant toured the building at the new location on 3/30/2016.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe new MDHHS office is located on the north side of Michigan Avenue just west of\nInkster road. There is ample and separate parking for both employees and\nrecipients of services. The employee lot is gated and provides a separate employee\nentrance.\nThe building and grounds are new. Upon entry, there is a large open lobby with a\npodium for security personnel and a sign-in sheet, and support staff sitting further\nback behind Plexiglas. Past the lobby behind a secured door are four small\nconference rooms designated for family team meetings, four private visiting rooms\nwith coinciding observation rooms separated by one-way mirrors, and one large\nplayroom/multiple family visiting room.\nBeyond the public area and behind another secured door is the employee work area.\nThe office has new carpeting and the walls are covered with color-coordinated fresh\npaint. Along the perimeter of the space, there are a few private offices, several\nsmall private meeting rooms, a large employee lunch room, restrooms, and a large\nmeeting/conference room.\nIn the center of the space are cubicles for office staff and docking stations for\nmobile/field staff. Supervisors are located together in cubicles. File cabinets and\ncopy machines are located throughout the space.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend this facility continue their current licensing status.\nApril 4, 2016\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n2"
