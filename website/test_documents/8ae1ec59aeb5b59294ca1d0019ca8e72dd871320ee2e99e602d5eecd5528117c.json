    "Allegation Staff sexually assaulted youth during a zoom hearing in the zoom\nroom. Staff alleged to bring knife into facility and threaten youth.\nInvestigation Allegation #1:\nOn 1/11/23, I spoke to Administrator 1 via telephone.\nAdministrator 1 reported that Staff 1 has worked for the facility for\n17 years and has not had issues in the past. Administrator 1\nreported he removed Staff 1 from the current unit and placed him\non custodial duty as of right now. Administrator 1 reported this is\nnot the first time that Youth A has made these allegations towards\nadults. Administrator 1 reported she had made familiar allegations\ntowards her attorney and made false police reports. Administrator\n1 reported that on 1/10/23, Youth A had pulled a staff aside stating\nshe no longer wanted to go through with the allegations and\nstated it was false, other than Staff 1 attempted to kiss her.\nAdministrator 1 reported there has not been a grievance filed by\nany youth pertaining to these allegations.\nAll interviews were conducted with DHHS Worker 1 unless\notherwise noted.\nOn 1/12/23, I interviewed Youth A face to face at the facility. Youth\nA reported that she made up all of the allegations. Youth A\nreported that Staff 1 did not attempt to kiss her or touch her leg.\nYouth A reported that Staff 1 has not expressed any affectionate\nemotions towards her.\nI interviewed Staff 1. Staff 1 reported he has not stated anything\ninappropriate to Youth A or made any type of sexual advances\ntowards Youth A. Staff 1 reported he never talked to Youth A\nabout having a relationship with her.\nI reviewed the video for 1/9/23, date of Youth A’s zoom court\nhearing. Youth A does enter the room for her court hearing and is\nwalked to the room by Staff 1. Staff 1 never enters the room and\nsits across the hallway until Youth A exits.\nI reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. All training and clearances are\nup to date. Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary in his file. I\nreviewed Staff 1’s performance evaluations and there were no\nissues noted.\nI reviewed the Incident Report dated 1/10/23. It noted that Youth A\nreported Staff 1 made sexual advancements towards here at her\nzoom meeting on 1/9/23 at 11:00am. Youth A also noted that Staff\n1 made sexual advances towards Youth C and Youth D.\n2",
    "Due to these allegations, interviews were completed with Youth C\nand Youth D by courtesy DHHS Workers. Both Youth C and Youth\nD were discharged from placement.\nYouth C was interviewed by a courtesy DHHS Worker on 2/2/23.\nYouth C reported she was touched by Staff 1 in her inner thigh\nwhen she had a zoom court hearing. Youth C reported that Youth\nD and Staff 1 were “sleeping together”, but Staff 1 and herself\nwere more of a “serious couple” than they (Staff 1 and Youth D)\nwere.\nAfter interviews the police department became involved and\ninvestigation was halted. On 3/13/23, police decided there were\nno charges and gave permission to continue with the licensing\ninvestigation.\nYouth D reported that Staff 1 was never physically inappropriate\nwith her. Youth D reported she had never seen anything between\nStaff 1 and Youth A or Youth C.\nAccording to agency staff schedule and intake documents\nobtained 3/7/23:\nYouth C was admitted on 11/29/22 and placed on the quarantine\nunit until 12/6/22. Staff 1 never worked on the quarantine unit.\nYouth C’s court hearing was on 11/30/23. Staff 1 was not working\nthat day. The second court hearing was on 12/12/22 and a female\nstaff oversaw the zoom meeting that day.\nAllegation #2:\nOn 1/12/23, I interviewed Youth A. Youth A reported that Staff 2\nstated to her after she was restrained (unknown date or time),\n“You are lucky you are not my daughter, or I would cut you up.”\nYouth A reported she never saw Staff 2 with a knife only heard\nfrom another youth that Staff 2 had a knife.\nI interviewed Staff 2. Staff 2 reported he does not have a knife, nor\nhas he brought one into the facility. Staff 2 reported he did make a\nstatement to a youth stating, “I will fucking cut you.” Staff 2\nreported he stated to the youth that he jumped up like he had a\n“knife in his pocket”. Staff 2 reported the youth was playing cards\nand was quite animated and jumped up quick.\n3",
    "Staff 2 reported that Youth A does make up allegations when she\nis upset or doesn’t get her way. Staff 2 reported that this is why\nstaff, in general, are very cautious around her.\nI interviewed Youth B. Youth B reported he has never seen Staff 2\nwith a knife and has never heard Staff 2 threaten anyone with a\nknife.\nOn 2/2/23 in a CAC interview present by on call worker for\nMaltreatment in Care Unit, Youth D reported she had never seen\nStaff 2 with a knife or threaten anyone with a knife.\nStaff 2’s performance evaluation did note that Staff 2 does “joke”\nwith the youth at times and that he needs to be more professional\nin his interactions. Discipline was not done.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to validate that Staff 1 sexually assaulted\nYouth A or Youth C. The video shows that Staff 1 never entered\nthe room with Youth A and Youth A reported she falsely made\nallegations. Youth C reported Staff 1 touched her but there was no\nevidence to validate this. The dates and times introduced by\nYouth C did not line up with Staff 1’s attendance at work or times\nthat Youth C could have interacted with Staff 1. Staff 1 never\ncompleted her zoom hearing and Staff 1 did not staff her in the\nquarantine room.\nThere is no evidence to validate that Staff 2 brought a knife into\nthe facility or threatened youth with a knife. Youth A reported that\nshe made up the allegations and accused staff falsely.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n4/10/23\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
