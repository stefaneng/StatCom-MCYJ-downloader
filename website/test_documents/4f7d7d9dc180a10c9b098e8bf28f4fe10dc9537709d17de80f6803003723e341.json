TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Timely uploading is crucial to maintaining a complete and accurate record\neliminating the need to track down documents for the inspection.",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Borrowed Bed rule requires that everything must be documented and in the\nrecord prior to the placement (unless the placement is after hours in which case\neverything can be obtained/documented within 3 days) subsections (a) through\n(f) must all be documented within the case record either in social work contacts\nor through document uploads prior to placement. The foster parent agency\nagreement must be signed and uploaded prior to placement, unless subsection\n(2) applies.\n• One file reviewed of a case open for nearly one month had minimal case\ncontacts and documents entered. This case should be reviewed by supervision\nto ensure adequate engagement efforts are being made.\n• When a worker transports youth to a medical or dental appointment, they should\nbring the required forms for completion to upload after the appointment.\n• Only the person who wrote/reviewed a service plan and/or PATP should be\nsigning the document as the signature serves as documentation they\nwrote/approved the content. If someone involved in writing or reviewing the\nreport must sign the date after the fact (i.e. forgot to do it at the time of approval)\nthey must date it the actual date they signed it, not backdate to the date they\nshould have signed it. No one should sign/enter anyone else’s name. Signing\nsomeone else’s name and/or backdating anything would be considered\nfalsification. The only circumstance someone would type in someone else’s\nname and initial it, would be if that person gave them permission to do so\nbecause they couldn’t, for some reason. In that case, you would want to\ndocument why that was done and how/when permission was granted. This is\nwhy it is important to obtain signatures and be sure they are entered into the\nrecord timely.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP submitted by the agency was in response to the interim licensing insepction\nreport dated 9/13/2023 and was approved on 9/27/2023. That CAP addressed 12\nviolations (7 licensing and 5 contract/policy.) Six of those violations were rectified\n(performance evals, replacement notifications, periodic dental, notification of\nrights, monthly visits with youth, and child adoption assessment visits) as\nevidenced by there being no repeat citations in those areas and six of the\nviolations (service plan signatures, adoptive family assessment timeframes, FTMs,\ncase contacts, PATP signatures, and medical passport updates) were not rectified\nas evidences by those areas remaining in violation during this year's review. Of\nthose 6 repeated violations, 3 (adoptive family assessment timeframes, FTMs, and\nPATP signatures) have been repeated violations over the past 3 years and will\nrequire asssessment of why previous CAPs were unsuccessful.\nThere has been an increase in number of citations from 11 in 2022 (6 rule & 5\npolicy,) 12 in 2023 (7 rule, 5 policy), to 22 (17 rule, 4 policy, & 1 PA 116 ) in 2024.\nThe increase can partially be attributed to an increase in number of cases being\nmanaged by the agency, a significant number of new staff, and the additional of IL\ncases which have not previously been reviewed at the agency. Additionally, the\nmajority of cases being managed by the agency were recently transferred from\nother agencies. The most concerning citation is the PA 116 citation related to\nproviding accurate and truthful information during inspection. This citation was\nexclusive to service plan signatures in 3 files reviewed and was performed by staff\nwho recently came to the agency. This was immediately addressed by agency\nleadership with those staff to ensure they understand the agency expectations.\nThe increase in citations, the number of repeat citations, as well as the severity of\nthe violations need to be assessed by agency leadership to develop an\nappropriate and effective corrective action plan.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator Assessment was received and reviewed. The chief\nadministrator identified several areas of the previously submitted CAP that were\nimplemented and successful; however, a complete staff turnover, including the\naddition of multiple workers with no previous experience has resulted in licensing\nrule and contract/policy violations while the staff learn the job requirements and\nexpectations.\nFinancial Overview\nReviewed the agency budget as well as the independent auditor's report on\nfinancial statements, statements of financial position, statement of activities,\nstatement of functional expenses, statements of cash flows, and notes to financial",
    "statements were reviewed. While there was a decrease in revenue due to low\ncases during a portion of 2023, the agency has since accepted several cases. No\nconcerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed who are new to the agency reported the onboarding process\nhas been smooth and they are receiving adequate training, support, and\nsupervision. The staff interviewed who have been at the agency for more than a\nyear reported no concerns despite several staffing changes at the agency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office is in a building with other non-profit agency offices. The office is\nsecured through locked doors. The staff work area with space and equipment to\nprovide for foster care, licensing, and adoption service delivery is located behind a\nsecond locked door, which is also where the files are securely stored. Physical\nCHRI is stored in a locked cabinet next to a cross shredder within the Program\nManager's office.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo Safety Concerns Identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nAugust 28, 2024\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 29, 2024\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
