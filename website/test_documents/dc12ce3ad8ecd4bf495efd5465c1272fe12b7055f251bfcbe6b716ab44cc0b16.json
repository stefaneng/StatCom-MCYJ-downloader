Youth A and this unknown youth have\nalso been touching each other inappropriately on an unknown\nlocation on their bodies. No penetration has been reported but this\nhas occurred on more than one occasion. Youth A has limited\ncognition and has special education needs. It is unknown if staff\nmembers at the group home are aware of this occurring.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via phone on 9/4/2025.

Youth A\nreported not knowing who is sneaking into Youth A’s room at night\nbut described this person as a male who is short.

She\nreported a belief that Youth A does not understand the process\nstaff use at night for supervision. Administrator reported Youth A is\ngone almost every weekend for scheduled family visits and\nbecause of the bedroom doors remaining open at night and staff\nsitting in the hallway, the allegations would be impossible. She\n2",

    "6:18 13 min 6:17 6 hours 27 minutes\n6:31 13 min\n6:44 13 min\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as there is sufficient\nevidence to support staff on third shift not completing bed checks\non youth as required by rule and the facility’s policy. Two\novernight blocks of time were reviewed but during this time there\nwas a period of time exceeding 6 hours that staff did not check on\nthe well-being of youth during the overnight hours. Several times\nstaff would walk by the room without slowing their pace and\nglanced into the room rather than checking on the youth. Also,\nseveral times, staff would only look into 1 or 2 bedrooms without\nobserving youth in all three rooms within the camera view.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding staff learning to do an\nappropriate room check. Staff should be making visual\nobservations of the youth’s skin and breathing to ensure the youth\nis not in distress and present in the room. Glancing into a room\nwhile walking by is not enough to provide appropriate supervision.\nTechnical Assistance was offered regarding documenting bed\nchecks. It became apparent that staff during the two nights the\nvideo was reviewed were documenting bed checks being\ncompleted, although insufficient checks or sitting at the end of the\nhallway does not constitute bed checks. It was recommended a\nsystem that would provide more accurate accounting of bed\nchecks is put into place. This could include up to an electronic\nwand system or the use of a tablet to record the check.\nTechnical Assistance was offered regarding administration staff\ndoing a random inspection of the third shift staff by showing up at\nthe facility during the overnight hours to observe staff and check\nthe bed check logs.\nConclusion Violation Established\n14",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
