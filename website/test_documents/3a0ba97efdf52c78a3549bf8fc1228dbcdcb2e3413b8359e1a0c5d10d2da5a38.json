    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A worker of a private foster care agency, who is also a foster\nparent, used his official capacity as a private agency worker to\ninappropriately access the record of a foster youth that was in his\ncare to get updates about the case in an attempt to get the foster\nyouth back after requesting replacement. The worker was written\nup by the private agency.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nDirector X\nOn 8/21/2023, I interviewed the complainant, Director X, by\ntelephone. Additional information was provided by Director X via\nemail that same day. Director X advised that she is the Director of\nWexford/Missaukee County Department of Health and Human\nServices (DHHS). She reported Foster Care Worker (FCW) 3 is a\nlicensed foster parent with Wexford/Missaukee DHHS; and an\nemployee of Holy Cross Children’s Services-Mid-Michigan (Holy\nCross-MM). FCW 3 and his wife, Foster Parent B had Foster\nChild A in their licensed foster home, and the couple requested\nChild A’s removal. After Child A’s replacement, FCW 3 and his\nwife became remorseful about the removal and FCW 3 began\naccessing Foster Child A’s record as a FCW, which he is not for\nthis child. Director X reported their office became suspicious\nbecause of information that FCW 3 would report about the case. It\nwas information FCW 3 should not have known about. Director X\nrecalled a telephone conversation she had with FCW 3 sometime\nin mid-May of 2023. During that telephone call, FCW 3 expressed\nhis regrets over asking for Child A to be replaced; and wished to\nhave Child A moved back to his home. FCW 3 further told Director\nX he learned that Child A’s mom was going to release her parental\nrights and he and his wife are now hoping to adopt Child\nA. Director X stated at the time of the telephone call Child A had\nbeen out of FCW 3’s and his wife’s care for almost one month.\nChild A’s mother’s plan to release her parental rights was not\npublic knowledge; and it was believed that FCW 3 learned that\ninformation through him accessing MiSACWIS.\nDirector X said they reported the suspicions about FCW 3 to Holy\nCross-MM. Thereafter the agency requested a MISACWIS\nanalysis of FCW 3’s MISACWIS activity and the research showed\naccess to aspects of Child A’s record. Director X reported these\nevents were a few months back, maybe May or June of this year.\nDirector X reported after the MISACWIS research results, Holy\nCross-MM reported the matter was discussed with FCW 3 and\n3",
    "FCW 3 was disciplined. Holy Cross-MM did not tell her how FCW\n3 was disciplined.\nChief Administrator 1\nOn 8/22/2023 I interviewed Holy Cross-MM Chief Administrator\n(CA)1 about this allegation by telephone. CA 1 acknowledged\nawareness of the allegation of inappropriate access of Child A’s\nMISACWIS record by FCW 3. She reported this information was\nfirst brought to her attention back in late May or early June of 2023\nby telephone and in a subsequent meeting with\nWexford/Missaukee DHHS. CA 1 reported she thought this matter\nhad been dealt with. She voiced surprise by this complaint against\nthe agency. She confirmed that Holy Cross-MM requested\nresearch of FCW 3’s MISACWIS activities with respect to Child\nA’s case, back when the matter came to their attention. CA 1\nreported when she and Supervisor 2 met with FCW 3, FCW 3\nadmitted to accessing Child A’s record. FCW 3 did not give a\ndetailed reason for his action. FCW 3 said something to the effect\nof being curious about the status of Child A’s case. CA 1 reported\nthereafter, FCW 3 was disciplined by written disciplinary action.\nCA 1 reported outside of a coaching disciplinary action for not\nfollowing the difficulty of care approval policy, this was FCW 3’s\nfirst written disciplinary action. She reported there was no\ncorrective plan for FCW 3 with the disciplinary write up. FCW 3\nwas advised future inappropriate actions could lead to his\ntermination. I requested a copy of FCW 3’s disciplinary action. A\ncopy has not been received.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 3:\nOn 8/30/2023, I interviewed FCW 3 via TEAMS related to this\ncomplaint. FCW 3 acknowledged awareness of the complaint\nagainst him; and that he was Child A’s prior foster parent. He\nreported him and his wife, Foster Parent B, have been licensed\nfoster parents with Wexford/Missaukee DHHS since March 2021.\nHe accused Wexford/Missaukee DHHS of making this complaint.\nHe reported knowing this because on 8/28/2023\nWexford/Missaukee DHHS opened a special evaluation against\nhis and Foster Parent B’s foster home for allegations about\nconfidential information being shared. He reported this\nMISACWIS access matter was brought to his employer’s (Holy\nCross-MM) attention months ago by Wexford/Missaukee DHHS\nand his agency director addressed it with him. He said he\nadmitted to doing something wrong, that he will never do it again\nand he has not since.\n4",
    "FCW 3 admitted to searching MISACWIS using Child A’s name.\nUsing this method allowed him some access, but since he was not\nthe assigned worker for Child A in the MISACWIS system, he\ncould not see anything. He said when he clicked on Child A’s\nname it immediately kicked him off. I asked FCW 3 whether he\nattempted to gain access once or more than once. FCW 3\nreported believing that he had clicked on Child A’s name twice.\nHe then stated that he did not know if he had clicked Child A’s\nname twice, or his own name twice in MISACWIS. He also stated,\nhe would not dispute whatever the MISACWIS records shows,\nthough he denied gaining any information. I asked FCW 3, if he\nhad been able go further/gain greater access into Child A’s\nMISACWIS record would he have. FCW 3 stated “I want to\nanswer no, but I’m not sure.” FCW 3 stated he was attempting to\nobtain information about Child A’s replacement. FCW 3 clarified,\nthat statement. He stated he and his wife, Foster Parent B knew\nChild A was replaced to their respite provider, so there was no\nneed to look for Child A’s new placement location. He wanted to\nknow what Wexford/Missaukee DHHS had entered in MISACWIS\nas the reason for Child A’s placement change. He did not trust\nthat Wexford/Missaukee DHHS had put in actual information as to\nthe reason for Child A’s replacement from his home.\nAs for what his discipline entailed, FCW 3 reported it was decided\nhis inappropriate access to MISACWIS was an\nemployer/employee issue to be handled by his employer (FCW 3\ndid not indicate who/what entity made that determination or how).\nHe reported the disciplinary action Holy Cross-MM took with him\nin June of 2023 consisted of his supervisor, Supervisor 2\ninforming him of the allegation, information Holy Cross-MM had\ngathered on the matter, and a formal reprimand. FCW 3 said he\nwas told he was getting a formal reprimand, but he has not seen\nthat formal reprimand, in writing. He said he was told it was in the\nagency’s “Paycor” system, but when he checked that system the\nformal reprimand was not there. He said he was told the\nreprimand said he violated the agency’s technology policy and\nconfidentiality policy. The agency told him he could have been\nterminated. They also told him the formal reprimand is one level\nbefore termination.\nSupervisor 2\nOn 9/6/2023, I interviewed Supervisor 2 about this allegation by\ntelephone. Supervisor 2 reported this matter happened months\nago and he and his supervisor, the deputy director, addressed the\nmatter with FCW 3. He said, FCW 3 admitted to the behavior.\nFCW 3 took full responsible for his action. I asked Supervisor 2\n5",
    "what FCW 3 reported he did. Supervisor 2 said FCW 3 reported\nhe attempted to access Child A's MISACWIS record once but\ncould not get into Child A’s case. FCW 3 told them Child A was a\nprior foster child FCW 3 had fostered for two years, but nothing\nmore. FCW 3 was very remorseful about his actions.\nI asked Supervisor 2 what the agency did related to FCW 3’s\ninappropriate MISACWIS access behavior. Supervisor 2 said,\nabout a month and a half ago they reviewed the MISACWIS policy\nwith FCW 3 and advised FCW 3 he was not to engage in\nunauthorized MISACWIS access. Additionally, they entered a\n“coaching” disciplinary action into the agency’s Human Resource\n(HR) system. Supervisor 2 did not describe this discipline action\nas a written reprimand or verbal warning. When I asked him,\nwhere would a verbal coaching action fall with respect to levels of\ndiscipline actions, Supervisor 2 did not know. He reported that\nwould have to come from their HR department. He reported since\nFCW 3’s employment with the agency in December 2022, this\nissue has been the only concern reported against FCW 3.\nDocument Review\nChild A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• He was placed with FCW 3 and Foster Parent B on\n7/1/2021; and replaced to Foster Parents XXs’/his respite\nproviders on 4/24/2023.\n• He was made a Michigan Children’s Institute Ward on\n5/24/2023. His permanency plan is adoption.\nA MISACWIS Activity Review Log which showed:\n• There was no evidence in MISACWIS FCW 3 accessed\nChild A’s case record.\n• It did show FCW 3 accessed Child A’s person record on\n4/18/23 and 5/29/23. Fifteen items were accessed within\nthe record including health history and address history.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation reviewed, the evidence\nshowed FCW 3 made unauthorized access Child A’s MISACWIS\nrecord.\nIn this instance FCW 3 did not demonstrate responsible and\nsuitable character related to services to children and families as\nwould be served by the agency.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\n6",
    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff Qualification.\nSection (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nDescription and able to met the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation FCW 3, who is also a foster parent, lied under oath at a hearing,\ninsisting he never requested replacement of Child A; and the\ndepartment’s attorney produced written documentation of FCW 3’s\nrequest. There are concerns about the credibility of FCW 3 as he\nperjured himself in court as well as misused computer systems to\ngain information inappropriately.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nDirector X\nOn 8/21/2023, I interviewed the complainant, Director X, by\ntelephone. Director X reported on 8/15/2023, FCW 3 testified in\nMissaukee County Court at a court hearing for Child A, as a previous\nfoster parent for Child A foster parent. Director X reported while on\nthe stand FCW 3 testified that he never requested Child A to be\nremoved from their home, when FCW 3 had. Director X reported\nthere was evidence, by way of emails, testified to and submitted\nshowing that FCW 3 and his wife had requested Child A’s removal\nfrom their home. The judge did not charge FCW 3 with perjury.\nDirector X explained that Child A had been having respite visits\nwith another licensed foster family and FCW 3 advised that the\nrespite family was willing to keep Child A full time. Child A’s\nreplacement to the respite family ended up occurring.\nChief Administrator 1\nOn 8/22/2023 I interviewed Holy Cross-MM Chief Administrator\n(CA)1 about this allegation by telephone. CA 1 reported when\nFCW 3 began his employment with Holy Cross-MM on 12/5/2022,\nFCW 3 was already a licensed foster parent with\nWexford/Missaukee DHHS. CA 1 had no information about FCW\n3 not being truthful in court or lying on the stand about any case.\nShe reported that FCW 3 has 10 foster care cases, and she is not\naware of any concern with him testifying as a foster care worker.\nFCW 3\nOn 8/30/2023, I interviewed FCW 3 via TEAMS related to this\ncomplaint. FCW 3 denied the allegation. FCW 3 said, he and\nFoster Parent B never asked for Child A’s removal from their\nhome. He reported the replacement decision for Child A occurred\nverbally, but he admitted there is an email from him and Foster\n7",
    "Parent B agreeing to Child A being replaced. Despite that email,\nFCW 3 said he and Foster Parent B never put in a 30-day request\nasking for Child A’s removal. Additionally, they never received a\nDHS 30. They had been on the fence about this decision. He said\nChild A was having behavior issues and they wanted respite. He\nsaid they asked for Child A’s placement change; but they never\nasked for Child A to be removed. He said, Child A’s replacement\ndeal was between them and the respite provider. That they just\nagreed to Child A remaining in placement with the respite\nprovider. He said 20 hours later they wrote an email to\nWexford/Missaukee DHHS saying they regretted their decision.\nHe reported, he never lied in court about this. He reported giving\ntestimony in court about Child A’s replacement as Child A’s prior\nfoster parent, not as a foster worker on the case. He said the\nMISACWIS inappropriate access matter never came up in court.\nHe reported he was legally advised to indicate that matter was\nhandled by his employer with disciplinary action. He reported this\ncomplaint is questioning his creditability and his job and he has\nnever been accused of not being creditable.\nSupervisor 2\nOn 9/6/2023, I interviewed Supervisor 2 by telephone. Supervisor\n2 did not have information related to this allegation.\nDocument Review\nChild A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• He was placed with FCW 3 and Foster Parent B on\n7/1/2021 and replaced to Foster Parents XXs’ home, his\nrespite providers, on 4/24/2023.\n• He was made a Michigan Children’s Institute Ward on\n5/24/2023. His permanency plan is adoption.\nFCW 3 and Foster Parent B’s CWLM case record which showed:\n• They received their original foster home license on\n3/23/2021.\n• A special evaluation report dated 10/12/2023 related to\nallegations the foster parents shared confidential\ninformation about Child A’s case. Additionally, that the\nfoster parents lied in court when questioned. The special\nevaluation found FCW 3 and Foster Parent B in compliance\nrelated to the former allegation and in violation of the foster\nhome applicant/licensee qualifications rule R400.9201(1)(e)\nrelated to the latter allegation. The special evaluation\nconcluded FCW 3 was not honest when questioned in\ncourt. A corrective action plan was recommended, and it\nwas pending.\n8",
    "Analysis Based on interviews the evidence showed:\n• FCW 3’s testimony in court was that as a foster parent, not\nas a worker with responsibility over Child A’s case.\n• It is not clear that FCW 3 made deliberate false statement\nin court about him and his wife requesting Child A’s\nremoval, but seemingly made statements in court related\nto his perception of how Child A’s removal and\nreplacement decision came to be. As such his reporting\nwould not have been perceived as truthful, especially due\nto his written statement asking for the child’s replacement.\nAdditionally, the judge did not find that FCW 3 perjured\nhimself in court.\n• In this instance there is insufficient evidence to support\nthat FCW 3 did not demonstrate responsible and suitable\ncharacter related to services to children and families\nserved by the agency.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\nOctober 16, 2023\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/19/23\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n9"
