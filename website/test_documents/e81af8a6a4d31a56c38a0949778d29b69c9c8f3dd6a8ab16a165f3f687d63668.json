    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Facility is allowed to use the Psychiatric Consent form from youth’s prior\nplacement as long as it has the youth’s information, prescribing physician, and\ncurrent medication information.\n• An incident report must be completed for each restraint hold.\n• Incident reports must be entered into MiSACWIS within 24 hours and approved\nwithin 72 hours.\n• Notification must be sent to DCWL consultant whenever a youth’s behaviors\nresult in contact with law enforcement.\n• DCWL approved a youth to be provided temporary one on one programing in\nthe classroom area away from the population of the Shelter Program due to\nthe youth’s emotional unpredictability and attempting to kill the other youth in\nthe shelter. The Qualified Fire Inspector (QFI ) has approved the classroom as\nan isolation bedroom, as it has two exits and there would be one on one\nstaffing. There will be a privacy screened sleeping area in the classroom. The\nclassroom is not locked and there is a bathroom right outside the door. Youth\nwill shower when the other youth are at the dining hall area. As the QFI\napproved the classroom based on the bedroom requirements, this does not\nrequire a variance. But this is different than normal, as the classroom was not\napproved for that use upon original licensure.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• A review of the audit process was conducted with the case manager. This\nreview included the rules and a review of the audit workbook tool.\n• Discussion was had with Chief Administrator regarding the seclusion\nvariance’s that are being approved for the detention population and the\nprocess of requesting a variance was reviewed.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were three substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period. The Chief Administrator placed one of the staff on leave until the\nconclusion of the investigation at which time the staff’s employement was\nterminated; one of the staff was placed on a safety plan and resigned during the\ninvestigation; and one of the staff was placed on a safety plan throughout the\ninvestigation and resigned once the investigation was concluded. A meeting was\nheld with the facility leadership on November 28, 2023, at which time staffing was\ndiscussed. Concerns about the lack of adequate staffing and the decisions the\nstaff are making after being trained was addressed with the leadership. The Chief\nAdminstrator reporeted they are enhancing the training, creating expecations for",
    "leadership to be a presence on the units on all shifts, and having leadership take\non more of mentoring responsibility for the new staff at this time.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period. The CAP’s were approved on October 31, 2023 and\nNovember 28, 2023. The facility’s corrective action plan compliance is monitored\nquarterly, and first review will be completed in December 2023.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nFinancial Overview:\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on a review of the facility’s budget\nand the agency’s financial audit.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator completed an assessment of the program dated\nDecember 1, 2023. The assessment addresses the staffing shortage that the\nfacility struggles to overcome, and the extensive mental health needs of the youth\nplaced outside the scope of the program. The Chief Administrator continues to\nassess the areas of ongoing need and growth within the teams. The assessment\nreports a trend for staff not performing to the standards the facility expects which is\nbeing addressed by continuing to grow and develop staff through staff training.\nThe assessment also indicated a need to improve documentation for accuracy,\ntimeliness, and overall compliance. The Chief Administrator’s corrective action\nplans have begun to be implemented and they report compliance at this time.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nYouth from both the detention and shelter programs were interviewed. Three of\nfour of the youth report feeling safe at the facility, one reported feeling unsafe due\nto the behaviors of the other youth in the program. The youth that reported feeling\nunsafe reported the staff do “all they can” to stop the unsafe youth however she\nstill feels unsafe around specific peers. All four youth reported having all their\nneeds met by the staff, including crisis counseling as needed. None of the youth\nreported concerns with the way in which the staff treat them or with the program.\nStaff from different area of the program were interviewed. All staff report having\nthe training required by the rules. The staff all reported they felt well prepared\nthrough the training to work with the youth. The staff said they feel supported by\ndirect supervisors and administration. There were no concerns noted by any of the\nstaff members interviewed.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of the facility occurred on December 7,\n2023. There were no issues or safety concerns noted. The youth all have",
    "appropriate bedrooms and bathroom with adequate supplies. The medications are\ndouble locked. The signage required by the rules is posted in the appropriate\nareas at the facility. The kitchen was clean and menus for the youth were posted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n___________________________________ December 14, 2023\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 15, 2023\n___________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
