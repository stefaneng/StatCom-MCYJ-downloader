The child has not had a wheelchair that fits since July\n2022 due to outgrowing it and the agency has refused to provide\nanother one until her insurance provides such in March 2023.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nParent B\nOn 12/20/2023 I interviewed Parent B/complainant by telephone.\nParent B confirmed the information in the complaint. She reported\nChild A is eight years old and has been in care with Ennis-Howell\nsince 6/8/2022. She reported the agency had opportunity to obtain\nthe wheelchair in November 2022, when she and the caregiver\nwent to order the equipment. Ennis refused to get the wheelchair,\nreported they do not have the money, and Child A would have to\nget the new wheelchair when the insurance provider can pay for it,\nwhich is not until March 2023.\nProgram Director (PD) 2\n2",
    "On 1/11/2023 I interviewed Program Director 2 onsite. PD 2\nreported reviewing the case record upon receipt of this complaint.\nHe reported when Child A was placed with the agency on\n6/8/2022, she came with a wheelchair. He said there were no\nconcerns known about the wheelchair until after Child A was\nplaced with Caregiver 4. He said the issue of Child A’s wheelchair\nbeing too small did not come to the attention of the assigned\nworker, Foster Care Worker (FCW), until 10/25/2022. PD 2\nreported knowing this because of an email FCW 4 sent the POS\n(Purchase of Service) Department of Health and Human Services\n(DHHS) Worker asking for assistance, due to Child A getting too\nbig for her wheelchair. The DHHS Worker referred FCW 4 to\nChild A’s insurance provider. He said it was going to take three\nmonths to get a new wheelchair via Child A’s insurance.\nPD 2 said Parent B told the worker Child A’s wheelchair had come\nfrom the school Child A attended while in Parent B’s care.\nAdditionally, that the school would give updated wheelchairs.\nEnnis contacted the school and the school reported they provide\nor would help with getting an updated wheelchair to a child who\nhas outgrown a wheelchair or has a damaged wheelchair. PD 2\nreported the agency did not seek assistance via the school\nbecause they were advised Child A would have to be enrolled with\nthe school and Child A had not been enrolled there since 2018.\nPD 2 said Caregiver D intervened after FCW 4 had checked with\nthe insurance company. Caregiver D ordered a wheelchair on her\nown on 11/30/2022. A wheelchair came but it was not appropriate\nas it did not have the harness scraps required to secure Child A\nin, so the wheelchair had to be sent back. PD 2 reported the\norder was wrong and it was Caregiver D’s error. He did not know\nhow Caregiver 2 knew how to go about ordering a specialized\nwheelchair or how she got the wrong kind of wheelchair. He said\nit was just Caregiver D trying to get something sooner for Child A.\nHe reported a reordered wheelchair would not come until\nsometime in March 2023. It would take three months to make the\nwheelchair. He reported as of 1/4/2023 the agency, per a doctor’s\nsuggestions began exploring renting a wheelchair for Child A. He\ndenied the caregiver ever complaining about Child A being without\nan appropriate wheelchair.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 3\nOn 1/11/2023 I interviewed FCW 3 onsite. FCW 3 reported being\nassigned to Child A’s case on 10/24/2022. She reported being\nunaware of an issue with Child A’s wheelchair until after the\nreceipt of this complaint. Prior to this complaint Parent B, nor\n3",
    "Caregiver D had complained or reported a concern about Child\nA’s wheelchair being too small.\nFCW 3 reported prior to this complaint, she had an initial visit with\nthe child and Caregiver D on 11/14/2022. She had transported\nChild A from a grandparents’ visit to Caregiver D’s. She had put\nChild A’s wheelchair in her truck but did not notice an issue with it.\nShe did not see Child A in the wheelchair at that time. She\nreported at some point Caregiver D informed her they had ordered\na wheelchair, but when it arrived, it was the incorrect one and it\ndid not have the straps and could not be buckled into the bus for\ntransport. FCW 3 did not know from where Caregiver D obtained\nthe wheelchair. Caregiver D had ordered the wheelchair, but not\nby going through the proper channels. After an incorrect\nwheelchair came in, the family used the proper medical channel,\nvia Dr X and Sparrow medical equipment for the reorder. FCW 3\nreported Caregiver D informed her there was an appointment at\n“Sparrows” a medical equipment place in Lansing on 11/30/2022.\nCaregiver D did not report the current wheelchair was preventing\nher from transporting Child A.\nFCW 3 reported on 1/3/2023 she made a home visit, observed\nChild A in the wheelchair, but could not tell if the wheelchair was\ntoo small. Nor was she able to discern whether Child A was\nuncomfortable in the wheelchair. She acknowledged it did look as\nif the wheelchair could be bigger. She said Caregiver D reported\nChild A’s current wheelchair is a 10-inch size, and the new one\nthat was ordered was a 12 or 14 inch one. She affirmed PD 2’s\nreporting related to March 2023 expected date for the new\nwheelchair. FCW 3 said, “I didn’t feel it was a real disadvantage\nfor the new wheelchair to not come until March 2023 because I\ndidn’t see it was a problem” and Caregiver D was working on\ngetting the wheelchair.\nFCW 3 reported the agency was attempting to obtain another\nwheelchair for Child A sooner, by renting one. She said on\n1/4/2023 she contacted the Sparrow medical facility about renting\none. She was advised to speak with their warehouse and at the\ntime of this interview, she was awaiting a reply.\nCaregiver C\nOn 1/27/2023 I interviewed Caregiver C by telephone. Caregiver\nC reported Child A’s placement with her as 6/6/2022 until\n10/3/2022. She said DHHS placed Child A with her and\ntransferred Child A’s case to Ennis.\n4",
    "Caregiver C reported prior to Child A starting school in September\n2022, there was not an issue with Child A’s wheelchair. She said\nduring the summer Child A gained a lot of weight. While at school\nthey noticed bruising on the area between Child A’s thighs and\nnear the bone area where the wheelchair strap fits. Caregiver C\nsaid she reported the wheelchair issue to FCW 4 around\n9/20/2022. FCW 4 told her FCW 4 would work on getting Child A\na new wheelchair, but then FCW 4 resigned from Ennis and Child\nA was replaced to Caregiver C aunt’s, Caregiver D. Caregiver C\nreported Child A does not currently have a functional wheelchair.\nCaregiver D\nOn 1/27/2023 I interviewed Caregiver D by telephone. Caregiver\nD reported Child A was placed with her on 10/3/2022, but Child A\nis returning to Child A’s mother’s care today.\nCaregiver D reported for the first month of Child A’s placement\nwith her, FCW 4 was the worker. Caregiver D reported letting the\nagency know there was as issue with Child A’s wheelchair “almost\nfrom the beginning” of Child A’s placement with her. She said the\nagency knew already, because Child A's prior placement,\nCaregiver C had told them the wheelchair was too small. She\nreported just before she put in her 30-day request to have Child A\nreplaced from her home on 1/6/2023, the agency told her they\nwere trying to rent Child A a wheelchair. Caregiver D never heard\nback from the worker on the rental issue/status.\nCaregiver D acknowledged trying to obtain a new wheelchair for\nChild A. She did that by calling the Carelink insurance and having\nthe doctor Child A was seeing to write a prescription for the\nwheelchair. She said when the wheelchair came it was a regular\nold wheelchair. She affirmed PD 2’s and FCW 3’s reporting about\nit not having the necessary straps for bus lock in/for safety\nsecurement. She said Medicaid paid for the wheelchair, but since\nit was returned there was no charge incurred. Thereafter, they\nwent to an equipment place for measurements for Child A. That\noccurred on 11/30/2022, at which time she was told it would take\nthree months to build it. Caregiver D reported telling all this to the\nagency and she was advised to just wait.\nCaregiver D reported there was only an issue getting Child A\naround when they needed to take her places. She said the\nagency assisted with transportation, but Child A was just too wide\nand had outgrown the wheelchair.\nDocument Review:\n5",
    "On 1/11/2023, I examined Child A’s case record and/or I was\nprovided the document. I reviewed:\n• MISACWIS which showed:\n➢ Child A was placement with Ennis-Howell on\n6/8/2022.\n➢ She was placed with Caregiver C, an aunt, from\n6/8/2022 to 10/4/2022.\n➢ She was placed with Caregiver D, another\naunt/relative on 10/4/2022.\n➢ A medical for Child A dated 6/24/2022 that indicated\nChild A is diagnosed with Jacobson’s Syndrome; is\nnon-verbal; does not walk; has severe Autism delay;\nhas heart issues; and had surgery for a congenital\nheart defect seven days ago.\n➢ A copy of a 10/25/2022 email from FCW 4 to Child\nA’s DHHS-POS worker. The email indicated Child A\nis “very close to being too big for her wheelchair.\nAre there any resources you are aware of that I can\nutilize to assist the family in obtaining one? The\nDHHS-POS worker referred FCW 4 to the child’s\ninsurance company.\n• No documentation of a report by Caregiver C related to a\nwheelchair need, but a 10/28/2022 agency home visit sheet\nthat indicated Child A needs a new wheelchair.\n• A photo of Child A sitting in a wheelchair, in which Child A\nappears to completely fill in the seat with no apparent extra\nroom.\nAnalysis Based on interviews, the agency did not timely and effectively\nfollow up on Child A’s need for a larger wheelchair. The delay, and\nlack of direct communication with the child’s second caregiver\naround the wheelchair and what would be needed to secure a\nproper wheelchair, contributed to a wheelchair not being secured\ntimely.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12409 Education Policy.\nSection (1) An agency’s education policy shall ensure that, within 5 school\nDescription days of placement, an agency shall provide for the enrollment of\neach child of school age, as defined by state law, into a school\nprogram.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The foster child had only attended school one day out of the\nschool year.\n6",
    "Investigation Interviews:\nParent B\nOn 12/20/2023 I interviewed Parent B/Complainant by telephone.\nParent B reported Child A is not in school and has not been in\nschool since she was placed with Caregiver D in October 2022.\nAdditionally, that when Child A was placed with Parent B’s sister,\nCaregiver C, Caregiver C only sent Child A to school one day.\nParent B said, Child A used to attend Beekman Center in Lansing.\nThe agency promised when Child A moved to Caregiver D, who\nlives two hours away from Lansing, they would get Child A placed\nin a special education school. The agency has not secured a\nschool for Child A, nor services that they promised her.\nProgram Director (PD) 2\nOn 1/11/2023 I interviewed Program Director 2 onsite. PD 2\nreported it is true that Child A is not enrolled in school and has\nbasically not been attending school since being in Ennis’s care.\nHe said FCW 4 was working on getting Child A in school. In mid-\nAugust thru 9/29/2022 FCW 4 sought to obtain Child A’s\nattendance records from Beekman, the school Child A had\nattended in Lansing, while in her mother’s care. The agency did\nnot discover until sometime later, that school had no records and\nthat Child A had only attended that school for one day, contrary to\nwhat Parent B had reported. PD did not report what other types of\nfollow up the agency attempted to get Child A in school/to work\nthrough whatever barriers existed.\nPD 2 reported Child A missed school while placed with Caregiver\nC, due to COVID and other issues. He reported when Child A\nwas placed with Caregiver D, FCW 4 spoke with someone in the\nschool district in September or October about getting Child A\nenrolled. That person did not contact FCW 4 back for 21 days and\nby that time FCW 4 was leaving the agency. He said FCW 3\npicked up the case on 10/24/2022, and FCW 3 contacted the\nFoster Care Liaison Representative (FCLR) for assistance on\n11/17/2022. The FCLR referred FCW 3 to the Greenville\nIntermediate School District (ISD). He said there was a gap in\ncontact thereafter and FCW 3 followed up with the ISD on\n1/4/2023, but Child A remains out of school.\nFoster Care Worker 3\nOn 1/11/2023 I interviewed FCW 3 onsite. FCW 3 reported when\nshe took over Child A’s case on 10/24/2022, Child A was not in\nschool. Nor was Child A in school at the time of this interview.\n7",
    "FCW 3 was not sure what school Child A would now be attending\nbecause Caregiver D has requested Child A’s replacement.\nFCW 3 reported FCW 4 had informed her that FCW 4 was\nattempting to register Child A in Vestaburg schools. FCW 4 was\ntrying to obtain a release of information in order to get Child A\nrecords. FCW 3 said she did not know until after the fact that a\nVestaburg school representative had contacted FCW 4, so, she\ndid not know to do anything else. She did not follow up on school\nuntil 11/14/2022. She contacted the FCLR as reported by PM 2.\nShe was advised the school district would do the necessary\ntesting, paper work, and would transfer Child A to the ISD. FCW 3\nreported after that, she contacted Vestaburg schools and spoke\nwith the Special Education Coordinator (SEC) who recalled Child\nA's case as reported by FCW 4. The SEC affirmed the information\nreported by the FCLR, though nothing was reported related to a\nrelease of information. Follow up and appointment scheduling\nwas pending for Child A. FCW 3 said she followed up on the\nmatter once in December 2022, and the SEC was not available for\nabout a month after that. FCW 3 said she finally spoke with the\nSEC on 1/4/2023. The SEC scheduled an intake school\nregistration meeting for 1/12/2023 at 1:00PM. At that time Child\nA, Caregiver D, and Parent B would meet with someone from the\nISD along with the school psychologist and a teacher’s consultant.\nFCW 3 said the 1/12/2023 appointment now has to be\nrescheduled. Parent B has a conflicting appointment, and Parent\nB reports she cannot reschedule her appointment. A new\nappointment cannot go forward because Parent B has to be there\nto sign the paperwork. FCW 3 said she gave Parent B the TEC’s\ntelephone number. FCW 3 reported, she is trying to get Parent\nB’s consent on this matter, but Parent B’s cooperation has always\nbeen a struggle. Parent B believes Child A is coming back home\nto her, and this may be why Parent B does not cooperate.\nAdditionally, information Parent B reports is many times not\ncorrect, and also not truthful. Parent B said Child A’s school\nrecords were at Harwood, where Parent B obtained Child A’s\nwheelchair, and the school provides updated wheelchairs every\nfive years. All of this was revealed to be untrue. Hardwood\nreported Child A was enrolled in their school in January 2018 and\ndisenrolled in February 2018. The school reported never seeing\nChild A or Parent B.\nCaregiver C\nOn 1/27/2023 I interviewed Caregiver C by telephone. Caregiver\nC said Child A was not in school when Child A was first placed\nwith her because it was summer. She said Child A was not\n8",
    "enrolled in school until the middle of September 2022, because\nthe worker was delinquent in getting her the permission form to\nenroll Child A. She also had to get the IEP (Individualized\nEducation Plan) from the Hardwood school, and she had to obtain\nChild A’s birth certificate from Parent B. Caregiver C said Child A\nonly attended school for a week, because soon after Child A\nstarted, Child A’s placement change occurred.\nCaregiver C reported Child A has not been in school during all the\ntime Child A had been placed with Caregiver D. She said that is\nbecause there are no schools in the area Caregiver D resides.\nCaregiver D\nOn 1/27/2023 I interviewed Caregiver D by telephone. Caregiver\nD reported residing in Montcalm County, in Vestaburg Michigan.\nShe confirmed that Child A had not attended school since\nplacement with her, on 10/3/2022. She acknowledged monthly\nhome visits by the agency workers but could not recall the specific\ndiscussions related to school. She reported for the first month of\nChild A’s placement with her, FCW 4 was the worker. She said\nboth FCW 3 and FCW 4 kept telling her they were trying to get\nChild A placed in school. They reported they were contacting the\nVestaburg school district, and no one was calling them back.\nNeither worker asked her to go up to the school. She said she\nwould have gone, but she was under the impression the agency\nstaff were to do that. She reported earlier this month, FCW 3\nreported obtaining an appointment with the Vestaburg school\ndistrict and a meeting was set for 1/10/2023 or 1/12/2023 to\ndiscuss Child A's school placement. That meeting has since been\ncancelled because of her 30-day request to have Child A replaced\nfrom her home, and Parent B was not being okay with signing the\nneeded school paperwork for the meeting.\nDocument Review:\nOn 12/20/2022 I reviewed Child A’s MISAWIS record. On\n1/11/2023, I examined Child A’s physical case record, or I was\nprovided the document. I reviewed:\n• The information as previously reported.\n• A Team Decision Meeting (TDM) on 10/3/22 that indicated\nChild A is enrolled at the Beekman Center school. She will\nbe enrolled at a special education school in the St. Louis\narea which is closer to her new placement.\n• Child A’s Initial Service Plan (ISP) for 6/8/2022-7/7/2022,\nwhich documented a 6/17/2022 home visit with Caregiver C\nindicating Caregiver C is working on getting Child A\n9",
    "enrolled in Harwood elementary in Mason, Michigan where\nChild A had previously attended for a couple of days.\n• A 7/5/2022 Family Team Meeting (FTM) that indicated the\nworker will work with the family to decide which school will\nbe best for Child A and getting her enrolled.\n• Child A’s Updated Service Plan (USP) for 7/8/2022-\n10/5/2022 which indicated via a 9/6/2022 caregiver visit\ncontact, that Child A will be attending the Beekman school\nCenter. Child A will go a couple of days per week and will\ntransition to five days a week. The school will provide\ntherapy to Child A during school hours. Additionally, a\n9/9/2022 social work contact indicating Parent B\naccompanied Child A and Caregiver C to complete Child\nA’s school enrollment. Child A will begin on 9/13/2022.\n• A copy of a 10/10/2022 email to FCW 4 from the Lansing\nschool district, and FCW 4’s confirmation response. The\nemail asked for confirmation of what Caregiver C reported\nto the school about Child A being placed with another\nfamily outside the Lansing School District. The school\nwanted confirmation of that so that Child A could be\nunenrolled with the district.\n• An MISACWIS upload of a 11/29/2017 Ingham County\nSchool District Individualized Educational Program Team\nReport.\n• A MISACWIS school profile document upload for Beekman\nCenter for Child A’s school enrollment on 8/29/2022 while\nwith Caregiver C. No school enrollment document related\nto placement with Caregiver D.\n• Copies of Ennis home visit sheets for:\n➢ 6/17/2022 that indicated Child A has not been\nattending school.\n➢ 10/28/2022 that indicated Child A is not in school\nyet. Need to contact St. Louis Schools.\n➢ 11/14/2022 that indicated look into Greenville\nSchools. No other details were listed.\n➢ 12/9/2022 that indicated Child A is not in school yet.\nNo plan of action was indicated.\n• Copies of emails back and forth from 1/9/2023 to 1/11/2023\nbetween FPD 2, FCW3, Parent B and the SEC related to\ngetting Child A registered for school.\n➢ The SEC ended the matter by advising PD 2 that\nnotwithstanding his reference to the law, no one has\nfilled out the registration paperwork. That the\nprocess to have Child A registered is to obtain the\nIEP and evaluation/medical records, and then the\nteam determines placement. That with the extensive\n10",
    "needs Child A may have this process is especially\nimportant. The SEC advised meeting as planned on\n1/12/2022 and having the team to join once the SEC\nhas more information.\n➢ FCW 3 advised the SEC that since the agency had\nnot received a registration form prior, the plan was to\ncomplete it at the appointment on 1/12/2023.\nAnalysis The evidence showed the agency did not enroll Child A in school\nafter she was placed with Caregiver D as required by the rule. Nor\ndid the agency follow up timely on issues related to securing a\nspecialized educational program for Child A. The agency did not\nmake diligent efforts until after the receipt of this complaint.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency has not provided the foster child with promised\nAutism services or physical therapy.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nParent B\nOn 12/20/2023 I interviewed Parent B/complainant by telephone.\nParent B reported the agency is reporting there are no physical\ntherapy providers in the area that Caregiver D resides. The\nagency just makes excuses as to why they have not obtained the\nservices. The agency also reported they would get Child A in\nhome services for Autism, but they have not done so. The agency\nreports they are waiting on a referral or waiting on a call.\nParent B reported not believing the agency’s reporting. She stated\nChild A has not received physical therapy since the summer of\n2022, nor the services Child A needs.\nProgram Director (PD) 2\nOn 1/11/2023 I interviewed Program Director 2 onsite. PD 2\nreported it was true Child A is diagnosed with Autism. He said\nParent B reported that Child A had received physical therapy\n11",
    "service related to this disorder in the past. He reported that would\nbe assessed via a CMH (Community Mental Health) screening\nwith Parent B’s participation, but Parent B can be difficult, and that\nat times Parent B has not signed all required releases. PD 2\nbelieves Child A may have been receiving physical and\noccupational therapy, via Sparrow, while in the care of Caregiver\nC. With respect to these services while Child A was with Caregiver\nD, PD 2 reported the agency asked Caregiver D to complete the\nscreening so that a service intake could occur, but that did not\noccur.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 3\nOn 1/11/2023 I interviewed FCW 3 onsite. FCW 3 said Child A\nwas receiving physical and occupational services while placed\nwith Caregiver C. Child A received the services via the Sparrow\nHealth System, but Child A only attended nine sessions between\nJune 2022 and October 2022. FCW 3 said she called to get\ninformation about the services for the case service plan, but\nParent B would not sign the release of information.\nFCW 3 said when Child A was replaced to Caregiver D’s home,\nshe did not know she needed a referral for these services to\ncontinue. She did not do anything about it, and she was not sure\nwhether Caregiver D knew if another referral was needed. FCW 3\nreported she completed a new referral on 1/4/2023 via Montcalm\nCare network related to these services. An appointment was set\nfor 1/10/2023. The appointment was cancelled by the service\nprovider because Parent B would only sign the consent to treat,\nbut not the consent to bill Medicaid. FCW 3 reported now that\nChild A will be leaving Caregiver D’s home, the agency will work\non these services again at a later date, as opposed to fighting with\nParent B now.\nFCW 3 reported reviewing Child A’s file related to assessing\nwhether other service referral existed and were followed up on for\nChild A’s. She saw an order for ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat),\npediatric gastro, and neurologist. She contacted Dr X’s office and\nspoke with someone a number of times. On 1/3/2023 she spoke\nwith someone at Dr X’s office about the referrals made in June\n2022. The doctor’s office reported not knowing whether Caregiver\nC had followed up on those orders, or whether the service\nproviders did not contact Caregiver C. FCW 3 said, Dr. X\nreissued the referrals. She said Parent B, with the exception of\nconsenting for an annual cardiologist (Parent B said the last one\nwas in 2018) examination, is refusing to consent to the other\nappointments. Parent B reported on 1/3/2023 and 1/5/2023 that\n12",
    "Child A needs to see a genetics doctor via the University of\nMichigan and needs an appointment to see an optometrist. FCW 3\nsaid Dr X sent out the order for the latter two service requests on\n1/5/2023.\nCaregiver C\nOn 1/27/2023 I interviewed Caregiver C by telephone. Caregiver\nC reported Child A was receiving occupational and physical\ntherapy via the Sparrow Health System in Lansing, during Child\nA’s placement time with her. She transported Child A for these\nservices one to three time weekly. Child A attended for at least\nthree months or more prior to Child A starting school in September\n2022.\nCaregiver C reported it was true that Child A was in need of\nservices related to Child A’s Autism. She said that is why Child A\nwas receiving occupational and physical therapy. Child A was also\nreceiving speech therapy. All were occurring about once per\nweek. The services had been recommended via an evaluation by\nSparrow Health System. Caregiver C reported once school\nstarted Child A was to receive those services via the school\nsystem not Sparrow. She said the school held a Multiple\nDisciplinary Team meeting related to all the services Child A\nneeded. The school was going to provide the services, but then\nChild A was replaced from her home. She said the only\ndocumentation Sparrow provider her was a list of service dates,\nwhich she provided to FCW 4.\nCaregiver D\nOn 1/27/2023 I interviewed Caregiver D by telephone. Caregiver\nD reported the agency reported they were trying to get Child A\nthese services via the school district.\nDocument Review\nOn 1/11/2023, I examined Child A case record which showed:\n• A medical document that indicated Child A received\nphysical and occupational therapy at Sparrow Health\nCenter in Lansing on 6/29/2022.\nAnalysis Based interviews there is sufficient evidence that the agency did\nnot obtain, or seek to timely obtain, continuing autism services for\nChild A related to physical, occupational and speech therapy after\nshe was placed with Caregiver D.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\n13",

At an October 2022 hearing the judge asked Child A’s\nprior Ennis worker, about the drug testing and the worker\nindicated she did not complete it. Parent B said the agency did\nhelp her obtain a psychological, that was needed before\nunsupervised visitations could occur, but then the agency said she\ncould not have unsupervised visits until she got the drug testing,\nwhich the agency refused to do. Parent B reported the judge\nadvised the agency to get Child A back to her as soon as\npossible, but the agency is not doing so. Parent B reported the\nagency seems to want to drag her case out so that the agency\ncan continue to receive specialized funds.\nProgram Director (PD) 2\nOn 1/11/2023 I interviewed Program Director 2 onsite. PD 2\nreported Parent B was not cooperative related with services.\nAdditionally, it was reported that although Child A’s adjudication\noccurred 8/1/2022, the agency did not have a dispositional order\nfor Parent B related to completing services until 10/31/2022. He\nsaid the agency referred Parent B for a psychological and\nsubstance abuse via PATS (Prevention and Training Services) on\n10/12/2022. He said the court ordered the drug and alcohol\nscreen on 10/27/2022, but Parent B did not want regular drug\ntesting. Parent B wanted hair follicle testing, which per FCW 3’s\nconsultation with DHHS would be too expensive.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 3\nOn 1/11/2023 I interviewed FCW 3 onsite. FCW 3 reported there\nis no court order ordering drug screen testing. She said the court\n14",
    "ordered a psychological and substance abuse assessment for\nParent B in October 2022 and that was completed. She went over\nthe assessment with Parent B in November 2022. She said there\nwere concerns in the assessment related to Parent B’s honesty,\nand past diagnostic and substance abuse history. Due to Parent\nB’s distrust of anyone working in “the system,” the psychologist\nrecommended that Parent B have hair follicle testing. FCW 3\nreported DHHS advised that they would not pay for that type of\ntesting. She advised Parent B if Parent B wanted hair follicle\ntesting Parent B would have to pay for it.\nFCW 3 said she referred Parent B for the therapeutic service type\nas was suggested in Parent B’s psychological assessment. On\n12/21/2022 Parent B reported she was attending her first\nappointment that coming Friday. Parent B later reported attending\nfour sessions and that she had signed a release of information.\nFCW 3 tried to get confirmation of Parent B’s compliance with the\ntherapy via phone calls and email to the therapist, without\nsuccess. The therapist reported there was no release of\ninformation on file.\nFCW 3 reported referring Parent B for PAT (Prevention and\nTraining Services) drug testing in December 2022. Parent B was\nto attend twice a week. FCW 3 was not sure if Parent B followed\nthrough/ complied. She said so as to reduce concerns by Parent\nB, she left it up to Parent B to set up the testing with a provider\nParent B selected, as opposed to one FCW 3 designated.\nDocument Review:\nOn 1/11/2023, I examined Child A’s case record or was provided\nrelated documentation.

    "Allegation During the investigation it was alleged an agency staff was\ncarrying Child A during transports. It was reported a staff person\nwas trying to have Child A, who cannot walk, to walk on the cold\nground without shoes.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 1/17/2023 Chief Administrator 1 contacted me by email about\nthis issue. She reported Child A’s maternal grandparents sent a\nvideo to PD 2 about the issue on 1/13/2023. Chief Administrator\n1’s email to me indicated:\n• The video showed Ennis’ case aide struggling to carry\nChild A from the car to the front door of Child A’s\ngrandparent’s home where she was visiting for respite.\n• The video showed Child A wore socks and did not have\nshoes or thicker socks to protect and keep her feet warm.\n• The video showed during the struggle Child A’s feet\ntouched the ground as the case aide was re-adjusting her\ngrip.\n• The agency understands there is a training need for the\nstaff to learn how to transport a disabled youth safely and\nproperly, and to ensure the youth are always dressed\nappropriately for the weather.\n• When the agency questioned the case aide why Child A’s\nwheelchair was not used, the staff expressed concerns with\nthe mother citing the wheelchair was too small and caused\ndiscomfort to Child A.\n• The agency is looking to provide Child A with a new wheel\nchair because she has yet to receive the chair that was\npreviously ordered for her.\n• In regard to training staff, they have advised staff to not\ncarry Child A during transporting and to ensure Child A is\nalways appropriately dressed in appropriate footwear in the\nform of shoes/boots or thick socks to ensure her feet are\nwarm.\n• The agency is also seeking training from medical\nprofessionals to conduct an agency training on proper use\nof a wheelchair.\nChief Administrator 1 provided me copy of a video sent to PD 2 by\nChild A’s grandparents.\nCaregiver C\nDuring my telephone interview with Caregiver C on 1/27/2023,\nCaregiver C reported Child A does not currently have a functional\nwheelchair. She said agency staff are carrying Child A around.\nShe said during one incident a couple of weeks ago she had to\nassist the transporter in strapping Child A in the car seat. In\n17",
    "another incident the transport worker was trying to have Child\nwalk. She said Child A cannot really walk, but Child A is trying to\nwalk. She reported it was cold out and Child A’s feet were on the\nground and the child did not have shoes on. Caregiver C was not\nsure who those workers were but reported there is a video.\nCaregiver D\nDuring my telephone interview with Caregiver D on 1/27/2023, she\nreported knowledge of a worker, not the FCW, carrying Child A\nout the car and almost dropping her. Caregiver D saw the video,\nnot the actual incident. She said the worker was holding Child A’s\nhand to let Child A walk. She affirmed what Caregiver C reported\nrelated to Child A being able to take a few steps and her not\nhaving shoes on during the incident.\nCase Aide 5\nOn 2/28/ 2023, Interviewed Case Aide 5 by telephone. Case Aide\n5 reported after she took Child A out of the car seat and the car,\nCase Aide 5’s arms failed her. Child A was in her arms, but she\ncould not pick Child A up. She tried again to pick Child A up, but\nher arms failed her again. She tried to lean Child A up against the\ncar, but she could not get Child A positioned correctly. While still\nholding on to Child A, she momentarily placed Child A on the\nground in a standing position. Child A took a couple of steps and\nwhile Child A was standing on the ground, Case Aide 5 was able\nto grip Child A from behind/from under Child A’s arms and lift her\nup to carry her. Case Aide 5 reported Child A’s grandfather came\nout as Child A took the couple of steps. The grandfather did not\noffer her any assistance. The grandfather asked what was going\non and commented on Child A feet being on the ground, possibly\ngetting cold. Case Aide 5 said she apologized to the grandfather\nfor letting Child A down with just her socks on.\nCase Aide 5 reported she did not transport Child A with a\nwheelchair. She was told by FCW 3 the wheelchair was to\nsmall/did not fit Child A, so she assumed the chair was not safe.\nAdditionally, Case Aide 5 acknowledged that it was not\nappropriate that Child A was only in her socks. She said in the\npast Child A has had shoes on. She reported when she picked\nChild A up from Caregiver D’s home for the transport to the\ngrandparents, Caregiver D said Child A had kicked off her shoes.\nCase Aide 5 assumed the shoes were in Child A’s bag, that\nCaregiver D had placed them there, but she did not check. When\nshe arrived at the grandparents’ home, she looked in the bag for\nthe shoes and discovered the caregiver had not sent them. She\nsaid she did not have the grandparent contact information to call\n18",
    "them for assistance. She reported not getting a chance to call the\nagency for the information because of things transpiring as they\nhad. She reported after this incident she knows the grandparents\nand Parent B were upset with FCW 4 about the incident. Case\nAide 5 said her supervisor spoke with her about the incident. Her\nsupervisor advised her to make sure the child always has her\nshoes.\nVideo Review:\nI reviewed the video that was provided by Chief Administrator 1 on\n1/17/2023. The video showed:\n• Actions similar to what was reported by Chief Administrator\n1 in her email.\n• Child A was in socks, there were remnants of snow on the\nground.\n• The case aide held Child A from the back, and she\nmomentarily placed Child A on the ground in a standing\nposition. Child A made a couple of steps as the case aide\nheld her from the back, after which time the case aide was\nable to get a grip and pick Child A up.\n• A male voice asking the case aide what was going on;\nand thereafter stating Child A does not have shoes on;\nChild A feet must be cold.\n• The case aide replied to the male voice that she was just\nwalking Child A a little bit.\nAnalysis The evidence is insufficient to support intentional or purposeful\nnegligence toward Child A, or a lack of effort to work with the child\nand the child’s family, and relevant individuals related to the case\nservice plan. The case aide briefly placed the child down while\nshe still had the child around the waist so that she could gain a\nbetter and firmer grip to pick the child up and carry her into the\nhouse.\nTechnical Assistance:\nIt is recommended that the agency follow through with the training\nplan Chief Administrator 1 reported pertaining to safe transporting\nof disabled children, the proper use of wheelchairs and staff\nensuring children are dressed appropriate for a transport. Proof of\ntraining shall be documented for the staff.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400. 12413 Medical and dental policy.\nSection (1) An agency’s medical and dental policy shall, at a minimum,\nDescription include all of the following:\n19",
    "(f) The provision of a dental examination and any treatment\nrequired for each child who is 4 years of age and older, including\nboth of the following:\n(i) A dental examination within 12 months before placement or a\nnew dental examination shall be completed not more than 90\ncalendar days after placement.\nViolation Additional Finding.\nType\nAllegation The agency was late in obtaining Child A’s initial dental\nexamination\nInvestigation During the review of Child A’s MISACWIS case record for this\ninvestigation it showed:\n• Per Child A’s 6/8/2022 date of placement, an initial dental\nexamination was due by 9/8/2022.\n• A June 2022 case contact that indicated the worker\nneeded to complete a sedation form for Child A to obtain a\ndental examination.\n• A 7/26/2022 case contact that indicated the caregiver was\nworking on getting Child A’s dental exam.\n• Child A’s dental exam was completed 11/14/2022, two\nmonths after the time period required by rule.\nAnalysis The agency did not in adhere to the rule.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\nIV.
