Complainant said Youth A reported to her this incident took\nplace sometime after Christmas 2022. Complainant said Youth A\nreported the staff was a “new staff”, in their 20’s or 30’s, with dark\nhair, was short and “bigger”, and was a “male acting like a\nfemale”.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the Children’s\nAssessment Center in Delta County on March 15, 2024. Youth\nA said she was previously placed at Vassar House and between\nDecember 31, 2022 and March of 2023 when no snow was on the\nground, but it was still cold outside, Staff 1 raped her. Youth A said\nshe and other youth from her unit were watching a movie in the\nmain building in the “movie room” and she needed to use the\nbathroom, so Staff 1 brought her to the bathroom and stood in\nhallway holding the bathroom door open. Youth A said there were\nfour stalls in the bathroom, and she was in the “last big stall”.\nYouth A said once she was finished using the bathroom Staff 1\nhad come into the bathroom and shut the door. Youth A described\nthe bathroom stall door as latching from both the inside and the\noutside and said Staff 1 unlatched the stall door and came into the\nbathroom stall with her. Youth A said she began to scream for the\nother staff that were working that day, unable to recall the names\nof the staff stating two were male and two were female, however\nno one responded to her scream. Youth A said Staff 1 took off her\npants, sock, shoes, then shirt, cornered her in the stall, put their\nhands on her stomach area and pulled her to the ground placing\n2",
