A voice mail message was left requesting a\nreturn phone call. Licensing Supervisor was interviewed via\ntelephone on December 12, 2023. Licensing Supervisor reported\nFoster Parent has been difficult to work with as she is slow to\nrespond to communication attempts and to submit licensing\ndocuments. Licensing Supervisor reported the agency has been\ndoing what they can in a timely manner to license Foster Parent,\nbut the process has been slow for the aforementioned reasons.\nStaff 1, the agency licensing worker, was interviewed via\ntelephone on November 13, 2023. Staff 1 reported the\nprospective foster parent, hereafter referred to as Foster Parent,\nattended an orientation on March 7, 2023, but the agency did not\nreceive a signed application from the Foster Parent until July 10,\n2023.
