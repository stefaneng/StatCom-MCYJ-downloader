    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period. One CAP submitted was in response to the 2023 renewal\ninspection completed on 10/9/2023 and the CAP was approved on 10/11/2023.\nThe agency was cited for 2 violations.\nA special investigation #2023C0000541 was initiated on 6/14/2023. The report\nwas completed on 7/11/2023, and the CAP was approved on 8/1/2023. The\nagency was in violation of rule 400.12409 Education policy. There was no repeat\nviolation of this rule.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) discussed barriers that impeded the agency last year.\nCA reported a supervisor was suddenly dismissed that resulted in another\nsupervisor having six staff members for a limited time period while hiring a new\nsupervisor.

The agency experienced\nunexpected case crises that involved workers having to report into the community\nto assist with crises situations and not completing their caseload requirements\nsuch as uploading reports, completing reports timely and other responsibilities.\nThe CA discussed a MiTEAM training that was a communication issue with the\nBSC Analyst that was required but the agency was not informed that it was a\nrequired training, so all of the agency staff missed this training. CA reported the\nagency is still struggling with the repeat violations from the last audit.
