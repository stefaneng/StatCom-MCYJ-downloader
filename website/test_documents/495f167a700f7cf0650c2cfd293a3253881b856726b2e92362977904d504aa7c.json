    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4144 Admission health screening; physical examinations.\n(2) An institution shall have the following documentation of\nan admission physical examination for each resident,\nunless an earlier examination is medically indicated:\n(b) For a resident 3 years of age or older, a physical\nexamination shall have been completed within 1 year prior\nto admission or a new physical examination shall be\ncompleted within 30 calendar days after admission.\nOne of three youth did not have a physical examination within\n30 days after admission. COVID-19 restrictions were not a\nbarrier during that time.\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan.\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional care, all\nof the following information shall be documented in the\ncase record within 14 days after discharge:\n(e) A statement that the discharge plan\nrecommendations, including medical and dental follow up\nthat is needed, have been reviewed with the resident and\nwith the parent and with the responsible case manager.\nFor one of eight discharged youth, there was no evidence that\nmedical information was reviewed with the resident,\nparent and/or responsible case manager. This is because the\ndischarge medical information was documented electronically\nand not written on the discharge form that is given to parents/\nguardians.\n4",
    "2.) The facility is in compliance will all ISEP requirements.\n3.) The facility is in compliance will all MDDHS Contract/Policies.\nIV. CONSULTATION\nI conducted unannounced visits at the facility and verified CAP compliance\nmonthly from November 2020 through March 2021. As of February 10, 2021,\ncompliance for all outstanding CAPs was verified. Details can be found on the CCI\nCompliance Monitoring spreadsheet.\nV. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility was placed on a First Provisional license on October 19, 2020 as a\nresult of special investigations 2020C0108055 and 2020C0108060 in which repeat\nviolations were established for Resident Restraint and Program Statement (staff\nfailing to follow Vista Maria’s policies and procedure).\nIn November 2020, the agency chose to voluntarily transfer all of the youth and\nstaff out of Donna Maria and Lourdes Halls and have not serviced youth under\nthis license since that time. If the agency decides to accept referrals on this\nlicense in the future, they have agreed to notify me beforehand and I will provide\nconsultation to address any changes in programming and/or the terms of the\nlicense.\nDuring this licensing period, the facility submitted three additional corrective\naction plans for the following licensing rule violations:\n R 400.4158 Discipline (verbal)\n R 400.4112 Staff qualifications\n R 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\n R 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan for the two violations listed in the\nbody, I recommend Vista Maria’s Specialty Residential be returned to a Regular license.\n5",
