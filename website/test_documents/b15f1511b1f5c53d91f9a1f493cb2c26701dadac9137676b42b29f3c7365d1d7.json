    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe facility has requested to change the terms of their license to their approved\ncapacity of 32 to be all used for co-ed secure short-term programing. The facility is\ncurrently approved for 24 beds to be co-ed secure short-term program and 8 beds\nto be male secure treatment program. The facility is requesting to close the terms\nof the 8 beds secure treatment program and use that capacity for the short-term\nprograming.\nIII. Methodology\n10/06/2022- Email from Chief Administrator asking how to be able to use the 8\ntreatment beds (pod A) for the short-term programing beds.\n10/06/2022- Application Received- Request to change the terms of the 8 secure\ntreatment beds (pod A) to be in included within the 24 secure short-term programing\nbeds.\n10/06/2022- Contact- Phone call- Consultant spoke with the Chief Administrator on\nthe phone about application request.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe Muskegon Juvenile Detention Center has been approved to have a capacity of\n32 youth across four different pods; Pod A1, Pod A2, Pod B1, and Pod B2. Pod A1\nwas approved to have a capacity of 8 males for a secure treatment programing.\nPod A2, Pod B1, and Pod B2 had the capacity of 24 co-ed youth for a secure short-\nterm programing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Muskegon Juvenile\nDetention Center began to see lower number in census especially within Pod A1. In\nMarch of 2021, the facility’s counselor for Pod A1 departed and the facility\ndischarged the last two youth in Pod A1. Since that time the facility has no\nplacement within Pod A1 and the rooms are not being used. Recently, the facility\nhas been maintaining a census of low 20’s within their secure short-term\nprograming and have been getting more request to place youth within that program.\nTo accommodate those needs, the facility wants to cease their treatment program\non Pod A1 and utilize it for secure coed short-term program. The layout of Pod A1\nis not different then the secure short-term pods and would be able to meet that\npopulations need. Pod A1 would be able to accommodate co-ed youth.\n2",
    "V. Recommendation\nI recommend for the terms of the Muskegon Juvenile Detention Center remain at\nan approved capacity of 32. I recommend for the terms of the license have all 32\nbeds be co-ed secure short-term programing.\n10/6/2022\n________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 6, 2022\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3"
