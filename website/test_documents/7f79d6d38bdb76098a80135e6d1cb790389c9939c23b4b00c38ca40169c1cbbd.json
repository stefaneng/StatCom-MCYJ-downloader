She told him to wait a minute because she was\nchanging. Another staff member was on shift and heard Youth A\ntell Staff 1 not to enter. Staff 1 opened the door anyway, stood in\nthe doorway, and stared at Youth A in a creepy way while she\ndressed. Staff 1 eventually exited the room and shut the door\nbehind him. Youth A did not immediately report the incident. She\nreported the incident on 11/08/2023. After the incident, Youth A\nfelt uncomfortable around Staff 1. He seemed to be following her\naround and hanging around her more often.\nInvestigation Complainant/Supervisor was interviewed via phone on\n11/14/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nbeing informed of the allegations by Staff 3 who was told by Youth\nA on 11/8/23. At that time, Complainant/Supervisor made a\nrecipient rights complaint and Recipient Rights began an\ninvestigation. Today (11/14/23) Complainant/Supervisor was\ninformed by Administrator 1 that the allegations would need to be\nreported to MDHHS because of the information learned during\ninterviews. Recipient Rights has not interviewed Staff 1 at this\ntime. She also reported on the day of the allegations being\nreported (11/8/23), Staff 1 was removed from working with youth\nat the facility. 11/7/23 was the last day Staff 1 worked at the facility\nbefore being suspended with a plan that Staff 1 will not be\nreturning to the facility. She reported informing Staff 1 of the\nallegations and the investigation by Recipient Rights and Staff 1\nreplied with “not surprised Youth A would embellish the report”.\nComplainant/Supervisor also reported being Staff 1’s direct\nsupervisor. Staff 1 has worked at the facility for the past month to\nmonth and a half. Staff have reported Staff 1 has been\ndisrespectful towards co-workers, engaging in nonhealthy\nrelationships with youth, ordering youth to do things rather than\nasking, and playing loud and disrespectful music during working\nhours.

Youth A went to Youth A’s bedroom to\nchange when Staff 1 knocked on Youth A’s door. Youth A\nreported to have yelled “hold on” and Staff 1 opened the door and\nstood staring for a minute at Youth A before slowly stepping out of\nthe room and closing the door. Youth A reported being in the\nprocess of changing clothing and having pants on. Youth A was in\nthe process of putting Youth A’s bra on and only needed to pull\nthe straps of the bra into place. Youth A was unable to recall if any\nprivate parts were showing but Youth A believed something could\nhave been showing. Youth A believed Staff 1 said “oops, I’m\nsorry” in a sarcastic manner. Youth A didn’t say anything to Staff 1\nat the time but later when coming across Staff 1 in the milieu,\nYouth A swore at Staff 1.

Staff 2\nalso reported Youth B had to yell at Staff 1 to shut the door the\nnext day after the incident with Youth A.

Staff 2 reported speaking to Staff 1 about\nensuring that he knocks on the door before opening it and she\n3",
    "was unable to recall Staff 1’s response. Staff 2 also reported not\ninforming anyone else of the incidents and was unable to identify\nwhy she didn’t take any action. Staff 2 admitted that she doesn’t\nknock on the door when doing room checks and was unsure if\nthere is a policy stating the need to knock each time.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 11/20/23\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported being told\nby Youth A on 11/9/23 Staff 1 was doing room checks and walked\ninto Youth A’s room when she was “naked”.

He reported Youth A told\nhim about the incident with Staff 1. Youth A told Staff 5, Staff 1\nwas standing in the doorway to Youth A’s room while doing a\nroom check and lingered there, making Youth A feel\nuncomfortable. Staff 5 reported he will knock on a youth’s room\ndoor and wait a couple of seconds before entering the room. If the\nyouth says wait a minute, Staff 5 will wait a couple more seconds\nand then tell the youth he needs to do the check. Staff 5 viewed\nStaff 1 as a good staff who was following the rules, but the youth\nin the program had no respect for because of his young age.\n4",

Staff 1 reported\nYouth A was wearing a “crop top tank top with straps and\nsweatpants”. Staff 1 believed the incident occurred before 4:30\npm. Staff 1 also reported since working at the facility, he has\nnoticed other staff not knocking on youth’s doors when doing room\nchecks and being told by staff (unable to identify) that knocking\ngives youth time to hide items in their room so you should not\nknock. Staff 1 was trained to knock on the youth’s door and the\nbathroom door when checking on a youth. When shadowing third\nshift staff, the staff don’t knock on the door before entering the\nroom. Staff 1 reported during his initial training he questioned why\nknocking was not in the manual but was unable to recall the\nresponse. Staff 1 also reported avoiding Youth A after the incident\nto give her space, however, Youth A was rude and often\ninterrupted Staff 1.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n11/29/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth B\nreported not being present during the incident. Youth B reported\nhaving knowledge of Staff 1 and described Staff 1 as giving off\n“weird vibes” because he would talk about his age and work\nexperience. Staff 1 told Youth B, his job was to supervise and\nwatch the youths’ behaviors. Staff 1 would also act childish\n(unable to give an example) and would play inappropriate music\nloud. When Staff 1 came into Youth B’s room for a room check,\nStaff 1 told Youth B he was coming into the room for a safety\ncheck and Youth B told Staff 1 to “get the fuck out of my room”.\nYouth B was asked about staff doing room checks and Youth B\nreported staff will knock when checking on a youth in the\nbathroom and staff (unable to identify specific staff) told Youth B\nthey do not have to knock when checking on youth in their rooms.\nYouth B also reported being told by Administrator 1 that staff don’t\nhave to knock when checking youth in a bedroom. Youth B then\nreported staff do knock on the bedroom door and ask if the youth\nis descent before opening the door to the room. Youth B feels safe\nat the facility.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n11/29/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth C\n5",
    "reported being down the hall in the kitchen when she heard Youth\nA scream. Youth C began to walk back towards her room (across\nthe hall from Youth A) when she observed Staff 1 standing in the\ndoorway of Youth A’s room holding the door open. Staff 1 was\nstaring and looking Youth A up and down while standing in the\ndoorway for about 15 to 30 seconds. Youth A was standing in the\nbedroom putting on a bra, but Youth C was unsure if Youth A was\nwearing pants or not. Youth C also reported about 15 seconds\nlater, Youth A came out of her room and down the hall yelling and\nscreaming while saying Staff 1 was a pervert. Youth A also said\nStaff 1 didn’t wait after Youth A told him to wait a second before\ncoming into the room. Youth A continued to talk about the incident\nthrough the evening and Staff 1 denied the allegations. Youth C\ndescribed Staff 1 as having limited experience in conducting room\nchecks and will linger in the room during the check. Staff 1 just\nwalks into the room and stands there while other staff just stick\ntheir heads in the door to make visible contact with the youth.\nYouth C reported being told by Staff 2 and Therapist that staff are\nto knock when doing room checks or checking on a youth in the\nbathroom. Youth C reported feeling safe at the facility.\nAdministrator 1 and Administrator 2 were interviewed face to\nface at the facility on 11/29/23 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. Administrator 1 reported training staff to knock before\nentering a youth’s room with the exception of 3rd shift. She also\nreported clarifying this training during their last team meeting. Staff\nare to knock for dignity and respect of the youth’s space and if the\nyouth tells staff to wait a minute, staff are to wait for the estimated\ntime it would take to put pants and a shirt on. Administrator 1 also\nreported staff are to measure the time it takes them to put on\nclothes then give the youth the same amount of time. The gender\nof staff doesn’t matter when doing room checks and no matter the\ngender, staff are to knock and if not hearing anything, they are to\nopen the door. Administrator 1 and Administrator 2 both reported\nthere is no written policy covering the process of doing room\nchecks.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nMichigan Department of Community Health Recipient Rights\nComplaint dated 11/10/23 and completed by Staff 3. This\ndocument outlines the incident as reported by Youth A.

    "changing. It is documented Youth A reported Staff 1 opened the\ndoor to Youth A’s room immediately and observed her “naked\nbody”. This document indicates Staff 1 would be removed from the\nworking schedule and not allowed to return to the facility until the\ninvestigation was completed. Other staff reported Staff 1 was\n“very harsh and talking down” to the youth in the program. Another\nissue identified is that Staff 1 attended the same high school the\nyouth attend last year before graduating in the spring. Staff 3 is\nreported to have been told, Staff 1 became upset when\ntransporting Youth C because he had forgotten Youth C’s\nmedication and had to return to the facility.\nPine Rest Interview Notes 11/13/23. This document has the\ninformation gathered from the recipient rights investigation at the\nfacility. The specific staff interviewed include, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff\n5, Supervisor, and Youth A. Each of these individual are\ndocumented as providing similar information as given during each\nof their interviews for this investigation. Additional information\nprovided included, Staff 3 documenting Staff 1 failure to knock on\nYouth A’s door when Staff 1 had attended a recent training on\nsafety checks. Staff 5 noted, Staff 1’s age and perceived lack of\nmaturity might pose challenges to the role of staff at the facility.\nPine Rest Christian Mental Health Services Maple South\nResident Safety & Supervision Policy dated 11/2023. This\ndocument was developed to provide a safe supportive, and\ntrauma informed environment for youth in care. The procedure for\nyouth safety checks is document and involve variable interval\nsafety checks at of minimum of every fifteen minutes. These\nchecks are to be completed more frequently if staff believe it is\nwarranted based on the youth’s behaviors.\nPine Rest Christian Mental Health Services Standard\nOperation Procedures: Maple South - Resident Safety checks\n08/2022. This document outlines the procedure for conducting\nsafety checks on youth. Each shift a specific staff is assigned the\nduty of conducting safety room checks. These checks are to be\ncompleted at a minimum of 15 minutes and in accordance with the\nclinical practices/behavior plans. Staff are to check for breath and\nbody when observing the youth. If the youth is in the bathroom,\nthen a staff of the same gender should knock on the door, indicate\nit is time for the safety check and place eyes on the youth. If the\nyouth is sleeping, then staff must make eye contact with body and\nmake sure they are safe. It is documented that if safety checks are\nhanded off to another staff the specific staff designed at the\nbeginning of the shift will inform the staff being passed the check\n7",
    "of the time of the last check. The staff taking on the checks will\nverify the time by checking the safety check sheet.\nHuman Resources file for Staff 1 was reviewed. Staff 1 was\nhired on 8/14/23 and completed orientation on 9/29/23.\nDocumentation indicates Staff 1 completed the “Procedure for\nResident Safety Checks” and his final clinical training on 9/29/23.\nStaff 1 completed his first “shadow Shift 1 (Self-Discipline)” on\n8/29/23 and his “Shadow Shift 2 (Respect)” on 9/8/23.\nDocumentation indicates Staff 1 completed “Shadow Shift 3\n(integrity) on 9/12/23 and “Assist Shift 1 (Achieve)” on 9/19/23.\nStaff 1 completed “Assist Shift 2 (Excellence)” on 9/16/23. There\nis a “corrective action notice” in the file dated 11/10/23. It is\ndocumented Staff 1 violated Group II rule 5: Staff members are\nrequired to engage in practices which promote safety to others.\nThis is the first offense. The offense involved Staff 1 documenting\na safety check at 1715 and not conducting another safety check\nuntil 1840 which is beyond the variable interval of at least every 15\nminutes. The corrective action involves Staff 1 reviewing the\n“Safety Checks Procedure”.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews and written documentation the agency is\nfound in compliance. Interviews were inconsistent on when or if\nstaff are to knock on youth’s doors or wait for a period of time prior\nto entering and there is no agency policy to provide clarification.\nStaff 1 knocked on the door and opened to Youth A in a state of\nundress. After several seconds he closed the door. There is no\nevidence that he acted inappropriate at that time.\nTechnical Assistance:\nIt was recommended that the facility develop a written policy and\nclarification of knocking on the door for a safety check. Because\nstaff and youth alike reported some staff knock and others do not.\nIt was recommended that the hiring process be updated to ensure\nstaff are of an appropriate maturity level to work with the youth\nserved.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n8",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n12/8/2023\n______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 15, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n9"
