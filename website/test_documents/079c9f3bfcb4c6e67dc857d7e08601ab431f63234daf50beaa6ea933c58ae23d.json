CA stated it was her impression all four youth\nwere initially placed with Placement 2, however it was requested\nthe three older youth be moved and they were placed with\nPlacement 1. Placement 1 was somewhat familiar with the\nchildren as they had stayed in the home under a safety plan prior\nto a petition being filed and their parents had done odd jobs at\ntheir house.

FC supervisor stated she received a\nnotification that a petition had been filed regarding Youth A, Youth\nB, Youth C and Youth D. Typically within a week there is a\ntransfer meeting where details of the case are discussed. She\nstated upon conducting the first visit with the children there were\nconcerns regarding Placement 1 and Placement 2 fictive kin\nrelationship. FC supervisor stated the information conveyed to\nfoster care staff by Placement 1 and Placement 2 was different\nthan the information conveyed to protective services staff. Based\non the information received, FC supervisor and FCW did not\nbelieve they met the definition of fictive kin as Placement 1 has\nreported they had not met any of the youth prior to them being\nplaced in their home. FC supervisor stated at the time of\nplacement she and FCW were told the placements were\ntemporary and the placement unit was actively looking for other\nplacement options. FC supervisor stated a TDM was held and the\nconcerns regarding placements were discussed including the\nissue the court had not ordered the fictive kin placement. She\nstated the court brought up placement at the adjourned\n2",

The referee then verbally\nordered the youth to be moved to appropriate placements.\nFollowing the hearing, prior to an order being issued, the county\noffice appealed the order to move all of the youth. FC supervisor\nstated the appeal was granted and the court approved the fictive\nkin placements.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via Teams on\nMarch 29, 2023. FCW stated at the time the foster care case\nopened she was told that Youth A, Youth B, Youth C and Youth D\nwere in placements with “sort of fictive kin”. It was reported to\nFCW that the initial placements were temporary, and the\nplacement unit was working to identify a long-term placement.\nFCW stated she attended the adjourned preliminary hearing and\nwas asked by the referee about the current placement. When\nFCW explained the placement was with fictive kin the referee\nbecame upset and explained the court had not granted approval\nfor the fictive kin placement.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n 6/14/2022-9/8/2022 CPS closing USP. Closing\nrecommendations state the children were placed in fictive\nkin placements.\n Change of placement TDM held on 7/12/2022 to discuss\nfictive kin placement that has not been approved by the\ncourt and the families do not fit the definition of fictive kin.\nRecommended the children remain in current placements\nuntil other placements are located.\n 7/11/2022 fictive kin safety screen.

None of the children had a\nrelationship nor knew of placement prior to CPS placing\nthem there.

    "summary": "The Wayne County DHHS placed four children in fictive kin homes without required court approval, violating placement rules. The court discovered the unauthorized placements during a hearing, leading to an initial order to remove the children, which the agency appealed and later obtained retroactive approval. The agency's failure to secure prior court authorization and its internal miscommunication regarding the placements' legitimacy constituted a clear violation of procedure, with primary culpability lying with the agency for not following proper approval protocols.",
