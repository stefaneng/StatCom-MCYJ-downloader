    "II. ALLEGATION\nViolation\nEstablished?\nFacility has not submitted records to MDHHS for permanent Yes\nretention one year following the final order of adoption as required.\nThere are 2 records that have not been submitted.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n05/23/2022 Special Investigation Intake\n2022C0212016\n05/24/2022 Special Investigation Initiated - Telephone\nTelephone call to Chief Administrator\n06/01/2022 Inspection Completed On-site\nMet with Chief Administrator\n06/01/2022 Contact - Face to Face\nInterviews with Chief Administrator, program manager and\nbusiness manager.\n06/09/2022 Contact - Document Received\nEmail with Chief Administrator\n06/11/2022 Contact - Document Received\nEmail with Chief Administrator\n06/17/2022 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\n06/22/2022 Contact Pre-exit with Chief Administrator\nALLEGATION:\nFacility has not submitted records to MDHHS for permanent retention one year\nfollowing the final order of adoption as required. There are 2 records that have not\nbeen submitted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/23/22 it was reported to DCWL that DHHS had not received two closed\nadoption files that were due in 2021. Contact occurred with the complainant to\ndetermine the names on the overdue files.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nOn 5/23/22 CA was contacted and notified of the investigation. On 6/1/22 an on-site\ninspection was completed, and CA was interviewed with supportive information\nprovided by the Foster Care Supervisor and Business Manager. CA reported\ndifficulty with taking files to local DHHS offices during the pandemic, as no one was\navailable at the offices to receive the files.\nCA provided the agency policy/procedure regarding sending adoption/foster care\nfiles to DHHS. Currently a monthly report is generated and identifies which files will\n2",
    "be due in the next few months. Staff then gather files and prepare them to be sent\nby the due date. CA reported this has been their “unofficial” procedure for some\ntime, but COVID had interfered with this process. The process is now outlined in a\npolicy/procedure, which will be reviewed with staff.\nCA provided the following information for the identified files:\n File one: Due to DHHS December 2021. Sent to DHHS 4/19/22.\n File two: Due to DHHS December 2021. Sent to DHHS 4/19/22.\nIn addition to these two files, a review of closed adoption files determined there are\ncurrently four adoption files from 2020-2022 that are overdue and need to be sent to\nDHHS. There were also fifty-four files from that time period that were submitted to\nDHHS late. The agency is in the process of packaging overdue files to submit to the\nlocal DHHS offices.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nADM 1030 Disposition of Records for MDHHS- Supervised Children\nFor both MDHHS and contracted adoption agency cases, the\nlocal MDHHS office or contracted agency must retain all\nadoption case records for one year after finalization of the\nadoption. One year (between 12-13 months) past the adoption\nfinalization date, a contracted adoption agency must send the\noriginal record to the local MDHHS office; copies must not be\nmaintained by the contracted adoption agency; see licensing\nrule R400.12713-Adoption Placement Record.\nANALYSIS: A violation was found due to multiple adoption files that were\nlate or remain overdue to DHHS.\nTechnical Assistance\nIt was discussed with the CA there was some confusion about\nfile retention dates and inclusion of the foster care file, when\nsending the adoption file to DHHS. Technical Assistance was\nprovided regarding FOM 722-15 as it conflicts with Rule 422(4)\nregarding file retention. DCWL confirmed that FOM 722-15 must\nbe followed.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",

RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\n_______________June 23, 2022_____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 28, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
