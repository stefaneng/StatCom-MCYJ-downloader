    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112 Staff qualifications\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nDescription following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Unidentified staff are \"mean\" and mistreat Youth X.\nInvestigation I attempted to reach Complainant/Hospital Social Worker 1 via\nphone and left a message with her dayshift counterpart conveying\nthat I was assigned to investigate the allegation.\nI notified Youth X’s Foster Care Worker that I was the assigned\nDCWL investigator. She indicated Youth X was in the emergency\nroom at Children’s Hospital and she had no concerns regarding\nChrist Child House.\nI spoke with Chief Administrator (CA) on 4/12/23. She was\nalready aware of the allegation. CA said Christ Child House\nsubmitted a 30-day request to DHHS to remove Youth X from their\nprogram and he was slated to be removed on 4/14/23. Youth X is\ncognitively impaired and went AWOL from the facility on 4/11/23.\nWhen police found him, he refused to return to Christ Child. The\npolice bought him fast food, took him to Christ Child to eat it, and\nYouth X still refused to stay at the facility. Police then transported\nhim to the hospital.\nInitially Children’s Hospital denied Youth A's admission as he was\nineligible for hospitalization and had just been discharged two\nhours earlier for throwing rocks at moving vehicles in traffic and\nother erratic behavior. However, his second time there, he told\nhospital staff he felt unsafe at Christ Child House and refused to\nreturn. The hospital held Youth X and reported suspected\nabuse/neglect to the appropriate government agency due to his\nreport of feeling unsafe and refusal to return to his placement.\nThe government agency who received the report is not\ninvestigating and transferred the complaint to DCWL.\nI interviewed Youth X in Children’s Hospital Emergency Room (T-\n10) on 4/12/23. He was watching television and Christ Child Staff\n1 was supervising him. I introduced myself and he agreed to talk\nto me. Youth X presented with a blank stare and severe stuttering.\n2",
    "I asked how the staff at Christ Child are mean. After a long\npause, he said “I ask them to stop restraining me, but they keep\ndoing it. The kids keep calling me ‘B’s’ and stuff.” I asked how\nthe staff at Christ Child mistreat him. Youth X responded, “By\nrestraining me…a lot. That’s why I left.”\nSpecifically, Youth X said Supervisor 3 and 4 restrained him and\nthen “let go” as he was trying to leave the facility (AWOL) on\n4/11/23. He could not remember the reason he wanted to leave.\nAsked if he likes the staff at Christ Child, Youth X said he likes\nStaff 1 and 2 but dislikes all the rest. He also dislikes the other\nyouth. Youth X denied that any staff ever caused him any harm.\nI interviewed Residential Director (RD) on 4/12/23. She has\nworked at the facility for five years. Before Youth X went AWOL,\nshe said Supervisor 3 and 4 attempted to escort him to his room.\nYouth X dropped his weight, announced he was leaving and\nwalked out the door. There are no records indicating Youth X has\never been physically restrained.\nI asked RD if she was aware that kids call Youth X “B’s.” She\nacknowledged that he and another youth did get into a verbal\nconflict before he went AWOL on 4/11/23.\nI reviewed Supervisor 3 and 4’s employee files.\nPast disciplinary actions for Supervisor 3 include:\n• 9/23/21 - Verbal warning for violating medication\ndispensing policy\n• 7/8/21 - 10-day suspension for pushing a youth\n• 6/11/20 - 2-day suspension for threatening a youth and\nunapproved physical management technique\n• 5/23/19 - Verbal warning for unapproved physical\nmanagement technique\n• 7/26/18 – Verbal warning for unapproved physical\nmanagement technique\nPast disciplinary action for Supervisor 4 includes:\n• 3/18/21 – 5-day suspension for pushing a youth and\nunapproved physical intervention\nAnalysis There is no evidence that Supervisor 3 or 4 mistreated or caused\nphysical harm to Youth X.\nHowever, it is concerning that both reported they “escorted” the\nyouth when video shows they clearly restrained him. Moreover,\n3",
    "the restraint was unnecessary. (See additional finding below).\nFor these reasons, there is evidence that Supervisors 3 and 4\nrequire specific retraining on what constitutes a “restraint” and the\nconditions in which restraint can be used. Thus, currently both\nSupervisors are unable to perform their assigned duties as\nleaders of the direct care staff.\nConclusion Violation Established\nADDITIONAL FINDING:\nRule Code & R 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription\n(4) Only the least restrictive intervention necessary to prevent\nimmediate harm to the youth or others may be used and must\nfollow an individualized set of graduated interventions that avoid\nthe use of restraints.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth X was physically restrained for refusing to go to his room.\nInvestigation Video of dining room on 4/11/23 at 6:55pm\nCA and I viewed one minute of video of Supervisor 3 and 4’s\nreported “escort” of Youth X just prior to his AWOL on 4/11/23. It\nshows the youth sitting alone at a dining room table. Supervisors\n3 and 4 approach him on either side. Supervisor 4 extends his\nhand to the youth, but Youth X stands and pivots away. Both\nSupervisors take each of his arms and begin walking him away\nfrom the table, momentarily using a supportive hold. Youth X\nimmediately pulls away and is unwilling to walk. Rather than\nrelease him, Supervisors tighten their hold using physical force to\nrestrict his movement. Youth X hops up onto a nearby table and\nkicks at staff using the table for leverage. Supervisor 3 initiates a\none-man small child hold (aka basket hold) while Supervisor 4\ncontinues to hold the youth’s left arm. Youth X is jumping,\nstruggling with his arms, and shifting his weight against the staff’s.\nMovement out of the dining room continues at increments until\nthey reach the threshold of the room. The video ends there and\nvideo from the next room was unavailable.\n4",
    "I interviewed Supervisor 3 with CA present on 4/27/23. He has\nworked at the facility for 15 years and was last trained in physical\nmanagement on 6/26/22. Supervisor 3 said he and Supervisor 4\nwere trying to “get Youth X to go to his room.” Youth X was on\n“restriction” for destruction of property after damaging facility\nvehicles. Supervisor 3 said youth on “restriction” receive\nrecreation, group meals and are allowed to play board games.\nHowever, they are not permitted to play video games or watch\ntelevision. After dinner with the group, Supervisor 3 said Youth X\nrefused to go to his room and remained non-verbal after multiple\nattempts to persuade him. Finally, he said he and Supervisor 4\n“attempted to transport him.” “We were on his sides trying to start\nan escort. He struggled…He became aggressive. We kept\nholding about a minute. Youth X never got loose. We got to the\nsink. He dropped to the floor. I had his arm. I think Supervisor 4\nlet him go. It wasn’t textbook. Youth X kept saying ‘I want to\nleave.’ We helped him to his feet. He walked with us. There was\nno struggle. We opened the exit door to the building because he\nsaid he wanted to leave. We let go and he walked out the door\nand gate (off the property). Supervisor 3 insisted “We never\nrestrained him” and he denied Youth X was physically injured\nafterward.\nI interviewed Supervisor 4 with CA present. He has worked at the\nfacility for 3.5 years and was last trained in physical management\non 6/27/22. Earlier in the day, Supervisor 4 said the boys were\nacting out, so he decided to separate them into two groups “to\nstop the chaos” – one group upstairs to their rooms and the other\ndownstairs. “I told Youth X he had to go upstairs. I sat 20\nminutes talking to him asking him to go. He wouldn’t. Supervisor\n3 kept asking. Youth X said ‘No, I want to go home.’ After\nmultiple attempts to get him to comply, Supervisor 4 said he and\nSupervisor 3 positioned themselves on either side of the youth.\n“He jumped up…It was a bit of a struggle. Before the sink, it was\nstill a struggle. Youth X dropped to the floor by the door saying he\nwanted to go home. Supervisor 3 held his arm. I rubbed his\n(other) arm. We got him up by his arms and escorted him to the\nfront (exit). We opened the door, and he walked out the building\nand gate. I called 911.”\nPublic Act 116 defines “personal restraint” as the application of\nphysical force without the use of a device for the purpose of\nrestraining the free movement of a minor child’s body. It does not\ninclude (ii) Briefly holding a minor child without undue force in\norder to calm or comfort him or her or (iii) Holding a minor child’s\n5",
    "hand, wrist, shoulder, or arm to safely escort him or her from one\narea to another.\nAnalysis Video shows Youth X sitting quietly at the dining room table\nrefusing staff directives to move to his room. His behavior was\nnoncompliant but not harmful to himself or others. After multiple\nfailed verbal attempts to gain compliance, Supervisors 3 and 4\nstarted to escort Youth X to his room. When the youth physically\nresisted, Supervisors did not release him. At that point, what may\nhave started as an “escort” developed into an unjustified “physical\nrestraint.” Supervisors 3 and 4 utilized the two-man control hold\nand Supervisor 3 used the single-person small child hold. This\nrestraint could have been avoided as Youth X was not physically\naggressive until Supervisors used force to restrain his free\nmovement.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nI recommend CA or RD review all video of “escorts” by staff\nimmediately to verify the youth was truly escorted and not\nrestrained. All restraints must be documented as such and\nreported to the appropriate parties in a timely manner.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is submitted, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nMay 1, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n05/02/2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
