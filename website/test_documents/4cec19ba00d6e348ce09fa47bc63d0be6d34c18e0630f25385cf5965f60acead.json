The duration of the restraint is very brief.\nIncident Report: An agency incident report dated February 23, 2022, and written by\nStaff 1, was reviewed. The incident report does not add additional information except\nthat Youth A was threatening him and there was concern that Youth A would obtain\nitems she could hurt herself with.\nMISACWIS Incident Review: A review of incident reports involving Youth A\nindicates that she has not been assaultive or engaged in self harm while in the\nprogram. The February 23, 2022, incident is the only one documented in the system.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(4) The written policy shall only permit the licensee to\nrestrain a child for the following circumstances:\n(a) To prevent injury to the child, self-injury, or injury to\nothers.\n(b) As a precaution against escape or truancy.\n(c) When there is serious destruction of property that\nplaces a child or others at serious threat of violence or\ninjury if no intervention occurs.\n4",

Staff 2\nreported that she did not hear Youth A making threats to others.\nStaff 3 reported that she felt the restraint was unjustified as\nYouth A was not engaging in harm to self or others. Staff 3 did\nnot hear Youth A making threats to Staff 1 or others.\nYouth A reported that she was not making threats to Staff 1 or\nothers.\nYouth B did not hear Youth A making threats or being\nassaultive.\nThe video recording does not establish that Youth A was being\nassaultive, engaging in self harm, or destroying property, any of\nwhich would necessitate a restraint.\nThe restraint was unjustified.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended, based on the findings of Special Investigation 2022C0128019\nthe license be modified to a first provisional license.\nMarch 17, 2022\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 21, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
