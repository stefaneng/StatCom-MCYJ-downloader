    "ALLEGATION#1:\nOn August 7, 2020, Resident A’s finger was broken when Resident B physically\nattacked him. Resident A’s foster care worker was never notified about the incident until\nAugust 12, 2020. To date, Mott Children’s Residence has not provided any safety plan\nor documentation stating how Resident A and Resident B will be separated moving\nforward. It is unclear where staff was during this incident as well.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed MDHHS Foster Care Worker 1 via telephone on August 20, 2020. She\nstated on August 7, 2020 Resident A had legos inside of a blanket that belonged to\nanother peer. A different peer took the blanket from Resident A making the legos scatter\neverywhere. Resident A got upset and cussed while cleaning up his legos. Resident A\nwas then threatened by a peer who attacked him once support staff exited the unit.\nResident A was punched in the face several times and kicked. He was immediately\ntaken to the medical staff, where he received an icepack for his hand. Foster Care\nWorker 1 reported on August 11, 2020, Resident A stated he wanted to press charges\non the peer, due to being bullied and due to the peer breaking his finger. She stated\nshe was never notified about the incident on August 7, 2020, which resulted in Resident\nA’s finger being broken, until the email was sent on August 12, 2020 stating Resident A\nwanted to press charges. She said she was just informed that Resident A will be moving\nto another Whaley Children’s Center residential facility so Resident A will be separated\nfrom the peer that attacked him.\nI interviewed Resident A face-to-face on-site on August 26, 2020. Resident A said he\nwas on Vemco unit sitting on the bench with legos that were inside a blanket. Resident\nB tried to grab the blanket and when he did the legos fell on the floor. He said Resident\nB then started hitting him and staff (he could not recall the staff's name) pulled Resident\nB off of him. He said he does not know why Resident B started hitting him. He said he\nwent to the hospital because his finger was hurting. They gave him an ice pack and\nthen he had to go to another place on a different day to get x-rays. He said that the\nhospital said his finger was not broken. He said after he left the hospital, the hospital\nsaid that his finger was broken and he got a cast on his finger. He said that his finger\nfeels better now and that it is healing.\nI interviewed Mott Children's Residence Staff 1 face-to-face on-site on August 26, 2020.\nStaff 1 reported Resident A had been antagonizing the other resident. He had been\nredirected to stop. Resident A had legos inside a blanket and he was sitting on the\nbench inside the unit because they were getting ready to leave the unit. Resident B\ngrabbed the blanket and the legos fell on the floor. Resident A started cursing. While\nshe was helping Resident A pick up the legos off of the floor, Resident B started hitting\nResident A. She stated she immediately pulled Resident B away. Staff 1 reported staff f\nkept Resident A and Resident B away from each other for the rest of the night. She\nreported Resident A was placed at another Whaley Children’s Center house after the\nincident.\n3",
    "I interviewed Mott Children's Residence Staff 3 face-to-face on-site on August 26, 2020.\nStaff 3 said Resident A was taken to the hospital on August 7, 2020 and Mott Children’s\nResidence was told Resident A’s finger was not broken. Resident A had x-rays taken\nlater that day. She stated the hospital called Mott Children’s Residence on August 10,\n2020 and indicated that Resident A’s finger was fractured. Mott Children’s Residence\nStaff 6 emailed DCWL Consultant 1 regarding the injury. She stated the hospital faxed\nmedical documentation to Mott Children’s Residence on August 11, 2020. Mott\nChildren’s Residence emailed MDHHS Foster Care Worker 1 on August 11, 2020 once\nthey were informed of the finger fracture.\nI reviewed medical documents on August 26, 2020. The nursing notes documented the\nfollowing:\n August 7, 2020 at 3:31 p.m. – Resident A was seen by nurse for finger and taken\nto Mott Children’s Hospital. There were no abnormal findings. The range of\nmotion (ROM) was within normal limits but Resident A is having pain in area. Ice\napplied and Motrin given. The doctor ordered x-rays just to be sure there was no\nfracture in the area. Resident A’s nose was bleeding, ice applied to that area as\nwell. Bleeding stopped after 15 mins.\n August 10, 2020 - Staff took Resident A to Michigan Ortho where they applied a\nfinger splint to his left hand for broken ring finger. Resident A must wear it for 7-\n10 days and has an appointment on August 21, 2020.\n August 11, 2020 - A message was left for the nurse from Hurley Hospital\nindicating that Resident A’s finger was fractured and he needed to be followed up\nby Michigan Ortho.\n August 25, 2020-Resident A went to get splint removed at Michigan Ortho. Splint\nwas removed and a manual splint with medical tape and fracture is healing well.\nKeep two fingers taped together until next appointment on September 11, 2020.\nI reviewed an email dated August 10, 2020 at 3:32 p.m. sent by Staff 6 to DCWL\nConsultant 1. The email stated Resident A’s finger was broken in an altercation with a\npeer. This occurred on August 7, 2020. He was taken to Hurley ER for x-ray’s on\nAugust 7, 2020 and they were informed it was not broken. However, they received a\ncall on August 10, 2020 from Resident A’s pediatrician’s office indicating that it was\nbroken. Resident A was at Ortho Michigan for further treatment.\nI reviewed an email dated August 11, 2020 from Mott Children’s Residence to MDHHS\nFoster Care Worker 1. Resident A’s medical paperwork from Hurley Hospital was sent\nto MDHHS Foster Care Worker 1. The medical document stated Resident A was\nexamined on August 7, 2020 for pain. He was diagnosed with a nondisplaced fracture\ninvolving distal portion of proximal phalanx of left fourth finger with intra-articular\nextension within proximal interphalangeal joint. There was minimal soft tissue swelling.\nOn August 26, 2020, I reviewed an incident report dated August 7, 2020 and completed\nby Staff 1. The incident report stated Resident A had ben redirected earlier in the shift to\nstop antagonizing peers and he stopped. After breakfast, Resident A and his peers sat\n4",
    "on the readiness bench while waiting to go to the family game room. Resident A had\nlegos inside a blanket belonging to another peer. A different peer snatched the blanket\nfrom Resident A, making the legos fall on the floor. Resident A became upset and\ncursed while cleaning his legos up and was threatened by a peer, who then attacked\nhim once support staff had exited the unit. Resident A was punched in the face several\ntimes as well as kicked. Resident A was immediately taken to medical staff where he\nreceived an icepack for his hand.\nI interviewed Mott Children's Residence Staff 5 via telephone on August 27, 2020. Staff\n5 stated she was not on the unit when the altercation between Resident A and Resident\nB occurred. She reported she had only seen the legos on the floor. She said she was on\na 1:1 with another youth. That youth had breakfast and staff wanted him to shower but\nhe wanted to call his mother first. He started to walk off the unit so she followed him.\nStaff 5 stated when returned to the unit, less than five minutes later, Resident A and\nResident B were calm. She reported Resident A and Resident B were separated for the\nrest of the day and night.\nI interviewed Mott Children's Residence Staff 3 via telephone on September 17, 2020.\nStaff 3 reported a message was left for Resident A’s father on August 12, 2020\nregarding the injury to Resident A’s finger. She stated Resident A’s father did not return\nthe phone call.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to show that Mott Children’s\nResidence failed to provide appropriate supervision for Resident\nA and an appropriate safety plan following the incident between\nResident A and Resident B. Staff 1 was present during the\nincident and immediately separated Resident A and Resident B\nwhen Resident B began hitting Resident A. Resident A and\nResident B were kept separate for the remainder of the day and\nnight. Resident A was moved to Optimist House after the\nincident occurred as part of the safety plan.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4150 Incident reporting.\n(1) Any incident resulting in serious injury of a resident or\nillness requiring inpatient hospitalization, shall be reported\nto the parent/ legal guardian, responsible referring agency,\nand the licensing authority as soon as possible, but not\nmore than 24 hours after the incident.\nANALYSIS: There is sufficient evidence to show that Mott Children’s\nResidence did not notify Resident A’s parents not more than 24\nhours after they were informed by Hurley Hospital that Resident\nA’s finger was fractured. Hurley Hospital called Mott Children’s\nResidence on August 10, 2020 and a message was left for\nResident A’s father on August 12, 2020.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION#2:\nOn August 12, 2020, Resident A had something under his arm in which was a female\npeer's underwear he had taken from a cubby. He explained he took them so he could\nput them on in the shower because it made him feel like he was having kids with the\nfemale peer. It was unknown how Resident A had access to this female peer's cubby\nand where supervision was during the time, he was able to take the underwear.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed MDHHS Foster Care Worker 1 via telephone on August 20, 2020. She\nreported on August 18, 2020 she was notified on August 12, 2020 that Mott Children’s\nResidence staff noted Resident A had something under his arm in which was a female\npeer's underwear he had taken from a cubby. He explained he took them so he could\nput them on in the shower because it made him feel like he was having kids with the\nfemale peer. MDHHS Foster Care Worker 1 stated she does not know how Resident A\nhad access to this female peer's cubby and she does not know where staff was during\nthe time, he was able to take the underwear.\nI interviewed Resident A face-to-face on-site on August 26, 2020. Resident A denied\ntaking anything belonging to his peers, including underwear from another resident's\ncubby which is located by the readiness bench.\nI interviewed Mott Children's Residence Staff 2 face-to-face on-site on August 26, 2020.\nStaff 2 said the residents were on the unit sitting on the bench as they just came inside\nthe unit. She reported the female resident had clothes in her cubby that she must have\nforgotten to put away. She said sometimes the female resident likes to put her clothes in\nthe cubby when she gets ready for her shower. Resident A asked Staff 2 if she could let\n6",
    "him into his room because he needed to put his shoes up. She said Resident A had his\narm down and she saw something under his arm. She asked him what it was and he\nsaid he did not have anything. Staff 2 reported Mott Children’s Residence Staff 4 came\nonto the unit and Resident A lifted up his arm and the female resident’s underwear fell\non the floor. She stated Staff 4 talked to Resident A about the incident. Staff 2 stated\nthat the female peer is no longer allowed to keep any clothes in the cubby.\nI interviewed Mott Children's Residence Staff 4 face-to-face on-site on August 26, 2020.\nStaff 4 stated when he walked onto the unit, Resident A had something tucked under\nhis arm. Staff 4 asked Resident A to show him what was under his arm. Resident A\nlifted his arm and the underwear fell to the floor. He reported that he then discussed the\nincident with Resident A. Staff 4 thinks Resident A took the underwear whenever he\nwas sitting on the readiness bench and the female resident had clothes in her cubby,\nwhich is located right above the bench. Staff 4 reported that the female peer is no\nlonger allowed to keep any clothes in the cubby.\nOn August 26, 2020, I reviewed an incident report dated August 12, 2020 and\ncompleted by Staff 2. The incident report stated Resident A was sitting on the bench\nwaiting to get moved in. Resident A then asked her if she could open his room so that\nhe could grab something. As staff was walking to Resident A’s room, she noticed\nResident A put something under his arm to hide it. When she stopped Resident A to\nask him what it was, Resident A refused to show her. When Resident A finally agreed\nto show staff, he revealed he had a pair of underwear taken from his female peer’s\ncubby. When staff asked Resident A why he took them, he explained that he wanted to\nput them on in the shower because it made him feel like he was having kids with a\nfemale peer on the unit.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to show that Mott Children’s\nResidence failed to provide appropriate supervision for Resident\nA. Mott Children’s Residence is a co-ed facility. The female\npeer’s cubby, which Resident A had access to, is located on the\nunit in a public area. It is possible that while Resident A was\nsitting on the bench, which is located directly underneath the\ncubbies, he took the female peer’s underwear unbeknownst to\nthe staff. The staff reported that the female peer is no longer\npermitted to keep clothes in her cubby.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend no change in the\nlicense status.\nOctober 12, 2020\n________________________________________\nAlicia Wiggins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 13, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n8"
