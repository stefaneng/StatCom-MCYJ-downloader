    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth A went AWOL on 8/24/2022, and the facility failed to notify Youth A’s parent.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 9/20/2022 I spoke with the Complainant X by telephone. Complainant X\nreported Youth A had been in independent living placement with the Community\nCare Organization (CCO) agency; and he apparently went AWOL from his\nplacement in. Complainant X said Youth A’s mother, Parent B contacted her on\n9/9/2022; and Youth A called her on 9/19/2022. Parent B asked her why no one had\ncontacted her about Youth A’s AWOL. Parent B reported getting a call from Youth A\nearlier that he was out of state. Parent B did not say exactly when it was that Youth\nA had called her or where Youth A was located. Youth A affirmed to Complainant X\nhe had left his placement. He reported wanting to enroll in school and Parent B had\nsuggested he call Complainant X. Complainant X surmised Parent B and Youth A\nreached out to her because she had investigated a matter related to Youth A back in\nApril of this year. Complainant X is not Youth A’s DHHS (Department of Health and\nHuman Services) worker or monitor.\nOn 9/30/2022 during an onsite CCO agency visit, I interviewed Administrator 2 and\nCase Worker 3. Administrator 2 reported they did not contact a parent related to\nYouth A’s AWOL.\n• Administrator 2 reported she did not contact Youth A’s mother related to his\nAWOL because she did not have contact information for Parent B. She\nreported Parent B was not involved in Youth A’s case at court. Additionally,\nthat Parent B’s contact information was not indicated in MISACWIS.\nAdministrator 2 reported Case Worker 4 gave approval for Youth A to have a\nweekend pass on 8/19/2022 with his brother unbeknownst to her. Youth A\nwas to return 8/21/2022; and on 8/22/2022, he was technically AWOL\nbecause he did not return to the facility by 9:00pm. Administrator 2 reported\ndiscovering after the fact that Youth A had apparently planned not to return to\nthe independently living home/he AWOLed because he had taken all of his\nbelongings. She reported that after Youth A’s AWOL, Case Worker 4 was\nputting forth efforts needed to conduct a search for Youth A. Administrator 2\nreported contacting the DHHS monitor on 8/23/2022 and provided me an\nemail showing such. She reported after a call from Parent B on 9/9/2022 they\nwere leaving messages at the number Parent B called from but received no\nresponse back. Administrator 2 suspected that Youth A was with Parent B\nbecause August 24th is Parent B’s birthday. On 9/19/2022 the agency\nreceived a contact from children services that Parent B had called to say\nYouth A called her and reported that he was AWOLed. Parent B had also\nreported that no one contacted her. Administrator 2 reported that on\n9/20/2022 Parent B contacted the agency, reportedly from a different number,\nreporting she was Youth A’s mother, not the grandmother; as she had\npreviously alleged.\n3",
    "It is notable, the number Administrator 2 reported Parent B called them from,\nand that they contacted Parent B at after 9/9/2022 is the same number listed\nas the contact number for Parent B in MISACWIS. It is also the number I left\nmessages for Parent B at and from which Parent B contacted me from.\n• Case Worker 3 reported she was on medical leave from 7/5/2022 until\n9/9/2022. She reported that Case Worker 4 was responsible for Youth A’s\ncase during her leave time, and when Youth A AWOLed at the end of August.\nCase Worker 3 reported receiving a call from Parent B on 9/9/2022, but at\nthat time Parent B presented herself as Youth A’s grandmother. Case\nWorker 3 reported the agency tried to hold Youth A’s bed/placement after he\nAWOLed. Administrator 2 was trying to work that out with Youth A’s DHHS\nmonitor.\nOn 10/3/2022 I interviewed Parent B by telephone. Parent B denied receiving a\ncontact from the agency related to Youth A’s August 2022 AWOL. She also denied\ncontacting the agency pretending to be Youth A’s grandmother or anyone other than\nherself. She further denied Youth A being with her on her birthday. Not that she\nknew he had AWOLed at that time. She reported receiving the first call from Youth A\non 9/3/2022 when he asked her to come pick him up from Indiana. Youth A reported\ngetting to Indiana by way of a bus pass from the agency, which the Case Worker 3\ndenied would be something the agency would provide to a youth. Parent B reported\npicking Youth A up on 9/4/2022, but not reporting that to the agency. She reported\nafter Youth A was with her on 9/4/2022 she was contacting the agency. Youth A was\npicked up by someone as she trying to report his whereabouts; Youth A had left.\nReviewed\nYouth A’s case record which showed:\n• He is a temporary court ward.\n• He was placed with the agency from 4/8/2022 until 8/22/2022. He resided at\nthe agency’s Joanna Street independent living house in Detroit.\n• Different action summaries completed related to Youth A’s termination from\nthe program.\n• Bed hold payment request form beginning 8/22/2022-9/18/2022.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\n722-03 A Absence Without Legal Permission (AWOL)\nWithin 24 hours\nWithin 24 hours of the child’s absence, the supervising agency\nmust notify:\n• The parents, if appropriate.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency did not notify Youth A’s parent he had AWOLed and\nwas missing from placement.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date November 10, 2022\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 21, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
