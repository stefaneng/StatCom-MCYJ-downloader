Staff did not provide youth a blanket and coat when\nthey asked. Staff directed youth to the door when they stated they\ndid not want to be at the facility. Youth A went AWOL and was\nbrought back by law enforcement. Staff are disrespectful towards\nthis youth.\nInvestigation This complaint was received on 05/10/2024 and assigned for joint\ninvestigation with MDHHS Specialist.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Youth A at the agency on 05/10/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist. Youth A is 14 years old and\nhas been at the agency for almost two months. Youth A admitted\nshe AWOLed twice on 05/09/2024. She first AWOL’d from school,\nwent to the library, and afterwards went to the police station. The\npolice dropped her off at the agency. The second time she\nAWOL’d, was because she asked Staff 2 to give her a blanket and\ncoat, but Staff 2 was rude. Youth A told Staff 2,” I don’t want to be\nhere.” Staff 2 told Youth A, “I can’t stop you, so there’s the door,\ntoodles.” Youth A got up, grabbed her coat, blanket, and walked\nout of the agency. Youth A went to the police station and stayed at\nthe police station for two hours before the police drove her back to\nthe agency. Youth A said there was another incident when Staff 2\nhad searched her backpack and found she had obtained a work\npermit, Staff 2 started laughing. Staff 2 told her, “You think you are\ngoing to get a job?” and laughed. Youth A could not provide the\nspecific date or if there were any witnesses to this incident. Youth\nA repeated several times she does not want to be at the agency\nbecause the way the staff talk to the youth.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the agency on 05/10/2024, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 1 is the clinical coordinator and was\n2",
    "not present on the day in question. She said Youth A had AWOL’d\ntwice on 05/09/2024. The first time Youth A AWOL’d from school\nand the second time was from the agency. Staff 1 said the agency\nis an open treatment program and staff will not prevent a youth\nfrom leaving, but they do encourage the youths not to leave. Staff\n1 was informed Youth A told Staff 2 she was leaving, and Staff 2\ntold her she cannot stop her if she wants to leave. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A is very defiant and refuses to follow the rules. Youth A\nhas refused to go to school, participate in therapy, and take her\nmedication consistently. Staff 1 provided a copy of the incident\nreport.

FCW did not say\nshe had any concerns for the staff.\nI interviewed Supervisor at the agency on 05/13/2024, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist. Supervisor has been\nworking at the agency for 5 years. Supervisor reported on\n05/09/2024 law enforcement dropped Youth A off after she\nAWOLed from school. Supervisor said Youth A was agitated and\ndefiant. When the police were leaving, they told Youth A to have a\ngood night and she replied, “I can’t make any promises.”\nSupervisor was in the office and Youth A was sitting in the hallway\noutside her office with Staff 2. Youth A asked for her coat and\nblanket and Supervisor told her they were getting ready to go\nupstairs. Youth A became mad and said, “I don’t know why I came\nback”. Supervisor told Youth A she has to follow the rules. Youth\nA got up, grabbed her coat and blanket and walked out.\nSupervisor denied hearing Staff 2 tell Youth A “there’s the door” or\n“toodles.” Supervisor said Youth A’s coat and blanket were in her\ncubby. She said Staff 2 did say we can’t stop you if you want to\nleave. Supervisor contacted the police and filed a police report.\nYouth A was dropped off by the police two hours later. She said\nYouth A has been behaving and following the rules since the\nincident on 05/09/2024. Supervisor denied having any concerns\nfor Staff 2 and the way Staff 2 spoke with Youth A.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the agency on 05/13/2024, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 2 is a Youth Specialist and has been\nworking at the agency for one year. Staff 2 reported Youth A was\n3",
    "agitated on 05/9/2024, after law enforcement dropped her off.\nStaff 2 said Youth A asked for her coat and blanket and she and\nSupervisor told Youth A she would be going upstairs to bed, and\nYouth A became irritated. She said Youth A got up, grabbed her\ncoat from the cubby, and walked out. She denied telling Youth A\n“there’s the door” or “toodles.” Staff 2 said she did tell Youth A she\ncannot stop her if she AWOL’s. Staff 2 said she has previously\ntalked to Youth A about how dangerous it is to AWOL and\nencourages her to make better decisions. Staff 2 denied being\ndisrespectful to Youth A or any other youth. Staff 2 said there was\none incident where Youth A had a map in her bag, but there was\nno incident where she had a work permit. Staff 2 said she has\nnever laughed or made a comment about Youth A getting a job.\nI interviewed Youth B at the agency on 05/13/2024, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist. Youth B has been at the\nagency for one year. Youth B reported some of the staff are rude\nand disrespectful and don’t try to stop them when youth AWOL.\nYouth B admitted to AWOLing, and staff have told her “We can’t\nstop you.” Youth B initially would not say who the staff member\nwas, but then she identified Staff 2 as a staff member who is rude\nand uses profanity with the youths. Youth B said she didn’t want to\ngive specific examples or dates, because staff are probably\nwatching and listening to the interview. Youth B was interviewed in\nthe living room and there is a camera, but no audio.\nI interviewed Youth C at the agency on 07/16/2024. Youth C has\nbeen at the agency for two years. Youth C denied staff are rude or\ndisrespectful. Youth C admitted she has AWOLed in the past but\ncould not recall the date. Youth C has heard staff say, “there’s the\ndoor”, when she and other youths threaten to AWOL. Youth C\nreported all her needs are being met and expressed no concerns\nregarding the staff or the agency.\nVideo reviewed:\nVideo footage of 05/09/2024 in the hallway area outside\nSupervisor’s office was reviewed on 05/16/2024. (Note: video has\nno audio) Youth A was sitting in a chair in the hallway, Youth A\nstood up, grabbed her coat and left. Staff 2 walked over to\nSupervisor’s office and points to the outside door.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident report dated 05/09/2024 was consistent with\nSupervisor interview.\n• Agency AWOL Procedures: Staff must always be aware of\neach client’s whereabouts. Client is considered AWOL for\n4",
    "situations that include running away, skipping school, and\nunapproved outings. They must be reported as missing\nimmediately when their whereabouts are unknown. Staff\nmust notify law enforcement, relative caregivers/parents,\nproviders, and DHHS Staff.\n• Staff 2’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record.\n• Email from Foster Care Supervisor 05/30/2024, stated a\npackage was sent to Youth A, and the agency would not\nallow Youth A to have the package because she was on\nrestrictions.\n• Facility’s Professional Conduct Policy states the facility is\ncommitted to a work environment in which all individuals\nare treated with respect and dignity. The policy further\nstates employees should be respectful, courteous, and\nmindful of others.\n• Facility’s Behavior Management Policy states appropriate\nmethods of behavior management include but are not\nlimited to time-outs, loss of privileges, chores, redirection\nand behavioral contracts. Behavioral management methods\nshould always be appropriate to the age of the child.\nAnalysis Based on interviews there is insufficient evidence to support the\nallegations that staff directed youth to the door when Youth A\nthreaten to AWOL and that staff are being disrespectful. Per\nagency AWOL policy, when a youth AWOLs staff do not stop\nthem.\nCONSULTATION:\nGirlstown staff should refrain from using sarcastic remarks when\nyouths threaten to AWOL. Instead, Staff should discourage the\nyouths negative behavior by using positive words to redirect them.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Program Statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation On 5/4/24, staff took youth to be drug screened without a court\norder.\n5",
    "Investigation Youth A reported all youth were drug screened last week,\nbecause staff found a vape in one of the lockers. Youth A reported\nstaff search all youth when they come back from school or being\nin the community. She denied using drugs or a vape.\nSupervisor reported per agency handbook they can drug screen\nthe youths if they suspect drug or alcohol use. All the youths are\nprovided with a handbook at admission, and they sign a receipt\nindicating they received the handbook. She reported Youth C, who\nis no longer at the agency was found to have a vape pen and\nmarijuana cartridges. Youth C was also known to put things in\nYouth A’s locker, so that is why all the youths were drug screened.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Girlstown Handbook receipt signed by Youth A dated\n03/15/2024.\n• Girlstown Handbook states the if the agency suspects drug\nor alcohol use, they will require youth to complete a drug\nscreen and failure to complete a drug screen will be\nconsidered a positive screening.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance per staff interviews and\ndocumentation provided as their program statement allows for\nyouth to be drug screened if the agency suspects drug or alcohol\nuse.\nCONSULTATION:\nIt is recommended the agency create and follow policies that align\nwith the requirements for MDHHS policy and contracts,\nspecifically addressing drug screens.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
