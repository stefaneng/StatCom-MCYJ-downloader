Staff are overworked and mandated to work\novertime without breaks.\nOn Pods A & B, there is often one staff supervising 17 – 20 youth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDCWL received this anonymous complaint on 8/25/20 transferred from another\ngovernment department.\nI interviewed Staff 1 by phone on 8/25/20. She stated there are only three regular\nafternoon staff working at the facility. Staff from other shifts are randomly selected and\nmandated to cover the vacant shifts. “We are mandated about once a week and hardly\never get breaks…Our breaks are less than 15 minutes.” Staff 1 said Lincoln Center\nstruggles to keep staff because of frequently mandated overtime. “Staff are overworked\nand not allowed to go outdoors for fresh air. I’ve complained about it.” Staff 1 added\nthat one staff she knows had to “work two pods at a time.” She did not know when this\nhappened or how many residents that staff person was monitoring. “We’re supposed to\nhave two staff on each pod, but there may just be one. One staff will have more than 10\nresidents. This only happens to the male staff.” Again, Staff 1 could not provide a date\nor time that the male staff she referred to monitored more than 10 residents. She\nprovided me his name and I attempted to contact him. He did not return my calls.\n3",
    "Licensing rules do not regulate staff breaks and do not prohibit facilities from mandating\novertime.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone on 8/25/20. She said she is mandated to work one to\nthree hours overtime “almost every day.” The shortage of staff has become worse since\nthe COVID pandemic. More than six months ago, she said she was asked to monitor\nmore than 10 residents during waking hours. Staff 2 did not remember the date this\nhappened.\nI interviewed Staff 3 by phone on 8/26/20. For the past year, he said “security” staff\nhave been being pulled to the floor to work as direct care staff. “We are thrown onto the\npods every morning to make their ratio. We are not trained as youth specialists…I\ninformed HR of it.” Staff 3 said several security staff recently resigned because they\nwere tired of being “pulled to the floor.” “There are supposed to be one supervisor and\nfour security guards in the building. Now there is one supervisor and one security guard\non each shift.”\nRule 400.4127 (2) Staff to resident ratio indicates: At a minimum, 1 direct care worker\nshall be responsible for not more than 10 residents at 1 time during residents’ normal\nawake hours and nor more than 20 residents at 1 time during the residents’ normal\nsleeping hours.\nI interviewed CA 1. She indicated the agency’s staff to resident ratio is 2:10 during\nwaking hours (which translates to 1:5) and 1:10 during sleeping hours. Supervisor 1\nindicated the ratio is 1:9 during waking hours and 1:10 during sleeping hours. CA 1 and\nSupervisor 1’s responses were inconsistent.\nI requested the agency’s written ratio policy/program statement. It indicates the\nfollowing:\n1. “The ratio of direct care workers to residents during normal, non-school\nwaking hours, shall be no less than one worker to ten residents (2:10).\n2. The normal staffing pattern will be two workers to eleven residents (2:10).\n3. During normal sleeping hours, the ratio shall be one worker to eleven\nresidents (1:10). All Staff members are awake during this period.”\nCA1 l indicated by email that CMO youth are supervised at a ratio of 1:9 and SOM JJ\nyouth require a ratio of 1:5. She said CMO and state-contracted youth are mixed\ntogether on the same pods. Lincoln Center’s written policy does not indicate that ratios\ndiffer by contract.\nCA1 provided staffing records for the last two weeks of August 2020 for Pods A & B.\nThe records indicate there was one staff assigned to monitor 6 – 9 youth on each pod\non both day and afternoon shifts from 8/17/20 through 8/31/20. The facility staffed Pods\nA & B at a ratio of 1:9 while the JJ contract requires a ratio of 1:5. The facility is within\n4",
    "the minimal licensing requirement of 1:10 but is out of compliance with the JJ\ncontractual requirement.\nCA1 indicated there are currently 10 full-time security vacancies and 20 full-time direct\ncare vacancies. 14 contingent security staff and 27 contingent youth workers are\ncovering these shifts. CA1 said she is diligently interviewing approximately 20\ncandidates per week to fill these positions.\nI reviewed the job description for security workers. Their normal responsibilities are as\nfollows:\n Controls facility entrances, visiting areas, and staff equipment issued by the\nagency. Confiscates contraband from staff, visitors and residents that can be\nfashioned into a weapon or used to aid in an escape.\n Operates the agency control centers (audio visual surveillance; door locking\nand alarm systems, fire systems, panels for locks and in an efficient manner\nattentive manner.\n Patrols assigned areas with attention to security, fire safety, and safety of all\npersonnel.\n Responds to all emergency situations.\n Patrols outside perimeter of facility paying special attention to fences, parking\nlots, facility entrances and windows.\n Screens visitors and issue visitor’s passes.\n Prepares written reports concerning incidences of youth disturbances or\ninjuries.\n Maintains authority and structured supervision in all situations including\ntransportation.\n Follows mandatory seat belt laws and ensures that youth are shackled as\nindicated in the Standard Operations Procedures Manual.\n Takes direct transportation routes and informs facility if detours must occur.\nObserves conduct and behavior of youths and communicates unusual\nbehavior to direct service staff and management to prevent disturbances and\nescapes.\n Uses appropriate care and safety when operating vehicles and handling\nequipment.\n5",
    " Completes vehicle safety and inspection forms each time a Spectrum\nJuvenile Justice van is driven.\n Complies with SJJS and Spectrum program manuals and procedures\n Completes institution staff and youth headcounts at scheduled times\n Reports Youth Workers and/or Security Officers that vacate their assigned\nwork assignments or that fall asleep on duty.\n Pays attention to and reports evidence of forbidden activities, and emergency\nsituations.\n Answers facility telephones in an appropriate and courteous manner.\n Inspects locks, windows, grills, doors and gates for tampering.\n Searches youths and cells for contraband articles and weapons.\n Escorts youth within the facility and grounds.\n Attends and actively participates in all training, in-services, conferences and\nmeetings as required by SJJS.\n Maintains a clean professional appearance\n Does not vacate assigned post until properly relieved. Must accept mandatory\novertime.\n Performs other duties as assigned by program supervisory and executive\nstaff.\nPrior to employment security workers sign an agreement that says Spectrum Juvenile\nJustice Services reserves the right to revise or change their job duties as the need\narises. CA 1 said youth workers and security workers receive the same training and\nthat both are qualified to supervise groups of children per the licensing rule.\nI reviewed training records for three randomly selected security staff. All three staff had\nthe sufficient number of training hours and annual training in Crisis Intervention - Handle\nWith Care indicating the training for security staff aligns with the training requirements\nfor direct care staff.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Youth workers and security staff are often mandated to work\novertime. However, there was no specific evidence that this\ncreates a safety risk to the youth. According to agency training\nrecords and job descriptions, security workers can be pulled to\nwork on the pods and are qualified to directly supervise groups\nof children.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: The agency’s staff-resident ratio policy is confusing and\nunclear. The written words in the policy do not match the\nnumerical ratios listed. For example, during school, the\nwords say the ratio is 1:10 but the numbers say 2:10.\nDuring “normal” staffing patterns (presumably non-school\ndays), the words say 2:11 but the numbers say 2:10.\nDuring sleeping hours, the words say 1:11 but the\nnumbers say 1:10. The words do not match the\nnumbers. The existing policy must be revised to clearly\nreflect current practice and the contractual requirements\nof the youth.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "JJ Contract Non-Compliance Established\nAccording to Lincoln Center, the ratios of staff to resident differ by contract. Lincoln\nCenter does not separate differently contracted youth by pods. Therefore, any pod that\nhouses at least one JJ youth needs to function at the contracted ratio of 1:5. Pods A\nand B house a mixture of SOM JJ and COM youth. Daily from 8/17/20 – 8/31/20, one\nstaff supervised more than 5 youth on days and afternoons shifts on Pods A and B.\nDuring those times, the facility was not within the JJ contracted staffing ratio.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nSeptember 30, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 30, 2020\n_______________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n8"
