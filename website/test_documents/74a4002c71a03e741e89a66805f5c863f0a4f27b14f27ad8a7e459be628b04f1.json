He\nstated that he and Staff 1 attempted to verbally de-escalate Youth\nA.

She stated that she had a session with Youth A later in\nthe morning on the day of the incident. Youth A did not mention\nanything about being in pain, about what potentially occurred, or\nanything about an alleged incident involving Staff 1.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• A safety plan dated 11/15/2023 was provided. This stated\nthat Staff 1 was not to work alone with Youth A and was\nalways to be at least arm’s length away from Youth A when\nin his presence.\n• No discipline was noted in Staff 1’s personnel file at the\nbeginning of the investigation. Recent discipline was\nprovided dated 12/12/2023 where it was confirmed that\nStaff 1’s employment was terminated because of the\nincident in question and the “inappropriate child handling\ntechnique with a client in care.”\n4",
    "• An incident report dated 11/16/2023 regarding the\n11/15/2023 incident was reviewed. It was described that\nYouth A broke line of sight of staff when he was supposed\nto be in school on the morning of 11/15/2023. He\neventually got into the staff break room where Staff 1 met\nhim. At that point Youth A was attempting to break the time\nclock off of the wall. Staff 1 asked Youth A to stop, and\nwhen he did not Staff 1 used what was described as a\n“breaking up a fight” restraint hold by placing his hands on\nYouth A’s waist. It further described that Youth A charged\nat Staff 1 and tried to pick him up by the legs. Staff 2 then\nstated to Youth A to let Staff 1 go, and then Youth A walked\nout of the room.\n• Written statements by several individuals involved in the\nincident were reviewed, all dated 11/15/2023.\n• Staff 1’s written statement is consistent with the\ninterview that he provided. It noted that Youth A did\nnot listen to his request to stop attempting to break\nthe time clock, that Staff 1 attempted to move Youth\nA by the waist and then Youth A charged at Staff 1,\nonly for Staff 2 to ask him to stop and then Youth A\nleft the room.\n• Staff 2’s written statement is consistent with the\ninterview that he provided. In it he stated that he\nwitnessed Staff 1 attempting to get in between the\ntime clock and Youth A, only for Youth A to grab\nStaff 1. Staff 2 told Youth A to let go of Staff 1 and\nYouth A left the room.\n• Staff 3’s written statement is consistent with his\ninterview. Staff 3 stated that he did not see the\nbeginning of the incident and entered the room to\nsee Youth A and Staff 1 holding each other, with\nYouth A then quickly leaving the room.\n• Youth A’s written statement is consistent with his\ninterview. Youth A described that Staff 1 grabbed\nhim by the neck and stated, “Get your bitch ass out\nof here.” Youth A stated that he pushed Staff 1 only\nfor Staff 1 to grab Youth A near his neck and push\nYouth A against the wall.\n• Facility policy titled “Behavior Support and Management\nPolicy'' dated 05/09/2023 was provided and reviewed. This\npolicy outlined the facilities chosen restraint model,\nCPI. This described the approved techniques for physical\nintervention with youth and none of the approved and\ntrained holds were described in interviews and\ndocumentation provided.\n5",
    "Video Review:\n• Video footage on 11/15/2023 was reviewed. This footage\ncame from a camera that is near the front entrance to the\nbuilding. This camera points toward that door from the\ninside, and also looks into the staff break room at a slight\nangle. A full view of that break room is not available. At\n9:09am Staff 2 attempted to open the door to the staff\nbreak room only for someone to open it from the inside. At\nthis point Staff 1 grabbed Youth A from the corner of the\nroom where the time clock is located and pulled him away\nfrom that corner. At 9:09am Staff 1 was seen pushing\nsomeone away from him. At 9:09 Staff 1 pushed Youth A\nbackwards towards the corner of the room. At this point\nStaff 2 was inside the room. The door then closed from the\ninside as Staff 3 approached it. Staff 3 opened the door\nand Staff 1 could be seen in the corner of the room only\nbriefly where he had pushed Youth A. At 9:10am Staff 1\nwas seen moving in and out of view and he appeared to be\nin a physical struggle with Youth A. Staff 3 then entered\nthe room and the door closed behind him, obstructing the\nview of the camera. At 9:10am the door opened again from\nthe inside and Youth A then walked out with Staff 3\nfollowing.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff, and review of\ndocumentation and video there was sufficient evidence found that\nthere was a rule violation related to the physical incident between\nStaff 1 and Youth A. Staff 1 was observed to push Youth A.\nAdditionally, Staff 1 and Staff 2’s account of the incident is not\nconsistent in what is seen via video.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility is advised to locate and have fixed every door in\nthe building that is intended to be locked but may be\nbroken. The door that Youth A used that allowed him\naccess to a staff only area was broken and should not have\nallowed him access.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2023C0000295 dated 01/18/2023, CAP approved 02/16/2023\nSIR 2023C0000074 dated 01/18/2023; CAP approved 04/14/2023\nSIR 2023C0000496 dated 08/08/2023, CAP approved 08/15/2023\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n12/22/2023\n__________________________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong\nLicensing Consultant Date\nApproved By:\nJanuary 3, 2024\n__________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel\nArea Manager Date\n7"
