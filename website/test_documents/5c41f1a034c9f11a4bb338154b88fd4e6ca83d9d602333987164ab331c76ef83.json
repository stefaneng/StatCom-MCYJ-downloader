INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 yelled at, cursed and verbally attacked Youth R, Youth K,\nYouth O, Youth M and Youth P.\nInvestigation DCWL received this investigation on 4/24/24.\nI collaborated with the Placement Coordination Unit, Foster Care\nWorkers for Youth R, Youth K, Youth O, Youth M and Youth P\nwere notified that I was assigned to investigate the allegations and\nno workers expressed additional licensing concerns.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Youth M on 4/26/24 with Rights Officer present.\nShe described Staff 1 as “a loud person” who expresses herself in\na “different” way. Youth M denied Staff 1 has ever been verbally\nabusive to her or other youths. She could not recall Staff 1\nswearing or saying anything inappropriate.\nI interviewed Youth R on 4/26/24 with Rights Officer present. She\ndescribed Staff 1 as “mean, loud, picks with us and yells about our\nchores.” Youth R said Staff 1 made a general statement that if a\nyouth “puts hands on her she would put hands on them, but lots of\nstaff probably say that when they are mad.” Youth R recalled one\nspecific instance in March 2024 when Staff 1 used abusive\nlanguage and made an offensive comment related to her trauma.\n2",
    "Youth R later retracted that Staff 1 made this remark. (See Rule\n112 below).\nI interviewed Youth K on 4/26/24 with Rights Officer present. She\nappeared angry, was short and resisted the interview. Youth K\ndescribed Staff 1 as a “bitch” who has cussed at her. She was\ntired of discussing the matter and remarked, “I don’t care about\nthis anymore.” Youth K said Staff 1 told her she stunk but she\nrefused to elaborate. She walked out of the interview yelling,\n“Yes. I said I’m safe. I’m safe. I’m safe.” Rights Officer reported\nthis matter was already addressed internally with Staff 1.\nOn 4/26/24 I interviewed Youth O with Rights Officer present.\nShe was angry and said I was “wasting her time for no reason.”\nYouth O said Staff 1 referred to her as a “half breed,” that Youth O\nwas “pissed off” about it and Former Youth H heard her say it.\nYouth O had no other opinions about Staff 1. She said she and\nStaff 1 have not reconciled or talked about the alleged name-\ncalling. Rights Officer reported this was matter was already\naddressed in a Special Plan for Safety and Adjustment dated\n4/8/24.\nI interviewed Youth P at Havenwyck Hospital on 5/2/24. She\ndescribed Staff 1 as “very disrespectful and always yells and\ncusses.”\nI interviewed Former Youth H on 4/29/24 via phone. She\nexplained she was in the kitchen when Youth O was cussing and\ncalling people the “N” word regardless of their race. “Staff 1 told\nYouth O, ‘You shouldn’t say that word because you’re half-breed.”\nFormer Youth H also reported when she was at the facility that\nStaff 1 told her she (Former Youth H) was “fat and needed to lose\nweight.”\nI interviewed Supervisor with Rights Officer present. She has\nworked at the facility for 19 years and supervises Staff 1.\nSupervisor denied ever hearing Staff 1 yell at, cuss or verbally\nattack any of the youth. Conversely Supervisor said Midnight\nTeam Leader remarked in front of her, Youth P and others that\nStaff 1 was “triggering Youth P.” “I removed Midnight Team\nLeader, had her step away from Staff 1 and told Midnight Team\nLeader she should not say those things in front of youth.”\nSupervisor said Midnight Team Leader and Staff 1 have\ncomplained about each other to her and she encouraged Midnight\nTeam Leader to talk to her own supervisor on midnight shift.\n3",
    "On 4/26/24 I interviewed Staff 1 with Rights Officer present. She\nhas worked at the facility for nine months. Staff 1 denied using\nabusive language and making an insensitive remark to Youth R\nrelated to her trauma. “That didn’t happen. I don’t know about\nYouth R’s situation (trauma)” she insisted.\nStaff 1 denied telling Youth K she stinks, adding that this alleged\nincident was already addressed internally by Rights Officer. Staff\n1 stated, “Whatever Youth K told Midnight Team Leader is not\ntrue.” She went on to explain that she used to work the midnight\nshift with Midnight Team Leader. “I found Midnight Team Leader\nunprofessional so in mid-February 2024 I moved to dayshift.”\nStaff 1 was asked if she called Youth O a “mixed breed mutt” and\ndescribed her interaction with the youth. Staff 1 said “I redirected\nYouth O not to say the “N” word and asked her to step out of the\nkitchen. The next day I heard I told her she was a mixed breed,”\nwhich she denied saying. Staff 1 confirmed a written plan was\ndevised so she would not be alone with Youth O in order to\nprotect her (Staff 1) from further allegations.\nStaff 1 denied she verbally attacked Youth M and Youth P on\n4/24/24. Instead, she said she redirected the girls with Supervisor\npresent. Moreover, Staff 1 said Midnight Team Leader stepped in\nand said Staff 1 was “triggering Youth P” in front of Supervisor,\nYouth P and other youths. Staff 1 felt it was inappropriate for\nMidnight Team Leader to undermine her in front of the youths.\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed a Special Plan for Safety and Adjustment dated 4/8/24.\nThe plan indicated Youth O and Staff 1 will not engage in\nconversations that are not about meeting Youth O’s needs at the\ncurrent moment and Staff 1 is only able to be on Youth O’s wing\nwith another staff member.\nI reviewed an email to Rights Officer by the author of the Safety\nPlan indicating its purpose was/is to promote comfort to Youth O\nand Staff 1 and prevent further allegations against Staff 1.\nAnalysis Rights Officer and Vista Maria’s team had already looked into\nmost of these matters, intervened and addressed them with Staff\n1 prior to this investigation commencing. Despite the facility’s\ninternal processes being underway, Midnight Team Leader still\nbrought them to the attention of Children’s Protective Services and\nDCWL.\n4",
    "The licensing rule prohibits verbal abuse, derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language, negative references to a youth’s\nbackground, appearance or mental state as well as yelling,\nthreats, ridicule, and humiliation.\nWhile it is difficult to prove that certain words were uttered, three\nyouths stated Staff 1 yells and/or cusses, two reported she made\na negative reference to Youth O’s racial background and two\nothers said she made negative references to youths’ physical\nappearance/body odor.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care, safety,\nand supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth P was on one-to-one supervision and left alone for 40\nminutes.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth P could not be interviewed immediately as she was at the\nhospital awaiting a psychiatric evaluation. On 4/26/24 Rights\nOfficer indicated there was a plan to transfer her to Havenwyck\nHospital.\nI interviewed Youth P on 5/2/24 at the psychiatric hospital. She\nsaid on the morning of 4/24/24 she was on 1:1 staff supervision\nfor self-harm and was left alone for what she estimated was two\nhours.\nSupervisor said on 4/24/24 at 7am Staff 2 was Youth P’s\nassigned 1:1 staff. When she walked into the building, Youth P\nwas sitting alone in the living area and Staff 2 was in the hallway\nabout 12 feet away. “I told Staff 2 she needed to be ‘on the young\nlady’ meaning arms distance away. Supervisor said Midnight\nTeam Leader was still in charge in the building and should have\nbeen the person to correct Staff 2.\n5",
    "I interviewed Staff 2 with Rights Officer on 5/1/24. She has\nworked at the facility for six months and has 11 years of\nexperience working in child caring institutions. At 7am on 4/24/24\nStaff 2 said Midnight Team Leader was in charge at Myriam Hall.\nThere were two youths on 1:1 and “Midnight Team Leader got to\nscreaming at me and Staff 1 that no one was Youth P’s 1:1. I went\nto Youth P and stayed with her the rest of the day.” Asked who\nand how 1:1’s are assigned, she said direct care staff “assign\neach other and work it out amongst each other.”\nI interviewed Midnight Team Leader with Rights Officer via video\nconference on 5/3/24. She said she went to Myriam Hall at 7am\non 4/24/24 to assist staff. When she arrived, there was no other\nDayshift Team Leader or Supervisor in the building because the\nassigned Team Leader was running late. After passing morning\nmedications, Midnight Team Leader said she noticed Youth P\nsitting alone at 7:30am, which she considered child neglect as she\nrequired 1:1 supervision for self-harm. Midnight Team Leader\nsaid she was not aware there were two 1:1’s that morning. I\nasked Midnight Team Leader if she assigned herself or any of the\ndirect care staff to monitor Youth P on 1:1. She said she was\nunable to be the youth’s assigned 1:1 staff but “subliminally\nbecame her 1:1.” Midnight Team Leader struggled and could not\nexplain what she meant by “subliminally.”\nVideo:\nFootage on 4/24/24 showed Youth P exit her room at 7:18am and\nwalk around the unit alone until Staff 2 paired with her at 7:41am.\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed Vista Maria’s Client Observation Policy which indicates\nfor youth on 1:1 supervision, staff will remain with the youth at all\ntimes and must never leave the client without replacement staff\navailable to provide uninterrupted observation.\nI reviewed Youth P’s Observation Checklist dated 4/24/24 which\nindicated Youth P was on 1:1 status for self-harm and Staff 2\ndocumented her activities at 7:15am, 7:30am, 7:45am and\nbeyond.\nAnalysis Youth P was on 1:1 supervision for self-harm. Video showed\nYouth P did not have a staff person by her side for 23 minutes.\nMidnight Team Leader, staff and Youth P indicated after exiting\nher room in the morning, Youth P did not receive 1:1 staff\nsupervision for a relatively short period of time.\nCONSULTATION\n6",
    "Supervisors/Team Leaders should identify staffing needs at the\nbeginning of each shift based on youth acuity. Supervisors/Team\nLeaders should assign specific staff to specific youths requiring\n1:1 supervision, clearly communicate this to the staff and\ndocument the assignments. If staffing gaps exist, I recommend\nSupervisors/Team Leaders/Case Managers/Unit Managers fill the\ngaps temporarily until direct care staff relief arrives.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff qualifications\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Midnight Team Leader told Youth R to lie about Staff 1 when she\nwas interviewed.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Youth R again on 4/29/24 with Rights Officer via\nvideo conference. She admitted that before her interview on\n4/26/24, Midnight Team Leader came to her room and told her to\nlie when she was asked about Staff 1. Specifically, Midnight\nTeam Leader told her to say that Staff 1 had remarked, “That’s\nwhy you fucked your brother” and if she did not say this, Midnight\nTeam Leader would lie to everyone about Youth R.\nMidnight Team Leader admitted she did talk to Youth R alone in\nher room but denied she coached her on what to say about Staff\n1. Instead, she only confirmed with Youth R that she reported the\nstory correctly to Children’s Protective Services as Youth R had\npreviously told her. Asked why Youth R would say Midnight Team\nLeader coached her, she assumed Staff 1 had said it.\nMidnight Team Leader believes issues began between her and\nStaff 1 after she reported Staff 1 internally for using abusive\nlanguage. “Staff 1 is disrespectful to me, yet I still do my job.” I\nasked Midnight Team Leader if she undermined Staff 1 by\ncorrecting her in front of the youths. She did not recall doing that\nand said she tries to support staff. Midnight Team Leader\nbelieves she can continue working with Staff 1 without further\ndisputes.\n7",
    "I asked Midnight Team Leader what Vista Maria can do to assure\nthere are no gaps in staffing particularly for those youths requiring\n1:1 supervision. She responded, “Maybe a pay raise.”\nAt the end of the interview Midnight Team Leader referred to Vista\nMaria as “a hostile environment for staff and youth.” She clarified\n“It’s more staff verbally abusing each other than staff verbally\nabusing kids.” I asked if Midnight Team Leader trusted that Vista\nMaria’s management team and administrators would or could\nsolve these internal issues. She responded, “No.”\nAnalysis Midnight Team Leader has an idealistic view of what it takes to\noperate a large child caring institution. She does not seem to\nunderstand the myriad of factors affecting how staffing patterns\ncan change on an hourly basis and does not trust Vista Maria’s\nleadership to address and follow through on her complaints.\nDespite the facility’s internal processes being underway, Midnight\nTeam Leader brought the matters to the attention of Children’s\nProtective Services and DCWL seemingly due to vindictiveness\ntoward Staff 1.\nMidnight Team Leader’s personal issues and lack of trust in her\nemployer and others negatively impacts her ability to perform the\nduties of her assigned position.\nCONSULTATION\nI recommend Midnight Team Leader and Staff 1 not work together\nin any capacity and that any complaints one has about the other\nbe handled internally by the facility.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2024C0000866SI intake 10/25/23, CAP approved 12/14/23\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n8",
