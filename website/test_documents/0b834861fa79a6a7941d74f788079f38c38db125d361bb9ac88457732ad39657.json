INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to Resident Ratio\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the\nDescription direct supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable\ninterval, eye-on checks of residents. The time between the\nvariable interval checks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff did not provide supervision; therefore, two youth were able to\nengage in sexual activity.\nInvestigation I spoke to Administrator 1 on 10/30/23. Allegations were\ndiscussed. Administrator 1 reported the video revealed there was\n1",
    "a lack of supervision. Administrator 1 reported that Youth A and\nYouth B were in the bedroom together and were able to sexually\ntouch each other.\nI watched the video dated October 22, 2023. Youth A and Youth B\nwere in the same bedroom from 8:39pm to 10:54pm. Staff 1 was\nin the staff office in the unit and did not visibly check on the youth\nduring this time frame. Youth came out of the room at 10:54pm.\nInterviews\nYouth A and Youth B:\nBoth interviews were conducted on 11/3/23 face to face that the\nfacility. Youth A reported that she distracted Staff 1 while Youth B\nwent into her room. Youth B confirmed this in her interview. Youth\nreported they had sexual contact. Sexual contact was defined by\nboth Youth A and Youth B as kissing, rubbing each other’s breast\nand behind, as well as toughing each other’s vaginal area. Both\nYouth A and Youth B reported it was consensual.\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on 11/13/23. Staff 1\nreported that she was working on the unit on 1/0/22/23. Staff 1\nreported that she had never worked with this unit before and did\nnot know the program or the youth that were in the program. Staff\n1 reported she has been with the agency for three months. Staff1\nreported that she did not complete eye on checks at intervals\nthroughout the night and did not think that she had to. Staff 1\nreported she thought this was like the other unit she has been\nworking in at the agency.\nStaff 2:\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on 11/13/23. Staff 2\nreported that she worked on the unit with Youth A and Youth B but\nshe left work at 9:00pm. Staff 2 reported she knows that 15 minute\nvariable interval checks are to be completed for this unit.\nAnalysis Staff 1 reported she did not perform variable eye-on checks with\nthe youth. Video observation confirms this.\nTechnical Assistance:\nStaff reported that she was new and did not know the program\nexpectations with the unit nor did she know the background\n(reason for care, trauma history, diagnosis, behavior cycles, etc.)\nof the youth she was serving. The agency is to make sure that\nstaff are prepared to provide the treatment outlined in their\n2",
    "program statement. Having access to the children’s history and\nthe program statement for the unit they are supervising should be\nprovided. The agency will need to look into their processes and\nstaffing to ensure staff know what program they are serving, the\nchildren they are serving and the expectations of that program.\nStaff 1 reported she did not do variable interval checks in the\nprogram she usually works with, which is also a requirement. The\nagency should make sure that all staff in all of their programs and\nlicenses are aware of this rule requirement.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n11/14/23\n______________________________________IR\nVenus M.

    "summary": "A special investigation at Vista Maria Open Residential found that Staff 1, a relatively new employee, failed to perform required 15-minute variable interval checks on residents, leaving them unsupervised for over two hours. During this lapse, two youth (Youth A and Youth B) were able to enter a bedroom together and engage in consensual sexual contact. Culpability lies primarily with the facility for inadequate staff training and oversight, as Staff 1 was assigned to an unfamiliar unit without proper knowledge of program rules or resident backgrounds.",
