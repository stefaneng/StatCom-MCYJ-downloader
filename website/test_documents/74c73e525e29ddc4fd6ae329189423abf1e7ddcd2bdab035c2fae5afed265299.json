The touching\noccurred over clothing with no penetration occurring. Youth B has\nbeen assaulted in the past and this triggered her. The staff were\nmade aware and ensured the children remained separate.\nInvestigation A second intake regarding these allegations was received on\n5/30/24 which stated “Last night, Youth B pulled Youth A into his\nroom and locked the door. He attempted to kiss, hump, and rape\nher. Youth C heard Youth A screaming and pushed the door in\nwith his shoulder. Staff was made aware, separated the youth,\nand have kept them a part”.\nA third intake regarding these allegations was received on 7/5/24\nwhich stated, “On an unknown date, Youth B raped Youth A. Staff\nwas told about the sexual assault, and they didn't do anything.\nThe details of the sexual assault are unknown.”\nINTERVIEWS:\nAll interviews were conducted separately, face to face at the\nfacility on 5/30/24.\nStaff 1 reported on 5/29/24, he was passing medications to youth\nwhile the other staff were in the main area of the facility. He\nreported Youth A came into the medication room and told him\nYouth B pulled her into his room, wouldn’t let her out, and ran his\nhands all over her body. Staff 1 reported he went into the bedroom\nhallway and provided supervision to ensure Youth A and Youth B\nwere separated. Staff 1 reported he has told youth and staff\nalmost every day for the last two weeks youth cannot be in each\nother’s rooms. Staff 1 reported the supervision policy is youth\nneed to always be in line of sight, but sometimes youth require 1:1\nsupervision and Youth A is one of those youth. Staff 1 reported no\nstaff were specifically assigned to any of the youth on 5/29/24, but\nall staff should know youth are not allowed to run in the facility or\ngo into each other’s rooms. Staff 1 reported Youth B is very\nhandsy with female staff, but he always corrects Youth B when he\nsees it. Staff 1 reported he has noticed Youth B trying to get closer\nto Youth A, but it’s normally seen in the form of roughhousing\nrather than any inappropriate touching. Staff 1 reported Youth B\nhasn’t had a safety plan in place for boundaries or supervision\nprior to this incident. Staff 1 reported as of today, the facility is\n2",
    "assigning each youth to a specific staff for supervision to ensure\nnothing like this happens again.\nYouth A reported she was playing tag in the bedroom hallway\nwith Youth B and Youth C. Youth A reported she went into Youth\nB’s bedroom two times on 5/29/24 when they were playing. Youth\nA reported the first time she went into Youth B’s room, Youth B\nshut the door, but nothing happened. Youth A reported the second\ntime, Youth B pushed her into his bedroom, and shut the door.\nYouth A reported Youth B had one of his hands holding the door\nshut so she couldn’t get out of his room, and Youth B’s other hand\nwas rubbing all over her body on top of her clothes. Youth A\nreported she told Youth B to stop, and then Youth C pushed the\ndoor open, so Youth B stopped. Youth A reported she left Youth\nB’s bedroom and immediately found Staff 1 and told him what\nhappened. Youth A reported there were no staff in the hallway\nwatching them until she told Staff 1 what happened. Youth A\nreported there were staff in the living room, which is by the\nbedroom hallway, but she couldn’t remember who.\nYouth B reported he and Youth A went into Youth B’s bedroom\none time. Youth B reported Youth A was leaning with her back up\nagainst his closed bedroom door, and he pretended to kiss Youth\nA, but didn’t do it. Youth B reported he put his hand against the\ndoor so Youth A couldn’t leave the room, but when Youth A told\nhim to stop, he stopped. Youth B reported he and Youth A were\nplaying a game called “booty bump” which is where you turn\naround and bump your butts together. Youth B reported when he\nand Youth A were playing in the hallway and went into his\nbedroom, there were no staff around, and he didn’t know where\nstaff were.\nStaff 2 reported on 5/29/24 he was sitting in the living room\nwatching TV with Youth D. Staff 2 reported he did not hear any\nyouth cry or scream for help. Staff 2 reported he only heard playful\nscreams from Youth A, Youth B and Youth C because they were\nrunning around playing with each other. Staff 2 reported he\nthought Staff 3 or Staff 4 were down the bedroom hallway\nsupervising the youth, so he wasn’t aware they were\nunsupervised. Staff 2 reported staff are not assigned to supervise\ncertain youth during their shift. Staff 2 reported Youth A went to\nget Staff 1 and Staff 1 went down the hallway with her. After Youth\nA told Staff 1 and Staff 2 what happened, Youth A asked if she\ncould go to Youth B’s room and talk to him since he was in his\nroom. Staff 2 reported he told her she could not go in Youth B’s\nroom but could talk to him while she was in the hallway. Youth A\n3",
    "stood outside Youth B’s room and told Youth A what he did to her\nreminded her of something that happened to her in her past, and\nsaid she needed a couple days away from him. Staff 2 reported\nYouth B apologized to Youth A, and they went their separate\nways. Staff 2 reported Youth B has a lot of boundary issues with\nyouth and staff. Staff 2 reported when youth or staff express their\ndesire to have certain boundaries in place, Youth B says people\nare being mean. Staff 2 reported he thought Youth B had a safety\nplan in place regarding keeping a safe distance from others prior\nto this incident but couldn’t give any specifics about the safety\nplan. Staff 2 was unable to provide any specifics regarding what\nthe facility’s supervision policy states but thought staff must be\nwithin a safe distance to supervise youth.\nStaff 3 reported Youth B wanted to build a fort in his room, but the\nwhole staff team is trying to stop forts from being built. Staff 3\nreported Youth B invited Youth A and Youth C into his room to\nhelp build a fort, and Staff 3 reported she was supervising them\nfrom the hallway. Staff 3 reported Youth C wanted to go outside,\nso she took Youth C outside. Staff 3 reported when she went\noutside with Youth C, Youth A and Youth B were still in Youth B’s\nroom together. Staff 3 reported she told other staff (couldn’t\nremember who) she was going outside with Youth C, and\nassumed someone would supervise Youth A and Youth B. Staff 3\nreported she didn’t directly tell any staff to supervise Youth A and\nYouth B because it’s not her job to tell other staff what to do. Staff\n3 reported after she brought Youth C back inside, Youth A, Youth\nB and Youth C were running up and down the hallway with each\nother. Staff 3 reported she thought she was in the hallway\nsupervising them, but when she was told the camera did not show\nher in the hallway, she reported she didn’t know where she was.\nStaff 3 reported Youth A pulled each staff aside to tell them what\nhappened between her and Youth B in Youth B’s bedroom shortly\nbefore bedtime. Staff 3 reported she had only been working at the\nfacility for two weeks and could not reiterate the requirements of\nthe facility’s supervision policy. Staff 3 reported there’s been a\ncouple times staff have been assigned specific youth to supervise\nduring their shift, but most of the time they’re not.\nStaff 4 reported she went outside with Staff 3, Youth A, Youth B,\nand Youth C before 7:00PM. Staff 4 reported Staff 3 brought\nYouth C in a little earlier, and she remained outside with Youth A\nand Youth B. Staff 4 reported around 6:55PM, she brought Youth\nA and Youth B inside, and told them to go to their rooms so she\ncould go to the kitchen and make them a snack. Staff 4 reported\nshe didn’t know what other staff were present, what they were\n4",
    "doing or where they were, but believed they were within sight of\nYouth A and Youth B when she brought them inside. Staff 4\nreported she did not directly communicate with any staff they\nwould need to supervise Youth A and Youth B because she was\ngoing to make a snack, but thought the other staff were in the\nsame area and heard when she told the youth she was going to\nthe kitchen. Staff 4 reported normally staff are not assigned\nspecific youth to supervise during the shift, but it has happened a\ncouple times. Staff 4 reported moving forward, staff are going to\nbe assigned specific youth to supervise during the shift because of\nthis situation. Staff 4 reported she had only been working at the\nfacility for three weeks, so she was not sure about the\nrequirements of the supervision policy but feels youth should\nalways be in staff’s line of sight. Staff 4 reported Youth B is very\ntouchy with female staff (i.e. hugs, wanting to lay on staff, bit her\nnipple recently), but she has never seen Youth B be this way with\nYouth A before. Staff 4 reported she wasn’t sure if Youth B had a\nsafety plan in place prior to this incident.\nSupervisor reported neither Youth A nor Youth B had a safety\nplan in place for boundaries prior to the incident occurring on\n5/29/24. However, Youth A is approved for and supposed to\nreceive 1:1 supervision.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 5/29/24 from 6:53-7:10PM was reviewed. Staff\n4, Youth A and Youth B are seen entering the facility from playing\noutside. Staff 3, Staff 4, Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C in the\nbedroom hallway. Staff 4 exits the hallway, and then Staff 3 also\nleaves the hallway. Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C are still in the\nhallway together. Youth A enters Youth B’s bedroom and Youth B\nis standing in the doorway. Then Youth A and Youth B enter the\nbedroom and shut the door. Within seconds, the door is open, but\nthen is closed again. Youth C pushes the door open, and Youth A\nexits the room. Youth B remains in his bedroom for a minute, then\nexits. Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C are playing in the hallway.\nYouth B then pushes Youth A against the wall in the hallway, tries\nto hold her still, and attempts to kiss her. Youth A fights to get out\nof his hold and runs down the hallway. No staff are present in the\nhallway watching them. Staff 3 comes back into the hallway, but\nthen leaves again. Youth B and Youth A go down the bedroom\nhallway and into Youth B’s bedroom. The bedroom door is shut,\nbut left cracked, and the two youth come out within seconds. Right\nafterwards, Youth A and Youth B go back into Youth B’s bedroom\nand shut the door all the way. They’re in Youth B’s room for\napproximately 30 seconds before they come out of the bedroom\n5",
    "and go back down the hallway. Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C\ncontinue walking and running up and down the bedroom hallway\nmultiple times. A few minutes later, Youth C pushes Youth A into\nYouth B’s room and shuts the door, while Youth C is in the\nhallway. Then Youth B pushes Youth C out of the way, and Youth\nA exits Youth B’s room. The three youth continue to run up and\ndown the bedroom hallway multiple times. No staff are present in\nthe hallway. Youth A and Youth B begin roughhousing in the\nhallway, including Youth B putting his arms around Youth A’s\nwaist. Youth A pushes Youth B away, and the three youth\ncontinue to run up and down the hallway. At 7:08PM, Youth A\nenters Youth B’s room, and Youth B follows her into his room and\nshuts the door. Less than a minute later, Youth C uses his\nshoulder and bangs up against the door. Youth A comes out of the\nroom and runs down the hallway. Youth B walks out of his room\nand stays in the hallway. Less than a minute later, Youth A comes\nback into the hallway with Staff 1 and they’re having a\nconversation. At 7:10PM, Staff 1 sits in a chair in the hallway and\nprovides supervision.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• House Rules for the facility states:\no Youth are to keep their hands to themselves (i.e. no\ntouching, handholding, hugging).\no Youth should not ever stand in a peer’s doorway or\nenter another peer’s room.\no Staff must always have sight of youth and\naccompany youth everywhere (except bathrooms\nand school).\n• Staffing Requirements and Supervision Policy (rev.\n11/1/23) states staff will provide supervision as specified in\nthe youth’s service plan.\n• Youth A’s Updated Residential Service Plan dated 5/1/24\nstates while in general areas of the home, staff will provide\nvisual supervision to ensure safety. It states Youth A is on\n1:1 supervision due to her behaviors.\n• Letter from Executive Director dated 2/29/24 requesting 1:1\nsupervision approval for Youth A from 3/12/24-6/9/24.\n• Email dated 6/6/24 from Executive Director stating Youth A\nwas supposed to be on 1:1 staffing on 5/29/24. In addition,\nthe facility does not have a specific policy outlining the 1:1\nsupervision requirement for staff.\n6",
    "• Youth B’s Initial Residential Service Plan dated 5/8/24\nstates while in general areas of the home, staff will provide\nvisual supervision to ensure Youth B’s safety. The\nGenacross Service Plan rating tool notes Youth B has a\nhistory of, or mild concern, for sexualized behavior. The\nservice plan does not identify any concerns related to being\nhandsy towards female staff or boundary issues as was\nreported during interviews with staff.\n• Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary actions in his\nemployee file. Staff 1 was trained on the supervision policy,\n1:1 supervision, and house rules during orientation in\nAugust 2023.\n• Staff 2 does not have any disciplinary actions in his\nemployee file. Staff 2 was trained on the supervision policy,\n1:1 supervision, and house rules during orientation in\nJanuary 2024.\n• Staff 3 and Staff 4 do not have any disciplinary actions in\ntheir employee files. Staff 3 and Staff 4 were trained on the\nsupervision policy, 1:1 supervision, and house rules during\norientation in May 2024.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance based on video footage\nreviewed, interviews conducted, and documentation reviewed.\nAlthough the facility had a sufficient number of staff present on\n5/29/24, staff failed to comply with supervision standards set forth\nby the facility’s policy, facility’s house rules, and did not abide by\nYouth A’s 1:1 supervision requirement.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTechnical assistance was offered as follows:\n• The agency to update their supervision policy to reflect\nthe following:\n• What staff are required to do if a youth does not have a\nspecific safety or supervision plan. House rules reflect\nstaff must always have sight of youth and accompany\nyouth everywhere, but supervision policy does not.\n• In the same sense, the supervision policy states staff\nwill provide supervision of youth based on what’s in the\nyouth’s service plan. However, the general language in\nthe case service plans for youth state “while in general\nareas of the home, staff will provide visual supervision\nof youth”, which is not consistent with the house rules.\n7",
    "• If there is going to be a requirement of specific youth\nbeing assigned to specific staff during the shift, the\npolicy should reflect that as well.\n• Requirements of staff for youth who have a 1:1\nsupervision plan should be clearly defined.\n• Staff have clear and direct communication with each\nother when they are no longer providing line of sight\nsupervision for youth.\n• Ensure service plans document and safety plans are\ndeveloped to address boundary concerns with youth as\nStaff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 4 reported Youth B has\nboundary issues, especially with female staff, but those\nconcerns were not reflected in his service plan, and\nthere was no established safety plan.\n• Establish process to ensure staff are made aware of\nspecific supervision requirements for youth.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2023C0000500 dated 7/15/23; CAP approved 9/11/23\nSIR #2023C0000532 dated 7/5/23; CAP approved 8/15/23\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJuly 5, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 12, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
