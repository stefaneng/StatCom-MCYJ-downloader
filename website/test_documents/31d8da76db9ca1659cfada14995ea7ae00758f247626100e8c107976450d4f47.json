ANALYST FINDINGS:\nNo safety concerns were identified by the DCWL analyst during this review period.\nV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nClarification was provided that quarterly IL agreements are required by licensing\nrules for youth in Young Adult Voluntary Foster Care, in addition to the YAVFC\ncontract being completed at the onset of the case.\n8",
    "Rule 327 requires the agency to provide a copy of a special evaluation report to the\ncaseworker of any children placed in the foster home. During this review it was\ndetermined that a report had not been provided to a caseworker. The agency stated\nthe report was not provided as the child was no longer in the home at the conclusion\nof the investigation. The agency was advised that although the rule does not\nspecify, the report should be provided to workers of children that are in the home at\nany time during the investigation, in order to keep the worker apprised of findings\nthat may involve the child.\nVI. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nDuring the review it was determined the agency had difficulty meeting the\nrequirement for DHHS-69 forms to be completed within three days of the court\nhearing for case closure, due to a delay in receiving court orders. The DHHS Policy\noffice was contacted and stated that the form could be counted as timely if it were\ncompleted within three days of receipt of the court order, rather than three days from\nthe closing hearing.\nVII. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP was submitted as a result of the 2/26/20 interim review. During this review\nperiod there were six repeat violations from the 2/26/20 interim evaluation and five\nrepeat violations from the 1/15/19 renewal evaluation. In most areas the occurrence\nof repeat violation was low. However, it is noted that there are several cases in\nwhich violations were found regarding Medical Passports, PATP signatures, and\nFTMs. Although it is understandable the agency had difficulty in these areas due to\nlimitations in contact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a CAP will need to be\ndeveloped to further address the violations.\n9",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or policy. Upon receipt of an acceptable\ncorrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of\ntheir regular license.\nJanuary 7, 2021\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 7, 2021\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n10"
