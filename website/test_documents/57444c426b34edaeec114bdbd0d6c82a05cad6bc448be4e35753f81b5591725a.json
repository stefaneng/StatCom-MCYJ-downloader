    "On 2/9/24 I interviewed Youth B who is age 13 and stands 4-feet,\n10-inches tall. He is much smaller in stature than Youth A and\nhas also been at the facility for one year. Youth B said Youth A\npushed him in the playroom by the computer (outside of camera’s\nview). “When I passed him, I pushed him. Youth A pushed back,\nand we started fighting.

In the playroom,\nthe boys “clashed and grabbed” at each other. “I verbally\nintervened. They fell to the ground I stepped in to break them up.\nYouth A said he couldn’t breathe.

He has been at\nthe facility for ten months.
