    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12607 Agency Recomendation\nSection • (4) An agency shall provide the applicants for adoption\nDescription with a signed and dated copy of the evaluation and\nrecommendation upon its completion.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that the agency did not provide the applicants\nwith a dated copy of the evaluation and recommendation.\nInvestigation The Complainant was interviewed on August 22, 2023, and\nSeptember 26, 2023. The Complainant is a agency worker with\nBethany Christian Services. The Complainant reported that Child\nand Family Services Northeast had conducted two family adoption\nassessments and had failed to provide the applicants with copies\nof the assessments. The Complainant reported that the case was\ntransferred per DHHS to Bethany Christian Services on June 12,\n2023. The Complainant reported that CFSNE had completed the\nassessments on May 26, 2023, and the agency had not provided\nthe families with the assessments from that time until the case\nwas transferred on June 12, 2023.\nStaff 1, the Adoption Supervisor for CFSNE was interviewed\non August 23, 2023, and September 26, 2023. The Adoption\nSupervisor reported that the agency had conducted adoption\nfamily assessments for two relatives, Relative A and Relative B.\nThe Adoption Supervisor reported that the agency did not agree\nwith the children being adopted by either Relative A or Relative B.\nThe Adoption Supervisor reported that Relative A had a\nsubstantial criminal history as well as CPS involvement. The\nAdoption Supervisor also reported that the children had vocalized\nthat they did not want to be placed with Relative A. The Adoption\nSupervisor further reported that the children had vocalized that\nthey did not want to be placed with Relative B due to past\nemotional and physical abuse.\nThe Adoption Supervisor reported that the agency did not send\nthe adoption assessments to either family because the case was\nbeing transferred and Bethany Christian Services was to conduct\nreassessments of Relative A and Relative B per DHHS. The\nAdoption Supervisor reported that DHHS felt that CFSNE was\nbiased against the relatives and wanted reassessments. The\n2",
    "Adoption Supervisor reported that the initial assessments were\ncompleted on May 26, 2023, and the case was transferred to\nBethany on June 12, 2023. The Adoption Supervisor reported that\nsending denial letters to the relatives could make reassessments\nfor Bethany more difficult. This and the understanding that\nreassessments were to be completed by Bethany were the factors\nin the agency not sending the assessments to the relatives. The\nAdoption Supervisor reported that she could not specifically recall\nwho from DHHS wanted reassessments to occur with the new\nagency.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed on September 26,\n2023. The Chief Administrator reiterated and confirmed the\ninformation received from the Adoption Supervisor. The Chief\nAdministrator stated that the assessments and denial letters were\nnot sent to Relative A and Relative B as the case was being\ntransferred to a Bethany Christian Services and DHHS wanted the\nnew agency to reassess the families.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nCase File Review: The case file documents that family adoption\nassessments for Relative A and Relative B were completed on\nMay 26, 2023. In each case the agency was recommending denial\nof the adoption placements.\nEmail correspondence: Email correspondence between the\nAdoption Supervisor and the DHHS Monitor dated August 11, and\n14, 2023, suggest that Bethany Christian Services will be\nreassessing Relative A and Relative B.\nEmail correspondence between the Adoption Supervisor and the\nComplainant dated July 6, and 12, 2023, was reviewed. An email\ndated July 6, 2023, from the Adoption Supervisor to the\nComplainant states that the families were not notified of the\nassessments and denials. An email dated July 11, 2023, from the\nAdoption Supervisor to the Complainant states the families were\nnot notified because Bethany would be reassessing the families.\nAnalysis The agency did not send the relatives denial letters and the\nassessments as the case was being transferred to another\nagency. The agency was also operating under the assumption\nthat Relative A and Relative B were to be reassessed by the new\nagency holding the case.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n3",
    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities\nSection • (3) An agency shall require that social service workers\nDescription be directly responsible for all of the following activities:\n• (a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-\nhome care. Social service workers shall work\ndirectly with the children, their families, and\nother relevant individuals and be primarily\nresponsible for the development,\nimplementation, and review of service plans for\nthe children and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that the agency worker was refusing to provide\nall parties with a copy of the written adoptive assessments.\nInvestigation The Adoption Worker reported that she had not refused to send\nall parties the completed assessments. The Adoption Supervisor\nreported that the completed assessments were on the MISACWIS\nsystem for DHHS and Bethany Christian Services staff to review.\nIn an email dated August 11, 2023, to the DHHS Monitor the\nAdoption Supervisor states that after the case was transferred to\nBethany on June 12, 2023, CFSNE no longer held the case and\nshe was no longer the supervisor, therefore, CFSNE would not be\nmaking a recommendation or sending out denial letters.\nAnalysis The adoption family assessments were available on the\nMISACWIS system for review by Bethany staff and DHHS. The\nassessments and denial letters were not sent to the families for\nthe reasons outlined under R. 400.12607 above and after June\n12, 2023, the agency no longer held the case.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nThe recommendation is for continuance of the regular license.\n4",
