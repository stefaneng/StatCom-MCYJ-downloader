    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP submitted was in response to the 6/29/2023 licensing renewal inspection\nreport approved on 7/18/2023. That CAP addressed five violations, three of which\nwere repeated this year. All three of those violations were also established in 2022\nand will require an assessment of the continued violations and additional\ncorrective action planning. The agency is in compliance with the other two areas\naddressed in the 2023 CAP. Of the additional six violations established during this\nyear's inspection, four were also established in 2022 and will require an\nassessment and additional corrective action planning. Two violations established\nthis year have not been repeated in the past. The majority of violations established\nthis year were located in one or two files reviewed while only two violations were\nfound in four files.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was provided and reviewed. The chief\nadministrator indicated there has been improved compliance since the\nimplementation of last year's CAP. She stated they have implemented the use of\ncalendar reminders, email reminders, monthly CAP review meetings, quarterly\nquality review meetings, and use of BOB & KPI data.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed all described positive experiences working at the agency.\nMore than one staff member reported the reason they stay at the agency, despite\nthe job being difficult, is due to the support and encouragement they receive from\ndirect supervision. No concerns were reported by any of the staff.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office appears to adequate space and equipment to provide for the\ndelivery of foster care, foster home certification, and independent living services.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo Safety Concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n9",
