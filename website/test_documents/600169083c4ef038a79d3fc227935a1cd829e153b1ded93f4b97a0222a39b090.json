The clients served by the facility are not part of the plaintiff class and therefor the\nfacility is not required to follow the ISEP.\n3.) The facility does not hold a contract with MDHHS/Children Services, so it is not\nsubject to contract or policy requirements.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility did not require technical assistance at this time.\n5",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require consultation at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has not been required to submit any corrective action plans this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility continues to struggle with ensuring staff are getting yearly TB tests and\nCentral Registry Clearances (CRC). All staff files reviewed of employees who have\nbeen working for the facility longer than a year indicated no current CRC’s where ran\nin over a year. One employee did not have one run in over two years. The same was\nfound for the other facility that was reviewed at the same time. Both facilities fall\nunder Samaritas and their employee files are maintained by the same person. The\nfacility was required to run CRC’s on all staff who have worked for the facilities longer\nthan a year prior to the completion of this inspection. As of the writing of this report all\nclearances have been run. As indicated in the citations above, this is not a new issue.\nThis was noted as a violation in the facility’s last two inspections. The facility needs to\ntake deliberate and concerted action in order to correct these deficiencies.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the facility continue on their regular license.\n10/15/20\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6",
