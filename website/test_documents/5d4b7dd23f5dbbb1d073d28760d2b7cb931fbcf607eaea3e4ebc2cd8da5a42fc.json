    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff allegedly saw youth naked in her cell.\nInvestigation On 11/28/23, I spoke to Administrator 1. Allegations were\ndiscussed. Administrator 1 reported Staff 1 had found contraband\nin the girls' unit and was going to talk to them about the\nconsequences. Administrator 1 reported this is not the first-time\nallegations were made from Youth A. Administrator 1 reported that\nYouth A and her mother are attempting to remove her from\nplacement, and this might be the way they are attempting to do it.\nOn 11/28/23 I spoke to Complainant 1 via telephone. Complainant\n1 reported she did not see the incident and did not provide any\nmore information than the current allegations.\nI reviewed the video of the alleged incident on 12/1/23. The\nalleged incident was dated 11/20/23 at 9:13:29pm. All the youth\nare in their bedrooms with the doors closed, preparing for\nbedtime. Staff 1 walks down the hallway and stops to talk at one\nyouth through the door. After Staff 1 talks with this youth, Staff 1\nthen goes to the next door, which is Youth A's door. Looks at the\ndoor/window and quickly turns away. At 9:27, Staff 2 goes to\nYouth A's door and talks through the door.\nInterviews:\nYouth A:\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 12/1/23. Youth A reported\nthat last week Staff 1 came down the hallway and looked into her\ncell, said, \"my bad\", and walked away. Youth A reported she did\nnot have her clothes on and was changing. Youth A reported that\nStaff 2 then came down later and apologized for Staff 1. Staff 2\nreported to her that Staff 1 apologized but didn't see anything but\nknew quicky to look away. Youth A reported Staff 1 has never said\nor acted in a way that made her uncomfortable before.\n2",
    "Staff 1:\nI interviewed Staff 1 via telephone on 12/5/23. Staff 1 reported that\nhe was working on the unit when they found contraband in the\ngirls' boxes. Staff 1 reported that their supervisor gave them\npermission to go through the boxes. Four youth had items and\nStaff 1 was going to the rooms of those with contraband to talk to\nthem. Staff 1 was under the impression that all youth were\ndressed at this time. Staff 1 reported that when they are preparing\nfor bedtime, they go into their room and then get dressed. Staff 1\nreported that Staff 2, female staff would have gone down the\nhallway to make sure everyone was ready for bed. Staff 1\nreported he was under the impression that was done because\nStaff 2 was with him when he stated he was going to talk to the\ngirls. Staff 1 reported he went down the hallway and went to knock\non her door, when he noticed the outline of her body or shadow,\nhe quickly turned away and sent Staff 2 to talk to her about it. Staff\n1 reported he told the supervisor about what happened. Staff 1\nreported that a couple weeks ago he consequented Youth A and a\ncouple other girls and they have been discussing ways to get \"him\nfired.\"\nI left a voicemail for Staff 2 on 12/1, 12/5, and 12/20/23. Staff 2 did\ncall back after the 12/5/23 voicemail but was then unable to be\nreached, so there is no interview noted.\nI reviewed Staff 1's personnel file. There is no disciplinary action in\nhis file and all training is up to date.\nThe facility does not have a policy stating males cannot supervise\nfemale units.\nAnalysis Staff 1 did see Youth A without clothes on but not intentionally.\nVideo and both Staff 1 and Youth A's interviews all confirm that\nStaff 1 turned away quickly after he looked into Youth A's\nbedroom.\nConsultation:\nIt is recommended that staff formally notify other staff on the unit\nwhen youth are in their rooms to change, and once it has been\nconfirmed they are all changed so all staff on the unit are aware.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended the license remain unchanged.\n12/27/23\n______________________________________\nVenus M. Decker Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 27, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n4"
