CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nR400.12212 Employee record (4).\nThe agency is advised consistently indicating the specific name of the training,\nnumber of hours and person completing the training on its training log may aid it in\nshowing clear documentation of the rule. This would be inclusive of documenting\nwhat specific training was held at a staff meeting, not just indicating “staff meeting”\nas the training.\nR400.12509 Independent living record(3)(o).\nConsultation was given pertaining to more refinement of the agency’s service plan,\nso it more clearly shows the plan’s completion date, service time frame dates,\nyouth’s current adjustment, assessment of level of independent functioning and\nprogress in achieving the youth’s independence goal.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThis corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2017 Interim Inspection. At that\ntime the agency received three rule violations. Those violations were R400.12206\nStaff qualifications (connected to the agency requiring annual tuberculosis\nscreening); R400.12212(2)(h) for Personnel records; and R400.12509(3)(o) for\nIndependent living record. The agency did not receive any repeat violations from\nthat Interim inspection, or the last three years. It is in compliance with its Interim\ncorrective action plan.\nThe agency is at full resident capacity and reports it has had steady placement this\nyear. The agency received a $200,000 Health and Services grant. These funds\nhave enabled it to hire another case manager and an assistant case manager; and\nto develop a Homeless Prevention Program. The Homeless Prevention Program will\noffer services to homeless young adults while those individuals pursue housing. It\nwill also enable them to advance residents who reside in their Transition Living\nProgram to home occupancy in one of two of their two-bedroom rental properties\nthat they are developing to provide assisted independent living services.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\n5",
