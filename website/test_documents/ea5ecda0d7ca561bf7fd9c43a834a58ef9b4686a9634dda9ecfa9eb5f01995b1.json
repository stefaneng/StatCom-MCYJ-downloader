Supervisor reported Youth A disclosed they were\nsexually abused three different times and was frustrated no one\nwas believing them. It was reported one of the assaults may have\nbeen with Youth B which Supervisor does not know if that was a\nsituation that occurred at school on April 11, 2023, or not. The\nsupervisor reported he did not ask Youth A any more questions.\nSupervisor reported Youth B is no longer at the facility.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on June 1,\n2023. Youth A reported they have been getting frustrated with the\nyouth at the facility as they do not believe them about Youth B\nsexually assaulting them. They reported since Youth B left the\nfacility, they are getting some pushback from the other youth and\nthat is why they yelled out the other day about frustrations of no\none believing them of the sexual assaults. Youth A reported the\nsexual assault that occurred with Youth B happened at the off-\ncampus school back in April. They got frustrated with this\nconsultant as they have already spoken to this consultant about\nthis. Youth A reported after the school incident occurred, staff put\nthem on a Peer Boundary Safety plan and moved Youth B to a\ndifferent home. They reported staff do a good job at supervision\nand that is why there was never a sexual assault that occurred at\nthe facility or when staff were supervising them. Youth A reported\nthe other sexual assaults occurred prior to their stay at the facility\nand they have dealt with law enforcement about it. Youth A was\nvery adamant that they did not want to speak with law\nenforcement or move forward with any charges. They reported\nthey are frustrated with the whole system and just wanted to be\nleft alone. Youth A reported the only person they trust talking\nabout this with is their mother.\n2",
    "Youth B was interviewed face to face at another facility on\nMay 31, 2023. Youth B reported he was previously in a\nrelationship with Youth A because they were going to off-site\nschooling together. He reported Youth A got upset with him\nbecause he turned over their contraband of a cell phone and\ntelling staff that Youth A had a vape. Youth B reported they got\ncaught by school staff in the bathroom together at school, which\nwas reported to the facility. He reported he did not want to talk\nabout if there were sexual acts that occurred at school but\nreported if anything did happen Youth A was the one encouraging\nit. Youth B reported when the facility found out he got put on peer\nboundaries status, meaning he had heightened supervision, and\nhad to move to another home on campus. Youth B reported there\nwas no other time he had a sexual relationship with Youth A\nbesides the one time at school. He reported they never had sexual\nacts at the facility or when they were under the facility staff's\nsupervision. Youth B reported staff at the facility are on top of\nsupervising the youth and he would not be able to get away with\nthat if he wanted to. He reported Youth A is mad at him for\nreporting their contraband and feels he got their parent in trouble\nfrom the last investigation.\nTherapist and Case Manager were interviewed face to face\nseparately at the facility on May 31, 2023. Therapist and Case\nManager are both assigned to work with Youth A while they are\nplaced at the facility. Youth A has reported to both Therapist and\nCase Manager about being sexually assaulted previously by their\nfather. Therapist and Case Manager both reported that sexual\nassault was called into CPS to be investigated prior and Youth A\nrefused to speak to law enforcement. Therapist and Case\nManager reported in April 2023, Youth A and Youth B were caught\nat the off-grounds school together in the bathroom with concerns\nof sexual activity occurring between them. It was reported Youth A\nand Youth B may have been in a relationship with one another\nduring that time. Youth A at first refused to talk about it to either\nTherapist or Case Manager. Youth A later reported Youth B had\nsexually assaulted them at school and this was reported to CPS\nand Law Enforcement. At that time, Youth A refused to talk to law\nenforcement. After the incident was reported from school, Youth A\nand Youth B were put on peer boundaries safety plan and Youth B\nmoved to the other home on campus. Therapist and Case\nManager reported Youth A has brought concerns about doing\nsexual favors to get contraband but that was investigated prior in\nApril 2023 (Investigation #2023C0000402). Youth A has been\noffered to call law enforcement any time when they bring these\nconcerns up to both Therapist and Case Manager. There has\n3",
    "never been a report of sexual assault occurring at the facility or\nwhen Youth A is being supervised by staff. The reported sexual\nassault concerns were reported to take place at off grounds\nschool or before Youth A was placed at the facility. Therapist and\nCase Manager both have been involved with the school in reports\nto this concern.\nChief Administrator was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on May 31, 2023. Chief Administrator reported on April\n11, 2023, the facility received a call from Youth A and Youth B’s\noff-grounds school reporting concerns of sexual activity occurring\nin the school’s bathroom with both youths. It was reported Youth A\nand Youth B appeared to be dating one another. Once this\ninformation was received, a Peer Boundaries Safety plan was\ncompleted with both youth which increased the supervision level\nfor both youths. Chief Administrator reported Youth B was moved\nto the other house on campus and later discharged from the\nfacility on 05/19/2023.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were interviewed face to face separately at\nthe facility on June 1, 2023. Staff 1 and Staff 2 reported the only\nsexual assault incident they were aware of was the incident that\noccurred with Youth A and Youth B at an off-ground school in\nApril. When that report came through the facility notified the staff\nimmediately for heightened supervision and proceeded to move\nYouth B to another house. Staff 1 and Staff 2 were knowledgeable\nof the peer boundary safety plan. They both reported Youth A has\na history of sexual abuse and concerns about prostitution. Staff 1\nreported since Youth B left the facility Youth A has been getting\ninto arguments with other peers in the house about their\nrelationship with Youth B. Staff 1 reported these situations are\nbeing redirected and addressed with the peers involved.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n- Facility Youth Supervision Procedure with the most\nrecent revision date of June 2022- Staff are responsible\nfor the direct supervision of youth living in the house in\nwhich they are working. To ensure appropriate supervision,\nstaff responsible for youth must: maintain visual contact\nand monitoring of the youth; know where each youth is at\nall times; be physically present in close proximity to the\nyouth; clearly communicate when the supervision of youth\ntransfers to another staff person; ensure hallways are being\nmonitored at all times when youth are in their rooms, den,\nbathrooms, laundry room, common hallway space or med\ncart area. If a staff member must leave their post as direct\n4",
    "supervisor of the hallway, they will notify another staff to\ntake over this supervision.\n- Facility Incident report dated April 11, 2023 at 7pm-\nStaff received a call from the local off ground high school\nreported Youth A and Youth B have been suspended from\nschool due not being where they were supposed to be\nduring school hours. School reported after reviewing\ncamera footage, it was found that Youth A and Youth B\nentered the unisex bathroom and spent about 7 minutes in\nthe unisex bathroom. Youth A and Youth B exited\nseparately, Youth B walked into the men’s bathroom and\nexited after spending a short period of time before returning\nback to where he was supposed to be during school. The\ninformation was relayed to the Therapist and Chief\nAdministrator which led to the Peer Boundaries plan being\nput in place first thing the next morning.\n- Youth A’s Peer Boundaries form dated April 12, 2023-\nThis form was completed due to a peer boundary issue with\nYouth B at school 04/11/2023. Staff must be between\nYouth A and peers at all times. Youth A must be in line of\nsight when in the milieu.\n- Email from Law Enforcement dated May 31, 2023- “Law\nEnforcement will not be assigned for further investigation at\nthis time as this has been previously investigated with the\nparties involved. There was no concerning evidence found\nand Youth A refused to speak with Law Enforcement.”\nAnalysis The facility is compliance of following their internal supervision\npolicy.
