The result of this review must be documented in the\ninitial case service plan.\nIf further assessment is warranted, the DHS-3130A must be\ncompleted within 45 calendar days of removal. If the\nplacement recommendation on the DHS-3130A is approved,\nthe child must be placed with the relative.\nANALYSIS: The agency failed to complete the Relative Placement Home\nStudy, DHS-3130-A, within 45 days.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",
