    "resident. Administrator 1 reported Youth A was resistant and continued to hit, bite, and\nkick. Staff 1 was unable to implement a proper restraint and Youth A fell to the floor and\nstarted to self-harm by banging his own head on the floor causing a bloody nose. Youth\nA was on the floor in a prone position during the restraint. The restraint lasted for\napproximately 15 minutes. Staff 1 attempted to hold the head of Youth A to keep Youth\nA from self-harming. Administrator 1 stated Youth A was taken for medical treatment\nfollowing the restraint and no injuries were noted. Administrator 1 stated a nurse\ninterviewed Youth A, and X-Rays were taken that revealed Youth A did not have any\nfractures. Administrator 1 stated there was a video of the incident that was reviewed by\nAdministrator 1 but was not able to be sent for my review. Administrator 1 stated the\nimplementation of the restraint was not consistent with the behavior management\nrestraint training of the facility because Youth A was restrained in a prone position\ninstead of a supine position when Youth A was on the floor.\nAdministrator 1 submitted medical information related to the incident. The medical\ninformation documented the diagnosis that Youth A did not have any fractures as a\nresult of the incident. Administrator 1 also submitted the behavior management training\nrecord for Staff 1. Staff 1 last completed behavior management training on 05/10/2019.\nA telephone conference was completed on 03/27/2020 with State Worker 1 and the\nfoster care worker for Youth A.

The policies and procedures shall be\nreviewed annually and updated as needed. These shall be\navailable to all residents, their families, and referring\nagencies.\nANALYSIS: The findings of this investigation substantiate that Staff 1\nimplemented an improper restraint of Youth A by restraining\nYouth A in a prone position. Administrator 1 stated that her\nvideo review confirmed the restraint was inconsistent with the\nbehavior management/restraint training provided by the facility.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",
