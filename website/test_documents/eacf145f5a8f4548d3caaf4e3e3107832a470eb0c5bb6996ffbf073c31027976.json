INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (1) A child caring institution, including private secure juvenile\njustice facilities, shall establish a process improvement and\nrestraint reduction/elimination plan that:\n1",
    "(d) Staff must complete refresher training annually or more\nfrequently as needed.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff do not have restraint training completed as required.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nThe Complainant is this Consultant. Information was\ndiscovered during Corrective Action Plan (CAP) Follow-Up which\nindicated staff did not complete annual restraint training as\nrequired.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via phone on 4/25/24. Supervisor\nreported the facility only has two CPI trainers and it has been\ndifficult to get all staff to complete training within the limited\ntimeframes the trainers are available. Supervisor reported there\nwere staff signed up for training in December 2023, but the\ntraining was cancelled, which caused staff to become overdue.\nSupervisor reported this has been an ongoing concern and agrees\nit needs to be addressed.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via phone on 4/25/24. Supervisor\n2 reported CPI cards they receive after training provide an\nexpiration which is over 365 days from the time they completed\ntraining (i.e. training is completed 3/5/24, then the expiration is\nlisted as 12/31/25). Supervisor 2 reported their restraint policy\nsays training will be completed annually, but they have considered\nannually once within the calendar year versus once within every\n365 days. Supervisor 2 reported they’re currently working on\nupdating the restraint policy and will add clarification on the annual\ntraining requirement.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Chart of TLC staff CPI training dates shows 5 employees\nare overdue with their annual restraint training.\no Supervisor 1 last completed training on 3/12/23.\no Staff 1 last completed training on 10/10/22.\no Staff 2 last completed training on 2/13/23.\no Staff 3 last completed training on 10/10/22.\no Staff 4 last completed training on 3/8/23.\n• Bethany Christian Services Emergency Physical Restraint\nPolicy and Procedures (rev. 8/10/22) states staff will be\ntrained through CPI annually.\n2",
    "Analysis Based on interviews conducted and documents reviewed, this\nviolation is established. Dates of training provided for staff through\nTLC confirm there are currently 5 employees out of compliance\nwith annual training. Supervisor 1 (TLC Program) and Supervisor\n2 (Ridgeview Program) confirmed staff are not always completing\nCPI refresher trainings within 365 days of previous training.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nMay 3, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 3, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3"
