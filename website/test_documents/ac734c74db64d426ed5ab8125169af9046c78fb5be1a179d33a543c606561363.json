The corrective action plan was in response\nto the 2020 Renewal inspection. The agency has previously shown great growth in\ntheir casework and case files however during this period under review they had five\nrepeat violations and twelve new violations. The Chief Administrator reports the\nagencies biggest barrier was the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability to do\ncasework in person which created obstacles for both licensing and foster care. Chief\nAdministrator reported that the agency has also had some staff changes during the\npandemic which has also created some challenges. Overall, some of the great\nchanges that the agency has made needs to be reestablished over the course of the\nnext year.\nDuring interviews with staff, they reported an overall satisfaction with the supervision\nand support provided by their direct supervisors, coworkers, and administration in\ntheir office. Staff reported there is a lot of teamwork between coworkers,\nsupervisors, and the administration which helps them to learn their job better and\nfeel more supported.\nVII.

The DCWL\nField Analyst identified a portable heating unit being used in the children’s bedroom,\nand no smoke detector on the main level of the home. The agency was provided this\ninformation on April 22, 2021. The agency fully rectified the above issues by having\nthe caregivers remove the portable heating unit and install a smoke detector and\nsent picture verification to me on April 27, 2021.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\n12",
