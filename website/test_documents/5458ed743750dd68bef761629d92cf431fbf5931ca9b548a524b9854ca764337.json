She stated she does not agree with Youth A taking\nmedications and Youth A has never been tested for having ADHD.\nParent 1 stated she received information that Youth A was taking\n2",
    "medication at a parenting time meeting and Youth A informed her\nhe was taking crushed medication and that it was placed in his\napplesauce.\nParent 1 said she wanted to do her own investigation, so she\nreached out to Youth A’s teacher to find out his behaviors in her\nclassroom. She said the teacher reported Youth A does\nabsolutely fantastic at school. She said the teacher reported\nYouth A always comes to class with a smile on his face and a\npositive attitude and he has no problems making friends.

FCW stated Parent 1 continued to question Youth A\nabout the medication, and she intervened and reminded Parent 1\nthat Youth A was only five years old and does not know what kind\nof medicine he is taking. FCW stated she shared with Parent 1\nthat it is not uncommon for children to have pills or vitamins\ncrushed in applesauce or yogurt to get them to take their\nmedication. She said she informed Parent 1 that she (FCW)\nwould do a follow up with Foster Parent 1.\nFCW stated Parent 1 texted Foster Parent 1 during the parenting\nvisit and asked what type of pill she was giving Youth A that had\nto be crushed and placed in his applesauce. FCW said Foster\nParent 1 told Parent 1 to address the issue with Youth A’s FCW.\nFCW stated this is when she learned Foster Parent 1 was giving\nYouth A medicine for ADHD.

She\nsaid this was the first time she had seen the medication list that\nYouth A was taking, and the Department was not aware of this\nmedication, nor did Parent 1 give her consent for Youth A to take\nthe medication. She said both the Department and Parent 1\nlearned that Youth A was taking medication for ADHD at the same\ntime. FCW said she provided the list of medications, the CMH\nform and Youth A’s ADHD diagnosis to Parent 1. FCW stated\nanytime Youth A has any type of appointments she informs Parent\n1 when she receives notifications of any appointments.

She said there were 30 pills\nand Youth A had taken four and 26 of them were left in the bottle.\nFCW stated Youth A was taking the psychotropic medication\nConcerti/methylphenidate.\nFoster Parents 1 and 2 were interviewed on 7/1/2024. Both\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 agreed that giving the\npsychotropic medication to Youth A without getting the consent\nfrom the caseworker and parent was their fault and that they take\n4",
    "full responsibility. Both admitted they were aware of the agency\npolicies and procedures, and they had signed and dated the\npolicies and procedures beforehand. Foster Parent 2 added when\nthe caseworker informed them to stop giving Youth A the pills,\nthey discontinued immediately. He said it was evidence when the\ncaseworker came out to their home and received 26 pills where 4\npills were administered to Youth A before they were told to\ndiscontinue providing the pills to Youth A. Both reported they were\nnever given permission to start Youth A on psychotropic\nmedication. Both stated they know their mistake; they have a\nsafety plan in place, and they are following it.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Psychosocial assessment dated September 19, 2023,\nprovided Youth A with a diagnosis of ADHD (attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder), combined type F90.2.\nDiagnosis Rationale states Youth A meets diagnostic\ncriteria for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined\ntype. Foster Parent 1 reported to the tester that Youth A\nlacks attention to detail and makes frequent mistakes, he is\ninattentive with tasks, seems to ignore people speaking\ndirectly to him, and fails to complete tasks or instructions.\nYouth A is disorganized, misplaces possessions related to\ntasks and is often distracted. Foster Parent 1 reported to\nthe tester that Youth A is restless, leaves his seat and runs\nor climbs when it is not appropriate. Youth A talks\nenergetically and excessively, answers questions before\nthey are finished and interrupts others when talking.\n• Per MiSACWIS; a DHHS investigation was opened on the\nfoster parent’s home on November 28, 2023, by the\nassigned agency. The allegation was Foster Parent 1 took\nYouth A to the doctor and pretended to be his mother so\nshe could put Youth A on ADHD medication. Once she\nobtained the medication, Foster Parent 1 began crushing\nthe medication up and putting the medication into Youth A’s\napple sauce. Foster Parent 1 was in violation with CPA\nrule 400.9412 (1) Medical and dental care and 400.9403 (1)\n(a) Foster parent duties. The DHHS report\nrecommendation was a corrective action plan which was\nsigned and dated by Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2\non December 7, 2023, along with a safety plan that was\nsigned and dated by the foster parents on November 30,\n2023.\n5",
    "• Per CWLM record, agency policies and procedures; foster\nparent agency agreement, states the foster parent shall\nread and demonstrate an understanding of foster home\nlicensing rules, and state and agencies policies and\nprocedures. This documented was signed by both foster\nparents on November 28, 2023.\n• Per documentation in CWLM, the Foster Parent 1 and\nFoster Parent 2 were provided all of the agency policies\nand procedures. All policies and procedures were signed\nand dated by Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 where\nYouth A was placed. It is noted that they have been\nlicensed since January 9, 2021 with Bethany Christian\nServices – Holland. Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2\nwere aware and have signed all of the agency policies and\nprocedures.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. It is true that Foster Parent 1\nprovided medication to Youth A without Parent 1’s consent. It is\ntrue that Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 did not inform the\nDepartment, FCW nor Bethany Christian Services - Holland that\nthey had taken Youth A to Foster Parent 1’s pediatrician and\nreceived medication for ADHD and began administrating the\nmedication to Youth A in applesauce. Foster Parent 1 and Foster\nParent 2 did not inform the Department that she took Youth A to\nher pediatrician for ADHD medication, nor did Foster Parent 1 and\nFoster Parent 2 receive consent from Parent 1 regarding her\napproval for this medication to be administered. However, the\nassigned agency provided Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2\nwith all of the agency’s policies and procedures as required which\nwas signed and dated by the foster parents upon being licensed\nand Youth A being placed in the home.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
