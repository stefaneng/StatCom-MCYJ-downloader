    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP submitted by the agency was in response to the 2023 renewal inspection\nreport dated 07/18/2023. That CAP was approved on 08/04/2023 and addressed\nthree citations, all of which were related to policy citations. The agency has\nachieved and maintained compliance with that CAP in one area, medical\npassports, as evidenced by the violation not being repeated during this year's\ninspection. The agency did not maintain compliance related to PATP signatures\nand FTMs and will require additional corrective action planning. There is an\nincrease in citations from three (3 policy) in 2023 to nine (7 rule & 2 policy) in\n2024; however, three of the citations established this year were within one IL\nyouth's file. None of the violations establishes were pervasive or consistent in\nnature.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was received and reviewed during the\nentrance meeting. The chief administrator identified FTMs as an area in which\nthere has been difficulty maintaining compliance. She reported the previous year's\nCAP has been implemented well and has been successful. Multiple unplanned\nplacement changes has occurred and experienced difficulty locating appropriate\nplacement for youths with high needs.\nFinancial Overview\nNot Applicable.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed did not report any concerns. They all state they receive\nregular and frequent supervision. They state supervision has increased their\nsupport and assistance over the past year. They all also feel spreadsheets and\nmeeting requirements implemented after the last CAP have been helpful.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to provide foster\ncare, licensing, and independent living service delivery. CHRI is stored in a locked\ncabinet and cross shredding is available on-site.\n7",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nSeptember 6, 2024\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 6, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
