    "INVESTIGATION:\n The complainant reported that over the course of the ongoing case involving\nthe foster child A placed in their home, the employees at Growing Hope\nThrough Love have provided little oversight and failed to follow Court orders\non her case. It was reported that the primary caseworker failed to read Court\norders resulting in the foster child participating in overnight visits with her\nhomeless father despite Court orders directing otherwise. The complainant\nalleged that the case worker has consistently failed to address the\nhomelessness of the foster child's father or to adequately document agency\nconcerns.\n It is noted that the former caseworker no longer works for Growing Hope\nThrough Love however, she was available via by telephone.\nAn interview was held with the director of the program via email, onsite and\ntelephone. She reported she acknowledge the seriousness and the concerns of\nthe complainant. She reported that the allegation possible stems from concern of\nreunification of the foster child with her biological father. The director reported\nthe case has been going on since 2017 with reunification being the goal. She\nreported that the father had a lack of progress made within policy required\ntimeframes therefore, at a permanency planning hearing held in December of\n2018 the agency plan to file a supplemental petition and currently the agency is\nin the process of trial of the case.\nThis consultant reviewed the court reports for foster child A regarding the\nallegation.\n Court order dated 10/04/2017 in summary states the court report and\ntestimony indicated the father is compliant with court ordered services.\nThe court order states the father’s home was assessed and deemed\nsuitable. The court ordered the recommendation allowing the worker\ndiscretion for unsupervised visits for the father.\n Court order dated 12/18/17 in summary states the father is back in\ncompliant with the court ordered services. The father previously missed a\nmonth of parenting time visits. Father is back employed due to\nattendance problem created by attending parenting time visits. Supportive\nvisitation is pending and he is at the top of the waiting list. Father is not\nattending doctor appointments due to the appointments being in another\ncounty over an hour away. The agency provides bus tickets and gas\ncards. The court continued the recommendation allowing the worker\ndiscretion for unsupervised visits.\n Court order dated 03/26/2018 in summary states the court report and\ntestimony indicated the father has had several unsupervised visits in\nJanuary and February 2018 with the first unsupervised visit occurring on\n12/29/2017.

    "with the birth mom (Rights terminated) and that he received a citation.\nThe agency had concerns regarding the father’s continued association\nwith the birth mom. As a result of the agency concern, the assigned\ncaseworker has resumed supervised visits with the father. All prior orders\nare continued except where modified.\n Court order dated 06/04/2018 in summary states the father is ordered\nsupervised visits by DHHS and or its designee. The court report\ntestimony indicated the father is partially compliant. The father has\nappropriate housing, due to the distance from his residence and place of\nemployment, he does not stay at the home daily. All prior orders are\ncontinued except where modified.\n Court order dated 08/15/2018 in summary adopted the recommendation\nallowing the assigned caseworker desecration for unsupervised visits up\nto and including overnights for the father once the home had been\nassessed and deemed appropriate. All prior orders are continued except\nwhere modified.\n The court orders per testimony/court reports, the foster child updated\nservice plans and parent agency treatment agreements all detailed the\nbiological father progress in meeting the requirements being in compliance\nwith the agency and courts recommendations as well as what he needed\nto improve upon/barriers for reunification of foster child A.\nThe director reported that the agency caseworker believed that the agency still\nhad discretion for unsupervised visits as it had been their discretion since\n10/04/2018.

She reported a day visit occurred on\n07/21/18. She said the agency unfortunately made an error of the overnight\nvisits despite the court order directing otherwise. This information was in the\ncourt order that occurred on 03/26/2018. The director reported the agency went\nback to supervised visit on 07/29/2018 once they realize their error. The director\nreported the error was immediately communicated to the father of the child and\nthe foster parents.\nThe director reported an email and telephone call was made to the AG and Gal\non the child’s case explaining the error on how it was addressed and rectified.\nShe said all parties were understanding.
