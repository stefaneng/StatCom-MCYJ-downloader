Supervisor 1 is a staff member at the\nfacility. On 3/1/23 @ 8pm law enforcement was called to the\nfacility for a physical altercation between Youth A and Youth B.\nThere is an on-going concern that Youth B has been touching\nYouth A's butt and watching him shower. Supervisor 1 reported\nthis was the first that he'd ever heard this. But this was\ndocumented earlier in the day to a therapist. Youth B was\nremoved from being in the same building as Youth A.\nThe complainant did not return my phone call or email. Youth A\nand Youth B’s workers were notified and had no further\ninformation to add.\nI interviewed Youth A on 3/6/23 at the facility.

He\nreported he met with Youth A on 3/2/23, the morning after Youth A\nreported he was being touched by Youth B. Youth A told the\nClinical Director he was upset that Youth B touched his butt and\nprivate parts.

He reported he\nhas worked at the facility since December and did the same work\nat another facility for 30 years. Supervisor 1 reported that Youth A\nand B had words that evening, and Youth B got into a fight with\nYouth D. Supervisor 1 reported the police were called to restore\nthe calm. He reported while the police were at the cottage Youth\nA threw Youth B's flops at him after being asked to return them.\nThe officer raised his voice after seeing this and questioned Youth\nA about his actions. Supervisor 1 reported that Youth A began to\ncry, and that Youth A is often good at stirring things up but not\nhaving to answer to his behaviors. Supervisor 1 was not sure if the\nofficer intimidated Youth A resulting in his crying. Supervisor 1\nreported Youth A was crying and told the officer that Youth B\nwalked in on him in the restroom, and he was doing \"sexy acting\nout\". Supervisor 1 reported this a term he used and he believes\nthat Youth A picked up the language but it meant he was coming\n6",
    "in to look at him. Supervisor 1 reported they separated the boys\nthat evening in different cottages for the safety of everyone.\nSupervisor 1 reported he has never seen or heard that Youths A\nor B touched other youth sexually or on their private parts.\nSupervisor 1 reported the youth have 3 separate shower stalls\nwith individual doors. Supervisor 1 reported a staff member is\nalways outside the bathroom shower area when a youth is\nshowering.\nDocuments reviewed:\nIncident report was reviewed from 3/1/23 authored by Supervisor\n1. Report was consistent with Supervisor 1 interview.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews there is no evidence that supports Youth A\nwas touched on his butt or penis by Youth B or that he was\nwatched in the shower. All staff and youth deny that Youth B was\nwatching Youth A in the shower, and Youth A clarified that Youth\nB walked in but left when Youth A told him to leave. Youth A\nfurther said he did not feel that Youth B walking in was sexual or\nthat he was attempting to watch him or touch him. Youth A reports\nhe was touched by Youth B accidently on the butt on 3/1/23 and\nYouth B apologized. He reports after apologizing Youth B touched\nhim over his pants on his penis and this was reported to have\noccurred while the two were horse playing. All staff and youth\ninterviewed denied seeing Youth B touch Youth A on the butt and\npenis. Youth B denied touching Youth A on his butt or penis.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nHorseplay and wrestling should not be permitted in the cottages\nas the youth escalate and it leads to further behavioral issues.\nHaving youth that are younger and older mixed in a cottage\nshould be done cautiously. The youth have different abilities,\ncapabilities and interests and this can lead to behavioral issues\nbetween the youth.\nViolation Not Established\n7",
