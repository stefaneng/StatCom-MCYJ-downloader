One of the citations found during this year’s inspection\nwas a repeat from the 2023 renewal (FOM 722-06B FTM). Two of the citations\nfound during this year’s inspection were repeats from the past two inspections (R\n400.12418 Development of service plan and FOM 722-08D Treatment plans).\nDuring this period under review the agency noted that overall compliance was\nimpacted by a few staff who have struggled to adhere to the checklist protocol.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment reported the agency experienced minimal difficulty in meeting\nrequirements during this review period. The Chief Administrator (CA) stated the\nprevious year’s CAP has been effective for the majority. There have been a few\nstaff members who struggled adhering to the checklist protocol. In addition, the\n5",
    "agency has experienced some barriers due to difficult cases and a lack of\nappropriate placements and services for high needs youth.\nThe CA indicated the process of developing the CAP together with staff and\nutilizing the checklist has been very effective. The agency has also implemented\npeer auditing which has shown to be helpful in achieving overall compliance. The\nChief Administrator expressed confidence that there will be continued\nimprovement over the next review period.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported supervisors\nmeet with them regularly and coworkers are available as needed if issues arise.\nStaff reported feeling supported by the agency and had no concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. Records are stored securely.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Agency Analyst identified the following safety concerns:\nSafety Alert #1: Unlicensed relative caregiver home has a pool with no safety\nmeasures in place. In addition, the home has a strong smell of cigarette smoke.\nResolution: Agency completed a home visit and verified the unlicensed relative\nhome has life jackets, door alarm and a fence around the pool with a lock. A safety\nplan was signed by relative caregivers agreeing they will not smoke when foster\nyouth is present.\n6",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n______3/19/2024____________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n03/22/2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n7"
