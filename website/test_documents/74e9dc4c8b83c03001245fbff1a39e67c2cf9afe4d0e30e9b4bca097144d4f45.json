Youth A sustained a red mark on his face for an\nhour due to this. DART workers are not supposed to grab the\nchildren by their harnesses. Bus surveillance footage from the day\nin question was reviewed on 5-24-23. Before Youth A gets on to\nthe bus, he is laying on his back on the sidewalk refusing to get\non. One of the workers, a black male, grabs Youth A by his\nharness and yanks him up onto his feet. It is unknown if Youth A\nwas injured from this but appears to be okay from the video.\nInvestigation Several attempts were made to contact and interview the\ncomplainant. There was never a response to phone calls or\nemails, however; the MDHHS worker was able to contact the\nComplainant and a narrative is below in the Documents Reviewed\nsection of this report.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via phone, on 5/25/2023.\nHe reported being informed of the first allegation that the school\nbus staff picked up Youth A by his harness and left marks around\nhis neck. He also reported Law Enforcement observed the video\nrecording and identified a DART staff help Youth A up by his\nharness resulting in a second complaint being made. Youth A is\n2",
    "not able to be interviewed because of his limited verbal skills and\nlow functioning level.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility, on\n5/25/2023. She reported being made aware of the incident and\nreported the facility called in the complaint a month ago. At that\ntime, the allegations involved the school bus staff picking up Youth\nA by his harness and swinging him around, leaving a mark on his\nneck. She reported speaking to different staff to find out what had\nhappened. Administrator 1 has no issues with Staff 1, and he has\nno disciplinary action in his HR file.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility, on\n5/25/2023. He provided a tour of the location of the incident. He\nreported observing the video and stated the facility does not have\na policy that staff cannot grab the harness of a youth. He also\nreported it is understood verbally that staff should not grab the\nharness of a youth and certainly not use the harness to direct or\nguide the youth. Staff 1 informed him of what occurred and his\nrole in the situation. Administrator 2 reported Youth A has a\nhistory of aggression and self-harming behaviors.\nYouth A was observed at the facility on 5/25/2023. He was\nengaged with the staff supervising him but was nonverbal. He was\nhighly active and the interactions with staff were appropriate.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone, on 5/26/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported being present\nduring the incident and shared how the bus staff grabbed Youth A\nby the harness and swung him up into the bus. She also reported\nthe bus staff were rough with Youth A causing a red mark on his\nneck. She believed Youth A dropped to the ground because he\nwas refusing to get on the bus. She was unable to recall how\nYouth A got up from the ground and reported not seeing anything\ninappropriate with the interaction between Staff 1 and Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported staff cannot lift a youth up from the ground by the\nharness and if she saw such action, she would report it to\nadministration. She views Youth A as being resistant when not\nwanting to do something.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone, on 5/26/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported being present\nat the bus stop when the incident occurred. She reported Youth A\nsat on the ground because he did not want to get on the bus. All\nthe staff helped him up and she had her hands under Youth A’s\narm and on his back during this process. She gave a similar report\n3",
    "to the actions by the bus driver and aid, reported they “yanked”\nYouth A to get him on the bus and around the corner to a seat.\nShe never observed Staff 1 grab Youth A by the harness and\nbring him to his feet and if she did observe staff taking this type of\naction, she would report to her direct supervisor.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone, on 5/26/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported walking towards\nthe bus with Youth A before Youth A became upset and fell to the\nground. He also reported helping Youth A up by grabbing the\nshoulder straps of his harness and Youth A’s feet never left the\nground during the incident of helping him up. He wanted to get\nYouth A up as quickly as he could because Staff 1 feared Youth A\nwould incur an injury because he tends to injury himself if left on\nthe ground. The first time Youth A went to the ground he reached\nout his hand for Staff 1 to help him up but did not do so the\nsecond time, so Staff 1 grabbed his harness straps. Staff 1\nbelieved he did nothing wrong because he was only trying to help\nYouth A up but he believed policy states not to grab the harness.\nHe reported taking full responsibility for his actions and never had\nany intent to harm or hurt Youth A. He also gave the same report\nabout the actions of the bus staff when they grabbed Youth A by\nthe harness and roughly placed him on the bus. Staff 1 reported\nremoving Youth A from the bus after witnessing the actions by the\nbus staff because he feared for Youth A’s safety.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone, on 6/1/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She observed the bus staff\ngrabbing Youth A by the harness and moving him in the bus,\nhowever; she denied observing Staff 1 help Youth A up by\ngrabbing him by the straps on his harness. She believed staff are\nnot to grab the harness to move the youth and if she witnessed\nthis, she would inform the staff then administration. She reported\nYouth A will generally get up from the ground with a few verbal\nprompts after a period. She stated, “you need to offer your hand\nand if he is willing, he will take your hands.”\nDocuments Reviewed:\nHandle with Care Behavior Management System Manual for\nParticipants dated 2012. Nothing in this manual about helping a\nyouth up from the ground.\nDevelopmental Adolescent Residential Treatment – Resident\nRestraint, Emergency Restraint dated 3/16/23. This document\nstates the following. In the event an Emergency Physical\n4",
    "Intervention is necessary, it must be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the youth’s\nbehavior, chronological and developmental age, size, gender,\nphysical condition, medical condition, psychiatric condition, and\npersonal history, including any history of trauma, and must be\ndone in a manner consistent with the youth’s treatment plan. The\nprocedure for Crisis Prevention and Resolution and use of\nEmergency Physical Intervention outlines that the DART Manager\nand/or DART Clinician will immediately be notified when a youth is\nhaving increased difficulty managing their emotions or experience\na challenging issue.\nDevelopmental Adolescent Residential Treatment – Behavior\nManagement dated 2/18/21.

This report documents Youth A as the victim of\nattempted Assault & Battery/simple assault. After reviewing the\nvideo recording of the incident, Law Enforcement observed Youth\nA walking towards the bus before sitting down on the lawn. Staff 1\nhelped Youth A back up by taking the hand Youth A held out. A\nfew seconds later, Youth A again sat down and appeared to be\nrefusing to stand up. The workers standing around Youth A\nappear to be talking to him before Staff 1 is observed bending\ndown, grabbing the harness by the shoulder straps, and lifting\nYouth A up. Youth A’s feet do not leave the ground and Youth A\nwalks to the bus with Staff 1 next to him. Staff 2 was interviewed\nby Law Enforcement and gave the same accounting as she\nreported during this investigation.\nMDHHS workers interview with Complainant on 5/26/23. Face\nto face contact was made with Complainant at the Kentwood\nPolice Department. The intake was called in to CI because when\nshe reviewed the bus video after getting a warrant for it, she\nobserved a DART employee doing the same thing the driver and\ndriver aide did, as the employee was seen grabbing Youth A by\nhis harness prior to getting on the bus, so she called it in. She\ndoes not believe anything malicious occurred. She does not\nbelieve the employees actions to be abuse or neglect but called it\nin anyway. She does not believe the actions of the employee are\ncriminal in nature and stated Youth A was not injured as a result of\nthe incident. It was reported to her Youth A had a red mark on his\n5",
    "face for about an hour or so after, but there are no pictures of the\nred mark.\nHuman Resources file for Staff 1 was reviewed. Staff 1 has\nbeen employed at the facility for the past 6 years has no\ndocumented disciplinary action in his HR file. He is current on his\ntrainings.

His ability to conduct his ADLs are listed. A behavior\nsupport plan is part of this document and lists the target behaviors\nfor Youth A which are listed as skin picking, physical aggression,\ndisrobing, and property destruction. Several preventative\nstrategies are listed which include keeping him busy and engaged,\nredirecting, providing choices, and encouraging him to play with\nsensory stimulating toys. If Youth A is engaging in minor disruptive\nbehavior, staff are to redirect him “to a task which is incompatible\nwith the behavior we want him to stop doing”. Reinforcement and\nreactive strategies are listed and when Youth A engages in\ndisruptive behavior (falling to floor, crying, yelling, physical\naggression) after a request is made of him, staff should engage in\nthe following behaviors.\n• Maintain a neutral facial expression and tone of voice. Wait\nuntil disruptive behavior has ended, then repeat the\nrequest.\n• If he requires assistance in completing the request, prompt\nhim to functionally request help.\n• Repeat the steps as needed.\n• Provide praise for any positive behavior.\nYouth A individual safety & calming plan dated 10/24/22. This\ndocument outlines Youth A’s triggers, counterproductive strategies\nnot to use (force him to complete a task), precursors to aggression\n& self-injurious behavior, calming strategies & coping skills, pro-\nactive strategies, crisis intervention strategies, elopement\nprevention, and emergency safety/last resort. This document is\nsigned by his clinical manager.\nIncident/accident report dated 4/28/2023. This document was\nthe original incident in which the bus staff were identified as\ngrabbing and yanking Youth A by his harness. Witnesses to this\naction were identified as Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4. There\nis no mention of Staff 1 picking Youth A by his harness.\n6",
    "Updated Service Plan for Youth A dated 4/7/23 by Foster Care\nWorker. This document indicates Youth A is on 1:1 supervision\nbecause of the presenting problems. There is no time frame for a\nreduction in this supervision and because of his limitations his stay\nat the facility has no ending date currently.\nTreatment Plan Periodic Review for Youth A dated 4/10/23.\nThis document outlines Youth A continues to require maximal\nprompts to engage in therapist directed activities. He requires\nmaximal prompts to wait with eating and struggles to chew and\nswallow before taking another bite of food. Youth A is not meeting\nhis goal for disrobing, physical aggression, and skin picking. In\nsummary, Youth A continues to exhibit behaviors that require\nconstant supervision and support. He has made some\nimprovement in his engagement with the treatment team but will\nreturn to behaviors that require constant redirection. Youth\nreceived individual therapy sessions and engaged in weekly\ntherapy during this period.\nVideo Review\nThe camera angle is from the back of the bus looking forward and\nto the right. Within this view, Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Youth A\ncan be observed. Staff 1 and Youth A are walking towards the bus\nwhen Youth A falls to the ground. Staff 1 appears to be talking to\nYouth A and Youth A puts out his hand which Staff 1 grabs and\nhelps him to his feet. A few moments later Youth A again falls to\nthe ground. Staff 1 and other staff appear to be talking to Youth A\nbefore Staff 1 grabs Youth A’s harness by the shoulder straps and\nhelps him to his feet. There is no jerking or any other inappropriate\naction in this move by Staff 1. Youth A’s feet never leave the\nground. Youth A and Staff 1 then walk to the bus door.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews, written documentation, and video\nrecordings evidence supports Staff 1 did not follow Youth A’s\nsafety & calming plan. When Staff 1 brought Youth A to his feet by\nholding his harness straps, he was forcing Youth A to complete a\ntask when the plan is not to force Youth A to complete a task.\nStaff 1’s actions also did not allow Youth A to develop improved\nproblem-solving skills.\nTECHNICAL ASSITANCE:\nIt was recommended the facility address the issue of staff not\nacknowledging the action even though they were standing next to\nStaff 1 and Youth A. It was recommended to the facility they\naddress the use of a harness in their policies and procedures.\nConclusion Violation Established\n7",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n6/13/2023\n______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 14, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
