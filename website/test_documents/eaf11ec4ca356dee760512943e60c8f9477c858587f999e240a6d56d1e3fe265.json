EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows.\nCAP approved 9/28/22, was the result of the 9/16/22 renewal inspection. The\nagency is in compliance with the CAP as no repeat violations were found.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed. The Chief\nAdministrator (CA) reported successful implementation of the 2022 CAP.\nHowever, the agency still faces some ongoing challenges including difficulty\ngetting parents to engage, obtaining documentation from medical providers,\nstaffing changes, and the state-wide placement crisis. The CA noted that\nescalating mental health needs of children has continued to make placements\nchallenging as there are not enough appropriate providers.\nThe CA reported the agency continues to work hard in efforts to overcome these\nchallenges. Efforts include frequent communication with staff, monthly CAP\nmeetings, and ongoing quality assurance practices.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed onsite.
