The bedroom designated for the foster children did not have doors.\nSolution:\nDoors were placed on the rooms effective 3/2122 and pictures are attached to\ndemonstrate this.\nConcern:\n2. The relative has a bedroom in her basement that doesn't have a means of\negress.\nSolution:\nThe relative agreed to not allow any children in the basement when the adult\nbedroom is in the basement. There is no room upstairs for the relative to\nreside. The room is near the stairs for exit. The relative has been referred to\nlicensure to see if this can be addressed through the FIG grant.\nVIII.
