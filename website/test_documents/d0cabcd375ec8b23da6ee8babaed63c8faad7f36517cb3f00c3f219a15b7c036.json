    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nSection The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 5/6 or 5/7, Youth S chose to nap in his room and was\nassaulted by an unidentified youth who left bruises and scratches\non his face. Staff were not aware this happened so did not\nintervene.\nInvestigation On 5/10/23, I interviewed Complainant, who is also the\nCommunity Management Organization (CMO) Worker. She said\nshe visited Youth S on 5/9/23 and saw scratches and yellowish\nbruises under his eyes. Youth S told Complainant that Youth 2,\nwho he refused to identify, hit him in his bedroom on 5/6/23 or\n5/7/23 (weekend) while Staff 1 was supposed to be supervising\nthe youths. Youth S did not tell anyone this happened until 5/9/23.\nComplainant questioned the level of supervision at the facility but\nhad no additional concerns.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI collaborated with Government Worker 1 via phone. She said an\non-call government worker completed a well-being check on\nYouth S on 5/9/23 and forwarded a photo of his injuries taken the\nsame date. The photo shows yellowish-brown bruising and\npatchy redness under his right eye and a purple mark under his\nleft eye.\nI notified Chief Administrator (CA) of the investigation via email\nand Director of the allegation via phone. Director said she would\nmove Youth S to another pod for his safety, have him examined\nby the nurse and review video footage of dayshift on 5/6/23 when\nthe identified staff worked. After reviewing the video, Director said\nnothing shows one or two youths entering or exiting Youth S’s\nroom. However, she said there was video of Youth S\nhorseplaying with other youths.\nI interviewed Youth S at the facility on 5/10/23. He is not a reliable\nwitness as he told various adults different accounts of what\n2",
    "happened. After the facility became aware of the allegation,\nYouth S said he was moved to another pod and “feels better.” He\nsaid the incident happened inside his room on Pod E between\nlunch and dinner while Staff 1 and 3 were working. He thought it\nhappened on 5/6/23 or 5/7/23 but he was “not 100% sure.”\nBefore the incident, Youth S said the youths were in the general\narea playing games while he sat alone on the outskirts. Youth 1,\nwho he refused to identify, accused Youth S of calling him a\n“bitch.” “I went to my room to excuse myself.” Youth 3 asked\nYouth S to bring a deck of cards out from his room. Youth S got\nthe cards and as he turned to exit his room, he said Youth 2, who\nhe also refused to identify, was in his room and punched him once\nin each eye with his fist. “I swung back, hit his chest, and\nslammed him onto the floor.” Youth 3, who he refused to identify\nas well, came inside Youth S’ room and “broke it up.” “Youth 3\ngrabbed me off of Youth 2 and then walked Youth 2 out of my\nroom.” Youth S said he was seen by a nurse for his injuries on\n5/9/23 and did not require any medical treatment.\nI asked if Youth S was horseplaying with the other youths as seen\non video by Director. He said he did not recall horseplaying but\nadmitted he “plays” with Youth M and C. Youth S said Youths M\nand C were not involved in this incident. I asked Youth S where\nStaff 1 and 3 were when this incident occurred. He guessed Staff\n1 was in the control room and Staff 3 was on a bathroom break.\nTo avoid being called a “snitch” and getting “jumped” again, Youth\nS said he did not tell Staff 1, 3 or any other staff that this\nhappened. I asked Youth S if bedroom doors are supposed to be\nlocked when youths are outside of their rooms. He said “Yes, but\nsometimes they aren’t.”\nDirector said there is no policy at the facility that room doors must\nbe locked when youth are outside their rooms. However, Director,\nStaff 1 and Staff 3 agreed it is best practice that the doors are\nlocked at all times.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1. She has\nonly worked at the facility for two months. Staff 1 said she saw\nYouth S on 5/6/23 and did not observe any injuries on his face.\nShe denied seeing another youth go into Youth S’s room but\nacknowledged the other youths “pick on” him. “They smack each\nother on the backs of their necks (referred to as cheese-neck) so I\npay close attention to Youth S.” Staff 1 said there are always at\nleast two staff supervising the youths in the general area when\nthey are out of their rooms. “One of us can go briefly to the staff\n3",
    "office. Staff bathroom breaks require another staff to cover in their\nabsence.”\nI asked Staff 1 if the bedroom doors are supposed to be locked\nwhen youths are outside their rooms. She stated their doors are\nsupposed to be locked, but “residents use the rules against us.”\nStaff 1 explained that youths will ask staff to unlock their doors to\nuse the bathroom. Multiple youths ask consecutively knowing it is\ndifficult for the staff to track each youth’s whereabouts and assure\ntheir doors are locked when they exit. She said youths also warn\nstaff they will get “in trouble” if staff deny them use of their\nbathroom. This manipulation tactic set up by the youths results in\nunlocked doors where one or more youths can slip out of line of\nsight of the staff as well as the cameras.\nGiven Youth S’ inability and/or unwillingness to provide accurate\ninformation, Government Worker 1 and I were unable to determine\nwho, where, when or how Youth S got two black eyes. The fact\nhis injuries were nearly healed by 5/8/23 suggests they may have\nhappened in one of many previously documented altercations he\nhad with other youths. Nonetheless Government Worker 1 and I\nreviewed video footage of Pod E between lunch and dinner on\n5/6/23.\nVideo cameras at Lincoln Center do not have audio capabilities.\nVideo shows several youths sitting in a wide circle on Pod E with\nStaff 2 and 3 supervising the group. During the two-hour period\nreviewed, a number of youths are seen walking up to or behind\nYouth S throwing “stress balls” at him that hit him on various parts\nof his body. One youth touches Youth S’s hair and rubs his head.\nOther youths smack him on the back of his neck while Youth S\ncovers his head and remains seated in his chair. One youth\napproaches Youth S and swings at his face. Neither Staff 2 nor 3\nphysically intervene. It is unknown if the staff intervened verbally\nor issued misconduct write-ups to any youths for these behaviors.\nAt the end of the period, Youth J is seen moving toward his own\nroom. Youth S moves in the same direction and a crowd of\nyouth’s gather outside the room. Staff 2 arrives at the room within\nseconds and the youths disperse. It could not be determined\nwhether Youth J and S were inside or outside of the room given\nthe camera angle.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has\nworked at the facility for two months. Staff 2 said the youths “like\nto pick on Youth S. I made it clear I’d write them up for assaulting\na peer.” Staff 2 was asked about the point in the video where\n4",
    "youths were gathered outside a room and Staff 2 intervened. He\nrecalled, “One kid asked me to get something from the control\nroom.” Looking back on this, Staff 2 felt this request was an\nintentional manipulation to distract his attention away from the\nyouths on the pod. “Lots of kids standing around (a room) drew\nme there. I saw Youth S and J inside the room. I got them out.\nThat’s why it’s important we keep all the room door closed.” Staff\n2 denied seeing Youth S and J fighting.\nI asked Staff 2 about the head-smacking and ball throwing on the\npod. He referred to this behavior as “horseplay” and said it is not\nallowed but appeared somewhat helpless to prevent it.\nI interviewed Staff 3 jointly with Government Worker 1 via phone\non 6/1/23. When the incident occurred, he had only worked at the\nfacility for three weeks. Around 5/4/23, Staff 3 recalled he went\ninto a closet to get a mop. When he came out, he saw Youth S\nexiting Youth C’s room and observed Youth S’s face was red.\nI asked Staff 3 why Youth C’s room was unlocked. He said he did\nnot know but “youths find ways to pop the locks using UNO\ncards.” Staff 3 denied ever seeing a youth “pop” a lock. He\nbelieves the facility has a policy that bedroom doors must remain\nlocked when youth are outside of their rooms. Staff 3 checks that\ndoors are locked all day every day, but said all staff are not as\nvigilant as he is. Staff 3 further explained that a red light above\nthe room door is supposed to signal when a door is unlocked but\nsome of the lights show red when the door is locked rendering the\nsystem unreliable. He said he has reported the light malfunction\nto management.\nStaff 3 added that he is frequently mandated to work up to six\nhours beyond the end of his regular shift. He said no staff\nmembers want to work on Pod E because it seems youth with the\nunruliest behaviors are placed there.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\n5",
    "Analysis Staff 3 saw Youths S and C coming out of a bedroom on 5/4/23\nand Staff 2 saw Youths S and J coming out of a bedroom on\n5/6/23. Unlocked room doors interfere with staff’s ability to\nmaintain line-of-sight of the youths resulting in supervision/safety\nissues in secure juvenile detention and treatment facilities.\nCONSULTATION\nI provided literature to leaders at the facility on the benefits of\ncreating a positive peer culture throughout the facility. Strategies\nfor handling pods with particularly difficult youth should be\ndeveloped with increased supervisory and clinical staff presence\nand support provided.\nFacility leaders should regularly monitor whether or not red lights\nabove the doors function properly, determine if any youth are\nactually able to “pop” their locks, and make door/lock repairs\naccordingly.\nA written supervision policy/procedure should be developed\nrequiring all bedroom doors are locked when youth are inside or\noutside of their rooms.\nI provided consultation on one way that staff can assure all doors\nremain locked when youth are outside of their rooms, which is\nlabor-intensive. Staff should first remind youths to use the\nbathroom prior to exiting their rooms for the next activity. Youth\nshould exit their rooms one at a time with staff checking that each\ndoor locks behind him. Youth should only be allowed to use their\nroom toilets one at a time, staff should unlock the door and assure\nit locks behind him after each entrance and exit. This may require\nstaff remaining at the door as youth enters and exits.\nStaff need to remain alert to the various tactics youths use to\nmanipulate and control their environment. Needs should only be\nmet for one youth one at a time. When one staff is meeting a\nneed, the other staff must be supervising the other youths.\nForming lines arm-distance apart during transport, counting off in\nline and standing at ease next to bedroom doors until released to\nmove by staff are other ways to add structure to the milieu.\nEssential rules/codes of conduct could be posted on each pod to\nremind youth of prohibited behaviors such as no touching other\nyouths, no head-smacking, no horseplay, no bullying, no name-\ncalling, and no entering a room without staff awareness and\npermission.\n6",
    "To specifically discourage horseplay and bullying, staff should\nphysically move to the area where the horseplay is occurring and\nprovide continuous verbal redirection and protection to any youth\nbeing bullied. Staff may suggest the bullied youth voluntarily rest\nsafely in his room. If a youth requests to voluntarily be locked in\nhis room for safety reasons during free time, that is not considered\nseclusion. However, staff must complete eye-on checks of that\nyouth at variable intervals at least every fifteen minutes and the\nchecks must be documented. Youth must also be allowed out of\ntheir room when they ask.\nFinally, staff should write an unusual incident report upon\ndiscovering two or more youths in a room without staff supervision\nor permission.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2021C0103027 intake 6/21/21; CAP approved 10/26/21\n2023C0000424 intake 4/25/23; CAP pending\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJune 7, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 7, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
