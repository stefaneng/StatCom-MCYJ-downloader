FCW reported she was on\nher way to see Youth A at the facility when she received a call\nfrom Case Manager regarding Youth A being involved with an\nincident involving a nicotine vape pen and a marijuana vape pen.\nFCW reported they were suspicious he used the vapes, so they\nasked permission for him to get drug tested. When she arrived at\nthe facility, FCW met with Therapist, Case Manager and Youth A\nregarding the incident. Youth A disclosed he watched another\nyouth in the program take vapes out of a staff member’s purse.\nFCW reported she did not know the names of the other youth or\nthe staff member. Youth A reported he did not use either of the\nvapes and did not take either of the vapes. FCW reported she was\nconcerned about supervision by staff and how vapes were\naccessible to youth.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 11/17/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. CA\nnoted they became aware the vapes were taken on Wednesday\n11/15/23, and Program Manager began a full investigation as to\nwhere the vapes came from and how youth accessed them. CA\nreported initially they knew the vapes were taken somewhere\nbetween Monday 11/13/23 and Wednesday 11/15/23. CA reported\nthrough the investigation, they learned Staff 2 had the vapes in\nher purse on Tuesday 11/14/23. CA reported Staff 2 is coming in\ntoday (11/17/23) to be terminated as they are a substance free\ncampus.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed via phone on\n11/17/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. PM reported she\n2",
    "wasn’t present for the initial incident, but she handled the follow-\nup investigation. Through her investigation, she found out the\nincident occurred on Tuesday evening 11/14/23. On Wednesday\n11/15/23, she followed up with Staff 1 because he was the shift\nsupervisor on Tuesday night. At the time she spoke to Staff 1,\nthey only knew perfume was taken from Staff 2’s purse. Later\nWednesday morning, Youth B disclosed he stole vapes from Staff\n2’s purse, kept one of the vapes and gave the other to Youth C.\nYouth B gave staff members the vape he had. Youth C reported\nthe vape he was given was in a hygiene basket, which was\nconfirmed and confiscated by staff. PM decided room searches\nneeded to occur to ensure there was no other contraband.\nNothing was found in Youth A or Youth B’s rooms. In Youth C’s\nroom, they found another vape as well as an extended drill bit. It is\nunknown where Youth C obtained the vape found in his room. PM\nreported Case Manager and the nursing department handled\ngetting drug screens for Youth A, Youth B and Youth C. PM\nreported she followed up with Supervisor 1 regarding what was\nlearned, and Supervisor 1 called Staff 2. Staff 2 didn’t offer\ninformation to Supervisor 1 about the vapes until Supervisor 1\nspecifically asked her about them.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n11/17/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported\nhe was sitting in the milieu when Staff 1 went into the medication\nroom in the staff office. Youth A reported Youth B went into the\nstaff office and stole 2 vapes out of a staff member’s purse, but he\ndidn’t know the staff member’s name. Youth A reported he didn’t\nknow what happened to the vapes after Youth B took them. Youth\nA reported he thinks Youth B tried the vapes because he could\nsmell something weird in the milieu, but he didn’t see Youth B try\nthem.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n11/28/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported\none of the staff members from Boelkins guest staffed on\nZondervaan, but he couldn’t remember her name. Youth B\nreported her purse was in the staff office. Youth B reported Staff 1\nwent into the medication room and left the staff office open. Youth\nB reported he was out in the milieu with Youth A, but he saw the\nstaff office open, so he went and sat in the staff chair. Youth B\nreported he saw the staff member’s purse, went through it and\ntook vapes and a bottle of perfume. Youth B reported he couldn’t\nremember how many vapes he took, but thinks it was probably 2-\n4. Youth B reported at least one of the vape was a marijuana\nvape. Youth B reported after he took the items, he went to the\n3",
    "milieu to sit with Youth A. Youth B reported Staff 1 came out of the\nmedication room and gave them their medications, and then\nYouth B went into the bathroom to take a shower. Youth B\nreported a little later, everyone else came back to the unit. Youth\nB reported when the guest staff came back and went through her\npurse, she came out of the office. Youth B reported Staff 1 came\nto talk to him and asked him if he took anything out of the staff\noffice. Youth B reported he told Staff 1 he didn’t go in the staff\noffice. Youth B reported Staff 1 did not specifically ask him if he\ntook vapes, so he didn’t think Staff 1 knew. Youth B reported later\nin the night, Staff 1, Staff 3, Staff 4, and the guest staff talked to\nhim and Youth A about whether they went into the staff office and\ntook anything, but they didn’t do any searches or ask specifically\nabout the vapes. Youth B reported they went to bed. Youth B\nreported he smoked the vapes while they were in his possession,\nand he gave one to Youth C. Youth B reported the next morning\nhe was talking to Education Specialist and asked her for some of\nher Oreos. Youth B reported Education Specialist said, “I’m not\ngoing to give you any, knowing you stole from someone”. Youth B\nreported Education Specialist told him they saw him on camera\ntaking stuff. Youth B reported he thought there was a blind spot\nbut wasn’t surprised they caught him on camera. Youth B reported\nhe admitted what happened, gave Education Specialist the vape\nhe hid in the bathroom and told her Youth C had the other vape.\nYouth B reported no one asked him about the vapes specifically\nuntil after he admitted what he took.\nAn attempt was made to interview Youth C face to face on\n11/28/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker, but Youth C\nrefused to talk.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 11/28/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported he was\nworking as the shift supervisor for Zondervaan on 11/14/23. Staff\n1 reported they were short staffed, so Staff 2 picked up a shift to\nhelp them out. Staff 1 reported there were three youth on the unit\nwith him (Youth A, Youth B and Youth D) while all other youth and\nstaff were on other parts of the campus. Staff 1 reported Youth D\nwas in the shower while Youth A and Youth B were in the milieu\nwith him. Staff 1 reported Youth B stated he was going to take a\nshower, so Staff 1 unlocked the bathroom for him. Staff 1 reported\nhe went through the staff office into the medication room to get a\ncough drop, and Youth A was still in the milieu. Staff 1 reported\ngenerally the staff office is closed, so youth can’t access it, but\nbecause he was the only staff member on shift, he left it open so\nhe could hear what was going on in the milieu since Youth A was\n4",
    "still out there. Staff 1 reported when he came out of the staff\noffice, Youth B was in the milieu and stated he wasn’t in the\nshower yet because he needed a towel. When Staff 2 returned to\nthe unit from the activity with other youth, she told Staff 1 there\nwas perfume missing from her purse. Staff 2 never disclosed there\nwere vapes also missing from her purse. Staff 1 reported he\nasked Youth A and Youth B about the missing perfume, but they\nboth denied going into the staff office. Staff 1 reported Youth E\nwent to use the bathroom and came out stating there was broken\nglass on the floor in the bathroom and there was a piece of glass\nin his sandal. Staff 1 reported he and Staff 2 went to the\nbathroom, saw the broken glass, and smelled perfume. Staff 1\nreported it was the same bathroom Youth B had used to take a\nshower, so he was positive Youth B had stolen the perfume.\nWhen Staff 1 asked Youth B about it again, Youth B continued to\ndeny he took anything. The next morning, Staff 1 reported\nEducation Specialist pulled Youth B out of class and asked him\nsome questions. Youth B came onto the unit, grabbed the vape he\nhid in the vent in the bathroom and gave it to Education Specialist.\nYouth B also told Education Specialist he gave the other vape to\nYouth C. Staff 1 reported they were able to confiscate the vape\nfrom Youth C and they also found another vape in Youth C’s room\nwhen doing room searches.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 12/6/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported she worked on 11/14/23.\nStaff 2 reported she went with one youth to kid’s club for an hour,\nand then came back onto the unit. Staff 2 reported her purse was\nin the staff office and she thought the staff office was locked, but it\nwasn’t. Staff 2 reported she looked in her purse and found 2\nvapes (1 nicotine and 1 marijuana) and her perfume were missing.\nStaff 2 reported she found out her insurance card was missing but\ndidn’t notice that until after she was terminated from employment.\nShe reported after she found out things were missing, she told\nStaff 1 the perfume was missing from her purse. Staff 2 reported\nshe couldn’t remember if she told Staff 1 vapes were missing.\nStaff 2 reported she questioned whether vapes were missing from\nher purse because she had never brought them on campus\nbefore. She reported she didn’t confirm they were missing until\nafter she got home that night. Staff 2 reported she and Staff 1\nwent to Youth A’s room and asked him if he knew about anything\nbeing taken from the staff office, and he said no. Staff 2 reported\nshe and Staff 1 went to Youth B’s room and asked the same\nquestion. Staff 2 reported Youth B said he had heard of other kids\ntaking staff’s belongings before but doesn’t know anything about\nwho or what they took. Staff 2 reported she and Staff 1 went back\n5",
    "to the staff office and not more than 30 seconds later, a different\nyouth (not sure of his name), came out of the bathroom and said\nhe stepped on broken glass in the bathroom. Staff 2 reported she\nand Staff 1 went into the bathroom and smelled perfume. Staff 1\nreported she was shaken up by the whole incident, so they\nallowed her to go home early. Staff 2 reported she got a call from\nSupervisor 1 the next day to talk about the situation and disclosed\nthe vapes were missing from her purse after Supervisor 1 asked\nher about them. Staff 2 reported she was terminated from\nemployment on 11/17/23, which was understandable given the\ncircumstances.\nEducation Specialist (ES) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 11/28/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. ES\nreported on 11/15/23, she was talking to Youth B and asked, “why\nare you getting in a staff’s purse?” and he replied “That’s what I\ndo. That’s what I’m here for. I like to steal”. ES reported she told\nhim she heard he took perfume and Youth B said, “well what\nabout the other stuff?”. ES reported she was surprised because\nshe didn’t know he took anything else but decided to go along with\nit. ES reported she told Youth B “Yeah we saw on camera stealing\nthe other stuff and need that back too”. ES reported Youth B took\nher to Zondervaan and grabbed a vape out of the vent in the\nbathroom on the unit. Youth B told her the perfume bottle broke in\nthe bathroom and he flushed the pieces down the toilet. Youth B\nonly physically gave her one of the vapes, and said he gave the\nother vape to Youth C. ES reported she spoke to Youth C and he\nsaid “[Youth B] gave it to me, but I didn’t want it, so I put it in\n[Youth B]’s hygiene bin because I don’t like them”. ES reported\nshe looked in the hygiene bin and it wasn’t in there, but then she\npulled the bin out and found the vape behind the bin. ES reported\nYouth B and Youth C denied there were any other vapes, so she\ncompleted an incident report. ES reported she and Staff 1\nconducted room searches and found another vape in Youth C’s\nroom, but they weren’t sure if that one came from Staff 2’s purse\nor not.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n11/28/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 1\nreported she was off work on 11/15/23 but received a call from\nSupervisor 2 asking which staff worked on 11/14/23 because\nthere might have been some vapes taken. Supervisor 1 provided\nStaff 2’s name to Supervisor 2, and then contacted PM to ask\nwhat was going on. PM told Supervisor 1 they didn’t have a lot of\ndetails yet but would notify her when they did. As a preventative\nmeasure, Supervisor 1 called Staff 2 and offered her the night off\n6",
    "work since they were overstaffed. Later in the day, PM called\nSupervisor 1 and notified her a bottle of perfume and 2 vapes\nwere taken from Staff 2’s purse. Supervisor 1 called Staff 2 and\nasked her about the perfume taken the night before. Staff 2 told\nSupervisor 1 it was taken out of her purse, which was in the staff\noffice, and then it was found broken in the bathroom. Supervisor 1\nreported she asked Staff 2 if anything else was taken because\nStaff 2 did not offer the information. Supervisor 1 told Staff 2 she\nneeded to be honest because it was for the health, safety, and\nwelfare of the youth in the program. Staff 2 admitted 2 vapes were\ntaken from her purse as well; one nicotine vape, and one\nmarijuana vape. Supervisor 1 reported she told Staff 2 those were\nprohibited substances on a property. Staff 2 told Supervisor 1 she\ndidn’t know how to bring it up in conversation they were missing,\nbut profusely apologized. Supervisor 1 reported since Staff 2 was\nin her probationary period, Staff 2 was terminated from\nemployment on 11/17/23.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident Report dated 11/15/23 authored by ES states staff\nwere suspicious of contraband. [Youth B] admitted to\nhaving 2 vapes and gave them to staff.\n• Incident Report dated 11/15/23 authored by Staff 1 states\n[Youth C]’s room was searched because of drug\nparaphernalia suspicion and staff found a weed pen and a\ndrill bit.\n• Drug screen results for Youth A, Youth B and Youth C,\ntaken 11/15/23 and results received 11/20/23, noted none\nof them tested positive for marijuana.\n• Shift Summary dated 11/14/23 (PM) states guest staff [Staff\n2]’s perfume was stolen from her purse, and it wasn’t found\non any of the kids. Note stated [Youth B] was highly\nsuspected of taking it because the glass being on the\nbathroom floor after his shower and Staff 4 smelling\nperfume on his hands.\n• Shift Summary dated 11/15/23 (AM) states [Youth A]\nadmitted [Youth B] took the perfume. A room search was\nconducted for [Youth A], and nothing was found. [Youth C]\nwas confronted about a vape and told staff what he did with\nit. Staff retrieved the vape and asked about any other\nvapes, which he denied. Room search was done and a\n7",
    "vape was found in his room. A room search was done on\n[Youth B]’s room and nothing was found.\n• Wedgwood Christian Services Employee Handbook\nAddendum: Marijuana Use states Wedgwood is a drug-free\nworkplace, which prohibits employees from possessing\nmarijuana at work, using marijuana at work, or reporting to\nwork with a detectible level of marijuana in their system.\n• Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary records in his\nemployee file. Staff 1 received a team training on facility\npolicies on 8/24/23.\n• Staff 2 was terminated on 11/17/23 because of this incident\nviolating the Employee Handbook as well as the\nAlcohol/Prohibited Substances Policy. Included in her\ntermination memo dated 11/17/23, were two other write ups\nfor incidents unrelated to this investigation. There is a note\nin her employee file stating Staff 2 is ineligible for rehire.\nStaff 2 received training on policies during orientation and\nshadow shifts on 10/18/23, 10/24/23, 10/27/23, 10/28/23\nand 10/31/23.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is established. Staff 2 violated the facility’s employee\nhandbook regarding being a substance free campus, which\nincludes not possessing marijuana on campus. As a result of Staff\n2 bringing a marijuana vape and a nicotine vape on campus,\nyouth at the facility had access to these substances.\nTechnical Assistance:\n- All staff belongings should be secured in the staff closet\nroom, which is located behind a locked door inside the staff\noffice. Since the staff office may be open for staff to access\nthe medication room, this would eliminate the potential for\nyouth to access staffs’ belongings in the future.\n- If staff from units are covering shifts on other units, it is\nimperative they are aware of the expectations surrounding\nstorage of their belongings to ensure the safety of youth.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2023C0000256 dated 4/3/23; CAP approved 4/18/23\n8",
