Supervisor does not have a discipline history.\n5",
    "Program Manager completed Crisis Prevention Institute’s Non-\nviolent Physical Crisis Intervention training for trainers on\n02/19/2023, 02/21/2023, 02/22/2023 and 02/23/2023. Program\nManager’s training documentation states train the trainer\ncertification is good for two years. Program Manager does not\nhave discipline history related to physical management.\nCrisis Prevention Institute (CPI) training materials were reviewed\nand it was found that CPI does not teach a wrap-around hold that\ninvolves physically moving a youth with their feet on or off the\nground to another location. It also does not teach a one person\nhold that involves holding a youth’s hand and using one’s body to\nblock the youth from leaving a corner.\nTour\nThe administrative hallway leads to D-wing’s common area and\nseparated by a door. Upon entering the common area, C-wing is\nlocated to the left and separated by a door. Across from the\nadministrative wing door is D-wing’s door. The common area has\nthree couches with removable cushions.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance when Program Manager\nwrapped his arms around Youth A, picked her up and carried her\ndown the administrative hallway to the common area. Program\nManager also used his body as a barricade to keep Youth A in a\ncorner in the common area. These methods are not taught in\nCrisis Prevention Institute - Nonviolent Crisis Prevention\nIntervention.\nIt cannot be definitively determined how Youth A obtained the\nmark on her right knee.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nStaff must complete refresher training annually or more frequently\nas needed. A certified physical management trainer for Crisis\nPrevention Institute is valid for two years. The trainer is to attend a\nyearly training as a staff participant in the year they are not\nrecertified as a trainer.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRule Code R 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nTitle prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\n6",

(Please see CCI Rule 400.4159 (5) in this report\nfor interview information.)\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe result of not identifying and documenting Youth A’s physical\nmanagement on the incident report resulted in the agency’s failure\nto generate a MiSACWIS restraint report as required by\nR 400.4163 Health status assessment; notification; debriefing;\nreporting. (5) An agency will provide an incident report on a form\nprescribed by the department for each incident involving the use\nof seclusion or restraint.

Those responsible for\nreviewing and approving the incident report must seek clarification\nwhen needed and review for accuracy prior to approval of incident\nreport to ensure MiSACWIS documentation.\nThe result of not identifying Youth A’s physical management\nresulted in the agency’s failure for Youth A being assessed by\nhealth services following physical management as required by\nR 400.4163 Health status assessment; notification; debriefing;\nreporting. Rule 163. (2) Health status screening of the youth will\noccur immediately after seclusion or restraint by staff assigned to\nthis screening, as defined in agency policy.
