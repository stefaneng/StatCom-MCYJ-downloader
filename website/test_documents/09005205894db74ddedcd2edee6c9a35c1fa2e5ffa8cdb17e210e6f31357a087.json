The corrective\naction plan is currently pending.\nIn 2020, the Renewal Inspection found no licensing violations.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on their regular license.\nNovember 8, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 8, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n3"
