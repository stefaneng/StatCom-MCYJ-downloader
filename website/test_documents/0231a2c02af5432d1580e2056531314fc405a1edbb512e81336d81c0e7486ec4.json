DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nCCI Rule 400.4111 Job description\n(1) An institution shall provide a job description for\neach staff position that identifies rules, required\nqualifications, and lines of authority.\nOne of twenty new employee files did not have verification the employee received\ntheir job description.\n2",
    "CCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\n(1) An institution shall maintain employee records\nfor each employee and shall include\ndocumentation of all of the following information\nprior to employment or at the time specified in\nthis rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan\ndepartment of human services, the\nequivalent state or Canadian provincial\nagency, or equivalent agency in the\ncountry where the person usually resides,\nthat the person has not been determined\nto be a perpetrator of child abuse or child\nneglect. The documentation shall be\ncompleted not more than 30 days prior to\nthe start of employment and every 12\nmonths thereafter.\nTwo of twenty new employee files did not have a central registry clearance\ncompleted within 30 days prior to hire.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRenewal Inspection Report dated 3/27/24; CAP approved 4/25/24\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• For youth discharged from the program - a case transfer summary alone isn't\nsufficient. If they leave the program, there must be a discharge report.\n• Central Registry clearance checks not being completed within 30 days prior to\nhire has been a violation for the past 4 annual audits (including this one). This\nis a serious issue as it directly relates to the safety of the youth cared for by\nthe facility. This violation cannot happen again and there needs to be many\nlevels of oversight and signoffs to occur prior to anyone getting hired\n(especially if delaying a hire date).\n• The new hire checklist should say \"CANS checks within 30 days prior to hire\"\ninstead of \"within 30 days of hire\" to ensure clarity.\n• The facility must create and follow a uniform process for employee records to\nensure all the information required by licensing rules is in the employee's file,\nespecially at the time of the facility's annual audit. The electronic files\nprovided by HR were missing multiple documents. It doesn't matter if the HR\nfile come from the program directly or HR, but the file provided must include\nall required documents.\n• The facility did not provide an accurate employee list which caused 7 new\nemployee files not to be reviewed during the first round of reviews. It wasn't\n3",
    "until the Consultant asked further questions that the additional information\nwas provided. It is imperative the employee list provided during annual audits\nincludes names, position and hire dates for all employees during the period of\nreview. Any employees missed in the future will likely result in automatic\nviolations for licensing rules related to employee records.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Hire Date, Employee name and Supervisor name should be listed on the new\nhire checklist to verify the date of hire, which employee it's for and the hiring\nmanager signing off on the information.\n• Hire Dates on the staff audit lists provided to the Consultant need to be\ndouble-checked as there were two incorrect hire dates listed, which caused\nconfusion when verifying timeframes for hire documents.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The first\nCAP was a result of the facility's 2024 Renewal inspection assessment. The\nfacility had the following violations and addressed them in the following ways:\n- Rule 4113(1)(i) - The facility updated the new hire checklist to reflect the\ncentral registry check must be within 30 days prior to hire, completed\nupdated central registry checks for staff who didn't have them, created an\nall-staff spreadsheet where dates of annual background checks and\ntraining would be maintained to ensure compliance, and committed to\ncompleting multi-levels of review of background checks prior to hire.\n- Rule 4113(1)(e) - The facility completed updated references for the staff\nwhose references were over 12 months old, updated the new hire\nchecklist to reflect the reference requirement, and required the Quality\nAssurance specialist to sign off on the new hire checklist prior to hire.\n- Rule 4114(1) - The facility completed updated TB testing for the staff\nwhose TB test was over 12 months old and updated the new hire\nchecklist to reflect the TB testing requirement.\n- Rule 4142(1)(d) - The facility reviewed the storage of medications policy\nwith staff, supervisors completed unannounced weekly checks to ensure\n4",
    "the medication cart was locked and committed to reviewing the\nmedication storage policy quarterly at staff meetings.\n- Rule 4159(1)(d) - The facility committed to listing CPI training on the\nnewly created all staff spreadsheet to track CPI training dates and\nrequired the Quality Assurance Coordinator review the spreadsheet and\nfollow-up with staff/supervisors regarding registration and attendance.\n- Rule 4167(1) and (2) - The facility created a documentation training for\ncase management staff, reviewed file record requirements during staff\nmeetings, and implemented new case review requirements for youth\nfiles.\n- Rule 4166(1)(a-f) - The facility reviewed discharge expectations with staff\nduring staff meetings and implemented a new case file review process\nfor discharged youth.\nThe second CAP was a result of SIR #2025SIC0000019. The facility had the\nfollowing violations and addressed them in the following ways:\n- Rule 4127(4) - The facility completed trainings on the AWOL procedures\nand line of sight policy with staff on a quarterly basis, unit supervisors\ndiscussed task assignments and delegation with youth specialists during\nstaff trainings/meetings, and staff on-call expectations were updated.\n- Rule 4150(3) - The facility committed to implementing an on-call bi-\nmonthly meeting to review on-call expectations and any policy\nupdates/changes and created an outline regarding DCWL notification\nrequirements and reviewed it at the on-call bi-monthly meeting.\nFinancial Overview\nThere were no financial concerns based on review of the facility's budget and\nfinancial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported the Quality Assurance (QA) team has been\nreviewing staff files prior to hire to ensure the central registry clearance is\ncompleted as required. In addition, hiring managers are now required to complete\nBethany's New Hiring Manager Training to ensure they understand the\nexpectations and requirements for the hiring process. CA reported shelter\nsupervisors are checking the medication cart daily during their unannounced round\nto ensure the medication cart is always locked. CA reported the QA team has been\nreviewing the all-staff spreadsheet at least weekly or every other week to ensure\nstaff are up to date with CPI training and it's documented on the spreadsheet. CA\nreported case management supervisors have been reviewing due dates for service\n5",
    "plans and signatures on a weekly basis to ensure compliance. CA reported staff\nfiles have been a hardship for the team as the hiring happens at a program level,\nnot at a human resources level. CA reported some supervisors were not properly\ntrained, and sometimes requirements changed, but not all hiring managers\nreceived the updated information. CA reported the quality assurance team\ncontinues to work with hiring managers and human resources to ensure\ncompliance. CA reported program supervisors put hiring updates on their meeting\nagenda to discuss changes, and they review hiring expectations at least quarterly.\nCA reported staff meetings occur weekly, which include updates for the program as\nwell as policy and procedure reviews.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nOn 4/28/25, Assistant Program directors reported it had been approximately 2\nmonths since they last had youth admitted to the program. They reported referrals\nhave been lacking, and when referrals come in, other agencies quickly accept\nthose referrals. They reported the lack of youth in the program has allowed them\nthe space and time to revamp systems, organizational tools & tactics, and offer\nintentional training for staff. They reported they have updated shelter process,\nyouth files, file review process, and closed file process. They reported they have\nalso offered a lot of staff activities to keep staff engaged and morale high in the\nprogram while there aren't youth admitted. They reported it's been a breath of fresh\nair to have some time to think without the chaos and use the time to decompress.\nThey reported they have continued to work on determining appropriate resources\nfor staff. They reported there are very transparent conversations happening from\nupper administration, which feels really positive. The Director is setting the stage\nfor \"we are all in the same boat\" which has been well-received by staff. They\nreported teachers are getting creative with how to utilize their time, including staff\ntraining and education, especially with offering ESL (English as a Second\nLanguage) classes and Spanish classes. They reported they have also encouraged\nall staff to sign up for the MDHHS weekly emails and have found great free\ntrainings for staff through that resource.\nThe facility does not currently have any youth admitted due to a lack of referrals.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on 4/28/25 and there were no concerns\nnoted.\n6",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJune 4, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 5, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n7"
