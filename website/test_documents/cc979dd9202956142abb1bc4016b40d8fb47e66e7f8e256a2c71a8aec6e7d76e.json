    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this\nrule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of human\nservices, the equivalent state or Canadian provincial agency, or\nequivalent agency in the country where the person usually\nresides, that the person has not been determined to be a\nperpetrator of child abuse or child neglect. The documentation\nshall be completed not more than 30 days prior to the start of\nemployment and every 12 months thereafter.\nOne of 14 new employee files reviewed was found to be missing a MDHHS\nabuse/neglect clearance. The employee is a student at a local college and has an\nout of state permanent address. The other state’s abuse/neglect clearance was\ncompleted but not the Michigan clearance. Given the time the individual resides in\nMichigan during school, the clearance is required. The facility has submitted for the\nclearance at this time. REPEAT VIOLATION, Renewal Report, 03/15/21, and CAP,\n03/17/21. The facility must report why the previous CAP failed and how they\nwill ensure compliance.\nR 400.4152 Initial documentation.\nAt the time of admission, all of the following shall be in the\nresident's case record:\n(b) A photograph taken within the previous 12 months.\n(i) Documentation that the grievance policy was provided as\nrequired in R 400.4132.\n(b) One of six files reviewed did not contain a current photo of the youth.\n(i) One of six files reviewed did not contain documentation that the grievance policy\nwas provided.\n1",
    "R 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; initial treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and date an\ninitial treatment plan for each resident within 30 calendar days\nof admission.\n(3) The initial treatment plan shall include all of the following:\n(c) Treatment goals to remedy the problems of the resident\nand family, and time frames for achieving the goals.\n(h) For youth who are permanent court wards or MCI wards,\nthere must be documented co-ordination with the agency\nassigned to complete adoption or permanency planning for the\nyouth.\n(1) One of three applicable files reviewed was found to have the initial service plan\nsubmitted one day late.\n(3)(c) Two of two applicable files had initial treatment plans with no timeframes for\nthe family goals.\n(3) (h) One applicable file reviewed did not document contact with the adoption\nworker.\nR 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; updated treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and date an\nupdated treatment plan for each resident at least once every 90-\ncalendar days following the initial treatment plan.\n(1) One of three applicable files reviewed was found to have the updated service\nplan submitted two days late.\n2.)

    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR 113\nI recommended the facility put the employee’s names on their reference check forms.\nIt was advised that the facility run annual criminal history clearances.\nR 128\nThe facility was advised to ensure that all required training topics outlined in the rule\nare addressed clearly for each employee. I urged the facility Chief Administrator to\nensure more timely initial restraint training for new employees. Employees without the\ntraining are not able to use physical restraint or escort youth.\nR 140\nThe facility was advised to ensure that they are clearly documenting compliance with\ntheir written vehicle maintenance policy. Review and update your policy if needed.\nR 146\nThe facility was advised to be clearer with documentation of parental refusal for\nimmunizations. The parent refusal should document the date the refusal occurred,\nwhich parent refused (or both), and be signed by the parents. If the parents will not\nsign, the person taking the information should document their name and attempt to\nget the parental consent and signatures of refusal.\nR 153\nThe facility was advised to be more specific in identifying the services to be provided.\nR 155(2) and R 156(2)\nThe facility was advised to clearly identify who, out of the required individuals in the\nrule, provided input in the report (sources of information exchange) and not just the\ndocument sources reviewed.\nR 155\nThe facility was advised to elaborate on their plan for visitation and not just state\nvisiting hours. The plan should note how visits start and how that time is expanded\nfrom onsite visits that transition to home visits.\nR 159\nUpon review of the facility's updated policy on restraint, it was noted that the policy\nneeds to be updated and not just a restatement of the rule requirements.\nR 166\nThe facility was reminded to use the youth’s next permanent location/address and not\nthe address of the person the youth was released to, such as the probation officer’s\naddress.\n3",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nConsultation was provided related to criminal clearances.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care or substantiated\ncorporal punishment during this licensing period.\nThe facility has submitted no acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. There have been three special\ninvestigations during this period, but no violations were established in any of them.\nOne special investigation, 2022C0446023, was opened during this inspection so the\nresults will be assessed during the next period. The facility has low restraint and\nseclusion numbers. Youth report feeling supported, respected, and that they are\nbenefiting from the program. The Chief Administrator Annual Assessment addressed\nthe prior violations and an incident that occurred during this period. Overall, it appears\nthat the facility makes ongoing efforts to comply with licensing rules.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on\ntheir regular license.\nMay 4, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 4, 2022\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n4"
