    "Walk-through:\nA walk-through was completed at the facility. The facility is a\nmultiple story building in excellent repair and very clean. All\nrequired furnishing are present, and Youth A’s room was\nexamined. The room is furnished appropriately for a detention\nfacility.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as evidenced by interviews with\nstaff, youth, documents and video recording. Evidence indicates a\nrestraint was initiated because Youth A was in the process of\nattacking Supervisor 2 and to protect himself, Supervisor 2\ninitiated the restraint and did not hit nor use inappropriate\nlanguage towards Youth A. Eyewitnesses to the event support the\ninitiation of the restraint and documented Youth A being\ndysregulated with violent behavior prior to the restraint. There is\nno evidence that Supervisor 2 engaged in racists activities or\nactions at the facility and evidence support that Staff 3, Staff 4,\nand Staff 5 were engaging in speaking to youth in an effort to\npromote false information about Supervisor 2.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding the three staff that\nappeared to be engaged in attempting to influence youth into\nbelieving Supervisor 2 does not have their best interest in mind.\nThe facility should engage in training that helps staff understand\nthat this type of behavior is inappropriate and harmful to youth and\nstaff. This should be developed in a policy and the facility needs to\nhave a zero tolerance for this type of destructive behavior.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n15",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
