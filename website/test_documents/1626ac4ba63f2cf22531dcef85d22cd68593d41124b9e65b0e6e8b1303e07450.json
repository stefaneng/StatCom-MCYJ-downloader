    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Compliance with the child protection law\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12214\nSection • (1) An agency shall comply with the child protection law,\nDescription 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Parent notified her daughter's foster care worker that her daughter\nwas abused and neglected by her Foster Parents while in their\ncare; however, the foster care worker did not report the allegation\nto MDHHS.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing\non 10/17/2024. She stated she is the supervisor for Parent A and\nYouth A’s case as well as the supervisor for the foster home\nlicensing workers. She stated she received an email from Parent\nA on 9/30/24 that included concerns regarding Caregiver A &\nCaregiver B. The foster home in which Caregiver A’s child, Youth\nA, had previously been placed. After reading the email, she met\nwith her supervisor to briefly discuss what was reported in the\nemail. On 10/2/24, Foster Care Supervisor met with her supervisor\nas well as the agency’s executive director to discuss the initiation\nof a foster home licensing Special Evaluation. Foster Care\nSupervisor reported initiating the special evaluation the following\nday. Foster Care Supervisor stated she did not report the\nallegations to MDHHS intake for investigation as there was\nnothing within the email that made her suspect abuse or neglect;\nrather, the concerns were related to potential foster home rule\nviolations. Foster Care Supervisor stated she has not reached out\nto Parent A to schedule a meeting as she wanted to wait until this\ninterview to ensure she wasn’t impeding on the investigation. She\nstated she would contact Parent A after the interview.\nParent A was interviewed by phone on 11/8/2024. She stated she\nemailed Foster Care Supervisor and cc’d Foster Care Worker a\nlist of concerns she had related to the care of her child while in\nfoster care on 9/30/24. Foster Care Supervisor responded on the\nfollowing day asking if Parent A and Youth A could meet. Parent A\nresponded with her availability, but she did not hear back from\nFoster Care Supervisor until 10/10/2024. Parent A stated Youth\nA’s former probation officer told Parent A on 10/1/24 that Foster\nCare Supervisor should have reported Parent A’s concerns to\n2",
    "MDHHS intake. Since Parent A had not received any confirmation\nfrom Foster Care Supervisor that she had reported the concerns\nto MDHHS intake or any other applicable department, she\nreported the concerns she reported to Foster Care Supervisor as\nwell as additional concerns related to the food and a few other\nthings to MDHHS intake, DCWL, and the Foster Care Review\nBoard. She stated she has not heard back from anyone other than\nDCWL regarding her allegations.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n• 9/30/24 email from Parent A to Foster Care Worker and\nFoster Care Supervisor stating Youth A shared concerning\nthings related to her prior foster home placement including:\n1. Youth A and Caregiver A were in the garage and\nCaregiver A asked Youth A to pinky promise to not\nshare a secret. That secret was Caregiver A stopped\nusing cocaine but planned to start using again once her\nson turned 18 and that she knows how to pass a drug\ntest.\n2. Youth A and other youths in the home got “pedophile\nvibes” from Caregiver B.\n3. One day, Caregiver B put his hands and arms around\nYouth A, against a wall or couch. Youth A said she was\nvery uncomfortable with Caregiver A in her face,\nhovering over her & preventing her from moving. He\neventually moved.\n4. On several occasions, Caregiver B would stand in a\ndoorway sideways so Youth A would have to walk past\nhim closely to get by.\n5. Caregiver A would sit at the table using his computer\nand move the camera, so it was pointing away from\nwhat he was doing.\n6. Youth A watched every season of the show Shameless\nwhile in the foster home, which is inappropriate.\n7. Caregiver B yelled and screamed at Youth A for things\nlike not knowing where to put clean dishes.\n8. Caregiver A acts differently when Foster Care Worker is\nat the home.\n9. Caregiver A told Youth A she wants to keep Youth A in\nthe home throughout high school, which Parent A\nbelieved was so they would continue to receive checks\nto support Caregiver A’s drug habit.\n10. On two occasions, some of Youth A’s money was\nmissing when she returned to the foster home after a\n3",
    "visit and school. When Youth a told Caregiver A and\nCaregiver B, they became upset and angry with Youth\nA, accusing her of implying they took her money rather\nthan listening to her concerns\n• 10/2/2024 Request for Foster Care Review Board Case\nReview submitted by Parent A in which she alleged\nCaregiver A and Caregiver B physically and emotionally\nabused Youth A by refusing to allow Youth A to eat and\nusing food as punishment, physically pinning Youth A to the\ncouch, and using emotional abuse. Parent A included the\nfollowing details of the alleged abuse:\n1. When Youth A was first placed in the home, Caregiver\nA and Caregiver B would tell her when dinner was\nready. One day they stopped, and Youth A wasn’t\npaying attention to the time and was denied food\nbecause she went to the kitchen after the dinner time of\n6 pm. This happened several times as the caregivers\nwould arbitrarily tell Youth A when dinner was ready or\nnot, so she didn’t know what to expect. There were\ntimes when Youth A was eating dinner, Caregiver B\nwould tell her to eat more, commenting on her eating\nhabits. There were times when Youth A was denied a\nsnack even if she didn’t eat dinner.\n2. Caregiver B put his hands and arms around Youth A,\nholding her against the couch with his face hovering\nover hers, preventing her from moving. As she was\nabout to tell him to move, he did.\n3. Caregiver A taunted Youth A after she came to her with\na problem. Caregiver A also demeaned Youth A in front\nof other people by saying Youth A’s hair always looks\ngreasy and other mean comments. Caregiver A told\nYouth A what she thought and liked, disregarding Youth\nA’s independent thoughts and interests which upset\nYouth A.\n• 10/2/2024 MDHHS Intake Notification in which the same\ninformation documented on the Request for Foster Care\nReview Board Case Review was provided by Parent A. It\nwas determined the allegations did not meet the criteria for\nalleged abuse or neglect.\n• 10/3/2024 online licensing complaint from Parent A alleging\nshe reported mistreatment of Youth A as outlined in the\n4",
    "document attached (the 10/2/2024 Request for Foster\nCare Review Board Case Review) to Listening Ear Crisis\nCenter on 9/30/2024 after which they responded on\n10/2/2024 asking if Parent A and Youth A would like to\nmeet. Parent A responded she did but has not since heard\nback.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as, the email sent by Parent A\nto Foster Care Supervisor did not include information that would\nrequire Foster Care Supervisor to contact MDHHS.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nNovember 8, 2024\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 12, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
