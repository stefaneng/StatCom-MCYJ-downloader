    "MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES\nBUREAU OF CHILDREN AND ADULT LICENSING\nADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL LICENSING STUDY REPORT\nI. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\nLicense #: CP820201497\nLicensee Name: Michigan Department of Human Services\nLicensee Address: 235 South Grand Avenue\nLansing, MI 48902\nLicensee Telephone #: (517) 373-3768\nAdministrator/Licensee Designee: Charlotte Kennedy, Administrator\nMaura Corrigan, Designee\nName of Facility: Wayne County DHS - Western\nFacility Address: 4505 Oakman Blvd.\nDetroit, MI 48204\nFacility Telephone #: (313) 934-8910\nCapacity:\nProgram Type: CHILD PLACING AGENCY, FIA\n1",
    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nWayne County DHS – Western District vacated the office at 25350 Ecorse Rd in\nTaylor and moved to an office at 4505 Oakman Blvd. in Detroit.\nIII. Methodology\nAn on-site inspection by this consultant was completed on 1/14/14. The former local\noffice Director, Dianna Pyles, retired in October 2013. The new Acting Director is\nCharlotte Kennedy. Ms. Kennedy’s fingerprints are pending.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThis consultant toured the facility. The building is about half the size of the former\none and in a much less convenient location for the clients it serves. The agency has\nformed relationships with churches and business owners in the Western Wayne\ncommunity. These community-based organizations have offered space for mobile\nstaff and supervised foster care visits. Often, there are not enough on-site parking\nspaces for all of the employees. Most office-bound staff share a cubicle. The\nparking lot has inadequate lighting, which is being addressed. The lobby and three\nemployee entrances/exits are monitored by two security guards and four security\ncameras. The restrooms, kitchen and file storage areas are adequate.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend this agency continue its current license at the new location.\nJanuary 15, 2014\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n2"
