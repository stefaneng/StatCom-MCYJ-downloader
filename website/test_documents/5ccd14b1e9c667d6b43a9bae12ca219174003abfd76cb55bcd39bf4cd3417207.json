Youth was\nmocked for wearing a helmet.

Staff 2 reported she\nworked for the facility for one week and resigned on January 19, 2023.\nThe reason Staff 2 resigned on January 19, 2023, was due to the\nconcerns within the allegations and she stated she did not tell her\nemployer her concerns but rather stated the position was not a good fit\nfor her. Staff 2 reported on that day, Youth A was crying a lot and staff\nwere trying to encourage him to go to the dining room area for lunch.\nShe reported Staff 1 was sitting on the couch and Youth A joined him\non the couch. Staff 2 reported Youth A stood up and maneuvered his\nway between Staff 1’s back and the backing of the couch. She stated\nYouth A then put his arms around Staff 1’s neck and Staff 1 ended up\ngrabbing on to Youth A’s arms to stabilize him and stood up. She\nreported Staff 1 spun in a circle with Youth A on his back and then he\nset Youth A on the couch. She reported she was unsure why Staff 1\nspun Youth A in a circle on his back. When asked did she think it was\nto assist with getting Youth A off his back she reported she did not\nknow. Staff 2 reported she does not think Staff 1 did this to cause harm\nto Youth A. She reported she has never seen another staff member do\nthis and this is her second time shadowing on this unit. Staff 2 reported\nYouth A will hit his head against the walls at time and staff have to put a\nhelmet on him. She reported Staff 1 and Staff 3 were mocking Youth A\nfor a long period of time when he had his helmet on. When asked what\nthe mocking was she reported both Staff 1 and Staff 3 said to Youth A\n“Hahaha now you cannot hit your head against the wall.” Staff 2\nreported another concern was that Youth A will also run around the\nliving area flapping his arms and Staff 1 and Staff 3 just continued to\nchase him around.

Staff 1 reported\nthis is a common occurrence and he will tell Youth A “safety first” before\nputting his helmet on. He reported staff also will follow Youth A with a\nsafety pad so if Youth A tries to hit the front of his head staff can use\nthe pad to protect Youth A’s head.

She reported she never saw Staff 1 swing\nYouth A in circles off his back. Supervisor 2 reported Youth A will show\nsigns he is about to head bang by running around more.
