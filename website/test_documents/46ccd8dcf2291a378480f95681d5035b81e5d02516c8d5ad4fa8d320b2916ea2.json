    "Two of three foster care files reviewed documented three PATP’s with late\nsignatures.

    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the CAP is as follows:\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan on 11/06/23 in\nresponse to those violations established during the 09/26/23 Interim inspection.\nThe agency CAP was successful in preventing a repeat violation of R 400.12413,\nMedical and Dental. The CAP did fail to prevent a repeat violation of FOM 722-\n08D, Treatment Plans, as the current inspection established a violation of this\npolicy. There were no other violations established during the 2023 inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrators Assessment was reviewed. The assessment was\nthorough and addressed the agency's efforts to comply with the Interim 2023 CAP.\nBarriers were noted. One barrier was a foster care worker vacancy which created\nadditional workload for existing foster care staff. Extra travel time was part of the\nincreased workload workers experienced due to the vacancy. An experienced\nfoster care supervisor left the agency, which for a period of time increased the\nwork load of the other existing supervisor. The newly hired supervisor is currently\nlearning the requirements of her position. Two experienced foster care workers\nalso left the agency which created an additional burden on existing staff.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency is a local DHHS office, and financial records were not available.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported enjoying working for the agency. They reported that\ntheir respective supervisors are supportive and knowledgeable. Staff reported they\nfeel they are part of a supportive team, and everyone works together in making the\nagency a well functioning program.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is located in a modern local DHHS building in downtown Escanaba.\nThe building is well maintained and has sufficient office space. CHRI documents\nwere observed to be stored securely.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe CPA Analyst identified one safety alert during her visits to the homes.\nSafety Alert #1: The safety alert was generated on 07/11/24. The smoke alarm\nrequired a new battery to be operable and was repositioned to meet the requirement.\nResolution: The caseworker observed via zoom a new battery being placed into the\nsmoke detector and positioned outside of the bedrooms.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nSeptember 20, 2024\n_____________________________________\nDouglas Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 23, 2024\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
