Although all\nthe youth stated Staff 1 called Youth A, “bitch,” none of the staff\nreported this.

    "Staff 2 reported the youth in the unit take showers one by one.\nStaff 2 reported the youth are locked in their rooms while other\nyouth take showers. Staff 2 reported showers are around 6:00pm\ndaily. This is their normal daily procedure.\nStaff 1 reported all youth are in their locked rooms at shower time,\naround 6:00pm until showers are over. Staff 1 reported the youth\ndon’t always come out of their rooms when showers are\ncompleted. Showers can take until 8:00pm to complete, in which\nat this time, youth are to be in their bedrooms for the night. Other\ntimes, if showers are completed before 8:00pm, the staff will\ndecide if the youth can come out of their rooms for free time based\non their behaviors they exhibited in the day. Staff 1 reported if\nthere have not been behaviors throughout the day prohibiting their\nfree time, staff will then assess if permitting the youth out of their\nrooms will cause problems during free time. If they feel that it\nmight, they do not allow them out for free time.\nStaff 3 reported on 12/12/2023, Youth A was upset that other\nyouth were taking too long in the shower. If showers were not\ncompleted before 8:00pm, youth were not able to come out of\ntheir bedrooms for recreation time. Staff 3 reported showers are\ndone one by one. All youth are locked in their room and take\nturns. Staff 3 reported they start showers at 6:00pm and when\nshowers are done, they may have time for recreation time. Youth\nare to go into their bedrooms at 8:00pm for bedtime. Staff 3\nreported she works five shifts a week and the youth are able to\ncome out of their room maybe 3 out of 5 nights for recreation.\nStaff 3 reported the reasons the youth would not receive\nrecreation time is if the youth were slow to take showers and if\ntheir behaviors were not good. Staff 3 reported recreation time\nmight include coloring, watching television or socializing.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed via telephone on 01/16/2024\nand reported youth have always been locked in their rooms while\nshowers were taken. Administrator 1 stated the youth take\nshowers one at a time and can have books in their rooms if the\nclinicians allow it. Administrator 1 reported after showers, the staff\nwill decide what activities they may engage in.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• The Program Statement states:\nDaily Activity Structuring: Each part of the day, from wake-up\nuntil bedtime, shall be structured and planned. By carefully\nstructuring time, youth are constructively and productively\n5",
    "engaged in activities throughout the day. The daily activities\nshall include attending to personal hygiene, making beds,\npreparing for meals, doing work projects, eating meals,\nparticipating in group meetings, attending school, attending\nplacement interviews, participating in recreational activities\nand individual counseling.\nThe Calumet Detention Center provides a structured program of\ndaily recreation and leisure activities. Space is designated for\nthis purpose. Youth activities contain a variety of physical,\nintellectual, social and cultural opportunities (both indoors and\noutdoors) and are always staff supervised. The Calumet Center\nhas a gym, multipurpose room, outside recreational yard, pod\nliving rooms, an art room and ten classrooms to use for recreation.\nRecreational activities are delivered within the framework\ndefinitions for a secure Detention Facility. Recreational activities\nare defined as planned, regular, and recurring set of staff\nsupervised leisure time events, designed to support the\nyouth’s Treatment Plan.\n• The Pod K Girl’s Schedule was reviewed:\nThe afternoon schedule does not lay out specific recreational\nactivities scheduled.\n4:30-5:30: Dinner, Task Work, Free Time\n5:30-6:30: Problem Solving Group Assistance, Confirmations,\nFree Time\n7:30-8:00: Level 1 Curfew, Higher Privilege Level Activities\n8:00-8:30: Level 2 Curfew, Higher Privilege Level Activities\n8:30-9:00: Level 3 Curfew, Higher Privilege Level Activities\n9:00-9:30: Level 4 Curfew, Higher Privilege Level Activities\nAnalysis Based upon interviews with Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 as well as\nAdministrator 1, the agency is in noncompliance of secluding\nyouth. The facility is secluding youth at shower time which starts\naround 6:00pm until morning wake up at 6:00am. At times, the\nyouth are able to come out of their rooms if they have enough time\nbefore their bedtime or if they have been behaviorally doing well\nthroughout the day. Secluding youth during shower time is not a\nresponse to behaviors that threaten immediate harm to youth or\nothers and cannot be used within the program.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe agency’s schedule for the unit is a generic schedule. The\nprogram statement states the schedule for the youth are planned\nand structured so that the youth can be productive throughout the\n6",
    "day. Based on the program statement, these activities are to\nprovide “physical, intellectual, social and cultural opportunities.”\nThe agency should be documenting these recreational activities\nthroughout the day in alignment with the treatment goals of the\nyouth in their care. This would allow staff to be prepared for the\nactivity ahead of time, knowing the expectations, and treatment\naims as well as providing the youth with activities to look forward\nto. Instead of placing the youth in seclusion during shower time,\nthe agency may want to incorporate these activities. All staff\ninterviewed did not have a planned out recreational activity. It was\nsomething they decided during their shift.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n02/05/2024\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
