Clinician reported she saw scratches on his neck, and\nmarks on his arms and knees, but she’s not sure what happened\nor if the marks were from the incident since she wasn’t present.\nClinician reported there have been 2-3 times Youth A was\n“ramped up” and she has witnessed Staff 1 feed into his behavior\nmore than she de-escalates it.

One proactive\nstrategy to use is to take Youth A to an area where staff\ncan engage with him 1 on 1 without an audience (i.e.\ncafeteria). Crisis intervention strategies include clearing\nthe space of other peers and staff, offering him space,\nremaining calm and speaking calmly.\n• Incident Report dated 7/24/25 authored by APM 1 was\nconsistent with APM 1’s interview.\n• Incident Report dated 7/24/25 authored by Staff 1 was\nconsistent with Staff 1’s interview.\n• Discipline Policy states the facility prohibits any type of\ncorporal punishment inflicted in any manner.\n8",

RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nSeptember 8, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 12, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n9"
