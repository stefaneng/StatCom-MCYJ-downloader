Staff 1 said\nYouth A was not struggling so he had his hand on Youth A’s chest\nuntil Staff 2 arrived at which time he took his hand off Youth A.\nStaff 1 said there is no training or CPI technique to break up a\nfight. Staff 1 said they are trained to use Child Control Position for\na one-person restraint, noting Youth A is “too big” for that position.\nStaff 1 said the CPI transport is with two staff however they did not\nhave the second staff available in that situation so to minimize\nsafety risk he moved Youth A alone.

Supervisor said after review of the\nvideo she noted the staff should have noticed Youth A kept his\ntray after clearing his spot and got to him prior to the situation.\nSupervisor said Staff 1, Staff 4 and Staff 5 all separated the youth\nwhich was appropriate. Supervisor said Staff 1 should have used\nor attempted to use the “emergency child control position” or hold\nhim and wait for other staff.

Supervisor said the training does not\ninclude the techniques that Staff 1 used during the incident.\nSupervisor said it is staff judgement call on if they are to move a\nyouth alone.
