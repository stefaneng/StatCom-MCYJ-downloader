    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth’s\ntreatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 6/15/23, youth was restrained for 20 minutes by four staff\nmembers. Two staff members restrained at a time and switched\nout. One of the staff had left bruises on the youth’s left and right\nelbows and shoulders. The bruises were not observed. The youth\ntook pain medicine after the restraint, and it is unknown if the\nyouth required medical attention.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nNote: Youth A prefers they/them pronouns and will be referred to\nas such throughout the report.\nComplainant/Staff 1 was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 7/10/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1\nwas one of the 5 employees involved in the restraint regarding\nYouth A. Staff 1 reported on the evening of 6/15/23, the youth had\ntaken their nighttime medications and were getting ready for bed.\nStaff 1 completed a check on Youth A as they were in their room,\nand Staff 1 found Youth A upset and crying. Staff 1 asked Youth A\nif they wanted to talk, but Youth A refused. Youth A requested\ntheir PRN medication for anxiety, so Staff 1 accommodated the\nrequest. A few minutes later, Youth A was seen in the milieu\nwalking around slowly. Staff 1 reported Staff 5 asked Youth A why\nthey were out in the milieu at the time because it was bedtime.\nYouth A yelled at Staff 5, said “don’t assume anything”, went to\ntheir room and slammed the door. A couple minutes later, Youth A\nexited their room, went into the hallway, and walked out the door\nleading outside the home. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 followed Youth\nA out of the home. Staff 1 handed the medication room key to\nStaff 6 and then left the home to follow Youth A and Staff 2. Staff\n1 reported he received a call from Staff 2 stating they were\nheading towards the garden/hill area towards the road. Staff 1\nstated he called Supervisor while he was walking so she was\naware of what was happening. When Staff 1 arrived at the\ngarden/hill area, Staff 2 was talking to Youth A, but was not having\n2",
    "any success redirecting or de-escalating Youth A. Staff 1 called\nfor backup. Staff 2 set a boundary for Youth A to not go past a\ncertain point heading towards the road, but Youth A was not\nlistening and continued to walk towards the road. Staff 2 asked\nStaff 1 to help him initiate a restraint for youth safety. Youth A was\nnot communicating or responding to both staff at the time, and\nwas not stopping, so both staff believed the restraint was\nnecessary to prevent imminent risk of harm. Staff 1 reported they\nperformed a Reverse Level 1 Aegis Hold. When they were in the\nhold, Youth A reported they wanted to throw themselves into the\nroad, in front of a car, to end their life. Staff 1 reported Supervisor\narrived and assessed the current situation. Staff 1 told Supervisor\nhe needed a break, so Supervisor switched out with him and\nmaintained the restraint. Supervisor gave Staff 1 her phone\nbecause Staff 3 was calling, and Staff 1 requested Staff 3 join\nthem for additional support. During the restraint, Staff 1 reported\nYouth A was fighting aggressively to get out of the hold and said\nthey reported they took notes and practiced how to get out of\nholds. Staff 1 reported Youth A was attempting to do backflips to\nget out of the hold and bit Staff 1 on the shoulder. The staff started\nwith a Reverse Level 1 standing hold, but then switched to a\nReverse Level 1 safety ground restraint due to Youth A’s kicking.\nWhen Staff 3 arrived, she switched out with Staff 2. Staff 4 arrived\nshortly after, but he only observed, and did not participate in the\nrestraint. Supervisor asked Youth A if they could start walking\naway from the road, towards the garden and Youth A refused.\nSupervisor asked Youth A if their intent was to harm themself by\ngoing into the road and Youth A confirmed it was. After about 20\nminutes, Youth A noticed their watch was broken and asked to\nlook for a missing piece. Supervisor offered to look for the watch\nwhile Staff 2 and Staff 1 escorted Youth A back to the house.\nYouth A agreed, so Staff 1 and Staff 2 went into a Level 2 hold to\nhelp escort them back to the facility safely. While walking back to\nthe home, Youth A said multiple times both their arms hurt and\nstated Staff 1 held the restraint too tight on the left side. When\nthey arrived at the house, Staff 1 and Staff 2 were able to end the\nrestraint because Youth A was no longer fighting or trying to harm\nthemselves. Youth A was crying and was very emotional, so they\nrequested to sit outside. Youth A sat outside while Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 tried to talk to them. Youth A asked that they be allowed to\ncry and communicate what they were feeling but asked the staff\nnot to respond. Youth A reported this was their first time trying to\nkill themself by walking into the road. While outside, Youth A\nnoticed some bruises on their left arm and blamed Staff 1 for the\nbruises. Youth A spent approximately 10-15 minutes outside de-\nescalating before wanting to go inside. Upon entering the home,\n3",
    "Staff 1 obtained pain medicine from the medication cart for Youth\nA while Staff 2 was checking in with Youth A in their bedroom.\nStaff 1 reported the restraints were done properly per their training\nand the youth’s plan.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/21/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A’s Foster Care\nWorker was also present for Youth A’s interview per Youth\nA’s request. Youth A reported the last few weeks have been\nchaos and they feel they need a medication change because they\nare very angry all the time for no reason and blow up at others,\neven over something small. They feel their anger is rooted in the\ndepression and is working with their therapist on it. Youth A\nreported last week Thursday, they walked out of the house,\nwalked through the path in the woods and tried to walk into the\nroad to hurt themself. Youth A reported Staff 1 and Staff 2\nfollowed them through the woods and to the area by the highway.\nYouth A reported Staff 2 put them in a restraint because they\nreported they wanted to kill themself by walking into the road.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 switched out of the restraint\nwith Supervisor and Staff 3. Youth A reported Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere trying to keep them safe, but they kept fighting to get out of\nthe restraint by stabbing staff with their nails, kicking all staff who\nwere restraining, bit Staff 1, and trying to kick and do backflips.\nYouth A reported their arms were hurting for about 3 days\nafterwards and they had a few bruises on their upper arms and\none by their left elbow. Youth A reported all the bruising on their\nlower arms was self-inflicted due to snapping a rubber band on\ntheir arms. Youth A reported none of the staff did anything wrong\nduring the restraint and did not intentionally hurt them. Youth A\nreported they were fighting so hard to get out of the restraint and\nthey know that’s what caused the bruises. Youth A reported all\nstaff were holding her appropriately and no one was pushing,\npulling, grabbing unnecessarily, using too much force, hitting, etc.\nYouth A reported they did not have any concerns with the restraint\nor with any of the staff. Youth A reported they feel safe at the\nfacility and if anything went wrong or they felt unsafe, they feel\nthey could talk to any of the staff about it because all the staff are\nawesome.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n6/21/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Administrator 1\nreported Youth A saw the nurse at the facility the day following the\nrestraint. Administrator 1 reported the weekend after the restraint\noccurred, Youth A was taken to Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital\n4",
    "for a check-up due to the bruising and Youth A complaining of\npain in their arms.\nTherapist was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n6/21/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Therapist reported\nshe saw Youth A on 6/20/23 and Youth A did not talk about the\nrestraint. Therapist reported she received an email from Youth A’s\nFoster Care Worker (FC Worker) on 6/16/23 stating Youth A told\ntheir FC Worker they received bruising from trying to get out of the\nrestraint and stated they knew no one was intentionally trying to\nhurt them. Therapist reported Youth A is vocal about letting staff\nknow when they are struggling, when they need help and\nexpressing when they feel they are going to self- harm. Therapist\nreviewed the Behavior Observation Record, email from the on-call\nclinician the night of the restraint and was able to talk to staff\nabout what happened the night of the restraint. Therapist reported\nstaff handled things appropriately based on Youth A’s treatment\nplan and safety plan. Therapist reported she created the treatment\nplan with Youth A. Therapist stated staff followed Youth A’s lead\nwith regards to questioning, offering options, etc. Therapist noted\nthe most important thing staff did during the incident was they\nassessed risk before acting and restraining.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported the\nevening of 6/15/23, Youth A walked out of the house, and he\nfollowed them. Staff 2 reported he was trying to assess Youth A’s\nemotional state by asking questions about Youth A’s intention\n(i.e., AWOL, self-harm, simply wanted to walk, etc.), but Youth A\nwould not respond or talk to Staff 2 at all. As they approached the\ngarden area, Staff 1 arrived. Youth A continued to try and\napproach the road. Staff 2 reported he told Youth A, “I don’t know\nwhat’s happening right now, and I don’t feel safe with you walking\ntowards the road”. Staff 2 stated he set a boundary for Youth A\nand said, “if you walk past this point, we are going to have to\ninitiate a restraint”. Staff 2 reported he continued to try use verbal\nde-escalation tactics with Youth A prior to initiating the restraint.\nStaff 2 reported he and Staff 1 updated Youth A the whole time on\nwhat they were going to have to do or what they were doing to\nrestrain Youth A. After initiating the restraint, Youth A became\nupset Staff 1 and Staff 2 stopped them from going into the road\nand kept saying “Let me go. I just want to go into the road. I can’t\ndo this anymore”. Staff 2 stated Supervisor arrived at the scene,\nhelped with the restraint, and helped coach through the restraint.\nShortly after, Staff 3 also arrived and assisted. Supervisor and\nStaff 3 switched in and out of the restraint with Staff 1 and Staff 2.\n5",
    "At one point, Youth A bit Staff 1 on the shoulder. Staff 2 reported\nthey completed a Level 1 standing restraint and then went into a\nLevel 1 seated safety position due to Youth A fighting to get out of\nthe restraint. Staff 2 reported Youth A was actively trying to break\nthe restraint by thrashing their arms, kicking their feet, and trying\nto do backflips. Staff 2 felt they did the best they could to keep\nYouth A safe and secure in the restraint without injuring Youth A.\nEventually, Youth A became very emotional and sad rather than\nangry and aggressive. When Youth A entered this state, they\nagreed to walk away from the road and Staff 1 and Staff 2 were\nable to escort Youth A back to the house. While walking back,\nStaff 2 reported Youth A said “that was the least shitty restraint\nI’ve ever seen or been a part of. I thought you guys were going to\nhurt me, but you didn’t try to”. Youth A apologized to Staff 1 for\nbiting him during the restraint and said Staff 1 hurt their arm. Staff\n2 reported he couldn’t see any bruises on Youth A’s arms at the\ntime because it was dark out. Staff 2 reported when they arrived at\nthe house, Youth A did not want to talk about anything with staff\nand just wanted to sit and cry. Staff 2 reported they checked\nYouth A for injuries, and there was a mark on Youth A’s upper arm\nfrom the restraint, but he couldn’t remember which arm. Staff 2\nreported Youth A had a lot of bruises on their lower arms from\nsnapping a hair tie as a form of self-harm and Youth A provided\nstaff with the hair tie when they returned to the home. Staff 2\nreported the restraint was done appropriately per their training, no\nstaff were aggressive with Youth A, and he did not feel anyone\nheld Youth A too tight.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported she called\nSupervisor on the night of 6/15/23, Staff 1 answered the phone,\nand he asked her to come to the garden area for assistance with a\nrestraint. When Staff 3 arrived at the scene, she switched out with\nStaff 2 and was completing the Reverse Level 1 standing restraint\nwith Staff 1. Staff 3 reported Youth A was kicking their legs and\ntrying to fight to get out of the restraint, so Staff 3 and Staff 1\nadjusted to a seated restraint. Staff 3 reported they ended up\nadjusting back to a standing restraint and she switched out with\nStaff 2. Staff 3 reported she then called Staff 4 and asked him to\ncome to the garden for additional support. While she made that\ncall, Staff 3 reported Supervisor was on the phone with Chief\nAdministrator requesting approval to have the restraint go on\nlonger due to Youth A still not being safe or calm. Staff 3 reported\nYouth A was screaming, calling the staff names, telling the staff\nthey would kill them, demanding staff let them go and saying they\njust wanted to die. Staff 3 reported staff were not aggressive\n6",
    "during the restraint, and it was done properly per their training.\nStaff 3 reported staff were not escalating the restraint or making\nany concerning statements towards Youth A to agitate them. Staff\n3 reported Youth A finally calmed down and said they wanted to\nget out of the restraint because they were tired and\nuncomfortable. Staff 3 reported they all asked Youth A if they were\nready to go back to the house and be safe, to which Youth A\nagreed. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 escorted Youth A back\nto the house in a Level 2 restraint to ensure their safety, and when\nthey arrived back at the house, they disengaged the restraint.\nYouth A wanted to sit on the ground and cry by the house but did\nnot want to engage with staff or have a conversation with staff, so\nStaff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3 stood outside with Youth A and\nobserved. Staff 3 reported she left once Youth A entered the\nhouse with Staff 1 and Staff 2.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 reported he\nreceived a call from Staff 3 stating they needed support at the\ngarden area, so he went to assist. When he arrived, Staff 4\nreported Youth A was sitting in the grass in a seated restraint with\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 on either side of them. Staff 4 reported the\nrestraint was being completed appropriately per their training.\nStaff 4 reported Youth A was very upset and seemed to be having\na panic attack as they were upset, short of breath and crying. After\na few minutes, Staff 1, Staff 2 and Youth A stood up and Staff 1\nand Staff 2 were able to escort Youth A away from the road.\nDuring the walk back to the house, Staff 4 heard Youth A state\nStaff 1 hurt their arm during the restraint because Staff 1 held too\ntight. Staff 4 reported he did not see any bruises on Youth A’s\narms at the time. Staff 4 reported he observed part of the restraint,\nand it did not look like Staff 1 was holding too tight.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n7/10/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor\nreceived a call from Staff 1 stating Youth A walked out of the\nhouse and he and Staff 2 were following Youth A. Supervisor\nreceived another call from Staff 1 requesting support at the garden\narea by the road by Dean Lake. When she arrived on scene, Staff\n1 and Staff 2 were holding Youth A in a Reverse Level 1 standing\nrestraint. Due to them being so close to the road and Youth A\nbeing so aggressive trying to get out of the restraint, Supervisor\ninstructed the staff to go into a seated restraint position for safety.\nThen Staff 1 and Staff 2 went back into a standing position\nbecause Youth A continued to fight and was trying to do backflips\nto get out of the seated position. When they were standing again,\n7",
    "they tried to walk Youth A backwards, while still in the restraint, to\nback away from the road. Supervisor reported she told Youth A\nthey could end the restraint if they calmed down and was willing to\nbe safe, but Youth A continued to report intent to go into the road\nto end their life. Supervisor reported at one point, Youth A stated\ntheir arm hurt, so staff adjusted, and Supervisor assessed Youth A\nfor injuries, to which she found none. Supervisor reported Youth A\nhad full mobility in their arm and there were no marks, so she\nassessed Youth A’s arm was sore from her fighting so hard to get\nout of the restraint. Supervisor reported she called and spoke to\nthe clinical on call manager to discuss the situation. When Youth\nA became calmer, they were able to back away from the road and\nthen Youth A agreed to go back to the house. Supervisor reported\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 escorted Youth A back to the house in a hold\nfor safety reasons. Supervisor reported she was on the phone and\nwas walking further behind Staff 1, Staff 2 and Youth A, so she\nwas not present when they arrived back at the home. Supervisor\nreported she checked in on Youth A later that night and Youth A\nreported they get manic sometimes and can’t control themself, so\nif they cannot find objects to self-harm with, they will go to more\ndrastic measures. Supervisor reported Youth A had marks and\nbruises up and down their forearms from snapping a rubber band\non their forearm for self-harm. Supervisor also noticed a bruise on\nYouth A’s shoulder but couldn’t remember which arm. Supervisor\nreported the restraint happened properly, per their training.\nSupervisor noted they were constantly assessing and trying to de-\nescalate the situation. Supervisor stated staff were even mindful of\nhow much time they were in the restraint and followed appropriate\nsteps to get approval to go past the recommended or allowed\ntimeframes. Supervisor reported staff were not aggressive with\nYouth A and did nothing to escalate the situation.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident Report #156930205 from incident on 6/15/23 was\nconsistent with Staff 1’s interview.\n• D.A.
