The\nComplainant advised that there were no additional concerns.\nALLEGATION:\nDuring a case review, no foster home visit was entered/completed for June 2021.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn September 23, 2021, I interviewed Staff 2 via telephone. Staff 2 reported she\nwas the assigned foster care worker until mid-June 2021. Staff 2 reported while she\nwas the assigned foster care worker she completed foster home visits, including\nface-to-face contacts with each child to verify the children’s well-being. However,\nshe could not recall if an actual home visit was completed in June 2021, but she did\nreport seeing the children face-to-face during June. Staff 2 further reported that she\nwas the only foster care worker at the time and there were times information was not\nentered or uploaded timely into MISACWIS.\nOn September 23, 2021, I interviewed Supervisor via telephone. Supervisor reported\nshe was Staff 2’s supervisor until she left the position in mid-June 2021. Supervisor\nthen took over case responsibility. Supervisor reported she did complete a home\nvisit in June 2021 but could not recall the date and could not say for sure if she\ncompleted a quality visit. Supervisor reported the agency struggled entering contacts\nand uploading documentation timely. Supervisor reported the agency has been\nstruggling with staffing issues and at this time she is carrying a full caseload as a\nsupervisor.\nSeptember 22, 2021, I reviewed the MiSACWIS case record.
