Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.)

The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS\nContract/Policy requirements.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not offered technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency did not submit any corrective action plans during this licensing\nperiod.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nThe Chief Administrator Annual Assessment was reviewed. The 2021 renewal did\nnot have any violations. The Administrator reported that LAS has followed\nrecommendations and procedural changes presented by MCI and the Adoption\nAssistance office. The agency identified and continued some innovations,\nnecessitated by the pandemic, such as virtual orientations, trainings, and virtual\ntherapeutic support interventions which allowed some families more direct access to\ninformation and support. The agency recognized their local court jurisdictions have\nhad resultant delays in their ability to best support timely adoption permanency. Over\nthe course of the last two years some local courts have, at times, not been able to\naccept packets ready to be filed and have had less openings to schedule adoption\nhearings. Regardless, LAS continues to push hard to achieve timely permanency for\nchildren and solutions to reduce barriers that threaten to delay permanency.\nInterviews:\n4",
    "One adoption worker was interviewed. She reported she has worked for the agency\nfor several years. The worker reported she enjoyed her job and she receive support\nfrom her direct supervisor and her coworkers. She reported feeling very supported by\nher administration. She did not express any areas in which she feels the agency\ncould improve upon.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy. It is\nrecommended that Lutheran Adoption Services continue on a regular license.\n03/21/2022\n________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 22, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
