She also advised that Operations Manager (OM) had\ncompleted conflict resolution with both Youth A and Staff 1. RC\ndescribed the incident as “horseplay”. The DHHS specialist\nrequested confirmation of safety plan with additional measures\nand RC agreed. The plan included Staff 1 not being alone with\nother youth, that he refrain from involvement in physical\nmanagement of youth (unless emergency) and refrain from\ntransporting youth. We were advised that Youth A had been\ntransported to the Emergency Department for assessment.

OM also contacted Staff 3 and\nadvised that Youth A reported being assaulted by a staff. He\nstated he did not have additional information but proceeded to\ncontact the mother of Youth A to advise that he had been in an\naltercation. He also reported calling CA, who was already aware\nof the incident. He recalled arriving at work the next day at 7:30\nam, reviewed the video and spoke with Youth A. He reported that\nYouth A advised that he and Staff 1 were “going back and forth” in\nthe classroom and that Staff 1 made threats to his family. He\nstated that Youth A went to resource room to calm down and\nrefocus but stated Staff 1 followed and they began to wrestle each\nother. He reported seeing Youth A the day after the incident\noccurred and he did not seem to be in any distress, nor observe\nany injuries. Staff 3 reported that Youth A stated he did not\ninitially report the issue because it “wasn’t an issue”.

It escalated into a war of words and Youth A\nreported making insults toward Staff 1 also. OM reported that as\nsoon as he watched the video he knew it was inappropriate, but\ndid not suspect it to be abuse or neglect and therefore did not\nreport it as such. OM stated that nothing about the incident was\n“appropriate” and that no part of what occurred is within the\ntraining guidelines. OM stated that he can’t justify the actions\ntaken by Staff 1 and as professionals, they should not ever be\nputting their hands on kids like that. DHHS specialist expressed\nsome concern regarding the assessed lack of appropriate\nresponse or actions taken by Highfield staff. OM replied that there\nwas some difficulty in the response due to CA being out sick and\nnot onsite.\nOn 12/21/2023 DHHS specialist and I spoke with OM again at\nHighfields.
