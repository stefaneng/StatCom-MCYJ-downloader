    "ALLEGATION:\nThe agency is not financially stable.\nINVESTIGATION:\nChief Administrator X was interviewed virtually via a Teams meeting on 2/3/2022 by\nArea Manager T and I. We discussed financial concerns for the agency as\ndocumented/outlined by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services\n(MDHSS) Audit and Review Section’s reviews of Homes for Black Children’s (HBC)\nfiscal year 12/31/2017 to 2020.\nChief Administrator X reported HBC addressed the concerns related to the\nDepartment’s audit of HBC’s Foster Care Program and Cost Reporting for\n10/01/2016, through 12/31/2018 via a corrective action plan. She reported the plan\nthey put forth indicated they would have a reserve. She reported a part of the plan\nwas to increase their child placement numbers. She said the agency is looking to\nhire two more foster care workers to enable an increase in placement numbers. She\nsaid, they are no longer worried about whether they can pay payroll; that the\nagency’s finances are getting better. She expressed concerns that the department is\nnot taking the corrective action HBC submitted into consideration. She reported it\nwas true the agency owed funds to the department, due to overpayments; but those\nfunds were repaid. She reported the funds were reimbursed to MDHHS by way of\nthe state recouping the owed funds from foster care and adoption payments due to\nthe agency. Chief Administrator X reported if she felt it was not possible to improve\nthe agency’s financial stability, she would say so.\nChief Administrator X reported the agency is current with its lease, utilities, taxes,\nand other agency financial obligations. Chief Administrator X was asked to provide\nproof of being current with these obligations, however she failed to do so. On\n3/9/2022 she provided a “Homes for Black Children Financial Instability Complaint”\nletter and other documents to show that the agency was doing better financially with\nrespect to what the Department had reported related to the agency’s finances.\nBelow is a summary of the Homes for Black Children Financial Instability Complaint\nletter, and the “Homes for Black Children’s Notes to Financial Statements\n(Continued) for the Years Ended December 31,2020 and 2019”, page 11, submitted\nby Chief Administrator X:\nHomes for Black Children Financial Instability Complaint Letter (authored by\nthe chief administrator);\nThis letter is signed by Chief Administrator X as the president, and indicated:\n• On March 17, 2021, HBC submitted a corrective action plan to the Auditor\nGeneral’s office regarding its 2017 and 2018 onsite audit findings.\n• In advance of the Auditor General’s findings HBC had made considerable\nprogress toward solution of the stated concerns in the listed areas. The\nfollowing was a summary of the those submitted responses:\n5",
    "➢ Eliminated all non-essential positions, and reduced salary expenses by\napproximately $85,000.\n➢ Created a reserve fund equal to one month’s expenses to cover cash flow\nduring the services rendered and services paid cycle.\n➢ Eliminated voluntary loans from staff to cover cash flow.\n➢ Reduced overpayments to the State of Michigan by $37,000.\n➢ Remaining current on all foster care payments.\n➢ Eliminated excessive legal and bank fees.\n➢ Elimination of Independent audit delays. The 2019-18 audit was submitted\nprior to the due date.\n➢ Reorganization of accounting system.\n➢ As of 3/9/2022 HBC continues to make progress in assuring it’s financial\nstability.\n• HBC continues to make progress and remains compliant in the following\nareas of financial stability:\n➢ All Foster Care payments to Foster Families remain current.\n➢ Staff salaries, federal and state deposits remain current.\n➢ The overpayment to the State of $138,629.10 has been repaid; the\nagency overpaid and is due a refund in the amount of $7,072.15.\n➢ Despite considerable lags between services rendered and services paid,\nat the closing of the agency’s financial records for the calendar year 2021,\nHBC had a net income(surplus) of $72,486.24\n➢ HBC’s audit requirement for 2020-19 was submitted prior to the due date.\n• A reference to Note H, page 11 from its financial statement for the year end\n12/31/2020 and 2019 regarding on-going concern. It quoted this section of\nthat page which spoke to management’s institution of a cost reduction\nprogram, that includes a reduction in labor cost. Additionally, that the agency\nhad instituted more efficient management techniques and it was believed\nthose factors would contribute toward agency profitability.\nHome for Black Children’s Notes to Financial Statements for the Years Ended\nDecember 31,2020 and 2019, submitted by Chief administrator:\n• This page is titled “Note H- Going Concern Issues Arising from Deficits in Net\nAssets and Cash Flow Problems.\n• The information on this page stated “As shown in the accompanying financial\nstatements the organization had a deficit in net assets in the amount of $906,753\nas of December 31, 2020, and $732,939 as of December 31,2019. Its current\nliabilities exceeded its current assets in the amount of $922,660 as of December\n31,2020 and $789,664 as of December 31, 2019. These factors raise substantial\ndoubt about the Organizations’ ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement has instituted a cost reduction program that included a reduction in\nlabor cost. In addition, the Organization has instituted more efficient management\ntechniques. Management believes these factors will contribute toward achieving\n6",
    "profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any\nadjustments that might be necessary if the organization is unable to continue as\na going concern. Funding was impacted by a reduction in services related to\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Crisis.”\nChief Administrator X also provided copies of:\n• HBC’s 2021 Sales, Use and Withholding Taxes Annual Return; and form 941\nEmployer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Returns for 2021(January- March; April –\nJune; July -September; October-December) and 2020(July-September) showing\nits wages, tips and other compensations, total deposits and refundable credits;\nand total taxes after adjustments. These totals ranged between $126,742.88 and\n$138,100.09 related to wages/compensations: and $34,452.67 to $39,9 44.77 for\ntotal taxes/adjustments. The significance of these documents with respect to\nHBC’s financial stability is not clear to me.\n• HBC’s schedule of payments for over payment to the Department, showing\ncheck payments to the Department from 7/24/2020 to 12/7/2021. Also, the\nState’s interception of payments from the agency for 12/24/2020; 12/16/2021;\n1/3/2022 and 1/19/2022. The schedule showed a $7,072.15 balance due.\n• Pages 1- 3 of an HBC “Profit & Loss January through December 2021 document.\nIt was not indicated where or from what report these pages are from. The pages\nshowed:\n➢ $754, 708.37 Foster Care Income from the State of Michigan.\n➢ $69, 592.39 from Counseling Unit income; and other income from PPP\nLoan Grant- Part #2, Insurance claim.\n➢ Other income as $1,016,783.02. It showed, after salaries, taxes, fringe\nbenefits, office, and administrative costs, the had a net Income of $72,\n486.24.\n• A voucher/warrant showing four payments to HBC: (12/16/2021,\n12/24/2021,12/30/2021,1/19/2022) for $62,360.40.\nIn addition to the documents provided by Chief Administrator X, I reviewed a MDHHS\nBureau of Audit Division Foster Care Program Audit for HBC for the period October 1,\n2016- September 30, 2018, which was issued and provided to HBC on 4/30/2021; a\nMarch 4, 2021, and February 4, 2022, Memorandum from the MDHHS Audit Division;\nand HBC’s 2021 Statement of Activities Operation budget for 2021. I also reviewed an\nemail statement from the MDHHS Financial Audit Manager of his review of the 3/9/2022\ndocuments HBC provided for this investigation. Below is a summary of the content of\nthose documents; and the MDHHS Financial Audit Manager’s email statement:\nFoster Care Program Audit the period October 1, 2016- September 30, 2018:\nThis audit documented six “Exceptions” (financial concerns); recommendations; and the\nagency’s comments and proposed corrective action plan for the specific exception\nindicated. The specific exception/concern and the corrective action plan indicated by\nHBC is listed below:\n7",
    "Exception 1-Lack of Fiscal Stability and timely audit completion and reporting:\nThis exception indicated: During the reporting period (2016-2018) three of the four\nprior financial audits were not within required timeframes. Additionally, the\nindependent auditor issued a going concern opinion for the four prior audits (2016-\n2019). “A going concern opinion indicates the independent auditor believes there is\nsubstantial doubt the entity will be able to continue in the future.”\n• 2016 audit was 2 years past due; total liabilities exceeded total assets by\n$1,091,359.\n• 2017 audit was 1 year past due; total liabilities exceeded total assets by\n$1,178.534.\n• 2018 audit was 1 year past due; total liabilities exceeded total assets by $635,\n372.\n• 2019 total liabilities exceeded total assets by $732,939.\n• Accounting irregularities in the form of undocumented employee to employer\nloans were identified totaling $52,773 to cover cash short fall during 2017 and\n2018. This practice was denoted as financially risky for both parties and\nexposed the agency to additionally liabilities.\n• During the review it was noted that in 2018 HBC incurred $43,534 for bank\nfees and penalties; $41,642 for tax resolution and preparation; $1,475 for\nbank overdrafts fees; and $417 for insufficient funds/returned item fees.\nHBC’s Corrective Action Plan to Exception 1 to be completed by 4/26/2021 was that:\nThe agency would discontinue accepting staff loans. Cash flow concerns had been\nmitigated by development of a reserve fund. An overall reduction in wages and\nsalaries would be utilized to reduce overall operating loss. The agency anticipated\nan increase in agency revenue, after the pandemic, via fund raising and purchase of\nservice contracts.\nException 2- Reported Salaries and Wages Exceed Amounts Paid:\nThis exception indicated: The costs reported for salaries were greater than actual\nexpenditures in the financial accounting system and resulted in an overstatement of\nreported direct expenses by $122,183, This resulted in unallowed costs reported to\nMDHHS on the CPA’s fiscal year (FY)17 Cost Report.\nHBC’s Corrective Action Plan to Exception 2 to be completed by 4/26/2021 was that:\nAll data collected for the preparation of the cost report would be the responsibility of\nthe agency’s accountant. All outstanding checks would be voided and canceled after\n90-days of authorization. Program managers of each department will validate the\nauthenticity of the information, and the Chief Executive Officer, along with the\nleadership team (Accountant, Foster Care Program Manager and Resources\nProgram Manager) will review the report before its submission.\nException 3-Payments to Foster Care Families Not Made in Timely Fashion:\nThis exception indicated: During the review the auditor noted HBC did not pay foster\ncare families for services in a timely fashion. Seven out of 28 (25%) sample\n8",
    "payments showed foster families were paid six months or later after the initiation of\nservices. Two of the 28 were paid more than one year after services were initiated.\nContact was attempted with 22 foster families. Contact was made with 10 (45%)\nwho reported HBC was up to date on their payments. Timely payment to the other\n12 foster families was unable to be verified.\nHBC’s Corrective Action Plan to Exception 3 to be completed by 4/30/2021 was that:\nThe agency commented that all payment were current. That a one-month reserve\nhas been created to assure timely foster parent board and care payments.\nException 4- Foster Care Board and Care Expense Reported in Wrong Year:\nThis exception indicated: During the review 11 of 28 (39%) Foster Care Board and\nCare expenses selected for testing were incurred prior to FY18 but payments were\nrecorded in FY18 and reported on the FY18 cost report. This audit found that\n$29,353 was reported on the FY18 report when it should have been reported in\nyears prior to FY18.\nHBC’s Corrective Action Plan to Exception 4 to be completed by 11/30/2020 was\nthat:\nThe accountant would be responsible for preparing the cost report. The accountant\nhas received additional training in cost reporting and will review the State of\nMichigan Cost Report training manual prior to preparation of the report. The\nProgram Manager of each department will validate the authenticity of the\ninformation, and the Chief Executive Officer, along with the leadership team will\nreview the report before its submission.\nException 5- Foster Care Board and Care Payments Not Made:\nThis exception indicated: Of the 28 payments to foster families in FY18 reported on\nthe agency’s cost report as expenses, there was no evidence that eight (29%) of the\nchecks, $37,301, were cashed; per review of the agency’s FY18 bank statements.\nAlso, a check stub of one of the eight payments showed a 10/13/2019 issuance\ndate, which was after the audit work commenced. HBC reported that check should\nhave been voided.\nHBC’s Corrective Action Plan to Exception 5 to be completed by 6/28/2020 was that:\nMISACWIS information would determine which family is to be paid for foster board\nand care each month.\nException 6- Documentation Related to Service Dates Did Not Reconcile with\nMDHHS Records:\nThis exception indicated: During the review it was noted that HBC provided\ndocumentation related to service dates on four of eight (50%) payments to foster\nfamilies that did not reconcile to the service dates recorded in MISACWIS. On one\noccasion the documentation showed service dates from 4/1/2017 until 11/30/2017.\nHowever, MISACWIS showed the services dates did not start until 9/29/2018. In the\nother three instances, HBC showed service dates taking place during FY18, while\n9",
    "MISACWIS detailed service dates occurring prior to FY18, with services as early as\nFY12. This resulted in HBC including costs incurred outside of the required\nreporting period on the FY18 Cost Report\nHBC’s Corrective Action Plan to Exception 6 to be completed by 12/31/2020 was\nthat:\nAll foster care census and payment authorization data would be obtained through\nMIASCWIS and reconciled to agency records by the accountant. Monthly census\ndata would be provided to the accountant.\nThis Foster Care Program Audit for October 1, 2016- September 30, 2018\nrecommended that HBC implement an adequate internal control system over financial\nreporting that provides reasonable assurance that financial reports are supported by\naccounting records.\nMarch 4, 2021, and February 4, 2022, Memorandums from the MDHHS Audit\nReview Section (ARS)\nThese Memorandums were for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, to 2019 and\nDecember 31, 2020. The purpose of the review was to monitor contract compliance and\nfollow up on any audit disclosures which could negatively impact MDHHS funding. Both\nARS reviews reported several financial risk factors.\nThe ARS review reported the annual MDHHS funds payment to the HBC as listed\nbelow:\nFiscal Year Total Adoption, Foster Care\nPlacing, and Child Care\nFunds=\n2017 $975,060\n2018 $729,891\n2019 $792,587\n2020 $751,763\n10",
    "The ARS financial audit reports from fiscal years 2017- 2019, and 2020 denoted:\nFYE 12/31/2017-2019 FYE 12/31/2020\nAudit Review Audit Review\nDecline in Total Net Assets- Homes for Black Children Homes for Black\nNet assets indicate the extent to had a deficit in total net Children had a deficit\nwhich revenues exceed expenses assets of 15.36% for the in total net assets of\nand is an indicator of the financial FYE 12/31/2019. 11.86% for the FYE\nhealth of an organization 12/31/2020.\nThe total decrease in net The total decrease in\nassets for the past four net assets for the past\nyears is a negative four years is a\n($563,903) negative ($819,849)\nDeficit of Unrestricted Net Assets.

    "HBC’s 2021 Statement of Activities Operation’s budget for 2021 showed.\nRevenue Source of\nGovern/Agencies $900,552.00\nDonation/Interest $15,000.00\nTotal Expenditure $915,552.00\nExcess Revenue $256.40\nMDHHS Financial Audit Manager’s review of the 3/9/2022 documents provided\nby HBC:\nThe Financial Audit Manager indicated the package of information does not\nconstitute an independent financial statement audit. Additionally, that it showed\n“they are making progress with a $72k surplus for 2021 activity; but from reading\n“Note H” from the 2020 audit which they included in the package, the auditor still\nclassified HBC as a “going concern” and notes that they have substantial debt\ngreater than $900k.” That “a quick and simple assumption based on the information\nthey provided would be that HBC didn’t take on any additional liabilities in 2021, and\nthe best case is they would reduce their overall debt by that $72k surplus. However,\nthey would still owe roughly $850k. If that is the case, I fully anticipate an\nindependent audit would classify HBC as a going concern, again. Unfortunately, a\nlarge deficit and classification as a going concern does not indicate good financial\nstanding.”\nDuring this investigation, between 3/18/2022 and 3/21/2022, I also spoke with four\nagency staff persons (Staff 1- 4, one of whom was Agency Accountant XX), and four\nfoster parent/caregivers (Foster Parent/Caregiver A-D). All four employees reported\nbeing paid by the agency via check every two weeks. Neither employee reported\never having an agency paycheck to be late or to bounce. Nor had they ever not\nreceived a paycheck. One employee reported a knowledge of past financial issues\nfor the agency but reported that was three or four years ago. This employee also\nacknowledged they had received calls from a couple of caregivers inquiring about\ntheir board and care payments, but that was one to two years ago.\nStaff 4/Agency Accountant XX also acknowledged the agency had experienced\nfinancial woes across the board with paying its accounts about four years ago. The\naccountant reported the agency has been getting better financially with incomes and\nrevenues over the last one to two years. He reported the agency is current on all its\nfinancial obligations; that there are no deficits at this time. He reported one concern\nis that MDHHS is still paying slowly. He reported the agency has borrowed from\nbanks from time to time; and took out a small business loan, due to COVID/ to avoid\n12",
    "laying off staff, but have not had to take any loans of late. He reported no current\nfinancial concerns related to the agency’s financial status. He reported the agency\nas having a $72,000 surplus at the end of last year. He anticipates a large surplus\nthis year. But despite the surplus they will still be in substantial debt.\nOf the four-foster parents/caregivers interviewed, all reported being paid in the\ncurrent month for the past month’s care to the foster child. Neither reported any late,\nmissed, or bounced foster care payment checks. Neither of these foster\nparents/caregivers had concerns about the agency being able to pay. Only one of\nthese foster parents/caregivers had heard of possible agency financial problems.\nThis foster parent/caregiver reported hearing from a friend, who was a former\nagency foster parent, that the agency does not pay timely. That prior foster parent\nhad stated, “you’ll never get your money”; but this foster parent/caregiver stated,\n“they never did that me”, meaning the agency had paid them their funds.\nAfter initial completion of this report additional information was received from\nthe agency and assessed to better understand and clarify financial information\nthey reported.\nOn 6/2/2022 the following information was received:\nChief Administrator X was asked to clarify:\na. The root cause of the huge difference between the agency’s assets and\nliabilities. To provide an explanation of this difference, how it occurred,\nwhich respect to looking at how this may prevent future occurrence.\nb. What is the concrete plan to bring down the liabilities? What will the\nagency do with its reported $72k surplus at the end of 2021. Will all, some,\nmost of it be used to pay down debt?.\nc. Are there other sources of revenue HBC plans to get to pay down the\nagency’s debts? If so, how quickly will that occur?\nd. What is the agency’s total debts/ liabilities owed in 2020; 2021 and now?\nChief Administrator X did not exactly address each point, but reported the following\nrelated to these questions:\n• Cost saving measures, were instituted as the independent auditor\nreferenced in his report Note G.\n• In 2020, the agency restructured by:\n1. Eliminating all non-essential staff (secretarial, administrative, etc.)-\n{To what number Chief Administrator X did not report}.\n2. Reducing employee benefits. {To what degree Chief Administrator\nX did not report}.\n3. Eliminating non-MDHHS funded support programs (e.g., agency\nfunded life enrichment activities, agency funded parent partner and\nmentoring programs). Previously these programs were funded\nthrough time limited grants and reduction in support from United\nWay.\n13",
    "4. Restructuring the adoption program by reducing adoption goals and\nelimination of the adoption parent support program. For many\nyears HBC’s adoption program was not cost neutral and over the\nyears created a liability. This was a significant factor in the\naccumulation of a deficit.\n5. Decreasing operational expenses. {To what degree Chief\nAdministrator X did not report}.\n• In 2020 HBC’s liabilities were decreased by $6,603; and by $55,021 in\n2021. HBC believes this trend will continue and overtime will eliminate\nthe agency’s liabilities.\n• The agency will also utilize non-designated donations to reduce overall\nliabilities.\nChief Administrator X reported the items listed in items 1- 5 above were completed by\n4/26/2021. She reported HBC’s liabilities were, $623.005 in 2019; $616,402 in 2020;\nand $561,380 in 2021.\nOn 7/11/2022, during an onsite agency visit, I met with Chief Administrator X, and briefly\nwith Agency Accountant XX related to this special investigation. I advised them that the\ninformation they have provided our department thus far still does not address all the\nissues related to their financial stability (i.e., all debts owed, proof foster\nparent/caregiver payments are being made timely, mortgage/rent and utility payments\nowed/paid and the current financial standing on those). I again requested specific\ndocuments, lease payments, utilities bills and other debts/ payments, and to whom the\n$561,000 -plus amount is owed; as well as the status of that debt and what are the\npayments arrangements for that debt.\nDuring this onsite visit, Chief Administrator X verbally reported:\n• $20,000 is owed related to back lease payments, and they pay $650 monthly on\nthat arrearage.\n• They are up to date on their current lease payments.\n• Their electricity, telephone, and gas is included in their lease payment.\n• $150,000 is owed on a small business administration (SBA) loan that they pay\n$654 per month.\n• The agency remains current with foster care payments to foster parents/relatives\nand staff payroll.\n• As for the rest of the debt it’s an “old/bad debt”. She reported it has been\nresolved but remains on the books. She reported a desire to speak with counsel\nto determine whether to disclose who the old debt is owed. She reported the\ndebt goes back to around 2015 or 2016. That that debt came about after United\nWay stopped providing funds- which used to offset their adoption services (these\nfundings stop some time in 2013-2014).\n• The agency agrees to provide a random sampling of the foster care and staff\npayroll payments; and a written break down of the things Chief Administrator X\n14",
    "reported, inclusive of a copy of their lease agreement/payments; and information\nrelated to the $150,000 SBA loan/debt.\n• Again, that she believes the agency is making financial gains. She reported after\ntheir annual financial audit, that is due by September 2022, it will show these\ngains.\n• Chief Administrator X reported via email on 7/14/2022, that “the SBA loan was\ntaken out in 2020 for 149,900 with a thirty-year repayment in the amount of\n641.00 monthly beginning July 2022.”\nOn 7/14 /2022, 7/21/2022; then 8/26/2022 (following a written request from the DCWL\ndirector) documents listed below were received:\n1. HBC’s Lease for the building address the agency is licensed for, that showed:\n• The lease was made on 9/1/2021 with Southwest Housing Solution Corporation\nfor five years, ending 2026. With an ability to extend three additionally year, if not\nin default.\n• The agency is to pay an annual lease payment in the sum of $71,280, that is\npayable monthly in the amount of $5,940.\n• The landlord shall provide utilities for the office’s common area, that includes\nelectricity, heat, air-conditioning and ventilation. Additionally, the landlord shall be\nresponsible for water and sewage.\n• The agency shall be responsible for electric and gas servicing on the first-floor\npremises. Additionally, the agency shall obtain and keep public liability insurance.\nWith respect to the above additional documents, the agency did not provide\ndocumentation showing whether their lease payments are current. Chief Administrator X\nhad previously indicated $20,000 was owed in back rent; and no further documentation\nwas provided related to that. Nor was documentation provided related to whether the\nagency has electricity, or gas services in its name, and if so, the status of such service\npayments.\n2. A 1/1/2022- 7/13/2022 Foster parent check payment register for seven caregivers\n(Caregiver # E-K), that I had randomly selected from the agency’s Foster Care List\nof placements on 7/11/2022. The payments indicated:\n• Respective payment days for each on either 1/15/2022; 2/15/2022; 3/15/2022,\n4/15/2022 5/13/2022, 6/15/2022 and or 6/23/2022.\n• A total payment of $3,244.68 for caregiver #E; $6,489.36 for Caregiver # F;\n$6,179.07 for Caregiver #G; $8,462.75 for Caregiver #H; $4,630.44 for Caregiver\n#I; $4,624.01 for Caregiver # J; and $6,488.40 for Caregiver #K.\nWith respect to the payments listed above I attempted to verify this information in\nMISACWIS but was unable to determine/verify each exact amount.\n3. Employer Quarter Federal Tax Return Forms 941 for 2022 for the first and second\nquarter of 2022 which showed:\n15",
    "• Total wages, tips, and other compensation as $138.835.43 for January- March\n2022.\n• Total wages, tips and other compensation as $142,489.26 for April-June 2022.\n4. A copy of HBC’s Loan authorization agreement related to the $150,000 SBA loan;\nwith a statement from Administrator X that indicated:\n• “In its capacity as a government agency, having reviewed our financials and\ntax returns, and finding us credit worthy, the SBA approved and funded a loan\nto the agency for 150,000. The term of the loan is thirty years. Although\npayments are deferred until 30 months following the funding (January 2023),\nwe began to make payments last September (2021) in the amount of 641.00\nmonthly. I am awaiting a statement from our landlord.”\n5. A copy of HBC’s Internal Control Procedures which showed:\n• The chief administrator’s duties and the Accountant’s duties outlined.\n6. A copy of the agency’s bank statement from January 2022 to July 2022.\n• Chief Administrator X reported the August 2022 statement has not been\nissued.\n• Checks and noted balances were indicated in the back statements, but I\ncannot discern these documents representation of the agency’s overall\nfinancial stability.\n7. A copy of a 6/24/202 letter from Tax Consultant Y to Tax Representative Z related to\nsubmission of a tax form 12257 for HBC. A copy of the 12257 form, dated 7/2/2020\nwas included with this letter.\n8. A copy of a 7/7/2020 Internal Revenue Service (IRS)- Independent Office of Appeal\nfrom Tax Representative Z to HBC.\n• Administrator X indicated a statement about the documents. She indicated\nthat the debt owed by the agency (payables) is for unpaid tax assessments\nincurred in 2018 and 2019. That the IRS letter indicates that HBC is “current\nwith taxes and the remaining debt is not collectable”.\n• Per the IRS letter, it indicated the tax matter related to HBC’s 941 form for\n6/2018, 9/2018, 12/2018, 3/2019 and 6/2019, RE: Due Process-Levy\n• This IRS letter indicated advisement to HBC related to an appeal agreement\nreached. It indicated “The Service”:\n➢ Will temporarily suspend collection of the balance owed on HBC’s\naccount.\n➢ Will periodically ask HBC to send updated financial information as well\nas monitor HBC’s account to determine if HBC can pay in the future.\n➢ Will have the discretion to remove HBC’s account from suspension.\n16",
    "➢ That “penalty and interest will continue to increase(accrue) while\ncollection action is suspended.”\n➢ That HBC’s form 12257(Summary Notice of Determination) indicating\nthat HBC agrees with the summary determination and waives its right\nto judicial review of the summary determination and suspension of\nlevy under the tax code is approved.\nThe Department continued discussions with Chief Administrator X and program\nrepresentatives to further assess their financial situation. On 11/18/22, a meeting was\nheld with the program, and they proposed that within the next 30-60 days, it will:\n• Have a designated/qualified individual (MD) (pro bono) who will prepare and draft\na detailed analysis and recommendation to the HBC board of directors of\nsuggestions to create financial stability\n• Change payroll from Intuit to a third-party vendor, e.g., ADP\n• Appoint a different internal auditor\n• Develop and fill positions for a Finance and Audit committee within the HBC\nBoard of Directors\n• Develop repayment plan for the $211,297.73 owed to MDHHS\nOn 12/02/22, the Department representative reported the following to the DCWL\nDirector and the MDHHS Bureau Director related to the IRS collection of debt for this\nprogram:\nI met with a couple of the T&R AAGs this morning and they agree with my\nassessment of the IRS’ placement of HBC on CNC status:\n(1) the IRS did not forgive HBC’s income tax debt but instead, it agreed to\ngenerally not try to collect from HBC by levying HBC’s income and assets,\n(2) the debt remains owed to the IRS and is collectible,\n(3) the IRS will assess interest and penalties,\n(4) the IRS can continue to ask HBC to provide financial information to re-assess\nthis status,\n(5) after reviewing HBC’s finances annually, the IRS may collect this debt if\nHBC’s financial situation improves, and\n(6) the IRS may collect these owed taxes up to 10 years after they were\nassessed (the tax periods are 6/2018, 9/2018, 12/2018, 03/2019, and 06/2019).\nThus, the IRS employment tax debt may become collectible in the future,\nespecially should HBC increase its income and revenue sources as advised in\nour 11/18/2022 meeting with HBC, et al.\nBased on the 11/18/22 commitments made by the program, on 12/06/22, the\nDepartment requested from the program’s representative that the program confirm that\nno later than COB on 1/17/2023 (60 days from our 11/18/2022 meeting), HBC will\nprovide a detailed written plan to DCWL which includes addressing/providing the\nfollowing:\n17",
    "• A copy of MD’s (pro bono) detailed analysis and recommendation to the HBC\nboard of directors of suggestions to create financial stability.\n• Proof that payroll is being handled by a third-party vendor, e.g., ADP.\n• The name and contact information of a different internal auditor of HBC.\n• Bylaws, governing rules, board of directors’ position descriptions, etc. verifying\nthe development of positions for a Finance and Audit Committee within the HBC\nBoard of Directors, including the names of the members filling this committee and\ntheir related experience applicable to their positions.\n• Repayment/recoupment of HBC’s outstanding balance of $211,297.73 owed to\nMDHHS for the 2014 and 2015 advancement payments: and\n• IRS employment tax repayment plan should the IRS change HBC’s status from\nCNC to collectible.”\nOn 12/19/2022, the Department representative provided an update to the DCWL\nDirector that indicated she spoke with the program’s representative on 12/19/2022 and\nhe advised that HBC is working through and making progress toward their outlined\ncommitments. Specifically, it was reported that HBC is looking to commit to spending\nmoney for an external payroll service and independent auditor and is developing\nFinance/Audit and Fundraising Committees and making inquiries to community\nmembers who may be able to assist with these.\nA document, dated 01/17/2023, was sent by the program’s representative to the\nDepartment’s representative, and provided updates to the action items that were agreed\nupon at the 11/18/22 meeting. The document included numerous Exhibits as\nattachments for reference, including the agency’s Finance and Audit Committee\nCharter, Proposal to Provide Audit and Tax Services from GJC, Contract for Services\nwith ADP, Authorized Representative Declaration, BHC By-Laws, HBC Board Member\nExpectations, HBC Finance Committee, HBC Fund Development Committee,\nGovernance Committee for HBC, HBC Resolution Calling For implementing\nRecommendations of MD, Information on MD, Resume of a CPA, Information on\nanother financial representative, HBD Board of Director’s Bio Statements. In summary,\nthe document reports the following as related to the identified commitments per the\nDepartment’s representative:\n• A copy of MD’s report was provided and dated 01/13/2023. The report provided\nrecommendations for improved practices in the areas of Governance, Financial\nand Operational Management, Fund Development, and Succession Planning but\ndid not offer his own opinion about the effect of HBC’s IRS employment tax debt\n(designated by the IRS as currently not collectable (CNC) status) on the financial\nstability of this agency. Instead, he deferred to the agency’s law firm’s advice of\nthe liability which “appears to now be stable and this liability might very well be\nconsidered a long-term or contingent liability, as opposed to a liability that would\nbe due in the near-term or on demand.\n• Proof that payroll is being handled by a third-party vendor was provided via\ncontract between the agency and ADP, dated 01/10/2023.\n18",
    "• The name and contact information of a different internal auditor of HBC was\nprovided via an “engagement letter” from GJC (George Johnson & Company)\nthat was a “proposal to provide professional services to HBC” and a “proposal for\nprofessional services”, however, an engagement letter was not provided. It is\nnotable that further documentation provided included documentation that HBC’s\nBoard of Directors held a virtual meeting on January 16, 2023, and their votes\napproved “retaining George Johnson & Company – CPAs to serve as HBC’s\nexternal auditor for 2023 and beyond.”\n• Bylaws, governing rules, board of directors’ position descriptions, etc. verifying\nthe development of positions for a Finance and Audit Committee within the HBC\nBoard of Directors, including the names of the members filling this committee and\ntheir related experience applicable to their positions. The document included an\nExhibit D, HBC’s by-laws, and the Board resolution of creating a new Financial\nAudit committee, as Exhibit E. Although, on January 16, 2023, HBC passed\nseveral resolutions, it appears HBC has not taken full advantage of the 60 days\nthey requested MDHHS grant them. HBC’s response does not contain specificity\nnor address the steps HBC will take to form a search committee to form the\nBoard’s subcommittee’s – such as the Compliance and Risk Committee and an\nExecutive Compensation Committee. Thus, HBC failed to provide concrete steps\nof how and when they will achieve these goals.\n• Repayment/recoupment of HBC’s outstanding balance of $211,297.73 owed to\nMDHHS for the 2014 and 2015 advancement payments. This was addressed via\nnarrative from the report and indicated that HBC reports that they have possibly\nrepaid back “substantial funds,” however, HBC failed to account for and identify\nthe amount of repayment. HBC additionally suggested MDHHS has not provided\ntransparency in their accounting of the repayment amounts nor the current\nbalance owed. Since MDHHS has not made collection attempt efforts during the\npast few years, HBC argues MDHHS should forgive the remaining debt owed.\nHBC also suggests that other child placing agencies may have had similar\nagreements and MDHHS has not attempted to collect overdue repayments from\nother agencies, then pursuing debt collection solely against HBC would be\n“unfair” and “create an undue hardship”. And, according to HBC, MDHHS “bears\nas much blame for not pursuing repayment of these debts as any agency for not\nrepaying them.” HBC therefore assumed that MDHHS had determined not to see\nrepayment of any obligation under these agreements. HBC additionally\nrequested to continue discussion with the Department regarding this matter and\nproposed to pay $1000 per month at most, if the law requires HBC to repay the\ndept.\n• IRS employment tax repayment plan should the IRS change HBC’s status from\nCNC to collectible. This was addressed via narrative from the report and noted\nthat while in CNC (Currently Not Collectable) status, HBC acknowledged that the\nIRS debt could be collected and that after 10 years “the IRS will be foreclosed\nfrom seeking repayment of the debt” but opines this is unlikely to occur. HBC’s\n19",
    "proposed remedy to address this possibility – or eventuality should HBC become\nfinancially solvent – is to enter an installment payment and/or the “community is\naware of the IRS debt and remains willing to assist if ever it becomes necessary.”\nHBC is “confident that the IRS debt will never interrupt its ability to deliver any\nrequired services.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12202 Policy and procedures.\nAn agency shall have and follow written policies and procedures\nfor all of the following:\n(a)Financial stability.\n20",
    "ANALYSIS: From 2017 to 2020 HBC continued to experience financial\ndeficits in revenue. At the 2019 year end it was ($97,567); and\n2020-year end ($86,908). The agency experienced a net\nincome/ surplus of $72,486.24 at the end of 2021, but there is\nsome question as to whether that surplus is a realistic net\nincome when off-set by what may be owed by the agency. To\nthat end, financial stability concerns continue. It should be noted\nhere they are $900k in debt despite these year-end numbers.\nIn 2020 the agency restructured and instituted various cost\nsaving measures to reduce its liabilities. It made reductions in\nits liabilities by $6,603 in 2020; and $55,021 in 2021.\nNotwithstanding those annual reductions, the agency reports a\ncontinued liability of $561,380 as of 2021.\nAdditionally, information provided by the agency showed the\nagency owed back lease payments in the amount of $20,000; a\n$149,000- $150,000 small business loan, other expenses that\nare unable to be clearly assessed; and the old debt impact as\nreferenced above.\nThe agency has demonstrated progress toward some\nenhancements in their accounting practices and has established\na plan to improve their financial stability as outlined in the\ncommitments made to the Department. There remains,\nhowever, incomplete action toward completion of those\ncommitments established to remedy the concerns noted in this\ninvestigation.\nBased on the ongoing concerns expressed in the audits and\ncontinued deficit liabilities issues, the agency does not\ndemonstrate financial stability as required by this rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUp receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan modification of the license to a first\nprovisional license is recommended.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date 10/13/2022\nLicensing Consultant\n21",
