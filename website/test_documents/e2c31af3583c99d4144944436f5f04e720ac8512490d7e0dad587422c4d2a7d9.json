INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Sufficiency of staff.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126\nSection The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for\nthe continual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth J was hit by a car while trying to AWOL during an outing.\nInvestigation Documents reviewed:\nMISACWIS indicates Youth J, was placed in Wolverine Center’s\nEmergency Shelter on 1/20/24 and still had not been permanently\nplaced as of 2/27/24. Wolverine Shelter is his first out of home\nplacement.\nI visually observed Youth J’s psychotropic medications. He\ncurrently is prescribed Depakote, Abilify, Trazodone, Xanex and a\nform of Adderall.\nHospital emergency room discharge instructions dated 2/28/24\ndiagnosed Youth J with Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.\nHospital emergency room discharge instructions dated 2/28/24\ndiagnosed Youth N with Adjustment Disorder.\nAn incident report by Staff 1 dated 2/27/24 at 6:45pm was\nconsistent with the information she reported when interviewed.\nInterviews:\nI notified Youth J’s Foster Care Worker of this investigation\nassignment, and she expressed no licensing concerns regarding\nWolverine Center.\nI contacted Complainant/Youth J’s Grandmother. She said Youth\nJ’s mother called her hollering and screaming worried about Youth\nJ. “He’s incompetent and they won’t tell nobody where he is at.” I\nencouraged Complainant to contact Youth J’s foster care worker\n2",
    "for more information. Complainant agreed to contact the foster\ncare worker and expressed no additional licensing concerns\nregarding Wolverine Center.\nI notified Chief Administrator (CA) via phone of the allegations.\nShe was aware of the incident but was not aware an investigation\nwas initiated. CA reported Youth J was not hit by a car but said\nhe did run into the road. CA said Youth J was not physically\ninjured but was taken to the hospital for a psychiatric crisis\nassessment afterward.\nI interviewed Youth J, onsite on 3/1/24. He presented with a dull\naffect, had difficulty remembering his birthdate, and appeared\nmuch younger than his age. Wolverine Center is his first\nplacement outside of his parents’ home. Youth J said he has\n“outbursts” during which he throws chairs and has been\nhospitalized twice for suicidal ideations. I asked Youth J if he\nbroke a van window. He nodded and said he did it because he\nwas leaving the park and did not want to leave. He wanted to go\nhome (to his parents). I asked if he was hit by a car and Youth J\nshook his head “no.” However, he did admit he intentionally ran in\nfront of a car “because I wanted to end myself.” I asked why he\nwanted to end himself, Youth J shrugged, “just upset.” Afterward\nhe said he was seen at a hospital. The hospital staff asked him\nquestions and sent him back to the facility.\nI interviewed Youth N, at school on 3/5/24. His affect was dull,\nspeech was slow, and he was unable to provide details of events\nin chronological sequence. Youth N said he has been at\nWolverine Center for three months and did not want to talk about\nanything. I asked what happened on the outing to the park, he\nwas more amenable to talking about Youth J’s behaviors than his\nown. Youth N said Youth J ran away from staff first. “I ran away\ntoo. We were hiding from the cops scared we’d go to jail. A\nfamily said they’d give us money. I scratched paint off a truck.\nYouth J tried jumping out the window. I tried to choke myself. We\nran toward cars. The cops got us. We went to the hospital.”\nYouth N was unwilling or unable to say what caused his behaviors\nand refused to provide any additional information.\nI interviewed Youth R at school on 3/20/24. He said Youth J did\nnot want to leave the park, so he and Youth N ran from staff and\ninto the street. The police came. Inside the van, Youth J broke a\nwindow out and Youth N tried breaking the van door. Youth N\nchoked himself with a seatbelt. “I punched one woman staff in the\n3",
    "chest because Youth J made me mad…The cops came and put\nYouth J in back of the cop car.”\nI interviewed Former Youth D at school on 3/20/24. He was\ndischarged from the facility on 3/5/24. Former Youth D presented\nwith a dull affect and had difficulty focusing on the questions that\nwere asked. He said he recalled Youth J and Youth N ran in the\nstreet at the park and the “staff tried to get them out.” He said the\nboys were not hurt. I asked about the staff at Wolverine Center,\nFormer Youth D nodded “good.” He was unable to remember any\nadditional details regarding the incident at the park.\nI interviewed Staff 1 onsite on 3/5/24. She has only worked at the\nfacility for one month. Staff 1 said she and Staff 2 took four short-\nterm shelter youths to Belle Isle. There is a one-way road around\nits perimeter. Staff 1 stated the youths played football, made new\nfriends, and had fun until it was time to leave the park. Three\nboys were in the van, but Youth J would not get in because he\nwanted to talk to a girl. Youth J ran away from the van, and\neveryone followed him. From a distance he was seen banging on\ngas pipelines and walking into oncoming traffic. Staff 2 ran into\nthe street after Youth J. Then Youth N also walked into oncoming\ntraffic. Neither boy was hit by a car or injured in any way.\nAfter walking toward cars, Youth J and Youth N ran into a field.\nStaff 2 called the police who located the youths and brought them\nback to the van. In the presence of police, a stranger gave each\nof the boys a five- or twenty-dollar bill. Youth N got angry and told\nthe stranger he wanted more money. Staff 3 arrived at the park to\nassist and drove everyone back to the facility, leaving the van they\ncame in at the park. On the ride back, Staff 1 said Youth J kicked\nout a van window because he did not want to leave the park.\nYouth N wrapped a seatbelt around his neck because the stranger\nonly gave him twenty dollars. He bit Staff 2’s hand when she tried\nto remove the seatbelt from his hands. Staff 3 stopped the van\nand called the police again. Youth N and Youth J exited the van\nand walked into traffic again on East Jefferson. Police arrived\nagain and secured the boys. Staff told the police they did not feel\nsafe driving with Youth N and Youth J. Upon return to the facility\nboth youths were transported to the hospital for psychiatric\nevaluations and released back to Wolverine Center.\nI interviewed Former Staff 2 via phone on 3/20/24. She no longer\nworks at the facility and feels she was unjustly terminated for an\nunrelated matter. Former Staff 2 said she was traumatized by the\n4",
    "youths’ behaviors on the outing and was never thanked by\nadministrators for saving the youths’ lives.\nRegarding the incident at the park, Youth J was upset because he\nwanted to stay at the park. He and Youth N ran into the street and\nwould not follow staff directives. “I kept line of sight and called the\npolice. The police found the boys, and both were irate. Youth N\nchoked himself with a seatbelt while Youth J kicked out a window.\nI held onto Youth J so he did not fall out while keeping Youth N\nfrom choking himself. Staff 3 stopped the van. The boys got out\nand ran into East Jefferson. I was able to grab both of them.\nYouth J and Youth N both said they wanted to die. The police had\nfollowed us home from the park and brought both youths back to\nthe facility in their police car.”\nI interviewed Staff 3 via phone on 3/20/24. She was at the facility\nand volunteered to drive to Belle Isle to assist Staff 1 and Staff 2.\nBefore locating her coworkers, she saw a police car and Youth J\nand Youth N running away from police. When the youths were\nsecured, Staff 3 drove everyone in one van back to the facility.\nOn the way back, Youth J broke a window and Staff 2 held him in\nwith his behind sticking out the window. “I pulled over as soon as\npossible. It was dark. Youth J and N hopped out and walked into\ntraffic. Staff 2 retrieved Youth J and I called the police.” The\npolice arrived and drove both youths back in the police car.\nAnalysis Youth J and Youth N intentionally ran into oncoming traffic twice\nduring an outing on 2/27/24. Staff 1 and Staff 2 intervened and\nneither of the boys were injured or hit by a car. The two boys ran\nfrom staff, the police were called, found them and brought them to\nstaff. Staff 2 removed a seatbelt Youth N wrapped around his\nneck. Staff 3 stopped the van for safety and both boys ran into\nthe road again. Police were called again and brought the boys\nback to the van. Upon return to the facility, both boys were taken\nto the emergency room for a psychiatric assessment.\nCONSULTATION\nTo maintain safety of youth in the short-term program, I\nrecommended all short-term shelter youths only attend\nrecreational activities on-grounds and not be eligible for off-\ngrounds activities.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
    "Rule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It was alleged Youth J was \"tortured\" at the facility.\nInvestigation I asked Youth J to tell me about him and other youths being\n“tortured” at the facility. He responded, “They’re not…I just said\nthat in case I’d go home.”\nYouth N also denied that he or anyone else was tortured at the\nfacility.\nYouth R said “Youth J and Youth N lied” that staff abused them.\n“It is not true.”\nYouth D said staff at the facility are “good” and do not hurt youths.\nAnalysis There is no evidence youths are physically punished or tortured at\nthe facility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
