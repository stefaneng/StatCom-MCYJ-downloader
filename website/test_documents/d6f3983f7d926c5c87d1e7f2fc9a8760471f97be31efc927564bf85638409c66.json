    "01/14/2021 Contact - Document Received\nALLEGATION:\nOn 12/11/20, a youth asked staff member for an envelope multiple times and was\ntold no. Youth hit staff member. Three staff members took youth down and placed\nyouth in isolation. Youth has marks and bruises from incident. Youth was released\nfrom isolation 12/16/20 and allowed to make a 5 minute call. Youth has multiple\nmental health issues and has been given medication, but no counseling. Youth was\nalso given unknown injection upon arrival.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn December 17, 2020 DCWL reviewed the complaint as outlined above. I initiated\na special investigation the same day by interviewing Youth A with another DHHS\nWorker by FaceTime. Agency staff and youth were interviewed at the facility.\nDocuments and video of the event were received and reviewed in this investigation.\nWhat follows is information obtained from the aforementioned sources.\nOn December 17, 2020 I interviewed Youth A along with DHHS Worker by\nFaceTime while Youth A was at the facility. Youth A was being released from the\nfacility later in the day. Youth A is a 13-year-old female who has been at Saginaw\nCounty Detention Home since September 2020. Youth A indicated she was aware\nwhy she was being interviewed. Youth A stated it all started by her asking for an\nenvelope. She reported that she asked Staff 1 for an envelope and Staff 1 told her\nto “wait a minute.” Youth A reported she waited ten minutes and asked again. The\nunit was out of envelopes and another staff needed to come back to the unit so Staff\n1 could go get more envelopes. Youth A stated Staff 2 entered the unit and she\nasked him for an envelope and Staff 1 told her she was manipulating. Youth A\nreported that Staff 2 told her to go to her room and Staff 1 said no I am going to put\nher in her room. Youth A stated that is when Staff 2 said she was sizing up Staff 1\nand pushed her into her room. Youth A reported she could not remember where\nStaff 2 placed his hands when he pushed her into her room. Youth A stated she\nreached around Staff 2 and hit Staff 1.\nYouth A reported a behavior management timeout, BMT, refusal was called over the\nradio prior to her being shoved into her room. Youth A stated if a BMT refusal is\ncalled then you have to give up your shoes, bedding and the door is closed and\nlocked. Youth A reported she still had her shoes, and she hid behind the toilet in her\nroom. Youth A reported that staff cannot see you from the window in the door if you\nhide behind the toilet. Youth A stated Staff 3 entered her room and took her bedding\nand one shoe. She stated she still had one shoe, that she kept it to feel like she still\nhad control. Youth A reported that Staff 3 got mad and another staff entered her\n3",
    "room and grabbed her from behind the toilet. Youth A stated she grabbed Staff 3’s\nface mask, he “stomped” on her, but she thought it was an accident.\nYouth A reported that she was standing by the toilet and staff grabbed her hands\nfirst, that she fell to the floor, then staff grabbed her feet. Youth A reported that Staff\n3 was by her head on her left side of her body, Staff 2 had her left foot and Staff 5\nhad her right foot. Youth A stated that Staff 1 was not there. Youth A stated she\nwas hitting staff, rolling around and trying to get away from staff. Youth A said this is\nwhen Staff 3 “stomped” on her while she was laying on her stomach on the floor.\nShe stated she felt her rib crack, that she could not breath and that she was\nscreaming at staff, “my rib, my rib.” Youth A reported Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 5 then\nleft her room and she stayed on the floor crying. Youth A stated she still had Staff\n3’s face mask. She stated she was able to get the small piece of metal out of the\nmask and kept it in her hand.\nYouth A reported she refused her meds that day and refused to eat lunch. She\nstated she cut her left wrist and smeared blood on her leg. Youth A reported that\nthere was blood everywhere. Youth A stated that Staff 6 came into her room to talk\nwith her and Staff 3 joined him. She stated staff cleaned her wound and talked with\nher about the incident. Youth A stated she did not see the nurse that day but did the\nnext morning.\nIt should be noted that Youth A described Staff 5 being in the room getting her shoe\nwith Staff 2 and Staff 3. Staff 5 was not in the unit that day or seen on camera\nfootage entering her room. Staff 4 was the staff member assisting Staff 2 and Staff\n3 in Youth A’s room getting her shoe.\nYouth A stated she saw the nurse the next day. Youth A reported that she had a\nbruise on her arm and her ribs were still hurting but she did not tell the nurse about\neither injury. Youth A reported that the nurse looked at her cut and put some cream\non it. Youth A reported she was in her room for four days and only left to shower.\nYouth A said that one day staff forgot she was in her room and did not check on her\nfor 45 minutes. Youth A reported having a good relationship with staff.\nOn December 18, 2020 I interviewed Staff 1 in person at the facility along with\nDHHS Worker and Officer 1. Staff 1 reported that she was with the youth during\ntheir free time when Youth A asked for an envelope. Staff 1 reported she was the\nonly one on the unit and could not leave to get an envelope at that time, which she\nexplained to Youth A. Staff 1 reported that Youth A complained a bit and that is\nwhen Staff 2 entered the unit. Staff 1 stated that right away Youth A asked Staff 2\nfor an envelope. Staff 1 stated she told Youth A she was being disrespectful and\nasked her to go to her room. She said Youth A refused, stood up from the table and\nwalked toward her. Staff 1 stated that is when Staff 2 stepped in-between and Youth\nA reached around Staff 2 and hit the right side of her face. Staff 1 stated the hit\nknocked her face mask off. Staff 1 reported that Staff 2 put Youth A in her room and\n4",
    "a supervisor was called into the unit. Staff 1 reported Staff 3 asked her to step off\nthe unit and she has not worked with Youth A since the incident.\nStaff 1 reported that this was the first time she ever had a physical incident with\nYouth A. She described Youth A as manipulative. Staff 1 reported that when Youth\nA refused to go to her room that Staff 2 called a BMT over the radio.

He stated Youth A did not fall,\nshe continued to yell at staff and was still escalated.\nStaff 2 reported Staff 3 entered the unit to talk with Youth A. Staff 2 reported that he\nheard commotion and went in and Youth A was trying to grab Staff 3’s jacket. Staff\n2 reported he grabbed Youth A’s left arm and Staff 4 grabbed Youth A’s right arm.\nStaff 2 reported that Youth A was standing up the entire time and never was on the\nfloor.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A was taking her fingernails and scratching herself. He stated\nshe dug herself and she was bleeding. Staff 2 reported Staff 3 cleaned the\nscratches, made a referral to CMH and Youth A was placed on the nurse’s list to be\nexamined. Staff 2 reported he talked with Youth A about her behavior and tried to\nhelp her understand why she received a BMT. Staff 2 reported he did not see any\nmarks or bruises on Youth A and has not seen her since the incident.\nOn December 18, 2020 I interviewed Staff 3 in person at the facility along with\nDHHS Worker and Officer 1. Staff 3 reported that he heard the call for a BMT and\nwent to view the incident on camera. He stated he walked to the unit and entered\nYouth A’s room to talk with her and see how she was doing.

    "she was standing the entire time. Staff 3 reported Youth A sat on the bed once she\nwas no longer had ahold of his coat.\nStaff 3 described Youth A’s behavior as challenging but never physical. He stated\nshe has had multiple BMT’s but that normally her nature is not violent. Staff 3\nreported Youth A as having self-harming behavior where she will pick at old scabs\nuntil she bleeds. Staff 3 reported Youth A was picking at scrabs and was bleeding.\nHe stated he cleaned her up, put her name on the nurse’s list and put her on the\nCMH list. He denied seeing any bruises on Youth A and that she did not report any\ninjuries.\nOn December 18, 2020 I interviewed Nurse in person at the facility along with DHHS\nWorker and Officer 1.

Nurse denied that Youth A ever received an injection at any time\nwhile at the facility.\nNurse reported that she saw Youth A on December 14, 2020 because she was on\nthe nurse’s list for a mark on her wrist. Nurse reported that Youth A had scratches\non her abdomen. She stated the scratches hardly broke the skin. Nurse reported\nthat she examined Youth A’s wrists; there were no marks on Youth A’s right wrist\nand the left wrist had a pimple on it that had been picked. Nurse stated to Youth A,\n“that’s not new, that was there on Friday.” Nurse reported later in the day that Youth\nA asked her to look at her cheek area because it hurt.

Nurse stated the Youth A never said that her ribs hurt or\nanything on her body hurt and did not mention the events from the previous day.\nNurse stated she only knew about it because of the report from staff.\nOn December 18, 2020 I interviewed Staff 4 over the phone along with DHHS\nWorker and Officer 1.

Staff 4 stated he and Staff 2 grabbed her arms to\nremove them from Staff 3’s coat and that was the end of it.\n6",
    "On December 18, 2020 I interviewed Director in person at the facility. Director\nreported that when a youth assaults a staff or peer, confinement in their room can be\nup to 72 hours. Director stated the behavior is reviewed, discussed and approvals\nhave to be given for room confinement. Youth A received a 72-hour room\nconfinement, and 15-minute room checks were completed. Youth A was able to\nleave her room for a shower. Medication and meals were brought to Youth A’s\nroom. Documentation of the facility’s policy and room checks were reviewed and\ndiscussed.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nI reviewed four Incident Reports dated on 12/13/2020 regarding the events that led\nto Youth A being placed in her bedroom and the events that occurred while she was\nin her bedroom. The Incident Reports were completed by the staff that were\ninvolved in the BMT, with Youth A. One incident report indicates that Staff 2 placed\nYouth A into her room. Another incident report indicates that due to Youth A hitting\nStaff 1, Staff 2 “made sure Youth A was placed into her room.” A third incident\nreport indicates, Staff 2 stepped in front of Youth A to prevent her from going after\nStaff 1 and assisted Youth A into her room.\nI reviewed a video of the altercation between Youth A and Staff 1 and Staff 2. The\nvideo shows Staff 2 enter the unit while Youth A and Staff 1 are sitting at different\ntables. Staff 1 is seen walking towards Youth A, it appears she is talking to her, then\nis seen getting keys out as she is walking toward Youth A’s bedroom door. Staff 1\nopens Youth A’s door, Youth A is still sitting at the table and Staff 2 is standing in the\nmiddle of the unit. Staff 2 is seen raising his walkie talkie to his mouth (a BMT is\nbeing called in). Youth A gets up from the table and walks toward Staff 1, Staff 2\nwalks toward Staff 1 and Youth A. Youth A is standing in front of Staff 1 and it\nappears they are talking back and forth. Staff 2 intervenes between Youth A and\nStaff 1. Staff 2 puts his right hand on Youth A’s left side and pushes her toward her\nroom. His right hand is on Youth A’s shoulder area. Youth A is out of camera view\nas is Staff 2. Staff 1 can be seen standing next to the open door. Staff 2 then\ncomes into camera view and is closing the door to Youth A’s room. The door\nappears to be pushed back by Youth A and Youth A’s hand/arm can be seen hitting\nStaff 1. Staff 2 is seen closing Youth A’s door while Staff 1 is behind him. This\ninteraction starts at 10:47:54 and ends at 10:49:11.\nThere is further video that shows Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 4 enter Youth A’s\nbedroom. It was reported by Director that Youth A’s belongings needed to be\nremoved from her room per policy, so she is not able to harm herself while in a BMT.\nVideo shows Staff 2 and Staff 3 in Youth A’s bedroom for 8 seconds before Staff 4\nenters. All three staff exit Youth A’s room 7 seconds later. It appears that Staff 3 no\nlonger has a face mask on when he exits Youth A’s room. He was wearing a face\nmask when he went into the room.\n7",
    "I reviewed the facility’s Security Management Section 400 Policy 4.22. Physical\nForce. Youth A’s verbal statements toward Staff 1 did not warrant Staff 2 pushing\nYouth A into her room. This is not a behavior management technique that is taught\nor approved.\nI reviewed the facility’s Room Confinement Monitoring Record for the time period\nthat Youth A was confided to her room. Room checks were completed every 15\nminutes.\nI reviewed the facility’s Discipline and Group Management Section 300 Policy 3.12\nGroup Intervention Program. The policy outlines time limits, authorization and report\nrequirements for discipline and group management. The time limit for Youth A’s\nroom confinement fell within the policy for assaulting staff.\nAn Incident Report dated 12/13/2020 indicated a referral to CMH and the nurse had\nbeen made due to Youth A’s self-harming behavior. Youth A was picking scabs and\nbumps on her wrist making them bleed. The incident report indicates that Youth A’s\ncut was washed, and antibiotic cream was applied to the area.\nI reviewed an incident report dated 12/14/2020 completed by Nurse. The report\nindicated that Youth A was on the nurses list for a cut on her wrist. Both wrists were\nexamined by the nurse. The incident report indicated that nothing was on Youth A’s\nright wrist but her left wrist had a pimple on it that she had been picking. The\nmarking was not new and had been previously treated by the nurse. The incident\nreport indicates, the mark was present before Youth A’s altercation with staff over\nthe weekend.\nAn incident report dated 12/14/2020 completed by Nurse reported that while passing\nnoon meds, Youth A asked her if she could see any bruising on her right cheek.\nNurse reported that she inspected the area and did not see any bruising or\ndiscoloration. Nurse touched Youth A’s face and Youth A reported to her that it did\nnot hurt in that area.\nAn Incident Report dated 12/17/2020 completed by the Nurse indicated that Youth A\nhad a bruise on her right cheek and right forearm, eczema on bilateral creases of\nher arms, scratches on her abdomen on her left hip that Youth A indicated were self-\ninflicted. The report indicated when Youth A was asked about the bruising and she\nstated she “doesn’t know.” Pictures were taken and the report indicated that there\nwere no other bruising or markings on Youth A’s back, front chest or torso. Legs\nand arms have acne which is being treated.\nYouth A’s medication log summary and medication administration records were\nreviewed. There were no entries of Youth A ever receiving an injection while at the\nfacility.\n8",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10157 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) A facility shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures that address all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical and dental care.\n(b) Health screening procedures.\n(c) Maintenance of health records.\n(d) Storage of medications.\n(e) Dispensing medication.\n(f) Personnel authorized to dispense medications.\nANALYSIS: The facility made the referral to CMH for Youth A to receive\nmental health treatment. Youth A never received an injection\nwhile at the facility. There is no documentation of any injection\never given to Youth A while at the facility. Nurse A reported a\nyouth would only receive an injection if they had gonorrhea and\nit would be documented in the youth’s medical chart.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10103 Program statement.\nWritten policies and procedures pertaining to the\nadmission, care, and release of residents.\nANALYSIS: Staff 2 stated he pushed Youth A into her room and is seen in\nvideo footage pushing Youth A into her bedroom. This is a\nviolation of the facility’s CPI methods and their Security\nManagement Policy.\nTEHCNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTechnical Assistance was provided regarding how staff in this\nsituation may have been the cause of escalating Youth A’s\nbehavior. Staff need to better understand how their response to\na youth’s actions can led to escalating a situation. Youth A\nstruck Staff 1 after being pushed into her room by Staff 2.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n9",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10176 Resident confinement room.\nConfinement to a resident confinement room for up to 72\nhours may be used when a resident has been charged with\na major rule violation that endangers the safety of residents\nor others or endangers the security of the facility.\nANALYSIS: Youth A was placed in seclusion for assaulting a staff member,\nwhich is considered a major violation at the facility. The time in\nseclusion followed the facility’s time limits, authorization and\nreporting requirements.\nTEHCNICAL ASSITANCE\nTechnical Assistance was provided regarding Youth A being in\nconfinement for 72 hours when she did not have a history of\naggressive behavior, her behaviors were escalated after being\npushed by staff, and her behaviors had calmed down soon after\nshe was placed in confinement. Youth A was able to debrief\nwith Staff 3 about the situation and change her behavior. Youth\nA demonstrated in less than 72 hours that her behavior\nchanged. It is recommended that each situation be assessed\nindividually as appropriate for the length of time in confinement.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, the recommendation is to\ncontinue the current licensing status.\n01/26/2021\n________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant WOC\n10",
