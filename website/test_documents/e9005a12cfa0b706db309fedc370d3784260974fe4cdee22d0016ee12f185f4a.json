Program Manager said she received information from\nMedical Staff Z who was present during the incident. Program\nManager said Medical Staff Z reported she was unsure if Staff 1\nmade contact with Youth A’s face due to the angle at which she\nwas standing. Program Manager said the incident took place in a\ndoorway near the medical office which is out of camera view.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on April 7,\n2025. Youth A said he was not able to remember what Staff 1 was\ndoing but knows he did not like it, so Youth A started to punch her\nand pull her hair. Youth A said Staff 1 was trying to get him to let\ngo of her hair and hit him in the face on his left cheek. Youth A\nsaid he then calmed down and went back to his unit. Youth A said\nhe had a bruise on his cheek from Staff 1. Youth A said Staff 2 and\nMedical Staff X were present during the situation with no other\nyouth around. Youth A said this occurred in the doorway of the\nfamily game room. At that time Youth A said he did not want to talk\nanymore and left the room.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on April 7,\n2025. Staff 1 said she has worked with Youth A previously but is a\nfloater staff so is not consistently on his unit. Staff 1 said Youth A\nwas moved to her unit the day of the incident due to being in a\nphysical altercation with another youth on his unit. Staff 1 said\nYouth A repeatedly was walking off the unit trying to go back to his\nown unit and she was following him on and off the unit several\ntimes. Staff 1 said Youth A walked off the unit and was looking in\nhis unit and saw a peer touching his belongings which made him\nvery upset. Staff 1 said Youth A then walked off the unit and over\nto the medical office and began to hit and kick the window and\ndoor.

Youth A grabbed her\nhair and began to pull. Staff 1’s hair length is down to her\nwaistline; she reported Youth A had her hair at about halfway\ndown her back. Staff 1 said she was attempting to use the\n“release from hair pulls” from her training by taking hold of his\nhand with her closed hand and pull it towards her. Staff 1 said\nStaff 2 was able to assist her and get Youth A’s hands out of her\nhair. Staff 1 said once Youth A’s hands were out of her hair, he\nbegan to start punching her again and she once again used the\n“deflective swing” from training. Staff 1 said Youth A suddenly\nmade the comment that she had hit him and stopped being\naggressive. Staff 1 said she does not believe she made contact\nwith Youth A’s face and if she did it was not intentional but rather\nwhen she was deflecting his punches. Staff 1 said she stepped\nback and Staff 2 stepped in and walked Youth A back to his unit.\nStaff 1 said she never saw any marks on Youth A’s face.

Staff 2 said Staff 1 was\nstanding by Youth A talking with him and he grabbed Staff 1’s hair\nand was pulling. Staff 2 said he and Staff 1 worked on getting\nYouth A’s hands out of Staff 1’s hair and after about a minute\nYouth A let go and went back to the unit. Staff 2 said during the\nincident Youth A was yelling but he never heard him say Staff 1\nhad hit him. Staff 2 said Medical Staff Z was also present for the\nincident but was unsure of where she was standing. Staff 2 said\nhe never saw Staff 1 hit or swing her arm or hand near Youth A’s\nface. Staff 2 said he did not see any marks or bruises on Youth A.\nStaff 2 said Youth A is commonly unpredictable and assaults staff\n“often”. Staff 2 said he has never seen Staff 1 be aggressive with\nthe youth and “all the kids love her”.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on April 7,\n2025.

Medical Staff Z\nsaid she originally felt unsure if she saw Staff 1 make contact with\nYouth A however now feels confident that Staff 1 made contact\nwith Youth A’s face however is unsure if it was intentional. Medical\nStaff Z said Medical Staff Y went to the unit and took pictures of\nYouth A’s face. Medical Staff Z said she does not work on the units\nso does not see Staff 1 interact with the youth. Medical Staff Z\nsaid she has never heard of Staff 1 being aggressive previously.\nMedical Staff Z denied Medical Staff X being involved or present\nduring the incident.\nMedical Staff Y was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nApril 7, 2025. Medical Staff Y said she was not present for the\nincident however was told to go to Youth A’s unit to take\nphotographs of his face. Medical Staff Y said Youth A did not have\nany cuts or bruises on his face, noting some redness. Medical\nStaff Y said she asked Youth A what happened, and he said that\nStaff 1 hit him in the face.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage of April 2, 2025, in the hallway outside of the\nnurse’s office was reviewed on April 7, 2025. Youth A walks to\nthe nurse’s office window and is pounding and kicking.

    "• Incident Report written by Staff 2 dated April 2, 2025, was\nconsistent with Staff 2’s interview.\n• Incident Report written by Staff 1 dated April 2, 2025, was\nconsistent with Staff 1’s interview.\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: There was discipline on August 6,\n2021, for failure to complete required training; September\n7, 2021, for failure to complete required training; May 9,\n2022, for inappropriate conversation with youth which\nconsisted of sharing that she was going to call into work\nwith a “fake note”; and June 21, 2024, for allowing youth to\nlisten to “non-approved music”. Staff 1 completed her TCI\ntraining on March 21, 2025.\n• Whaley Children’s Center Physical Intervention Policy was\nreviewed. The policy prohibits staff from “hitting or striking”\nyouth and requires staff to utilize Therapeutic Crisis\nManagement (TCI) techniques during any physical\nintervention with youth.\n• Therapeutic Crisis Management (TCI) restraint skills\ncurriculum was reviewed for “Release from Hair Pulls” and\n“Deflecting a Swing”.\no Release from hair pulls is described as staff taking\nadvantage of the weakness in the youth’s grasp at\ntheir knuckles by pressing on the youth’s knuckles\nand raking the youth’s hand away.\no Deflecting a swing is described as a staff raising his\narm towards the ceiling and deflecting the swing\naway using the forearm with the open hand.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as there was not enough\ninformation to support a rule violation as Staff 1 and Staff 2 denied\nStaff 1 hitting Youth A; Youth A said Staff 1 hit him; and Medical\nStaff Z at first said she was unsure then said she was sure but not\nsure of the intent. There was no video and no marks on Youth A\nfollowing the incident.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
