    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation During an unannounced visit at the facility the medication cart was\nunlocked.\nInvestigation I completed a walkthrough of Leppien House on December 9,\n2024. Upon entering the medication office, the medication cart\nwas observed to be unlocked. Youth A was laying down in his\nbedroom with Staff 1 outside Youth A’s bedroom door. Youth A\nwas the only youth in the house at the time.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nDecember 9, 2024. Staff 1 reported he received the\nhouse/medication keys from Staff 2 at Holbrook at approximately\n9am, December 9, 2024. Staff 1 described the keys are supposed\nto be passed at the house (Leppien) so the staff receiving the\nkeys can count the medication, make sure the count is correct,\nsign the binder and ensure the medication cart is locked. Staff 1\nreported he took Youth A to Leppien to lay down at approximately\n9:15-9:30am. Staff 1 reported he could not recall if he went into\nthe office where the medication cart is located or not when he took\nYouth A to the house. Staff 1 stated the medication cart should\nhave been locked.\nVideo Review\nVideo footage of 12/09/24 in the staff office where the medication\ncart is located was reviewed on 12/13/2024. Staff 1 is seen\nentering the staff office at approximately 8:41am, unlock the\nmedication cart, place a key in the cart, walk away from the cart\nand out of the staff office. Staff 1 does not lock the medication cart\nafter unlocking and opening the cart. No other person enters the\nstaff office until the unannounced visit is completed by consultant.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Residential Services Standard Operating Procedures,\nResidential Storage of Medication: Policy states, “All\nmedication shall be stored in the locked medication cart.\nThis locked cart will be placed in a location within each\nresidence that is an area restricted to residents and that\nrequires entrance through one locked door.”\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as the medication cart was\nleft unlocked.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered to store the key Staff 1 was\nsecuring in the medication cart in a different locked area to\n2",

Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nDecember 13, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nBarbara A Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 13, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3"
