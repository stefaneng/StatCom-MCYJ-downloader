    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to\nSection requirements; staff qualifications\nDescription (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Law enforcement was contacted due to concerns expressed that a\nstaff was attempting to a look at a youth who was changing.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via phone on\n8/30/24. CA reported he and Clinical Manager (CM) spoke with\nYouth A, Youth B, and Youth C to understand what occurred from\ntheir individual perspectives. All three youth reported Program\nManager (PM) came into Youth A’s room, without knocking, while\nYouth A was in the middle of changing her clothes. CA reported\nthe youth approached their concerns as PM was disrespectful to\nthem and their privacy rather than accusing him of being a sexual\npredator. CA reported PM did not violate any protocols as they\nhave no policies requiring staff to knock when completing room\nchecks. However, CA reported they could improve practice to\ninclude a knock, then immediately open the door process to\nmitigate this issue in the future.\nYouth A was interviewed via phone on 9/5/24. Youth A reported\nshe was in her room getting changed and getting ready for school\nthe following day. Youth A reported it was her, Youth B, and Youth\nC in the bedroom. Youth A reported while she was taking her\nclothes off, PM “bust” in the room, stood in the doorway for about\na minute staring at her, and then left the room. Youth A reported\nhe didn’t say anything during the interaction. Youth A reported PM\ncame back for another room check, and PM got into a verbal\nargument with Youth B. Youth A reported Youth B stated she was\ngoing to call the police. Youth A reported normally staff knock\nbefore entering the bedrooms when doing room checks, but this\ntime he didn’t. Youth A reported PM has never done anything like\nthis before, but he should be more careful considering he’s a male\nstaff working with female youth.\nAttempts were made via phone and text to interview Youth B\non 9/5/24 and 9/27/24, but no return contact was received.\nYouth B was no longer at the facility at the time the investigation\nbegan.\n2",
    "Youth C was interviewed via phone on 9/5/24. Youth C\nreported PM came in at midnight, and during his first round of\nroom checks, he entered her and Youth A’s room without\nknocking. Youth C reported Youth A was changing at the time.\nYouth C reported when PM opened the door, he slowly looked\nover Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C, and then left. Youth C\nreported after PM shut the door, Youth C reported she yelled he\nneeded to knock next time. Youth C reported they locked the\nbedroom door after PM left. When PM came to do the next room\ncheck, the door was locked, and PM told them they couldn’t lock\nthe door. Youth C reported they have previously been told they\ncould lock the doors while they’re changing, but for some reason\nPM said it couldn’t happen anymore. Youth C reported PM told\nthem if they had a problem with what he was doing, they could\ncontact the authorities, so Youth C called the police to report him.\nYouth C reported every other staff knocks when doing room\nchecks, and PM usually does too, but for some reason he didn’t\nthat night.\nClinical Manager (CM) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 9/3/24. CM reported all three youth met with her and\nCA after the incident to process what happened. Youth A told\nthem she had her jeans and a sports bra on when PM opened the\ndoor for a room check. Youth A reported when PM opened the\ndoor, she felt PM was staring at her while she was in a state of\nundress. CM reported Youth B confirmed she felt PM was staring,\nbut Youth C stated she didn’t notice him staring. CM reported\nYouth A was mostly upset PM did not knock before entering the\nroom.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed via phone on 9/5/24.\nPM reported upon arriving on shift at midnight, he began\nconducting room checks. PM reported bedroom doors are\nsupposed to be unlocked and cracked at night, but when he\narrived at Youth A’s door, it wasn’t cracked. PM reported he\nopened the door to complete the check and Youth A was wearing\njeans and a sports bra. PM reported Youth B and Youth C were\nalso in the room, although Youth B wasn’t supposed to be\nbecause it wasn’t her room. PM informed Youth B she shouldn’t\nbe in the room and asked her to leave. PM reported none of the\nyouth said anything to him when he opened the door. PM reported\nhe was only in the doorway for a few seconds before leaving. PM\nreported when he completed the next room check, the door was\nlocked even though it shouldn’t have been. PM reported he\nknocked on the door and no one answered, so he asked Staff 1 to\ncomplete the room check and unlock the door because she was a\n3",
    "female staff, and he felt the youth locked the door intentionally to\nkeep him out. PM reported when Staff 1 opened the door, all three\nyouth stated PM looked at them inappropriately, which is why they\nlocked the door. PM told Staff 1 not to engage with them and told\nthem if they felt their rights had been violated, they needed to\nfollow the grievance process. PM reported instead of following the\ngrievance process, the youth decided to contact the police, who\ncame and spoke with them.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 9/27/24. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A, Youth B, and Youth C were locking their bedroom doors\nthroughout the night, prior to PM coming in for his shift. Staff 1\nreported she was in the office writing notes while PM was\ncompleting room checks. Staff 1 reported on the second round of\nroom checks, PM came back to the office to get Staff 1 and let her\nknow Youth A’s bedroom door was locked. PM asked Staff 1 to\nunlock the door and complete the room check because she was a\nfemale staff. Staff 1 went to Youth A’s room, unlocked the door,\nand entered the room without knocking. Staff 1 reported as soon\nas she opened the door, Youth B said, “[PM] was looking at us”,\nand then Youth B began cussing at her and calling her\ninappropriate names. Staff 1 reported PM told her not to engage\nwith the youth, and PM was trying to diffuse the situation. Staff 1\nreported Youth B said, “fine, if you’re not going to do anything,\nthen I’m going to call the police” and then said, “we’re going to\nshow him”. Staff 1 reported it was clearly Youth B’s intention to get\nPM in trouble even though he didn’t do anything wrong. Staff 1\nreported PM is a very professional man, and she has never had\nany concerns with his performance or interactions with the youth.\nStaff 1 reported staff can knock on the door before entering, but\nit’s not a requirement for room checks. Staff 1 reported if she\nknocks on the door, she doesn’t wait for a response before\nentering the room.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 8/28/24 was viewed. The video shows PM\ncompleting bedroom checks at 12:16 am. He opens two different\nbedroom doors, stands at the doorway of each, closes the doors,\nand walks away. The bedroom checks were approximately 3-5\nseconds long. PM did not knock prior to opening each of the two\nbedrooms.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Agency Response Strategy email dated 8/28/24 states PM\nwill be kept away from youth while investigation is\nunderway.\n4",
    "• Incident Report dated 8/28/24 completed by PM is\nconsistent with PM’s interview.\n• Royal Oak Police Department report #240031796 dated\n8/28/24 was consistent with interviews conducted.\n• Resident Supervision Policy (rev. 7/10/24) outlines staff\nrequirements for completing bed checks. It does not note\nstaff are required to knock on bedroom doors prior to\nentering rooms.\n• Employee Handbook states the agency practices a zero-\ntolerance policy for intentional illegal and/or unethical\nbehavior. It notes youth have the right to be treated with\nconsideration and respect, with due recognition of personal\ndignity, individuality, and the need of privacy.\n• Staff, Volunteer & Intern Handbook provides information on\nthe process for overnight room check procedures for youth.\nIt does not note staff are required to knock on bedroom\ndoors prior to entering rooms.\n• Basic Center Resident Handbook states bedroom doors\nare to remain partially open throughout the night, youth are\nnot allowed in each other’s rooms, and bed checks will be\nconducted every 15 minutes or less throughout the night.\n• A Step Forward Resident Handbook states bedroom\nchecks will be made in variable increments not to exceed\n15 minutes, youth are not allowed in each other’s rooms,\nand the bedroom doors are not allowed to be locked while\nyouth are occupying the room.\n• Program Manager (PM) has one disciplinary action and one\nperformance improvement plan in his employee file,\nunrelated to this investigation. PM’s training log did not note\nwhen he was trained on room check or supervision policies.\nHowever, PM sent a message on 7/15/24 reminding staff\nabout the room check policy and provided them the Staff,\nVolunteer & Intern Handbook (specifically noting pages 18-\n19) for review.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per interviews, video\nfootage reviewed, and documents reviewed, Program Manager\nperformed the duties of his position appropriately.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
