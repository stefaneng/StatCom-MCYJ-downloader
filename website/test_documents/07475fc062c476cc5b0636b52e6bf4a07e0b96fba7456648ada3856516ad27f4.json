She stated Youth A was admitted to Hurley Medical Center\non July 13, 2025, and was discharged on July 22, 2025. Upon\ndischarge there was an issue with Youth A’s medications. The\nhospital e-scribed some medication to a pharmacy but not all\nbecause they were under the impression Youth A had those from\nprevious placement. Complainant stated Foster Care Worker\nadmitted she didn’t have the other medications because she threw\nthem away. By this time, it was 8pm or 9pm. Complainant believes\nthe medication discarded was a psychotropic medication.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via video\nconference on August 12, 2025. FCW stated there were some\nchallenges with some of Youth A’s medications. The hospital\nwrote prescriptions for medications. There were other medications\nfrom Youth A’s previous placement that had been thrown away by\nthe foster parent. She believes Foster Parent threw away all the\nmedications except one but could not recall which one. Upon\ndischarge Youth A had the prescriptions she needed at that time\nand FCW picked up the remaining prescriptions the following day.\nFoster Care supervisor (FC supervisor) was interviewed via\nvideo conference on August 12, 2025. He reported the hospital\nonly provided prescriptions for the medication they had changed.\nFCW had to pick up the prescriptions Youth A had at the previous\nfoster placement. He isn’t aware of FCW or Foster Parent\ndischarging any medication. Youth A didn’t go without any\nmedication that was needed and FCW obtained the rest the\nfollowing day. He felt FCW did the best job she could during a\nvery difficult situation and maintained communication with the\nhospital. He felt the hospital was taking out other frustrations on\nFCW.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A’s MISACWIS case file. July 22, 2025, and July 23,\n2025 social work contacts indicate FCW went to 2 separate\npharmacies and picked up some of Youth A’s medication\nprior to discharge and the rest the following morning.\n2",
    "Analysis The agency is found to be in compliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of Youth A’s MISACWIS case file there is\ndocumentation FCW obtained Youth A’s prescription medication.\nThere is no reason to believe Youth A went without vital\nmedication during placement changes.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12320 Supervision\nSection • (1) An agency shall ensure an appropriate level of care and\nDescription supervision for the foster child at all times consistent with a\nchild's age, level of functioning, and treatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency failed to pick up youth from hospital despite youth being\nready for discharge.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on August 7,\n2025. Youth A was admitted on July 13, 2025. Complainant stated\nshe spoke with FCW on July 14, 2025, who reported Youth A\nwould not be returning to previous foster placement and FCW was\nworking on alternative placement. Youth A was a quick readmit,\nmeaning she had been there very recently and explained to FCW\nthis would be a short hospitalization, so the agency was aware.\nWednesday of that week there was the treatment team meeting,\nand they would be able to provide a better idea of the discharge\ndate. FCW was called and participated in the treatment team\nmeeting and was told Youth A’s scheduled discharge was Friday,\nJuly 18, 2025.\nComplainant called FCW and let her know the hospital can keep\nYouth A through the weekend and to plan for discharge on\nMonday, July 21, 2025. FCW reported there still wasn’t a\nplacement secured. Complainant stated the agency needed to\npick her up at the discharge date. FCW reported she doesn’t work\non Mondays. The hospital agreed to update the discharge date to\nTuesday, July 22, 2025, to work with the agency. The hospital was\nalso doing some minor adjustments with Youth A’s medications\nand could monitor.\nComplainant stated on Friday July 18, 2025, she requested a\npickup plan from FCW since she reported not working on\nMondays. FCW agreed to pick Youth A up at noon on Tuesday,\nJuly 22, 2025. On Tuesday, she spoke with FCW first thing in the\nmorning and FCW reported placement unit had not located a\nplacement. FCW inquired if the hospital would be willing to do a\nsingle case agreement while they continue to search for\nplacement. The hospital stated that wasn’t appropriate and\n3",
    "declined. Complainant stated she and others from the hospital\nrepeatedly tried calling FCW and she would not answer. FCW\neventually picked up Youth A later in the evening around 7pm.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via video\nconference on August 12, 2025. She stated Youth A was placed\nat Hurley from July 13, 2025, through July 22, 2025. She stated\nthis was the second time she had been placed there, and the\nagency was aware they needed to locate a new foster placement\nupon discharge as Foster Parent indicated Youth A was not able\nto return to their home. FCW stated the agency put in a referral to\nlocate a new placement through the placement unit on June 30,\n2025, or July 1, 2025, as soon as they were aware. Youth A’s\nprevious foster parent had put in her two week notice so the\nagency knew Youth A couldn’t go back. The placement search\nstarted right away. FCW stated she continued to update the\nplacement unit regarding Youth A’s discharge date.\nInitially, Youth A was scheduled to be discharged on Friday, July\n18, 2025, and then hospital placement changed it to the following\nMonday and changed again to Tuesday, July 22, 2025. FCW\nstated she and the agency continued to work on locating a\nplacement for Youth A all day on July 22, 2025, and the hospital\nwas adamant that she needed to be picked up and bring her to\ntheir office if they didn’t have another option. FCW stated at that\npoint, they did not have placement or a safe discharge plan.\nHospital stated Youth A was sitting in the lobby. FCW stated she\ninformed the hospital that it might take a little longer since they\nwere still actively searching for a placement. She inquired how\nlate in the day would she be able to come and pick Youth A up\nand was told it could be as late as 9pm that night as long as\nsomeone picks her up. She reported to the hospital that it may\nend up being an on call worker if it’s later in the evening.\nFCW stated she was in frequent contact with the hospital social\nworker. The hospital requested a pickup time prior to the\ndischarge date. FCW stated she told social worker to plan for\nnoon but will let her know on Tuesday morning and let her know if\nit will be later than that because she didn’t know for sure what the\nplan would be since a placement had not been located at that\ntime. She called social worker on Tuesday morning and informed\nher the agency still does not have placement lined up and won’t\nbe able to pick her up at noon but asked when could be the latest\nthey picked her up. The hospital continued to press the agency,\nbut they didn’t have anywhere to put Youth A.\n4",
    "FCW stated she and her supervisor spoke with hospital staff\naround 3pm and the hospital wasn’t happy. The hospital spoke\nwith the district manager who ended up securing a placement.\nThe placement located requested a higher rate and that took\nadditional time to work through. FCW stated she ended up picking\nup Youth A around 6 or 6:30 that evening.\nFoster Care supervisor (FC supervisor) was interviewed via\nvideo conference on August 12, 2025. He stated he didn’t have\ncommunication with hospital staff until it was closer to discharge.\nFCW had been working with the regional placement unit for\napproximately 10 days at that point. From the beginning the\nplacement unit was searching for a placement and FCW had\ninformed them of that.\nFC supervisor stated hospital staff were noticeably frustrated and\nreported to him that FCW had reported she would be picking\nYouth A up and there are 3 other DHS kids in the emergency\nroom and Youth A was ready for discharge. They reported Youth\nA was in their lobby with all her belongings. He felt that was\nconcerning because they had informed the hospital they were still\nsearching for placement, and it wasn’t confirmed they would be\npicking her up. FC supervisor stated he reiterated to the hospital\nthat they did not have a safe discharge plan at that point and\ninquired if it was possible if they would make a single case\nagreement until a placement could be located. Shortly after, a\nplacement was located. FCW picked up Youth A sometime that\nevening.\nFC supervisor stated all along the discharge date was scheduled\nfor July 22, 2025, and Youth A was picked up on July 22, 2025.\nHe stated FCW reported she informed the hospital the original\npick up time of noon was not going to work since they hadn’t\nsecured a placement and asked how late she would be able to\npick Youth A up that day.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A’s MISACWIS case file. Several social work\ncontacts on July 22, 2025, from FCW and FC supervisor to\nHurley indicate they did not have a safe discharge plan,\nand they were continuing to look for placement.\nYouth A’s placement history shows she was placed at\nHurley from June 30, 2025-July 8, 2025, and again July 13,\n2025-July 22, 2025.\n• July 1, 2025, email from FCW to placement unit providing\ninformation on Youth A for placement search referral.\n5",
    "Analysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of Youth A’s MISACWIS case file it was\nclear the agency struggled to secure a safe placement upon\ndischarge from Hurley Medical Center. However, there is\ndocumented effort of ongoing placement search. The agency was\nable to secure placement in the early evening of July 22, 2025,\nwhich is the originally scheduled discharge date.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n____________8/27/2025______________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 2, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n6"

    "summary": "A special investigation examined allegations against a county child welfare agency regarding a youth's hospital discharge and medication. The first allegation, that a foster care worker threw away the youth's medication, was not substantiated; interviews and case file review showed the worker obtained the necessary prescriptions and the youth did not go without vital medication. The second allegation, that the agency failed to timely pick up the youth from the hospital, was also not substantiated; the investigation found the agency actively searched for a placement for over a week and ultimately secured one on the scheduled discharge date, though it occurred later in the evening. The report's conclusion that no substantial violations were found indicates the agency's actions, while challenging and delayed, did not rise to the level of a licensing rule violation.",
