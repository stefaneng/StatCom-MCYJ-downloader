This\nwas taken to send to someone else as a nude photo. Youth was\nalso asked for a picture to be taken of their genitals. It is unknown\nwhere staff were when this occurred.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n07/05/2022 Special Investigation Intake 2022C0214027\n07/05/2022 Special Investigation Initiated - On Site\n07/05/2022 Contact - Face to Face interviews with Youth A, Administrator, and\nTherapist.\n07/05/2022 Contact - Document Received: email from Staff 2 to Therapist.\n07/06/2022 Contact - Document Received: Staff information, policy, and team\nmeeting minutes.\n07/08/2022 Contact - Telephone call made for interview with Youth B.\n07/08/2022 Contact - Telephone call made for interview with DHHS Supervisor\nfor Youth B.\n07/11/2022 Contact - Telephone call made for interview with Staff 2.\n07/12/2022 Contact - Telephone call made for interview with Staff 1.\n07/19/2022 Pre-exit interview with Administrator.\nALLEGATION:\nWithin the last month, 18-year-old youth at facility had another youth pose and took\na picture of youth in their boxer shorts. This was taken to send to someone else as\na nude photo. Youth was also asked for a picture to be taken of their genitals. It is\nunknown where staff were when this occurred.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/5/22. Youth A reported\nYouth B asked to take a picture of Youth A's butt with Youth A's boxer shorts on and\nYouth A allowed this to occur. Youth A feared if not granting the request, Youth B\nwould no longer be friends. Youth B informed Youth A the photo was needed for \"a\nguy on snapchat\". Youth B then asked for a picture of Youth A's \"downstairs area\" to\nwhich Youth A declined. Youth B threatened their friendship, but Youth A continued\nto refuse. Youth A also reported this occurred on a Friday during the day when both\nYouth were in their shared bedroom and staff were in the milieu. Staff had just\nfinished a room check when this took place. Youth A reported staff always do their\n15-minute room checks on the youth. Youth A feels safe at the facility now that\nYouth B has left. This is the reason Youth A is now reporting the incident to staff.\n2",
    "Administrator and Therapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n7/5/22. The Therapist indicated not knowing about the allegations until observing the\nreport yesterday. Both reported staff have been doing daily searches and more\nintense searches once a week. They believe this incident may have occurred\nsometime between the first allegations involving Youth B and the second allegations\ninvolving Youth B. Staff have been following the safety plans in place involving\nYouth B. Therapist reported receiving an email about the allegations from Staff 2 on\nSunday after Youth A told Staff 2. Administrator also reported Youth B possessed a\ncell phone from 5/16 to 5/21, at which time Youth B turned the phone over to staff.\nYouth B was interviewed via telephone on 7/8/22. Youth B strongly denied the\nallegations and provided no further information.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on 7/11/22. She reported being told about\nthe allegations by Youth A approximately a week ago. She believed the incident took\nplace when Youth B had a cell phone a couple of months prior to her being\ninformed. She was told by Youth A that Youth B asked to take a picture of Youth A's\nbutt to put on \"snapchat\" to share with someone. Youth A agreed but refused to\nallow a picture of Youth A's \"downstairs area” (genital area) when Youth B asked for\nanother picture. Youth A felt uncomfortable about the request and did not feel\ncomfortable enough to say anything until Youth B was discharged from the program.\nStaff 2 also reported she sent the email to get clarification from her supervisor before\nreporting the incident. She understands the actions a \"mandated reporter\" must take\nbut was unsure what action she should take once finding out after Youth B had left\nthe program. She was planning on making a report as soon as she received\ndirection from her supervisor. She does not believe Youth B was on a \"one-on-one”\nsupervision at that time but did begin that level of supervision shortly after.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on 7/12/22. She reported on 7/4/22 Youth A\nshared the allegations with her. She provided the same information as Staff 2 and\nYouth A presented during their interviews. Youth A told her she felt pressured by\nYouth B and only comfortable enough to share once Youth B was removed from the\nfacility. Staff 1 was unclear when it may have occurred but believed it occurred when\nYouth B had a cell phone a few months ago. She also reported staff found out about\nthe cell phone but are not allowed to take the cell phone and had to wait until the\nyouth was willing to give it over to them. Youth B was placed on \"one-on-one\"\nsupervision shortly after this occurred a few months ago.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nEmail from Staff 2 to Therapist dated 7/3/22. Staff 2 informs Therapist that Youth\nA reported during the time Youth A and Youth B had cell phones, Youth B took a\npicture of Youth A's butt to send to someone on snapchat. Youth A reported to Staff\n2, refusing to allow other pictures to be taken and refusing to \"mess\" around with\nYouth B. Staff 2 also reported to Therapist, Youth B had written letters to other youth\n3",
    "who still had the letters. Staff 2 was requesting information on reporting an incident\nafter the fact.\nMaple Team Meeting Minutes dated 6/20/22. This document outlines the agenda\nthat occurred at this team meeting and who was in attendance. Under the policies\nsection of this report contraband is documented as Tier 1 - Daily on 1st and 2nd\nshifts a visual scan of the youth's room is to occur and any visible contraband is to\nbe removed. Tier 2 - Weekly a more thorough search through youth's belongings is\nto occur. This is to be unannounced, so the youth are not given time to hide/store\ntheir contraband elsewhere prior to the search. A reminder of the mandated\nreporting requirements is outline on this report. All staff are identified as mandated\nreporters and must report to CPS if allegations of abuse/neglect are reported to\nthem by youth or they become aware of abuse/neglect. They are also to notify\nTherapist or on-call clinician when making a report just to give them a heads up.\nSupervision was documented as being addressed and if two youth are outside or in\nany room together staff are to also \"be there\". The information sharing section\nidentified Youth B as requiring 1:1 staff until discharge. It is documented that Youth\nB has been spending a lot of time in the bedroom sleeping\".\nMandated Reporting of Abuse & Neglect dated 12/21. This report documents the\nfacility will follow the Child protection Law of Michigan. It is stated, \"Should a staff\nmember become aware of abuse or neglect, they will notify the On-call Clinician\nimmediately and immediately contact Centralized Intake themselves\". Also stated,\n\"Any suspected or known abuse or neglect will be reported verbally by the person\nwho first became aware of or witnessed the abuse/neglect to Child Protective\nServices by the end of the notifying staff’s shift by calling Centralized Intake\".\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is found in compliance with the sufficiency of staff.\nStaff responded to the information as required and the level of\nsupervision at the time was appropriate. Later investigation\nwould result in an increase in the level of supervision for Youth\nB.\nConsultation\nIf youth are found to have a cell phone, rather than waiting for\nthe youth to turn in the phone, it is recommended that the level\nof supervision increases, not allowing the youth to freely use the\nphone.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend no change to the license status of this child caring institution.\n7/22/2022\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 26, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
