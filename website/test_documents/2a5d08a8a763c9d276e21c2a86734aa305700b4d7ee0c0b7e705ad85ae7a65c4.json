Youth\ndoes not feel safe and continues to AWOL.\nInvestigation This complaint was received on 05/12/2023, assigned on\n05/17/2023 and investigated jointly with the MDHHS Specialist.\nI interviewed Director at the facility on 05/17/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist 1. Director reported Youth A has been at\nthe facility for two weeks and has gone AWOL 9 times. His worker\nis immediately notified and updated. Weekly meetings are held\nwith the team to discuss placement due to concerns for Youth A\ngoing AWOL. Youth A went AWOL this morning and was gone for\napproximately 30 minutes. While speaking with Director Youth A\ncame back to the facility and appeared to be under the influence,\nso staff will be taking him to the hospital for a physical exam and\nassessment. We requested to interview Youth A before being\ntransported to the hospital. There are no incident reports involving\nYouth A being assaulted by staff or restrained. There was one\nincident on 05/11/23 where Youth A attempted to assault Youth B.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 05/17/2023, in Collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist 1. Youth A provided his name and when\nasked questions about the allegations his response to all the\nquestions was “10”. Youth A refused to answer the questions.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 05/17/2023 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Youth B has been at the facility for 2\nmonths. He denied witnessing staff hit Youth A. He reported Youth\nA is the one that threatens staff and other youths.

She reported\nYouth A was very vague and would not provide specific details\nregarding when this occurred or who is physically abusing him.\nYouth A did not report having any bruises or injuries. Police were\ncalled on 05/17/2023 because Youth A assaulted a staff member.\nYouth A said Staff punched him in the nose, but Youth A did not\nhave bruises or marks. Youth A got in trouble for assaulting the\nstaff, so she could not be sure he said he got hit by staff because\nhe got in trouble for assaulting the staff. Youth A has a history of\ngoing AWOL and being aggressive.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 05/23/2023 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist 1.

There was one incident on 05/17/2023 involving Youth A\nassaulting Staff 2, grabbing her bag and dumping it on the floor.\nShe was informed of the incident and immediately removed Staff 1\nfrom the unit. The police were contacted. She reported Staff 2 has\nbeen working at the facility for 8 months and has no disciplinary\nactions.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 05/23/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 2 reported that on 05/17/2023, she\n3",
    "was on the 3rd floor with Youth C, who was not feeling well. Youth\nA came upstairs and when she tried to tell him to go back\ndownstairs, he got very angry, and told her, “Shut up bitch, I will\nbeat your ass”, pushed her, and grabbed her bag and dumped on\nthe floor. She said Staff 3 attempted to redirect Youth A and tried\nto get him to calm down. She denied punching or threatening\nYouth A.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 06/09/2023, in collaboration with MDHHS\nSpecialist.

He did witness\nYouth A grab Staff 2’s arm but did not see Youth A hit Staff 2.\nStaff 3 was able to redirect Youth A to let go of Staff 2’s arm and\ngo back to his room. He said Youth A was threating Staff 2, but\ncould not recall exactly what Staff 2 said to Youth A. He said it\ncould have been “if you hit me, I will hit you back.” Staff 3 denied\nwitnessing Staff 2 punch or hit Youth A.\nDHHS Predisposition conference held on 06/13/2023 with MDHHS\nSpecialist and Supervisor, who had no findings.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident reports dated 5/7/23; Youths were in the first-floor\nlounge area and were instructed to clean up the area where\nthey ate. While being redirected Youth A ran out of the\nlounge area out to the parking lot stairwell. Police report\nwas filed.\n• Incident Report 5/8/23 Staff was opening the bathroom and\nYouth A ran in different directions. Youth A ran out the\nDickerson door.

    "• Incident report dated 05/17/2023; Youth A came to the 3rd\nfloor without staff permission. Staff attempted to redirected\nYouth A but he continued to yell. Youth A called Staff 2\n“bitches” and threatened to hit Staff 2. Youth A grabbed\nStaff 2’s bag and pushed her into the chair. Staff 3\nintervened by guiding Youth A back to his room. Youth A\ncontinued to threaten Staff 2, so the police were called.\nAnalysis The facility is in compliance with the rule as there is insufficient\nevidence that staff are physical abusing Youth A, based on interviews\nwith Staff and Youths. Youth A appears to be the one that is\naggressive and assaultive towards staff and youths.\nConsultation Provided:\nDirector was advised to ensure staff are not verbally engaging with\nyouths and using any threatening language when a youth is\nescalated.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n06/26/2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 3, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
