    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The\nagency had one CAP, approved 8/2/22. The CAP was a result of the 7/6/22\nrenewal evaluation.

Overall, the agency has improved in several areas. The\nagency reported successful implementation of their CAP in many areas.

One staff was new to the agency, the other\nhad been there for two years. Both staff report feeling supported by their\nsupervisors.

However, their supervisor was helpful in managing things.\nNeither staff identified any areas the agency could improve in.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is located in an office building in Lansing. The agency has been in this\nbuilding for several years. There is adequate space for staff to work and hold\nfamily visitation. Locking file storage was viewed and found to be sufficient.\n7",
