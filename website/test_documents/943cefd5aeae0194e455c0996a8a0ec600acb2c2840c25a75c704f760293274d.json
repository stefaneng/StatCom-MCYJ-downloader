    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe purpose of this addendum is to modify the terms of the child placing agency\nlicense, to include independent living.\nIII. Methodology\n07/21/05 Contact – face to face. Reviewed program statements and\ndescriptions, policies and procedures for the independent living\nprogram, interviewed Chief Operative Officer, Vice President of\nPlacement Services, and Quality Assurance Coordinator.\n07/21/05 Modify terms of license.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nOn 07/21/05 the Chief Operating Officer, Vice President of Placement Services, and\nthe Quality Assurance Coordinator were interviewed on-site. The program\nstatements and descriptions, policies and procedures, and documentation formats\nfor the independent living program were reviewed on-site. The Chief Operating\nOfficer stated that the rationale for adding an independent living program to the\nagency is to ensure the agency’s ability to provide a continuum of care to the\nchildren who are already serviced by the agency in foster care; who may become in\nneed of independent living services; rather than referring those children elsewhere\nfor services. The agency will begin implementing independent living services for\nchildren in need of those who are currently being serviced by the agency in foster\ncare; however may eventually accept referrals from outside entities to service\nchildren in this program. The program statement, policies and procedures,\ndocumentation formats were found to be in compliance with all applicable licensing\nrules and statutes. The independent living program will be supervised by a single\nsocial services worker, who will report to a social services supervisor. A case record\nfor children being serviced through this program will be kept separate from the foster\ncare case record. The assigned social services worker will be responsible for\nproviding inspection of the proposed independent living placement, providing the\nchild and provider with applicable program information and agreements, assisting\nthe child in developing and maintaining a monthly monetary budget, visiting the child\nmonthly at the placement; and in providing continued services to the child to assist\nwith job placement, education, medical needs, etc. The assigned social services\nworker and supervisor will be responsible for assessing the appropriateness of\nplacement of a referred child into the independent living program; along with the\nchild’s potential to succeed in such a program, the child’s need for supervision, and\nthe appropriateness of the proposed placement, i.e. provider home, shared\napartment, etc.\n2",
    "V. Recommendation\nRecommendation is made to continue the regular license, with modification of the\nterms to add supervision of independent living.\n________________________________________\nPatricia L. Dudgeon-Smith Date\nLicensing Consultant\n3"
