    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4150 Incident Reporting\nSection (3) If an institution determines that a youth is absent without legal\nDescription permission, then the institution shall immediately report the\ninformation to law enforcement, the parent/legal guardian or next\nof kin, the licensing authority, and the referring agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Facility is not notifying case managers when youth go AWOL.\nFacility is not communicating properly regarding youth or making\nthemselves available for communication when case managers\nattempt to contact the facility.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nDirector was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on May 5,\n2025. Director said he is the Senior Director of Residential\nServices and in that capacity is an on-call administrator and\nsupervisor to Therapist and Case Manager. Director said when\nYouth runaway the supervisors will notify Therapist or Case\nManager during business hours and afterhours will notify the on-\ncall administrator. Director said he is one of the administrator’s\nthat make notifications of AWOL’s to the appropriate individuals\nboth during business hours if needed and after hours when on-\ncall. Director said Youth AWOL’s frequently and notifications are\nmade either via email to Foster Care Worker or Youth’s on-call\ncaseworker. Director said Youth’s foster care agency has\nrequested the facility make notifications to the foster care agency\non-call case worker after 5pm however noted the on-call worker\ndoes not come out to the facility to assist in the AWOL search.\nDirector said the facility makes a police report as soon as Youth\nAWOL’s and then upon his return the police department requires\nthe facility to bring Youth to the police department to be removed\nfrom the runaway list. Director said at times this has been difficult\nto do timely as Youth will return dysregulated and is not always\nsafe to place in a vehicle until the following day when many times\nhe would run away again, and they would just use the same police\nreport. Director said the foster care agency has not reported any\nother concerns to him regarding lack of communication.\nTherapist was interviewed via telephone on May 28, 2025.\nTherapist said she works with Youth and has been in continual\ncommunication with Foster Care Worker. Therapist said Youth\nruns away from the facility frequently and she has completed\nmany notifications to Foster Care Worker. Therapist said if it is\nduring business hours of 9am to 5pm the Foster Care Worker is\nemailed however after 5pm and on weekends the foster care\n2",
    "agency has requested the notifications are called into an on-call\nworker. Therapist said calling an on-call worker is not the normal\npractice of the facility as they typically email the assigned worker\nthe information. Therapist said Foster Care Worker had brought\nconcern about the facility not calling the foster care agency’s on-\ncall worker but instead sending the email which the facility has\nsince rectified. Therapist said the foster care agency on-call\nworker does not come and assist or provide any guidance or\ninformation. Therapist said foster care agency has not reported\nany other concerns to her regarding lack of communication.\nTherapist said Youth has had safety plans to address the running\naway and to her knowledge all staff are following the plans.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via telephone on May 28,\n2025. Foster Care Worker said she is assigned to Youth’s case\nand has had contact with Methodist Children’s Home. Foster Care\nWorker originally said she has “a lot of communication issues”\nwith the facility however then stated, “Case Manager, Therapist,\nand [Director] have been great with communication”. Foster Care\nWorker said she had concerns about being notified about Youth’s\nAWOLs hours after he had run away. Foster Care Worker said her\nmain concern was that she was not being properly notified when\nYouth returned from AWOL, and that the police reports were not\nalways accurate for if Youth was AWOL or not. Foster Care\nWorker said it is her expectation the facility notify her within 15\nminutes of Youth running away and within 15 minutes of his\nreturn. Foster Care Worker said she told the facility during\nbusiness hours they can contact her but after business hours and\non the weekends the expectation is for them to call the foster care\nagency’s on-call worker which is not always occurring. Foster\nCare Worker said the foster care agency on-call worker will send\nan email notification to her and her supervisor, program manager\nwhen notified of Youth’s AWOL. Foster Care Worker said she then\nhas to notify WMPC once she receives the AWOL notification.\nFoster Care Worker said the Redford Police do not always have\naccurate information regarding Youth’s whereabouts and there\nhave been times when she has contacted Redford Police, and\nthey still have Youth considered AWOL when he is back at the\nfacility and vice versa. Foster Care Worker said she has helped\ndevelop safety plans for Youth and she believes Therapist, Case\nManager, and Director follow the plans however she is unsure if\nthe direct care staff are following the plans but could not provide\ninstances where the plan was not being implemented.\nRedford Police was interviewed via telephone on June 3,\n2025. Redford Police said it is protocol for Methodist Children’s\n3",
    "Home to go into the police department to make a report for youth\nrunning away and when the youth return the requirement is for\nthem to bring the youth to the police department so they can “lay\neyes on them” and ask the youth some questions. Redford Police\nwas familiar with Youth and stated, “he has so many runaway\nreports”.\nCase Manager was interviewed via telephone on June 3, 2025.\nCase Manager said she is the assigned case manager for Youth,\nas part of this role she has made notifications to Foster Care\nWorker for Youth’s AWOLs. Case Manager said if it is during\nbusiness hours the staff will contact supervisors who then contact\neither her, Therapist, or Director who will make the required\nAWOL notifications. Case Manager said Foster Care Worker did\nnotify the facility that they wanted them to call the foster care\nagency on-call number to report Youth AWOL if it was after\nbusiness hours or on the weekend. Case Manager said she does\nnot know if that is still an ongoing issue. Case Manager said she\nhas not been told by Foster Care Worker or anyone else that there\nare issues with a lack of communication between the facility and\nfoster care agency. Case Manager said Youth has been on safety\nplans for AWOLing and to her knowledge everyone is following\nthose safety plans.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Methodist Children’s Home Runaway/AWOL Policy was\nreviewed. The policy for notifications to foster care worker\nis for direct staff to notify their immediate supervisor who\nthen notifies the therapist who will notify the foster care\nworker. The direct care staff will notify the police when a\nyouth AWOLs.\n• Incident Reports for Youth AWOLs and email notifications to\nFoster Care Worker from January 2, 2025, until April 30,\n2025, were reviewed.
