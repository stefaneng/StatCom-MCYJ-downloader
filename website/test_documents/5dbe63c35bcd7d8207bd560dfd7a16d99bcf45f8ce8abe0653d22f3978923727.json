    "ALLEGATION#1:\nFoster Child A was removed from Foster Parent A without notice or the right to a\nFoster Care Review Board (FCRB) appeal. The agency violated Foster Parent A’s\nFoster Parent Bill of Rights.\nALLEGATION#2:\nFoster Child A was returned to her father’s care despite his pending criminal\ncharges and Foster Child A’s pediatrician’s recommendation. Foster Child A’s\nreturn to her father’s care violated the Referee’s order.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the Complainant’s letter on February 23, 2021. The letter stated Foster Child\nA was placed in her father’s care, who has a significant history of domestic violence,\ncriminal offenses of a sexual nature, controlled substance abuse and suicidal attempts\nor threats. The letter stated Ennis Center for Children returned Foster Child A under the\nguise of reunification with Foster Child A’s father by arranging a stipulated order to\nremove Foster Child A from Foster Parent A and reunify her with her father. The\nComplainant stated reunification occurred before either Foster Child A’s parents\ncompleted necessary services, showed stability, the ability to support themselves or\nFoster Child A and before the resolution of outstanding sexual offense charges pending\nagainst Foster Child A’s father. The letter reported Foster Child A’s pediatrician urged\nEnnis Center for Children to stop the reunification with Foster Child A’s father and at the\nvery least until the felony charges are resolved.\nI interviewed MDHHS Worker 1 via telephone on February 25, 2021. She reported\nFoster Child A’s father was not involved in the beginning of the case because Foster\nChild A’s mother did not disclose Foster Child A’s father’s name. She stated Foster\nChild A’s lawyer guardian ad litem (LGAL) motioned for Foster Child A to return to her\nfather’s care. She said the court signed an order returning Foster Child A to her father’s\ncare and the case is now being serviced by the Intensive Neglect Services Program\n(INS) via Ingham County.\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator, Ennis Center for\nChildren - Pontiac Howell's Satellite Office Director, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac\nFoster Care Worker 1 and Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Supervisor 1\nface-to-face on-site on March 04, 2021. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care\nWorker 1 reported she received an email from Foster Child A’s LGAL on November 16,\n2020 at 3:01 p.m., which included the court order placing Foster Child A with her father.\nShe said she emailed the court order to Foster Parent A, along with their attorney,\nwithin an hour of receiving the court order and informed them that Foster Child A was\nnow placed in the care and custody of her father. She said she also mailed Foster\nParent A a MDHHS-30 Notification of Move form on November 16, 2020. She stated\n4",
    "Foster Child A was removed without advance notice to Foster Parent A because she\nwas not made aware that a stipulation order was submitted by Foster Child A’s LGAL\nuntil after it was submitted and signed by the judge. She reported the following timeline\nof events leading up to the court order placing Foster Child A with her father:\n On November 12, 2020 at 11:05 p.m., Foster Child A’s mother texted Foster\nCare Worker 1 informing her that she would need to cancel her parenting time for\nNovember 13, 2020 due to having car trouble. Foster Care Worker 1 reported\nFoster Child A’s father’s parenting time was every week from Friday after Foster\nChild A’s mother’s parenting time until the following Tuesday. Foster Parent A, at\ntheir request, would transport Foster Child A to a third-party location near Foster\nChild A’s father’s home. Foster Care Worker 1 said she supervised all pick-up\nand drop-offs.\n Foster Care Worker 1 attempted two phone calls with Foster Parent A and a text\nmessage to inform them that the visit for Foster Child A’s was cancelled and\nFoster Care Worker 1 would need to figure out a time for Foster Child A to be\ndropped off with her father. She reported she left a voicemail requesting a return\nphone call each time. She reported Foster Parent A did not return her phone\ncalls.\n On November 13, 2020 at 10:49 a.m., Foster Care Worker 1 received an email\nfrom Foster Parent A stating they had serious reservations about having Foster\nChild A participate in a five-day, four-night overnight visitation with another\nhousehold, in another household. Foster Parent A stated in the email that they\nlooked forward to resuming visitations once the Governor issued an “all clear.”\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported she forwarded Foster Parent A’s email to all\nparties involved with the case.\n On November 13, 2020 at 12:06 p.m., Foster Child A’s LGAL emailed the parties\ninvolved in the case and indicated Foster Child A’s father’s parenting time must\noccur, and if it does not occur, then she would seek next steps with the\nprosecutor’s office.\n On November 13, 2020 at 12:11 p.m., Foster Care Worker 1 received an email\nfrom Foster Child A’s LGAL stating that it was time to move Foster Child A.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported that the statement was regarding Foster Parent\nA’s refusal to allow parenting time to occur with Foster Child A’s father and\nregarding their complaint letter to Ennis Center for Children providing additional\nbarriers for reunification.\n On November 13, 2020 at 1:33 p.m., Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief\nAdministrator voiced his concerns and opposition, via email, regarding Foster\nChild A being placed with her father due to his pending criminal charges.\n On November 16, 2020 at 3:01 p.m., Foster Child A’s LGAL emailed Foster Care\nWorker 1 the court order placing Foster Child A in the care of Foster Child A’s\nfather. The court order was signed on November 13, 2020.\nFoster Care Worker 1 stated per 2004 PA 46, if the court has ordered that the child is\nreturned home, the foster parents do not have the right to an appeal. She reported\nEnnis Center for Children did not recommend Foster Child A to be placed with her\nfather. She stated the stipulation to place child with Foster Child A’s father and\n5",
    "modification of Foster Child A’s parenting time was submitted by the prosecutor, Foster\nChild A’s LGAL, Foster Child A’s mother’s attorney, and Foster Child A’s father’s\nattorney.

    "ALLEGATION#3:\nFoster Parent 1 was not provided written notice of the court proceedings. They\nwere not given court reports despite being told by MDHHS Foster Care POS\nSupervisor 1 that they are entitled to the court reports.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the Complainant’s letter on February 23, 2021. The letter stated Foster\nParent A was not provided required written notice of court proceedings and Ennis\nCenter for Children withheld court reports from them while they were Foster Child A’s\nfoster parent. The letter stated although MDHHS Foster Care POS Supervisor 1 made it\nclear that Foster Parent A were entitled to the court reports, Foster Care Worker 1 still\nrefused to provide them, telling Foster Parent A, “the only way they could learn of what\nwas going on was to attend the hearings.”\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator, Ennis Center for\nChildren - Pontiac Howell's Satellite Office Director, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac\nFoster Care Worker 1, and Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Supervisor 1\nface-to-face on-site on March 04, 2021.

She said Foster Parent A is also mailed notice of court hearings with each court\nhearing as their address has been provided to the court.\nI reviewed documents provided by Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac on March 8, 2021,\nMarch 9, 2021, March 11, 2021, March 15, 2021, March 16, 2021, and April 7, 2021.\nThe documents included the following:\n Foster Parent A was documented as being present for court hearings on Ennis\nCenter for Children court hearing disposition forms dated November 7, 2019,\nJanuary 7, 2020, January 16, 2020, March 18, 2020, June 3, 2020, September 2,\n2020, and October 14, 2020.\n Foster Care Worker 1 emailed Foster Parent A on May 29, 2020 the date, time\nand Zoom information for the June 2, 2020 court hearing.\n Foster Care Worker 1 emailed Foster Parent A on August 26, 2020 the date, time\nand Zoom information for the September 1, 2020 court hearing.\nI reviewed Foster Child A’s case in MiSACWIS on April 13, 2021.

    "APPLICABLE RULE\nMDHHS Policy Court Hearing Notification Requirements.\nFOM 722-10\nState and federal law requires courts to ensure that certain\nparties are notified of proceedings held with respect to a\nchild under the jurisdiction of the court. To facilitate this\nprocess the supervising agency is required to provide\nnotification of all court proceedings to the following:\n• The child, if the child is 11 years or older.\n• The foster parents, relative caregivers, and/or pre-\nadoptive parents.\n• The non-offending parent if the child is placed with that\nparent.\nIf the court provides notice of hearing to the caseworker in\na timely manner, the caseworker must send the DHS 715,\nNotice of Hearing, to the child, foster parents, relative\ncaregivers, the non-offending parent, and/or pre-adoptive\nparents seven calendar days prior to the hearing.\nANALYSIS: Based on documents provided by Ennis Center for Children-\nPontiac and information reviewed in MiSACWIS, there is\nsufficient evidence to show that Ennis Center for Children-\nPontiac is in violation of this policy. The agency did not provide\nFoster Parent A written notice at least seven calendar days prior\nto the court hearings which were held on April 18, 2019, May 9,\n2019, August 6, 2019, October 15, 2019, December 19, 2019,\nJanuary 7, 2020, January 16, 2020, March 17, 2020, April 27,\n2020, May 9, 2020, September 11, 2020, and October 13, 2020.\nThe policy does not indicate that caseworkers are required to\nprovide court reports to the child, foster parents, relative\ncaregivers, the non-offending parent, and/or pre-adoptive\nparents.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION#4:\nEnnis Center for Children-Pontiac did not include Foster Parent 1 in case\nplanning or ensure that their input and written statements were provided to the\ncourt.\n10",
    "INVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the Complainant’s letter on February 23, 2021. The letter stated Ennis\nCenter for Children did not include Foster Parent A in the case planning nor did Ennis\nCenter for Children inform Foster Parent A their ability to offer their input and written\nstatements directly to the court at each hearing.\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator, Ennis Center for\nChildren - Pontiac Howell's Satellite Office Director, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac\nFoster Care Worker 1, and Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Supervisor 1\nface-to-face on-site on March 04, 2021. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care\nWorker 1 stated Foster Parent A was invited to all Family Team Meetings (FTMs)\nunless Foster Child A’s parents requested that they not be present at the FTMs. She\nsaid Foster Parent A was invited via email to the FTMs completed on May 29, 2020,\nJune 10, 2020, September 14, 2020, and November 19, 2020. She reported she\nprovided the court with letters from Foster Child A’s pediatrician for the October 13,\n2020 court hearing containing Foster Parent A’s concerns. She stated that foster\nparents were provided with all redacted updated service plans (USPs) and parent\nagency treatment plans (PATPs). Foster Care Worker 1 reported Foster Parent A\nfrequently brought their concerns to the agency and the concerns were addressed with\nthe family. She stated Foster Parent A would frequently write letters to the court\nregarding their concerns and they were submitted to the court. Foster Care Worker 1\nreported Foster Parent A would provide the agency with limited responses during home\nvisits. She said the family would not advise the agency of their concerns during home\nvisits and throughout the case they would bring their concerns to the court and MDHHS.\nShe said each time, the concerns were addressed.\nFoster Care Worker 1 stated occasionally, the referee provided Foster Parent A with an\nopportunity to speak at court hearings. She said at the October 13, 2020 court hearing,\nFoster Parent A’s attorney was able to provide a brief and was able to address the court\non the record on behalf of the family. Foster Care Worker 1 stated she had to stop\nallowing Foster Parent A to supervise parenting time for Foster Child A’s mother\nbecause the foster parents would not provide Foster Care Worker 1 information related\nto when the parenting time occurred and their observations during the parenting time.\nWhen she asked Foster Parent A to provide the information, they refused to provide it to\nher. Foster Care Worker 1 stated Foster Parent A would not always involve Foster\nCare Worker 1 in decision making and would not always bring forth their concerns. She\nsaid when Foster Parent A had concerns that Foster Child A had been sexually abused,\nthey did not contact Child Protective Services, advise Foster Care Worker 1 or Foster\nChild A’s LGAL instead Foster Parent A had a SANE exam performed on Foster Child\nA. She said the SANE exam was done without the consent or knowledge of Ennis\nCenter for Children and Foster Child A’s parents. Foster Care Worker 1 reported Foster\nParent A would not provide Foster Care Worker 1 with information regarding medical\nand dental visits when asked and would only do so once the visit had occurred,\ntherefore, making it impossible for Foster Child A’s parents to attend the visits.\n11",
    "Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator reported on January 14, 2020, he\nprovided Foster Parent A with a written response to the letter they submitted to the\nagency on November 22, 2019. He said the letter included concerns about the agency\nand about Foster Child A’s father. The Chief Administrator stated he, Foster Care\nWorker 1 and MDHHS Foster Care POS Supervisor 1 met with Foster Parent A at\nMDHHS to discuss and address the concerns. He reported as a result of the meeting,\nFoster Care Worker 1 agreed to the following: Foster Care Worker 1 would send a\nletter, a text message, and an email containing the parenting time schedule, Foster\nCare Worker 1 would primarily use written communication to communicate with Foster\nParent A; Foster Parent A would be provided with all USPs and PATPs, and all\nparenting time would be held at Ingham County MDHHS, as Foster Parent A did not\nwant to transport Foster Child A to Ennis Center for Children’s Howell satellite office. He\nreported to accommodate Foster Parent A’s request for parenting visits in Ingham\nCounty, all parenting time was moved to Ingham County despite Foster Child A’s\nmother residing in Genesee County and Foster Child A’s father preferring that the\nparenting time be held at the Howell satellite office.\nI reviewed documents provided by Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac on March 8, 2021,\nMarch 9, 2021, March 11, 2021, March 15, 2021, March 16, 2021, and April 7, 2021.\nThe documents included the following:\n The letter dated November 22, 2019 and written by Foster Parent A included\ntheir recollection of how Foster Child A’s first visit with her father went. The letter\nstated Ennis Center for Children has not always prepared documentation timely\nfor court, completed family planning meetings and reports not being prepared\nand/or filed with the court. The letter also expressed their concerns regarding\nFoster Child A’s father.\n Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator’s letter dated January 14,\n2020 in response to Foster Parent A’s letter on November 22, 2019. The letter\nsummarized what was discussed at the meeting they had with Foster Parent A\non December 16, 2019, including parenting time with Foster Child A’s parents,\ncourt and documents, family member visitation and communication.\n An email dated April 23, 2020 from Foster Care Worker 1 to Foster Parent A ,\nwhich included a USP.\n An email thread dated May 29, 2020 including Foster Parent A and Foster Care\nWorker 1 scheduling a meeting to discuss Foster Parent A’s concerns about\nparenting time.\n Email threads dated June 10, 11, and 12, 2020 including Foster Parent A and\nFoster Care Worker 1 discussing the parenting time schedule for the parents and\nthe purpose of supportive visitation for Foster Child A’s father.\n An email dated September 9, 2020 from Foster Care Worker 1 to Foster Parent\nA informing them of what was discussed at a meeting Foster Care Worker 1 had\nwith MDHHS on September 9, 2020 and the parenting time schedule.\n FTM invitations from Foster Care Worker 1 to Foster Parent A on June 3, 2020,\nSeptember 14, 2020, and November 19, 2020.\n Foster Parent A signed the medical passport on October 30, 2020.\n12",
    " Foster Parent A signed the PATP on May 2, 2020 and September 22, 2020.\nFoster Parent A submitted a written addendum to the October 29, 2020 home\nvisit notes and PATP.\nI reviewed Foster Child A’s case in MiSACWIS on April 13, 2021. Foster Parent A was\ninvited to FTMs that occurred on March 15, 2019, June 18, 2019, November 1, 2019,\nJune 10, 2020, September 14, 2020, and November 19, 2020. They attended the FTMs\non March 15, 2019, June 18, 2019, November 1, 2019, June 10, 2020, and September\n14, 2020. Foster Parent A signed PATPs on April 9, 2019, August 5, 2019, January 24,\n2020, May 7, 2020, and September 22, 2020.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(5) An agency shall involve the foster parents in the\ndevelopment of service plans to enable the foster parents\nto understand the plan for the child and the foster parent’s\nrole in assisting the agency in carrying out the plan.\nANALYSIS: Based on the documents reviewed and the interviews\nconducted, there is insufficient evidence to show that Ennis\nCenter for Children-Pontiac did not include Foster Parent 1 in\ncase planning or ensure that their input and written statements\nwere provided to the court. Foster Parent A provided their input\nregarding the case via FTMs, written letters to the court and\nEnnis Center for Children-Pontiac, emails and via a meeting that\noccurred on December 16, 2019.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION#5:\nEnnis Center for Children-Pontiac initiated special investigations in January 2020\nand September 2020, in which the findings were “bogus.”\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the Complainant’s letter on February 23, 2021. The letter stated Ennis\nCenter for Children repeatedly retaliated against Foster Parent A for speaking up for\nFoster Child A to try to protect her. The letter stated Ennis Center for Children initiated\nunfounded and spurious licensing complaints against Foster Parent A in January 2020\nand September 2020. The letter stated “in the special evaluation report for the\nSeptember 2020 investigation, Ennis Center for Children went so far as to besmirch\nFoster Parent A’s excellent reputation and good moral character by suggesting that they\nhad ‘contradicted’ themselves or ‘not been honest’ with Ennis Center for Children.” The\nletter stated that those were baseless accusations.\n13",
    "I reviewed documents provided by Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac on March 8, 2021,\nMarch 9, 2021, March 11, 2021, March 15, 2021, March 16, 2021, and April 7, 2021.\nThe documents included the following:\n Special evaluation with an intake date of January 8, 2020 alleged that Ennis\nCenter for Children received an email indicating Foster Parent A hired a private\ninvestigator to complete an investigation on Foster Child A’s father. The agency\nfound Foster Parent A in non-compliance with Rules 9201 (i), 9403 (a), 9505 (1)\nand 9505 (2). The assessment of Foster Parent A’s non-compliance was based\non the following: non-compliance of 9201 (i) as Foster Parent A has not\nappropriately demonstrated their ability and willingness to work with Foster Child\nA’s parents as reported by several professionals related to the foster care case;\nnon-compliance of 9403 (a) as Foster Parent A has indicated in the most recent\nPATP that they do not agree with it; and non-compliance of 9505 (1) and (2) as\nFoster Parent A shared confidential information about Foster Child A’s father with\na private investigator, which is not appropriate and a breach of confidentiality. It\nwas also assessed based on the documentation received, the PATP for the\nreporting period of June 19, 2019 to September 16, 2019 was not\nreviewed/provided to Foster Parent A at the time of completion. However, the\nagency reviewed/provided all other PATPs with Foster Parent A. In addition,\nFoster Parent A requested copies of all service plans and redacted copies were\nprovided to the family. Foster Parent A signed a CAP on March 3, 2020.\n Special evaluation with an intake date September 22, 2020 alleged Foster Parent\nA has not cooperated with the agency in the goal of reunification. Foster Parent A\nhas shared confidential information with multiple sources without consent of\nthe agency. The agency found Foster Parent A in non-compliance with Rules\n9403 (a) and 9201 (j). The special evaluation stated based on interviews\ncompleted and the information gathered during this evaluation, it was assessed\nthat Foster Parent A was in non-compliance of licensing rule 9403 (a) as\nthere was documentation that indicated that Foster Parent A shared information\nwith individuals outside of their designated role/care to prevent Foster Child A\nfrom reunifying with her father, thus not cooperating with the service plan and\npermanency goal of Foster Child A. This was identified as a repeat violation for\nFoster Parent A. The special evaluation stated although it was noted that Foster\nParent A are relative care providers, which could have led to the family's over\ninvolvement in the foster care case, as licensed foster parents they are required\nto adhere to all State and agency licensing policies.\n Email threads dated October 23, 2020, December 14, 2020, December 15, 2020,\nDecember 18, 2020, December 23, 2020, January 17, 2021, January 19, 2021\nand February 8, 2021 included communications to and from DCWL Compliance\nand Regulatory Action Unit Manager regarding how to proceed with the special\nevaluation as Foster Parent A refused to sign the CAP for the September 2020\nspecial evaluation.\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Licensing Supervisor 1 via telephone on\nApril 13, 2020. Licensing Supervisor 1 reported Rules 9201 (i), 9403 (a), 9505 (1) and\n14",
    "9505 (2) were cited for the first special evaluation. She said noncompliance was\ndetermined for all cited violations as it was found through interviews with service\nproviders that Foster Parent A did not demonstrate any willingness to work with the\nFoster Child A’s parents and Foster Parent A indicated they would not comply with the\nPATP. She reported it was found that Foster Parent A disclosed confidential information\nabout Foster Child A’s father to a private investigator. Licensing Supervisor 1 reported\nduring the first special evaluation, it was reported to the agency that Foster Parent A\nhired this private investigator for the safety of themselves and their daughter, who is\nFoster Child A’s mother. Licensing Supervisor 1 reported Rules 9403 (a) and 9201 (j)\nwere cited for the second special evaluation. She said noncompliance was determined\nfor Rule 9403(a) and compliance was determined for 9505 (1). She said there was an\nadditional finding of Rule 9201(j) as it was found that Foster Parent A was not truthful\nduring the first special evaluation. She reported during the first investigation, it was\nreported to the agency that Foster Parent A hired the private investigator for the safety\nof themselves and Foster Child A’s mother. She said however, for the second\nevaluation, the agency obtained the special investigator’s report that indicated that\nFoster Parent A obtained the private investigator for the purpose of finding information\non Foster Child A’s father that would be helpful in preventing the father from getting\ncustody. Licensing Supervisor 1 stated confidentiality was found in non-compliance in\nthe first special evaluation, however, they were found in compliance of confidentiality in\nthe second special evaluation.\nI reviewed Foster Child A’s case in MiSACWIS on April 13, 2021. I reviewed the\nsupporting documents Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac reviewed for both special\nevaluations. Included was a letter dated August 28, 2020 written by Foster Child A’s\npediatrician contained specific details pertaining to Foster Child A’s parenting time with\nher father and her assessment of Foster Child A’s father’s lack of interest in Foster\nChild A. The report dated January 15, 2019 and completed by the private investigator\nhired by Foster Parent A stated Foster Parent A stated “they were interested in looking\ninto the background of Foster Child A’s father to present the court with any information\nthat might be helpful in preventing Foster Child A’s father from obtaining custody of\nFoster Child A.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of\nthe following information:\n(e) Findings of fact, based upon the evaluation.\n15",
    "ANALYSIS: Per Rule 400.12327 (1) Special evaluation, an agency is\nrequired to initiate a special evaluation, when the agency\nreceives information that relates to possible noncompliance with\nany foster home rule. Based on the interviews conducted and\nthe documents reviewed, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac\ninitiated a special evaluation against Foster Parent A when they\nreceived information of possible noncompliance with foster\nhome rules by Foster Parent A. The agency reviewed several\ndocuments and completed interviews to conclude that Foster\nParent A were in violation of foster home licensing rules. There\nis no indication that the agency is in violation of the rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION#6:\nEnnis Center for Children-Pontiac has cancelled numerous visits and now\nrefuses to complete the annual licensing inspection because Foster Parent 1\nrefused to sign the corrective action plan (CAP) for a special investigation.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the Complainant’s letter on February 23, 2021. The letter stated Ennis\nCenter for Children has delayed the annual foster care review, cancelled and then\npostponed multiple times the final home visit and has refused to complete the annual\nreview because Foster Parent A refused to sign the “baseless and unnecessary CAP\nthat was tied to the baseless and defamatory September 2020 licensing investigation.”\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator, Ennis Center for\nChildren - Pontiac Howell's Satellite Office Director, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac\nFoster Care Worker 1, and Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Supervisor 1\nface-to-face on-site on March 04, 2021. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care\nWorker 1 stated she reviewed the Children’s Foster Home Licensing Technical\nAssistance (TA) Manual and it states “annual inspections should not be completed until\nthe investigation is completed as no payments are held up due to an annual inspection\nnot being completed timely. A note should be in the file that the annual inspection will be\ncompleted when the special evaluation is complete.” Ennis Center for Children provided\nthe section of the TA manual that includes the information Foster Care Worker 1\nreferenced.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(1) An agency shall conduct an annual on-site and\ncomplete a written reevaluation of a foster home.\n16",
    "ANALYSIS: Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac is in compliance with the rule.\nThe Children’s Foster Home Licensing TA Manual states\n“annual inspections should not be completed until the\ninvestigation is completed as no payments are held up due to an\nannual inspection not being completed timely. A note should be\nin the file that the annual inspection will be completed when the\nspecial evaluation is complete.” Since there is an open special\nevaluation against Foster Parent A, an annual inspection is not\nrequired.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION#7:\nDuring COVID-19 closures, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac made Foster Parent\n1 transport Foster Child A to visits.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the Complainant’s letter on February 23, 2021. The letter stated during the\nCOVID-19 closures and while the governor’s stay-at-home orders were in effect, Ennis\nCenter for Children made Foster Parent A transport Foster Child A to the exchange\npoint for Foster Child A to visit his father. The letter stated this was during a time when\npersons of different households were not to visit one another.\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator, Ennis Center for\nChildren - Pontiac Howell's Satellite Office Director, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac\nFoster Care Worker 1, and Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Supervisor 1\nface-to-face on-site on March 04, 2021. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care\nWorker 1 stated one of the days Foster Child A’s mother would visit with Foster Child A\nwas on a Friday, when Foster Child A’s father would typically have had Foster Child A\nfor parenting time. She said it was determined by Ennis Center for Children’s upper\nmanagement that a worker would always be present for all pick up and drop offs of\nFoster Child A with her father. The father’s parenting time would begin following the\nconclusion of the mother’s parenting time on Fridays. She said as licensed foster\nparents, the agency expected Foster Parent A to transport Foster Child A to parenting\ntime and they would be reimbursed for mileage. Foster Care Worker 1 reported she\nadvised Foster Parent A that she could transport Foster Child A from Ennis Center for\nChildren’s Howell satellite office to the father’s home following the conclusion of the\nmother’s parenting time so Foster Parent A did not have to make a second trip back to\nHowell and since Foster Care Worker 1 would have to be present for the drop off. She\nstated Foster Parent A refused her offer and said they did not feel comfortable with “a\nstranger [Foster Care Worker 1] driving Foster Child A.” Foster Care Worker 1 said she\noffered to assist with transportation for parenting time at the October 29, 2020 home\nvisit at Foster Parent A’s home and on October 30, 2020 at Ennis Center for Children,\nhowever, they stated they would transport Foster Child A. Foster Care Worker 1\n17",
    "showed me a letter dated November 6, 2020 and written by Foster Parent A, which\nstated Foster Child A needed to be transported by Foster Parent A.\nFoster Care Worker 1 indicated that due to the agency’s COVID-19 restrictions, all\ncaregivers dropping and picking children up for parenting time must remain in their\nvehicles during the parenting time. She said they may not sit in the waiting room, as to\nminimize exposure and minimize the amount of people in the building. She reported\nFoster Parent A was never inside the building during the drop offs, as Foster Child A\nwould be handed off to the mother outside the building while Foster Care Worker 1\nwatched. She said the room was void of all toys, properly disinfected, and all people\ninvolved during the parenting time would have temperatures taken and they would\ncomplete a questionnaire regarding COVID-19. Foster Care Worker 1 stated the\nagency was unable to complete parenting time at Ingham county MDHHS as requested\nby Foster Parent A due to MDHHS COVID-19 restrictions. She reported she was unable\nto find parenting time locations near Ingham County to hold the visits due to COVID-19.\nShe said the mother lived in Genesee county and was thirty minutes from the Howell\nsatellite office and an hour away from Lansing. Due to this and COVID-19 restrictions,\nFoster Care Worker 1 said parenting time was moved to Howell to best accommodate\nFoster Child A’s mother.\nI reviewed Foster Child A’s case in MiSACWIS on April 13, 2021. I reviewed a\ndocument that included detailed dates and information describing issues the agency\nhad with Foster Parent A’s inability to participate in video visits with Foster Child A’s\nfather beginning in March 2020 when virtual parenting time was to occur until June\n2020, when in-person parenting time could resume. There were times when Foster\nParent A said they were unable to connect to video software in order to conduct the\nparenting time or not answering the telephone when Foster Child A’s father called for\nparenting time.\nI reviewed MDHHS Communication Issuance 20-032, which allowed parenting time to\noccur via allowable alternatives including phone calls, Microsoft Teams, FaceTime,\nSkype, Zoom, or other technology. I reviewed MDHHS Communication Issuance 20-\n032* which stated beginning May 28, 2020 and no later than June 11, 2020, agencies\nmust resume in-person parenting time and sibling visits using locally developed plans.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nAn agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nparenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Provisions for visits between parents and children\nexcept where parental rights have been terminated or when\nthere is a court determination that visits are detrimental to\nthe child.\n18",
    "ANALYSIS: Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac did not violate MDHHS\nparenting time protocols that were issued during COVID-19. At\nthe beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, parenting time for\nFoster Child A was occurring virtually. Ennis Center for\nChildren-Pontiac documented issues that were occurring with\nFoster Parent A being unable to complete virtual parenting time\nwith Foster Child A’s father. Once parenting time resumed to in-\nperson, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac attempted to assist\nFoster Parent A with transporting Foster Child A to parenting\ntime, however, they declined the assistance citing Foster Parent\nA needed to transport Foster Child A to parenting time.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION#8:\nEnnis Center for Children-Pontiac failed to respond to Foster Parent A’s Freedom\nof Information Act (FOIA) requests.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the Complainant’s letter on February 23, 2021. The letter stated Ennis\nCenter for Children violated Foster Parent A’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nrequests by failing to respond timely. The letter stated Ennis Center for Children\nretained an attorney who wrote Foster Parent A’s attorney that the agency “is not\nsubject to” the FOIA.\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator, Ennis Center for\nChildren - Pontiac Howell's Satellite Office Director, Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac\nFoster Care Worker 1, and Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Supervisor 1\nface-to-face on-site on March 04, 2021. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief\nAdministrator stated the agency’s attorney provided Foster Parent A’s attorney with a\nwritten response to the FOIA request on December 3, 2020. He reported since Ennis\nCenter for Children is not a public agency, they are not subject to FOIA. He stated\nFoster Parent A requested all internal foster care policies and foster care manual. He\nsaid the agency referred Foster Parent A back to the MDHHS policy manual and made\nsure they had their policies signed by the agency.\nI reviewed documents provided by Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac on March 8, 2021,\nMarch 9, 2021, March 11, 2021, March 15, 2021, March 16, 2021, and April 7, 2021.\nThe documents included the following:\n The letter from Foster Parent A’s attorney dated November 18, 2020 requesting\nall internal foster care policies and foster care manual, Foster Care Worker 1 and\nFoster Care Supervisor 1’s personnel records, all complaints, inquiries, letters,\nemails, calls correspondence and/or other communications received by Ennis\nCenter for Children concerning Foster Care Worker 1 and Foster Care\n19",
    "Supervisor 1, and all records of and/or documenting internal Ennis Center for\nChildren communications concerning Foster Care Worker 1 and Foster Care\nSupervisor 1’s actions taken with respect to Foster Parent A.\n The letter from Ennis Center for Children’s attorney dated December 3, 2020 in\nresponse to Foster Parent A’s attorney’s request for documents on November\n18, 2020.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12328 Foster home record.\n(3) An agency shall make copies of a record available to\nthe applicant or licensee upon request, except for the\nfollowing items:\n(a) Pending evaluation reports and documents.\n(b) Records of privileged communication.\n(c) Criminal records, police reports, child protective\nservices information, and social security numbers from any\nsource.\nANALYSIS: Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac is not in violation of the rule\nas they provided a written response to the FOIA request to\nFoster Parent A’s attorney via their attorney. The Chief\nAdministrator said the agency referred Foster Parent A back to\nthe MDHHS policy manual and made sure they had their\npolicies signed by the agency.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend no change in the\nlicense status.\nApril 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nAlicia Wiggins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 5, 2021\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n20"
