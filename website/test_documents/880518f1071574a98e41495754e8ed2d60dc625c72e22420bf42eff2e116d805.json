    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection • (2) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster\nDescription child, and the foster parent, if applicable, in the child's\nplacement at least once every month.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster parents denied home visit was completed in February, yet\na home visit was documented 2/27/24.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Complainant on 4/8/2024. Complainant said Foster\nParent reported Foster Care Worker, assigned to Youth A had not\ncompleted a foster home visit in February 2024. Complainant\nreported when Complainant accessed the information system for\nYouth A, a foster home visit was documented for 2/27/24.\nComplainant stated she subsequently contacted the agency\nregarding this documentation. Complainant stated the entry was\nsubsequently deleted in the case record.\nI interviewed Foster Care Supervisor on 6/3/2024 regarding the\ndocumentation issue. Foster Care Supervisor stated the 2/27/24\ndate was when supervision was completed with Foster Care\nWorker. Foster Care Supervisor stated the Foster Care Worker\nhad entered a \"placeholder\" date in the record and the date of the\ncompleted home visit for February occurred on 2/7/24. Foster\nCare Supervisor stated Foster Care Worker had additional visits to\nthe foster home of Youth A in February when transporting Youth A\nfor parenting time on February 2, 12, and 26.\nI interviewed the Foster Parent by phone on 6/4/2024. Foster\nParent confirmed Foster Care Worker had been to the home\ndifferent times in February during the transportation of Youth A for\nparenting time but denied a foster home visit had occurred in\nFebruary.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator by phone on 6/27/2024. Chief\nAdministrator indicated the workers at one time did have a\n“placeholder” system for entry/documentation purposes, but the\nagency is in the process of discontinuing that practice. It was not\na formal written policy/procedure.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker by phone on 6/27/2024. Foster\nCare Worker stated she had completed the foster home visit\ndocumented on 2/7/2024. Foster Care Worker indicated the\n2",
    "2/7/2024 visit included transporting Youth A for a parenting visit,\nbut Foster Care Worker was also in the home to observe/complete\nthe foster home visit requirements. Foster Care Worker stated\nthere were also additional times when she was in the home as a\npart of completing her case management responsibilities.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nMiSACWIS case file review: A review of the case record for Youth\nA indicated a foster home visit by Foster Care Worker was\ncompleted on 2/7/2024 and entered into MiSACWIS on 4/4/24.\nYouth A was observed to be doing well in this foster home\nplacement. The verification of well-being contact was as follows:\n“Caseworker met with Youth A during an announced foster home\nvisit. Due to his age, Youth A is unable to communicate regarding\nplacement, behavior management or his time in care. Youth A\ncontinues to sleep in a crib where safe sleep continues to be\nfollowed. Youth A continues to engage in Early On appointments\non a bi-weekly basis. Upon walkthrough of the home, it appears\nappropriate with no safety concerns. Foster parents continue to\nreport that Youth A is eating well but does not sleep through the\nnight. Youth A continues to exhibit a strong bond with his foster\nmom as he seeks comfort from her. Youth A is up to date on his\nwell child exams. Foster parents have not reported any concerns\nfollowing Youth A's return from his supervised parenting time\nvisits. Foster parents report utilizing supervision for behavior\nmanagement due to Youth A's age. Youth A is able to sit\nindependently and is able to hold his bottle”.\nThe social work contacts for February 2024 and the updated\nservice plan for the time period 1/30/2024-4/26/2024, approved\n4/26/2024, were reviewed as a part of this special investigation.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as there isn’t enough\ninformation to say otherwise. Foster Care Worker stated she\nvisited the home on 2/7/24 and documented the visit two months\nlater on the date of the complaint. The Foster Parent reported a\nhome visit didn’t occur.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTechnical assistance was provided to the agency as a part of this\ninvestigation to modify the agency's documentation procedures\nwithin the information system and no longer utilize the use of\n\"placeholders\", and only enter the information for social work\ncontacts upon their completion.\n3",
    "Consultation\nConsultation was offered to remind staff that face-to-face required\nsocial work contacts are to be entered into the system in a timely\nmanner. MDHHS policy requires they be entered within 5 days.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n7/1/2024\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 1, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
