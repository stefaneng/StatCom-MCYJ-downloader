FCW\nworker stated she had not, and this was visit time so Parent\nshould be focusing on that. Parent continued arguing with FCW\nand Relative Caregiver 1. Due to her being verbally aggressive\n(swearing and threatening) and refusing to focus on visiting with\nthe children, the visit was cancelled. Parent initially refused to\nleave but eventually did. This was the only visit canceled in person\nby FCW. Another visit was canceled on 5/30/25 as Parent refused\nto confirm the visit time with the agency.\nFCW explained when Parent initially arrived at the visit, she put\nher belongings on top of the papers that FCW was going over with\n2",
