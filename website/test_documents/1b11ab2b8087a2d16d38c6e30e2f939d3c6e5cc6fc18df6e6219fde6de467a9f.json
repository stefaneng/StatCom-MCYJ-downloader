    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency had one CAP during this review period, as a result of the January\n2022 renewal inspection. The agency reported successful implementation and\ncompliance in the areas addressed in the CAP. This renewal review found the\nagency has shown significant compliance in most areas. However, there were\ntwo repeat violations identified regarding updated IL contracts and closing\ndocumentation. The agency will develop a new CAP to address this item.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Annual Assessment (CAA) was reviewed. The agency\nreported successful implementation of their CAP and some additional changes,\nunrelated to the CAP, which benefited the program over the past year. The CAA\naddressed some of the current violations, with changes in tracking and utilizing\nchecklists to ensure items are completed. These strategies will be included in\nthe new CAP developed for the 2023 interim evaluation. In addition, the CAA\nidentified an issue with some DHHS cases that were not assigned correctly in\nMISACWIS, which caused incorrect information in the system and in the\nagency's key performance indicators. However, they continue to work with the\nDHHS monitor to address this area.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were found.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed during this review. Both staff report they feel there\nwere positive improvements over the past year to address concerns with IL youth\nthat struggled in the program. Some staff changes were made, in addition to\npartnering with community services. Overall, staff did not have any concerns\nabout the agency or suggestions for improvement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to work out of the same building. However, it has\nexpanded the available office space. The office was found to be clean and\nsufficient for required duties, with adequate secured storage.\n5",
    "VII. ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis is a non-contracted, IL only program. Therefore, an analyst review was not\nrequired.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_______________March 14, 2023_________________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 14, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
