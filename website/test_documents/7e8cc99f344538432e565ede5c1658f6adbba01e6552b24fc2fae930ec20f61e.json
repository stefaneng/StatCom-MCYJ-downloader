    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency interim inspection was completed on 2/21/2024 and the CAP approved on\n4/19/2024. The agency was cited for 10 violations, 5 of which were repeated this\nyear. Of those 5, there was a slight improvement in individual incidents of non-\ncompliance within two of the violation areas and remaining 3 areas stayed the\nsame. In 2023, 3 violations were established, 1 of which was repeated this year.\nThe agency will need to establish additional corrective planning for the repeated\nviolations to ensure a reduction of incidents.\nSpecial investigation 2025SIC0000109 was completed on 1/10/2025 and the CAP\nis pending. The agency was found in non-compliance with PA 116 as a foster\nyouth's case record included information that was not truthful or accurate. The\nagency is expected to comply with the action steps of their CAP once it is\napproved.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated that there have been difficulties throughout the year due to not having\nadequate, competent staff as well as frequent turnover. The assessment noted a\nplan moving forward to address licensing requirements. She is confident there will\nbe noticeable improvement.\nFinancial Overview\nFinancial information was requested from the agency in the CPA letter as well as a\nfollow up email but was not provided.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nAn interview was conducted with one staff via teleconference. Staff reported the\nagency has struggled with turnover and it has impacted overall compliance.

All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nSafety Alert #1: The home has a swimming pool, and the house is used as a barrier.\nThe door leading to the pool is locked, but it is not out of reach of children, and it is\nnot self-latching/self-closing. In addition, the home is missing a smoke alarm\nbetween the foster children's bedroom and the rest of the home.\nResolution: The foster parents purchased a device that will allow the sliding glass\ndoor leading to the pool to self-latch/self-close. A door alarm is used that is triggered\nas soon as the door is open and has a unique sound from the other alarms in the\nhome. Photos were submitted as verification. A smoke detector was installed in the\nproper location. A photo was submitted as verification.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n________2/7/2025_________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 10, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
