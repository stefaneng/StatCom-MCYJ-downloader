    "II. ALLEGATION(S)\nViolation\nEstablished?\nStaff member called resident the \"B-Word\" in response to Yes\nresident's cursing at her.\nAdditional Findings No\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n06/22/2020 Special Investigation Intake\n2020C0214035\n06/23/2020 Special Investigation Initiated - Face to Face interviews with\nResident A, Staff 1, and Administrator 1.\n06/23/2020 Documents received – Facesheet, treatment plan,\npolicy/procedure, and personnel file.\n06/23/2020 Inspection Completed On-site\n07/28/2020 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nStaff member called resident the \"B-Word\" in response to resident's cursing at her.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Resident A on 6/23/2020 at the facility. She reports that she first\ncalled Staff 1 a “bitch” and Staff 1 responded by saying “don’t’ call me a bitch”. She\nalso reports there were no others present at this time and it occurred in the\nkitchen/dining room area. She reported that she also threw food at Staff 1, hitting\nher, and Staff 1 responded by grabbing her arm to make her stop. She reports that\nshe was angry because Staff 1 wanted her to slow down eating her snack. By her\nreport this occurred just prior to her calling Staff 1 a bitch. She ended by reporting\nthat she feels safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 6/23/2020 at the facility. She reports that both she and\nResident A were in the dining room playing cards when Resident A requested a\nsnack. She reports giving Resident A gram crackers for a snack. She reported that\nResident A was “shoving her gram crackers in her mouth and I feared that she\nwould choke”. Staff 1 reported that she said something to Resident A and Resident\nA replied, “that’s why I don’t like you bitch”. Staff 1 stated, “I don’t remember what I\nsaid to her, but she started turning over the chairs and table”. Staff 1 also stated, “I\ncould have said “don’t call me a bitch, but I don’t remember, and I am nervous”.",
    "Staff 1 reported that using the word “bitch” would be inappropriate even if just saying\nit for an example. She also reported that other staff came into the area and switched\nout with her to help de-escalate Resident A. Staff 1 reported that she is trained to\nrespond in positive ways to residents no matter what they say to her.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 on 6/23/2020 at the facility. She reports being\naware of the incident and that the interaction was caught on video tape. She also\nreports that there is no audio with the video recording.\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed the incident report of the allegations. The incident report was written by a\nstaff who no longer works at the facility, who overhead Resident A sharing the\nincident during a phone call. Documentation indicates that this staff spoke with\nResident A after the phone call to get clarifying information. The description of the\nincident written closely matches the verbal reports of both Resident A and Staff 1.\nAdditional information in the incident report includes a statement by Resident A that\nStaff 1 told her to “sit her little butt down before you get whooping you bitch”.\nResident A and Staff 1 never reported that this statement was made during the\ninterviews. The incident report is dated June 17, 2020.\nI reviewed Resident A’s treatment plan. The goals for Resident A are to find\nplacement within 30-days. Her strengths and goals are identified. Issues involve\nsignificant trauma, low IQ, and language impairments.\nI reviewed the program’s procedure manual. Under the “prohibited practices” section\nit is documented that “verbal abuse, ridicule or humiliation” are prohibited. The\ndocument outlines the appropriate de-escalation techniques that staff are to use\nwhich includes verbal communication in an effort to “maintain healthy\ncommunication and reduce the likelihood of behaviors escalating”.\nI reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. There is documentation that Staff 1 has\ncompleted the required training (over 90-hours in the past couple of years) and\nreceived her annual evaluations. There is no evidence of any disciplinary action\ntaken with Staff 1.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nsupervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these\nadministrative rules and in the agency's program statement and\nto provide for the continual needs, protection, and supervision of\nresidents.",
    "ANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews and written\ndocumentation do support the allegations of staff not following\nthe facility policy/procedure when dealing with Resident A. By all\naccounts, it appears that Staff 1 used profanity when addressing\nResident A who was struggling emotionally at the time. Resident\nA struggles with trauma, has a low IQ, and language\nimpairments.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nThis is a repeat violation from Special Investigation\n2019C0223038 with an approved CAP on 6/28/19,\nSpecial Investigation 2019C0214046 with an\napproved CAP on 8/30/19, and Special Investigation\n2019C0214023 with an approved CAP on 3/28/19\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nWith an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that no change be\nmade to the license of this child caring institution\n7/28/2020\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 3, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager"
