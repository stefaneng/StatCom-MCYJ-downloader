    "ALLEGATION 3. Monthly foster home visits are missed.\nALLEGATION 4. Transfers are completed without borrowed bed agreements\nsigned.\nALLEGATION 5. Files are not organized and missing.\nALLEGATION 6. Special evaluations are not completed.\nINVESTIGATION:\nIt should be noted that this Consultant attempted to contact the referral source on\nseveral occasions by way of telephone calls and an email to discuss the\nallegations. However, the telephone number was not a working telephone number\nand the email address does not exit. It is noted that the referral source provided\ninadequate information to be contacted therefore, additional and specific\ninformation was not provided to properly investigate allegations 1-5. Allegations 1 –\n5 were investigated by way of case records and a tour through the\nagencies where case records are stored. The results were as follows:\nAllegation 1. Facility fails to fulfill contract requirements. This statement is\nvery vague and there is no clear understanding of what the referral source\nmeant by this statement. More clarification was needed from the referral\nsource.\nAllegation 2. Foster homes have not had yearly visits updated reports.\nAllegation 3. Monthly foster home visits are missed.\nI reviewed a random selection of four foster home case records. There were\nno violations with these records regarding home visits. Foster home visits\nwere made, and it was noted that the Division Director visited some of the foster\nhomes to ensure compliance and to make sure the youth in these homes were\nsafe. This consultant conducted an Interim Inspection Report September of 2022.\nThere were no citations noted regarding foster home visits or annual/renewal\nupdated service plans. Documentation was noted in service plans and MiSACWIS.\nAllegation 4. Transfers are completed without borrowed bed agreements\nsigned.\nThe agency had one borrowed bed. In review of this borrowed bed case\nrecord, the agency had citations. The bed was borrowed, and it was cited in\nthe agency Interim Inspection Report dated September 8, 2022, that the case\nrecord did not have documentation for the rule. The borrowed bed agreement was\nnot signed by the foster parent and the borrowing agency. See Interim Inspection\nReport dated September 8, 2022. The agency submitted an acceptable corrective\naction plan (CAP) and the CAP is still under review for this citation.\nAllegation 5. Files are not organized and missing. This statement was\nvague and needs additional information from the referral source who\n611 W. OTTAWA • P.O. BOX 30664 • LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/lara • 517-335-1980",
    "provided no reliable contact information. It was unclear of what files are\nmissing or unorganized.\nAllegation 6. Special evaluations are not completed.\nI interviewed the Division Director regarding the allegation made regarding special\ninvestigations not being completed timely. The Division Director reported that this\ninformation is true. She said there were three investigations that were initiated but\nwas not completed in a timely manner. The Division Director reported that the\nagency experience significant staff turnover that was much greater than previous\nyears. She said the average tenure of staff is six months to one year. The Division\nDirector reported that she had to hire licensing staff because the staff and supervisor\nall left the agency around the same time leaving unfinished special investigation\nreport unfinished.\nI interviewed the Licensing Supervisor. She has been in the position since August of\n2022 and newly hired. She explained that she is working diligently with her\nsupervisor to complete the special investigations that were initiated by another\nlicensing worker and supervisor who are no longer at the agency. She said there\nwere several special investigations that were not completed timely.\nI interviewed the Director of Operations and she said she was aware of the special\ninvestigations that were not completed timely. They were as follows:\nSpecial investigation SI# 2021C0630170 was initiated on 08/19/21. The special\ninvestigation was not completed as of 09/07/2022. The same investigation does not\nhave a conclusion based on the noncompliance and the findings of facts.\nSpecial investigation SI#2022C0630986 was initiated on 05/06/2022. This special\ninvestigation was not completed as of 09/07/2022. The report was missing Rule\n12327 parts 3, 5f, 5h, 6a, 6b, 6c, and 7 of the rule.\nSpecial investigation SI#2022C630008 was initiated on 09/10/2021 and was\ncompleted on 08/17/2022. The report required a corrective action plan. There was\nno corrective action plan for this special investigation.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(3) An agency shall complete a special evaluation within 45\ncalendar days after receipt of the information. If additional\ntime is required, then the agency shall inform the foster\nparent, in writing, of the basis for the extension and the\nexpected length of the extension. The total time for the\ncompletion of the investigation shall not exceed 90\n611 W. OTTAWA • P.O. BOX 30664 • LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/lara • 517-335-1980",
    "calendar days without written approval from the chief\nadministrator or his or her designee.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of\nthe following information:\n(f) Conclusions regarding licensing rules compliance or\nnoncompliance based on the findings of fact.\n(h) Recommendations regarding licensing action and any\nrequired corrective action.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(a) Provide the foster parent with a copy of the report\nrequired by subrule (5) of this rule within 10 calendar days\nof its completion.\n(b) Inform the foster parent, in writing that he or she has a\nright to have his or her written response included as an\nattachment to the report required by subrule (5) of this rule.\n(c) Provide a copy of the report to any social services\nworker that has children placed in the home.\n(7) If any violations are cited and there is a signed\ncorrective action plan, all social service workers who have\nchildren placed in the home shall be notified there is a\ncorrective action plan and what is required of the foster\nparent in that plan.\nANALYSIS: The referral source could not be contacted for this investigation\nand provided inadequate contact information.\nThere were violations with the one case the agency had\nregarding borrowed beds. There was a corrective action plan\nsubmitted in September of 2022, this citation is in the interim\nreport and is still under review.\nThe Division Director, Director of Operations and Licensing\nSupervisor all admitted that there were special investigation\nreports that were not completed, and they were working on\ncompleting the special investigations and will make them their\npriority. The agency is in violation with not completing special\ninvestigations timely.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n611 W. OTTAWA • P.O.
