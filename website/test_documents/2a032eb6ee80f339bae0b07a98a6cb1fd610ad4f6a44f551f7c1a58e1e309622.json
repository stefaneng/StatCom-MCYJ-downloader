She reported she requested a removal of Youth A from\nher home due to his behaviors of biting, hitting, and scratching\nhimself. She said he was also removing scabs until he bled. The\nfoster parent said she was not informed by the agency on the\nagency policies of what needed to be reported and what did not\nneed to be reported to the assigned foster care worker. She said\nshe became very concerned when she was investigated by DHHS\nand the agency for not reporting incidents on the children in her\ncare and when the children were removed from her home. She\nreported she did not understand why the children was being\nremoved because the agency did not explain this process to her.\nShe reported that Youth A had numerous medical issues and due\nto having two younger children in her home that she did not have\nprior to Youth A being place in the home, she could not provide\nthe attention that Youth A needed. She stated she was not\nprovided services to assist with Youth A’s behaviors.\nIt was noted that the foster parents signed and dated all of\nthe agency policies and procedures including the parent\nagency agreement on 9/15/2022.\nChief Administrator:\n2",
    "The Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed on 4/25/2023, via\nvideo conference. She reported that Youth A was placed in the\nfoster home for a year and was in the process of being adopted by\nthe foster parents. She said Youth A was diagnosed with Solitary\nkidney, DiGeorge Syndrome, Developmental Delay, Sleep Apnea,\nand a Cleft Palate. The CA reported that the Foster Care Worker\nattempted to contact the foster parents via their cell phones and\nhome phone on 03/30/2023 at 3:00 p.m. immediately upon being\nadvised by Ennis Center’s Risk team that the children should be\nremoved pending the DHHS investigation, but they did not answer\nthe phone. She said a voicemail was left for the foster parent to\nreturn the call regarding an urgent matter. She said the agency\nsuccessfully contacted the foster parent on 03/30/2023 at 5:00\np.m. and informed her that the children were being temporarily\nremoved pending the DHHS investigation due to alleged abuse\nand neglect. The children were removed on 03/30/2023 at 6:30\np.m. and the DHS 30 was emailed to the foster parent on\n03/30/2023 at 6:59 p.m. She said the foster parents returned the\nsigned DHS 30 on 03/31/2023 in person at the Ennis Center\noffice.\nThe CA provided a timeline of services offered to the foster\nparents by the agency with the assistance of the foster care\nworker and the adoption worker to assist with Youth A’s\nbehaviors.

These forms were signed by the\nfoster parents and dated 3/30/2023.\n• MiSACWIS case notes regarding training/resources\nprovided to the foster parents by the agency.\n4",
    "• Agency policy and procedures signed and dated by the\nfoster parents.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation, there is insufficient\nevidence to support the allegations; that the social service workers\ndid not work directly with the children, their families, and other\nrelevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, for the children and their families.\nThere is sufficient evidence to support that the foster parent was\nexplained the reason why the children in her home was being\nremoved.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12405 Change of placement.\nSection (3) The agency shall document all of the following in the child’s\nDescription record before a change of placement occurs:\n(a) Reason for the change in placement.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation False allegations were made against the foster parents regarding\nchild abuse when the foster parents requested a 30-day removal\nof a child who was no longer in the home due to the child self-\nharming.\nInvestigation Foster Parent:\nAfter several attempts were made to contact the Foster Parent, I\ninterviewed her on 4/6/2023, by telephone. She reported false\nallegations were made against her by the assigned adoption\nworker because the adoption worker was upset with her because\nshe rescinded her request to adopt Youth A. She reported DHHS\ncame to her home and completed an investigation, and the\nallegations were not substantiated. She reported the agency also\nmade allegations against her home and placed her on a corrective\naction plan and removed the children in her home. She wanted to\nknow how she could reduce the length of time for the corrective\naction plan (six months) so it will not interfere with her planned\nadoption in the fall of a sibling group. The Foster Parent did not\ntake any responsibility for her own actions regarding the recent\nincidents that occurred in her home regarding the well-being of the\nchildren in her home. She admitted that she did not report all of\nthe incidents that occurred with Youth A because she was not\naware that she had to report every time Youth A injured himself.\nShe provided an example of Youth A falling in the basement\n5",
    "where he received bruises on his back. She said she did not\nreport this incident because she contributed it to a child bruising\nhimself while playing on the playground.\nChief Administrator:\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed on 3/29/2023. In\nresponse to why Youth A was removed from Foster Home 1, she\nreported the following: The foster care worker (FCW) received a\ntelephone call from the current foster care placement (Foster\nParent 2) of Youth A who reported that she had a conversation\nwith the previous foster care, (Foster Parent 1) who reported\ndisturbing information. The current foster parent (Foster Parent 2)\nreported that Foster Parent 1 told her that while Youth A was\nplaced in her home, she was holding Youth A down and her\nhusband thought she was hurting Youth A and that her husband\npushed her off Youth A. Foster Parent 2 told the FCW that Youth\nA was bleeding from his penis and expressed that he self-harmed\nwhile sitting on the potty. The Chief Administrator reported that\nYouth A had a well child examination on 3/23/23, and the doctor\nfound scars and bruises on Youth A’s back which his primary\nphysician stated the bruises were in unusual location to be\ninflicted by self-harm. She said a DHHS report was file on Foster\nParent 1’s home after getting this information. The CA noted a\nspecial investigation was already in progress on Foster Parents 1\nhome due to an incident that occurred on 3/13/2023 where Youth\nB was severely burned from grabbing hot coffee from a Keurig\nresulting in an overnight stay at the hospital for treatment to the\nburns. She said Centralized Intake denied the complaint due to\nthe injuries being consistent with the report from the foster parent.\nThe CA reported due to it being unclear if Youth A actually self-\nharmed that resulted in his penis bleeding and the unexplained\nmarks/bruises on his back the agency erred on the side of caution\nand decided to temporarily remove the remaining children from\nthe home pending the outcome of the investigation.\nAdoption worker:\nI interviewed the adoption worker regarding the allegation of\nmaking false statements against the foster parents due to the\nfoster parents rescinding their intent to adopt Youth A. The\nAdoption worker denied the allegation. She reported she was\nvery involved during the time of the foster parent’s intent to adopt\nYouth A. She reported she completed the paperwork needed for\nadoption for Foster Parents 1 and during the visit the family was\nexcited for the adoption to be completed and signed all legal\ndocuments. She said the following week during a foster care visit\nthe foster parent told the foster care worker she wanted Youth A\n6",
    "to be removed from their home as soon as possible and that she\nno longer wanted to adopt him. The adoption worker said she\nwas informed by the foster care worker that the foster parents no\nlonger wanted to adopt Youth A, because her family was not\nbonding with him and that she did not love Youth A. She said she\ncontacted the foster family to confirm the information given to her\nby the FCW. She said during this time, the Foster Parent told her\nthat she never wanted Youth A, did not love Youth A, and wanted\nhim out of her home immediately. She said there was no\nconcerns or incidents that triggered this behavior from the foster\nparent. The adoption worker said at no time did she threaten or\nwas angry for the foster parent rescinding her intent to adopt\nYouth A. She said she was concerned about the trauma of the\nremoval of Youth A from the home and the lack of empathy and\nunderstanding for Youth A by the foster parents after having him\nin their home for over a year.\nFoster Care Worker:\nI interviewed the foster care worker and she confirmed that she\ninformed the adoption worker of the foster parents’ decision to\nhave Youth A removed from their home. She said at no time were\nthere any threats made towards the foster parents by her or the\nadoption worker. She said there were concern about the foster\nparents’ behavior towards Youth A and the incidents with the other\nchildren that was not reported to her or the agency from the foster\nparents. She said a decision was made to open a special\ninvestigation on the home due to several incidents that had\noccurred in the home regarding the children placed in her home\nand their well-being. Foster Care Worker reported for the well -\nbeing of all children, a decision was made by her upper\nadministration to remove all children from the home until the\ninvestigations were completed. She said the foster parent did not\nreport injuries that occurred with Youth A when they occurred.\nThe foster care worker said when asked about Youth A’s injuries,\nthe foster parent reported she did not think it was an emergency\nthat needed to be reported. She provided an example of the\nFoster Parent not reporting incidents such as the foster parent\nwas with a repair man for about 15 minutes, Youth A had gotten\noutside and was eating dog feces or throw up. The FCW said\nwhen she expressed this with Youth A’s Physician, she said this\ninformation should have been reported immediately to her\nattention to determine if the child ingested parasites. The Foster\nCare Worker said the foster parent did not report this incident and\nwhen the foster care worker asked the foster parent about it, she\nsaid the foster parent stated she expected Youth A to set an\nexample for the younger kids in the home. Youth A is 4 years old.\n7",
    "Documents Reviewed:\n• DHHS investigation report date 3/28/2023, reported safety\nplans were established for the family for Youth B and Youth\nC on 3/14/2023 and 3/30/2023. The family will be required\nto inform workers of any incidents within a timely manner\nincluding injuries, behaviors, etc. They will be required to\nunderstand and follow all licensing rules, and complete any\nadditional training as required by foster care/licensing.\nWith regards to Youth A, no safety plan was needed as he\nwas removed from the home per the foster parents’ request\nprior to the investigation. The outcome of the case was\ndiscussed with all parties and there were no findings of\nabuse/neglect.\n• Agency special investigation report dated 4/24/23, reported\nthe foster parents were found in non-compliance with rule\n414-4-b. The foster parents did not take Youth A to a\ndoctor when his penis was bleeding. The foster parents\nprovided inconsistent stories. One story reported Youth A\nhad pinch mark on his penis and was dripping blood and\nthe other story reported that the foster parents could not\nfind where the bleeding was coming from and that it clotted\nquickly with no visible marks. The foster parents were\nplaced on a first provisional license with a corrective action\nplan.\n• Well Child Examination report for Youth A dated 3/23/2023,\nreported all of Youth A’s medical needs and diagnosis.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with this rule. Documentation\nwas provided to the foster parents regarding the reasons for the\nremoval. Interviews supported that the removal was warranted.\nNotification was provided to the foster parents as to why the\nchildren was being removed. The agency also provided\nnumerous resources and support to the family to assist with the\nbehaviors of Youth A prior to his removal which the foster parent\nrequested a 30-day removal. It was also observed the agency\npolicy and procedures signed and dated by the foster parents.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n8",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended Ennis Center for Children - Pontiac\ncurrent license status be continued.\n____________________________________ 6/21/2023\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6/23/22\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n9"
