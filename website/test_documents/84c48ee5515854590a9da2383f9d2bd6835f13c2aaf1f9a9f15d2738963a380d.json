Supervisor A is a\nstaff member that works at Christ Child House. On 5/18/23\nbetween the hours of 7-8am Supervisor A told two residents to\ntake Youth A out back before school and beat him up. It is\nunknown if any kind of fight occurred or if the conversation\nbetween Supervisor A and the residents actually took place.\nYouth A does not have any noticeable injuries, marks, or\nbruises.\nThe referral source is the Clinical Director at Christ Child House. I\nspoke with the referral source on 5/23/23 via the phone. She\nreported she was in group with the residents on 5/18/2023 and\nthey were discussing consequences and incentives related to the\nyouth fighting a lot lately. The residents were given examples of\nscenarios when fights happen, and the boys were coming up with\nconsequences. Youth B asked what if a supervisor tells you to go\nhit another kid. Youth B was snickering when he asked this\nquestion. Youth B reported that Supervisor A told a group of the\nresidents to beat up Youth A.

Youth Worker 2 reported\nSupervisor A asserts her authority with youth and staff more than\nnecessary and that Supervisor A has a different approach that is\nmore negative and escalates situations.
