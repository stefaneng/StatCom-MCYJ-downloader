The complaint noted the following:\nYouth A (15) is a court ward who resides at Vassar House. Youth\nWorker 1 and Youth Supervisor 1 are staff members at the facility.\nYouth A has a safety plan in place and is supposed to be supervised\ndue to self-harming behaviors. This morning Youth Worker 1 and Youth\nSupervisor 1 were supervising Youth A and were trying to maintain a\nline of sight on Youth A. Youth A walked out of the cafe and Youth\nWorker 1 and Youth Supervisor 1 followed Youth A and attempted to\nwalk her back to her unit. Youth A sat down and refused to go back to\nher unit. Youth Worker 1 and Youth Supervisor 1 inappropriately\ngrabbed Youth A by the collar of her shirt or shoulders and\ninappropriately moved her from the unit doorway and brought her back\ninto the unit. Youth A does not have any visible marks or injuries.\n4",
    "There are no videos of the incident. Youth Worker 1 and Youth\nSupervisor 1 have both been sent home for the day.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 12/21/2022, jointly with the\nDHHS Specialist. Youth A has lived at Vassar House for the past six\nmonths. Youth A lives on unit 3 and after breakfast she refused to\nreturn to her unit. Youth A said she sat down on the ground, crossed\nlegged, not far from her unit. Youth A reported Youth Worker 1 and\nYouth Supervisor 1 were both present. Youth A said Youth Supervisor\n1 dragged her by her shirt collar into the unit. Youth A indicated Youth\nSupervisor 1 was on the side of her and dragged her by the side of her\ncollar. Youth A reported she was dragged a short distance just inside\nthe doorway. Youth A reported she was dragged a few seconds and\nwas not hurt. She denied any marks or injuries on her body from the\nincident. Youth A denied Youth Worker 1 touched her. Once inside the\ndoorway of her unit Youth A continued to sit cross legged on the floor\nby the front door. Youth B and Youth C were posted by the front and\nback doors to deter Youth A from leaving the building. Posting was\ndescribed by Youth A as when a youth sits in front of the door to keep\nanother youth from leaving the building. The youth posted are\nreportedly not allowed to touch the youth attempting to leave and are\nonly a physical deterrent. Youth A denied that she is afraid of any staff.\nYouth A reported no one was outside when this occurred.\nI interviewed Youth Worker 1 at the facility on 12/21/2022, jointly with\nthe DHHS Specialist. Youth Worker 1 has worked as a youth care\nworker for eight and a half years. She works first shift from 7am until\n3pm and on Monday's she works 6am until 2pm. Youth Worker 1\nreported on the day of the incident she worked from 6am until 2pm.\nShe woke the children up and Youth A had requested a sweatshirt and\nsocks which were provided to her. Youth Worker 1 reported Youth A\nwas doing well that morning and lined up for breakfast without any\nissues. Youth Worker 1 said when they went to breakfast Youth A's old\nunit (unit 1) was also eating breakfast and this upset Youth A as she\nwanted to go back to living on unit 1. Youth A walked out of the cafe\nand Youth Worker 1 walked out behind her and asked her what was\ngoing on with her. Youth A said she wanted to go back to unit 1. Youth\nWorker 1 took Youth A back to the café. When they attempt to go back\nto her unit, Youth A sat down cross legged on the ground outside.\nYouth A sat on the ground for approximately 20 minutes refusing to go\nback into her unit. Youth Worker 1 said she talked with Youth A trying\nto get her to go inside. Youth Worker 1 reported Youth Supervisor 1\nwas standing behind Youth A and grabbed Youth A under her arms and\nslid/pulled Youth A into unit 3. Youth A was left sitting inside the\ndoorway of the unit and two youth were posted at each exit. Youth\n4",
    "Worker 1 reported the youth were posted at the doors for approximately\nfive minutes and then all the youth went to school including Youth A.\nYouth Worker 1 said “I was shocked when she did it” regarding how\nYouth Supervisor 1 pulled Youth A into the unit. Youth Worker 1 denied\nthat she has ever seen Youth Supervisor 1 put her hands on a youth\npreviously. Youth Worker 1 said she felt it was “sort of aggressive as it\nhappened so fast”. Youth Worker 1 did not tell anyone about what\nhappened and left to go take kids to wrap presents.\nYouth Worker 1 indicated posting is used when there is not enough\nstaff to post by the doors. The youth post in front of the exit doors by\nstanding or sitting on a chair in front of the door. The youth are not\nallowed to touch anyone trying to leave threw the door. Youth Worker 1\nindicated Supervisors decide if they are going to post and who is going\nto post at the doors.\nCase Manager 1 was phone interviewed on 1/3/2023. She has been an\nemployee with Vassar House for 22 years in many capacities. She is\ncurrently a case manager at Camp 1. Case Manager 1 reported that\nshe was working on unit 3 and Youth A refused to go back to her unit\nafter breakfast. Case Manager 1 took the rest of the girls back to the\nunit and Youth Worker 1 and Youth Supervisor 1 were with Youth A\nwho was sitting crossed legged on the ground outside refusing to go\ninto unit 3. Case Manager 1 observed the door to the unit open and\nclose as the staff were trying to escort Youth A into unit 3. The door\nopened again and while Youth Worker 1 and Youth Supervisor 1 were\nescorting Youth A she sat down. Case Manager 1 reported Youth\nWorker 1 and Youth Supervisor 1 pulled Youth A by the collar of her\nsweatshirt and her shoulders into the building. Case Manger 1 reported\nYouth A did not say anything and did not indicate she had been harmed\nor injured. Case Manager 1 reported they pulled Youth A about 4-5\nfeet. After Youth A was inside the unit, youth were posted at the front\nand back door to deter Youth A from leaving the unit. Case Manager 1\nreported posting is when a youth or adult sits at the exit doors. The\nperson posting should not touch the youth and they are just a visual\nblock. Posting is used when they have concern of truancy. Case\nManager 1 said they sometimes use staff to post if enough staff are\nworking. Case Manager 1 reported that posting is utilized at all units at\nVassar House but is not used at another of the organization’s facilities.\nCase Manager 1 indicated she left the unit shortly after the incident and\nreported the incident to a higher up staff member who reported it to\nCentralized Intake.\nI interviewed Youth Supervisor 1 via phone on 1/5/2023 with the DHHS\nSpecialist. DHHS Specialist was with Youth Supervisor 1 onsite, and\n4",
    "this writer was present by Teams. Youth Supervisor 1 has been\nemployed at Vassar House for four years. She reported she worked a\nthird shift the night of the incident. She was in the cafe passing\nmedication and Youth A kept walking in and out of the café. Youth A\nwas upset because her old unit was also in the cafe eating breakfast\nand getting medication. Youth A verbalized she wanted to return to her\nold unit. When Youth A left the cafe Youth Worker 1 followed her\noutside. Youth Supervisor 1 indicated Case Manager 1 called her to let\nher know Youth A was outside with Youth Worker 1. Youth Supervisor\n1 could not immediately assist as she was passing medication.

Youth A then sat down on the ground\nand was scooting backward trying to get to unit 1. Youth Supervisor 1\nsaid she went outside and was trying to talk with Youth A to get her to\ngo to her unit. Youth A then picked up something off the ground and\ntook off running. Youth Supervisor 1 did not know what she picked up\noff the ground. Youth Supervisor 1 felt Youth A's behavior was a risk as\nshe had just come off a safety plan. Supervisor 1 indicated she hooked\nher arm in Youth A's left arm and Youth Worker 1 hooked her arm in\nYouth A's right arm and they began to escort Youth A to unit 3. Youth A\nwas reportedly walking and then when the door opened to go inside,\nshe tried to sit down. Youth Supervisor 1 said she told her she had to\ngo in. Youth Supervisor 1's arm was reportedly still linked with Youth\nA's, and she grabbed Youth A's sweatshirt in the bicep area and pulled\nto assist with moving her inside the doorway.

Youth A\nwas scratching her wrist with the rock, and she tried to swallow the\nrock. Youth B reported Youth A has a history of having items that she\nself-harms with. When youth have items, they should not have, and are\nkeeping them concealed the youth are asked to \"pop\".

    "Youth Worker 2 was interviewed via phone with the DHHS Specialist on\n1/24/23. Youth Worker 2 has been employed with Vassar House since\nOctober 2023 as a Youth Worker. Youth Worker 2 reported she is\nfamiliar with Youth A and that Youth A acts out a lot and tells people\ndaily she is going to beat them up or that she going to beat some ass.\nYouth A is reportedly a difficult youth at Vassar House, and she often is\non a one-to-one supervision and has a safety plan. Youth A also\nfrequently leaves the building multiple times a day. Youth Worker 2\nindicated Youth A has told her she is going to beat her up and then\napologizes typically the next day. Youth Worker 2 said she knows this\nabout Youth A and this appears to be her pattern of behavior. Youth\nWorker 2 reported she has never said she was tired of Youth A’s\nbullshit. Youth Worker 2 reported she has never said she gave a can of\nwhoop ass to Youth A. Youth Worker 2 said staff do not like to be one\non one with Youth A as she is very difficult to supervise. Youth Worker\n2 is familiar with the term pop. She has never had a youth do this but\nheard it is done when youth come back from visitation. Youth Worker 2\nshared they have to post as part of their jobs. She described posting as\none person at the front door and one at the back door to maintain line\nof sight on the youth.\nThroughout this investigation youth reported incidents of self-harming\nevents by Youth A and a lack of one-to-one supervision when\nnecessary for Youth A and other youth. There were allegations of youth\nbeing told to break up a fight and aggressive behavior by staff with\nyouth. These allegations had been investigated previously or were\ncurrently under investigation in Special Investigations 2023C000046,\n2023C0000177, 2023C0000046, 2023C0229003, and therefore were\nnot investigated as part of this report.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation includes the\nfollowing, with applicable information outlined:\nOriginal incident report witness statement authored by Youth Worker 1,\ndated 12/19/2022. The report noted the following 'Youth A refused to go\nback to her unit after breakfast and walked off from her group and went\noutside. Staff walked behind her talking with her to come to the group.\nYouth A was taken back to the cafeteria and SST was informed she\nwas refusing to return to her unit. Youth A then walked with group\ntowards her unit and when she got close to the unit she sat down on\nthe ground and said she was not going back to her unit. Staff stood\noutside with Youth A for about 20 minutes. I guess the youth care\nworker supervisor was frustrated at the time. She then pulled the client\ninto the unit and told two peers to post at the door’. X\n4",
    "Original incident report witness statement authored by Youth\nSupervisor 1, dated 12/19/2022. The report noted the following: 'While\nin the cafe passing meds Youth A was playing around and laughing at\nthe table. Prior to that she was having issues in the unit because she\ndidn't want to be in the unit she was moved to. Youth A left the building\nand walked around for a while and then returned and I closed the cart\nand talked to her. Youth A was getting escalated, and I talked to her\nabout why she couldn't move. I talked with her and got her to walk\nback where the units were, and she turned as if she was going to unit 1.\nI provided proximity between Youth A and going towards unit 1 by\nstanding in front of her trying to talk with her to go back to unit 3. I\nplaced my arm inside her arm and said, we can walk to the unit\ntogether like this, so it doesn't look like you refused to go back. I could\nprobably help you not get much paperwork. Youth A said really and\nthen sat on the ground for about 20 minutes and then got up to run\naway from units which I felt was unsafe due to her history and just\ncoming off a safety plan. I placed my arm inside her arm along with\nYW1 and I opened the unit door as we were escorting her back to the\nunit with the door open as we got halfway back in the door she began\nto refuse to go back, and she sat on the floor, and I asked two clients to\npost at the doors. Youth A sat on the floor in the hallway’.\nOriginal incident report witness statement authored by Case Worker 1,\ndated 12/19/22. The report noted the following, ‘after breakfast Youth A\nrefused to go back to the unit and went outside. Youth Worker 1 went\nwith Youth A, and I took the rest of the group to the unit. After a while\nthe door opened, and Youth Supervisor 1 and Youth Worker 1 were\ntrying to escort Youth A into the unit. Youth A turned and walked back\noutside. At about 7:15am the door opened; Youth A was sitting down.\nYouth Worker 1 and Youth Supervisor 1 got her by collar/shoulders and\ndragged her into the unit while she was still sitting. Then I was told I\ncould leave my shift, so I did’.\nNurses Note dated 12/19/22. Youth A was seen by the staff nurse on\n12/19/22. Youth states on report that she was pushed into her unit\nyesterday evening and today. She then stated she couldn't remember.\nAfter thinking about it for a minute, Youth A stated that last night staff\npushed her on both shoulders into the unit and this morning she was\nsitting on the floor/ground so staff couldn't get a hold of her, and that\nstaff pushed her then grabbed the collar of her sweatshirt and pulled\nher. Youth A denied any pain or discomfort. Nurse observed where\nclient stated staff touched her. There was no bruising, redness or open\nareas present.\nMedical documentation from Covenant MedExpress Frankenmuth.\nYouth A was seen by Dr. Ayush Shrestha, MD on 12/19/22 for injury\n4",
    "due to altercation. She was released with no restrictions and no noted\nareas of injury on the release papers.\nYouth A safety plans: Youth A had a client safety plan from December\n20, 2022-January 1, 2023, and one from January 1, 2023-January 30,\n2023. The client safety plan outlined what makes Youth A feel unsafe,\nwhat unsafe behavior looks like for her and how to keep herself safe.\nYouth A also had a staff safety plan from November 1, 2022-November\n23, 2022, and December 20, 2022, until January 30, 2023. The staff\nsafety plan outlined Youth A’s safety concerns -suicidal ideation,\nmaking threats, self-care, isolating and ignoring redirection. Safety\nbased restrictions for Youth A included staff stay within 6 feet of Youth\nA, only one SST will give Youth A her personal hygiene items, no client\nwill give Youth A anything, staff in bathroom speak to Youth A and to\nhave a safety blanket, but no clothes in shower.\nBSM1 Policy & Procedure for TCI in Residential Program the TCI\ninterventions are non-violent and are used in such a manner as to not\nbe hostile or injurious.

Youth Supervisor 1 admitted to\nusing force to move Youth A into the building after she had dropped\nweight and was sitting on the ground. Youth A reported she was pulled\ninto the building and several youth and staff indicated Youth Supervisor\n1 pulled Youth A into the building.
