    "Chief Administrator Assessment:\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) discussed the barriers the agency has experienced\nover the past year which included continued staffing changes. She reported it took\na considerable time to hire staff, train them, and determine systems that work well\nfor the team to ensure efficient and quality work. CA reported that it continues to\nwork on determining those systems and being able to maintain consistency of the\nsystems through staff changes. She said there are continued systemic factors in\nregard to data management to address ISEP. CA reported there has been an\nincrease on the focus, creating multiple meetings and many email communications\nto discuss the KPI data, which focuses the attention away from the work, although\nshe believes some of the information has been useful in getting closer to meeting\nthe standards. CA reported she believe human error needs to be considered as a\nfactor. CA said while the agency utilizes checks and balances to help minimize\nerrors, it is inevitable that human error will play a factor in not meeting every\nstandard. However, the agency will do the best they can with the resources they\nhave.\nFinancial Overview:\nThe agency submitted their agency budget and independent audit dated\n12//31/2023. No concerns were noted.\nStaff and Youth Interviews:\nThe staff were very supportive of the agency, their coworkers, supervisors and the\ntraining they receive. They would not change anything at this time.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through:\nThe agency has the space and equipment needed to perform job requirements.\nThe files are stored securely to prevent unauthorized access\n5",
