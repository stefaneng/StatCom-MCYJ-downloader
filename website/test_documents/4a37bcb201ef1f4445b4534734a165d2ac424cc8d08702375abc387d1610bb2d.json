The agency made\nprogress with this Renewal Inspection corrective action plan but were not totally\nsuccessful with all as indicated by the repeat violations indicated in this inspection\nreport.\nThe second corrective action plan related to Special investigation 2022C0201017;\nwhich was initiated 5/23/2022. The allegation was that the agency had not submitted\nfive closed adoption records for permanent retention one year following the final\norder of adoption. The agency received a citation for R400.12713(5) for Adoption\nplacement. The agency reported the five records in question were submitted to the\ndepartment on 5/27/2022. Receipt acknowledgement forms showing the records’\nsubmissions were provided during the investigation; and I reviewed those receipts\ndated 5/27/2022. The agency’s corrective action plan indicated going forward it\nwould distribute closed adoption records to the department quarterly. Additionally,\nthat the director and the agency’s executive administrative assistance would have a\ntickler reminder one month prior to when the records are to be mail/sent out. The\nCAP was to be completed by 8/1/2022. I reviewed a copy of the agency’s closed\nadoption record procedure; and various receipt acknowledgement forms submitted\nto various county offices showing timely submission. This CAP has been completed.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency completed an annual Chief Administrator's report as required by the\nrule. No obvious concerns were noted.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted an annual budget and financial report, no obvious concerns\nwere noted.\n8",
    "Staff Interviews\nFoster care and adoption staff (two foster care workers, one licensing worker, one\nadoption worker, also with the indicated administrative staff) were interviewed during\nthis Interim inspection. No concerns were indicated. The agency does not offer\nindependent living services whereby any youths would be interviewed.\nIt is noteworthy the agency has experienced additional growth and has added\nanother foster care team. It has also expanded its foster care services to include\nonsite therapeutic services to the children and families it serves. The agency has\ncompleted a therapeutic brochure and referral process. It has a full-time therapist,\nand it has recently started to accept internal referrals.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency did not reveal any areas of concern.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were three safety alerts this inspection:\nSafety Alert # 1, received 9/14/2022\nConcern:\nThe home does not have a working smoke detector in the bedroom or hallway where\nthe children sleep. The caregiver indicated the smoke detector was removed and\nwould be replaced by the City of Warren. The Department of Child Welfare\nLicensing (DCWL) Analyst requested verification the latter was completed.\nResolution:\nThe agency contacted the relative caregiver on 9/15/2022 to verify that the working\nsmoke detector was installed and working. The family recorded the smoke alarm\nworking and submitted it to the agency licensing specialist on 9/15/2022. The\nagency provided a photo of the installed detectors.\nSafety Alert # 2, received 10/31/2022:\nConcern:\nThere were no working smoke detectors in the home. The relative caregiver was\nmade aware of the concern and indicated they will get batteries. The DCWL Analyst\nrequested verification the smoke detectors are working.\nResolution:\nThe agency’s foster care worker made a home visit to the relative’s house on\n11/1/2022 and verified that the smoke detectors were all in working order. The\nagency provided photos showing the home’s upstairs and downstairs smoke\ndetector.\nConcern:\nThere was large amounts of dog feces observed in the relative’s bedroom and\nbasement.\n9",
    "Resolution:\nThe agency reported that during the foster care worker’s home visit on 11/1/2022 the\nworker went downstairs and verified that the dog feces was cleaned up. No odor of\ndog urine or fecal matter was reported in the home. The relative caregiver and foster\ncare worker created a safety plan related to how the relative would check for and\ncomplete regular dog defecation clean up in the basement and anywhere in the\nhome. The agency provided a photo showing the basement was clean. The worker\nnoted that the relative caregiver's home had flooded this year which caused the\nfloor’s discolored and peeling appearance.\nSafety Alert # 3, received 10/21/2022\nConcern:\nThe smoke detector on the first and second floor was beeping and the DCWL\nAnalyst advised the caregiver of the need for a battery. Verification that the batteries\nwere installed was requested by the DCWL Analyst.\nResolution:\nThe assigned foster care worker completed a relative home visit on 11/2/2022. The\nagency advised the delay in gaining access to the home was due to the relative\nbeing hospitalized. During the stated home visit the relative confirmed that all\ndetector batteries were replaced and tested the detectors verifying such.\nConcern:\nThe DCWL Analyst was not given access to the home’s basement and requested\npictures of the space; and verification that a smoke detector and carbon monoxide\ndetector exists in the basement.\nResolution:\nDuring the agency home visit on 11/2/2022 the agency provided the relative with a\ncombination smoke/carbon monoxide detector. The relative installed the detector in\nthe basement and the agency provided a photo showing that installed device. The\nagency provided photos of the home’s basement, which showed some items lying\nabout and areas requiring cleaning and additional upkeep. The agency followed up\nand addressed those issues with the relative. The agency reported, no one is\nsleeping in the basement, and they developed a safety plan with the relative as of\n2/3/2023 that indicates the relative caregiver agrees to not allow the children access\nto the basement, and to not store the children’s belonging in the basement. A copy of\nthe safety plan for the basement was provided by the agency.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n10",
