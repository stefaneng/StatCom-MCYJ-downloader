Another arrest for the same date was documented in\nFlint, Michigan which did not show a charge or judgement. The\nrecord did not contain a written evaluation of the conviction by\nthe chief administrator or his designee, nor a written statement\nfrom the employee about the conviction.\nRepeat Violation, Renewal 2018.\nR 400.12212 Personnel records.\n(3) The personnel record shall contain both of the following:\n(b) A copy of the job description for the staff member's\ncurrent position.\nTwo of 13 employee records reviewed showed the respective\nemployee was promoted to a new position in 2019. The record\ndid not show documentation of the employee’s current position.\nRepeat Violation- Renewal 2016.\nR 400.12505 Supervision.\n(2) An agency shall provide the following minimum supervision:\n4",
    "(b) At monthly intervals, ensure that the youth is complying\nwith the terms of the contract required by R 400.125010,\ncontinues to reside in a safe and acceptable environment, and\nis managing expenditures.\nThe facility’s partially finished basement is used by the youths\nfor recreation. I observed wires hanging from the ceiling in\nseveral spots. There were also several floor tiles being held\ntogether with duct tape which was coming loose, creating a\nsafety issue.\nR 400.12509 Independent living record.\n(3) The case record shall contain all of the following information\nand documentation, which shall be recorded within 30 calendar\ndays after placement in independent living and updated at least\nonce every 90 calendar days:\n(o) Service plans as required in R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420. If the youth has biological children, the service plan\nmust address the living arrangement for the child or children,\nvisitation/parenting time with the youth's biological children or a\nclear explanation why this is not possible or appropriate.\nTwo of three open youth records reviewed did not show\ncompliance to the rule. The service plan either did not contain\ntime frames for all goals or who would implement the action\nsteps or the role of the case manager.\nRepeat Violation- Interim 2017, Renewal 2016.\nR 400.12510 Independent living contract.\n(2) The agreement shall be signed and dated by the youth and\nthe social service worker. The contract shall be reviewed and\nupdated at least once every 90 calendar days and a copy\nprovided to the youth.\nOne of three open youth records reviewed did not show\ndocumentation of an updated agreement for the youth, due\nOctober 17, 2019.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there\nare additional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility\nis in compliance will all additional ISEP requirements except for the following:\n5",
    "None\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nNot applicable.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR400.12202 Policy and procedures(g):\nThe agency requires all staff to complete 16 hours of orientation and 16 hours of\ntraining annually. The agency was apprised the employee’s annual hours must be\nclearly and accurately documented for the employee’s annual reporting period.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nR400.12212 Personnel records (e) & (h).\nThe agency was advised obtaining an updated ICHAT and children service\nclearance for a senior employee prior to promotion could be beneficial in terms of\nbest practice standards.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The corrective action plan related to the\nfacility’s 2018 Renewal Inspection, where it received two rule violations. The agency\nwas not successful with that corrective action plan, as it received repeat citations\nrelated to those rules this inspection.\nThe agency has a new chief administrator and program coordinator. It continues to\nmaintain steady placements. The $200,000 Health and Services grant received last\nyear enabled the agency to open two, two-bedroom rental properties for a Homeless\nPrevention Program. This program is to aid youths’ pursuit for independent living\nand longer-term permanent housing. At the time of this inspection both rental\nproperties are vacant.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n6",
    "Based on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\nDecember 22, 2019\n_______________________________________\nLonia Perry Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 26, 2019\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
