    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\nR 400.113 Employee records\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each employee and\nshall include documentation of all of the following information prior to\nemployment or at the time specified in this rule:\n(i) Documentation from MDHHS, the equivalent state or Canadian\nprovincial agency, or equivalent agency in the country where\nthe person usually resides, that the person has not been\ndetermined to be a perpetrator of child abuse or child neglect.\nthe documentation shall be completed not more than 30 days\nprior to the start of employment and every 12 months thereafter\nThree of eight employees did not have a Central Registry\nclearance either annually or prior to hire.\nR 400.113 Employee records\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each employee and\nshall include documentation of all of the following information prior to\nemployment or at the time specified in this rule:\n(j) A written evaluation of the employee’s performance within\n30 days of the completion of the probationary period or within\n180 days, whichever is less, and a written evaluation of the\nemployee’s performance annually thereafter.\nOne of two new employees did not have a performance\nevaluation within 30 days of the probationary period.\nR 400.4120 Supervisor of direct care workers; qualifications.\nA supervisor of direct care workers shall have 1 of the following:\n(a) A bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university\nand 2 years of work experience in a child caring institution.\n4",
    "The supervisor of direct care workers (hired on 7/3/19) does not\nmeet the qualification requirements for the position. When hired,\nshe had a bachelor’s degree but no work experience in a child\ncaring institution. The agency did not seek DCWL consultation\nprior to hiring her. In this instance I suggested the agency request\na variance.\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(3) The licensee shall document that each staff person whose function\nis covered by these rules has participated in a minimum of 50 clock\nhours of planned training within the first year of employment and a\nminimum of 25 clock hours of training annually thereafter related to\nthe employee’s job function. At least 16 of the 50 hours provided in the\nfirst year shall be orientation provided prior to the assumption of duties.\nTwo of six staff did not have 25 hours of training annually\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan.\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional care,\nall of the following information shall be documented in the\ncase record within 14 days after discharge:\n(a) The date of and reason for discharge, and the new\nlocation of the child.\n(b) A brief summary or other documentation of the\nservices provided by the facility after discharge.\n(c) An assessment of the residents needs that remain to\nbe met.\n(d) Any services that will be provided by the facility after\nDischarge.\n(e) A statement that the discharge plan recommendations\nincluding medical and dental follow up that is needed,\nhave been reviewed with the resident, parent and\nresponsible case manager.\n(f) The name and official title of the person to whom the\nresident was discharged.\n5",
    "One of three youth who had been discharged did not have a discharge plan.\n2.) This is a non-MDHHS contracted facility and therefore not required to follow ISEP\nrequirements.\n3.) This is a non-MDHHS contracted facility and therefore not required to follow MDHHS\npolicies.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTo fully comply with R. 400.4166 Discharge plan, it was recommended the facility\ndevelop a discharge instruction form to be completed at the time of discharge. I\nprovided them with a sample form that can be altered and used a template.\nDischarge plans/instructions must be completed on all youth including those youth\nwith short term (respite) stays.\nTo comply with R 400.4153 Shelter care and detention institutions; preliminary\nservice plans, preliminary service plans must be developed for short-term (respite)\nyouth within 7 calendar days of admission. A preliminary service plan template will\nneed to be developed and utilized.\nThe agency must follow the same pre-hire and training requirements for any\nemployee who works at Genesis House, including those staff borrowed or transferred\nfrom other Spectrum programs.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency is seeking to change the chief administrator/licensee designee from\nKimberly O’Neal to the program’s current associate director. The associate director has\na wealth of experience and is the most likely candidate. However, she does not meet\nthe minimum educational requirements of the rule. I recommended the agency request\na variance.\nI provided a sample variance request with instructions on how to request a variance.\nThe new CAP form was provided to the agency. When they are ready, I will provide\nconsultation on how to complete the form.\n6",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nI completed an unannounced walk-through of the facility on 9/4/20 and\ninterviewed staff and youth who were present. There were no issues. The\nhome was clean and nicely decorated. I checked kitchen cupboards,\nbathrooms, bedrooms and refrigerator and freezer temperatures. I was unable\nto complete a walk-through in Dec 2020 due to a recent report of a COVID+\nstaff.\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no DCWL investigations. Thus, the facility submitted no corrective\naction plans during this licensing period.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nDecember 23, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 28, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
