The agency\nwas cited with four violations. The agency is in non-compliance with two of those\nviolations during this reporting period. More focus is needed to bring these two\nviolations into compliance.\nSpecial investigation #2024SIC0001302, initiated 4/2/2024 was found in non-\ncompliance with Rules 400.12207 Staff responsibilities, 400.12314 Religion and\nspirituality policy and 400.12418 (1) Development of service plans.

She reported there are large amount of policy items required for a foster\ncare case. She reported workers reported finding it difficult to prioritize paperwork\ncompletion during times that they have a crisis on their caseload, as the crisis\ntakes precedent. She said there are also times when cases are more complex,\nhave more frequent court hearings or requirements, which all take precedent over\nthe documentation portion of a foster care case. The CA reported as an agency\nthey had previously set aside protected time to address concerns related to social\nwork contact documentation. CA reported recently, time has been extended, from\ntwo hours to six hours, in order to include time to work on documentation of the\ncase throughout MiSACWIS, in addition to social work contacts being added.\nFinancial Overview:\nThe agency submitted their agency budget and independent audit dated\n9/30/2023.
