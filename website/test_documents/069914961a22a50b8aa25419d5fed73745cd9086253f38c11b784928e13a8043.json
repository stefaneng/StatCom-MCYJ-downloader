    "summary": "An anonymous complaint alleged an unsafe environment at the Clarence Fischer Center, citing youth-on-youth assaults, potential weapon use, and a serious incident where multiple youths left their units unsupervised overnight. A thorough investigation involving interviews, document reviews, and video footage concluded that staff consistently intervened in fights, followed established protocols, and made reasonable efforts to supervise youths, leading to no substantiated violations. The report explicitly states 'No substantial violations were found' and places the facility in compliance with all rules, effectively clearing the facility and its staff of culpability for the alleged incidents.",
