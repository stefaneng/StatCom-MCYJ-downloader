Description of Findings and Conclusions\nPhysical Description of Facility\nMcCullough Home is an additional building located on the St. John’s Home\nResidential Campus off of Knapp Street in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Upon entering\nthe main door there is a mudroom/ waiting area to the second door to lead you into\nthe main home. Once you enter the main door, there is a large milieu area where\nthere are tables for the youth to use for mealtimes and activities. The milieu also\nincludes two couches and a TV that is mounted to the wall. This area has multiple\nwindows that allows natural light into the open area. There is a bookshelf with age\nappropriate and developmental level books and activities. Off of the milieu there is\nan open kitchen area where meals will be prepared for the home. The kitchen area\nhas a working refrigerator, dishwasher, sink, microwave, and stove. There is a\nfood pantry with dry goods. The kitchen area has safety locks on the cabinets\nnoted for spices, pots, pans, and breakable objects. There is a home phone\nlocated within the kitchen area that gives access for youth to make approved\nphone calls. To the right of the kitchen there is locked room that has the locked\nmedication cart and the washer and dryer. This allows the medications to be\ndoubled locked. Across the hall from the laundry room is the locked staff\nbathroom/staff office. This room will be used for staff to put their personal items,\nlock up items that youth cannot have access to, such as sharp knives.\nWithin the main level of the home, there are two hallways designated for sleeping\nareas for the youth. To the left of the milieu there is one hallway that has three\nsingle bedrooms, three single bathrooms, and three rooms designated to be each\n2",
    "youth’s own sensory rooms. To the right of the milieu there this another hallway\nthat has three single bedrooms, three single bathrooms, and three rooms\ndesignated to be each youth’s own sensory rooms. Each bedroom has a twin size\nbed, desk and closet for the youth. Each youth will have their own bathroom that\nhas their own toilet and bath/shower. There is one bathroom that is equipped for\nhandicap needs. The sensory rooms are designated for each youth to use for their\npersonal needs. Each hallway has an emergency exit door.\nOff of the milieu there is access to the basement area of the home. This access is\nhas a gate blocking access to the basement stairs. Once you walk down the stairs\nthere is a locked door. When you enter the basement to the right there is locked\noffice areas where youth personal files will be kept and staff offices such as the\nprogram supervisor’s office. To the right of the basement stairs there is an open\nmilieu area that the youth will have extra space to perform activities. There is a\nbathroom downstairs that youth will have access to when utilizing this area. The\nbasement area has large window areas to bring in natural light and there are two\nexit doors. Outside the home there is a mini basketball court for youth to have\naccess to.\nProgram Description\nMcCullough House is a 6-bed open, community- based facility providing\ncomprehensive services to youth in a home-like setting. The program will support\nyouth between the ages of 11-17 with developmental disabilities, defined as an\nindividual diagnosed with a mental disorder which significantly impacts their\nadaptive functioning and ability to care for themselves and generally is considered\na lifelong consideration. Youth admitted to this program must demonstrate, within\nthe last six months, a responsiveness to redirection around de-escalation. IQ\ntesting results must indicate an IQ score of 45-69 to be eligible for this program.\nYouth with additional complex medical needs would be assessed to determine if\nthe program could safely support the referred youth. Youth in this program will be\ninvolved with MDHHS or Adoption Subsidy.\nUpon admission, an initial assessment will occur within 30-days to determine\ntreatment needs and types of intervention most beneficial for the youth. The facility\nwill utilize a multidisciplinary approach throughout treatment which includes\nmedical, psychiatric, therapeutic, and case management services in addition to\n24/7 supervision and care. Youth will be provided weekly individual therapy,\nspecialized group therapy or intensive activity-based therapy. Adjunct therapy will\ninclude Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy and Applied\nBehavioral Analysis is provided and/or coordinated as the treatment plan\nindicates. Discharge planning begins on the day of admission with a goal of\ndischarge within a nine-month time frame and to a less restrictive setting than an\nopen, non-secure, residential treatment program. Discharge and after care\nservices are developed and organized in collaboration with the youth’s MDHHS or\nprivate agency worker and treatment team.\n3",
    "Psychiatric services are contracted through Pine Rest Christian Mental Health\nServices and or/ Hope Network. A Board-Certified Child Psychiatrist provides care\nto the youth placed at the facility. Health Services are overseen by a Registered\nNurse with support from licensed medical providers, on site, in addition to medical\ncare coordinated through Spectrum Health Adolescent Clinic, located in Grand\nRapids, MI. Educational Services are provided through the Kent Intermediate\nSchool District and/or Grand Rapids Public schools and are coordinated and\noverseen by St. John’s residential case managers.\nThe staff-to-resident ratio is 1:2 during waking hours and 1:4 during sleeping\nhours. The facility will have no form of seclusions for the residents. Facility staff\nwill be trained in the use of AEGIS system training for de-escalation and\nemergency restraint purposes. The AEGIS System focuses on prevention of\ndysregulation in youth and provides for the least restrictive therapeutic holds when\nthere is an emergency restraint needed.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend that the McCullough Home be added to the St. John’s Home\nResidential License and the license to have an increased capacity to 46.\nAugust 22, 2022\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 25, 2022\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
