Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nOn 6/02/21, staff were attempting to verbally de-escalate a youth. Another staff\nmember came to the side of the youth which escalated youth who began hitting staff\nmember. Staff member reached out with open hand and arm extended towards\nyouth but did not appear to make contact. Other staff stepped in to create a barrier.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 6/2/2021 at 9:00AM I made an unannounced visit to the facility during which I\nmade a face-to-face observation of Youth A, a non-verbal child, who did not appear\nto have any visible injuries. I also made face-to-face contact with Staff 1.\nINTERVIEWS\nClinician - On 6/4/2021 I interviewed Clinician by phone. He reported that he and\nShift Supervisor were on the unit with Youth A who was escalated, utilizing verbal\nde-escalation techniques and a tablet to communicate. All of the other youth were\neither in their bedrooms or in the cafeteria and there were no other staff on the unit\nat the time until Staff 1 came out of the cafeteria and stood in the hallway between\nthe cafeteria and the milieu area where Clinician and Shift Supervisor were working\nwith Youth A. Youth A went over to Staff 1 and started hitting and slapping her.\nClinician saw Staff 1 raise her right arm with an open hand and swing toward Youth\nA’s face. Clinician did not see or hear Staff 1’s hand make contact with Youth A.\nClinician stated that this did not appear to be a block or a defensive move as Staff 1\nleaned into the swing. Clinician reported that he and Shift Supervisor placed\nthemselves between Staff 1 and Youth A and continued to attempt verbal de-\nescalation techniques. Clinician spoke with Shift Supervisor to confirm that he saw\nthe swing as well at which time they reported the incident to administration. Clinician\nreported that he was shocked that Staff 1 had done this as he has never seen her\nact this way in the past and has had no concerns with her interactions with youth.\nShift Supervisor – On 6/4/2021 I interviewed Shift Supervisor by phone. Shift\nSupervisor reported that he and Clinician attempted to verbally de-escalate Youth A\nwho was in the hallway area of the unit when Staff 1 entered the area. Youth A\nstarted hitting Staff 1 and Staff 1 responded by swinging with an open hand in a\nslapping motion toward Youth A. Youth A was backing up at the time, so Staff 1’s\n3",
    "hand went over Youth A’s head. He denied seeing Staff 1 make any physical contact\nwith Youth A. Shift Supervisor stated that he and Clinician looked at one another\nwhen it happened, acknowledging that they had both seen the same thing. After\nYouth A was de-escalated, Shift Supervisor and Clinician talked about what they had\nseen and made a report to administration. Shift Supervisor stated that he does not\ntypically work with Staff 1, but he has never seen her do anything like this previously.\nStaff 1 – On 6/4/2021 I interviewed Staff 1 by phone. When provided with the details\nof the allegation, Staff 1 stated that the only time she could recall moving her arm\nwhile Youth A was hitting her was as Youth A was seated and Staff 1 walked past.\nStaff 1 had her arm up to block Youth A from hitting her, then quickly swung her arm\ndown, to block a hit. She stated that she was shocked at how fast she moved her\nown arm, but she was still not able to block the hit to her hip in time. Staff 1 stated\nthat she then continued walking past Youth A. She reported that she did not recall a\ntime that they were standing in the hallway/doorway area while Youth A was hitting\nStaff 1 and denied ever striking toward Youth A.\nDOCUMENTS\nIncident Report - On 6/3/2021 I received and reviewed a copy an Incident Report\n(IR) completed by Clinician on 6/3/2021 in which he documented the same details\nhe reported during his interview.\nStaff Training & Disciplinary History - On 6/6/2021 I received and reviewed a\ncopy of Staff 1’s training records indicating that she is current on her training. On\n6/15/2021 I received and reviewed Staff 1’s disciplinary history which included\ndocumentation of verbal coaching on 3/15/2021 for use of inappropriate language in\nthe workplace and on 4/5/2021 for failure to follow call-in procedure.\nSafety Plan – On 6/2/2021 I spoke with Chief Administrator who indicated that the\nfacility immediately sent Staff 1 home after the incident and she will be placed on\nleave pending the investigation results, ensuring that she would not have any\ncontact with Youth A. On 6/3/2021 I received and reviewed a copy of the safety plan\nwritten by the youth’s assigned foster care worker and which was signed by the\nChief Administrator of the facility. The safety plan indicated that the Staff 1 and\nYouth A would have no contact with one another during the course of this\ninvestigation and that facility staff will continue to follow the previously established\nBehavioral Plan with Youth A.\nPolicy – On 6/14/2021 I received and reviewed a copy of the facility’s Behavior\nManagement policy which states that staff will utilize positive interventions. I also\nreviewed the discipline policy which indicates that any type of corporal punishment is\nprohibited, and that staff are to use Satori Alternatives to Managing Aggression\n(SAMA.) The SAMA Manual outlines that staff members should “slide step” away\nfrom a strike and hold hands together, raising them to forehead height with elbows\nrib cage width apart, and move both arms as a unit slightly to either side to block a\nstrike.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that describe the\ninstitution’s behavior management system. The\npolicies and procedures shall be reviewed annually\nand updated as needed. These shall be available to\nall residents, their families, and referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 did not follow the facility’s policies regarding behavior\nmanagement when Clinician and Shift Supervisor observed her\nstriking her hand toward Youth A.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2020C0112033 dated 8/27/2020, CAP approved 9/9/2020\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\nJune 16, 2021\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 16, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
