DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThe new community based treatment program is part of a new addition to the existing\ncourthouse and secure youth home complex. The entire addition encompasses 15,025\nsq. ft. with approximately 7500 sq. ft housing the open residential program. By design,\nthe new treatment program will segregate the residents in the open program from the\nresidents in the secure unit.\nB. Program Description\nThe open Residential program components are designed to meet each resident’s\nnutritional emotional, spiritual, educational, recreational and physical needs. The\nCharlotte Public Schools will provide the educational program. Youth counseling\nservices are the primary focus of the program. Also, all youth are required to partake in\ngroup counseling 5-7 days per week and issues covered will include but are not limited\nto substance abuse, anger management, goal setting, accountability, male and female\nissues, relationships, moral reasoning and current events. The treatment modality will\nbe a blend of cognitive theory and behavior modification and will include a level system.\nParents will be required to take part in counseling and in parenting classes. Also, there\nwill be aftercare coordinator services provided to both youth and their parents.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nBased on a review of the court-operated facility’s plans to achieve compliance with\napplicable rules and statutes, it has been determined that the facility’s plans are\nacceptable.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend issuance of a provisional certificate of inspection for the Eaton County\nYouth Facility Community Based Treatment Program.\n2",
