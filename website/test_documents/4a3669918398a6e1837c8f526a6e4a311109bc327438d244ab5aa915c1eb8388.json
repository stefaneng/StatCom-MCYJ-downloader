    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription • (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nsuitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Case Aide has inappropriate/intimate relationship with Father.\nFoster Care Worker threatened mother with possible court\nrepercussions associated with visitation expectations.\nInvestigation\nIn the review of the case file, it was determined Youth A is the\nhalf sibling of Youth B and Youth C. Youth A is not a foster child\nand Youth A lives with Youth A's Mother. Youth A's Mother is a\nnonrespondent parent in this case. Youth A, Youth B, and Youth\nC have the same Father who is a respondent in this case due to a\ndomestic violence incident between Father and Youth B. Youth B\nand Youth C have the same mother, but not the same mother as\nYouth A.\nInterviews:\nI attempted to contact Mother by phone for additional information\non 07/28/2025, and twice on 09/30/2025 and left messages for\nMother to respond if any additional information was needed.\nMother responded on 10/06/2025 and was interviewed by phone\non 10/10/2025. Mother reported attorneys were involved and a\ncourt hearing is scheduled for 10/29/2025 regarding Mother’s\ncourt hearing testimony concerns.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator by phone on 07/28/2025.\nChief Administrator denied Foster Care Worker had any kind of\nrelationship with Father outside of case management\nresponsibilities. I interviewed Chief Administrator by phone on\n10/16/2025. Chief Administrator denied Case Aide had any kind\nof relationship with Father outside of a professional relationship.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker by phone on 09/30/2025 and\nFoster Care Worker denied any relationship with Father outside of\ncase management responsibilities. I interviewed Foster Care\nWorker by phone on 10/15/2025. Foster Care Worker denied any\nreason to believe there was/is an inappropriate relationship\nbetween Father and Case Aide.\n2",
    "Foster Care Worker reported there were 3 court hearings. The\nfirst court hearing involving Foster Care Worker was on\n07/28/2025. Foster Care Worker stated attempts to communicate\nwith the mother of Youth A regarding visitation plans included\nsending a visitation calendar to the mother by certified mail on\n08/25, 08/30, 9/9, and 9/13/2025 that were all returned. Foster\nCare Worker stated other means of attempted communication\nincluded text messages, and emails. Foster Care Worker denied\nthreatening the mother of Youth A with repercussions other than\nsharing the consequences/outcomes of not complying with the\nprotocols associated with the visitation plan.\nI interviewed Case Aide by phone on 10/10/2025. Case Aide\ndenied any relationship other than a professional relationship with\nFather. Case Aide stated Case Aide’s only responsibility for the\ncase is the supervision/monitoring of visits and Foster Care\nWorker is responsible for communication with the parties\nassociated with the scheduling of visits.\nI interviewed Father by phone on 09/30/2025 and 10/10/2025.\nFather denied any relationship with Foster Care Worker or Case\nAide outside of fulfilling case management responsibilities.\nI interviewed MDHHS Monitor by phone on 09/30/2025. MDHHS\nMonitor denied Foster Care Worker had any relationship with\nFather outside of case management responsibilities. I exchanged\ntext messages with MDHHS Monitor on 10/16/2025. MDHHS\nMonitor reported absolutely no reason to believe Case Aide had\nanything more than a professional relationship with Father.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed social work contacts and initial and updated service\nplans. The updated service plans documented Parental Visitation\nPlan as weekly, 2 hours, supervised and the Sibling Visitation\nPlan as monthly, 3 hours. This is consistent with the verbal\nstatements reported in interviews.\nThe social work contacts were reviewed, and they were reflective\nof the implementation of the plans. Foster Care Worker had at\nleast 25 documented social work contacts with Complainant from\n04/19/2025 to 09/22/2025.\nI reviewed the most recent court hearing documents dated\n7/25/2025. The court hearing information indicated sibling visits\n3",
    "were occurring consistent with the law and MDHHS/agency has\ndiscretion in the scheduling/monitoring of parental visitation.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with the rule per interviews\nthat were completed. All the parties denied Father and Case Aide\nhad anything other than a professional relationship. Additionally,\nno evidence was found to support Foster Care Worker lied or\nthreaten Mother.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/16/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 17, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
