    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe facility has requested the addition of a Residential Treatment Program. The\nResidential Treatment Program will occupy fourteen single rooms on the 3rd Floor of\nthe building. Ten rooms on the second floor of the facility will continue to be utilized\nas double occupancy rooms for short term programs. Based on these changes, the\ncapacity of the short term programs will be 20 and the capacity of the Residential\nTreatment Program will be 14. The total capacity is 34.\nIII. Methodology\n02/21/2006- Received a written proposal from the Chief Administrator to add a\nResidential Treatment component to Wolverine Center.\n03/03/2006- Onsite inspection of the facility. The rooms identified for the Residential\nTreatment Program were previously utilized for the short term program. The\nEnvironmental and Fire Safety Inspections are current.\n03/06/2006- Received a revised Program Statement for Wolverine Center and a\nrevised Child Caring Institution Application.\n03/20/2006- Modify terms to 20 short term male residents, ages 6-17, and 14 male\nresidential treatment residents, ages 12-17. Decrease total capacity to 34.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nWolverine Human Services is an established nonprofit Child Care Organization.\nWolverine Center has been licensed since January 1988. The facility has previously\nprovided short term care for abused and neglected males and low security\nadjudicated delinquents. The facility had eliminated the delinquent program for a\nshort period of time, but contracted with a new funding source to continue the\nprogram.\nThe facility has requested to add a Residential Treatment component to the\nprogram. The addition of the program will allow the facility to have single rooms for\nresidents who have a history of sexually acting out either prior to or during\nplacement.\nThe facility has the space to accommodate the Residential Treatment Program. The\nrooms to be used for the new program were previously utilized for the short term\nprogram. The Environmental and Fire Safety Inspections are current. The facility is\naware of the need to programmatically and physically separate the short term\nprograms that house adjudicated delinquents (non-status offenders) and\nabuse/neglect wards. This is a Federal Title IV-E requirement. Both short term\nprograms will be on the second floor. They will occupy different sides of the Resident\nHall. A Fire Door separates the two sides. They will continue to have separate\nmeals and recreation activities. Separate Education Programs will continue at the\nonsite self contained classrooms.\n2",
    "The Residential Treatment Program will be housed on the 3rd Floor. Fourteen single\nbeds will be used for this program. The Program will serve youth from 12-17 years of\nage. The addition of the program will allow the facility to have single rooms for\nresidents who have a history of sexually acting out either prior to or during\nplacement.\nMeals, recreational activities, and educational classes for residents in the\nResidential Treatment Program will be separate from the residents in the short term\nprograms. The staffing ratio for the Residential Treatment Program will be 1:7 during\nwaking hours and 1:12 during sleeping hours. Residents will be provided group,\nindividual, and family counseling. The facility plans to require additional training for\nstaff persons assigned to the Residential Treatment Program.\nV. Recommendation\nBased on a revised Program Statement, building inspection, and current Fire and\nEnvironmental Inspections, it is recommended that the request to add a 14 bed\nresidential program is approved The license capacity is decreased to 34 to\naccommodate 20 short term residents, ages 6-17, and 14 Residential Treatment\nresidents, ages 12-17.\n03/20/2006\n________________________________________\nMiriam Berenstein Date\nLicensing Consultant\n3"
