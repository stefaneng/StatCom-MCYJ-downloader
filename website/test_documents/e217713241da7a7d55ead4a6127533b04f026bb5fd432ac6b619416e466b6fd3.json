    "Email from Licensee Designee 1- Copy of a submission form\nshowing 5 boxes of closed adoption records for 48 children files\nwere submitted to Port Huron DHHS on 6/21/2022\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency has not submitted records to MDHHS (Michigan Department of Health\nand Human Services) for permanent retention one year following the final order of\nadoption as required. There are six records that have not been submitted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/23/2022 I reviewed the complaint, and contact was made with the complainant\nvia email by my Peer Consultant. I made initial contact with the agency about the\ncomplaint via email on 5/24/2022.\nOn 5/25/2022, Adoption Departmental Manager (ADM) X provided information about\nthe complaint to me, and a Peer Consultant, via email. ADM X reported her\ndepartment had been in contact with agencies about their closed adoption records.\nThe department had inquired with the agencies as to the status of the closed\nadoption files requested. Her department found that these files either had not been\nsubmitted to the local office at all or were submitted outside the required timeframe\nof 12 to 13 months following finalization. ADM X listed six finalized adoption files for\nEnnis Center for Children-Port Huron that may not have been submitted.\nADM X provided clarity on how the files are to be closed and sent to the County\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) office, and the DHS-788 form to\nbe attached on the closed file boxes. Additionally, ADM X provided information with\nrespect to if an agency still has old closed adoption records outside the ones on the\nlist provided related to the complaint; and what that agency should do with those\nrecords. Whether those closed records should come to ADM X’s office or the\nCounty DHHS Office. ADM X reported, when R400.12713 was updated in 2015,\nagencies were instructed to send their backlogged adoption records directly to\nCentral Office. She reported, it has been seven years and at this point agencies\nshould be caught up, and on schedule to send closed records to the local offices\nbetween 12-13 months following finalization. If an agency still has old closed\nadoption records, her office will work with the agency, accept those old records, so\nas to not have the local county office bombarded with old records. She advised it\nwould be very helpful if the agency would include in any corrective action plan the\nagency’s plan to ensure that Lansing/the department gets those old records.\nOn 5/26/2022 via telephone and 6/15/2022 via onsite visit, I interviewed Licensee\nDesignee 1. He also reported information via email on 5/24/2022. Licensee\nDesignee 1 reported no one ever asked for the six records until recently in April\n2022. He said the agency received a letter from Lansing asking for the closed\nadoption records for Child A, Child B, Child C, Child D, Child E, and Child F. The\n3",
    "letter indicated a deadline of 4/27/2022 for when those closed adoption records were\nto be submitted; and Ennis-Purton Huron met that deadline. The agency dropped\nChild A, Child B’s, Child C’s, Child D’s, Child E’s and Child F’s closed records off to\nPort Huron County DHHS on 4/26/2022. They discovered later, Child E’s and Child\nF’s files went to Port Huron County in error. These two records should have gone to\nMacomb County DHHS. The agency retrieved those records from Port Huron DHHS\nand submitted them to Macomb DHHS on 5/24/2022. Licensee Designee 1 provided\ndocumentation showing the respective submissions.\nLicensee Designee 1 expressed concern that a complaint was made related to the\nagency when they met the deadline. Especially since he knows other agencies who\ndid not submit timely, and those agency did not get a complaint. He also expressed\nconcerns, which his adoption administrator reported to him related to difficulties, in\nthe past, trying to submit closed records to the county DHHS offices. He reported\nthat varies offices were wanting the record closed a specific way, or the county office\nwas refusing to take records because that county office, at the time, did not know\nwhat to do with the boxes of records being submitted. He reported, Ennis-Port\nHuron currently has 52-54 finalized adoption records that go back to 2019, which\nneed to be sorted/effectively closed out and submitted to DHHS. The agency’s plan\nis to have these records dropped off to the county offices by 6/23/2022.\nLicensee Designee 1 reported the agency’s plan to stay rule compliant going forward\nis to utilize its billing sheet for the child’s finalization as a tickler. As soon as the\nbilling sheet shows they billed one year back, they will drop off the closed adoption\nrecord within two weeks of that date. The agency will document closed record\nsubmissions to the DHHS county office via a receipt acknowledge signoff form. The\nagency’s clerical staff will track these finalization and record the submission via a\nspreadsheet. The actual adoption record submission receipt acknowledgement\nforms will be maintained in a binder, so as to compare to the billing sheet.\nDuring my on-site visit on 6/15/2022, I observed the agency’s secure closed file\nadoption storage room; and saw records were in the process of being put together\nand boxed.\nReviewed:\n A copy of an adoption file records list from Adoption Departmental Manager\nX; the agency closed record submission receipt acknowledgement forms, all\nas referenced earlier in this report.\n A copy of a closed record submission receipt acknowledgement form showing\n5 boxes of closed adoption records for 48 children files were submitted to Port\nHuron DHHS. This document was received by email from Licensee Designee\n1, on 6/21/2022, who indicated the remaining six records will be dropped off\nnext week.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12713 Adoption placement record.\n(5) The Michigan department of human services must\npermanently retain all adoption records for children\nadopted from Michigan's child welfare system. The\nadoption agency must forward any adoption records for\nchildren adopted from the Michigan child welfare system to\nthe department one year after finalization of the adoption.\nThe adoption agency may not retain the original copies or\nany other copies of the adoption records.\nANALYSIS: With respect to the six adoption records named in the complaint;\nthe agency submitted those records to DHHS by the 4/27/2022\nresponse date listed in the letter to the agency. Those adoptions\nwere finalized in October and November 2020; and their\nsubmissions to the department was after the timeframe stated in\nthe rule.\nAdditionally, the agency admitted it had 52-54 outstanding\nfinalized adoption records going back to 2019 which it had not\nsubmitted to DHHS. These records are beyond the 12–13-\nmonth timeframe the department allows after adoption\nfinalization for record submission. The agency is in violation of\nrule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n_______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date June 22, 2022\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
