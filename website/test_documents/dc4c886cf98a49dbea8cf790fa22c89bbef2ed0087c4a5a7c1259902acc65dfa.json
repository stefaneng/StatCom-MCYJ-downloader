Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nAgency communicated inappropriately with foster parents. There were additional\nconcerns that agency was not completing reports timely, was losing documents, and\nunjustly denied a license to foster parents.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 7/15/2021 I received an on-line complaint from Applicant A stating that Worker 1\ntold her that she would be approved for foster home licensing by January of 2021,\nbut Worker 1 has not yet completed her report. Applicant A indicated that Worker 1\ninitially told her that they would be approved, but later told Applicant A that she was\nrecommending denial of licensure. Applicant A also stated Worker 1 continually asks\nfor additional information from the family and asks them the same questions multiple\ntimes.\nOn 7/15/2021 I reviewed Applicant A’s MiSACWIS record in which there was not a\ncompleted licensing certification report or recommendation.\nOn 7/22/2021, 8/5/2021, and 8/13/2020 I interviewed Applicant A by phone.\nApplicant B was also present during the calls and could be heard interjecting at\ntimes from the background. Applicant A reported that she was applying to be\nlicensed in order to adopt her Godchildren who were in care in a different state.\nApplicant A reported Worker 1 reported to the family upon their first meeting that\nthey would be licensed by January of 2021. In February of 2021, Worker 1 told the\nfamily that the process was taking longer than expected, but that they would be\nlicensed by March. Worker 1 told the applicants that they would need to make\nrenovations to the home and would need bunkbeds prior to the home being\napproved. Applicant A reported that she and Applicant B borrowed $50,000 to make\nthe renovation which included adding a bedroom and bathroom and that Worker 1\nobtained the bunkbeds for the prospective placements in April. When the family\nhadn’t heard anything from Worker 1 by May of 2021, they called Supervisor 1 who\ntold the family that the licensing report with recommendation would be submitted by\nMay 17. When Applicant A spoke to Worker 1 about the delay, Worker 1 told the\n4",
    "family that she was overwhelmed and working nights and weekends causing her to\nmiss time with her husband. Applicant A stated that she and Applicant B attended a\nmeeting with Program Manager, Supervisor 1, and Worker 1 in June during which\nWorker 1 stated there were no barriers to completing her report, but she needed to\ninclude a police report she recently received. On 7/12/2021 Applicants A & B\nattended a Zoom meeting with Worker 1 and Supervisor 1 during which Worker 1\naccused them of lying, failing to be forthcoming, and violating licensing rules so she\nwould be denying them for licensure.\nApplicant A stated that Worker 1 gave the family “verbal approval” multiple times and\nmade several excuses as to why the licensing process was taking so long, including\nother priorities taking precedence over their report.\nOn 7/22/2021 I interviewed Worker 1 in person. Worker 1 reported that her\nrelationship with Applicant A & Applicant B started out positively. She reported the\nfamily attended orientation and submitted an application on 9/21/2020. Worker 1\nstated that she initially thought the family would be licensable, which she\ncommunicated to the family. She stated that she began to question whether they\nwould be licensable, which she communicated to the family in November of 2020;\nhowever, Worker 1 also reported that she helped obtain Christmas presents for the\nfamily’s children and assisted them in obtaining beds for the youth for whom they\nwere applying to take placement. She stated that she completed an initial\nwalkthrough of the family’s home on 1/13/2021 and informed the family that they\nwould need to make some repairs to their home, including replacing carpet in two\nbedrooms and “updating” those rooms before they could be licensed. She stated\nthat the family replaced the entire 2nd floor carpeting and renovated their whole\nbasement, including adding an additional bedroom for which she had previously\nprovided them information regarding Family Incentive Grant funding requests. She\nenrolled the family on 2/24/2021 and completed a second walkthrough of the home\non 4/8/2021 at which time she believed the family was licensable. She reported that\nshe requested updated financial information on 4/29/2021 and updated medical\nstatements on 5/20/2021 statements made by the physicians in the medical\nstatements required additional follow-up and clarification. On 6/1/2021 Worker 1 and\nSupervisor 1 held a meeting with the applicants after which a request was made by\nWorker 1 to meet with the assigned DCWL Central Office Consultant to discuss her\nreport. That meeting took place on 6/17/2021 during which DCWL Central Office\nConsultant requested that additional information be obtained. On 6/17/2021 Worker\n1 requested additional documents from service providers, which she reviewed on\n6/28/2021. On 7/12/2021 another meeting was held with the applicants during which\nWorker 1 informed them of her denial recommendation.\nWorker 1 reported that she maintained regular communication with the family until\nthe last “several months” during which her communication lessened as she was\nwaiting for and reviewing records. She stated that it was possible the family believed\nthat she was going to recommend them for licensure prior to the July 12th meeting\nfor which Worker 1 felt “bad about.”\n5",
    "Worker 1 reported the licensing of Applicants A & B has taken an “exceptionally long\ntime” because there was a hiring freeze that resulted in Worker 1 needing to take on\nadditional job responsibilities. She stated that she also had an influx of new inquiries\nand had other cases that took precedence over Applicants A & B, including relative\nlicensure, ICPC cases, and back-to-back denials. Worker 1 also stated that she had\ninitially reviewed the family’s DHHS history and did not have any concerns, but when\nit came time to write her report, she looked at the history more closely and\ndetermined there were inconsistencies with DHHS reports and the family’s self-\nreport, which led to Worker 1 needed to obtain additional documentation, including\nreports from service providers. Additionally, Worker 1 stated that she had concerns\nwith one of the children in Applicant A & B’s home, which resulted in her obtaining\ndocuments from law enforcement and service providers, which she still had not fully\nreviewed at the time of this interview. She added that there is a lot of documentation\nto sort through due to the family sometimes providing paperwork in triplicate and\nsome of the documents not containing consistent information. Additionally, there\nwere multiple law enforcement and service provider reports for her to sort through\nand read, which has added to the delay in completing her report and providing a\nrecommendation.\nAt the time of Worker 1’s interview, her home study of Applicants A & B had not yet\nbeen completed. She reported that she was planning to review their paperwork the\nday of the interview and was dedicating the next week to completing the report and\nexpected it to be completed by the end of the week, 7/30/3021.\nOn 7/22/2021 I interviewed Supervisor 1 in person. She reported that she has been\nsupervising Worker 1 since May of 2021. She stated that it is not like Worker 1 to be\nthis late in completing the licensing process and that Worker 1 told Supervisor 1 that\nshe was overwhelmed by work and had a lot of documents to go through which has\nled to the delay. Supervisor 1 stated that she had a conversation with Applicant A\nnear the end of May 2021 during which she told her she expected the report to be\ndone by Memorial Day. Supervisor 1 reported that Worker 1 told her that she still\nbelieved the family would be licensable at that time but would require a variance.\nSupervisor 1 stated that “more information kept coming out” which led to further\ndelay and meeting was held with the applicants in June to allow them to self-disclose\ninformation Worker 1 believed them to be withholding. That did not happen so a\nmeeting was held with DCWL Central Office Consultant who advised Worker 1 to\nobtain additional information.\nSupervisor 1 stated that she has no concerns with Worker 1 and that the cause of\nthe excessive timeframe in this case was due to Worker 1 being overworked as\nthere was a hiring freeze and she was assigned ICPC cases. Supervisor 1 stated\nthat Worker 1 has worked weekends and nights to complete her work.\nOn 7/27/2021 I interviewed Program Manager by phone. She stated that she has\nhad multiple conversations about Applicant A & B’s licensing process with\n6",
    "Supervisor 1 and Worker 1. Program Manager stated that discrepancies started to\ncome out with the information provided by the applicants resulting in the need for\nWorker 1 to make a lot of collateral contacts and hundreds of documents for Worker\n1 to sort through. Program Manager stated that as Worker 1 sorts through the\ndocuments, additional questions are raised. Program Manager stated that Worker 1\nin doing a thorough job of assessing the family. Program Manager stated that\nWorker 1 is dedicated and had a lot of work to do around the holidays, including\nICPC cases which were added to her responsibilities.\nOn July 29, 2021, Director was interviewed by phone. She reported that she met\nwith Program Manager, Worker 1, and Supervisor 1 after learning of this\ninvestigation and found the length of time the report was taking to be unacceptable.\nShe stated that unless there is something specific Worker 1 was waiting on, there\nshould be no reason for the recommendation to take as long as this has. She stated\nthat it was inappropriate for Worker 1 to tell the family they would be licensed before\nmaking a recommendation and that the denial recommendation should have been\ncommunicated to the family much earlier. Director reported that there was no reason\nthis family’s case needed to be pushed to the bottom of Worker 1’s priorities and that\nit had never come to Director’s attention that the licensing staff were overwhelmed to\nthe point of being unable to complete tasks timely. Director added that Worker 1 is\ntypically timely and that it has never taken this long for the agency to license a\nfamily. At the time of the interview, Director 1 reported that she had not yet received\na copy of Worker 1’s report.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12308 Application submission.\n(1) An agency shall act on a completed and signed\napplication.\nANALYSIS: Applicants A & B completed and signed an application on\n9/21/2020 after which the family was not enrolled until\n2/24/2021. The completed home study with recommendation\nwas not approved until 8/4/2021. The agency did not actively\nwork on the completed and signed application due to the length\nof time it took to make a recommendation regarding licensure\nduring which there were periods of time during which no\nprogress was made.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nCONSULTATION:\nDuring my conversation with Director, I provided consultation regarding the\nconfusion the family experienced due to Worker 1 communicating to the family that\nthey would be licensed without completing her assessment of recommendation.\n7",
    "Additionally, we discussed the unprofessional conversations with the family about\nWorker 1 missing time with her own family so she could work on the family’s\nevaluation.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\nAugust 26, 2021\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 26, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
