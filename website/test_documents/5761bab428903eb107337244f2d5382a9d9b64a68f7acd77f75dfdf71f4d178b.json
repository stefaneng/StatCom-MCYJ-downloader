Staff reported they feel well supported by their direct supervisor and\nadministration team. They reported over the past years there has been an increase\nin pay which has resulted in staff staying longer and more qualified staff coming to\nwork at the facility. When staff were asked if there was anything they wanted to\nchange at the facility, staff responded in wanting to work towards giving the youth\nmore choices such as choosing what sport they want to play or what activity they\nwant to do on the pod. This was shared with administration.\nYouth interviews were conducted during the inspection. The youth reported they\nfeel safe at the facility and are treated well by staff. The youth reported they feel\ntheir grievances have all been taken seriously and have been addressed by\nadministration. They reported staff use verbal de-escalation skills more than going\nhands on with a youth and noted staff only goes hands on when there is a safety\nissue. One youth reported concerns that the kitchen staff do not always take the\ndiet restrictions seriously and have to be reminded. The youth reported that he is\nsupposed to eat only soft foods and has been provided some items that are harder\nto eat, which he then has to ask for new food which is provided to him. This\nfeedback was shared with administration.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn onsite inspection and walkthrough of the facility occurred on August 8, 2024.\nThere were no issues or safety concerns noted.\nVII.
