Staff 2 reported Youth D is 18 years\nold and can stay with his father. Staff 2 reported she assumed the\nvisit with Father was approved but should have taken the initiative\nto double check. Staff 2 reported when she dropped Youth A and\nYouth B off at the home she went into the house for a while to\nverify safety and then left.

Youth D confirmed the address he gave\nYouth A and Youth B to put on their visitation form was the\naddress of his father.\n4",
    "Document Review:\n• A agency form, titled ‘Transportation Request Form” for\nYouth A, also found in the waste basket, lists the address\nof Father’s residence which is then crossed out and\nRelative 1’s address inserted.\n• The Program Manager found the agency “Outing/Late\nCurfew/Overnight Request Form” for Youth B in a waste\nbasket in Staff 3’s office. The request lists the address of\nFather.\n• Michigan Sex Offender Registry search revealed Father is\nlisted on the registry.\nAnalysis Youth A and Youth B filled out the visitation form and listed the\naddress provided to them by Youth D, assuming it was the\naddress of Relative 1. Youth A and Youth B reported the visitation\nforms were approved by Staff 3.\nStaff 3 reported she approved the visitation forms and verified the\naddress as Relative 1’s. Staff 3 reported she had verified the visit\nwith Relative 1. Relative 1 denied knowing anything about the\nvisit. The “Outing/Late Curfew/Overnight Request Form” for Youth\nA lists Father’s address. This contradicts Staff 3’s report of\nverifying the address as that of Relative 1’s. Relative 1 reported\nthat she did not speak with Staff 3 about a visit and this\ncontradicts Staff 1’s report.\nStaff 2 did not appropriately verify what address Youth A and\nYouth B were to be taken or vet the home of the father.\nYouth A and Youth B were taken to the home of a registered sex\noffender and left there for a visit.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
