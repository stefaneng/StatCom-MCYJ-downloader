In this example the foster home license\nhad an expiration date of 07/21/2022 and the report recommending renewal was\nsigned 07/20/2022.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED Previously cited Renewal 05/15/2021, CAP\nApproved 06/02/2021.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of the\nfollowing information:\n(d) Dates and places of contacts, names of persons\ninterviewed, and names of the interviewers.

Documentation of an updated\nphysical was not located at the time of this review.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each child\nand parent or parents, as follows:\n(b) Within 120 calendar days after the initial removal and at\nleast once every 90 calendar days thereafter.\nTwo of the six foster child records reviewed indicated at least one updated service\nplan was not completed within the time frame established by this rule. In the first\nexample the youth had an updated service plan with a time period ending\n04/19/2022 that was completed 04/26/2022. The second youth had an updated\nservice plan with a time period ending 10/09/2021 that was completed 10/27/2021.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED Previously cited Renewal 05/15/2021, CAP\nApproved 06/02/2021.\nR 400.12422 Foster care record.\n(3) The record shall contain all of the following information:\n(e) Change of placement documentation as required by R\n400.12405.\nTwo of the four closed foster child records reviewed did not include change in\nplacement documentation as required by this rule. The identified closure dates for\n6",
    "these two changes were 06/23/2022 and 02/03/2022 respectively.

In this example the\ntime period ended 07/30/2021 and the updated service plan was not completed\nuntil 09/22/2021. It was reported at the time of the exit conference this appeared to\nbe the consequence of a staff member who is no longer employed with this agency.\nR 400.12504 Eligibility requirements.\n(2) All of the following shall be in the case record before a\nyouth is placed in independent living:\n(a) How the youth meets the eligibility requirements for\nthe specific program the youth is being placed into.\n(b) The basis for concluding that a youth exhibits self-\ncare potential.\n(c) That the youth’s social service worker has personally\nobserved and determined that the living situation is safe\nand that the youth has a bed and has access to cooking\nand bathing facilities.\n(d) The availability of specific and relevant resources\nthat may provide for suitable social, physical,\neducational, vocational, and emotional needs of a youth.\n(e) An evaluation of a youth's need for supervision and a\nplan for providing the level of supervision determined\nnecessary.\n(f) Proof that financial support to meet the youth’s\nhousing, clothing, food, and miscellaneous expenses is\navailable.\nThe one independent living record reviewed did not include documentation of the\neligibility requirements identified by this rule. In this example the youth had an\nidentified independent living placement date of 05/20/2020. Although this\ndocumentation could not be located the most recent updated service plan dated\n04/26/2022 indicated the youth is doing exceptionally well in his independent living\nplacement.\nR 400.12505 Supervision.\n7",

The most\ncommon omissions involved Parent Agency Treatment Plans (PATP) that had\nsignatures as required and Updated Service Plans (USP) that had signatures as\nrequired.\n3.)

Although there are 17 violations\ncited in this inspection, it is notable that five are related to the two special\nevaluations reviewed and four were related to the one independent living file\nreviewed. The agency should spend time focusing on those two areas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment included a review of the corrective action plan\nthat was implemented to address areas of noncompliance in the renewal evaluation\ncompleted 05/05/2021.
