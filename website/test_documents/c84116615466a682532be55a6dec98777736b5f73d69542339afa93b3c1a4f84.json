    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Incident reporting\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4150\nSection (3) If an institution determines that a youth is absent without legal\nDescription permission, then the institution shall immediately report the\ninformation to law enforcement, the parent/legal guardian or next\nof kin, the licensing authority, and the referring agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that Youth A AWOLed and the referring agency did\nnot receive notification of the AWOL.\nInvestigation On 9/9/24, I spoke to Complainant. No new information was\nprovided.\nOn 9/9/24, I spoke to Foster Care Worker 1 (FCW 1). FCW 1\nreported she was never notified of Youth A AWOLing from the\nfacility. FCW 1 reported the AWOL occurred the week of 8/25/24.\nFCW 1 did not have the specific date. FCW 1 reported she had\nmade numerous phone calls, and no one was returning her phone\ncall.\nOn 9/9/24, I spoke to Administrator 1. Administrator 1 did not\nprovide any new details.\nI spoke to Administrator 2. Administrator 2 reported Youth A\nAWOLed on 8/22/24. Administrator 2 reported Therapist 1 wrote\nthe incident report and stated she sent the incident report to\nFCW 1 on 8/22/24. There were no other AWOLS for that week.\nAdministrator 1 was asked if Administrator 3 would be aware of\nAWOLs at the facility and Administrator 2 reported he is not\ninvolved in the day-to-day activities and may not be able to\ndistinguish between an AWOL and a youth walking away from the\ngroup, (which is not an AWOL).\nI spoke to Therapist 1. Therapist 1 reported she sent Youth A’s\nincident report concerning his AWOL on 8/22/24 to FCW 1 on\n8/22/24. Therapist 1 reported she is the one who communicates\nwith the youth’s workers. Therapist 1 reported the only AWOLS for\nYouth A were the ones with incident reports noted.\n2",
    "Documents Reviewed:\n• Incident report dated 8/22/24. The Incident report is written\nby Therapist 1 and does note that FCW 1 was informed of\nthe incident and received the Incident Report.\n• Email from FCW 1 to Therapist 1. The email is dated\n8/23/24. The email reads as follows and had the Incident\nreport attached:\no Good afternoon, we received a voicemail message\ntoday indicating [Youth A] has been AWOL since\nyesterday-could someone from Holy Cross provide\nadditional details? We are in need of the report\nnumber associated with the police report noting\nthem as AWOL. What additional actions have been\ntaken to resolve the AWOL episode…\n• Email thread from FCW 1 to Therapist 1:\no On 8/30/24, FCW 1 requested more incident reports\nvia email for a specific AWOL, dated 8/26/24. FCW 1\nindicated that Administrator 3 told her this occurred.\nTherapist 1 sent FCW 1 all the incident reports she\nhad for the month of August 2024.There was no\nincident report for this date.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule.\n• FCW 1 was informed of the 8/22/24 AWOL immediately\nafter it happened.\n• On 8/30/24, FCW 1 inquired about an AWOL that allegedly\noccurred on 8/26/24. There is not an incident report for an\nAWOL and both Administrator 2 and Therapist 1 reported\nthere was not an AWOL for that date.\n• Administrator 3 is not involved in day-to-day operations and\nwould not know specific youth behaviors or specific dates\nto AWOLs. FCW 1 did not obtain information from\nTherapist 1, which is the normal communication route.\nWhen she did communicate with Therapist 1, she received\ninformation that there was not an AWOL on 8/26/24.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
