    "II. ALLEGATION:\nViolation\nEstablished?\nStaff allowed Youth D to use her phone which is against agency Yes\npolicy\nYouth D’s email account was open on Staff 1’s personal device. Staff 1 saw the\nyouth had emailed nude selfies to someone. Staff 1 is concerned Youth D is\nbeing groomed by human traffickers.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n04/20/2021 Special Investigation Intake\n2021C0108034\n04/20/2021 Special Investigation Initiated - Telephone\nNotified CA 1 of allegation re: possible agency policy violation\n04/20/2021 Contact - Telephone call made\nInterviewed Staff 1\n04/22/2021 Exit Conference-\nThe incident and policy violation were confirmed by CA1\nALLEGATION:\nYouth D’s email account was open on Staff 1’s personal device. Staff 1 saw the\nyouth had emailed nude selfies to someone. Staff 1 is concerned Youth D is\nbeing groomed by human traffickers.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Staff 1 by phone on 4/20/21. During the interview she was at the Redford\nPolice Station in the process of reporting her concerns to the authorities. Staff 1 said\nshe discovered Youth D, age 15, had emailed nude selfies to someone after borrowing\nher phone to sign-in to his email account. Staff 1 saw the emails and pictures because\nhe mistakenly left his email account open on her phone. What she viewed led her to\nsuspect the youth is being groomed by human traffickers. Staff 1 reported her concern\n2",
    "first to the child protection agency, then to the Redford Police in person and finally to the\nMethodist’s Chief Administrator.\nChief Administrator 1 (CA1) contacted me after business hours on 4/20/21, stating Staff\n1 had finally shared the above information with her. While Staff 1 acted correctly by\nreporting her concerns directly to authorities, CA 1 confirmed that allowing Youth D to\nborrow her phone violated Methodist’s staff behavior policy. CA 1 will alert Youth’s D’s\ntreatment team to incorporate sex education into his treatment plan in order to protect\nhim from human traffickers.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, and discharge of residents.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 did not follow the agency’s policy that prohibits staff from\nallowing youth to use their personal electronic devices.\nOtherwise, upon discovering Youth D’s email and photos, Staff\n1 acted appropriately by reporting her concerns about possible\nhuman trafficking to the police.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nApril 21, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 22, 2021\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n3"
