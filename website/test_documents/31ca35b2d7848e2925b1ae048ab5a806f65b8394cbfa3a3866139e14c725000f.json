    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this\nrule:\n(c) Verification of high school diploma or GED when\nspecified by rule.\nTwo of thirteen new staff did not have verification of\ncompletion of high school or a GED prior to being hired.\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this\nrule:\n(j) A written evaluation of the employee's performance within\n30 days of the completion of the probationary period or within\n180 days, whichever is less, and a written evaluation of the\nemployee’s performance annually thereafter.\nNine of seventeen staff were missing either a 90-day or\nannual performance evaluation for 2021.\n(Repeat violation from Interim 2020 with approved CAP on\n01/25/2021)\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(1) The licensee shall provide an orientation program for new\nemployees. Job shadowing shall not be the only form of\norientation. The orientation shall include the following:\n(a) The institution's purpose, policies, and procedures,\nincluding discipline, crisis intervention techniques, and\nemergency and safety procedures.\n4",
    "While there was some evidence that new staff were\noriented, seven of thirteen staff were missing the document\nthat verifies it (Orientation Training Guide).\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(3) The licensee shall document that each staff person whose\nfunction is covered by these rules has participated in a minimum\nof 50 clock hours of planned training within the first year of\nemployment and a minimum of 25 clock hours of training\nannually thereafter related to the employee’s job function. At\nleast 16 of the 50 hours provided in the first year shall be\norientation provided prior to the assumption of duties.\nTwo of four employee files did not have a minimum of 25\nhours of training annually in 2021.\nR 400.4152 Initial documentation.\nAt the time of admission, all of the following shall be in the\nresident's case record:\n(c) A brief description of the resident's preparation for\nplacement and general physical and emotional state at the time\nof admission.\nThree of three youth files did not describe how Vista Maria\nstaff prepared them on the day of admission. One intake\nworker described how another agency may have prepared\nthe youth prior to placement at Vista. A second intake\nworker indicated the youth was interviewed and would be\noriented but does not orient youth herself. A third intake\nworker left this section blank.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there\nare additional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.

    "RFCAN 2.10 Planned Discharge Medication (DHHS – 5921\npg 27 updated 3/21)\nFour of six discharge medication forms were not\nsigned by the person to whom the youth was\ndischarged.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTo assure future compliance with discharge rules and contracts, I recommended\nDHHS – form 5921 completed by Health Services and the two-page client discharge\nform completed by the social services worker and supervisor be attached and placed\ntogether in the file. Both forms should be signed by the person receiving the\ndischarged youth.\nV. CONSULTATION\nRe: Rule 152 (c) cited above, the actual staff person who orients the youth to her\nliving quarters (i.e., tour of building, introductions, bedroom, youth handbook,\ntherapist, etc.) should be the person who documents this on the Client Information\nform on the day of admission.\n6",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse during this licensing period.\nIn this investigation the facility was cited when a staff person physically pulled a youth\nand was subsequently deemed unsuitable to work with children. The corrective\naction plan included terminating the staff’s employment.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThis investigation involved a staff person using improper restraint techniques and\ninappropriate discipline. That staff person was terminated.\nThe facility submitted one acceptable corrective action plan unrelated to maltreatment\nduring this licensing period.\nThis investigation involved the facility being cited for improper restraint after a staff\nperson failed to follow the physical management techniques established at the\nfacility. The corrective action included a review of the restraint and staff role plays at\nan all-staff meeting.\nAt the Interim inspection of 2020, Vista Maria Mental Health was cited for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records (j)\nFinally, Vista Maria Mental Health plans to renovate Rose Hall to add calming rooms\nand family activity rooms. The youth residing in Rose Hall will be moved to other\nbuildings on campus during this time. The renovation is expected to be completed in\nMay 2022.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MSA requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 10, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n7",
