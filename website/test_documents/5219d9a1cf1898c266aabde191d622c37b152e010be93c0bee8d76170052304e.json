Staff 1 reported that he did not see the alleged incident.

Staff 1 reported that Resident A and B\nneeded to be closer to staff in order to appropriately supervise the residents. Later in\nthe evening Staff 1 reported that he put the information received from Resident A\ninto the shift log book and recommended that Resident A and B should be closely\nmonitored while swimming at the beach.
