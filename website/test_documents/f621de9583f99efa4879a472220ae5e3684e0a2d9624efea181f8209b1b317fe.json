    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nTitle qualifications\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth N alleged Staff 1 and Staff 2 gave her vapes on an\nunidentified date.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI notified Complainant, also Doctor, via email that this investigation\nwas assigned. He expressed no additional concerns regarding\nVista Maria.\nI notified Youth N’s MDHHS worker of the investigation, and she\nexpressed no additional concerns.\nI interviewed Youth N at Kingswood Hospital on 2/1/24. She was\nplaced at Vista Maria in May 2023 and said she has been\npsychiatrically and medically hospitalized four times since then.\nShe understood and agreed to comply with the ground rules of the\nforensic interview.\nApproximately October 2023, Youth N said she asked Staff 1 to\nget her a nicotine vape. Staff 1 agreed and handed her a new\nvape in her bedroom the next day. The bedrooms do not have\ncameras. Youth N said the brand of the vape was Breeze and\nflavor was strawberry kiwi – the kind sold at liquor stores and gas\nstations. Youth N said she has been using marijuana and vaping\nnicotine since she was age 12. She usually purchases the vapes\nherself as she appears older than her age. Youth N said she hid\nthe strawberry kiwi nicotine vape under her mattress and used it at\nnight in her room until it was empty. Then she threw the empty\ncartridge in the community bathroom trash. Youth N said youths\nand staff take out the trash, and the empty vape would not have\nnecessarily been noticed by whoever disposed of it.\nAlso in October 2023, Youth N said she saw a vape in Staff 2’s\npurse and asked her for it. “Staff 2 let me have hers with nicotine\nleft…She handed it to me in my room where there are no\n2",
    "cameras. I hit it three times and it went out. I threw it in the same\nbathroom trash.”\nYouth N denied receiving vapes from any other staff members at\nVista Maria. She said she is unaware of Staff 1, Staff 2 or any\nother staff providing vapes to other youths.\nOn 2/27/24, during a forensic interview I attended at Kids-Talk\nregarding another matter, Forensic Interviewer asked Youth N if\nstaff at Vista Maria ever gave her vapes. Youth N denied that any\nstaff, including Staff 2, ever gave her vapes.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present on 2/8/24. She has worked at the facility for ten\nmonths. Staff 1 said she has been assigned to monitor Youth N\non 1:1 and “every time, she acts a fool, banging her head.”\nGovernment Worker 1 read the allegation aloud. Staff 1 stated “I\ndon’t even vape. That’s crazy she made that accusation. I know\nshe really doesn’t care for me.” Staff 1 denied knowledge of any\nother staff giving youths vapes.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present on 2/1/24. She said she was sometimes assigned\nto supervise Youth N on 1:1. She said Youth N self-harms by\nhitting her head on the wall, likes rap music and is religious.\nGovernment Worker 1 read the allegation aloud. Staff 2 denied it\nand asked “I gave her a vape? I don’t even smoke vapes.”\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed Staff 1’s and Staff 2’s employee records. Both had\nattendance-based write-ups, but neither were disciplined for\ndisplaying inappropriate behaviors toward youth. The facility\nterminated Staff 2’s employment on 2/8/24 regarding another\nmatter.\nThere were no incident reports indicating Youth N was ever found\nin possession of a vape.\nI reviewed Vista Maria’s Employee Behavior Policy. It prohibits\ngiving gifts/items of value to clients without immediate supervisor\napproval. It prohibits smoking on campus or in vehicles but does\nnot prohibit staff from carrying nicotine products inside of their\npurses.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\n3",
    "Analysis Youth N told Complainant on 1/28/24 and me on 2/1/24 that Staff\n1 and Staff 2 gave her vapes at the facility. During a forensic\ninterview at Kids-Talk on 2/27/24, Youth N denied that any staff at\nVista Maria ever gave her vapes.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nFebruary 29, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 8, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n4"
