This CAP related to the agency’s 2023 Interim inspection\ncompleted on 10/6/2024 where the CAP was approved on 12/11/2023. The\nagency received 16 violations in that 2023 inspection 8 of which are repeat\nviolations this year. The agency’s compliance around these 6 rule violations is as\nfollows: 5 of them saw an increased related to the number of individual cases\ncited: R400.12405(5) (a)&(b) increased from 1 of 5 to 6 of 6, R400.12419(1)(c)\nincreased from 1 of 5 to 2 of 4, R400.12420(g) increased from 1 of 6 to 3 of 6,\nFOM 722-6B increased from 2 of 6 to 3 of 6, and FOM 722-8D increased from 3\nof 6 to 5 of 6.

    "• Its on line spreadsheet created to track CPR and first aid certification for\nfoster home. The agency did not receive any noncompliance in this area.\n• Samples of foster care staff meeting agendas and supervisor meeting\nagendas showing the discussions of CAP action items.\n• Sample of emails showing reminders to staff related to report due dates\nand time frames, as well as medical and dentals due dates and time frames\n• The use of checklists was seen during licensing and foster care file reviews,\nas were CPS transfer documents for five-day packages, and social work\ncontacts by the HLO (Health Liaison Officer) to family about initial\nmedicals/dentals.\nThe agency’s efforts to complete this CAP resulted in slight progress in various\nareas. The agency was not totally successful with all, especially as it relates to\ncompletion of DHS-69s, which when completed can show verification of\ninformation required for R400.12405 -Change of placement. The agency reported\nits staff’s lack of consistent document uploads contributes/impacts its\ndemonstrated compliance in some licensing areas. Notwithstanding, the agency\nreports it will continue its efforts to improve, achieve and illustrate compliance in all\nareas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency provided a chief administrator's report dated 6/30/2024. The\nadministrator reported the main barrier impacting compliance over the last year\nrelated to areas cited in the last inspection was staffing changes. Additionally, that\nthe reason for repeat noncompliance, having an impact on the achievement of the\ncorrective action plan was all staff not fully understanding the audit’s findings,\ndespite multiple explanations, and supervisors not consistently using the tools\nidentified in the corrective action plan, as well as supervisors not ensuring FTMs\nare held per policy, and that all documents are uploaded, as required.\nThe administrator also reported concern with the court ordering youths into/out of\nplacements without/against the agency's recommendation, which has resulted in\nunplanned replacements for youths.\nOn an encouraging note, the administrator reported the agency has created a\nspreadsheet to track CPR and first aid certifications for foster homes and it offers\nin-person certification training twice a year for foster parents. Additionally, that\nthat the agency had regular CAP review meetings scheduled for the entire year,\nand this information is shared at monthly foster care unit meetings, and in\nindividual case conferences. The administrator also reported the agency has\nsecured a supervisor loan from another county and it continues to try to secure\nadditional staff as able.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable, this is a state agency.\nStaff and Youth Interviews",
    "In addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, section manager, and one\nsupervisor during the entrance conference, I interviewed three foster care workers,\nand a licensing worker. Staff reported team camaraderie, managerial support, the\nagency’s great efforts to meet timeframes and deadline, and co-workers kindness\nand willingness to help with client referrals/resources. Areas of limitations\nreported included, inconsistency in the timeliness of communication, the need for\nmore staff, more consistent demonstrated staff support, and having a mentor\nassigned to new staff.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the site area was conducted and did not reveal any safety\nconcerns. Case files were properly stored and secured.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nOctober 10, 2024\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 14, 2024\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nArea Manager"
