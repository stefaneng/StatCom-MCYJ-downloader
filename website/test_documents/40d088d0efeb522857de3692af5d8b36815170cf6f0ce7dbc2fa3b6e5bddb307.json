Staff Person 1 interviewed.\n04/15/2021 Exit conference.\nALLEGATION: Staff grabbed youth around neck making it difficult for him to breath\nwhile threatening to hurt youth, call the police, and tell others youth assaulted staff.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed intake dated 03/12/2021. It states Youth A was kicking his shoes at the\nstaff desk where Staff Person 1 was sitting. Staff Person 1 told Youth A to go to his\nroom and sit down and that Staff Person 1came up to Youth A and grabbed him with\nboth hands around his neck, making it difficult for Youth A to breath. Staff Person 1\ntold Youth A that he would \"(expletive) him up, call the cops, and tell them Youth A\nassaulted staff.\" Staff Person 2 witnessed the altercation. Youth A was upset due to\nthe incident and left the facility and has since returned to the facility.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite with DHHS worker on 03/15/2021. He presented as\noppositional noting that he does not know when he was placed and that his\nplacement to date has been “alright”. He reports AWOL-ing with another youth\neither Friday or Saturday indicating they were out all night and throughout the next\nday in which nothing happened prior. He reports a few days prior that Staff Person 1\nwas sitting on the bench inside the cottage and that he was kicking his shoes at the\nstaff desk. Youth A reports Staff Person 1 instructed to go to his bedroom or to sit\non the bench, and that he also told him Staff Person 1 would “(expletive) him up, call\n2",
    "the cops, and say he (Staff Person 1) was assaulted by his shoes”. Youth A reports\nStaff Person 1 then choked him because he said Youth A had his phone, at which\nYouth A reports he went AWOL. Youth A reports informing Staff Person 3 and 4 of\nthe incident and that the police were then contacted. Youth A reports the other\nresidents were in their bedrooms and did not see the incident and that Staff Person\n2 “went along with it”. He reports this being the first incident involving Staff Person 1\nnoting that he just walked around downtown when he AWOL’d and that staff did not\nfollow him.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 onsite with DHHS worker on 04/15/2021. He reports\nbeing employed with the facility for three months with no disciplinary issues and has\ntaken verbal de-escalation training noting that the facility does not restrain residents.\nHe reports all other residents being in their bedrooms and that Youth A did not want\nto go to bed. He reports Youth A being verbally aggravated toward staff and that he\nused calming statements to Youth A. Staff Person 1 reports Youth A threw a shoe\nand hitting him in the head. He then states walking toward Youth A and giving him\nhis shoe back, in which Youth A pushed him. He reports informing Youth A that\nthrowing the shoe and pushing him is considered assault which Youth A stated that\nit did not before running out of the cottage. Staff Person 1 denies choking and\ntouching Youth A. Staff Person 1 reports Youth A and another peer returned from\nAWOL the day prior to the incident and that Youth A was upset that the other peer\nwas removed from the facility.\nI reviewed DHHS worker email summary of her interview with Staff Person 2 dated\n03/10/2021. A summary of her interview with Staff Person 2 is as follows:\nIt was shower time and Youth A was refusing and using profanity to staff\nand was asked to shower or go to his bedroom as he could not be near\nthe shower area while others were inside. Youth A was verbally\naggressive while sitting at the staff desk and threw a towel at Staff Person\n2 which he ignored. Youth A then threw his house-shoe at Staff Person 1\nhitting him in the head, which Staff Person 1 exclaimed, “You just\nassaulted me, and I didn’t do anything but told you to go to your room”.\nYouth A then attempted to take off his other shoe to assault Staff Person 1\nin which indicated that he could call the police. Youth A then pushed Staff\nPerson 1 and then walked out of the cottage. Youth A then threw a log\nthrough the window, walked inside the cottage, and then exited. An\nincident report was completed and that the police were not called until the\nnext day when Youth A returned to the facility. Staff Person 1 did come\nto grab the other show from Youth A and denied Staff Person 1 choking\nYouth 1 and states Youth 1 stating “You can’t touch me” and that Staff\nPerson 1 gave back Youth A his house-shoe. Staff Person 2 states he\nwas present during the entire incident and that no residents observed as\nthey were showering.\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff Person 3 onsite with DHHS worker dated 03/15/2021. She\nreports the next day of Youth A returning from AWOL that Youth A informed her of\nthe allegations. She reports Youth A indicated that Staff Person 1 informed him that\nit was alright to sit in the vestibule and that he was then instructed to go to his\nbedroom. Staff Person 1 then questioned Youth A where his phone was at and\nasked Youth A and then proceeded to choke him stating that Staff Person 1 would\nclaim that he was assaulted by Youth A. She reports Youth A denied any pain or\ninjuries.\nI reviewed incident report dated 03/11/2021 for incident on 03/10/2021. It states\nYouth A refusing to go to bedroom, swearing at staff, attempting to take phone, and\nthrowing shoe and pushing staff.\nI reviewed incident report dated 03/12/2021. It states Youth A AWOL-ing with\nanother youth after the group returning from playing basketball.\nI reviewed incident report dated 03/12/2021. It states Youth A AWOL-ing by breaking\nout his bedroom window. Youth A was found in the community and refused to return\nto the facility and went out of the line of sight of staff. After filing a police report and\nreturn to the facility that staff observed Youth A walking back to the cottage and\nproceeded to break other windows of the cottage before entering and going to bed.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe discipline,\nincluding any of the following:\n(a) Any type of corporal punishment inflicted in any manner.\nANALYSIS: There is no conclusive evidence to indicate staff choked Youth\nA as he alleges. Youth A had a prior history of AWOL-ing from\nthe facility before AWOL-ing again in which Youth A threw a\nshoe and pushed staff before leaving.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n4",
