It was not clear from the\ncomplaint which one of the agency’s Independent Living (IL) homes this complaint\nreferred to. Additionally, Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) Worker\nX and I were investigating the Lakewood IL home and staff were available for the\nshift, food was in the home.\nOn 10/6/2021 I attempted to speak with the Complainant. A male person answered\nmy call. He reported he was not the Complainant; he did not make a complaint and\nhung up on me.\n3",
    "On 10/12/2021 I spoke with DHHS Permanency Collaboration Unit (PCU) Worker\nXX. He advised the agency has at least 20 youths in IL placement. Not all of these\nare in staffed homes. He indicated contact with a number of the youth POS\n(Purchase of Service) DHHS Monitors. A couple of them reported the youth reported\nsome staff have withheld checks for youths not doing chores or attending life skill\nclasses.\nOn 10/12/2021 I spoke with Chief Administrator A by telephone about the complaint.\nHe expressed concern that an investigation for this complaint was being investigated\nsince the complaint does not name a staff or specific IL home. He reported, they\nhave four (one of which only has one youth due to COVID) staffed IL homes, all on\nthe eastside of Detroit. Chief Administrator A denied the allegations. He reported\nthe following:\n There have not been a time staff have left the youths in an IL home\nunsupervised for 24-hours. Nor longer. The agency staffs the IL homes from\n3:30pm until 7:00am. There is an afternoon shift (3:30pm-11:00pm) and\nmidnight shift (11:00pm-7:00am).\n They purchase food on occasion, especially when a youth first enters the\nprogram; but youths are responsible for purchasing their own food.\n Clothing for a youth is not purchased, it’s not the agency’s responsibility. This\nis an IL program, it’s the youths’ responsibility to purchase clothing.\n Bed sheets, and toiletries are provided when a youth is first placed. Chief\nAdministrator A reported it’s not his assertion that they must provide bedding\nsupplies for the youth, but they do so initially. Thereafter the youth is\nresponsible for the washing an upkeep of the bedding and towels. If the\nyouth needs these items and can’t get them, it’s the youth’s responsibility to\nbring this to the agency’s attention, by addressing it with staff and the case\nmanager. Administrator A said they are constantly buying these items\nbecause the youths mess up the items or use them to sleep on the floor. The\nlatter done at the youths’ own choosing.\n He affirmed his prior reporting that a youth’s check can be temporarily held for\nnot attending life skill courses, but staff do not do that.\nOn 10/15/2021 I spoke with Program Manager B by telephone about this complaint.\nShe affirmed Chief Administrator A’s reporting and added the following:\n They don’t provide the youth food, but if the youth reports not having food, they\nwill provide food. They have a pantry at one of the IL houses and will bring food\nfrom that location to where the youth is located.\n They supply each youth sheets, towels, a comforter, and cleaning supplies when\nthe youth is first placed. The youth receive a “care package”. The agency also\nkeeps a linen closet of these items, so that if the youths needs these items, they\ncan assist the youth. The youths have been throwing these items away.\n4",
    "For this investigation I interviewed six youths: Youth 1 was interviewed by me by\ntelephone on 10/15/2021. Youth 2 was interviewed by me at one IL home; and Youth 3,\nYouth 4, and Youth 5 were interviewed by me onsite at another IL home. I interviewed\nYouth 6 who resides at yet a different IL home, by telephone on 10/18/2021.\nAll residents were asked the same general questions about the complaint issues.\n Youth 1 reported being at her current location by herself due to COVID.\nStaff check on her a couple of times a day. When she was in the IL mom\nand child home, it was staffed daily. There was never a time staff did not\nwork at the facility. She has a bridge card, but the agency bought her\ngrocery when she first arrived and didn’t ask for her bridge card. She\nreported before she got sick and came to this current home on 10/5/2021\nshe knew she was to buy her own food, clothing, and toiletries. She had\nsheets when she arrived in the IL program. She was provided a comforter,\ntowels, and soap. Program Manager B and Youth Advocate Supervisor\nAssistant(YASA) G provided her with the former items, clothing detergent\nand everything she needed. Youth 1 reported receiving a stipend check\nevery two weeks. She uses it to pay her rent. It is never withheld.\n Youth 2, Youth 3, Youth 4, Youth 5, and Youth 6 reported being in the\nprogram for a year, four months, two months, four months, and seven\nmonths respectively. Youth 3 and Youth 5 have resided at other IL homes\nof this agency’s and relocated due to reason they reported not being clear\nabout. Youth 3 reported this being his second stay at this IL home. All of\nthese youths denied there being a time that staff left them unsupervised\nfor days or weeks without food. A couple of these youths varied with\nrespects to when staff arrive (3:30pm or 5:30pm) for their shifts, but all\nadmitted staff are normally onsite from the afternoon until 7:00am. Youth\n2 reported Program Manager B also checks on them regularly.\nEach of these youths affirmed Youth 1 and other staff reporting that they\nare responsible for their own food, clothing, and personal items. Aside\nfrom one of these youth complaining of the type of emergency food\nprovided, all admitted such assistance exits. In terms of stipend checks\nthey also affirmed receiving the funds every two weeks. Aside from a\ncouple of them reporting $147 is not enough, they reported the checks\nbeing timely. All reported a check can be held one-two days for not doing\nchores, curfew violations or not participating in life skills, but either\nreported their checks being withheld. Youth 2 reported he follows the\nrules. The other youths reported the IL contract rules were explained to\nthem.\nEach of these five youths were aware that the agency provides bedding\nitems to residents. Youth 3 and Youth 6 said they came with their own\n5",
    "sheets. Youth 6 also reported fresh sheets are provided at first\nplacement. Youth 5 said there were sheets on his bed, but they were not\nclean. Youth 5 reported the staff told him they would wash them, but he\nended up washing them himself.\nFive staff were interviewed. They reported similarly information as Chief Administrator\nA and Program Manager B related to the complaint issues:\n Case Manager C was interviewed by me via telephone on 10/15/2021 and\n10/20/2021. She reported all the youths have bridge cards, but if a youth reports\nthey have run out of food the agency will assist the youth with food. She also\nreported the agency has an emergency pantry and freeze with food located at\ntheir Joanne IL home. A staff will obtain food from there and take to the resident,\nif informed by the youth that the youth needs food. Case Manager C reported\nboth Youth 2 and Youth 4 have advised staff of such in the past, and the agency\nprovided them food. With respect to household items, like sheets, towels or\ncomforters, the exact item they provide depends on what the youth has at\nplacement. After that the youth is on his or her own to purchase more of those\nitems.\nCase Manager C reported no awareness of a time that staff have not reported for\na shift and the youths were along when an afternoon and midnight shift was to be\ncovered, which is always. Case Manager C denied youth checks being withheld.\nShe said that is a constant complaint by the youths, but it’s not true. She\nconfirmed that the youths’ stipend checks arrive every two weeks. She said, they\nnow have the youths to sign a document showing the youth received their check.\nShe provided me some of such related to youths on her caseload.\n Staff D was interviewed onsite by me on 10/15/2021 at the Lakewood IL House.\nHe reported, the same related to food, bedding hygiene items being provided\ninitially, and after the youth being on their own. He reported his shift started at\n3:00pm. Another staff will relieve him at 11:00pm and work until 7:00am. These\nare the shifts where the youths are supervised. After 7:00pm the youths are on\ntheir own and should be in school.\nDuring my onsite visit at the Lakewood IL address, the staff gave me a tour. I\nviewed and I checked the kitchen for both the upstairs and downstairs. Food\nconsisting of eggs, meat, cold cuts, milk, cereal, fruits, noodles, Rice Roni, and\nsome can goods, were observed appropriately in the refrigerator and or cabinets.\nStaff D reported the youths purchased the food out of the youths’ stipends.\nYouth 2 showed me his bedroom and linen was observed on his bed and he had\nclothing and other items scattered about in the room.\n6",
    " Staff E was interviewed onsite by me on 10/15/2021 at the Balfour IL House. She\nsaid staff are to be onsite 15 minutes before their shift is to start. She said,\nProgram Manager B is good at making sure a staff is at the IL home. Staff E\nreported the same general information as her coworkers related to issues of the\nallegations.\nDuring my onsite visit at the Balfour IL address, the staff gave me a tour of the\nyouth’s bedroom, the kitchen, refrigerator, cabinets, and the basement. Bedding\nwas seen on the beds. Foods, such as meats (hamburger, chicken, hot dogs),\nfruit, milk, waffles, pop, chips, spaghetti, Rice-Roni, Chef-Boy-R-D, can string\nbeans and corn, cake mix, flour and condiments were observed in the home.\n Case Manager F was interviewed by me by telephone on 10/27/2021. She\nreported when a youth first arrived at the program the staff will take the youth to\nbuy food until the youth’s bridge card case is opened. She reported that process\ncan takes 45-days and so the agency continues to buy food until the youth gets\ntheir bridge card. She confirmed Case Manager C’s and the two administrators’\nreporting on the other items. She added that youths do have chores and life\nskills courses they are required to complete to be compliant in the program. A\nyouth’s check can be set aside for a day or two for the youth to complete those\nitems; and that’s in the youth’s contract. However, they understand the youth\nneeds their funds to buy things, so checks are not withheld.\n Youth Advocate Supervisor Assistant (YASA) G confirms basically all aspects as\nreported by others. She reported the only window of time the youths are not\nsupervised is when they are in school from 8:00am- 3:00 pm. She reported a\nstaff person will report for the first supervisory shift at 3:00pm. She advised it’s\ntrue that some staff may work from 3:00pm- 11:00pm; and others 5:30pm to\n11:00pm. There is never a time a staff is not onsite at 3:00pm, unless that staff is\nlate or not able to come. If that’s the case, the staff person contacts the\nsupervisor or administrator. YASA G or someone else will fill in until the next\nscheduled staff person arrives onsite.\nYASA G reported similar information as Case Manager F with respect to youth\nchecks. She added, the case managers, not she, are responsible for handling\nthese stipend issues.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12505 Supervision.\n(1) An agency shall provide supervision for a youth in\nindependent living consistent with the youth's need for\nsupervision, as required by R 400.12504(2)(e).\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: The evidence does not support the allegations. The youths are\nreceiving regular supervision.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR400.12510 Independent living contract.\n(1) There shall be a mutually agreed upon contract between the\nyouth and the agency specifying all of the following:\n(a) The responsibilities of the agency and the youth.\nANALYSIS: The evidence does not support the allegations. The agency\nassists the youths with needed items.\nThe youths receive initial groceries, bedding, and hygiene items\nupon first placement into the program and food until their bridge\ncard and stipend account is opened. If the youth runs out of\nfood, emergency food is available and provided.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nOn an unknown date, several staff members yelled, cursed, and threatened to throw\nyouth around and treat them like a girl.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 10/12/2021 I spoke with Chief Administrator A by telephone about the complaint.\nI spoke with Program Manager B about the complaint by telephone on 10/15/2021.\nBoth the Chief Administrator A and Program Manager B reported no awareness of\nany youth being cursed, threatened, or called out of their name. No youth or staff\nhas reported such to them. Program Manager B reported when a youth enters their\nprograms, they advise the youth they are to be treated with dignity and respect; and\nfor them to report concerns related to staff misconduct.\nSix youths were interviewed by me related to this complaint: Youth 1 was\ninterviewed by me by telephone on 10/15/2021. Youth 2 was interviewed by me\nonsite at one IL home; and Youth 3, Youth 4, and Youth 5 were interviewed by me\nonsite at a different IL home. I interviewed Youth 6 who resides at yet another IL\nhome by telephone on 10/18/2021.\n Youth 1 reported staff treats her with dignity and respect. She said, she was\nnot in any of the staff’s faces. She has a good relationship with her case\n8",
    "manager and Program Manager B. In the short time she has been in the\nprogram, she has not observed or heard of any resident being cursed or\nthreatened. She admitted she has not been around other IL residents much\ndue to getting sick and needing to transfer to her current setting.\n Youth 2, Youth 4, and Youth 6 also reported feeling safe and treated with\nrespect. They denied any staff cursing or threatening them. Nor were they\naware of any other residents experiencing such.\n Youth 5 reported arguing with a staff and the staff yelling and threatening\nhim, but no other youth witnessed it. He and that staff are good now. Youth\n5 also reported there was a time Staff H did not let him in the house, because\nhe was sitting on the porch after curfew. Youth 3 and YASA G were reported\nto have information related to this.\n Youth 3 reported this was Youth 5’s fault and Youth 5 was let inside\nthe home after YASA G arrived.\n YASA G confirmed Youth 3’s reporting. She said Staff H contacted her\nrelated to Youth 5 going on the porch then leaving after curfew; and\nStaff H locked the door after Youth 5 left. YASA G reported it is\nagency policy that if a youth arrived back at the facility after curfew,\nthe youth needs a police escort or pass to be allowed back. However,\nin this incident Youth 5 didn’t actual leave the facility. Youth 5 reported\nhe went for a smoke. The matter was worked out quickly and Youth 5\nwas allowed back into the home.\n Youth 3 reported, he has anger issues, but keeps it under control and\nprofessional, but staff yell and curse at them. He reported Case Manager C\ndid such to him in July 2021. Case Manager C threatened to throw him like a\ngirl, due to him being transgender. Youth 3 reported he was listening to\nmusic and Case Manager C told him to clean his room. Case Manager C\nentered his room and began throwing his clothing. He began videotaping her\nbecause the administrator told them if staff do inappropriate things show\nthem with proof. He and Case Manager C were talking back, and forth and\nCase Manager C told him to shut up and put her finger in his face. He told\nCase Manager C to shut up and Case Manager C said she was an adult and\ndid not have too, and that she was not worried about him.\nFive staff members were interviewed by me related to this complaint issue. Case\nManager C was interviewed by telephone on 10/15/2021, and 10/20/2021 Staff D,\nand Staff E were interviewed onsite at different IL homes on 10/15/2021. Case\nManager E and YASA G were interviewed, separately by telephone on 10/27/2021.\n All the staff interviewed denied that any youth has complained or reported\nto them that they were cursed, threatened by a staff member, or told a\nstaff would throw them around like a girl.\n9",
    " Staff D, Staff E, Case Manager F, as well as Case Manager C all denied\ndoing such to any youth.\n Case Manager F acknowledged residents were advised to video tape\nconcerns of maltreatment. However, she denied awareness of any video\nshowing staff misconduct. Case Manager F reported no resident has\nreported maltreatment by staff.

I visited this home after 5:00pm:\n10",
    " Youth 3-bedroom door being broken off the hinges at the top. Youth 3 denied\nhim or someone else breaking the door. He reported there were always issues\nwith the door. He said the door has been like that for over a week. The more he\nopened and closed the door the worst it got with the nail coming unscrewed. He\nexpressed privacy concerns due to the door issue.\n A very large hole in the wall upstairs going to the bedroom. Additionally various\nsmaller holes in the walls of the upper bedroom. All of which did not appears to\nbe recent. Staff E, Youth 3, Youth 4, and Youth 5 denied knowing how long the\nwall damage had exited or how it happened. Youth 3 reported the big hole was\nthere when he arrived. He said it’s likely been there for a month because of\nanother youth living there and reporting a concern. Youth 3 admitted there have\nbeen things broken by residents due to fights, like the tv. He denied youths\nfighting and damaging the walls.\nProgram Manager B reported the damages did not exit prior to my visit to the\nhome on 10/15/2021. She reported being at the home around 2:15pm on\n10/15/2021 and the holes were not there. She said the three youths at this home\nmoved in two weeks ago; and the home was in good repair. She reported seeing\nthe one hole later and agreed it looked as if a person could fit in the hole. She\nprovided me a picture of a large wall hole, which was not the hole I had\nreferenced. She reported later that the picture she provided me was a new hole\nin the living in room which happened since my visit. This was just to show how\nthat too had just happened Program Manager B reported the residents wrestle,\nand this may be how the damage occurred. She said the residents break and\ndamage things and they repair them. She reports the repairs have been made to\nthese issues. She reported when damages occur, and the staff or resident\nreports them and they have maintenance to make repairs quickly.\nCase Manager F reported most of the residents at the Balfour address are on her\ncase load. She reported visiting the home recently (no specific day given). She\ndid not recall seeing holes in the walls, nor a wet, dirty basement with hanging\nwires.\nYASA G reported doing a walkthrough of this house on 10/14/2021; and that the\nholes were not there. She said and other staff concluded Youth 3 and Youth 4\nwho are large youths horseplay, and their behavior caused the damage.\n Extremely dirty and wet basement with hanging wires. Staff E and the youths\nresiding at this site reported they did not know how long the basement has been\nin its current condition. YASA G reported the sink in the kitchen was leaking and\nthat’s where the water/wet basement floor was from.\n11",
    "Program manager B and YASA G reported all the things have been fixed. On\n12/8/2021, Program Manager B provided me a picture of a basement area which\nshowed the laundry tub and floor. That small area appeared clean and dry.\nHowever, the picture was not of the entire basement area and did not show the\nbasement ceiling area, so as to reveal that no wires were hanging.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12505 Supervision.\n(2) An agency shall provide the following minimum\nsupervision.\n(b) At monthly interval, ensure that the youth is complying\nwith the terms of the contract required by R400.1210,\ncontinues to resident in a safe and acceptable environment,\nand it is managing expenditures.\nANALYSIS: The agency’s Balfour IL home showed holes in the walls, a\nbedroom door broken from it hinges, creating a privacy issue;\nand a dirty, wet basement with wires hanging from the ceiling.\nAll of these are possible safety issues and do not comply with\nthis rule related to acceptable and safe environment.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV.
