The Chief Administrator reported there\nwas no evidence the biological son of Relative 1, who is listed on\nthe sexual offender registry, was residing in the home of Relative\n1 where foster children reside. The foster children are the\nbiological children of Relative 1’s son, hereafter referred to as\nBiological Father. The Chief Administrator reported Biological\nFather is homeless and has listed his address as the address of\nRelative 1. The Chief Administrator referred me to the Licensing\nSupervisor and Staff 1 for further information.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 06/14/2024 and 07/17/2024 via\ntelephone. Staff 1 is the licensing worker for the agency. Staff 1\nreported she has interviewed all children residing in the home of\nRelative 1 and the children denied that their Biological Father has\nresided in the home with them. Staff 1 reported she initiated\nspecial evaluation #2024SEC0001620 on 05/20/2024 to address\nthe allegation the Biological Father was residing in Relative 1’s\nhome. Staff 1 reported the evaluation is still open and thus far\nthere is no evidence the Biological Father is residing in the home\nof Relative 1.\nDuring the interview on 07/17/2024 Staff 1 reported she had\ncompleted the DHS-3130 home study for Relative 1 on\n01/30/2024 and at the time she did not know of the concern\nBiological Father may have been residing in the home of Relative\n1. Staff 1 reported she was unaware Biological Father was listed\n2",
    "as a sexual offender and therefore the home study did not\naddress this concern.\nStaff 1 reported she was aware of a DHS-3130-A that was\ncompleted on 02/22/2024 for Relative 1. Staff 1 reported this\nhome study was completed by the foster care worker for the home\nwho no longer is employed by the agency.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 06/17/2024 via telephone. Staff 2 is\nthe foster care worker for Relative 1’s home and the children on\nthe case. Staff 2 reported there is no evidence Biological Father\nhas been residing in the home.

Staff 2\nfurther reported Relative 1 has not reported that Biological Father\nhas or is residing in the home.\nRelative 1 was interviewed via telephone on 07/03/2024.\nRelative 1 denied that Biological Father, had been residing in the\nhome. Relative 1 reported Biological Father “couch surfs” living\nhere and there with no fixed address.\nFoster Youth A was interviewed via telephone on 07/03/2024.\nFoster Youth A. Foster Youth A denied Biological Father lives in\nthe home of Relative 1 where he himself resides. Foster Youth A\nreports he feels safe living in Relative 1’s home.\nThe Licensing Supervisor was interviewed via telephone on\n07/17/2024. The Licensing Supervisor acknowledged the agency\ndid have information prior to the home study being completed as\nthe Biological Father’s address was listed as the address of\nRelative 1. The Licensing Supervisor reported she missed this\ninformation in CWLM. The “PSOR” public offender registration,\nindicated Biological Father’s address is the same as Relative 1.\nThe Licensing Supervisor acknowledged this information was\noverlooked therefore the home study did not address the concern.\nBiological Father’s whereabouts are unknown and thus, was\nunable to be interviewed.\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEW:\n• Review in CWLM of Relative 1’s file (unlicensed\nrelative). The file documents that DCWL Analyst in Lansing\nidentified on 11/15/2023 the Biological Fathers address\nwas listed as the address of Relative 1. This information\nwas obtained from the PSOR document. The box is\n3",
    "checked for “address” indicating the Biological Father is\nliving at Relative 1’s home.\n• Relative 1’s Initial Home Study was completed on\n11/16/2023. The home study, (DHS-3130) was reviewed.\nThe Home study does not address the concern Biological\nFather may be living in the home of Relative 1.\n• A DHS-3130-A home study dated 02/22/2024 was\nreviewed. The home study does not address that the\nPSOR indicated the Biological Father’s address is the\nsame as Relative 1.\n• Social Work Contacts were reviewed. A social work\ncontact dated 02/16/2024, written by Staff 2, documents an\nFTM was conducted on this date. The contact states both,\nthe Biological Mother and Biological Father have been\nliving in the home, but does not clearly identify the home of\nRelative 1. The contact further states the parents living in\nthe home are not permitted. The contact proceeds with a\nsafety plan prohibiting the Biological Father from living in\nthe home or staying overnight in the home of Relative 1.\n• PSOR Document: The document was reviewed and\nidentifies the Biological Father as a registered sex offender\nwhose address is the same as Relative 1.\nAnalysis A sexual offender registry check conducted on 11/15/2023 by a\nDCWL Analyst in Lansing identified that The Biological Father’s\naddress is the same as Relative 1. The PSOR was uploaded into\nthe CWLM system on the same date. The agency failed to identify\nthis information during the process of licensing the home. The\nDHS-3130 did not address the PSOR finding.\nThe DHS 3130-A also did not address the concern noted on the\nPSOR. The FTM on 02/16/2023 noted that the Biological Father\nmay have been living in the home and a safety plan was initiated.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
