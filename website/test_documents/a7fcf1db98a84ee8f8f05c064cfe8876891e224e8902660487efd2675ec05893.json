    "Chief Administrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on June 13,\n2022 and interviewed via telephone on June 21, 2022. When allegations were\nreviewed with Chief Administrator, he reported Youth A is on a one-to-one status\nwhen he needs the extra support and when staffing allows it. Chief Administrator\nreported Youth A has been attending school off campus and not at Wedgwood but\nrecently the school year ended for summer vacation. Chief Administrator reported he\nhas put a hold on accepting new admissions onto this unit because they want to\nmake sure they remain in ratio. He reported he has not heard of any concerns of the\nunit being out of ratio. During a phone interview on June 21, 2022, it was discussed\nabout the ratio issue on May 28, 2022. It was found the home had 5 youth at\nnighttime and 1 staff member present where there should have been 2 staff\nmembers. Chief Administrator reported the staff member that was scheduled called\noff work at 10:30pm and due to the holiday weekend, it was a struggle to find\nanother staff member. It was reported that due to that late call off the staff member\nwas given disciplinary action. Chief Administered reported the facility has been\nputting new plans in place for what to do if this was to happen again. He reported\nrecently the facility has implemented a meeting every Thursday with each home\nsupervisor across the agency to review scheduling and how to support one another.\nThis has been helpful to make sure coverage is taken care of at each home and the\nsupervisors are aware of what the needs are at each unit.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on June 13, 2022. Youth A\nwas working with Supervisor 1 when this consultant arrived. Youth A has limited\nverbal skills and was able to say hi to this worker and note that he was happy.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on June 13, 2022.\nSupervisor 1 reported currently there are 7 youth residing on the unit. They have a\nratio on 1 staff for every 2 youth during waking hours. Supervisor 1 reported the\nschedule 4 staff during waking hours, so they stay within ratio and meet the needs of\nYouth A’s one-to-one when needed. Supervisor 1 reported staffing has been difficult,\nbut it has been getting better as months go on. He reported overnights is sometimes\nwhere they have the difficulty to make sure they have the two staff for ratio.\nSupervisor 1 reported the unit is currently not taking any new admissions to make\nsure they stay within ratio. Supervisor 1 reported when there is an open spot within\nthe schedule, they will pass that long to part time workers and on call workers. If no\none is able to pick up the shift, then himself or Supervisor 2 will pick up the shift.\nSupervisor 1 reported he has a weekly meeting with other unit supervisors to talk\nabout their staffing schedules and behaviors on the units to see where support is\nneeded. He reported this has been extremely helpful when it comes to making sure\neveryone is fully staffed. When asked if the unit has been out of ratio in the past\nmonth, supervisor one reported he does not believe so. Supervisor 1 reported there\nmay have been on third shift over the holiday weekend when there was only one\nstaff member because the other third shift staff member called off minutes before\nthey were supposed to come in. He reported they attempted to fill the shift, but also\n3",
    "other units were struggling with staffing and there was no coverage found. The on-\ncall supervisor was already covering for another unit.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on June 13, 2022.\nSupervisor 2 reported Youth A is supposed to have a one-to-one staffing during\nwaking hours and when he is not in school. She reported this is also on an as\nneeded basis. Typically, they will add in a one-to-one staffing for Youth A when they\nhave a new admission since Youth A’s behaviors increase when there is a change to\nthe unit. Supervisor 2 reported this is Youth A’s first week of summer vacation.\nSupervisor 2 reported the ratio on the unit is one staff for every two youth. She\nreported she works with Supervisor 1 on creating the weekly schedule and has four\nstaff scheduled during the day and two staff scheduled at over nights. Supervisor 2\nreported staffing has been a struggle with the pandemic. She reported she does\nweekly supervision with her staff to do a check in and focuses on how their self-care\nplan is going. She reported she has three full time overnight workers to help\nmaintain the ratio. Supervisor 2 reported sometimes they cannot maintain ratio\nbecause they help support other units when there is a crisis. She reported that when\nstaff are unable to fill in the open shifts on the schedule that herself or Supervisor 1\nwill take on an extra shift. She reported someone called off this morning and she\npicked up the shift so that they could be in ratio.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on June 13, 2022. Staff 1\nreported she has just come back from medical leave on May 16, 2022. She reported\nthat she has been working both morning and evening shifts. Staff 1 reported there\nhas been a staffing shortage all around the facility and the supervisors do what they\ncan to fill the spots. She reported the unit typically runs with four staff working during\nwaking hours unless the kids are in off ground school then it less. She reported\nsometimes a staff member will call off last minute and the supervisors try to find\nsomeone to fill in the spot. Staff 1 reported the unit has had only three staff working\na shift once but could not remember the amount of youth living on the unit at the\ntime. Staff 1 believed they were in ratio at the time. She reported this morning\nsomeone called off and Supervisor 2 filled in to maintain ratio.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n VanderArk Program Statement- The program statement for the facility reports\nthe day time staffing ratio is one staff member to every two youth and the\nnighttime staffing ratio is one staff member to every four youth.\n Contract between Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and\nWest License- The contract states the contractor must maintain a minimum of\none on-duty direct care worker for every two youth during wake hours. The\ncontractor must maintain a minimum of one-duty direct care worker for every four\nyouth during sleeping hours.\n Staff scheduled for week of 05/29/2022-06/18/2022: The schedule notes there\nwere six shifts noting the person who was scheduled to work was out sick.\n4",
    "Meaning there was only three staff working on the shift with the youth. There\nwere notes of coverage for each shift.\n VanderArk Daily Census for 05/16/22-06/16/22: The daily census notes the\ndaily number of youths residing on the unit during the day and night. There are\nnotes within the census that documents when a youth is on an overnight home\npass. The range of youth being on shift was 4-7 youth at a time.\n VanderArk Timesheet for third shift employees for 05/16/22-06/16/22- The\ntime sheets show that all shifts were covered during waking hours for the youth\nto maintain appropriate ratio. There was one third shift on 05/22/2022 where\nthere were 5 youth residing on the unit and 1 staff working.\n Youth A MiSACWIS Approved Placement Exception Request (PER) - The\nPER notes the youth is approved for one-to-one supervision at West Campus for\nthe period of time from 04/12/22-07/10/22 for up to 12 hours per day based on\nthe need at the facility.\n 1:1 Weekly Tracking Sheet for Youth A dated 5/31/2022-06/12/2022- Youth A\nreceived one to one supervision on 05/31/22, 06/03/22, 06/04/22,\n06/07/22,06/8/22, 06/9/22,06/10/22, 06/11/22, 06/12/22. The days one to one\nsupervision was not provided was 06/01/22, 06/02/22, 06/05/22, 06/06/22.\n Email from Youth A’s foster care worker dated 6/13/2022- Youth A’s foster\ncare worker reported, “It (one-to-one staffing) is based on Youth A’s needs.\nSpecifically, he struggles with change in schedule and transitioning from one\nactivity to another. In the summer his schedule variates more frequently with\ntrips, outings, and field trips much more that during school. This is sometimes\ndifficult requiring the 1:1. I have had no concerns with staff at Wedgwood. They\ncommunicate often and have always been available when I drop by for an\nunannounced visit. Both the office staff and direct staff work together for me to\nhave my private meeting with Youth A and to view his room.”\n Youth B MiSACWIS Approved Placement Exception Request (PER) - The\nPER notes the youth is approved for one-to-one supervision at West Campus for\nthe period of time from 02/22/22-05/22/22 for up to 12 hours per day based on\nthe need at the facility. The PER request for 05/23/2022-08/2022 does not\nrequest continuation of one-to-one supervision. The one-to-one supervision\nended on 05/23/22.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility was found in violation due to having one third shift\nwhere the unit was out of ratio over the past month.\nConsultantion:\nIt is recommended for the home supervisors to continue their\nThursday meetings and to talk about what to do when a staff\nmember calls off for third shift at the time they are supposed to\nbe at work. It is recommended for the facility to follow the plans\nthey have set in place with hiring a third shift floater to help\nsupport the units on campus in needs. It is recommended for\nhome supervisors to be aware to call upper leadership for\nsupport when staffing is out of ratio to make sure coverage can\nbe secured.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend no change to the\nlicense status of this child caring institution.\nJune 28, 2022\n________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 1, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
