    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12507\nSection Medical, dental and mental health care\nDescription • (1) An agency shall ensure that a youth in independent\nliving receives any needed medical, dental, and mental\nhealth care as required in R 400.12413. Medical, dental,\nand mental health care provided must be documented in\nthe youth’s record.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A has been asking to go to the hospital for 2 weeks. Youth\nA was at the hospital 2 weeks ago and diagnosed with a Urinary\nTract Infection (UTI). Youth A had a bad reaction to the\nmedication that were given. The facility is understaffed and unable\nto take Youth A to the hospital.\nInvestigation Youth A, age 17, was interviewed on 6/20/2025 via telephone.\nShe repeated the same information as the allegation. Youth A\nreported she went to the hospital in May of 2025, and could not\nremember the exact date but stated she had an infection. Upon\ngoing to the hospital, she learned she had a urinary tract infection\n(UTI). She was prescribed the medications, phenazopyridine\n200mg to take for three days and sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim\nevery twelve hours for five days. Youth A reported she needed to\ngo to the hospital because she googled the medications she was\ntaking and discovered she was allergic to the medications due to\nitching on parts of her body, legs and back and she was in pain.\nShe reported this was a side effect for the phenazopyridine she\nwas taking. She reported she needed to go to urgent care, but\nstaff told her she had to wait because other youths had dental\nappointments, and their appointments were scheduled ahead of\nher request. Youth A reported she did not like this decision and\nfelt her request was more urgent. Youth A reported she was told\nby Program Manager to stop taking the medications and she\nwould be transported to the doctor the next day. She reported she\nstopped taking the medication and she was not taken to the doctor\nthe next day. Youth A said the pain went away and the infection\nwent away on its own. Youth A reported she would have went to\nthe doctor on her own but that she needed a staff person with her\nbecause she could not sign to see the doctor on her own. She\nsaid an adult would have to accompany her because she was not\n18 at the time. Youth A reported she felt she had no support and\nat the time, felt unsafe. She reported she does not like the\n2",
    "program because every time she asks for something, she is told\nno. Youth A reported she is not feeling any pain now and she feels\nmuch safer. She reported no one in the program has ever\nthreatened her or had any physical contact towards her. Youth A\nreported all of her needs are being met.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed on 6/20/25 via\nTEAMS. She reported Youth A entered their program on 2/3/2025.\nShe reported that the Independent Living Program (ILP) is not\nresponsible for youths’ personal transportation. Staff will assess\nyouth familiarity with public transportation upon admission and\noffer assistance in learning how to use this form of transportation.\nShe reported that the agency will pay half of the cost of a city or\nregional bus card. She said there are occasions that staff will\nprovide transportation assistance, at the discretion of the agency.\nHowever, all youth under the age of 18 will be transported to their\ndoctor’s appointment because adult supervision is required to sign\nfor the youth. CA said this is in the youth handbook and Youth A is\naware of this statement. CA reported the agency is not\nunderstaffed and have provided Youth A to several medical\nappointments. CA reported the agency has twelve staff members\nworking in this program and the staff covers all three shifts. She\nreported the agency goes beyond the contract requirements of\n3PM – 7PM for staff. She said Youth A wants what she wants\nimmediately, or she becomes upset. CA reported Youth A breaks\ncurfew often and goes against the agency policies. CA reported\nstaff did take Youth A to the doctor on 5/27/2025, and Youth A\nhad a UTI. CA reported the reason Youth A wanted to go to the\ndoctor’s again in June 2025 was to find out if she was pregnant.\nCA reported that Youth A found out she was pregnant. CA\nreported life skills are offered to Youth A, and this is the part of the\nprogram where independence is taught to all of the youths in the\nprogram. She reported Youth A does not attend and has refused\nto participate in services offered to her within the program. CA\nreported Youth A never complained to her about an allergic\nreaction from taking her prescribed medications. She said PM and\nFCW would address concerns of this nature.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed on 6/20/2025, via\nTEAM. PM reported Youth A was transported to the doctor on\n5/27/2025, by agency staff. She was given two medications to\ntake as she had a UTI. She reported the agency does offer\ntransportation assistance to the youth if a youth requests to go to\nthe doctor or urgent care, especially if they are under 18 years old\nbecause an adult has to accompany them. PM reported that Youth\nA never mentioned an allergic reaction to her from taking the\n3",
    "medications prescribed. PM reported Youth A requested to go to\nthe doctor again on 6/17/2025 stating she was allergic to the\nmedication and had started itching and was in pain. PM reported\nYouth A never reported what type of pain she was having, but she\nwas transported to the doctor by agency staff on 6/17/2025, when\nYouth A requested to go see a doctor. She reported the\nmedications Youth A was taking had already been used and the\nreason Youth A wanted to go to the doctor was to find out if she\nwas pregnant. PM reported Youth A was transported to the doctor\non 6/17/2025 and learned she was 7 weeks pregnant. PM\nreported Youth A does overact when she wants the staff to do\nthings for her immediately. PM reports Youth A is encouraged to\nparticipate in her needed medical and mental health needs. She\nreported Youth A’s response is to make threats towards the staff,\nthrow things around and Youth A can become explosive.\nPM reported Youth A could benefit from mental health services as\nshe is diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance\nof emotions and conduct as well as persistent depression\ndisorder. PM reported she believes Youth A’s unaddressed mental\nhealth concerns are a major factor contributing to her emotional\ninstability and defiant behavior. PM reported Youth A has\ndemonstrated frequent mood swings and difficulty regulating her\nemotions, which has compromised both her safety and the safety\nof others in the program.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via phone on\n8/15/2025. She reported in complying with the agency\nexpectations, a 30-day removal from the program has been\nsubmitted for Youth A. She reported this will be difficult for Youth\nA but Youth A’s behaviors are getting worst since she learned she\nis pregnant. FCW reported that Youth A never mentioned to her\nthat she had an allergic reaction from the UTI, nor did Youth A\nrequest to go to see a doctor for an allergic reaction from the\nprescribed medications.

She said she always\nreturns back to the agency around 4:00am or sometimes later.\nYouth A reported she catches the bus or gets rides from her\nfriends to get to her friend’s house. Youth A did not identify the\nfriends who give her a ride or pick her up.
