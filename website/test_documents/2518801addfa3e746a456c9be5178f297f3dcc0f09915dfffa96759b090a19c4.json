TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not offered technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nDuring the renewal period there were three special investigations.\n2017C0220013 4/11/17\nIt was reported to this consultant by the agency that a resident complained he was\nphysically managed in an aggressive manner. The resident admitted a history of\nrestraints for aggressive behavior toward staff and peers as well as not following\ndirections. This was confirmed by reviewing resident A.s history of seclusions and\nrestraints over the last twelve months. Staff reported that during snack on 3/11/17 the\nresident was acting in a hostile and threatening manner toward another resident. Staff\nmade the decision to restrain the resident to prevent him from assaulting another\nyouth. The restraint resulted in both the staff and resident falling to the floor. This\nconsultant determined the staff’s restraint was justified in order to avoid a probable\nassault by resident. There were no citations issued.\n2017CO220020 8/10/17\nThe complainant alleged that the resident did not receive mental services. It was\ndocumented between the detention record and medical record that the resident was\nevaluated by a psychiatrist who recommended medication changes. The mother\nrefused to sign a consent for the medications. The psychiatrist removed the youth\n4",
    "from his rotation. The mother was provided with a referral to a community based\npsychiatrist for follow up services. The resident was assigned to a therapist at\nChildren’s Village. The complainant also alleged that the resident was in room with\nanother resident she often fought with. It was confirmed that the resident was placed\nin her own bedroom. The allegations were not substantiated. There were no citations\nissued.\n2017C0220022 9/6/17\nIt was alleged that a resident was intentionally injured during a restraint. This complaint\nwas jointly investigated with another DHHS unit. The resident told investigators that he\nreceived marks when staff banged his head on the cement slab in the behavior\nmanagement room. According to resident he was not resisting staff. The two staff that\nconducted the restraint and the one staff that witnessed the restraint stated the resident\nresisted the transport. Staff stated the escort to the behavior management room and the\nplacement in the room followed protocol. Staff stated the placement in the BMR in front\nof the cement was done quickly. Staff concluded the abrasions were the result of the\nyouth moving his head from side to side on the cement slab. This consultant and the\nother DHHS consultant found no evidence that staff intentionally injured the resident\nduring the escort or during the placement in the BMR. The allegations were not\nsubstantiated.\nInterim Inspection 4/19/17\nThere was an annual inspection completed on 4/19/17. This inspection found the\nagency compliant with all applicable licensing statutes and rules.\n5",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the facility be issued a renewal of their\nregular license.\n______________________________________3/13/18_\nJames B.
