Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nResident was dared to touch another resident's vagina during a game of truth or\ndare. There was no supervision when the incident happened.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 6/18/2020 I received a call from Administrator 1 to report that Residents C & D\nreported to Staff 2 that, during a game of Truth or Dare on 6/17/2020, Resident B\ntouched Resident A’s vagina. The staff reported that this took place between eye on\nchecks. Administrator 1 reported that Residents A & B have not been put on\nprecautions and have safety plans in place.\n2",
    "Interviews\nOn 6/22/2020 I made an unannounced visit to the facility and interviewed Staff 1, 2 3\nand 4, Residents A, B, C, and D, and Therapist 1. All 4 residents reported that they\nwere standing in the hallway playing Truth or Dare on 6/17/2020. All the residents\nreported that Resident C and Resident D kissed and that Resident B kissed\nResident A. Resident A also reported that Resident B touched her vagina, inside her\npants. The residents reported that the staff were not around at the time, but were\ncompleting checks on them, so they would play the game in between checks. The\nresidents reported that they went outside to have a snack and continue the game at\nwhich time Resident B touched Resident A’s butt and Residents C and D kissed\nagain.\nStaff 3 and 4 reported that on 6/17/2020 the 4 residents were in the hallway outside\nof Resident A’s room. Staff 3 stated that he was moving between the dining room,\nhallway, and staff office showing Staff 5 how to do various duties. Staff 3 reported\nthat typically two staff wouldn’t be in the office at the same time, but the laptop\nwasn’t working and Staff 3 had to show Staff 5 how to enter information into the\ncomputer system. Staff 4 stated he was in the tv room with another resident and\nwasn’t responsible for supervision of the other residents, but he stated that Staff 3\nand 5 should have remained in earshot of the residents in the hallway. Staff 3\nreported that the residents were never alone in the hallway for more than 2 minutes\nat a time. He stated that, when they moved outside, Staff 5 was watching them from\nthe dining room.\nTherapist 1 reported that she was not at the facility when the incident was reported,\nbut she called and spoke to the staff and residents involved. She reported that\nResident A does demonstrate some hypersexualized behavior, but she has never\nengaged in any sexual perpetration. Therapist 1 stated that Resident A is on\nincreased supervision status, no residents can congregate in doorways, and the\nresidents cannot be outside alone together.\nStaff 1 and 2 both reported that they were made aware of the incident the following\nday and that increased supervision of the residents has been implemented since.\nOn 7/7/2020 I interviewed Staff 5 and Staff 6 at the facility. Staff 6 reported that she\nwas Resident E’s 1:1 staff on 6/17/2020 so she was not responsible for supervising\nthe other residents, but she does recall seeing them in the hallway together. Staff 5\nstated that she was completing a training shift on 6/17/2020. She reported that she\nand Staff 3 were alternating doing checks. She stated that, she would go into the\nstaff office with Staff 3 to enter data into the computer for no more than 2 minutes at\na time. Otherwise, she was in the dining room keeping an eye on the residents in the\nhallway. She stated that the youth should always have been in line of sight and that\nit was unusual that they were left alone. She reported that when the residents went\noutside she watched them from the dining room window and would conduct checks\n“here and there,”\n3",
    "Documents\nOn 7/7/2020 I reviewed the facility’s supervision policy which states that staff are to\ncomplete eye on checks of residents at varying intervals no less that 15 minutes. I\nalso reviewed an Incident completed 6/18/2020 reporting that documented the\nresidents’ reports of the incident and the resident observation log documenting that\nStaff 3 and 5 were completing the checks on the residents at the time of the incident.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Residents were able to engage in sexual contact with one\nanother while they were congregated near a resident’s doorway\nand while outside during which time staff were not providing\ncontinual supervision of the residents.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nThis is a repeat violation cited in:\nSIR 2019C0112035 dated 8/2/2019, CAP approved 8/29/2019\nSIR 2019C0112033 dated 8/6/2019, CAP approved 8/29/2019\nIV.
