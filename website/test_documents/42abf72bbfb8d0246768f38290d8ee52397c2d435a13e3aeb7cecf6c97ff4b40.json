She is not\nfully aware of the agency policy regarding incidents involving\nyouth who are physically aggressive and/or destroying physical\nproperty.\nStaff 5 was interviewed on December 5, 2024, via telephone.\nThe agency policy is to call 911 when youth are escalated and not\nresponding to de-escalation attempts. They can attempt to\nmaintain separation if they are able to safely deescalate. They are\nnot to touch youth at all.\nAdministrator was interviewed on 12/10/2024 via telephone.\nShe stated the staff involved, Staff 1, was terminated within the\nlast week after an internal investigation was completed. She\nstated the program does not allow restraints. The agency does\nrecognize he was attempting to keep Youth A from hitting another\nstaff, but staff are not allowed to do a restraint.\nAdministrator was asked about agency policy regarding staff being\nallowed to intervene in certain circumstances. When staff were\ninterviewed, they reported concern because Staff 1 came out of\nnowhere and didn’t feel his approach was appropriate.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 12/16/2024 via telephone. He stated\nthe guidance given is safety first. They are to call law enforcement\nif there is destruction of property.\nStaff 1 was contacted but he did not respond.

    "Documents Reviewed:\n• Holy Cross Behavior Management Policy & Procedure,\neffective 11/1/2022.\nFederal/State regulation(s): Licensing Rules for Foster\nFamily Homes & Foster Family Group Homes (R\n400.9415).\nPolicy statement:\n“It is the policy of Holy Cross Services (HCS) that all\npersons served have the right to receive treatment services\nfree from the threat of physical management in which\nperson served are taken or held on the floor, chemical\nrestraint, seclusion, and any form of retaliatory punishment.\nHCS practices a restraint-free behavior management\nprogram throughout all program sites. However, we do\nrecognize that there may be extreme cases in which the\nuse of physical management techniques such as small child\nholds without undue force, emergency restraint\nEXCLUDING PRONE or escorting person served utilizing\narm support may be warranted. Such extreme cases of\nphysical management are conducted solely within the\ncontext of Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) as emergency\nintervention techniques and are limited to children or\nadolescents in danger of significant harm to self or others.\nIn most cases, emergency personnel will be contacted to\nintervene, should such intervention be warranted by the\nactions of a person served.”\nAnalysis The agency is found to be in noncompliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of agency policies and procedures the\nagency states persons served have the right to receive services\nfree from the threat of physical management. However, the\nfollowing paragraph in the HCS Behavior Management Policy &\nProcedure states “physical management techniques may be used\nin extreme circumstances and are conducted solely within the\ncontext of Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI).” Restraints are not\nappropriate procedures for independent living youth.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection • (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nDescription suitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\n3",

They are normally distributed on\nTuesdays. She indicated the checks are only distributed early\nwhen there are extenuating circumstances, and he would not be\nable to receive his early. Upon being told no, Youth A began\nflipping over tables and throwing items around. He began hitting\nthe lockers and at that point, another youth came out and told\nYouth A not to hit the lockers because his food is stored in there\nand told him to chill. They had back and forth dialogue. At that\npoint, Staff 5 came out of the office and got in front of Youth B and\nadvised him to back up. She clarified that she was facing Youth B\nand had her back toward Youth A. Staff 1 went behind her and\nwent to where Youth A was standing. Staff 2 came and was\nbehind Staff 5. She was pushing Youth B forward to get him out of\nthe area and she felt a hand hitting her on the left side of her\nchest. She turned around and it was Staff 1, Youth A and Staff 2\nbehind her.
