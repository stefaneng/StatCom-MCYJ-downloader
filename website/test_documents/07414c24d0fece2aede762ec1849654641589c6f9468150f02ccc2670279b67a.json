Additionally, AW instructed\nFoster Parent A to call in a complaint to centralized intake (CI) on\nhimself. AW failed to contact CI to report the allegations of child\nsexual abuse that was reported to her. She also failed to report\nthe information to her supervisor.\nInterviews:\nThe Complainant was interview via telephone on 2/8/23. During\nthe open DHHS Investigation it was discovered that Foster Parent\nA still had an open foster care license.

    "Parent A 3-4 years ago. On 1/10/23, she contacted Foster Parent\nA to ask him about another issue when he told her about the\nallegations his son made against him. She then called the DHHS\nWorker and DHHS Supervisor about the allegations and to find\nout why they never informed her of the allegations. During LW’s\nconversation with Foster Parent A, he mentioned that he told the\nAW and AW told him to report the allegations. LW contacted AW\nwho confirmed Foster Parent A told her about the allegations. LW\nstated they are taught to follow the protocol of reporting incidents\nof abuse/neglect. She said that protocol includes reporting the\nallegations to CI if the allegation does not come from CI, complete\nan incident report and let the supervisor know. LD is the\nSupervisor. LW believes an incident report was completed.\nThe Adoption Worker (AW) was interviewed via video\nconferencing on 2/22/23. She stated she is a Foster\nCare/Adoption Specialist and has done this job for 8-9 years. She\nreported Foster Parent A called her over the Christmas holiday\nand told her that his son was alleging he sexually abused him.\nFoster Parent A wanted to know what to do. AW told Foster\nParent A to see if Youth A would go stay with Foster Parent A's\nmother, have him see a doctor and to call in the allegations to CI.\nShe then went back to sleep and did not think of it again until LW\nasked her about it. AW stated she was at home sick when Foster\nParent A called. She said she knew if she had been well, she\nwould have contacted her supervisor, LD, to find out what to do.\nShe was not sure at the time what the protocol was for allegations\nlike this. She did complete an incident report once LW brought it\nup. She said she has since been told she should have called in a\ncomplaint to CI and called the agency simultaneously.\nLicensee Designee (LD) was interviewed by telephone on 2/22/23.\nLD reported she supervises LW and AW in her Foster\nCare/Adoption work. She was informed of allegations on 1/10/23\nfrom LW. She said she also found out AW knew about the\nallegations prior to them being brought up to LW and then talked\nto AW about it. AW apologized for not notifying anyone. LD\nreported any allegation of abuse/neglect is to be called into CI,\ndocumented in an incident report, let her know, and initiate a\nSpecial Evaluation. There is a checklist for foster care/adoption\nworkers to complete when they go to licensed homes. On the\nchecklist it indicates staff are to contact licensing if there are any\nissues in the home. She is not sure if AW was disciplined as she\nis not her direct supervisor. She also reported DHHS never\ncontacted them about their investigation which is something that\n3",
    "they usually get notification of. She trains staff on the child\nprotection law when they are hired and again every 3 - 4 months.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Provider File in MiSACWIS: There is an open Special\nEvaluation on Foster Parent A regarding the sexual abuse\nallegations. A social work contact from LW dated 1/10/23\nindicated she was informed of the allegations from Foster\nParent A. That same day LW talked to AW about the\nallegations.\n• AW Employee file: AW was hired on 11/19/12. She\nreceived a corrective action plan on 2/23/23 regarding this\nincident. She met with her supervisor and was advised on\nfollowing the agency’s reporting policy. AW had mandated\nReporter training on 5/20/21.\n• Compliance with Child Protection Law Policy: if a worker\nsuspects child abuse or neglect the worker shall\nimmediately contact CI. An incident report is to be\ncompleted and submitted to licensing. Any major concerns\nin foster homes must be reported to the supervisor.\n• Incident Report: An incident report written by AW was\nprovided. The report was not dated but it did indicate the\nsame information provided during AW’s interview.\nAnalysis The Adoption Worker admitted she did not report the allegation of\nsexual abuse as required by the agencies policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n3/4/23\n______________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n03/12/2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"

    "summary": "A Special Investigation Report for Homes for Black Children substantiated that an Adoption Worker (AW) failed to report allegations of sexual abuse. The AW was informed by the alleged perpetrator (a foster/adoptive parent) that a youth had accused him of sexual abuse, and she instructed the parent to call in the report himself but did not make the mandatory report to Centralized Intake or notify her supervisor. The investigation concluded the agency violated its policy and state law requiring immediate reporting. The AW bears direct culpability for the violation, having admitted she knew the protocol but failed to follow it due to being off-duty and ill at the time of the call.",
