    "Pre-Exit with CA and CS\n04/13/2022 Contact – Face to face\nYouth B\n04/22/2022 Contact – Telephone call made\nDHHS Case Conference – a preponderance of evidence to\nsupport improper supervision was found.\nALLEGATION:\nOn 3/22/22, youth had a court hearing and did not like the results. Youth was\ndestructive towards property and threatening towards a staff member. Video\nfootage shows a staff member drove around the campus to look for youth. Youth\njumped on staff member's car and staff member drove the car with youth on the\nhood.\nINVESTIGATION:\nA complaint was received on 3/23/22 alleging on 3/22/22, Youth A had a court\nhearing and did not like the results. He broke the laptop used for the remote court\nhearing and two video monitoring cameras in the room. Youth A threatened to kill his\ntherapist. Staff 1 was in the room with Youth A at the time. Youth A left and returned\nto his unit. While on the unit he broke four additional video monitoring cameras.\nThe video footage shows, after Youth A left the building, Staff 1 was in his car to\nlook for Youth A as he could not be seen from the building. Youth A ran toward Staff\n1’s car. Staff 1 slowly backed his car away from Youth A, but Youth A jumped on the\nhood of the car. Staff 1 continued to slowly back down the hill/road then turned and\nleft Bethany campus. Staff 1 drove the car with Youth A still on the hood for about\n300 yards total. It is unknown how Youth A got off the hood. Youth A did not sustain\nany injuries. He did return to campus with a large rock and broke a window to get\ninto the building and then into a staff office to steal money. Youth A is currently in\ndetention.\nInterviews:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the county courthouse along with the DHHS\nWorker on 3/24/22. Youth A reported he left the facility the previous day due to an\norder to detain. He threw a rock through a window and broke into the supervisor’s\noffice. The facility has a hands-off policy meaning they do not restrain youth so when\nhe did these things the staff could not do anything. Staff 1 and Staff 2 were both\nworking when this occurred. Staff 2 told him he could make better choices, but he\nwas not listening to her. Staff 1 was in his car when Youth A hopped on the hood.\nStaff 1 then sped down the road. Youth A did not have any idea where Staff 1 was\ngoing. He was driving on the campus road then onto the main road. Youth A was on\nthe car the entire time. He was on the hood of car for about 10-15 minutes and the\ncar was moving the entire time. Youth A told Staff 1 to stop the car, but he wouldn't.\nPrior to this Staff 1 had called the police on Youth A because he was destroying\n3",
    "everything. He tried to talk to Staff 1 but Staff 1 jumped in his car and locked the\ndoors. Staff 1 flipped Youth A off and that is why Youth A jumped on his car. Youth A\nwas mad and yelling at Staff 1 but he wanted to talk. After he got off Staff 1's car,\nYouth A grabbed a rock so he could get back into the facility. Prior to this Youth A\nhad destroyed the cameras and a laptop. Youth A reported he has not done\nanything like this before. He was upset because during a court hearing his therapist\nwas making him sound like a “monster”. She said he was out of school for an entire\nweek, but he was not. She said he stole things. He did take another youth's coat and\nshoes, but they should not have taken his stuff. During the court hearing he called\nhis therapist a “B” and said, “If you want a monster, I will show you a monster.” No\none tried to stop him. Youth A stated he did not feel safe at the facility because he\nhad to worry if the staff were going to be respectful or not.\nThe Clinical Supervisor (CS) and Program Supervisor (PS) were interviewed face to\nface at the facility on 3/24/22 along with the DHHS Worker. CS reported Staff 1 will\nbe put on leave. Supervisor is handling the details. CS stated he became aware of\nthe car incident the morning after it occurred, however he was at the facility when it\noccurred. The following day PS watched the video after Staff 2 told him what\nhappened. PS reported Staff 1's direct supervisor had previously questioned some\nof Staff 1's decisions as she felt they were emotionally driven. Staff 1 takes it\npersonally when the youth do not succeed.\nCS said they knew Youth A would have a reaction from the court hearing. They did\nnot know it would have been this severe. Youth A has run away from the facility\nseveral times and that is what they thought would happen. After the incident the\npolice took Youth A to the hospital. He was supposed to be taken to detention from\nthe hospital, but that did not happen. Youth A came back to the facility and was kept\nseparate from the other youth with a one-on-one staff until he was picked up and\ntaken to detention the following day.\nCS was interviewed again face to face at the facility on 4/4/22. He reported during\nthe incident with Youth A he did not know Youth A was on the unit. He thought Youth\nA left the building. Staff 1 was not telling them what was actually going on or what\nwas needed. Due to some broken cameras, they could not always see where Youth\nA was, and they were all still participating in the court hearing. CS stated he had\ncalled the police prior to Staff 1 even asking and called again when they had not\nshown up fast enough.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/24/22 along with the DHHS\nWorker. The morning of 3/22/22 Youth A refused to go to school. Youth A and Youth\nB were going to play video games all day. The youth went around the unit taking\nvideo equipment and video games. At 3pm the second shift came in. The third staff\nwas late so Staff 2 stayed to cover. She met with Youth A's therapist and CS to talk\nabout what they would do regarding Youth A's court hearing. Their plan was to have\nYouth A in a room by himself where he could not have access to anything he could\ndestroy. They locked all the other doors and locked down the elevator so the only\n4",
    "place he could go without staff assistance was outside. Staff 1 went with Youth A to\nthe recovery room for his court hearing. Youth A had known he had something that\nday, but he did not know what it was. The rest of the group went to a different\nlocation for therapy. Youth B did not want to be in group, so he was brought back to\nthe unit and took a shower. Staff 2 stayed on the unit with Youth B. She watched the\ncamera footage of Youth A while he was in his court hearing. She saw Youth A and\nStaff 1 in the room. She could tell Youth A was becoming agitated. Youth A then\nthrew the laptop and busted the camera that was in the room. A few minutes later\nYouth A entered the unit. Staff 2 stated Staff 1 would have had to let Youth A into\nthe unit. Youth A became upset with another peer who was not on the unit, so he\nthrew the peers belongings all over. Youth A tried breaking several cameras on the\nunit. Staff 1 then left the unit. Youth B was still in the shower. Staff 2 went to the\nother unit to get the Assistant Supervisor who called the police. Youth A saw Staff 1\noutside on his phone, so he ran outside. Staff 1 got into his car and backed out of his\nparking sport. Youth A then jumped on Staff 1's hood. Staff 1 sped off down the\ndriveway then down the street toward the cross street. At the stop sign Youth A got\noff of Staff 1's car. Youth A came back to the facility followed by Staff 1 in his car.\nYouth A took a large rock and used it to break a window leading to the unit dining\nroom. He pushed the glass out with his hand and entered the unit. Youth B was out\nof the shower and in the living room area when Youth A came in. Staff 2 left the unit\nwith Youth B because it was not safe. The following day Staff 2 talked to PS about\nthe incident.\nYouth A's therapist (Therapist) was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/24/22\nalong with the DHHS Worker. Therapist stated she was present in the court hearing\nby video from her office. Youth A became upset because she told the truth. She told\nthe court Youth A was out of school a total of a week as he had missed two days\none week and three days the next. He also was not participating in treatment,\nengaging peers in negative behaviors, and stapled his ear to pierce it. When Youth\nA became upset, he started to pace and yell. He kicked the computer then slammed\nit against the wall. Staff 1 was in the room with Youth A. She then saw Youth A\nbreak a camera. She had the camera open on one of her monitors and the court\nhearing on the other. Youth A said, “F you” to Therapist. After the court hearing was\ndisconnected due to the broken laptop Therapist could no longer hear what Youth A\nwas saying. Staff 1 then texted Therapist and told her Youth A was threatening her\nlife. After the camera was broken and she could no longer see anything, Staff 1\ncame to her office to say that Youth A had gotten into the elevator and onto his unit.\nShe reported the elevator was supposed to be locked down. Youth A then destroyed\nthe cameras on the unit and left the building. Staff 1 then left her office to go follow\nYouth A. Therapist saw Staff 1 follow Youth A in his car. She did not see Youth A on\nthe hood of Staff 1's car but she was on the phone with Staff 1 when he reported\nYouth A jumped onto his car. She reported she was on and off the phone with Staff\n1 throughout the incident. She then saw Youth A hitting the unit window with a rock\nand broke it. Youth A entered the unit and went to the supervisor’s office. He broke\nthe camera so she could no longer see what he was doing on the unit. She then saw\nYouth A run to the east of the building where he was caught by the police. While\n5",
    "she was on the phone with Staff 1 and Youth A was on his car Staff 1 told her Youth\nA had a butterknife and was hitting his windshield with it.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/4/22 along with the DHHS\nWorker. He reported Youth A was sitting in the room talking about stealing Staff 1's\ncar and the items in it. He was saying these things prior to court starting. Court\nstarted and Youth A became upset about what Therapist was saying about school.\nYouth A called Therapist the \"B\" word. He then began to pace the room. Youth A\nswore again after Therapist stated it was hard to help someone without having\nrapport with them. The Judge told Youth A not to swear. Therapist continued to talk\nabout Youth A's behaviors at the facility and Youth A then began to stomp on the\nlaptop. Youth A said he was going to kill Therapist. He then broke the camera in the\nroom. Staff 1 texted Therapist and told her Youth A threatened her life. Youth A\npicked up the laptop and threw it against the wall. Staff 1 stated there was a plan\nprior to the court hearing because they knew Youth A would act out. They put him on\nthe middle floor in a room where he could only access the outside. They locked\ndown the elevator so Youth A could not get to the unit. Youth A walked toward the\nelevator which was stopped on the floor he was on and open. As Youth A went into\nthe open elevator Staff 1 went to talk to Therapist. Youth A was in the elevator by\nhimself, but the camera could see him. Staff 1 saw on the camera footage on his\nphone Youth A managed to get to the unit where Staff 2 and Youth B were. Staff 1\nwent to the unit and reported to Staff 2 what was going on. Staff 1 went to tell the CS\nand Therapist, who were together in one room, to call the police. Staff 1 said he had\na good relationship with Youth A and he tried to talk Youth A down prior to him\ngetting into the elevator. Staff 1 reported Youth B was in the shower when he got to\nthe unit. Staff 1 and Staff 2 talked to Youth A while he was on the unit. Youth A then\ntook a peer’s belongings from his room and destroyed them. Staff 1 went back to CS\nand Therapist to make sure they called the police. He did not feel they were doing\nanything about what was happening. When he saw CS and Therapist, they were\nwatching Youth A by camera and in the court hearing. They told Staff 1 a pickup\norder was in place. Staff 1 said that was not reassuring to him. He felt the situation\nwas not being handled by the others, so he called the police himself. Staff 1 went\noutside, and Youth A followed asking him what he was doing. Youth A had\nsomething in his hand and Staff 1 thought it was a knife. Youth A tried to use the\nknife to open the door to get back in the building. Staff 1 did not feel safe standing\nout in the open while Youth A had a knife, so he got into his car and pulled out of his\nparking spot. He locked his car doors. He called Therapist and police to give them\nan update. The Assistant Supervisor (AS) came out and talked to Staff 1 asking why\nhe was in his car. While they were talking Youth A walked up to the car. AS told Staff\n1 to hold tight. Staff 1 said he was a nervous reck and scared of what Youth A would\ndo. Staff 1 then backed up his car and Youth A jumped on it. Staff 1 was on the\nphone with Therapist at the time. Youth A was punching the windshield and using\nthe butt of the knife to hit it. Staff 1 was unsure where AS went. He “freaked out” and\nback the car up, turned and then drove away. He was still talking to Therapist, and\nshe told him to stop. He stopped and Youth A got off his car, grabbed a rock and\nthrew it at his car. Staff 1 said he got into his car because Youth A was between him\n6",
    "and the building. Staff 1 said he thought he was going about 5 miles per hour while\nYouth A was on the car. Staff 1 said Youth A never told him to stop. He thinks he\nwent about 300-400 meters. When he watched the video of the incident it did not\nlook like 5 miles per hour, he thought it looked a little faster. Staff 1 said he was\nconcerned he would get stabbed by Youth A. He has dealt with escalated youth\nbefore just not to this severity. It was different because Youth A had a knife. He did\nnot have a clue where Youth A got the knife. Sharp knives are locked up and butter\nknives were put behind the staff desk so the youth would not make food when they\nwere not supposed to. Staff 1 said he had concerns about being left alone with\nYouth A when they knew he would act out. He asked them to call the police and\nhave one on standby, but they would not do that. After Youth A got off the car Staff 1\nwas told to follow Youth A. Staff 1 followed Youth A back up to the facility. Once at\nthe facility Youth A grabbed a big rock and threw it at the unit window. The facility let\nother staff leave when they needed them to help with this situation.\nThe Assistant Supervisor (AS) was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/4/22\nalong with the DHHS Worker. She reported she was working on the other unit when\nshe was notified by Staff 2 and Therapist to call 911. She reported they came to her\nin person at once. Youth A was on the unit. Staff 1 went outside. Staff 2 told AS\nYouth A was upset because he thought Staff 1 called the police. AS asked what\nStaff 1 was doing outside and Staff 2 did not know. Youth A then went outside and\nAS went out shortly after. Youth A was walking around outside. She went to see\nwhat Staff 1 was doing. Staff 1 ran to his car and got inside. Staff 1's car was facing\nthe building when she approached it. Staff 1 had his phone in his hand talking to\nsomeone (she later found out it was Therapist). Youth A then walked toward Staff 1's\ncar and she walked back to the building. She did not see that Youth A had anything\nin his hand. Youth A was angry and yelling at her to open the door to the facility. She\ndid not know where Youth A was when she was talking to Staff 1. Once she was\ninside, she heard Therapist say, \"What? He is on your car?\" AS then went to the\nwindow to look out. She saw Youth A on top of Staff 1's car hood. Staff 1 was driving\nabout 15-20 mph going forward before the stop sign at the cross streets. Staff 1\nstopped at the stop sign at the cross streets. Youth A got off and Staff 1 turned left.\nShe then walked away and did not see Youth A pick up anything. She did not see\nthe video of the incident.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/13/22. He did not report any\nconcerns.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage of the incident was provided by PS and viewed at the facility on\n3/24/22. Video 1 is of the parking lot looking away from the facility. AS is seen\napproaching a silver car (PS indicates the car is Staff 1's). As AS approaches Staff\n1's car is pulling up the drive toward the facility. AS walks up to Staff 1’s car then\nwalks away. Youth A comes into view and Staff 1 begins to back up. Youth A jumps\non the hood of Staff 1's car and hits the windshield. Staff 1 continues to back up\ndown the drive. Staff 1 backs up into a driveway. Staff 1 then pulls out of the\n7",
    "driveway going forward down the side street. Youth A remains on the car as Staff 1\ndrives.\nA second video shows the parking lot of the building in front of the facility. Staff 1's\ncar is seen with Youth A still on the hood driving forward passing the building and\ncontinuing into the neighborhood.\nWhile at the facility on 3/24/22 the location of the incident was viewed. On the south\nside of the facility is the staff parking lot. At the end of the parking lot and to the east\nis a drive leading to the rest of campus. Going south past the drive, leaving campus,\nthere is a building on the east side of the street. This building is the location of the\nsecond video. Continuing south on this street is a neighborhood leading to a cross\nstreet with a stop sign. The distance from the facility to the stop sign was measured\nto be .2 miles on this consultant’s odometer.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Youth A’s case file in MiSACWIS was reviewed. Youth A was admitted to the\nfacility on 9/3/21 and was discharged to detention on 3/23/22. Youth A was\nreceiving sexual offender treatment but was not taking responsibility for the\noffense. Youth A is resistant to treatment. He is oppositional and defiant. He\nhas a history of self-harm, suicidal ideation, and running away.\n Driver Acknowledgement of Policy: states staff agree to fully comply with\ncurrent and future laws and ordinances governing the operation and storage\nof motor vehicles.\n Vehicles Use, Safety, Maintenance and Accident Policy and Procedure: safe\ntransportation of youth will be provided through appropriate vehicle use and\ncompliance with safety standards. All state traffic laws will be followed. This\napplies to all staff that use agency, rental or personal vehicles for facility\nbusiness.\n Incident Reports: All Incident Reports were written by Staff 2 and matched the\ninformation provided in her interview.\n Staff 1 employee file: Staff 1 was hired on 1/18/21. He had no discipline\nrecords. He signed the driver acknowledgement on 1/18/21. He received CPI\ntraining on 3/24/21 and Special De-escalation/Safety planning on 3/2/22.\nA DHHS Case Conference was attended on 4/22/22 and the DHHS Worker reported\nshe has a preponderance of evidence.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position\nassigned.\n8",
    "ANALYSIS: Staff 1 drove his car with Youth A on the hood. This behavior\ndemonstrates that Staff 1 does not have the ability or\nexperience to perform his duties. The DHHS worker had a\nfinding of improper supervision.\nTechnical Assistance:\nAll staff need to be made aware of your new cell phone policy. A\nworking phone always needs to be available for emergencies.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nStaff left youth unsupervised.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews:\nThe Clinical Supervisor (CS) was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/24/22\nand 4/4/22. He reported the facility is an open residential treatment facility for youth\nwith sexual behaviors. There are 11 boys on Youth A’s unit. They have a ratio of five\nyouth to one staff. CS stated the units have phones on them and they would have\nbeen in working order on 3/22/22. The staff can utilize their personal cell phones in\nan emergency, but cell service can be spotty on the units.\nDuring Staff 2’s interview on 3/24/22 she reported during the incident on 3/22/22\nStaff 1 told Staff 2 he would be right back and left the unit. She did not know where\nhe went. She was the only staff on the unit. Youth A became upset with another peer\nwho was not on the unit, so he threw the peers belongings all over. Youth A tried\nbreaking several cameras on the unit. Staff 1 then left the unit. Youth B was still in\nthe shower. Staff 2 went to the other unit to get the Assistant Supervisor who called\nthe police. Staff 2 reported she was only gone about 30 seconds. The unit did not\nhave a working phone and she did not think of using her cell phone. Youth B was\nstill in the shower when she returned. She reported it was possible for Youth A to\nenter the shower while Youth B was in there, but she did not think he did. Based on\nStaff\nDuring Therapists interview on 3/24/22 she reported Staff 1 came to her office to\ninform her Youth A had got into the elevator and onto his unit. Therapist stated Staff\n1 went to her office initially because he tried calling her and he could not get through\non the phone. She did not know who was on the unit when Staff 1 came to see her.\nStaff 1 stated during his interview on 4/4/22 he texted Therapist while Youth A was\nstill in the room and told her Youth A threatened her life. As Youth A went into the\nopen elevator Staff 1 went to talk to Therapist. Youth A was in the elevator by\nhimself, but the camera could see him. Staff 1 left Youth A on the unit with Staff 2\nand Youth B to go tell CS and Therapist, who were together in one room, to call the\n9",
    "police. Staff 1 reported they had shut the phones down on the unit so the youth\ncould not call whomever and whenever they wanted. He could not call anyone on his\ncell phone because they have a no cell phone policy. Staff 1 stated it depends on\nthe kid if they can leave them alone while escalated or leave them with one staff. He\nstated there is usually only one staff dealing with an escalated youth. After Staff 1\nwent back to the unit Youth A was destroying other youths belongings so Staff 1 left\nagain to tell CS and Therapist to call the police. He did not think they were taking it\nserious enough, so he went outside to call the police. Staff 1 said he was previously\ndisciplined for using his cell phone when he was not supposed to.\nAS was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/4/22. She reported she was on a\ndifferent unit when Staff 2 came to her in person to tell her to call the police. AS did\nnot know who was on the unit with Youth A. She then saw Staff 1 go outside. AS\nsaid, it is not typical to leave one staff alone with an escalated youth. They can use\nthe landline or their cell phone to call for help. They are allowed to use their cell\nphones for work purposes only.\nTour Observation:\nA tour of the unit was provided on 3/24/22. There were two landlines on the unit, one\non the staff desk and one in the kitchen. Both were in working order and the desk\nphone was able to call this consultant’s cell phone. The unit doors are self-closing\ndoors. The entrance to the other unit was also a self-closing door and was directly\nopposite Youth A’s unit door. Staff 2 was present for the tour, she said both doors\nclosed behind her when she left the unit to get help. She also stated the phones had\nbeen removed because they were afraid the youth would destroy them.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n Staff 1’s employee file did not have a discipline for using his cell phone.\n Staff 2’s employee file indicated she has no disciplinary record.
