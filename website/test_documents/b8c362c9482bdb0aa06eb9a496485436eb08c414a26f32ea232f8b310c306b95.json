It addressed the opening of a special evaluation rather than completing\nan addendum when allegations are like one’s previously investigated. It is noted\nthat the current citation within this interim inspection pertains to the initiation of the\nspecial evaluation within seven days, rather than just opening a special evaluation.\n14",
    "The agency submitted a corrective action plan for SIR#2019C0219001 initiated on\n10/04/2018. It appropriately addressed placement of foster children in home IL\nprovider’s homes without being appropriately assessed for IL as no repeat citations\nare noted.\nThe 07/09/2018 analyst report was reviewed and follow up to concerns are as\nfollows:\nSafety and Concern Alert #1:\nSafety issue: The Analyst observed that the basement was being used as living\nspace with no window that family members could use as an\nemergency exit. The foster parents reported that the original\nlicensing worker who did their home study did not inform them that\nthey were out of compliance. They said their license became active\n04/05/2018. They said they became aware of the non-compliance\nwhen a second licensing worker visited their home during the first\nweek of 06/2018.\nResolution: The foster parents were made aware of the\nrequirements for basements during orientation. Licensing worker’s\n03/26/2018 email to foster parent, prior to licensure, states\nbasement cannot be used. Foster parents have furniture in\nbasement that cannot be relocated. Foster parents reminded of\nrequirements regarding basement living spaces and signed a\nbasement usage agreement.\nConcern: The foster parents say that the agency did not provide information\nabout a discontinuance of the child’s psychiatric medication. They\nsay that when they went to pick the child up, institution that\nreleased the child did not release this information, either. The\nfoster parents reported that the child had been taking Zoloft for a\nlong period of time. The foster parents said that without the\nmedication, there were behavior changes that made the child a\ndanger to herself, other people, and animals in the foster home.\nResolution: The residential facility where the foster child was\nplaced prior the foster home discontinued the foster child’s Zoloft.\nDCWL does not regulate the clinical directives of physicians.\nConcern: The foster parents reported that the foster care worker refused to\nprovide a referral to a psychiatrist, so they could have the child\nevaluated and receive assistance with managing her behavior\nchanges.\nResolution: The agency had the case nine days before the foster\nchild was removed and placed in a residential facility. The child\n15",
    "previously had a psychiatric evaluation and was discontinued\nmedication. It is noted that the foster child refused to stay in the\npre-adoptive home.\nConcern: The foster parents also reported that the caseworker who was\nassigned at the time did not visit the child for 7 days after she was\nplaced in the home.\nResolution: Case record review confirms that a face-to-face\ncontact with between the foster child and case manager did not\noccur within five days of placement. The agency was cited as non-\ncompliant.\nSafety and Concern Alert #2:\nSafety issue: One child is sleeping on a mattress on the floor. He needs a\nbedframe.\nResolution: The agency received the alert on 06/15/2018 with a\ndue date for completion of 06/22/2018 in which a bedframe was to\nbe obtained. The foster parent requested that the foster children be\nremoved as the landlord asked her to move and foster parent\nconsequently moving into senior housing. The foster children were\nremoved from the home on 06/22/2018.\nConcern: Relative stated that she was not provided with information on\nfinancial assistance or resources.\nResolution: Relative was instructed to contact DHHS to apply for\ncash assistance and food stamps for support.\nSafety and Concern Alert #3:\nSafety issue: The home has a pond in the backyard. There are bells on the door\nas an alert, but the home does not have rescue items such as a\nflotation ring or shepherd hook in case of emergency.\nResolution: The foster home was not licensed by the agency, but\nrather licensed through another regional office of the Samaritas\norganization. The licensing agency was made aware of the\ndeficient rescue item on 07/09/2018 and was delivered to the home\non 07/11/2018 with the confirmation picture being sent by the foster\nparent on 07/13/2018. The agency was reminded that urgent\nsafety alerts need to be addressed immediately regardless of the\nresponsible licensing agency\n16",
    "Concern: There are ongoing issues with the transfer of medical records,\nwhich has resulted in a delay of medical and mental health services\nfor the child.\nResolution: Case record review indicates foster child receiving\ntherapy from time of placement through 12/2017 when her therapist\nwent into private practice and at which time foster child followed her\ntherapist. Foster child transferred back to her original CMH in\n09/2018 where she has continued therapy. Foster child’s last\nphysical examination occurred on 08/22/2017 and the annual\nupdated examination is pending. The agency was cited as non-\ncompliant. It is noted that the agency was not servicing the foster\ncare case, rather it was being serviced through another, separately\nlicensed, regional office of the Samaritas organization. The agency\nwas provided technical assistance on placement.\nConcern: The relative said she does not have the child’s medical insurance\ncard.\nResolution: Case record review indicates the relative receiving the\nchild’s medical insurance card at time of her placement on\n08/03/32016. It is noted that the agency was not servicing the\nfoster care case, rather it was being serviced through another,\nseparately licensed, regional office of the Samaritas organization.\nThe agency was provided technical assistance on placement.\nConcern: The relative reported that the caseworker does not maintain contact\nwith her.\nResolution: Case record review indicates regular contacts between\nthe case manager and relative being made.
