    "Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care, safety, and\nsupervision, methods for addressing residents' needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A staff member allowed a youth to use their cellphone to access\nsocial media and contact relatives around 1/29/25.\nInvestigation Interviews\nComplainant was interviewed on 05/06/2025 by phone.\nComplainant did not have additional information.\nYouth A was interviewed on 05/11/2025 at Wayne County\nJuvenile Detention. Youth A denied using a staff’s cell phone to\ncontact her sister through a staff’s Instagram account. Youth A\nalso denied requesting a staff to reach her sister through\nInstagram messaging.\nYouth B and Youth C were interviewed separately on 05/15/2025\nat Wayne County Juvenile Detention. Youth B and Youth C stated\nthey have never seen a staff use their personal cell phone on the\nunit or elsewhere in the facility. Youth B and Youth C also denied\never seeing a youth use a staff’s personal cell phone.\nFormer Staff (FS) resigned from Wayne County Juvenile\nDetention in 03/2025. Attempts to interview FS by phone were\nmade on 05/15/2025, 05/21/2025 and 05/23/2025. A return call\nwas not received.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 05/8/2025 at Wayne County Juvenile\nDetention. Staff 1 stated she primarily works on the female units.\nStaff 1 stated she never witnessed a staff use their personal cell\nphone on the unit or allow a youth to use their personal cell\nphone.\nYouth A’s Sister (YS) was interviewed on 05/06/2025 by phone.\nYS stated she received an Instagram message from FS stating\nshe was one of the “guards” at Wayne County Juvenile Detention\nand asked for her phone number. YS stated she asked FS if she\nwas contacted on behalf of Youth A and did not receive a reply.\nYS stated she did not provide FS with her cell phone number\nbecause she had cell phone service issues. YS stated this was\nher only contact with FS. YS forwarded a screen shot of her\ncontact with FS and stated FS deleted the initial message sent by\nFS.\n2",
    "Documentation\nScreenshot of FS Instagram message states FS and YS do not\nfollow each other, but they follow two mutual people. There are no\nmessages from FS on the screen shot. YS messaged FS back on\n01/20/2025 with “I am did you get my page from her?” and “Ok\ngive me a second”.\nWayne County Juvenile Detention’s Code of Ethics policy and\nprocedure 3.1 I states “Staff shall not encourage, engage in or\nfraternize with any resident who received services by the Juvenile\nDetention Facility (JDF), while on or off duty. There will be no\nconduct, whether on or off the job, that adversely affects the\nemployee’s ability to perform his/her current job or which\nadversely affects the Institution’s ability to carry out its assigned\nmission. Staff will under no circumstances share personal\ninformation. Staff will under no circumstances take pictures or\nvideos of residents.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance because the Instagram\nmessage does not identify Youth A, and it is inconclusive what the\nnature of the contact was between FS and YS. In addition, Youth\nA denied requesting FS to reach out to YS on Youth A’s behalf\nand denied using FS’s phone.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n06/03/2025\n______________________________________\nVivian D Malleck Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 3, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n3"
