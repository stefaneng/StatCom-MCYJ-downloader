INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nDescription (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nand able to meet the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Case worker gave caregiver permission to allow a 12-year-old\nfoster child to watch pornography.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was interviewed by phone on 5/9/25. Complainant\nstated that a TDM was held on 5/7/25 to discuss two other\nchildren in the case. However, in the meeting, safety planning was\ndiscussed regarding the return home of Youth with the other\nchildren. The safety plan included cameras in the home, checking\nthe kids at night, children changing, and showering separately,\netc. Foster Care Worker then asked to add information that\nYouth’s safety plan included information about viewing\npornography. Foster Care Worker said they told fictive kin it was\nappropriate and normal, and Youth was allowed to view material\nas long as no other child was in the room. TDM Facilitator asked\nhow old Youth was. Foster Care Worker answered that he was 12\nyears old. TDM Facilitator asked Foster Care Worker if she was\naware that someone had to be 18 years old to access\npornography. Foster Care Worker seemed surprised and stated\nthey did not know there was an age requirement. Parent stated\nshe did not support allowing Youth to watch sexual material.\nParent reported there would be parental controls at home to\nprevent access. Parent stated she would have age-appropriate\nconversations with Youth about his body, safety, consent, etc.\nDHHS Worker stated Foster Care Worker needed to discuss this\nissue and provide clarification to Foster Parent that pornography\nwas inappropriate. Foster Parent was not in attendance at the\nmeeting. Foster Care Worker did not respond initially, as she\nseemed to be having trouble with her phone. After the meeting,\nTDM Facilitator sent the meeting report and reiterated in an email\nthat the issue needed to be addressed with Foster Parent.\nComplainant reported Foster Care Worker’s supervisor was\npresent for the start of the meeting but had to leave early and\nmissed the conversation regarding pornography.\n2",
    "Chief Administrator was notified of the investigation via email on\n5/9/25. Chief Administrator responded she did not have first-hand\nknowledge of the incident.\nDHHS Worker was interviewed via video call on 5/9/25. DHHS\nWorker confirmed she was at the TDM on 5/7/25. Foster Care\nWorker did not say she or Foster Parent allowed Youth to watch\npornography. The discussion arose at the TDM as there was\nconcern about Youth trying to access pornography. This concern\nwas brought to the attention of Foster Care Worker, by Foster\nParent. The TDM discussion was to safety plan with the parents\nas return home may be occurring soon. Foster Care Worker\nstated Youth was curious about sex and tried to access\ninappropriate material. Therefore, it was important for Parent to\nspeak with him about what is appropriate, and privacy with his\nbody, as there are younger children in the home. Foster Care\nWorker attended the meeting by phone and had some difficulty\nwith her phone service. Therefore, some of what she said was\nhard to understand and may have been misheard. TDM Facilitator\nasked Foster Care Worker to restate what she said. Foster Care\nWorker said she would speak with Foster Parent about it. TDM\nFacilitator stated that someone needed to be 18 to access\npornography. Foster Care Worker stated that she was aware.\nAfter the meeting, DHHS Worker spoke with Foster Care Worker.\nIt was clarified that Youth accessed inappropriate material, prior to\nFoster Parent putting parental controls on their phone. Foster\nParent was not “letting” Youth access the material. Foster Care\nWorker brought it up in the meeting in order to safety plan with\nParent for return home. Foster Care Worker wanted Parent to be\naware that Youth was attempting to sneak and watch things he\nshould not. Foster Care Worker did not give Youth or Foster\nParent permission for Youth to watch pornography. The worker\nwas trying to notify the group that a situation happened, and they\nneeded to continue to address it. DHHS Worker stated Foster\nCare Worker maybe could have worded things better and also her\nphone cutting out may have contributed to confusion about what\nwas being said.\nAttempts were made to interview Parent on 5/27/25 and 5/29/25.\nTwo phone numbers were attempted, but both were not in\nservices.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via video call on 5/29/25.\nThe allegation was read, and she stated it was incorrect. Foster\nCare Worker said her words were twisted and that was not what\nshe said in the meeting. Foster Care Worker stated she told\n3",
    "Foster Parent that Youth’s curiosity was normal for that age, but\nthey needed to take precautions to stop him from watching\npornography. Foster Care Worker noted pornography was\neverywhere, especially if Youth had access to social media.\nFoster Care Worker told Youth and Foster Parent he should not\nbe accessing inappropriate material especially because there\nwere young children around; if he were to look at something it\nshould be in the privacy of his own room. Foster Care Worker was\nasked if she could hear how that may sound like she was giving\nhim permission to watch inappropriate material as long as he was\nin his room. Foster Care Worker stated she could see now that\nsomeone might think that, but it was definitely not what she\nmeant. Foster Care Worker stated Youth had accessed\npornography before but had not tried to in a while. Regardless,\nshe brought up the topic to safety plan with the parents for return\nhome. Parent said she would put parental controls on tablet and\nphones and ensure Youth did not watch anything inappropriate.\nThe plan was also to limit access to technology and put him in\nextra activities to limit his free time. Foster Care Worker stated\nthere was conversation with Parent and Foster Parent about\nremoving technology and appropriate discipline if Youth attempted\nto access pornography again. Foster Parent was never given\npermission to allow Youth to watch inappropriate material. Foster\nCare Worker stated that Licensing Supervisor was present for a\nconversation regarding this.\nLicensing Supervisor was interviewed by phone on 5/29/25.\nLicensing Supervisor stated he went to the foster home on 5/12/25\nwith Foster Care Worker and spoke with Foster Parent about\nYouth viewing inappropriate material online. Licensing Supervisor\nalso spoke with Youth, who stated he looked at pornography\npreviously, out of curiosity. Licensing Supervisor discussed\nYouths behaviors with Foster Parent. The main concern was\ndestruction of the home and overeating. Youth had demonstrated\nimpulsivity and stated previously he did not know why he did the\nthings he did. It was determined a psychiatric evaluation would be\nscheduled. Licensing Supervisor stated there had not been any\nrecent concerns about pornography that he was aware of.\nHowever, there was a safety plan in place that Foster Parent and\nParent agreed to. The plan was to put parental locks on\ntechnology around the house and to redirect Youth if he was\naccessing anything he should not. Foster Parent was able to\nmonitor Youth’s technology usage in real time and check history if\nthere were concerns. This safety plan was discussed with Foster\nCare Worker and Foster Parent during the visit. Licensing Worker\nstated he had a conversation with Foster Care Worker after the\n4",
    "visit and it was clear she did not condone Youth’s behavior,\nalthough it was not unusual for a youth of that age to be curious.\nFoster Parent was interviewed by phone on 6/4/25. Foster Parent\nwas informed of the allegation and stated it was not accurate.\nFoster Parent was not in attendance at the TDM on 5/7/25.\nHowever, Foster Care Worker had never told her it was ok to\nallow Youth to watch pornography. Youth had attempted to\naccess pornography and Foster Parent caught him. Foster Parent\nreported this to Foster Care Worker and a safety plan was\ndeveloped. Foster Care Worker told Foster Parent that she\nunderstood it was impossible to monitor Youth 24/7. However,\nthey could use parental controls to monitor online activity. They\nshould also ensure he was not alone with other youth, where he\ncould attempt to show them something inappropriate. Foster\nParent stated she was clear that it was not ok for Youth to watch\npornography, even if he was alone. Foster Care Worker never\ngave caregiver or Youth “permission” to allow it.\nDocuments\n• 5/8/25 email from TDM Facilitator to DHHS Worker and\nFoster Care Worker: “Please address with (Youth’s) foster\nmother that an adult cannot encourage a minor child to\nview any pornography”.\n• TDM report dated 5/7/25: Attendees: Parent, DHHS\nWorker, Foster Care Worker. “The parents will talk to\n(Youth) about the negativity of watching pornographic\nmaterial and discuss age-appropriate about sex and safe\ntouch/safe space”.\nAnalysis Based on interviews it does not appear Foster Care Worker gave\n“permission” to Foster Parent for Youth to watch pornography. Per\nFoster Parent, DHHS Worker, Licensing Supervisor, and Foster\nCare Worker, the intent was to address a recent behavior and\nprovide a safety plan. However, the way in which Foster Care\nWorker expressed this information was interpreted differently by\nComplainant, who was not directly involved in the case.\nCONSULTATION:\nFoster Care Worker was cautioned to think about what she says\nand how it may be heard by others.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
