He interviewed Youth B, Youth C, and Youth D and\nthey denied any inappropriate touching by Youth A. He reviewed\nthe video footage and reported that Youth A and B were sitting on\na two-seat chair with a blanket on their lap, and two staff members\nwere sitting behind them. He could not see anything inappropriate\nhappening, but the blanket on the youth’s lap was a barrier. This\nwas addressed with staff to ensure there are no barriers when\n2",
    "supervising the youths. He also said he reviewed several days of\nvideo footage and was only able to see one bathroom incident\ninvolving Youth A. Youth B went to the shower around 2:50 pm,\nand at 3:00 pm Youth walked onto the wing, walked up to the\nbathroom door, knocked on the door, opened the door, peaked in,\nand closed the door. He said the whole exchange was less than\n30 seconds. Youth A was moved to blue wing, Youth C and D are\non the Green Wing, and Youth B has been discharged from the\nprogram and is now in an Independent Living Program.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 02/21/2023. Youth A is 14\nyears old and has been at the facility for eight months. Youth A is\non the Blue Wing. Youth A said she and Youth B were sitting on\nthe couch watching television, they had a blanket on their lap,\ntheir legs were touching, but nothing inappropriate happened. She\nsaid she did rub Youth B’s leg because Youth B was upset, but\nshe denied touching her inappropriately. She said there were two\nstaff members sitting behind them. Youth A said there was an\nincident in December where she kissed Youth C while they were\nin the bathroom. She could not provide a date or time. She said\nstaff were present, but she sneaked into the bathroom when staff\nwere not looking.\nI interviewed Youth C at the facility on 02/21/2023. Youth C has\nbeen at the facility for one year and is on the Green Wing. Youth\nC denied any inappropriate touching and denied ever being in the\nbathroom with Youth A. She said Youth A has made up lies about\nher and Youth D. Youth C said staff are always on the wing\nsupervising them. She reported no concerns regarding staff or the\nfacility.\nI attempted to interview Youth D at the facility on 02/21/2023, but\nshe refused to be interviewed.\nI received an email from Youth A’s Foster Care Specialist 1 on\n02/27/2023. She stated Youth A is on 1:1 staff supervision due to\nmental health concerns. She met with Youth A on 02/17/2023 and\nYouth A denied the allegation of inappropriate touching with\npeers.

    "I interviewed Youth D’s Foster Care Specialist 3 via telephone on\n03/06/2023. Foster Care Specialist said she spoke with Youth D\nand Youth D denied any inappropriate touching with another\nyouths. She said Youth D reported feeling safe and did not\nexpress any concerns regarding any staff members.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 03/09/2023. Staff 1 is a direct\ncare worker and has been working at the facility for 3 months. He\nsaid in late December Youth B told him that Youth A is very\ntouchy with her. He never saw the two youths do any\ninappropriate touching. He informed the supervisor, and an\nincident report was completed.\nI interviewed Youth B on 03/17/2023. Youth B requested to be\ninterviewed via telephone. Youth B reported she was discharged\nfrom the facility on 01/27/2023. She denied any inappropriate\ntouching between her and Youth A. She didn’t like that Youth A\nhad rubbed her leg when they were watching television, so she\ntold staff and Youth A was moved to a different wing. She denied\nany inappropriate touching occurred in the bathroom involving\nYouth A or any other resident. She was agitated during the\ninterview and said she is tired of people questioning her about\nYouth A. She reported no concerns or issues with supervision\nwhile she was at the facility.\nOn 3/6/23 Foster Care Specialist 1 shared a new concern that an\nunidentified staff told Youth A to kill herself on an unidentified\ndate. I interviewed Rights Officer on 03/09/2023, who said he\naddressed Youth A’s claim against Staff 2 last month. After\nlooking into the matter, Rights Officer said there were no\nwitnesses and nothing to support that Staff 2 said this. Upon\ninterviewing Staff 2, Rights Officer said she denied telling Youth A\nto kill herself. Instead, as Youth A announced she was going to\nher room, Staff 2 supported the youth’s decision, remarking, “Do\nwhat you have to do to calm down.”\nI interviewed Youth A again on 03/09/2023. Youth A said that last\nmonth she was upset but could not recall why she was angry. She\ntold Staff 2 she said she was going to her room to self-harm and\nStaff 2 told her “I don’t care if you kill yourself.” Youth A said she\ntold the Supervisor about the incident. Youth A was asked what\nhappens if she is talking about self-harming and she said staff call\nthe nurse and doctor.\n4",
    "I interviewed Consumer Rights Officer on 03/09/2023. He reported\nthere was an incident reported completed by the Supervisor dated\n02/05/2023. He reviewed the incident reported and spoke with\nStaff 2. He said Staff 2 said Youth A was agitated and said she\nwas going to her room and Staff 2 told her, “Do what you have to\ndo to calm down.” Consumer Rights Officer reported Youth A is\non a one to one due to her mental health.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility on 03/28/2023. She\nreported on 02/05/2023 Youth A was agitated and was being\naggressive with other residents and Staff. Youth A told Supervisor\n1 that Staff 2 told her to kill herself. Supervisor 1 denied\nwitnessing or hearing Staff 2 say that to Youth A. Supervisor said\nan incident report was completed and she contacted the on-call\nnurse.\nI interviewed Staff 2 via telephone on 03/30/2023. Staff 2 is a\ndirect care worker and has been working at the facility for one\nyear. Staff 2 reported on the day in question Youth A was irritated\nand arguing with the other residents on the wing. She tried to talk\nto Youth A to calm down, but Youth A walked away and said she\nwas going to her bedroom. Staff 2 said she told Youth A, “do what\nyou have to do to calm down.” A few minutes later Youth A came\nout of her bedroom and told Staff 2, “you told me to kill myself.”\nStaff 2 said she has been working in residential programs for over\n40 years and would never say that to any youth.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident Report dated 12/26/2022, written by Supervisor 1.\nYouth B reported she is uncomfortable on her wing\nbecause Youth A tried to rub her hand on her leg. No\nfurther concerns reported. Youths were placed on different\nwings and consumer rights officer was notified.\n• Consumer Rights Officers notes dated 12/29/2022. Youth A\nreported she did rub Youth B leg under the blanket while\nstaff were sitting behind them. Youth B reported that Youth\nA was rubbing her leg under the blanket. As a safety\nmeasure the two youths were placed on different wings and\nthe two youths were not to have any contact given the\nallegations that were made. Staff were advised that if\nyouths require blankets in the sitting area, that it is one\nblanket per seating arrangement. Also, the chairs/couches\nor any other items should never be blocking staff\nsupervision.\n• Screenshots of the video dated 12/26/2022. Two staff\nmembers are sitting behind the couch that the two youths\n5",
    "are sitting on, with one blanket over the two youth’s laps\nand hands.\n• Youth A’s treatment plan dated 02/07/2023. Youth is on 1:1\nsupervision starting 01/03/2023 through 04/03/2023 due to\nsafety concerns including physically aggressive behaviors,\nself-harmful behaviors, increased mood lability, increased\nimpulsive behaviors and an inability to demonstrate\nconsistent emotionally regulated behaviors.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is insufficient\nevidence that staff were not supervising or were aware of\ninappropriate touching by Youth A. On 12/26/2026, Youth B\nreported Youth A had rubbed her leg when they were sitting on a\nsofa watching television. As a safety measure the two youths\nwere placed on different wings and the two youths were not to\nhave any contact given the allegations that were made. Youth A\nreported that she had kissed Youth C in the bathroom, but Youth\nC denied any inappropriate contact with Youth A. Based on the\ninterview of the Youths, staff, and review of documentation it could\nnot be determined if any inappropriate touching occurred. The\nfacility took the appropriate actions and placed the youths on\ndifferent wings.\nThe facility is in compliance with the additional allegation about\nstaff telling Youth A to kill herself. Staff report Youth A was\nagitated and said she was going to her room and Staff said, “do\nwhat you have to do to calm down.” Youth A said staff told her “I\ndon’t care if you kill yourself.” The Supervisor interviewed denied\nhearing the staff say that to the youth. There were no other\nwitnesses, therefore it could not be determined that staff said that\nto the youth.\nConsultation:\nIt is recommended that all staff be advised that they need to\nensure there no barriers (chairs, couch, blankets, etc.) blocking\ntheir view of the youths.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 5, 2023\n____________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 11, 2023\n_____________________________________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n7"
