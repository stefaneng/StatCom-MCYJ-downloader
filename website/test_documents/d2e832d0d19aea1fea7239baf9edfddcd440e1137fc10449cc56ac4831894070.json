Complainant stated Youth A wasn’t very clear on what\nthose concerns were but made a statement that her mattress had\nsprings sticking out. Complainant was unsure if this meant springs\nwere sticking through the mattress covering or if Youth A could\nfeel the springs inside the mattress. Complainant added Youth A\nmight have been high at the time of her intake meeting, so Youth\nA did not provide clear or detailed information.\nProgram Director – On 2/29/2024 Program director was\ninterviewed by phone. He reported Youth A was initially placed in\nan Independent Living Plus (ILP) home in the flint area, but she\nwas moved to an ILP home in Lansing a few weeks ago. He\nreported that youth are not supposed to have food in their rooms,\nbut a previous youth in that home was eating and keeping food in\nher room after which they started noticing mouse activity in the\nhome. He stated they never had a mouse problem before that\nyouth arrived. The staff of the home are continually reminding the\nyouth currently in the home they are not to have food in their\nrooms.

    "On 3/4/2024 a walkthrough of the home was completed. The main\nliving areas of the home, including the kitchen, dining area, living\nroom, and bathroom were clean and tidy. No evidence of mouse\nactivity was observed. Youth A’s room was viewed and appeared\nvery cluttered and unkept. The floor was covered in dirty clothing\nand her desk was strewn with wrappers and fast-food\nbags/containers. The entrance to the attic was observed in the\nceiling of the closet. It was noted the room smelled strongly of\nmarijuana. Staff 1 stated Youth A’s worker came to visit her a few\ndays ago and found marijuana laying out on the desk. Staff 1\nstated she has had to report Youth A for possessing and using\nvapes and marijuana multiple times. The bedroom of the other\nyouth living in the home was viewed. That room was clean and\ntidy. It was noted the room smelled like food and there was a\ntakeout container of food sitting on that youth’s desk. The\nremaining two bedrooms, both of which were unoccupied, were\nviewed. One bedroom was nearly empty other than a few small\nitems, the other room contained spare bedframes, mattresses,\nbox springs, and bags full of a former youth’s belongings.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\n• Orkin Special Service Agreement for treatment of rodents\non 1/9/2024\n• Orkin Commercial Service Agreement to provide monthly\ntreatment for 1-year dated 1/9/2024.\n• Orkin-Therm Service Agreement Estimate dated 1/9/2024.\n• Youth A’s case record documenting she is AWOL as of\n3/6/2024.\nAnalysis The home appears clean and safe, and the agency is actively\naddressing the concerns of mice in the home.
