Youth had\na headache and body trimmers and asked for medication to sleep\nbetter. A staff member gave youth Ibuprofen medication. The\nyouth can't have Ibuprofen because youth is on Lithium. Staff\nmember didn't check the medication log because staff was unable\nto get to it. At 7am in the morning, another staff member started\nshift and noticed the error and then reported it to the social\nworker. The on-call nurse was then made aware of the incident.\nStaff was asked to then monitor youth to make sure youth didn't\nhave any reactions to the Ibuprofen. Youth is fine, and didn't\nsustain any behavior changes or injuries from this incident.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nClinical Supervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility\non February 18, 2025. Clinical Supervisor reported he was on-\ncall over the weekend. He reported on February 15, 2025, at 7 am\nhe received a phone call from Staff 2 stating Youth A was\nprovided an incorrect medication from Staff 1 overnight. Clinical\nSupervisor reported he was informed Youth A was provided\nIbuprofen for a headache overnight which he cannot have due to\nbeing on Lithium. He reported Nurse was in contact right away\nand Youth A was monitored. Due to the low dose of Ibuprofen,\nYouth A was monitored and showed no concerning side effects.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nFebruary 18, 2025. Youth A reported he is recovering from not\nfeeling well over the weekend. He reported when he does not feel\nwell, he asks the staff for medicine to help with his cold and fever.\nYouth A reported over the weekend Staff 1 and Staff 2 provided\nhim his medication. He reported he remembered one night over\nthe weekend when he woke up in the middle of the night and\nasked Staff 1 for medication for a headache. Youth A reported\nStaff 1 provided him with Tylenol and he went back to bed. He\nreported that Tylenol made him feel a lot better.

    "Staff 1 was interviewed via phone on February 19, 2025. Staff\n1 reported she is an on-call worker for the facility but has been\nemployed there for six years. She reported she has been trained\nin medication passing but has had difficulty logging into the Quick\nMar system. Staff 1 reported this is normally not an issue because\nshe does not pass medication on the third shift. She reported\nworking the third shift with Staff 2 from February 14, 2025, to\nFebruary 15, 2025. Staff 1 reported Youth A had woken up around\n3:45am stating that he was not feeling well and had a headache.\nShe reported she looked around for Staff 2 since she could not log\ninto the Quick Mar system, but Staff 2 was not on the unit. Staff 1\nreported she waited a little bit, but Youth A was getting drowsier,\nso she just provided him with two tablets of Ibuprofen. She\nreported she saw Staff 3 a few moments later and asked her to\nlog the medications she provided to Youth A. Staff 1 reported\naround 6 am, Staff 3 asked her again what medication she\nprovided Youth A so that she could log it, and Staff 1 told her two\ntablets of Ibuprofen. She reported Staff 2 came onto shift at 5 am\nand was working with Staff 3 on medications. Staff 1 reported\nStaff 2 informed her that Youth A cannot have Ibuprofen due to\nthis not being on his approved medication list. She reported she\nfelt horrible about the situation. Staff 1 immediately reported this\nmedication error to Clinical Supervisor and Nurse. She reported\nthe proper protocol for passing medications is for staff to check\nthe Quick Mar system to make sure the medications are approved\nbut she failed to follow that protocol. Staff 1 reported she should\nhave waited for Staff 3 to provide the medications as she did not\nhave access to Quick Mar to verify the medication.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on February 24, 2025. Staff\n3 reported she worked the third shift with Staff 1 from February 14,\n2025, to February 15, 2025. She reported Staff 1 oversaw\nmedications on shift that night but was unaware that Staff 1 could\nnot get access to the Quick Mar System. Staff 3 reported at one\npoint during the night she went to the cafeteria to grab something\nand when she returned to the unit, Staff 1 had asked Staff 3 to log\na medication for Youth A. She explained that Staff 1 could not get\nher access to work in the Quick Mar system, so she asked Staff 3\nto log that she had provided Youth A two tablets of Ibuprofen.\nStaff 3 reported she did not end up logging the medication and\nasked Staff 2 to do this task when she came onto shift at 5 am.\nShe reported that was when Staff 2 stated Youth A did not have\nIbuprofen approved on his medication list and Nurse was\ncontacted. Staff 3 reported the protocol for passing any\nmedication to a youth is that staff are supposed to check the\ncomputer system for the approved medication before providing\n3",
    "any medication. She reported this is because the youth’s\nmedications are always changing, and it is a safety risk if this is\nnot completed correctly. Staff 3 reported she has never had any\nconcerns about working with Staff 1 and believes this was not an\nintentional error as Staff 1 just wanted to help Youth A feel better.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on February\n18, 2025. Staff 2 reported she worked on February 15, 2025, and\nstarted her shift at 5am. She reported Staff 3 informed her that\nmedication needed to be logged for Youth A as he had a\nheadache overnight. Staff 2 reported she was informed Staff 1\nprovided Youth A two tablets of Ibuprofen overnight which is not\non Youth A’s list of approved medications due to being on Lithium.\nShe reported that she called the on-call Nurse and contacted the\nClinical Supervisor because Youth A was being given a non-\napproved medication. Staff 2 reported Nurse informed her to\nmonitor Youth A’s signs and noted that he did not need further\ntreatment at this time as he was presenting with no concerns.\nWhen asked about the process of providing medication to the\nyouth, Staff 2 reported only medication-trained staff are to pass\nmedications. They are then to log into the Quick Mar computer\nsystem and pull up the youth’s chart. Staff are then to get the\nmedications only listed on the Youth’s Quick Mar list and make\nsure to mark them as given. Staff 2 reported when she talked to\nStaff 1 about this situation, Staff 1 took full responsibility for\npassing the wrong medication. She reported Staff 1 explained she\ncould not get into the Quick Mar System and wanted to help Youth\nA’s headache.\nNurse was interviewed face to face at the facility on February\n18, 2025. Nurse reported she was contacted by Clinical\nSupervisor on February 15, 2025, of Youth A taking a non-\napproved medication. She reported she was informed Youth A\nwas provided Ibuprofen overnight for a headache when he is only\nallowed to have Tylenol. Nurse explained Youth A cannot have\nIbuprofen because he is on Lithium and the Ibuprofen can\nincrease his toxicity levels. She reported due to Youth A just\nhaving a low dose and not showing any concerning symptoms,\nshe directed staff to monitor Youth A for the day and to call if there\nwere any concerns. Nurse reported she did check in on Youth A\nand there were no concerning symptoms. When asked about\nproper medication protocol she reported staff are directed to log in\nto Quick Mar and make sure to double-check the appropriate\nmedications are being provided to the youth. She reported Youth\nA only has Tylenol listed as medication that would help with a\nheadache.\n4",
