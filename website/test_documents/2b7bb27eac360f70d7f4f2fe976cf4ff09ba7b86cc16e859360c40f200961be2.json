CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Best practice regarding child assessment addendum timeframes when there is a\nchange. The CAA is to be completed when there is a change then sent to DHHS\nwithin 5 days. Despite there being no timeframe within policy, this should be\ndone soon after the change in order for DHHS to receive the update timely.\n• Discussion regarding borrowed bed rule changes for after-hours/emergency\nplacements.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The first\nCAP submitted by the agency was in response to special evaluation report\n2022C0112011 dated 6/16/2022. The CAP was approved 6/16/2022 and\naddressed closed adoption files maintained in the agency office past the policy\nrequired timeframe. An on-site inspection on 7/24/2023 confirmed the agency has\nmaintained compliance with that CAP.\nThe second CAP submitted by the agency was in response to the 2022 licensing\nrenewal inspection and was approved on 6/28/2022. That CAP addressed 21\nviolations. Seven of the 21 violations were repeating during this year's inspection.\nIn addition, 3 of the 7 repeated violations have been repeated the past 2\ninspections. One of this year's citation was a repeat from 2021 but not 2022.\nThese violations will require additional corrective action planning. The agency is\nalso found in violation of 4 licensing rule requirements and 1 policy requirement\nthat were not found in violation during the past 2 inspections. The biggest areas of\nconcern with the new citations are regarding visitation with youth and caregivers in\nthe youth's placement. Three of the 6 new violations relate to these face-to-face\ncontacts.\nChief Administrator Assessment\n10",
    "The Chief Administrator assessment accurately identified areas of non-compliance\nfound during this inspection. The Chief Administrator attributed difficulty\nmaintaining compliance to staff turnover, lack of appropriate placements for youth,\nelectronic system barriers, and lack of identified steps needed to ensure continued\ncompliance with previous CAPs.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency's annual financial report was reviewed, and no financial concerns\nwere identified.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed all reported positive experiences at the agency and\nno concerns were identified.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to perform job\nresponsibilities. Case records and physical CHRI are stored in a method that\nprevents unauthorized access through the use of locked cabinets within a locked\nroom.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns were identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJuly 31, 2023\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 31, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"
