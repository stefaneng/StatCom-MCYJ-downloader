    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nChief Administrator Assessment – I reviewed the Chief Administrator Assessment\nwhich indicated that while the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and staff turnover\nand specific staff performance issues made compliance difficult, the CAP submitted\nfollowing the 2020 licensing inspection has had a positive impact resulting in\nimproved compliance overall. The findings of this inspection corroborate the\nassessment, with the addition of concerns related to specific staff performance\nissues that were addressed as timely as possible.\nCHRI - On 7/13/2021 I virtually viewed the storage of the key and the locked storage\narea for CHRI information. I also viewed the dissemination and destruction logs\nstored in this secure area.\nOther Document Review - On 7/13/2021 I reviewed the agency’s organization chart\nand case ratios. While the agency has had a significant staffing changes, they have\nmaintained staffing & case assignment ratios.\nStaff Interviews – The staff reported that there has been regular communication\nand support provided by supervision despite remote work. No concerns were\nidentified during the interviews.\nVII. Analyst Findings\nThe DCWL Analyst identified one safety concern in an unlicensed relative caregiver\nhome.\nSafety Alert: Home did not have a smoke detector located on the second level of the\nhome where the children’s bedrooms were located and the children in the home could\nnot identify a safety plan in case of fire.\nResolution: Photos of installed smoke detectors and completed emergency safety\nplan which was posted on the family’s refrigerator were provided.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n10",
