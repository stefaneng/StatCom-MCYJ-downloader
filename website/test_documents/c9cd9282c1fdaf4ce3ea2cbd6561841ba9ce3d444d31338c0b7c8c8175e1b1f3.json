During that time, Staff 1 member intervened\nby grabbing youth by the neck, picking youth up off the bed by her neck, and putting\nher on the ground. Youth was observed coughing during that time. Youth may have\nbeen choking. Youth did not have any marks or bruises at the time. Management is\naware of the incident.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 05/02/2022 and was investigated jointly with the\nDHHS Specialist.\nI interviewed at the Program Manager onsite in collaboration with DHHS Specialist\non 05/04/2022. She is not aware of any incident involving staff grabbing, choking,\nand putting Youth A on the ground. She reports Youth A has been restraint, but she\nhas no records of Youth A been choked or physically hurt during the restraints. She\nbelieves the allegations are made up from one of two staff members who are no\nlonger working at the facility. She reported one Staff 3 was terminated due to\nattendance. The Staff 4 resigned and did not work the full two weeks, so she didn’t\nget paid and is upset about not getting paid the full two weeks. No staff person had\nreported allegations of staff mistreating or performing an inappropriate restraint on\nYouth A. She did meet with staff several weeks ago about Youth’s A behavior and\nhow to not harbor any feelings toward the youth due to her aggressive behavior\ntowards staff. She reported Youth has not reported any concerns about staff choking\nher. There is two restraint involving Staff 1 and Youth A and they were both done on\n03/11/2022. She provided copies of the restraint reports.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite in collaboration with DHHS Specialist on 05/04/2022.\nYouth A is 17 years old, in the 10th grade, and has been at the facility since\nDecember 2021. She reported that she has been restraint a lot but does not know if\nany of the restraints were done wrong. She said Staff 1 had restrained her two or\nthree times and was too aggressive when she restrained her. She remembers Staff\n1 restrained her in March of 2022 when she classroom. Youth A said the reason she\nwas restrained was because she was hitting the computer keyboard, throwing\nthings, making a lot of noise, and disturbing the class. She said Staff 1 picked her up\n3",
    "and slammed her on the floor. Staff 2 was present during the incident in the\nclassroom. She denied being choked by Staff 1. She was not injured and denied\nbeing examined by the nurse.\nI interviewed Staff 1 onsite in collaboration with DHHS Specialist on 05/04/2022.\nStaff 1 has been working at the facility for 10 years and recently was promoted to\nteam supervisor. She reported Youth A is not currently on her unit. Youth A was\nmoved to another unit because she was having issues with another youth on her\nunit. She recalls several weeks ago she and Staff 2 had to restrain Youth A in the\nclassroom. She reported Youth A was hitting the computer and throwing things, so\nYouth A was placed in a standing restraint which she fought and was placed in a\nteam restraint. She denied Youth A was slammed on the ground or got hurt during\nthe restraint. She said later that same day, Youth A and was arguing with another\nyouth and Staff 3, who is no longer employed at the facility, took Youth A’s water\nbottle. Youth A went after that staff person and Youth A was placed in a team control\nrestraint. Staff 1 denied ever grabbing or choking Youth A. She reported Staff 3 and\n4 no longer work at the facility, and they both had issues with her. She said Staff 3\ncomplained that she was talking to her during work. Staff 4 had issues with Youth\nA’s behavior, so she addressed with her at the Team Meetings. She things that\nthese two staff persons are upset with her and are retaliating by making up these\nallegations.\nI interviewed Staff 2 onsite in collaboration with DHHS Specialist on 05/04/2022,\nStaff 2 has been working at the facility for 7 years and currently Shift Supervisor.\nShe reported Youth A is a like a hurricane and goes from 0 to 100 in a less than a\nminute. She recalls being involved in two restraints involving Youth A couple months\nago but does not recall the specific reason. She said the staff involved never\nslammed or choked Youth A during the restraints. She typically works first shift and\nthe youths are in school, so she does not do a lot of restraints. She denied\nwitnessing Staff 1 slam or choke Youth A. She said she and Staff 1 preformed the\nteam restraint on Youth A. She reported being trained in CPI and no disciplinary\nissues.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Specialist via telephone on 05/19/2022. She\nreported Youth A has extensive behavioral issues and is very aggressive. She is\ncurrently on a wait list to placed in a secured facility. She is not aware of any incident\nwhere Youth A was picked up by her neck, choked, or slammed on the floor.

    "The following documents were reviewed:\n Incident report dated 03/11/2022 at 11:00 AM. Youth A was upset after staff\nfound a straw that had been in her pocket in classroom. She became upset\nand disruptive, yelling and cursing at her peers and began to hit the\ncomputer. An attempt was made to redirect Youth A, but she became\naggressive and started to push staff. Youth A was placed in a standing hold,\nbut she was hitting and pushing staff, so she was placed in a team restraint.\n Incident report dated 03/11/2022 at 3:14 PM. Youth A refused to leave the\nrestroom, so that her peers could use the restroom. Staff attempted to talk to\nYouth A and offered her coping skills, but she did not respond.

Youth\nA fought the intervention and was placed in a team restraint.\n The termination letter for Staff 3 noted she failed to show for two scheduled\nworkdays. She was terminated as of 3/28/2022.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: Based on the interviews of the staff involved the restraints\ntechnique used by staff were safe and appropriate. Youth A\nadmitted to being restrained but denied being choked or hurt\nduring the restraint. One of the staff involved is no longer\nemployed at the facility.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV.
