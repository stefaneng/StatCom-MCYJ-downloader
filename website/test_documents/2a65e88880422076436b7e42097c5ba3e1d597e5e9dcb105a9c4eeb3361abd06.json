Foster\nCare Supervisor stated there are weekly meeting with the team\ninvolved in Youth A’s case, including staff from his current\nplacement, foster care agency staff, West Michigan Partnership\nfor Children (WMPC,) and his behavioral health team to discuss\nneeded supports for his current placement as well as efforts to\nlocate new placement. Foster Care Supervisor stated placement\nsearch has been focused within Kent County to ensure Parent A is\n2",
    "able to visit, but there have been no residential facilities willing to\naccept the youth due to the severity of his needs and no AFC\nhomes willing due to his not turning 18 until October and/or the\nseverity of his needs. Foster Care Supervisor reported Youth A\nwas interviewed for placement in Kalamazoo at a residential\nfacility as a “last resort,” but that facility did not accept Youth A.\nShe stated efforts continue to be made to locate a placement\nwithin Kent County.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via video conferencing on\n6/25/2024 and reported the AFC home where Youth A is currently\nplaced put in a 30-day notice to have him moved, which has\nexpired. She stated the home is willing to allow Youth A to stay\nuntil a new placement is secured. She reported he was\ninterviewed by a facility for placement in Kalamazoo, but that was\na last-ditch effort, and that facility did not accept him. She stated\nthere have been some local AFC homes that will consider\naccepting Youth A after he turns 18 in October, but there are no\ndefinite plans yet.\nBehavior Analyst was interviewed by phone on 6/25/2024. She\nreported Youth A’s current placement gave a 30-day notice to\nhave Youth A moved and Foster Care Worker considered a\nplacement in Kalamazoo. She stated that placement did not\naccept Youth A, but Behavior Analyst is concerned that Foster\nCare Worker is considering placing Youth A too far away from\nParent A for Parent A to continue visiting. Behavior Analyst is also\nconcerned about Youth A potentially being placed out of county\nbecause he has had the same behavioral health team for two\nyears and moving him out of county would result in his loss of that\nteam. Behavior Analyst reported she believed Foster Care Worker\nis making every effort possible to keep Youth A in a local\nplacement.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n• 10/2/2023 Court Order documenting Youth A’s permanency goal\nwas changed to Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement\n(APPLA) and visitation between Youth A and Parent A is at\nagency discretion.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as Complainant, Behavioral\nAnalyst, Foster Care Worker, and Foster Care Supervisor all\nreport Foster Care Worker is making every effort to maintain a\nlocal placement for Youth A.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",

She stated the staff at\nhis current placement have not been able to be as attentive as the\nprevious placement where it was essentially one to one staffing.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated the current placement has recently\nimplemented one to one staffing which has resulted in Youth A’s\nprogress beginning to improve. Foster Care Supervisor stated\nthere are weekly meetings with the team involved in Youth A’s\ncase, including staff from his current placement, foster care\nagency staff, WMPC, and his behavioral health team to discuss\nsupport needed by his current placement as well as to assess the\nservices he is receiving.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via video conferencing on\n6/25/2024 and reported the worker assigned to Youth A’s case at\nthe time of his replacement is no longer with the agency, but\nFoster Care Worker has heard that Youth A’s progress has\ndeclined since being in his previous placement. She stated she\nbelieved some of that was due to Youth A’s tablet being broken so\nhe was not able to communicate. She also stated the placement is\nnow being paid for one-to-one staffing, which Foster Care Worker\nbelieves will be beneficial to Youth A.\nBehavior Analyst was interviewed by phone on 6/25/2024.

Additionally, weekly meetings are\nheld to provide support to the placement and to assess the care\nYouth A is receiving.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Placement\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404\nSection • (4) An agency shall consider all the following factors in\nDescription selecting an appropriate placement for a child:\n• (d) Expressed preferences of the child, and the\nchild's parent or parents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency is not consulting with the parent while searching for\nan appropriate placement for the youth.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant was interviewed by phone on 6/25/2024 and\nreiterated the concerns in the initial complaint.

Complainant was concerned as Parent A only speaks\nSpanish and that worker only spoke English.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing on\n6/25/2024 and reported the worker and supervisor assigned to the\ncase at the time Youth A was moved are no longer with the\nagency and there is a lack of documentation within the record, but\nshe would look through the paper files and documents to see if\nshe can find anything to upload into the case record.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via video conferencing on\n6/25/2024 and reported she was not assigned to the case at the\ntime Youth A was replaced and the worker who was is no longer\nemployed by the agency.

Foster Care Supervisor\nstated she does not know what Parent A was told about bus\naccess, but it is a far walk to the nearest bus stop. Foster Care\nSupervisor reported there was confusion regarding the\ntransportation being utilized by Parent A which likely caused a\ndelay in the previous worker obtaining financial assistance.
