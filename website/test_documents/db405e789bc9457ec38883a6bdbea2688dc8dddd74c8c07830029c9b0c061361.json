INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to\nSection requirements; staff qualifications.\nDescription (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A reported he was raped by Youth B in Youth B's room.\nInvestigation This complaint was received on 5/24/23. The complaint noted the\nfollowing:\nThe Lincoln Center, Spectrum Juvenile Justice Services, is where\nYouth A (14) and Youth B (14) are currently lodged. Yesterday,\n05/22/2023, Youth A entered the bedroom of a peer, Youth B.\nThe two walked in together and walked out together with less than\none minute in Youth B's bedroom. Youth B tried to kiss Youth A,\npull Youth A's pants down. It was also alleged that Youth B raped\nYouth A. There is camera footage of the two boys entering Youth\nB’s room and walking out less than one minute later. Youth\nSpecialist 1 was on the pod at the time they entered and just\nbefore they walked out of the room a different staff entered the\npod. The door of the bedroom was open the entire time the two\nboys were in the room. There has not been a physical\nexamination or a SANE. Youth A is not reporting any pain and he\nhas not requested any medical care. Both minors have been\nadjudicated and have CSC convictions against them, which is the\nreason for their placement at Lincoln Center.\nThe complainant was Lincoln Center's Director. She reported that\nYouth A and B are on Pod G and Youth A reported he was raped\nby Youth B. Youth Specialist 1 was working on the Pod when the\nalleged incident happened. She reported she watched the video\nof the incident, and the youth are in the bedroom for under 1\nminute. The Director reported Youth A's therapist talked with him\nafter he made the allegations, and it was discovered Youth A did\nnot know what rape meant and said he thought it meant when\nsomeone touches you sexually.\nI interviewed Youth A face to face on 5/24/23 at the facility. Youth\nA reported he was forced to enter Youth B's pod as Youth B\nthreatened to \"shank him\" if he didn't do it. Youth A reported that\nYouth Specialist 1 was asleep on the pod and Youth B entered his\nown room and Youth A followed. Youth A reported Youth B\n2",
    "slammed him against the wall, kissed him on the neck and mouth,\npulled his shirt up around his neck, and pulled down his pants and\nsucked his penis \"a couple seconds\". Youth A reported another\nstaff opened the door to the pod and announced a peer that was\nreturning to the pod causing Youth A and Youth B to run out of\nYouth B's room. Youth A reported the staff member did not enter\nthe pod and only let the youth in. Youth A reported he is\nuncomfortable around Youth B and wants moved from the Pod.\nYouth A reported their rooms have been separated on the Pod\nwith one of them being in room 1 and the other in room 9. Youth A\nreported being raped to Supervisor J about hour after the event.\nYouth A was asked if he was raped, and he reported that he\nthought any sexual touching was called rape and denied that\npenetration occurred. Youth A confirmed that he was sexually\ntouched against his will. Youth A is placed at Lincoln Center on\nthe sexual offender Pod and has criminal sexual conduct charges.\nI interviewed Youth B face to face at the facility on 5/24/23. Youth\nB denied he and Youth A were in his room together. Youth B\nreported Youth A is lying about being in his room as he wants off\nthe Pod and doesn't like the youth on the Pod. Youth B denied\nhaving a shank or weapon of any kind and denied threatening to\nshank Youth A. Youth B denied sexually touching or raping Youth\nA. Youth B reported he and Youth A were “in a relationship” from\nJanuary until March and Youth A is upset that Youth B broke up\nwith him. Youth B reported Youth A follows him around the Pod.\nWhen Youth B was told the video was reviewed and he is seen\ngoing into his room and Youth A goes into his room behind him he\ncontinued to deny being in his room with Youth A and said, \"we\nwere not in my room \".\nVIDEO:\nVideo reviewed dated 5/22/23 at 8:57am on Pod G.\n8:57:21 Youth A and B are on the Pod by the showers talking.\nYouth B is putting his arm into his orange jumpsuit and talking to\nYouth A who is behind him.\n8:57: 22 Youth B walks across the pod towards his room with\nYouth A walking a few steps behind him.\n8:57:25 Youth B looks back at Youth Specialist 1 who is sitting in\na chair in front of the control room on the Pod. His head is cocked\nto the side, and he appears to be sleeping or has his eyes closed.\n8:57:29 Youth B enters his room.\n3",
    "8:57:30 Youth A is seen walking slowly across the pod towards\nYouth B's room.\n8:57:31 Youth A stops walking turns his head to check Youth\nSpecialist 1's awareness and then proceeds forward.\n8:57:36 Youth A checks staff's awareness again by turning his\nhead and looking back at Youth Specialist 1.\n8:57:39 Youth A enters Youth B's room.\n8:58:22 Youth B exits his room.\n8:58:26 Youth A exits Youth B's room and is seen hopping/running\nacross the pod behind Youth B.\n8:58:32 Youth C enters the video and stands by his room door\nwaiting to be let into his room.\n8:58:46 Youth Specialist 1 opens Youth C's door and stretches his\narms out wide as if is waking up.\nI interviewed Youth Specialist 1 via the phone on 5/30/23. Youth\nSpecialist 1 reported both Youth A and Youth B were on the Pod\nbecause of ratios at school that day. If a teacher calls off and they\ndon’t have enough teachers, they rotate the youth in and out of\nthe classrooms. The school is not staffed by Lincoln Center they\nhave a charter school who comes in and does it, so they have no\ncontrol over youth needing to be on the pod. Youth Specialist 1\nreported Youth A was goofing around and running in and out of\nother residents' rooms and he instructed him to stop. Youth\nSpecialist 1 reported he never saw Youth A and Youth B enter\nYouth B's room and he does not believe it happened. Youth\nSpecialist 1 denied he was asleep and reported he was having\neye pain that day and that is why his head was cocked to the side\nand he appeared to be sleeping. He reported he had put eye\ndrops in for the pain and that is why he was sitting the way he\nwas.\nI interviewed the facility director face to face at the facility on\n5/24/23. She reported that Youth Specialist 1 has been employed\nwith them for the past 4-5 months and has one write up and a\nsuspension for not keeping line of sight on a resident. There are a\ntotal of 10 residents on Pod G, but all were not present on the Pod\nwhen the incident occurred. The majority of the youth were at\nschool and three residents were on the Pod. There is a 2:10 ratio\non Pod G and Youth Specialist 1 was on the pod and in ratio. The\n4",
    "Director reported the staff and youth seen on video entering the\nPod reported they did not see anything as the staff did not enter\nthe Pod and only announced the resident and then closed the Pod\ndoor.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nEmergency Medical Note dated 5/24/23 from Emergency Room.\nDr. Amy Delaroche saw Youth A for reported sexual assault.\nYouth A reported nonconsensual touching occurred and denied\nany injuries and no penetration sex performed. Youth A’s physical\nexam was benign.\nLincoln Center Unusual Incident Report dated 5/22/23 @ 8:57am.\nAuthored by Facility Manager. Report indicates Youth A reported\nhe was sexually assaulted by Youth B.\nSafety Plan for Youth A and Youth B. Residents will be in\nseparate rooms on opposite sides of the Pod. Residents cannot\ninteract together and will sit apart from one another in school and\nin the dining area. Staff and teachers will ensure Youth A and\nYouth B are not together. If the Pod needs to be split Youth A and\nYouth B will be on separate Pods.\nBoth youth are placed on the sex offender Pod. Their files were\nreviewed and indicate they both have a history of sexual offenses.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews and video there is evidence that supports\nYouth Specialist 1 did not have the ability to perform the duties of\nhis position. Video confirms Youth A and Youth B entered Youth\nB's room while Youth Specialist 1 was on the Pod monitoring\nthem. Youth A reported he was sexually abused by Youth B\nduring that time and that the Youth Specialist was asleep. The\nYouth Specialist does not react or get out of his chair when the\nboys enter Youth B's room. Youth Specialist 1 denies seeing the\nyouth enter the bedroom and indicated he was having eye pain\nthat day. Line of sight was not maintained, and the boys were able\nto enter Youth B’s room for 43 seconds.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTechnical assistance (TA) was provided during special\ninvestigation 20230000450 regarding the resident’s doors needing\nto be locked when youth are not in their rooms. Unlocked room\ndoors interfere with staff’s ability to maintain line of sight of the\nyouth resulting in supervision/safety issues. If that TA had been\nimplemented, this situation would have been avoided.\n5",
