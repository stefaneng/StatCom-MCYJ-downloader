    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(iii)Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or\notherwise suggesting physical or emotional harm to a\nyouth\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 1/29/23, a youth and a staff member engaged in a verbal\nargument in which they threatened to physically assault each\nother.\nInvestigation Youth B was interviewed on 01/31/2023 during an unannounced\nface-to-face visit to the facility. She stated that she had been\ninvolved in an altercation with Staff 1 the Sunday prior. Youth B\nstated that everything occurred during the bedtime portion of the\nevening when youth were getting into bed and supposed to have\n“low tones” and not be speaking. She recalled other youth talking\nand being somewhat disruptive and remembered hearing Staff 1\nstate “I don’t even like this fucking unit” while interacting with the\nother youth. Youth B admitted that she began to sing and talk\nwith other youth when she was not supposed to and stated that\nshe and Staff 1 began to escalate together. Youth B stated that\nshe heard Staff 1 say to her “You ain’t gonna do shit” and “I’ll beat\nyour mother fucking ass” to her. Youth B stated that they both\nthreatened each other as this conversation continued. Youth B\nrecalled getting more and more upset at Staff 1 and admitted to\ncoming at her in an attempt to hurt Staff 1. Youth B stated that\nshe was able to grab on to Staff 1’s hair briefly only to have\nSupervisor 1 intervene between them and attempt to restrain her.\nYouth B recalled Supervisor 1 asking Staff 1 to leave the unit and\nshe did. Youth B recalled the restraint as being “by the book” and\nshe stated that she understood why she was restrained. She\nstated that Supervisor 1 had grabbed her arms right above the\nwrists in and called for Staff 2 to assist and did not attempt to take\nher to the ground. Before Staff 2 could assist, Youth B stated that\nshe was still trying to get to and hit Staff 1 and in doing so she\ntwisted her knee and fell to the ground. It was Youth B’s opinion\nthat this all happened within seconds and that Supervisor 1 didn’t\ndo anything wrong in the process. Youth B stated that Staff 1 was\noutside the unit when she fell and that Supervisor 1 and another\n2",
    "staff she could not remember immediately turned their attention\ntowards helping her up and addressing her knee pain.\nYouth A/Complainant, Youth C, Youth D, Youth E were spoken\nto separately during the same unannounced face-to-face visit to\nthe facility on 01/31/2023. Youth F was spoken to on 02/10/2023\nduring an announced visit to the facility. All five-youth recalled\nsimilar elements of what occurred during the incident between\nYouth B and Staff 1. Each youth believed that Staff 1 could have\nbetter attempted to de-escalate Youth B and antagonized her.\nYouth A stated that she heard Staff 1 state “shut the fuck up\ntalking to me” directed at Youth B. Youth D stated that she heard\nStaff 1 state “I told you to be quiet, but that is what you gonna do,\nshut the fuck up.” She also stated that she heard Staff 1 remark\n“go ahead, go ahead, you ain’t gonna do nothing” in response to\nYouth B threatening Staff 1. Youth F stated that she heard similar\nthings and also heard Staff 1 state that she was going to “beat\nyour ass back” to Youth B before Youth B approached her. All\nfive-youth presented similar recollections of Youth B escalating\nand eventually approaching Staff 1 and attempting to pull Staff 1’s\nhair. They all stated that Supervisor 1 intervened at that point and\nasked Staff 1 to leave the unit in an attempt to de-escalate the\nsituation, which she promptly did.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 02/06/2023. She\nstated that she recalled the incident in question. She believed that\nSunday evening was her first day back at work after some time off\nand that she was assigned to Unit 4 when she normally does not\nwork with them. Staff 1 remarked that she knew that unit of girls\nstruggled greatly and that she had heard the night before went\npoorly and wished she did not have to work in that unit with them.\nStaff 1 recalled several of the youth in the unit being loud at\nbedtime when they were supposed to have “low tones” and be\nquiet. Staff 1 stated that she was trying very hard to take a “light”\ntone when speaking with the youth at that point because “you\nknow what happens when you don’t”, referring to allegations being\nmade against staff any time they challenge youth. Staff 1 stated\nthat at one point she heard Youth B state “We just trying to be bad\ntonight” to another youth. Staff 1 recalled just being repetitive at\nthat point, addressing the youth by asking them not to cuss and\nkeep their tones down when they should not have been talking at\nall. Staff 1 stated that everything began to escalate more at about\n9:30 pm. When addressed further to quiet down Staff 1 stated\nthat Youth B remarked back “Fuck all the staff” and began to raise\nher voice. She then heard Youth B state directly to her “I ain’t\ngonna listen to no bitch.” Staff 1 stated that Supervisor 1 came\n3",
    "into the unit upon her alerting him over walkie talkie at about that\ntime, and then Youth B proceeded to run up to Staff 1 and try to\nattack her. Staff 1 stated that Youth B was able to get her hands\nover Supervisor 1 briefly and try to grab her, but that Supervisor\n1’s intervention and Staff 1 moving backwards allowed this to be\nbrief and largely unsuccessful. Staff 1 stated that Supervisor 1\nhad told her to leave the unit at that point and she did so. She\nstated that she did not witness Youth B’s restraint or any other\ninteractions at that point and for the rest of her shift as she did not\nreturn to that unit. Staff 1 noted several times during the interview\nthat she knew allegations would be coming and that she never\nhad any attitude towards any of the youth that evening. She\ndenied ever threatening Youth B or using any inappropriate\nlanguage of any form.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed over the phone on 03/01/2023. He\nstated that he was present the night of the incident between Youth\nB and Staff 1. Supervisor 1 recalled being alerted to an escalating\nsituation in Youth B’s unit by Staff 1 over the radio and he\nresponded as quickly as he could. As soon as he came into the\nunit he heard Youth B yelling loudly and threatening Staff 1.\nSupervisor 1 stated that he didn't hear Staff 1 say much of\nanything at that point. Very quickly upon entering the unit\nSupervisor 1 had to get in front of an advancing Youth B as she\ntried to attack Staff 1. Supervisor 1 stated that he didn’t believe\nYouth B was able to harm Staff 1 much as he had told Staff 1 to\nleave the unit immediately and she did so. Supervisor 1 recalled\nthat as Staff 1 was leaving he had both of his hands on Youth B’s\nwrists in an attempt to prevent her from getting to Staff 1. At that\ntime he asked Staff 2 to assist him in attempting a standing\nrestraint as they are trained. Supervisor 1 recalled that Youth B\nthen tried to get past him and in doing so she twisted her knee\nand slowly went to the ground. Supervisor 1 stated that this all\nwas pretty much one motion and that as soon as he realized\nYouth B was not attempting to get outside to Staff 1 and that she\nmay be hurt he released his hands of her. At that point Supervisor\n1 stated that Staff 2 was at his side and they started tending to\nYouth B and her knee pain, and she was compliant and calm.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone on 03/07/2023. He stated\nhe entered the unit when Youth B was already escalated and\ndidn’t hear Staff 1 say anything inappropriate when he was\npresent. Staff 1 left the unit shortly after being told to do so by\nSupervisor 1. Staff 2 stated that he was by Supervisor 1’s side as\nhe attempted to prevent Youth B from getting to Staff 1. Staff 2\nrecalled that Supervisor 1 did not fully restrain Youth B, but just\n4",
    "placed his hands on her wrists as she tried to swing at Staff 1.\nStaff 2 stated that he would have assisted in a standing restraint\nbut right at the same time that Supervisor 1 made physical contact\nwith Youth B was when she went to the ground with knee pain and\nstopped resisting staff’s directives.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Therapeutic Crisis Incident Report dated 01/29/2023\nregarding the incident between Youth B and staff. This\nreport contains information consistent with youth and staff\ninterviews in that it states Youth B attempting to get to Staff\n1 and being held back by Supervisor 1 and then injuring her\nknee. It does not contain any narrative about any of the\nverbal interactions that were alleged between Youth B and\nStaff 1.\n• Email communication between facility staff outlining\nmedical attention provided to Youth A on the evening of\n01/29/2023. Over the counter pain medication and ice\nwere provided and instructions to take Youth A to be seen\nfor further medical attention the next day if any pain\ncontinued in the morning or if she could not sleep.\n• Covenant HealthCare documentation dated 01/30/2023\nregarding Youth A’s knee injury. No fractures or dislocation\nnoted and Youth A was provided a knee brace and\ncrutches as a precautionary measure and instructed to\ncontinue using over the counter medication to help with\npain and swelling.\n• Therapeutic Crisis Intervention training materials that are\nused by the facility were reviewed. This is the chosen\nrestraint model for the facility. Staff are trained to attempt a\nstanding restraint as the first physical management\ntechnique, and in doing so the first contact they have with a\nyouth is to “grasp the young person’s arms above their\nwrist with their outside hand.” This method is consistent\nwith what was reported of Supervisor 1’s physical contact\nwith Youth B during the incident in question.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face and phone interviews with staff and youth\nand documentation reviewed, there is evidence to support a\nviolation of the rule due to language used by Staff 1 directed\ntowards Youth B.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4431 Heating equipment.\nSection (1) Heating equipment shall be capable of maintaining a\nDescription temperature of not less than 68 degrees Fahrenheit at a point\n5",
    "4 feet above the floor. An accurate thermometer shall be\nprovided.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth at facility have asked staff to turn air conditioning on instead\nof the heat, but staff turn the heat on in the night instead. Youth\nreport difficulties breathing when heat is on.\nInvestigation The complainant was interviewed on 01/31/2023 during an\nunannounced face-to-face visit to the facility. Youth\nA/Complainant stated that she struggles to breath at night\nbecause the thermostat is turned so high. She knew that it was\nset to 72 degrees because she often heard staff talking about it.\nYouth A stated that she hadn’t heard that the thermostats had\never been turned any higher than that in her time placed at the\nfacility. Youth A was asked if she took any medication or had any\nmedical issues that could contribute to feeling hot at night or the\ndifficulty sleeping, and she remarked that she did not. Youth A\nwas also asked if she was under any sort of safety planning that\nmight affect what items she can have at night and she did not.\nYouth A believed that some, but not all of the other youth in her\nunit had the same concerns as her. Youth A remarked that her\nexperience with the heat had only started recently.\nYouth B, Youth C, Youth D, Youth E were spoken to separately\nduring the same unannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on\n01/31/2023. Youth F was spoken to on 02/10/2023 during an\nannounced visit to the facility. All five-youth had consistent\nresponses to the allegations that the unit was too hot at night to\nsleep and stated that they had not experienced that. All youth\nstated something to the effect of the temperature in the units being\nconsistent at night and that it had not prevented them from\nsleeping. Multiple youth had stated that at times they had safety\nplans in place that caused them to have less or specific blankets\nand that they had felt warm enough sleeping even in the winter\nmonths.\nTherapist was interviewed on 02/10/2023 during an announced\nface-to-face visit to the facility. She stated that the units were\nhaving new locked covers installed over the thermostats in order\nto prevent discord surrounding the temperature in the units, and\nthat supervisors would have the keys to these boxes. One of the\nunits had this already installed and it was viewed.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews of youth and staff there was no\nevidence found of a rule violation regarding the temperature of the\nunits at night.\n6",
