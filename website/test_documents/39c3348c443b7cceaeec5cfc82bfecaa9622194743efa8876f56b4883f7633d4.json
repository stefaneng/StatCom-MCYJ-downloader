    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nOn 8/24/22, Staff 1 failed to follow the facility’s Behavior Management Policy.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face on site at the facility on 8/26/22 in\nconjunction with the MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported the night of the incident\nshe did not want to give the computer back to staff when it was bedtime, and the 2nd\nshift staff were not forcing her to give the computer back. However, when Staff 1\ncame in for 3rd shift, Staff 1 put her stuff down and came right over to Youth A and\ntold her she had to give the computer back. Youth A stated it became escalated very\nquickly because Staff 1 approached her so abruptly and was very demanding. Youth\nA reported Staff 1 entered Youth A’s personal space and Youth A felt Staff 1 was\nimmediately going to become physical with her. Youth A stated she stood up with\nthe computer in hand and then Supervisor and Staff 2 surrounded her on her sides.\nYouth A reported when she stood up, Staff 1 said “Who do you think you are?”. Staff\n1 attempted to grab the computer but failed. Youth A felt since staff were\nsurrounding her, they were going to put their hands on her, so she threw the\ncomputer because she felt she had to defend herself. Youth A stated Supervisor\nwas trying to keep people separated, but she could not remember if Supervisor\nasked Staff 1 to leave. Youth A stated Staff 1 continued to go after her instead of\nwalking away or leaving the home. In the hallway, Youth A reported she was\nhanging onto Staff 1’s hair and called Youth B into the hallway to help her, but Youth\nB ended up helping Youth A calm down instead. Once Youth A was calm, she\nstopped fighting and let go of Staff 1’s hair. Youth A showed she had 3 small bruises\non the underside of the top of her right arm, a bruise on her lower right arm and two\nsmall bruises on the underside of the top of her left arm.\nDirector was interviewed face to face on site at the facility on 8/26/22 in\nconjunction with the MDHHS Worker. Director reported the facility implemented a\nsafety plan due to the nature of the allegations, which includes Staff 1 remaining on\nadministrative leave pending the results of the investigation.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face on site at the facility on 8/26/22 in\nconjunction with the MDHHS Worker. Director was also present. Staff 2\nreported Youth A was not supposed to have a laptop late at night. However, he and\nSupervisor developed a plan to refrain from a power struggle. Instead, they decided\nto let the laptop die and not provide a power strip to charge it. Staff 2 reported Staff 1\ncame in for 3rd shift, did not complete a shift change check in like she was supposed\nto but instead immediately approached Youth A. Staff 1 told Youth A she was not\nsupposed to be on the laptop, got close to Youth A and tried to take the laptop.\nYouth A pushed Staff 1 and they were verbally arguing with each other. Staff 1 got\ncloser to Youth A, Youth A backed up, Staff 1 tried to take the computer again and\nYouth A became more upset and pushed Staff 1 again. Staff 2 reported he and the\nSupervisor were trying to stop the situation, but Staff 1 seemed to be taunting Youth\nA to an extent. Staff 2 and Supervisor positioned themselves on either side of Youth\n5",
    "A in case things became more physical between Youth A and Staff 1. Staff 1 made a\ncomment about Youth A returning home and Youth A spit on Staff 1. Staff 2 stated\nYouth A was continuously asking for Staff 1 to back up and give Youth A space, but\nStaff 1 was not listening. Youth A began punching Staff 1, so Staff 2 attempted to\nrestrain Youth A for a 1:1 hold. The restraint failed because they ran into a couch, so\nStaff 2 disengaged. Staff 2 reported he and Supervisor continued to try and create\nspace between Staff 1 and Youth A by positioning themselves in between them.\nYouth A attempted to attack Staff 1 again, but the Supervisor stood in between, so\nYouth A tried to punch Supervisor. Staff 2 attempted another 1:1 restraint, but Youth\nA turned herself against the couch, so he disengaged. Staff 1 and Staff 2 then\nattempted a Level 1 restraint, which was also not successful, so they disengaged.\nOnce released, Youth A threw a book and a DVD player at Staff 1. Youth A then\nbacked up into the dining room area and Staff 1 continued to approach Youth A.\nYouth A threw a water bottle at Staff 1. Staff 1 still did not back up, so Youth A\ngrabbed a broom and hit Staff 1 with it. The broom broke and Youth A still had part\nof the broom. Staff 1 attempted to take it from her. Youth A grabbed Staff 1’s hair\nand dragged her into the hallway outside of the bedrooms. Youth B was able to calm\nYouth A down, Youth A released Staff 1’s hair and the incident concluded.\nThroughout the interaction, Staff 2 and Supervisor repeatedly asked Staff 1 to leave,\nbut Staff 1 did not respond and did not leave. Staff 2 reported in training they are\ntaught to de-escalate prior to going hands on, but at no point did Staff 1 utilize any\ntechniques to de-escalate the situation.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face on site at the facility on 9/1/22 in\nconjunction with the MDHHS Worker. Director was also present. Staff 3 came in\nfor 3rd shift and Youth A was in the milieu on a laptop. Staff 3 touched base with\nStaff 2 to get an update on what happened during 2nd shift as it is expected staff\nconduct a debrief between shifts. Approximately 20-30 minutes later, Staff 1 came in\nfor 3rd shift. Staff 3 reported she works with Staff 1 often and Staff 1 did not appear\nto be in an abnormal or escalated emotional state when she came in for her shift.\nStaff 3 stated things were calm prior to Staff 1 abruptly approaching Youth A and\nattempting to grab the laptop, which caused the situation to quickly escalate\nafterwards. Staff 3 reported the same series of events noted in Staff 2’s interview.\nHowever, Staff 3 could not remember if anyone asked Staff 1 to leave. Staff 3 stated\nthere were many times Staff 1 could have left, which likely would have de-escalated\nthe situation.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face on site at the facility on 9/1/22 in\nconjunction with the MDHHS Worker. Director was also present. Staff 4’s\ninterview was consistent with Staff 2’s interview, however, Staff 4 was not present\nfor the interaction in the hallway. Staff 4 confirmed Supervisor and Staff 2 were\nasking Staff 1 to back up and/or leave throughout the entire interaction, but Staff 1\nwas not listening. Staff 4 reported there were 3 doors Staff 1 could have exited from,\nwhich were not near Youth A. Staff 4 reported Staff 1 appeared to be instigating the\nsituation and was trying to assert her dominance over Youth A from the beginning.\n6",
    "Supervisor was interviewed via phone on 9/1/22 in conjunction with the\nMDHHS Worker. Director was also present. Supervisor’s interview was consistent\nwith Staff 2’s interview. Supervisor noted she was sitting behind Youth A when Staff\n1 came in for her shift. Supervisor stated Staff 1 came over to Youth A and said,\n“What are you doing with a computer?”. Supervisor told Staff 1 Youth A was doing\nhomework to which Staff 1 chuckled and inappropriately said, “Youth A doing\nhomework? Oh, that’s funny.” Supervisor reported when she continued to tell Staff 1\nto leave the area during the incident, Staff 1 was not listening and never verbally\nresponded to Supervisor’s direction.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face on site at the facility on 9/1/22 in\nconjunction with the MDHHS Worker. Director was also present. Staff 1 stated\nYouth A operates with intimidation, threats and bullying so other staff are afraid to\ntell her no or hold her to the rules, but Staff 1 is not. Staff 1 reported when she came\nin for her shift, she noticed Youth A on the computer in the milieu with Supervisor\nsitting behind Youth A. Staff 1 stated Youth A has previously refused to give up the\nlaptop before bed on two occasions, so it had been decided Youth A would not get a\ncomputer since she could not follow the rules. Staff 1 admitted when Supervisor told\nher Youth A was doing homework, she chuckled. Staff 1 felt Youth A needed to give\nback the laptop immediately because 2nd shift was ending soon and Staff 1 wanted\nthe additional staff support present because she knew it would end up in Youth A\nbeing restrained. Staff 1 stated with Youth A, “you either leave her be or restrain her\nto get her down” and in this situation it would not have worked to “leave her be”.\nStaff 1 reported she attempted to physically take the computer and Youth A punched\nher and spit at her. Staff 1 reported Youth A was still escalated and tried to punch\nstaff, so she and Staff 2 attempted to do a Level 1 restraint but did not communicate\nwell, so it was unsuccessful. Youth A swung a broom at Staff 1 and Staff 1 tried to\nblock it, which broke the broom handle. Staff 1 stated she asked for more support\nsince she knew she was triggering Youth A and staff were not communicating well\nregarding a restraint. Staff 1 stated when she asked for additional support,\nSupervisor replied by saying “More support? Why?”. Staff 1 admitted Supervisor\nasked Staff 1 to leave multiple times, but commented Supervisor is “small and cute”\nand felt Supervisor could not handle the escalated situation since Youth A punched\nSupervisor a couple times. Staff 1 reported she finally left the house after Youth A\nreleased her hair in the hallway after a staff member from Cebelak came over for\nsupport.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage (including sound) of the milieu and hallway of Renucci Home for\n8/24/22 was reviewed on 8/26/22, 9/1/22 and 9/16/22. Although there were two\npoints in the milieu where the camera view was out of range and the hallway was not\nclear due to the camera angle, interviews conducted provided details on what\noccurred at those times. The video was consistent with Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, and\nSupervisor interviews. Staff 1 immediately approached Youth A in an aggressive\nfashion as soon as Staff 1 began her shift. Throughout the video, Staff 1 repeatedly\n7",
    "approached Youth A even after Youth A told Staff 1 to back up and Staff 2 and\nSupervisor were heard telling Staff 1 to leave.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n MiSACWIS Incident Reports (#140590200, 140590201 and 140590202) were\nconsistent with video footage reviewed as well as Supervisor and Staff 2’s\ninterviews.\n Critical Incident/Adverse Event Report Form completed by Staff 1 on 8/25/22.\nThis was consistent with Staff 1’s interview, however additionally Staff 1\nreported “Youth A had spent the evening being belligerent and threatening\nstaff.” Staff 1 came in for her shift on 8/24/22 and did not debrief with staff\nfrom 2nd shift before approaching Youth A, so she would not have known of\nYouth A’s prior behavior.\n St. John’s Restrictive Interventions Procedure (rev. 8/2022). Restrictive\ninterventions will never be used as a form of punishment, discipline or for\nconvenience of staff. Restrictive Interventions are a last resort if less\nrestrictive techniques have been exhausted. Staff must follow Aegis System.\n St. John’s Behavior Management Policy (rev. 1/11/2022). If a youth is in\ncrisis, diversion and de-escalation techniques must be used. Restrictive\nintervention will only be used as a last resort. The use of excessive or\ninappropriate use of restrictive interventions as a form of discipline to gain\ncompliance or for convenience is prohibited.\n Aegis System Manual (2018). Staff are expected to always use the least\nrestrictive option. When approaching an escalated client, staff are to assess\npersonal level of escalation, level of rapport with the client and current non-\nverbal presentation prior to using physical intervention.\n Supervisor’s personnel file was reviewed. Supervisor had one formal written\ndisciplinary action on 12/20/21 for medication passing procedure. Supervisor\ncompleted Aegis Initial Training on 9/15/21. She completed Aegis: Building\nEmpathy training on 2/24/22. She completed Aegis Benevolent Holding Skills\nResidential Team meeting trainings on 9/30/21, 11/11/21, 1/20/22, 4/28/22\nand 9/8/22. She completed Aegis Staff Empowerment Review Team meeting\ntrainings on 2/3/22 and 3/24/22.\n Staff 1’s personnel file was reviewed. Staff 1 has not had any disciplinary\nactions.
