    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms\nof intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing a youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 pushed Youth A during an altercation that occurred on\n07/07/2025.\nInvestigation The complainant was contacted on 07/22/2025 and had no\nfurther information to provide.\nYouth A was interviewed on 08/21/2025 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. She recalled the incident in\nquestion beginning with her walking outside of the facility buildings\nand Staff 1 following her. She recalled picking up some sort of\nlarge pole and walking with it. Youth A intended to put the pole\ndown but felt that Staff 1 was too verbally aggressive in asking her\nto do so. Youth A believed he grabbed the pole from behind her\nand took it from her. Youth A recalled getting upset at this. She\nclimbed on top of a chair that was sitting near a brick wall, and\nYouth A felt Staff 1 tried to pull her down from the chair, causing\nher to fall. Youth A did not recall if she fell to the ground or landed\non her feet when coming off of the chair. Youth A believed that\nwas when she saw a rock on the ground and attempted to pick it\nup only for Staff 1 to stomp on her hand. She recalled Staff 1\nstating that he was going to go get other staff in order to “put her\ndown.” As he stepped away from Youth A, she threw the rock and\nit hit him. Youth A denied aiming at Staff 1. She was unsure what\nimmediately happened to Staff 1 when he was hit by the\nrock. Youth A believed Staff 1 made reference to wanting other\nyouth to come outside and fight Youth A at this point. Youth A\nrecalled Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 4 coming outside at this\npoint. She believed Staff 1 was taken to the hospital. Youth A\nconfirmed law enforcement came to the facility a short time later\nand she was taken into custody because of the assault. She also\nrecalled attempting to punch Staff 1 but did not know when that\noccurred during the incident. Youth A believed Staff 1 pushed her\n2",
    "as a result of her attempting to punch him. Youth A denied being\nby the shed outside and did not recall anything about attempting\nto take nails and self-harm herself. Youth A showed scratches on\nher forearms at the time of the interview, but she was not sure\nwhere they came from. Youth A confirmed there were no other\nyouth or staff outside during the majority of the incident outside.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 08/21/2025 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled being the one-on-one\nstaff for Youth A on the date of the incident. Staff 1 recalled Youth\nA being in a good mood but “doing her own thing” in the afternoon,\nresulting in her walking out of the unit towards the back of the\nfacility. Staff 1 could not recall if Youth A was saying much at this\ntime. He specifically recalled Youth A walking past other youth\nthat were vocally struggling, and she seemed unaffected. He\nfollowed her to provide continued line of sight supervision. As she\nwalked further outside, Youth A began to pick up items that she\nwas finding such as stones on the cement ground and signs that\nwere sitting near a maintenance area of the building. Youth A\npicked up a street sign that was attached to a metal post and\nbegan to swing it around. Staff 1 recalled attempting to take this\nfrom her as he was concerned about her safety and his, and he\nwas able to do so without much resistance. Youth A was then\nbeginning to escalate verbally, stating “Fuck Whaley” and “I am\ngonna kill myself.” At this time Youth A was walking past a\nmaintenance shed and began to attempt to pull loose nails out of\nthe exterior walls of the shed. Staff 1 recalled past incidents\nwhere Youth A had self-harmed before so he felt the need to stay\nclose and attempt to prevent her from picking up anything she\ncould use for self-harm. She was able to do so despite Staff 1\nattempting to prevent her, and she tried to scratch her forearms\nwith the nails. Staff 1 recalled Youth A dropping these as she\ncontinued walking and proceeding to try to pick up rocks on the\nground. He believed she was trying to throw rocks at windows so\nhe was trying to place himself in between Youth A and\nwindows. Staff 1 recalled Youth A getting in front of him and\nbegan a throwing motion to throw the rock at the windows, and he\nwas able to reach from behind Youth A and block the\nthrow. Youth A then attempted to punch Staff 1. As he backed\nup, Staff 1 noticed Youth A reached for the rock on the\nground. Staff 1 recalled diving to pick up the rock, but she was\nable to do so first. He did not believe he and Youth A had any\nphysical contact when this occurred. Staff 1 then got up and\nbacked away from Youth A. She then moved away from him, only\nto turn around and throw the rock back at Staff 1. Staff 1 felt the\nrock hit him in the head. He was not sure if he lost consciousness\n3",
    "or not when this occurred. Staff 1 recalled seeing Staff 2 and Staff\n4 come outside to assist the situation. He did not believe he\ninteracted with Youth A after this occurred but recalled seeing her\ninteract with law enforcement a brief time later. At the time of the\ninterview Staff 1 was aware that Youth A was taken to detention\nfor a short time because of the incident and stated he did not wish\nfor charges to be issued on Youth A. Staff 1 was taken to the\nhospital to treat the head injury caused by Youth A hitting him with\nthe rock. Staff 1 confirmed no other staff or youth were involved in\nthe situation until Staff 2 and Staff 4 came outside. He believed\nother youth came outside and were attempting to fight Youth A at\nthis point in time. Staff 1 denied ever pushing or hitting Youth\nA. He did not understand where the allegation of him pushing her\noff of a chair originated. He recalled Youth A climbing up on top of\na larger electrical box that was located outside, but he believed\nshe had climbed down on her own as he was keeping line of sight\nfrom outside of arm’s reach away. Staff 1 denied any other staff\nhaving to hold him back from Youth A and believed that this was\nmisconstrued from when other staff were assisting him after he\nhad been hit in the head.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 09/12/2025 over the phone. She\nrecalled she looked outside and saw what was occurring. As she\ncame out she saw Youth A standing a distance away from Staff 1\nand Staff 1 was on the ground. She believed Staff 1 was briefly\nunconscious. Staff 2 recalled Youth A being upset, stating Staff 1\ndid not need to be following her. Staff 2 heard Youth A yelling for\nsome time afterwards but did not hear her refer to Staff 1 pushing\nor harming her in any way.\nStaff 3 was interviewed on 09/12/2025 over the phone. She was\ntold to come out to the situation as Staff 1 had been hit with a rock\nby Youth A. When Staff 3 came outside Youth A was hiding in an\nexterior corner and was crying, stating that she did not mean to hit\nStaff 1 with the rock. Other youth had come outside, and the\nsituation was somewhat chaotic. Staff 3 recalled Youth A being\ntaken away by law enforcement a short time later, and Staff 1\nbeing taken to the hospital around the same time. Staff 3 never\nheard Youth A refer to Staff 1 harming her in any way.\nStaff 4 was interviewed on 09/17/2025 over the phone. She\nrecalled seeing the end of the incident unfold. Staff 4 stated she\nsaw Staff 1 be hit in the head by the rock thrown by Youth A as\nshe went outside. Staff 4 approached Youth A initially but then\nturned her attention back to Staff 1 to assist him. She recalled\nStaff 1 being in significant pain. As she did this Staff 4 recalled\n4",
    "seeing Youth A sitting on top of a short brick divider wall\noutside. Youth A commented that she did not know that she had\nhit Staff 1 with the rock and had not intended to do so. Staff 4\nrecalled asking Youth A to get down from the wall and Youth A\nrefused. Staff 4 believed she got down on her own. Staff 4\nrecalled seeing law enforcement arrive quickly and Youth A was\ntaken into custody for the assault. Staff 4 remembered Youth A\nbeing very upset at that time and hearing her state that she was\nsorry for what had occurred.\nFacility Tour:\n• The facility was toured during an announced, face-to-face\nvisit on 08/21/2025. The area where the incident occurred\nwas viewed. The maintenance shed viewed in the video\nhad some small nails on the back wall. There were no\nlarge poles or signs located near areas described in\ninterviews or footage. Small rocks and stones were\nscattered around the unfinished driveway portion of the\narea as well as the open grassy area captured in the video\nfootage.\nVideo reviewed:\n• Security camera footage dated 07/07/2025 at 07:51pm was\nprovided and reviewed. This camera angle was located\noutside of one of the units of the facility and pointed to an\nopen grassy area that was bordered on two sides by the\nbuilding and one side by dumpsters and a maintenance\nshed. Youth A was seen walking around the back side of\nthe shed with Staff 1 trailing behind her. As she reached\ntowards the exterior wall of the shed Staff 1 attempted to\nplace his arms in between and Youth A slapped at\nhim. Staff 1 did not physically react and stood with his\narms crossed. Youth A then attempted to pick up a long\nwooden board from the ground and Staff 1 attempted to\nstop her from doing so by also reaching for the item. Youth\nA then continued to move away from Staff 1 and Staff 1\ntrailed her. Youth A picked up an unidentified item from the\nground and swung her right arm at Staff 1. She then\nattempted to pick up an item again, and Staff 1 attempted\nto stop her by reaching for the same item. Youth A fell to\nthe ground on her left side as this was occurring, with Staff\n1 standing above her and continuing to attempt to grab the\nitem. Staff 1 stepped away from Youth A and she stood up,\nmoving away from Staff 1. Youth A then threw an item at\nStaff 1, and Staff 1 attempted to avoid being hit. It\nappeared that the item hit Staff 1 in the side of his head as\n5",
    "he held his right hand to that side of his head. Youth A\nbacked away from Staff 1 as Staff 1 approached her. She\nheld up her right arm across her chest and Staff 1 grabbed\nthis arm and then released as he got closer. Youth A\nmoved closer to an exterior wall of the facility lined with tall\nwindows with Staff 1 continuing to follow her while holding\nhis right hand to the right side of his head. Youth A picked\nup another item and Staff 1 attempted to retrieve this item\nfrom Youth A by placing his left hand on her lower back and\ngrabbing at it with his right hand. Youth A walked in\nbetween a large electrical box and dumpsters out of view\nwith Staff 1 following her. Youth A and Staff 1 could not be\nseen at this point of the footage.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Facility policy titled “Physical Intervention Policy” was\nprovided and reviewed.
