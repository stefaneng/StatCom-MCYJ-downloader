Staff 1 said he has been\nemployed since March 18, 2024, as a youth care specialist\nworking second shifts. Staff 1 said Saturday started as a “normal\nday” at the beginning of his shift.

Staff 1 said he was told Youth A had\nissues during first shift and had made comments about causing\nissues for second shift staff. Staff 1 said Youth A was outside and\nbecame angry and continued to get more upset but would not talk\nabout why he was angry. Staff 1 said Youth A requested to go\nback to unit 4 and so he was brought inside. Staff 1 said Youth A\nbegan to throw playing cards at Youth B and then picked up a\nthree-ring binder and threw it at Youth B. Staff 1 said Youth B’s\n3",
    "staff took him off unit 4 which upset Youth A and he ran off the unit\nafter Youth B. Staff 1 said Youth B had gone out the back door and\nYouth A followed and started to throw rocks towards Youth B. Staff\n1 said Youth B was able to get into unit 3 with the door secured so\nYouth A was unable to get to him. Staff 1 said Youth A got a brick\nfrom outside and threatened to smash the door if staff would not\nopen it, so they opened the door and let Youth A back into the\nfacility. Staff 1 said Youth A went over to unit 3 door and began to\npound on the door and window screaming at Youth B. Staff 1 said\nYouth A walked into the cafeteria, smashed the drinking fountain\noff the wall, grabbed a metal piece from it, walked to unit 3 door\nand used the metal to break the window out of unit 3 door. Staff 1\nsaid he and Supervisor moved in front of the broken window to\nprevent Youth A from cutting himself on the broken glass or getting\na piece of the glass. Staff 1 said Youth A “grabbed him up” and\nthen let go and walked away. Staff 1 said Youth A attempted to get\nanother piece of metal off the drinking fountain however\nSupervisor stepped on the fountain to prevent him from getting\nanymore pieces. Staff 1 said Youth A then went to the classroom\nand grabbed a speaker with a cord and began to swing it around\nat staff. Staff 1 said Youth A was “uncontrollable” so he “surprise\npunched” Youth A straight on with a closed fist somewhere from\nthe neck up however he was not sure exactly where. Staff 1 said\nhe did not feel he had any other way to control Youth A as he was\nswinging the speaker at staff. Staff 1 said Youth A fell to the\nground and grabbed his leg, so Staff 1 pulled his leg away from\nYouth A and other staff helped move Youth A away from him. Staff\n1 said he then went into the kitchen and Staff 3 and Supervisor\ntook Youth A outside. Staff 1 said he had taken his jacket off\nduring the incident because they are not allowed to restraint with a\nsweatshirt on and he felt they were going to end up restraining\nYouth A. Staff 1 said he was trained to use CPI and never trained\nto punch or hit a youth. Staff 1 said he never witnessed or was a\npart of a restraint at the facility so felt unsure of when he was\nsupposed to initiated a restraint. Staff 1 said he felt confused\nregarding what he was trained and what he actually saw in\npractice on shift, noting that they are trained in restraints but then\ntold not to restrain while on shift. Staff 1 said he was “one hundred\npercent in the wrong and should not have punched him”.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 12,\n2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 2 said on\nSaturday she was working directly with Youth A as one of the staff\nproviding two to one supervision for him. Staff 2 said Staff 1 was\nthe other staff assigned to provide two on one supervision to Youth\nA. Staff 2 said when she arrived to work at 2pm, Youth A was\n4",
    "outside and was having a difficult day. Staff 2 said Youth A was\nupset and making statements about not wanting a two to one staff,\nand that he was going to “beat their assess” referring to the\nsecond shift staff working with him. Staff 2 said Youth A came back\ninside to unit 4 and began to throw playing cards at Youth B. Staff\n2 said Youth B walked away and Youth A then threw a binder at\nYouth B’s head. Staff 2 said Youth B was taken off the unit and\nYouth A ran off the unit to follow him. Youth A saw Youth B in unit\n3, ran back to cafeteria area, broke the water fountain off the wall,\ntook a metal piece and began to hit the window on unit 3 door to\nget to Youth B. Staff 2 said Youth A was able to break the window\nof the door and Staff 1 and Supervisor moved in front of the door\nto prevent Youth A from getting glass or into unit 3. Staff 2 said\nYouth A punched Staff 1 and Supervisor and then walked away\nfrom the unit 3 door. Staff 2 said Youth A went into the cafeteria\nand began trying to get into “stuff”, making threats to “beat [Staff 1]\nass”, telling Staff 1 he hated him and said “fuck you” to Staff 1.\nStaff 2 said Staff 1 was facing Youth A and removed his jacket.\nStaff 2 said she thought Staff 2 had removed his jacket because it\nis against policy to have anything with hoods or strings because it\ncan be dangerous during restraints if a youth pulls the hood over\nstaff’s head or pulls their hoodie strings. Staff 2 was focused on\ntrying to verbally deescalate Youth A when he ran at Staff 1 and\nfell to the ground, stating Youth A “hit the floor hard”. Staff 2 said\nStaff 1 was standing over Youth A repeatedly “pulling up his pants”\nwhich she said gave indication of “fighting” in her experience. Staff\n2 said Staff 1 was making statements such as “I’m not the one”\nand “I don’t give a fuck about my job”. Staff 2 said Youth A got up\nand ran outside and she and Staff 3 followed him. Staff 2 said\noutside Youth A got a brick and threw it at the door which\nshattered. Staff 2 said somehow Youth A found a pen on the\nground and stabbed it into Staff 3’s leg at the same time the police\nand ambulance arrived. Staff 2 said Youth A was then taken to the\nhospital. Staff 2 said she has never seen Staff 1 get upset\npreviously or have concerning interactions with any youth. Staff 2\nsaid staff are not trained to be physically aggressive towards youth\nbut rather to remain professional and focus on deescalating the\nyouth.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 12,\n2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 3 said he\nworked from 2pm until 11:30pm on Saturday and was monitoring\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 while they were interacting with Youth A. Staff 3\nsaid Youth A is on a 2 staff supervision status due to his erratic\nbehaviors including violence and self-harm. Staff 3 said the\ndecision to have Staff 1 as one of the two staff working with Youth\n5",
    "A was because he had worked well with Youth A previously, had\nmore experience than other staff, and had a calm and quiet\npresence. Staff 3 said Youth A was escalated when second shift\narrived and was in and out of the unit with staff following him for a\nshort period of time. Staff 3 said Youth A was upset with Youth C\nwho was placed on unit 3 and was making statements about\nwanting to fight Youth C and going to the unit 3 door yelling\nthreats. Staff 3 said Youth A walked off the unit into the cafeteria,\nknocked the drinking fountain off the wall, took a metal piece off it,\nwent back to unit 3 door and began to use the metal piece to hit\nthe window of the door. Staff 3 said Youth A was able to break the\nwindow out of the door at which time Staff 1 and Supervisor stood\nin front of the door in order to prevent Youth A from getting any of\nthe glass since he has a history of self-harm. Staff 3 said Youth A\npunched Staff 1 in the stomach twice, then punched Supervisor at\nwhich time he initiated a restraint however Youth A immediately\ncalmed down and walked away so he disengaged the hold. Staff 3\nsaid Youth A walked into a school classroom, grabbed a speaker\noff the desk that had a cord and began swinging it around by the\ncord like “a helicopter”. Staff 3 said Youth A was threatening to hit\nstaff with the speaker therefore staff stepped back and Youth A\nwalked into the cafeteria. Staff 3 said Youth A said “I’m going to\nfuck you up” to Staff 1, at which time Staff 1 took off his jacket and\nsaid “I’m not the one”. Staff 3 said his impression of Staff 1\nremoving his coat was due to getting ready to go into a restraint\nand staff are not supposed to restrain with hoodies as it could be\npulled over his head and would be unsafe. Staff 3 said his\ninterpretation of Staff 1 saying “I’m not the one” was him making it\nknown to Youth A he is not afraid to restrain him if needed. Staff 3\nsaid he was standing to the side of Youth A and Youth A was\nfocused on Staff 1 so he took the opportunity to lean forward and\ngrab the speaker from Youth A and then threw it into a storage\narea right behind him. Staff 3 said when he looked up Youth A was\nhitting Staff 1 and then fell backward onto the ground. Staff 3 said\nhe did not see Staff 1 hit Youth A. Staff 3 said Youth A’s legs went\ninto the air and Staff 1 grabbed Youth A’s leg and was not letting\ngo. Staff 3 said he told Staff 1 to let go of Youth A’s legs and then\npeeled Staff 1’s fingers off Youth A’s leg and Supervisor told Staff\n1 to go into the kitchen. Staff 3 said Youth A went outside and he\nfollowed him. Staff 3 said Youth A was making the statement “he\nhit me” and Staff 3 said Youth A’s lip was bleeding. Staff 3 said\nYouth A was very angry and grabbed bricks and broke the front\ndoor. Staff 3 said he took Youth A’s right hand to prevent him from\ngrabbing glass from the door and Youth A grabbed a pen off the\nground and stabbed him in the leg at the same time police and\nambulance arrived. Staff 3 said Youth A was then taken to the\n6",
    "hospital. Staff 3 said the EMS treated him for being stabbed by the\npen and it breaking off in his leg. Staff 3 said he has never seen or\nheard of any issues with Staff 1 previously. Staff 3 said staff are\nnot trained to use physical violence in working with youth.\nCook was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 12,\n2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Cook said Youth A\nwas upset on Saturday and came into the cafeteria and “grabbed\nthe drinking fountain off the wall”. Cook said Supervisor put her\nfoot on the drinking fountain to prevent Youth A from picking it up\nat which time Youth A punched Supervisor in the face, grabbed a\nmetal piece and ran down the hallway. Cook said she took care of\nall the tables, chairs, and salad bar. Cook said Youth A returned to\nthe cafeteria with speaker on a cord and was spinning it around in\nthe air. Cook said one of the staff was able to get the speaker\naway from Youth A and at the same time she heard Supervisor yell\n“stop”. Cook said Staff 1 took off his coat, went up to Youth A and\npunched him in the face. Cook said Supervisor pulled Staff 1 aside\nand held him back from Youth A. Cook said Supervisor kept\nsaying “no, no” to Staff 1 and then she opened her kitchen door\nand told Staff 1 “get your ass in here”. Cook said Staff 1 came into\nthe kitchen and she could tell his adrenaline was very high, so she\nhad him sit down and she gave him a drink. Cook said Staff 1\nbegan to calm down and made the statement “I can’t stand to\nwatch anyone punch a woman” and “now I might not be able to\nsee my kids”. Cook said she has seen Staff 1 working with the\nyouth on occasion and he is usually very “laid back and quiet”.\nSupervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nJune 12, 2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker.\nSupervisor said she worked Saturday from 2pm until 6pm.\nSupervisor said when she arrived Youth A was outside and upset\nmaking self-harm statements and threatening to beat up second\nshift staff. Supervisor said Youth A was irritated and pacing around\nthe unit however refused to talk to any staff. Supervisor said Youth\nA was on the unit with Youth B and staff asked if they wanted to\nplay cards and Youth A said yes, then took the cards and began to\nthrow them at Youth B. Supervisor said Youth B did not react so\nYouth A grabbed more cards and continued to throw them at Youth\nB. Supervisor said Youth B was taken off the unit and Youth A\nchased him and attempted to punch Youth B. Supervisor said\nYouth B was able to get into unit 3 with the door locked and Youth\nA stood at the door pounding and screaming at Youth C.\nSupervisor said she and Staff 1 stood in front of the door and\nYouth A pushed her and then walked into the cafeteria.

Supervisor said she called for staff to place Youth A in a\nrestraint and Staff 1 and Staff 3 attempted but let go because\nYouth A got loose and walked away. Supervisor said Youth A went\ninto a classroom and destroyed a computer and then grabbed the\nspeakers that were attached to the computer and began to swing\nthem around over his head. Supervisor said everyone stepped\nback at that point to prevent getting hit. Supervisor said Youth A\nwalked back into the cafeteria and began swinging the speaker\nand walked towards Staff 1. Supervisor said Staff 3 grabbed the\nspeaker from Youth A as he was not looking in his direction.\nSupervisor said Staff 1 took off his coat and said, “I’m a grown ass\nman, you’re not going to put your hands on me”. Supervisor said\nshe immediately ran towards Staff 1 intending to intervene\nhowever Youth A fell backwards and hit the floor yelling that Staff 1\nhad hit him before she got to them. Supervisor said she did not\nsee Staff 1 punch Youth A but did see Staff 1’s arm go straight out\nin a punching motion in front of him. Supervisor said she sent Staff\n1 into the kitchen while she, Staff 2, and Staff 3 took Youth A\noutside. Supervisor said Youth A continued to be upset and was\nthrowing bricks at the door and shattered the front door.\nSupervisor said Youth A found a pen on the ground and stabbed\nStaff 3 in the leg at the same time the police and EMS arrived.\nSupervisor said Youth A saw the police and fell to the ground and\nthen was transported to the hospital by EMS.
