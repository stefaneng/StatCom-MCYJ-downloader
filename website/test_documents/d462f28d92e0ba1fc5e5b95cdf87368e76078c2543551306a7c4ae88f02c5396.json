Supervisor 1\nstated she never made a comment to Youth A or Youth C about\nthem being white and their hair texture. She stated she\ncompliments their hair all the time and nothing further. She stated\nshe only said to them that if they get braids, they will only be able\nto go once a month and to pick a hairstyle they can get their hair\ndone twice a month instead.\nStaff 4 was interviewed over the phone at the facility in\ncollaboration with MDHHS on 8/14/2025.

After being informed\nof the information from Staff Senior, writer expressed\nwillingness to address Youth A’s behavior due to positive\nrelationship with both peers. When writer approached the\ndining hall, Youth A was seated and eating. Writer informed\nher of the report and explained the importance of treating\npeers particularly those with lower cognitive functioning\nabilities with respect and protection rather than bullying.\nInitially, Youth A appeared excited by the attention and\nmentioning of her being involved in a physical altercation.\nWriter attempted to redirect Youth A by reflecting on her\npast experiences with bullying. Youth A responded by\nclarifying that she planned to attack Youth E, not anyone\nelse. Writer asked if she had enjoyed being targeted and\nmistreated by peers in the past. However, upon mention of\nher past experiences with being bullied Youth A became\ndefensive and stated that she did not care and still intended\nto fight Youth E. Despite multiple efforts to de-escalate the\nsituation, Youth A continued to make verbal threats. Writer\ncautioned her that if she initiated a fight, other residents\nsuch as Youth D and Youth B might also become involved.\nAt this point, Youth A became irate, abruptly jumped from\nher seat, and directed threats toward writer, stating she\nintended to assault writer. Youth A further verbalized that\nno other residents could touch her, claiming that such\nactions would constitute child abuse. For safety, writer\nmoved behind the counter. Youth A then grabbed a bowl,\nheld it over her head in a threatening manner, and a “clear”\nwas immediately called by Staff 6. Approximately six\nseconds later, Youth A attempted to strike writer with the\nbowl but missed. When she bent over in attempt to retrieve\nthe bowl again, writer used a knee to knock it from her\ngrasp and simultaneously called for team assistance. Writer\n17",
    "and Staff 6 initiated a high-level standing restraint. During\nthe restraint, Youth A engaged in aggressive behaviors,\nincluding spitting, scratching, and continuing to make verbal\nthreats toward staff. She was counseled and encouraged to\ncalm down in order to be released from the restraint;\nhowever, her aggression persisted even as additional staff\narrived to assist. When Supervisor 2 entered the dining\nhall, writer was advised to disengage causing Youth A and\nStaff 6 to fall to the ground. Upon release, Youth A\nimmediately attempted to swing and kick at writer. Other\nstaff members intervened, creating space between Youth A\nand writer, which allowed writer to safely exit the dining hall\nwithout further incident.\nAnalysis Allegation 1:\nThe agency is found in compliance as there was insufficient\nevidence to support a rule violation of Staff 1 telling Youth A to “go\nin her room and kill herself”.\nAllegation 2:\nThe agency is found in compliance per staff interviews as there is\ninsufficient evidence to support that Staff 1 threatened Youth A.\nTechnical Assistance\nTechnical assistance was provided regarding ratio requirements.\nAlthough Staff 1 denied being out of ratio, she did indicate the\nfacility is allowed to be out of ratio during crisis situations. There\nare no exceptions to being out of ratio and if a facility is out of ratio\nregardless of the reasoning, this would result in a rule violation. All\nstaff should be trained on ratio requirements to ensure this is well\nknown to all staff.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n18",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings, the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n____________________10/07/2025\nBrittany Cowans Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/13/2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n19"
