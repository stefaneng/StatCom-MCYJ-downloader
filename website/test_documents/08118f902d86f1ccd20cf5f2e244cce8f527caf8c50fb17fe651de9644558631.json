The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules\nexcept for the following:\nR 400.12205 Required staff.\n(5) An agency shall appoint a social service worker who\npossesses at least a bachelor's degree from an accredited\ncollege or university with a major in a human behavioral\nscience, or in another major where 25% of the course credits\nearned toward the degree are in human behavioral sciences.\nOne of ten new, promoted or transferred social service\nworkers did not possess a bachelor’s degree with a major\nin a human behavioral science or 25% of course credits\nearned in human behavioral science.\nThe employee was hired as a foster care worker on 8/31/20\nand recently completed CWTI training.

When the error was\ndiscovered, they were unable to remove the rule due to\nMISACWIS limitations.\nR 400.12404 Placement.\n(7) An agency shall document, in the child's record, within 7\ncalendar days after placement, the information specified in R\n400.12417(1) and all of the following information:\n(a) – (g)\nWhen cases of two of eight children were transferred to\nVista Maria from another agency, placement outlines/client\ninformation forms were not completed.\n(repeat violation from 2019)\n5",

    "R 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nAn agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and parenting\ntime that contains, at a minimum, all of the following:\n(b) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster child\nand the foster parent in the foster parent's home at least once\nevery month.\nOne of eight foster children was not visited by the social\nservice worker in the foster parent’s home either in person\nor virtually in March 2020.\nR 400.12509 Independent living record.\n(3) The case record shall contain all of the following information\nand documentation, which shall be recorded within 30 calendar\ndays after placement in independent living and updated at least\nonce every 90 calendar days:\n(o) Service plans as required in R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420\nOne of three IL youth’s updated service plans was 5 days\nlate\n2.) The facility is in compliance will all additional ISEP requirements except the following:\nISEP 6.49 Quarterly medical passports\nOne quarterly medical passport was missing for one of eight\nfoster children\n7",
    "ISEP 6.30 Supervisory oversight\nThere was no documentation that the foster care worker for one\nof eight children received supervision in Jan or Feb 2020.\n3.) The facility is in compliance will all MDDHS Contract/Policy requirements\nexcept the following:\nSRM 103 pg 2 - 5 Staff qualifications and training\nEight of eleven staff with access to CHRI did not have SAT\ntraining within 6 months of hire/position change or were not\nrecertified every two years\nSRM 103 pg 13 Training\nTwo of four IL caseworkers did not complete or it could not be\ndetermined if they completed 32 hours of training in 2019.\nFOM 802 pg 1 Mental health screening within 30 days\nOne of eight foster children did not have an ASQ or PSC\ncompleted within 30 days of placement.\n(repeat non-compliance)\nDHHS 722-08C Required participation\nEight of 25 PATPs did not have the birth parent’s or child 14+\nsignature verifying participation in the plan\n(repeat non-compliance)\nDHHS 722-08C Required participation\nEight of 25 PATPs did not have the foster parent’s signature\nverifying participation in the plan\n8",
    "(repeat non-compliance)\nDHHS 722-06B Quarterly FTMs\nTwo of eleven - One foster child and one IL youth did not have\nan FTM during one quarter.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR 400.12326 Borrowed home – upon receiving annual/renewal reports and\nspecial evaluations from the licensing agency, it is\nrecommended the licensing supervisor date and initial the\nreports as verification they are acceptable.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nThe agency was unable to locate a current foster child’s hard paper file. They\nindicated it may be with the child’s former foster care worker who resigned. This\npresents a potential confidentiality breach. I recommend the agency continue\nto search for the file and compile a duplicate file using uploaded information until the\noriginal file is located.\nA foster care supervisor said she typed a birth father’s signature on a PATP in\nSeptember 2020 without giving him a copy of the document after COVID home\nvisit restrictions had lifted. The same supervisor acknowledged the birth mother was\nunreachable, yet she typed the mother’s signature on the PATP anyway. Both\nsignatures were typed in by the supervisor on the same day the report was\ncompleted. *Note – birth parent/caregiver signatures are not required on PATPs\nuntil 30 days after the report is completed. The foster child lives with the father and\nin-person home visits had resumed by September. The supervisor could have asked\nfor the father’s signature at the next home visit and could have written on the\nmother’s copy of the PATP that she could not be located. If virtual contacts become\nnecessary in the future, I recommend emailing the PATP to the relevant parties,\nrequesting a return email confirming agreement and uploading the email with\nthe corresponding PATP. If the person does not have email, the PATP could be\nmailed, date stamped and returned. Other methods of confirming agreement with\nthe plan can also be used as long as verification is uploaded with the PATP.\nIncomplete and/or unsigned documents should not be uploaded into MISACWIS.\n9",
    "The Pediatric Symptom Checklist has no date or signature line. I recommend PSCs\nbe signed and dated by the foster care worker somewhere on the page in order to\ndetermine when it was completed and by whom.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one safety alert in a foster home as determined by the DCWL Analyst\non 11/4/20. Concern: The foster parent told the analyst she did not have a child’s\nmedical authorization card. Resolution: She later confirmed to the agency that\nshe had had the card all along.\nDuring this licensing period, there was one incident of substantiated child abuse\ninvolving corporal punishment by a foster parent. In this instance, a special\nevaluation was completed and the agency recommended that foster home license\nbe revoked.\nThere were no DCWL investigations on the agency during this licensing period.\nThe following were rules and policies cited and acceptable corrective action\nplans submitted for the Interim Inspection of 2019:\nR 400.12324 (8) Reevaluation\nR 400.12325 (1) License recommendation\nR 400.12404 (7) (a) – (g) Placement\nR 400.12405 (3) (a) – (j) Change of placement\nR 400.12413 (1) ( c) (ii) Medical and dental care policy\nR 400.12417 (1) (a) – (j) Foster parent information\nR 400.12418 (2) (a) Development of service plans (late ISP)\nR 400.12504 (2) ( c) Eligibility requirements (Independent living)\nR 400.12505 (2) (b) Supervision\nR 400.12510 1 (a) – (d) Independent living contract\nISEP 6.43 Mental health screening\nISEP 6.33 Child over 14+ involvement\nFOM 722-08C Caregiver’s signatures on PATP\nFOM 722-06I Monthly sibling visits\nADM 330 Quarterly Adoption Progress reports (timely)\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MSA requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\n10",
    "acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\nNovember 20, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 3, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
