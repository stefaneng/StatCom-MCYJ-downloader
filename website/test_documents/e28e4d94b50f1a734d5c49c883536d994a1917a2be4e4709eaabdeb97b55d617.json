EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\n5",
    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows.\nThe CAP, approved 1/12/23, was the result of the 12/15/22 renewal evaluation.\nDuring the 2022 review, twelve licensing rule and DHHS policy violations were\nfound. The agency reported successful implementation of their CAP over the past\nyear. Although there has been some staffing changes, which may have affected\nfull compliance. As of the current review thirteen violations were found. Three of\nthose violations were repeat violations from the 2022 review. However, it was\nnoted that each repeat had fewer instances of missing or late information than the\nprevious year.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed. During this\npast year the agency has made effort to inform foster parents of the new licensing\nrules and ensure they are in compliance. The agency has also focused on\nengagement with families and foster families to improve services. The agency\ncontinues to see a high number of children coming in to care, with placements with\nrelatives increasing. This relative engagement and follow-up for licensure has\nincreased responsibilities for licensing and foster care staff. The agency also\ncontinues to have difficulty locating non-relative placements, due to the ongoing\nstate-wide placement crisis. The agency reports staffing to be steady at this time,\nalthough there has been turnover which creates a lag in some work due to the\ntime needed to train new staff. Despite these challenges, the agency has\ncontinued working diligently on their CAP throughout this review period. The\nagency noted positive outcomes from the CAP as well as some areas where\nimprovement is needed.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A as local MDHHS office.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. One staff was new to the agency and reported\nfeeling very supported by her supervisor. The staff stated there is great teamwork\nand collaboration at the agency and guidance when needed to keep everyone\ninformed. The staff did not have any suggestions for improvement at the agency.\nThe second staff has been with the agency for a few years. The staff reported their\nsupervisor is supportive, on top of everything, and very organized. The staff did\nnot have any concerns about the agency, but indicated they would benefit from\nmore service providers in the area. Staff also indicated case aids to help transport\nand act as parenting coaches would be nice to have.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\n6",
    "The agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2022 review. The\nbuilding is located in downtown Jackson, MI. The building has sufficient space for\nstaff and clients. There is adequate locked storage for confidential information\nincluding CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: The unlicensed relative home did not have any working smoke or\ncarbon monoxide detectors. Medications were not stored safely.\nResolution: The agency provided the family with a lock box for medication. Agency\nstaff verified the medication was properly stored in the lock box on 11/2/23. The\nagency provided the home with combination smoke/carbon monoxide detectors for\neach level of the home. The detectors were installed and tested on 11/2/23.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_ ___________December 20, 2023_______________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 5, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
