    "05/04/2021 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\n05/07/2021 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION: It is alleged that a foster family was not provided with\ntravel and clothing reimbursement.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the following documents throughout the course of the investigation:\n Case Service Plan dated 11/17/20-2/13/21\n Social Work Contacts\n Emails from Foster family to agency\n DHHS policy FOM 903-9\n DHHS policy FOM 723\nOn 4/23/21, I spoke to Administrator 1. Administrator 1 reported she did not have all the\ndetails but did provide the names of who to contact. Administrator 1 did report FC\nWorker 1 may not have known all of the policies pertaining to reimbursement.\nDetails:\nFoster Child 1 DOB: 5/7/14\nPlacement Date: 1/22/21\nRemoval Date: 3/4/21\nOn 4/23/21, I left a voicemail for Complainant 1.\nOn 4/27/21, I interviewed Complainant 1 via telephone. Complainant 1 reported they\nhad placement of Foster Child A on 1/22/21. Complainant 1 reported they live in\nCaseville school districts. Foster Child A was to attend school outside of their district in\nBad Axe school district. Complainant 1 reported they called “TAT” Thumb Area Transit\nfor transportation for Foster Child A to get to and from school. TAT did not have a pick\nup at their home, but would pick up Foster Child A at 6:00am at a pick up point in\nPigeon, Michigan. Complainant 1 reported school doesn’t start until 8am. Complainant\nA reported this was not realistic plan to wake up Foster Child A at 5:00am to drop him\noff at 6:00am to be placed on a bus for two hours. Due to this only option in\ntransportation, Complainant 1 reported to Foster Care Worker 1 that they would\ntransport. Complainant 1 reported Foster Care Worker 1 told them they would be\nreimbursed. Foster Care Worker 1 showed them how to do the expense sheet and\nstated she would get the google maps to help. Complainant 1 reported it was never an\noption to take Foster Child A to a school in their district. Complainant 1 reported they\n4",
    "asked this and was told by Foster Care Worker 1 that a court order would need to be\ncompleted to allow a school change. Complainant 1 reported they did not receive\nreimbursement for clothing as well. Complainant 1 reported Foster Child A did not come\nwith much clothes. They then bought items and turned in the receipts. Complainant 1\nreported they turned in an expense report on 2/25/21 for $1018 and on 3/3/21 for $200.\nOn 3/9/21, Complainant 1 reported he called Foster Care Worker 1 on 3/9/21 and\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported she had not yet submitted the expense request due to\nbeing busy with other items. Complainant 1 reported he attempted phone calls to Foster\nCare Worker 1 after this phone call, but no one returned his phone calls. Complainant 1\nreported after he filed a complainant the agency told him that he would be reimbursed\nfor half of the costs, but not the clothing or transportation to the school. Complainant 1\nreported he was told he would not receiving clothing reimbursement because they had\ngone to a thrift store and had a receipt that was not itemized. Complainant 1 reported he\nwas told he would not get transportation to school reimbursement because the court\nneeded to order that.\nEmail from Complainant 1 to FCW 1 dated 3/9/21:\nHi [FCW 1] this is [Complainant 1] do you know how long to get expense check I\nspent a lot on gas and for the bills today. I see the monthly check in system.\nThank you.\nResponse from FCW1 to Complainant 1 dated 3/9/21:\nIt will likely take a couple weeks to be processed.\nEmail from Complainant 1 to Foster Care Worker 1 dated 4/16/21:\n[FCW1] this is [Complainant 1] you replied to this on 3/9 telling me two weeks to\nget my money it is now 4/16 and I see nothing done yet. I have been more than\npatient but I need my money. This does not come out of your pocket and was\ntold me if I transported Foster Child A I would be paid…If this is not handles\nASAP I would like to know the chain of command so I can talk to them. Sorry to\nbe this way but foster parents should be treated better.\nThere was no response email to the above email.\nOno 4/19/21, Complainant 1 emailed Administrator 2 requesting the same\nreimbursement money from above. Administrator 2 emailed back on 4/20/21 and\nreported the payments have been put into the system. Later on 4/20/21, Administrator 2\nreported that $609.09 would be reimbursed but the school travel reimbursement will not.\nAdministrator 2 reported “However the only way for school transportation to be paid is\nfor the court to order that-the foster parent transport the child and be reimbursed which\ndid not occur in this case.”\n5",
    "I interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 on 5/4/21. Foster Care Worker 1 reported Foster\nChild A was to attend a school outside of the foster parent’s school district. Foster\nWorker 1 reported she told the foster parents they could switch schools for Foster Child\nA if they would like and they refused doing that. Foster Worker 1 did report she tried to\nfile a Determination of Care within the first 30 days of placement. Foster Care Worker 1\nreported she was attempting to obtain school transportation costs for the family. Foster\nCare Worker 1 reported Complainant 1 was aware she was trying to obtain travel\nreimbursement for school transportation. Foster Care Worker 1 reported her supervisor\ntold her to remove that request and reach out to the school for transportation. Foster\nCare Worker 1 reported this was when she called the school and they referred TAT.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported she was not sure on all the processes and policies for\ntransportation and clothing.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported she called the school and the school provided\nComplainant 1 with “TAT”. Foster Care Worker 1 reported she was told by Complainant\n1 that Foster Child A would have to get up early and be at the bus stop at 6:00am to be\nat school at 8:00am. Foster Worker 1 reported Foster Child A would have to wait a half\nhour after school as well. Foster Care Worker 1 reported she did try to help\nComplainant 1 with the mileage reimbursement expense sheet. Foster Care Worker 1\nreported she did print off google maps from the house to the school and then school to\nDHHS building, but only for parenting visits when Complainant 1 had to pick up Foster\nChild A to go to parenting time. Foster Care Worker reported there are no case notes\ndocumenting approval for Complainant 1 to change schools for Foster A. Foster Care\nWorker 1 reported she did not document this in the initial Family team Meeting (FTM).\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported there was a total of $19.10 in clothing reimbursement\nthat was provided to Complainant 1. Foster Care Woker 1 reported $29.15 was not\nreimbursed due to them not having an itemized receipt. Foster Care Woker 1 reported\nshe did tell Complainant 1 to buy clothing for Foster Child A. Foster Care Worker 1\nreported she does not have a DHHS 3377, clothing inventory to show this consultant.\nCase Service Plan dated 11/17/20-2/13/21\nThere was no information documenting the Complainant could alter the school Foster\nChild A was attending.\nSocial Work Contacts from 1/22/21-3/4/21:\nThere are no social work contacts (phone, email, in person) that document\nconversations pertaining to transportation or change of school.\nI was unable to review a DHS 3377 to verify thee amount of clothing Foster Child A had\nwhen placed.\nI reviewed DHHS Policy FOM 903-9:\n6",
    "If it is determined that it is in the child’s best interest to remain in the school\ndistrict of origin despite being placed in a foster home outside of the school\ndistrict, there may be an additional cost for transportation. MDHHS and the\nschool district can assist with this cost. Transportation should be set up in\ncollaboration with the school district foster care liaison and the caregiver to\nidentify the most cost-effective plan. Options for transportation include, but are\nnot limited to:\n Gas reimbursement to foster parent or volunteer driver.\nThe cost for transportation to the school of origin may be paid as follows:\n For a child who is in a Title IV-E funded placement, MDHHS\nwill pay the entire transportation expense.\n For a child who is in a non-Title IV-E funded placement,\nMDHHS and the school district of origin split the cost 50/50.\n Local school districts and MDHHS staff may also collaborate to\nagree on other payment options.\nI reviewed the DHHS policy FOM 903-09:\nA DHS-3377, Clothing Inventory Checklist, must be completed within the first 30\ncalendar days of every placement and again at every placement change. The\nworker must make every effort to obtain available clothing from the child's own\nhome or previous placement. Clothing payments are only to be made to\nproviders who are also receiving maintenance payments.\nInitial Clothing Payment\nInitial clothing payments supplement a child's existing wardrobe and is not an\nautomatic allowance for every child entering care. The DHS-3377 must be\ncompleted, uploaded to the documents hyperlink on the service authorization,\nand filed in the child's case file to document need.\nI reviewed the Foster Parent Orientation Manual signed by Complainant 1:\nClothing Policy:\nAn initial clothing allowance may be available when a child first enters care for foster\nplacement. A semi-annual clothing allowance occurs twice a year. The Clothing\nInventory Checklist (BRS 3377) should be used as a guideline in determining basic\n(minimal) clothing needs.\nThe schedule of foster care rates designates a portion of the daily rate for the purchase\n7",
    "of clothing for foster children. Foster parents and the agency shall ensure that each\nfoster child has a sufficient amount of clothing that is size and season appropriate and\nin good repair…\nTransportation Policy:\nRoutine transportation which parents would normally provide for their child, (e.g.,\nmedical/dental appointments, school conferences, etc.) is covered in the age-\nappropriate per diem reimbursement rate. No additional reimbursement is available.\nExtraordinary transportation provided for the child, such as special long distance\nmedical appointments, is reimbursable upon discussion with the Huron County\nDepartment of Health and Human Services worker for preauthorization.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12402 Program statement.\nProgram statement. An agency shall have and follow a\ncurrent written program statement that includes all of the\nfollowing information:\n(c) Types of services provided to foster children and\ntheir families.\n8",
    "ANALYSIS: Complainant 1 did not receive reimbursement for transportation\ncosts to and from school. Foster Child A attended a school\noutside of Complainant 1’s school district. According to DHHS\npolicy, transportation reimbursement is to be provided in this\nsituation. According to the Foster Parent Orientation Manuel\nsigned by Complainant 1, this will fall under “extraordinary\ntransportation”.\nAlthough TAT was contacted to provide transportation, this\ntransportation service was not realistic or in the best interest of\nFoster Child A. This transportation would have resulted in Foster\nChild A waking up early to catch a 6:00am bus when school did\nnot start until 8:00am. This would also result in Foster Child A\nwaiting 30 minutes after school to be transported.\nComplainant 1 was not reimbursed for clothing that was bought\nfor Foster Child A. Neither the DHHS policy nor the Foster\nFamily Manual report a receipt is needed for reimbursement of\nclothing. Complainant 1 did provide a receipt although it was not\nneeded. DHHS policy requires a DHHS 3377 to be completed\nand provided for reimbursement, although one was not\ncompleted and Complainant 1 was reimbursed for some clothing\nmoney.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nA. It is recommended that the license remain unchanged.\n5/4/21\n________________________________________\nVenus M. Decker Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n9",
