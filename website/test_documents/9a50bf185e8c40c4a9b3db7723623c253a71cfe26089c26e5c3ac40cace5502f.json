    "ALLEGATION:\nMaple Lodge had given a 30-day notice that they would like Youth A moved from\ntheir program and the 30-day expiration date is 8/13/2021. Youth A had to be taken\nto the hospital as she was having suicidal thoughts. She was taken to Helen DeVos\nin Grand Rapids. She had been in the care of Ingham County CMH and on 8/5/2021\nthey deemed she no longer met criteria for Psychiatric hospitalization. The hospital\nhad deemed that she was going to be discharged that day. Maple lodge refused to\nhave her back into their program and would not pick her up. This left Youth A with no\nplacement. This occurred after a lot of discussion that they were contracted to\nprovide care and would need to pick her up and for her to remain in their placement\nuntil either another placement could be located or the date of the 30-day notice\nexpired.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Complainant A by phone on 8/6/21. She reported not being the\ndirect person involved but the individual who called the complaint in. She also\nreported being the supervisor of the caseworker monitoring the case. She provided\nthe name and phone number of the Program Manager who has direct knowledge of\nthe complaint.\nI interviewed the DCWL Area Manager by phone on 8/6/21. She reported\nspeaking with the facility yesterday and being told that the facility was informed both\nhospital staff and CMH involved did not recommend Youth A return to the facility\nbecause it would be unsafe for her. She also reported that this is the rational that the\nfacility used as to why they did not feel it was appropriate the youth return to the\nfacility.\nI interviewed Therapist 1 at the facility on 8/9/21. She reported being aware of the\ncomplaint and being Youth A’s primary therapist at the facility. She also reported\nviewing the hospital documentation and identifying that hospital staff and CMH staff\nindicated a return to Maple Lodge would not be a safe place for Youth A. She\nreported receiving “mixed messages” about the placement change of Youth A and\nbeing told by a hospital Social Worker that a return to Maple Lodge would be unsafe.\nShe also reported setting up a meeting on Friday (day after the request for\ndischarge) to discuss with DHHS the best option for placement for Youth A. She\nreported that DHHS removed Youth A from the hospital the day before the meeting\nwithout notifying the facility. She reported informing the hospital that they would\nneed to contact the facility prior to Youth A being discharged but was never\ninformed.\nI interviewed Complainant B by phone on 8/9/21. She reported being informed by\nthe hospital that Youth A was to be discharged on 8/5/21 (Thursday) and the facility\nwas refusing to accept Youth A back into placement. She also reported a belief that\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "the facility was refusing to accept Youth A back into placement because of it would\nnot be safe for her return. She reported never hearing that it was against medical\nadvice for Youth A to return but it is possible “they thought they couldn’t because of\nmedical advice”. She reported having an “understanding” after talking with the Social\nWorker from the hospital, staff from the CMH and the facility on Thursday that Youth\nA could return to the facility until another placement could be located. She reported\nthe facility requested a meeting on Friday, but Youth A had to be discharged from\nthe hospital on Thursday. She also reported a belief that she was placed in a\nhorrible position because the facility was refusing to accept Youth A back until after\na meeting and not having the meeting scheduled prior to the required discharge\ntime. She reported this caused DHHS to find placement for Youth A on Thursday, so\nthere was no need for a meeting with the facility.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 by phone on 8/10/21. She reported being the\nProgram Manager at the facility and was aware of the complaint. She reported\nhaving a meeting scheduled on Friday to discuss the options for Youth A because\nshe believed Youth A was still threatening to kill herself if she was returned to the\nfacility. She reported the purpose of the meeting was to make the placement in a\n“planful way”. She also reported a meeting was held on Thursday to discuss the\nsituation but no one from the facility was invited. She ended the interview by\nreporting again that they were trying to make a healthy decision for Youth A and\nwould be willing to have Youth A return after a meeting.\nI interviewed Social Worker A by phone on 8/11/21. She reported “at no point did\nwe state that Youth A could not go to the facility at time of discharge”. She also\nreported an “after hours staff may have used the term against medical advice” but\nthat it was never used by the staff monitoring the case. She reported a belief that the\nfacility “believed Youth A would be a liability”. She stated, “the facility may not be the\nbest place suited for Youth A, but it was the only place that had placement for her at\nthe time”. She ended when she reported Youth A was cleared medically and\npsychological for discharge from the hospital.\nI interviewed CMH Supervisor A by phone on 8/11/21. She reported being told\nthat the facility was refusing to readmit Youth A after Youth A was not approved for\nPsychiatric Hospitalization. She also reported understanding that “after hours worker\nand emergency room personnel stated there was some indication that a return to the\nfacility would be against medical advice”. She reported speaking to Social Worker A\non Thursday and being told that a return to the facility was not against medical\nadvice.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed email exchanges between DHHS and the facility regarding this incident.\nTwo DHHS emails to the facility were reviewed dated August 5, 2021, at 2:14 PM\nand August 5, 2021, at 3:58 PM. These emails stated that after consultation with the\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "Business Service Center Director, Maple Lodge remains the placement for Youth A\nand offered to approve 1:1 staffing. The caseworker followed up with the hospital\nsocial worker and Ingham County CMH staff where they clarified they are not stating\nYouth A cannot return to Maple Lodge although acknowledged that on call staff may\nhave mentioned that Maple Lodge was not an appropriate placement.\nThe facility responded to the DHHS emails on August 5, 2021, at 4:26PM which\nstated, “Youth A cannot come back to Maple tonight, it is not safe, and we do not\nhave adequate staffing to accommodate her, especially with a 1:1. We need to have\na meeting with everyone to discuss the plan before we will consider bringing her\nback to Maple. We are planning to hold this meeting tomorrow at 10:30am. I will\nsend a team’s invite out shortly. We do not plan to pick Youth A up tonight”.\nI reviewed the 30-day removal letter dated July 14, 2021. This letter outlines the issues\nthat Youth A was presenting to the facility and the challenges that caused the need for a\nchange in placement. Document outlines in the letter includes twenty-one restraints and\nfourteen hospitalizations all for “suicidal” or unsafe behaviors. There is also\ndocumentation of the increased efforts to provide appropriate care which included\n“increased checks, various incentive plans and rewards for safe behavior”. Increased\ntherapy sessions began in May 2021 and efforts were made to avoid restraints. Overall,\nthey reported Youth A’s behaviors of self-harming, AWOLing and property destruction\nhave significantly increased to the point that they are struggling to provide safe and\nappropriate care for Youth A. Part of the letter includes a statement from the Social\nWorker at the hospital and states, “in this writers opinion, might be more appropriately\nplaced in a locked residential facility so that her access to the community could be more\nstrictly regulated”.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nRFCAN contract Unplanned discharge of a youth\n2.10 3) page 31\nb. The Contractor must continue services to the child for up\nto 30 calendar days following written request to the primary\nfoster care caseworker and RPU to discharge the child from\nplacement. A youth must not be moved to another program\nor facility without going through the RPU placement\nprocess.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "ANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews and written\ndocumentation do support the allegations of the facility not\nfollowing through with their contract requirement to keep Youth\nA in care until further placement was found. There was no\nevidence found to support that a return to the facility was\nagainst medical advice and the facility still had eight days left\nuntil the 30-day notice was up. Although, there is evidence to\nsupport that this placement was not appropriate for the issues\nYouth A was presenting, the facility was still under obligation to\ncontinue placement at the time Youth A was discharged from\nthe hospital on August 5, 2021.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that no\nchange be made to the license of this child caring institution\n8/13/2021\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 17, 2021______________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740"
