    "ALLEGATION:\nAgency staff members conducted inappropriate behaviors and verbal interactions\nwith relative placement. There are concerns that the agency has withheld\ndocuments from MCI, has mishandled relative visits, and is not addressing the\nadoption process in an ethical, policy driven manner.\nINVESTIGATION:\nChild C was placed with Relative D on August 21, 2020. Case responsibility was\ntransferred to Antrim/Charlevoix/Emmet County DHHS on August 27, 20020 and\nthen to Child and Family Services of Northwestern Michigan October 20, 2020.Child\nA had been placed with Relative A and Relative B from March 2, 2020 to August 21,\n2020. Child and Family Services of Northwestern Michigan was given the adoption\nresponsibility on October 20, 2020, according to MiSACWIS (Michigan Statewide\nAutomated Child Welfare Information System).\nRelative A states in a letter dated April 26, 2021, “It may be helpful to know that\n(Child C) lived with us for a long time, but currently lives with his other grandparents\nafter we indicated a few months ago that we were unable to apply for adoption for\nspecific and legitimate reasons. After those reasons dissipated, we applied to adopt\nhim. In the interim, his other grandparents applied as well.”\nRelative A was married and divorced from Relative D and they had a now deceased\ndaughter who was the mother of Child C.\nI reviewed the MiSACWIS case record of Child C, and it was documented that on\nMarch 19, 2020, Relative A and Relative B told Child C’s DHHS Worker that they\ncould not provide permanency for Child C. In a documented conversation on April\n20, 2020, Relative A wanted DHHS to say that it was DHHS idea to move Child C to\nRelative D and Relative A wanted Relative D not to tell Child C that he wanted Child\nC moved.\nIn a telephone joint interview with Supervisor 4, Supervisor 5 and Adoption Worker 2\nthey said they were never rude or unprofessional to Relative A. They said at one\npoint during a ZOOM visit between Relative A, Relative B and Child C, Relative A\nheld up a sign that said, “they won’t let us visit” and Adoption Worker 2 politely told\nRelative A that the ZOOM visit was going to end.\nThe agency wrote a “Adoptive Family Assessment Addendum” dated March 15,\n2021 of Relative A and Relative B which they said the following:\nDuring adoption interviews Relative A has focused on disparaging the (Relative\nD and Relative E), particularly (Relative D). This seems to be in an attempt to\npersuade our agency that the (Relative D and Relative E) are not a",
    "good placement for (Child C) rather than just focusing on his needs and how they\ncan continue to maintain and strengthen their relationship with them. (Child C) is\nalready in a home with a family member, his needs are being met, he is thriving\nthere and is bonded with his caregivers. Therefore, there is no reason or\njustification to move him and disrupt him or his life at this time. Given how well\n(Child C) is currently doing coupled with the concerns indicated above, Child and\nFamily Services of Northwestern Michigan are recommending the (Relative D\nand Relative E) as (Child C’s) adoptive parents. Should the (Relative D and\nRelative E) home not be an adoptive option, (Relative A and Relative B) are\nrecommended as a second option.\nRelative A outline allegations against the agency in two letters as follows:\n In a telephone conversation Adoption Worker 2 told they that they “needed\nto do some soul searching”\n The agency would not allow them to ask any questions\n The agency refused to respond to text messages\n The hung up during a phone conversation\n They were admonished for missing a ZOOM meeting which was which was\ndelayed due to a connection problem\n Documents were withheld from the Michigan Children Institute\n Child C was told that they did not want to spend time with him\n That Relative D was addicted to prescription drugs\nI interviewed Adoption Worker 2 by telephone on September 30, 2021. Adoption\nWorker 2 was asked about telling Relative A and Relative B to do “some soul\nsearching”. She said it was in the content of Relative A and Relative B not wanting to\nadopt Child C and then changing their minds and wanting to be a competing party in\nChild C’s adoption process. I asked about not allowing Relative A and Relative to\nask questions. Adoption Worker 2 said that she had called and met with them, and\nthey were always allowed to ask questions. I asked about her not responding to text\nmessages, she said Relative A and Relative B told her that their preferred method of\ncommunication was to use text messaging. Adoption Worker 2 said that she always\nresponded to Relative A and Relative B’s text messages except for one that was\n“snarky”.\nWhen asked if she had ever hung up on Relative A and Relative B, Adoption Worker\n2 said that she had never hung up on Relative A and Relative B. She said that\nduring a ZOOM visit with Child C, Relative A had displayed handwritten notes to\nChild C that were not appropriate and she told Relative A that the ZOOM visit would\nbe over. I asked about the allegation that a ZOOM visit was canceled due to\nconnection problems and Relative A and Relative B were admonished for not\nshowing up for the meeting. Adoption Worker 2 said that never happened.",
    "There was an allegation that the agency withheld documents from the Michigan\nChildren Institute, Adoption Worker 2 said that she never withheld documents and\nshe needed more information on what the allegation was about.\nThe allegation that Child C was told that Relative A and Relative B did not want to\nspend time with him was discussed, and Adoption Worker 2 said that this never\nhappened.\nFinally, there was an allegation that Relative D was addicted to prescription drugs.\nAdoption Worker 2 said they took this allegation seriously and drug tested Relative\nD.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications.\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: Based on the interviews and documents assessed in this special\ninvestigation, it cannot be established that Child and Family\nServices of Northwestern Michigan violated the above rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that there be no change to the licensing status of this private,\nchild placing agency as a result of this special investigation.\nSeptember 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nDon Collier Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager"
