TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not offered technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nAnalyst Report 4/18/18\nThe DCWL analyst between the dates of 4/6/18 and 4/17/18 visited three licensed\nand three unlicensed homes. The analyst conducted interviews with four licensed and\nfour unlicensed providers and four foster children. One child too young to be\ninterviewed was observed. The analyst reported the following findings to be followed\nup by this consultant. The follow up process included interviewing assigned case\nmanager and their supervisor as well as a review of the case files. The findings were\nalso shared with the administration.\n4",
    "“One relative was not aware of the ineligible grant that they may be eligible for.”\nArenac County routinely reviews available resources with unlicensed providers at\nthe time of placement. The assigned case manager will follow up and discuss\navailable resources with providers. Evidence of these conversations can be\nfound in the social work contacts.\n“One birth parent reported an incident in which the assigned case manager\ndiscussed case information in front of a child.”\nThis consultant was advised by the supervisor that the assigned case manager\nwould discuss required drug screens privately with the mother following parent\nchild visitations in the office. The case manager reported that the children were\nwell aware of the mother drug use and often would bring it up during parent child\nvisitations.\nRenewal Inspection 6/20/17\nThe agency was found in compliance with applicable licensing statutes and rules. A\ncorrective action plan was not required.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract and policy. It is\nrecommended that the facility continue on a regular license.\n7/9/18\n_______________________________________\nJames B.
