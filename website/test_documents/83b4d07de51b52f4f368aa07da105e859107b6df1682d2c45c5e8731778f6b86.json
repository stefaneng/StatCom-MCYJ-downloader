    "ALLEGATION:\nAgency has repeatedly refused to use licensed relatives for placement and has\nplaced youth in multiple other placements. Agency has not notified parents or\nlawyers regarding removals and replacements of youth. Agency has also not\ncomplied with offering required parenting time. Agency has also not held required\nmeetings regarding removal of youth even though there is ample time to do so.\nINVESTIGATION:\nChild A was placed into foster care by the Otsego/Crawford/Oscoda DHHS on\nAugust 30, 2018 into an unrelated foster home. Relative B and Relative C got\nlicensed for foster care by Otsego/Crawford/Oscoda DHHS on May 25, 2017 to care\nfor Child A. Otsego/Crawford/Oscoda DHHS placed Child A with Relative B and\nRelative C for one year, from March 15, 2017 to March 15, 2018. Child A was\nreturned to his mother on March 15, 2018.\nOn August 30, 2018, Child A came back into care and was placed into unrelated\nfoster care with Foster Parent 8. On July 10, 2019, Child A was placed into unrelated\nfoster care with Foster Parent 9. On January 03, 2020, Child A was placed into\nunrelated foster care with Foster Parent 10. On May 12, 2020, Child A was placed\ninto unrelated foster care with Foster Parent 11. On February 16, 2021, Child A was\nplaced into unrelated foster care with Foster Parent 12.\nRelative B and Relative C remained licensed for relative only foster care.\nOtsego/Crawford/Oscoda DHHS recommended Relative B and Relative C for two\nchildren, male or female, ages 4-12 with any ethnicity. The next foster home study of\nRelative A and Relative B recommended one male child, age 2-4, and relative only.\nWhen Child A was replaced into an unrelated foster home on January 03, 2020 the\nagency wrote on the change of placement documentation, “(Child A) was not placed\nwith relatives due to the need for a court hearing to discuss relative placement.”\nWhen Child A was again replaced into unrelated foster homes on May 12, 2020 and\nFebruary 16, 2021, the agency wrote on the change of placement documentation,\n“No appropriate relatives were identified for placements.”\nDuring these five unrelated foster home placements, the agency had a willing\nlicensed relative wanting placement that they, the agency, had licensed for relative\ncare.\nAn unannounced visit was made to the Crawford County DHHS office on April 28,\n2021. Case records were reviewed and DHHS Foster Care Worker 1, DHHS Foster\nCare Worker 2, Licensing Worker 6, and Supervisor 3 were interviewed.",
    "DHHS Foster Care Worker 1 said that Child A was placed with a non-related foster\nfamily because Relative B and Relative C sided with the father of Child A and the\nfather was physically abusive to the mother of Child A. DHHS Foster Care Worker 1\nsaid that when Child A was placed with Relative B and Relative C they let Child A\ntalk with his father in contradiction of court orders. DHHS Foster Care Worker 1\nadditionally said that Relative B and Relative C violated confidentiality by forwarding\na text message regarding another one of the agency’s foster children to another of\nthe agency’s foster parent. DHHS Foster Child Worker 1 said that the mother of\nChild A had a drug overdose and Relative A and Relative B did not report this\nincident to DHHS.\nRelative B was interviewed by telephone on May 22, 2021. He said that they got\nlicensed for foster care to care for their nephew. Relative B said that Child A was\nplaced with them from March 15, 2017 to March 15, 2018. Child A was then returned\nto his mother’s care. Relative B said they were not contacted when Child A came\nback into care on August 30, 2018. Relative B said that the one year placement of\nChild A went very smooth. Relative B said there was a special evaluation done by\nthe agency November of 2018 after Child A was placed in a non-related foster\nhome.\nThe special evaluation found rule violation of Foster Home Rule 9505 Confidentiality\n(1) Information obtained, and records maintained is kept confidential\nIt is concluded that (Relative B) and (Relative C) did breach confidentiality.\n(Relative C) admitted she shared a text message between herself and another\nfoster parent with (Parent D). The text message included the names of other\nfoster children. (Relative B) and (Relative C) had the phone numbers of other\nworkers along with the foster care/licensing supervisor. None of these workers\nreceived a call from (Relative B) or (Relative C) voicing their concerns over the\nplacement of (Child A). When this was discussed with (Relative B) and (Relative\nC) during the home visit for the annual inspection of their foster home license,\n(Relative C) stated she didn't see what she did wrong but would accept the\nconsequence of having to complete a corrective action plan. (Relative B)\nreported he saw how this could be a breach of confidentiality. It is hoped by\ncompleting the requirement of attending a second orientation to the foster home\nlicensing rules for the CAP, (Relative C) will better understand the significance of\na foster parent maintaining confidentially and what is entailed to maintain that\nconfidentiality.\nRelative B said they wrote a corrective action plan. Relative B said they were never\ninvited to any Family Team Meetings and were never contacted when Child A was\nmoved on July 10, 2019 or January 03, 2020 or February 16, 2021.",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(3) The agency shall document all of the following in the\nchild's record before a change of placement occurs:\n(c) If the child is not reunited with siblings or placed with\na relative, then the reason why those placements are not\npossible.\nANALYSIS: There was no documentation in the case file to justify not\nplacing Child A with Relatives B and C. They were licensed and\nhad provided care for Child A for a year previously.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nRelative B was interviewed by telephone on May 22, 2021. He said the agency had\nnot been in contact with them “for a year”. Relative B said he was never invited to a\nFamily Team Meeting. Relative B said the court terminated parental rights on Child\nA’s parents on May 5, 2021. Relative B said he hired an attorney to ask the court for\nplacement and the motion to place Child A with Relative B and Relative C had been\nadjourned and they were waiting on the Judge’s ruling.\nMiSACWIS documentation was reviewed and Relative B was not invited to any\nFTMs.\nWhen interviewed on April 28, 2021 DHHS Foster Care Worker 1 said that Relative\nB sided with his brother and she had found the perfect placement for Child A with his\nday care provider and she licensed the home and planned to have them adopt Child\nA.",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nPOLICY FOM FAMILY TEAM MEETING\n722-06B, Page 1\nThe Family Team Meeting (FTM) is an essential component\nof MiTEAM, Michigan’s Child Welfare Practice Model. FTMs\nserve as the primary forum for safety planning,\ncollaborative service planning, service identification, and\nassessing progress. The FTM represents a child-centered,\nfamily-driven, strength-based, team-guided approach,\ndesigned to engage families in developing plans for the\nsafety, permanency, and well-being of their children and\nfamily.\nFTMs should include child welfare staff, parents,\ncaretakers, foster parents, children, youth, and may also\ninclude extended family, friends, neighbors, community-\nbased service providers, community representatives, tribal\nrepresentatives, for Indian children, or other professionals\ninvolved with the family.\nDuring the FTM, participants work together to create a plan\nfor safety, placement, and permanency tailored to the\nindividual needs of each child. This process provides a\nforum to share ideas and opinions and stresses the\nimportance of the family’s perspective and involvement. In\naddition, this process encourages full participation of all\nparticipants, honest communication, and promotes dignity\nand respect.\nANALYSIS: The agency failed to follow the above policy by not inviting the\nrelatives to FTMs when the Youth reentered care. This would\nhave allowed for input of the relatives in case planning,\nvisitation, etc.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt recommended there been no change in the licensing status of this public, child\nplacing agency upon the receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan.\nAugust 12, 2021\n________________________________________\nDon Collier Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 16, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager"
