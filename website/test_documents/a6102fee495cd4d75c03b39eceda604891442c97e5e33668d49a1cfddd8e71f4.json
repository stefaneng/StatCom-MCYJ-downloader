As a result, Youth B went to Youth A’s bedroom to get\nthe vape. Youth A opened his bedroom door for Youth B and\nrequested Youth B to perform oral sex on him when entered the\nbedroom.

Complainant reported Youth B said on\n7/3/24, Staff 1 opened the bathroom door for him in the bedroom\nhallway, but instead of going fully into the bathroom, Youth B went\ninto Youth A’s room as soon as Staff 1 was out of sight.

However, when Youth B entered\nYouth A’s room, Youth A told Youth B he didn’t have a vape, and\ninstructed Youth B to perform oral sex. Youth B told Complainant\nhe didn’t want to, but he was afraid Youth A would hurt him, so he\ndid it. Youth B told Complainant Youth A didn’t make any direct\nthreats against him, but he was scared and felt he had to comply.\nYouth B told Complainant after it happened, he asked staff to let\nhim in his own room, which they did. Complainant reported Youth\nB was very open and was crying when he told her what happened.\nComplainant reported Youth B never mentioned Youth A\npenetrated him during the encounter and he never mentioned how\nlong he was in the room.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/30/24\nin coordination with LE. Youth A reported Youth B has never\nbeen in Youth A’s bedroom or been invited to his bedroom. Youth\nA reported before these allegations occurred, Youth A got along\n2",
    "well with Youth B and was even trying to mentor Youth B because\nYouth B was newer to the unit. Youth A reported Youth B has\nasked Youth A for a vape because he’s had some on the unit in\nthe past, but Youth A told Youth B he didn’t have one.

Youth B\nreported Youth A told him he had a vape in his room. Youth B\nwanted to use the vape, so he snuck in Youth A’s room. Youth A\nthen told Youth B he didn’t have a vape. Youth A pulled down his\npants and told Youth B to get on his knees and “give him head”.\nYouth B reported his adrenaline and anxiety was “rushing” so he\nlistened to Youth A.

Staff 1 reported she\nstarted to open Youth B’s bedroom door for him, and he said, “but\nI was bored”.

    "1 reported she walked back down the hall and into the milieu. Staff\n1 reported she didn’t remember letting Youth B into the bedroom\nhallway bathroom that night.

Staff 2 reported he completed bedroom\nchecks during the timeframe of Youth B going in and out of his\nroom, and there was no indication that night of anything\nhappening between Youth A and Youth B or Youth B being in\nYouth A’s room.

ES reported around\n7/15/24, Youth B was talking to her, and brought up the incident\nwith Youth A. ES reported Youth B said “[Youth A] punctured me”.\nES reported she asked a few questions to clarify what Youth B\nmeant, and he responded almost like he was trying to figure out\nhow to put the whole story together. Youth B told ES he went into\nYouth A’s room to get a vape, but when he got into Youth A’s\nbedroom, Youth A said he didn’t have a vape and asked for oral\nsex instead.
