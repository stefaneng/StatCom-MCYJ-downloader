This is a\nrepeat issue.\nYouth B had been out of his prescribed medications multiple days prior to 01/06/22.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was originally received, on 12/21/21, as transferred for investigation.\nThe allegations noted the following,\nYouth A (17) resides at Methodist Children's Home Society. Youth A is\nprescribed psychotropic medications. He is diagnosed with Attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD),\nemotional impairment, cognitive impairment, and Reactive Attachment Disorder\n(RAD). Youth A has not been given his 4PM psychotropic medications at\nMethodist Children's Home Society. He has been without this medication for the\nlast week. Methodist Children's Home Society has had issues with staff leaving.\nUpper management at Methodist Children's Home Society was not aware that\nYouth A has been without his medication for the last week. Youth A's\nmedications were never put on the facility log to be refilled. In November 2021,\nthere was a similar incident with Youth A not getting his medications at Methodist\nChildren's Home Society.\nI interviewed the complainant via phone, on 12/21/21, and confirmed the information\nin the allegations.\n3",
    "I interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Worker via phone, on 12/21/21. The Foster\nCare Worker reported having visited with Youth A earlier in the day, on 12/21/21,\nand found that he was not receiving his 4:00pm medication. The Foster Care Worker\nsaid that she had reached out to the Family Transition Coordinator (FTC) and\nDirector 2 with this concern. The Foster Care Worker reported that there is a safety\nplan in place for contacting her and others in the event that Youth A is not given his\nmedication, but this was not done. The Foster Care Worker reported concerns\nrelated to potential behavioral issues when on home passes with his mother, if Youth\nA is not getting his medications as prescribed. The Foster Care Worker said that\nDirector 2 stated she would address the medication issue in November, when Youth\nA did not receive all of his medications another time, but Director 2 has not.\nI met with Director 1 at the facility, on 12/21/21. Director 1 reported that Director 2\nhas been responsible for overseeing the residents’ medications while the facility\nhired a new nurse. Director 1 reported that the new nurse was hired and just started\nyesterday. Director 1 said that she looked at the medications and also found Youth A\nhad missed medication. Director 1 said that a meeting was held yesterday with her,\nthe Nurse, and Director 2 to discuss this. The Nurse is following up with the\npharmacy to rectify the issue.\nI met with the Nurse at the facility, on 12/21/21. The Nurse confirmed that she just\nstarted the day prior but had been told about the medication issue for Youth A. The\nNurse confirmed that the 4:00pm medication was the only one that was out. She\ncalled the pharmacy while I was present and confirmed that the medication was\ngoing to be delivered that day and coordinated with the pharmacy to have the\nmedication delivered earlier than normally scheduled, so that Youth A would have it\nfor his home pass that day.\nI interviewed Director 2 at the facility, on 12/21/21. Director 2 has been overseeing\nmedications/medical for residents while the facility hires a new nurse to replace the\none who resigned. Director 2 reported that she does go through the Medication\nAdministration Records (MARs) but noted the last time she did was on 12/03/21.\nDirector 2 reported that medications were ordered 12/09/21 but Youth A’s 4pm\nmedication was not in there. He had six doses left. Director 2 said that she emailed\nthe pharmacy to advise of the situation. Director 2 said that Youth A’s Foster Care\nWorker then reported Youth A was not getting his medication and when Director 2\nchecked, she found that to be true. Director 2 called the pharmacy and was told they\ndidn’t fill the prescription because they needed a new prescription from the doctor.\nDirector 2 said she then called the doctor and got a new prescription yesterday,\nwhich was to be filled today, 12/21/21. Director 2 said that she did not know why\nthere was a gap in the medications.\nThe MARs were reviewed with Director 2 and the code “physically unable to take”\nwas entered by staff beginning 12/14/21, which would have been the day he ran out\nof medication. This entry continued on the MARs though 12/21/21, with the\n4",
    "exception of 12/17/21. Director 2 said that staff would put this entry because there\nwere none of that medication remaining.\nOn 01/11/22, a second complaint was reported to DCWL related to medication\nadministration and dispensing. This complaint noted the following,\nI was copied on an email on 1/6/22 from Youth B’s mother to facility case\nmanager (FTC) stating that Youth B had been out of his prescribed morning\nmedications for several days. Youth B is prescribed several meds, including\nthose for psychiatric reasons. On 1/7/22, I received an email from the Nurse\nconfirming that Youth B has been out of his medications for several days. Youth\nB is placed by his parents, at Methodist, funded by Medical Subsidy through\nAGAO.\nI interviewed Complainant 2 via phone, on 01/10/22. Complainant 2 reported being\nadvised of this medication issue from a string of emails sent to her. The emails\nincluded Youth A’s mother’s communication with the facility FTC related to\nmedications not being provided to Youth A. Complainant 2 forwarded the emails for\nmy review.\nDocumentation reviewed for the investigation includes the following,\n Medication Administration Records for Youth A for December: Out of one\n4pm medication from 12/14/21-12/21/21. Missing documentation of\ndispensing one or more doses, for Youth A, on four different medications.\nTotal of seven doses of mediations missed in December.\n Medication Administration Records for Youth B for December and January.\nMultiple doses of five different medications had no documentation of being\ndispensed for Youth B in December. “Physically unable to take” and “out of\nmeds” was noted by staff for three medications for Youth B from January 1-\nJanuary 7. On January 14, 2022, none of Youth B’s evening medications\nwere logged as dispensed and no reason provided for missing them.\n Emails provided by Complainant 2.\no 01/06/22 email from Youth B’s mother to the FTC noting Youth B\nreported he wasn’t getting his morning medication for a few days\nbecause they were out, and also an evening medication was out. The\nemail referenced this happened once before.\no 01/07/22 responding email from the FTC noting that medications were\nordered and should be received prior to the home pass for the same\nday.\no 01/07/22 responding email from Youth B’s mother inquiring about\nsome details related to the missing medications.\no 01/07/22 responding email from the FTC noting that the nurse was\nadvised of the medications being out on 01/07/22 but did not know how\nmany days he had been out.\no 01/10/22 responding email from Youth B’s mother noting that she did\nnot have all of his medication for the previous weekend because the\nstaff said they didn’t have any more.\n5",
    " Facility’s medication administration policy\n Youth A’s safety plan, dated 11/08/21. The plan states that Youth A will have\naccess to the phone to inform him Foster Care Worker if he misses\nmedication. Youth A will report concerns to a supervisor or his FTC. The\nFoster Care Worker will follow up on concerns with Methodist staff and\nmanagement.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\n(g) Methods for dispensing medication when the\nresident will be off site.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation as the documentation provided by the\nfacility, for both Youth A and Youth B, showed that not all\nmedications were dispensed as prescribed. It also appears that\nthe facility did not ensure that all medications were provided for\nYouth B for a home pass, based on the emails exchanged\nbetween the mother and the facility. Medication dispensing\nissues have been found repeatedly over the past few months,\nwhile the facility was in transition with nurses, so it is critical that\nthe facility administration ensure oversight to this process to\navoid further violations.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nI advised Director 2 to document her reviews of the MARs for\nfuture CAP compliance verification. Saving all the MARs does\nnot show that she reviewed them or acted when needed.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0207012 - intake 12/08/21; CAP pending approval\n2022C0207007 - intake 11/16/21; CAP pending approval\n2022C0108004 - intake 11/04/21; CAP approved 12/01/21\n2021C0219034 - intake 04/26/21; CAP approved 06/15/21\n2021C0219016 - intake 12/04/20; CAP approved 03/01/21\n2020C0108024 - intake 01/22/20; CAP approved 02/19/20\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation and 2022C0108005, a first provisional\nlicense is recommended, upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan for the\nnoted violations.\nJanuary 26, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 2, 2022\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
