    "discharge documentation language updated to reflect a date and person\nthe discharge information was discussed with and provided to, and a\ncompliance review to occur quarterly for all action steps. The CAP was\nimplemented and successful as neither of these areas were citations\nduring this period under review.\n• Special Investigation 2023C0000460 with CAP approval date of\n8/1/2023 was a result of a violation for Intervention standards and\nprohibitions.

The facility continues to focus on report timeliness and\nenhance staff trainings related to proper intervention techniques.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviews were completed during the inspection. The staff all report feeling\nsupported by administration and enjoying the new programming.
