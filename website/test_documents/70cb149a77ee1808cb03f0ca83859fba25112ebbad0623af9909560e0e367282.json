CA\nreported she did observe sores on the feet of Youth A but stated\nhe has had them for a couple of days and it appears to be from\nhim scratching bites or sores on his feet.

Youth A denied that other youth or staff saw\nStaff 1 twist his arm. He stated it happened while they were in the\nconference room. Youth A was reminded that there were other\nstaff in the conference room and asked if they saw Staff 1 twist his\narm, and Youth A stated they did not see it.\nOn 06/30/2025 a voice message was left for Foster Care Worker\n(FCW) advising of DCWL investigation.

Youth A then ran outside, ran around the campus and was\nbanging on windows. Youth went to Motor City room and pushed\nthe window in and climbed through the window to enter the\nbuilding. Once staff was inside, shoes of Youth A were taken as a\npreventive measure due to going AWOL.\nVideo Footage:\nChrist Child House Video showed Youth A and Staff 1 in the\ncommunity room right off from the conference room. Youth A is\nseen coming into the community room through one door and then\nwalking out another door. Staff 1 is seen walking behind Youth A\nand also exits the community room behind Youth A. There is no\ncamera in the conference room, thus there is no video footage of\nthe alleged incident.\nTour of Agency:\nOn 06/23/2025 a tour of the agency, specifically the area of the\nalleged incident, was reviewed. No areas of concern were noted.\nAnalysis At the conclusion of the investigation, the agency was found to be\nin compliance. Interviews were completed with both staff and\nyouth at the agency and there was no evidence to support non-\ncompliance.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention: (b) Denial of any essential program service as\npunishment.

    "(iv) Shelter, clothing, medical care, or essential personal needs,\nincluding culturally specific items.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Agency staff took shoes of Youth A.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nIn-person interviews were completed with the following at\nChrist Child House on 06/23/2025, unless otherwise noted.\nAn interview was completed with Chief Administrator (CA). CA\nalso confirmed that Youth A did not have regular access to his\nshoes as a AWOL deterrent.\nAn interview was completed with Staff 1. He confirmed that the\nshoes of Youth A were removed as an AWOL deterrent. Once\nback in the agency, Staff 1 reported he removed the shoes of\nYouth A.\nAn interview was completed with Youth A. He confirmed that\nStaff 1 had taken his shoes. When asked why his shoes would be\ntaken, he stated so he would not keep going AWOL.\nIn-person interviews were completed with the following at\nChrist Child House on 07/17/2025, unless otherwise noted.\nAn interview with HR Director, Clinical Director, Staff 2 and\nSupervisor 1 were completed. All staff confirmed that the shoes\nof youth are taken as a deterrent to going AWOL. Each staff\nstated it was a part of the agency policy and had been in place for\nsome time.\nAn interview was completed with Youth B, Youth C and Youth D.\nAll three youth reported that staff will take the shoes of a youth if\nthey keep going AWOL from the facility.\nDocuments Reviewed\nCCH AWOL Policy - Christ Child House considers all incidents of\nmissing residents of high priority requiring immediate attention and\nprompt reporting to the parent/guardian and appropriate\nauthorities; they must be reported as missing immediately when\ntheir whereabouts are unknown.

    "approved placement without legal permission. If a client is AWOL\nfor more than 5 days, he will be discharged from the program.\nThe DHHS worker has discretion to discharge a client\nimmediately, if they so desire. Upon residents return to the\nfacility, the Supervisor/Coordinator on duty will place the resident\non AWOL status which consist of: A. Resident will have his shoes\nplaced in the supervisors’ office B. Resident will be given his\npajamas to be worn in the facility.\nAnalysis At the conclusion of the investigation, the agency was found to be\nin compliance. Interviews were completed with both staff and\nyouth. Review of the AWOL policy documents the removal of\nshoes as a deterrent to AWOL and not a form of discipline.\nTechnical Assistance\nReview and adjustment to the AWOL policy should be made to\nensure there is no violation relative to not allowing youth access to\nclothing items. Interviews with staff and youth as a part of another\nspecial investigation, assessed removal of shoes as punitive. In\naddition, there is no evidence that the removal of shoes and or\nother clothing items has not deterred youth from going AWOL. In\ncases where the removal of shoes does deter a youth from\nrunning away this measure should be added to their treatment\nplan.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\nSection (3) The ratio formula for direct care workers shall correspond with\nDescription the institution’s purpose and the needs of the residents and shall\nassure the continual safety, protection, and direct care and\nsupervision of residents.\nViolation Additional Finding of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Agency failed to provide one-to-one staffing for Youth A as\nrequired\nInvestigation Interviews:\nIn-person interviews were completed with the following at\nChrist Child House on 06/23/2025, unless otherwise noted.\n7",
    "An interview was completed with Staff 1. He reported that Youth\nA can require a one on one, but the agency was short staffed\ntoday, so they were not able to staff Youth A as required.\nAn interview was completed with Youth A. He reported that he is\nnot staffed one to one today. He reported that he sometimes has\na staff with him all the time, but not today.\nDocuments Reviewed\nCCH One to One Staffing Extension Request Letter for Youth A\nDated 6/17/2025. To support his continued placement and meet\nhis complex needs, Christ Child House respectfully requests\ncontinued funding for intermittent 1:1 staffing of up to 18 hours per\nday during waking hours, at a rate of $33.99 per hour. We\nacknowledge the ongoing challenges with staffing availability and\naffirm that 1:1 services will be provided as additional staffing\npermits. Christ Child House will bill the Department of Health and\nHuman Services (DHHS) only for the hours during which 1:1\nstaffing is actually provided.\nAnalysis At the conclusion of the investigation, the agency was found to be\nin compliance. Interviews were completed with both staff and\nyouth. The agency has been approved for one-to-one staffing for\nYouth A as additional staffing permits. Although the youth is\neligible for one to one staffing, on this date his behaviors and\nneeds were not escalated to require monitoring at the one to one\nlevel and his supervision needs were being appropriately met.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n08/25/2025\n______________________________________________________________________\nCassandra Thomas Date\nLicensing Consultant\n8",
