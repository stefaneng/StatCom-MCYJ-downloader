At around 5:46pm, Staff 1\nand Staff 2 realized Youth A was not with the group and called\nback to the unit supervisor to see if Youth A was left there.\nSupervisor 1 checked the camera and saw Youth A was there and\nmade it to the unit at 6:14pm so he was no longer unsupervised.\nYouth A was not harmed and reported he was sleep and did not\nrealize that they had left until he woke up.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via phone on 7/1/2024 and\nagain face to face at the facility on 7/2/2024. He reported\nreceiving a phone call from Staff 1 on Saturday 6/29/24 at\napproximately 5:46PM who informed Complainant that the unit\nwent on an outing and mistakenly left Youth A at the unit.\nComplainant checked the live video feed and observed Youth A\nsitting on the couch watching television on the unit. Complainant\nwent to the unit, arriving at approximately 6:14PM and spoke with\nYouth A. Youth A informed Complainant that Youth A was “fine”\nand needed nothing. Complainant reported Staff 1 informed him\nthat the group left the unit at approximately 3:38PM and it was a\n“little over two hours” when noticing Youth A was not present. He\nreported the process staff are to follow for an outing includes staff\ncommunicating about who they are taking on the outing, and what\nsupervision is provided for youth staying behind. He believed staff\ndid not communicate with each other to ensure all youth were\npresent.\nAdministrator was interviewed via phone on 7/1/2024, face to\nface at the facility on 7/2/2024 and again via video conference\non 7/5/2024. She reported the staff did not follow the supervision\npolicy and she will provide this policy plus all other information\nrequested. Staff 1 and Staff 2 used two vans to transport the youth\non the outing and it appears that they had communication issues.\n2",
    "The plan for staff at this time is that they will not engage in outings\nand will not work on the unit alone until this investigation is\ncompleted. She reported Supervisor 2 who was on campus was\nnotified and sent to the unit prior to Complaiant’s visit to the unit to\ncheck on Youth A. She reported staff are to do “head checks” as\noutlined in the policy even when on outings.\nYouth A was interviewed at the facility face to face on\n7/2/2024. An interpreter was used due to Youth A having very\nlimited English skills. Youth A reported being in the program for\nthe past 3 to 4 months and feeling safe but unsafe when alone.\nYouth A reported not being sure what occurred that he was left\nalone. He recalled being informed by staff (believes both Staff 1\nand Staff 2) that the unit was going on an outing, but Youth A\ninformed Staff 2 that he wanted to stay behind. Youth A reported\nStaff 2 came to him about 3:30PM and asked again about going\nand Youth A told her he was not interested in going on the outing.\nYouth A went to his bedroom and when awaking he found\neveryone else gone. Youth A reported not wanting to go on the\nouting because he believed the group was going to be playing in\nthe water and Youth A didn’t want to engage in this activity. Youth\nA reported it has always been an option to not engage in outing\nbut there has always been staff that stay behind to supervise.\nYouth A reported a supervisor (unable to identify) came to the unit\naround 5:00PM and spoke with Youth A.\nStaff 1 was interviewed at the facility face to face on 7/2/2024.\nHe reported getting to the beach and realizing Youth A was\nmissing from the group. At that time, Staff 1 called Complainant.\nHe reported leaving with the group from the facility at\napproximately 3:50PM. Staff 2 was checking on all of the youth\nwhile Staff 1 got items ready for the outing. They arrived at the\nbeach at approximately 5:00PM and after another youth\n(unidentified) asked where Youth A was, staff realized that Youth\nA was missing. Staff 1 reported not completing a “head count”\nprior to leaving and having one youth change vans just prior to\nleaving the facility. He reported there was a lack of communication\nbetween himself and Staff 2 as to each number of youths in the\ntwo vans. Staff 1 reported being told by Staff 2 Youth A informed\nher that he was not interested in going on the outing when Staff 1\nrealized Youth A was missing on the beach. Staff 1 reported\nspeaking with Staff 2 about the situation and both realizing they\nmade a mistake.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via phone on 7/2/2024. He\nreported receiving a phone call from Complainant about a youth\n3",
    "being left at the facility by staff when the unit went on an outing.\nComplainant asked Supervisor 2 to go to the unit to ensure the\nsafety of Youth A because Complainant was 10-minutes away.\nSupervisor 2 went to the unit but because he had yet to be cleared\nby ORR to enter the unit (has only had current position for 5\nmonths and needs clearance from ORR to enter the program), he\nstood in the hallway and waited for Complainant to arrive.\nSupervisor 2 could hear music from the unit but never visibly\nobserved Youth A.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 7/5/2024. She reported\nfocusing on prepping for the activity and making sure there was\nenough snacks and water for the youth. She reported going into\nYouth A’s room at approximately 3:15PM and Youth A told her\nYouth A didn’t want to go. Youth A then told Staff 2 Youth A was\nopen to going and Staff 2 informed Youth A to be in the milieu\narea at 3:30PM. Staff 2 reported a belief that Youth A was going\nto go at that time. Once at the park around 5:45PM, another youth\n(unidentified) asked about Youth A and Staff 1 and Staff 2 realized\nYouth A was missing. Staff 2 reported missing the head count of\nyouth and was unable to explain what had occurred to leaving\nYouth A behind. She reported both she and Staff 1 made mistakes\nin their supervision of the youth in their care. Staff 2 assumed\nStaff 1 had the other youth in his van because she had three\nyouth in her van during the trip to the park.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nWedgwood Christian Services Client Safety Policy 05-09\ndated 4/18/2018. This document outlines staff’s responsibilities to\nkeep youth safe and secure while in care. It is documented that\nthis includes the responsibility of specific supervision practices\nnecessary to ensure safety. It is also documented that staff are to\nconduct “head counts” of youth no less often than every fifteen\nminutes.\nWedgwood Christian Services Activity Treatment –\nResidential Staff Expectations dated 8/31/2018. This document\noutlines staff’s expectation during activities. It is documented that\nstaff are to make certain that there is no unsupervised interaction\namong youth during the activity.\nStaff 1’s personnel file: Documentation indicates Staff 1 was\nhired on 2/17/2023 and there is no disciplinary action documents\nin the file. Staff 1 is current on his training.\n4",
    "Staff 2’s personnel file: Documentation indicates Staff 2 was\nhired on 11/20/2023 and there is no disciplinary action documents\nin the file. Staff 2 is current on her training.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as evidence by Staff 1,\nand Staff 2’s admitting to not following policy and providing\nappropriate supervision to Youth A during an outing in which\nYouth A was left by himself at the facility. There is also no\nevidence that Staff 1 and Staff 2 completed the required “head\ncounts” every 15-minutes.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered to the facility in the aspect of\ndeveloping a check list to be taken during an outing to ensure the\n15-minute “head counts” are completed and to ensure all youth\nare present. Head Checks should be documented so this action\ncan be proven to have taken place.\nAdditionally, when the agency determines a youth is left\nunsupervised, it is imperative that youth safety be the priority and\nverification of safety be completed regardless of outside\nexpectations.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000002 Dated 10/31/22, CAP approved 12/22/22.\n2023C0000274 Dated 7/27/23, CAP approved 5/26/23.\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n8/6/2024\n______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 7, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
