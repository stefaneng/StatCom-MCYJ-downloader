    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff qualifications\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nDescription following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 walked into Youth A's bedroom and grabbed Youth A's\nbreast area with both hands.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant 1:\nComplainant 1 was contacted via telephone on 12/13/24. No new\ninformation was shared.\nAdministrator 1:\nAdministrator 1 reported Youth A has made allegation in the past\nto be removed from programs. Administrator 1 reported Staff 1\ndoes not have disciplinary action in her file that relates to these\nallegations. Administrator 1 reported Youth A has filed three\nwritten grievances, which were all unfounded. Administrator 1\nreported these past grievances appear to be an attempt on the\npart of Youth A to leave the program. Concerning the specific\nallegations, Administrator 1 reported Staff 1 is a good staff and\nthere have not been any issues with Staff 1. Administrator 1\nreported it would not be abnormal for a staff to walk into a youth’s\nbedroom.\n*The following interviews were conducted face to face at the\nfacility on 12/17/24 with DHS Worker and Detective from the\nOakland County Sherrif’s Office.\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 reported Youth A is an anxious and easily agitated youth in\nthe program. Staff 1 reported Youth A has been on suicide watch\ndue to being a danger to self and others. Staff 1 reported Youth A\ndoes not always complete her work in school. Staff 1 reported she\nhas minimal conversation with Youth A due to the allegations she\ncreates about others. Staff 1 reported she works the morning shift,\nso the youth are normally waking up, completing hygiene and then\ngoing to school. Staff 1 reported the teachers are teaching so\nthere is not constant interaction with the youth and staff. Staff 1\ndescribed the morning wake up as opening doors and turning on\n2",
    "lights. Staff 1 reported she has a structured routine in the morning\nso that safety is established. Staff 1 reported staff can enter a\nyouth’s room if necessary. Staff 1 reported she went into Youth\nA’s room once in the morning. Staff 1 reported she remembered\nthis particular date because it was a “snow day.” Youth A had\nasked Staff 1 for assistance in opening her window shades. Staff\n1 reported she went into the room and was unable to open them.\nShe then left the room. Staff 1 reported the shades are inside the\nwindows which is why she couldn’t figure it out. Staff 1 reported\nshe has never touched Youth A on her breast or grabbed her\nbreasts.\nStaff 2:\nStaff 2 reported she has worked with the agency for six months.\nStaff 2 reported she works often with Staff 1. Staff 2 reported she\nloves working with Staff 1 and learns a lot from her. Staff 2\nreported she has never seen Staff 1 unprofessional or\ninappropriate with any of the youth.\nStaff 3:\nStaff 3 reported she works with Staff 1 twice a week for the last six\nmonths. Staff 3 reported she has never witnessed Staff 1 being\nunprofessional or inappropriate with the youth. Staff 3 proceeded\nto state Staff 1 doesn’t let the youth get close to her. Staff 1\ndoesn’t allow hugs, side hugs, or fist bumps. All of the youth are\naware of this. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 has good boundaries with\nthe youth and has witnessed this. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 had\ngood boundaries with Youth A as well and did not notice anything\ndifferent in the way Staff 1 treated any of the youth. Staff 3\nreported Youth A is anxious, quiet, and has made “general”\naccusations to be removed from the placement. Staff 3 reported\nthese accusations are mostly about her health, in an attempt to go\nto the hospital and leave Camp Oakland.\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported Staff 1 asked to come into her room one\nmorning and “groped” her by grabbing her breasts. Youth A\nreported no one else was in the room with them and no one else\nsaw it. Youth A was unable to provide any other details, but stated\nshe did not ask Staff 1 to help her with the blinds in her room.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 is a nice staff and has not had any\nconflicts with her up until this situation.\nYouth B:\nYouth B reported she walked past Youth A’s bedroom the morning\nof the allegations. Youth B reported it was a “snow day.” Youth B\n3",
    "reported she was on her way to the restroom so didn’t see\neverything. Youth B reported she only saw Staff 1 by the window\nand Youth A sitting on her bed, while she walked by. Youth B\nreported she was aware of the allegations that Youth A had made\nagainst Staff 1. Youth B reported at lunch time, a week after the\nincident, Youth A told her Staff 1 came into her room and placed\none hand on Youth A’s chest. Youth B reported Youth A said,\n“Maybe this will get me home sooner.” Youth B reported she has\nnever seen Staff 1 touch any youth. Youth B reported Staff 1 is\nconsidered a “strict” staff.\nDocuments:\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. All clearances and\ntraining are up to date. There is not disciplinary action in\nher file.\n• I reviewed the Weekly Update form for December 5, 2024.\nThis was the “snow day.” The weekly update recorded by\nStaff 1 concerning Youth A was: “Met unit goal. Good,\ntimely AM routine. Completed details. Followed program.\nFollowed staff direction. Respectful…”\n• I reviewed the Oakland County Sherrif Case Report, case\nnumber 240310301. Prosecution is declined; case\ndismissed.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. There is no evidence to\nvalidate Staff 1 touching Youth A. Interviews with Administrator 1,\nStaff 2, Staff 3, and Youth B reveal Staff 1 as a good staff with\ncareful boundaries. Youth A was unable to provide details\nconcerning the event and discussed the incident later with Youth\nB, hoping this would get her home sooner. Youth B confirmed\nseeing Staff 1 near the window blinds when she walked past\nYouth A’s bedroom.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n2/6/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
