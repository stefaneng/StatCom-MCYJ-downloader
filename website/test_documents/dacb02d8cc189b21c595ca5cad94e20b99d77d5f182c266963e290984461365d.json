Youth was supposed to be on 5 minutes checks at this time\nand have the bathroom door cracked open. Staff member in\ncharge did not follow appropriate precautions in place to prevent\nthis incident.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant/Administrator was interviewed face to face at\nthe facility on 4/14/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker.\nComplainant reported there were multiple concerns noted in the\nvideo review she completed of the night of Youth A’s self-harm\nincident on 4/12/23. Complainant noted Youth A’s safety\nprecautions were not followed and staff did not complete interval\nchecks as needed for Youth A, Youth B or Youth C.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the hospital on\n4/14/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A prefers\npronouns They/Them and will be referenced as such throughout\nthe report. Youth A stated they were on 1:1 supervision from\nNovember 2022 until recently. Youth A reported when they are on\n1:1 supervision, there are 15-minute checks. However, when they\nare not on 1:1 supervision, there are 5-minute checks. Youth A\nreported they cannot have the door of their bedroom, or the door\nof the bathroom fully closed. The bathroom door must remain\ncracked, and the bedroom door must remain open. Youth A\nrefused to take their medications for 3 days and, as a result, they\ndid not sleep for 3 days. Youth A reported on 4/12/23, they went to\nHobby Lobby with Staff 3 and bought a craft kit. The craft kit had\npaint by number, color by number and scratch art. Youth A\nreported Staff 3 took the tools utilized for scratch art out of the kit\nso Youth A wouldn’t harm themselves but failed to take the small\npencil sharpener out of the kit. Youth A reported they broke the\nblade out of the pencil sharpener with the intention to use it to self-\nharm. Youth A reported they were in the bathroom taking a bath\nand the door was cracked. Youth A reported Staff 1 was assigned\nto complete checks on them and believes he conducted 5-minute\nchecks as required. Youth A reported the first time Staff 1 checked\n2",
    "on them, he knocked on the door and asked if they were okay, to\nwhich Youth A responded yes. Youth A reported the second time\nStaff 1 checked on them, they did not respond right away so Staff\n1 asked if they were okay again and Youth A responded no. Youth\nA reported Staff 1 requested to come in the bathroom, which\nYouth A agreed to. Youth A reported they used the blade to cut\ntheir arms in the bathroom and Staff 1 retrieved towels to help\nthem clean up. Youth A reported their intention behind getting the\nkit was not to self-harm, but their intention of going into the\nbathroom that night was to self-harm. Youth A reported they did\nnot want to follow the safety precautions the facility clinician\nprovided after the incident, so Youth A went to the hospital for\ntreatment and assessment.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/18/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Chief Administrator sat\nin on the interview as well. Staff 1 reported Youth A was in good\nspirits on 4/12/23, but still refused to take their medications, which\nwas the third day in a row they had refused. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA is on self-harm/suicide precautions which means they require 5-\nminute checks, are not allowed access to objects they could use\nto harm themselves, must have bedroom door open while inside,\nand must have bathroom door cracked while inside. Staff 1\nreported he and Staff 2 were in the home, but then Staff 2 left to\ngo assist with another crisis, so he was the only staff in the home\nat the time Youth A self-harmed. Staff 1 reported he was not\ncomfortable being the only staff in the home, but the youth were\nall in their rooms and things were calm, so he told Staff 2 he was\nfine with it. Staff 1 reported Youth A requested to take a bath, so\nStaff 1 opened the bathroom for them. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nclosed the door to undress, but Staff 1 made sure the door was\ncracked after Youth A was in the bath. Staff 1 reported Youth A\ntook a bath for approximately 30-40 minutes, and he conducted 5-\nminute checks on them during the entirety of the time they were in\nthe bathroom. Staff 1 reported during each check he conducted,\nhe knocked on the door and asked if Youth A was okay. Staff 1\nreported Youth A responded “yes” each time except the last time\nhe checked, which was around 10:20 pm. Staff 1 said when he\nchecked at that time, the door to the bathroom was fully shut and\nlocked, which is not allowed. Staff 1 reported he was unsure when\nYouth A fully shut the door. Staff 1 reported Youth A didn’t\nrespond at first, but then responded they were not okay. He\nreported he asked Youth A if he could enter the bathroom, and\nYouth A said he could. When Staff 1 entered, Youth A was fully\nclothed laying on the floor with cuts up and down both of their\narms. Staff 1 took away the blade Youth A used to cut themselves\n3",
    "and checked to ensure there were no other tools they could use\nfor self-harm. Staff 1 then left the bathroom to go to the\nmedication room to get towels to help Youth A clean up. On the\nway to the medication room, Staff 1 called Staff 2 and requested\nshe come back to the home because he needed assistance. Staff\n1 brought towels back to Youth A and helped them clean their\nwounds, then provided Youth A a blanket so they could sit in the\nmilieu. Staff 2 called Supervisor for assistance while Staff 1 was\nattending to Youth A. Supervisor and on-call clinician came to the\nhome and attempted to allow Youth A to stay in the home with\nadditional safety precautions of taking medications and stripping\ntheir room, but Youth A would not agree to the precautions, so\nthey went to the hospital instead. Staff 1 reported he was\nspecifically assigned to Youth A, so he was responsible for Youth\nA’s 5-minute checks. If another staff were responsible for the 5-\nminute checks, staff would write on the interval check logs a\ndifferent staff took over responsibility.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/18/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Chief Administrator sat\nin on the interview as well. Staff 2 reported Youth A was in a\ngood mood on 4/12/23. Staff 2 reported Staff 3 left the home the\nevening of 4/12/23 to handle a situation with another youth in the\nhome going AWOL. When Staff 3 did not come back to the house\nfor a while, Staff 2 reported she asked Staff 1 if she could leave to\ngo check on Staff 3 and Staff 1 agreed. Staff 2 reported she called\nStaff 3 and Staff 3 stated she was dealing with a crisis with a\nyouth from another house on campus. Staff 2 reported she went to\nCeblek home to see if she could help. Staff 2 reported there was a\nsupervisor at Ceblek home with two youth and she stayed there in\ncase help was needed. Staff 2 reported no one instructed her or\nasked her to help at Ceblek, and she went there by her own\nchoice. Staff 2 reported she came back to Renucci house when\nStaff 1 called her and reported he needed help because Youth A\nself-harmed. Staff 2 reported when she arrived at the home, she\ncalled Supervisor to request assistance while Staff 1 attended to\nYouth A.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/18/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Chief Administrator sat\nin on the interview as well. Staff 3 reported she was the Shift\nTeam Lead during 2nd shift on 4/12/23. Staff 3 reported she took\nYouth A to Hobby Lobby when Youth A did not want to eat dinner.\nStaff 3 reported Youth A bought a craft kit, which included paint by\nnumber, color by number and scratch art. Staff 3 reported she saw\nthe scratch tools in the kit and took those away so Youth A could\n4",
    "not use the tools for self-harm. Staff 3 reported she did not view\nthe contents of the craft kit or check if there was anything else\nYouth A could use to harm themselves with because she\nassumed the scratch tools were the only things in the kit that could\nbe utilized for self-harm. Staff 3 reported the home was within ratio\nthe night of 4/12/23, so she felt comfortable leaving Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 in the home when she had to handle situations with\nanother youth in the home going AWOL as well a crisis with a\nyouth from another home on campus. Staff 3 reported Youth A\nhad a good day which they expressed by being sociable, talkative,\nand laughing a lot. Staff 3 reported Youth A showed no warning\nsigns she was going to self-harm that night.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n4/18/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Chief\nAdministrator sat in on the interview as well. Supervisor\nreported he, Staff 3 and two other staff were handling a situation\nwith a youth in crisis from another home when the crisis with\nYouth A occurred. Supervisor received a call stating Youth A\nharmed themselves, so he went to the home to view their injuries\nand assess next steps. Supervisor reported he was on the phone\nwith the on-call manager and on-call clinician to determine Youth\nA’s safety and next steps. When he arrived at the home, Youth A\nwas laying on the couch quietly. Youth A had a lot of shallow cuts\non their arms but was no longer bleeding. Youth A refused first aid\ntreatment. The on-call clinician was attempting to safety plan with\nYouth A so Youth A could remain on campus. However, Youth A\nrefused to comply with the safety plan, so 911 was contacted and\nan ambulance took Youth A to the hospital for further assessment\nand treatment. Supervisor reported when he was in the home\nearlier in the evening, everything seemed fine. Prior to this\nincident, no one called him that night and requested additional\nhelp, assistance, or support.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from the night of 4/12/23 was reviewed.

    "completed every 15 minutes and staff must visually see the youth.\nStaff 1 reported the checks should be done at staggered times,\nrather than every 15 minutes exactly, so youth do not know staff\nare coming to check on them.

Staff 1 reported he\nalways fills out the check logs at the time of the checks and does\nnot wait to fill them out because he does not want to forget the\ninformation.

If youth are outside of\nstaff’s eyesight, checks must be completed visually on the youth\nwithin the 15-minute timeframes. Staff 2 reported when she left\nthe home, Staff 1 was responsible for checks on all youth. Staff 2\nreported Youth A has 5-minute checks because they are on self-\nharm/suicide precautions. Staff 2 reported she completed all\nchecks as required on 4/12/23.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/18/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Chief Administrator sat\nin on the interview as well. Staff 3 reported staff are to conduct\ninterval checks by visually seeing as well as hearing youth. Staff 3\nreported the checks are to be conducted by staff every 15 minutes\nor less and should not be conducted every 15 minutes exactly\nbecause it is predictable.
