Staff 1 is on Youth A’s right side\nsecuring her right arm and Staff 2 is on Youth A’s left side securing her\nleft arm. Staff 1 placed his left leg over Youth A’s right leg and Staff 2\ndoes the same with her right leg over Youth A’s left leg. Youth A is\nasked Staff 1 and Staff 2 to release her from the restraint. Staff 3\ncomes and placed a pillow behind Youth A’s head per Staff 1’s request.\nStaff 1 is talked to Youth A telling her to calm down. Youth A is not\nresisting the restraint. Youth A continued to be held in the restraint.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• South Bluff Physical Restraint policy states the Primary Restraint\nTechnique (PRT) is the preferred method. Staff stand behind the\nyouth, hook youth’s arms with theirs, staff places open hands\ntogether on the youth’s back. If the youth continues to resist, it\nmay be necessary to perform a takedown to the floor by staff\nstepping back with one leg, dropping their knee to the ground one\nat a time, into a sitting position. A second staff can be used to\nsupport the legs by placing both arms around the legs at the\nknees.\n• Teaching Family Homes of Upper Michigan Youth Incident Report\ndated 12/13/2022: Banging noises were heard inside Youth A’s\nbedroom. Staff 1 entered Youth A’s bedroom and escorted Youth A\nto the hallway. Staff 2 assisted with the escort. De-escalation\ntechniques were used for thirty minutes. Staff escorted Youth A to\nthe main room to accommodate other youth needing to access the\nbathroom. Staff escorted Youth A to the couch and continued de-\nescalation for twenty minutes. The incident report did not address\nhow the youth was held in the restraint.\n• MiSACWIS Incident Report 145950196 and 145950200 both\ndated 12/13/2022 were consistent with the Teaching Family\nHomes of Upper Michigan Youth Incident report dated\n12/13/2022.\n• Handle with Care Manual PRT demonstrates staff standing\nbehind the youth and hooking the youth’s arms with theirs and\nplacing open hands together on the youths back. If the standing\nPRT transitions to a takedown to the floor, staff takes a long step\nback and lowers the center of gravity causing the youth to be off\nbalance. Staff’s palms are against the youth’s back to support\ntheir weight. Staff lowers their knee to the floor, slowly staging\nthe youths into a sitting position. Staff drops their other knee to\nbe in the “settle” position and the youth is in the sitting position.\nA two-person takedown the primary staff takes over to secure\nboth of the youth’s arms in the PRT. The second staff drops\ntheir knees to the floor and is holding the youth legs at the\n4",
    "knees. The staff securing the youth’s knees signals to the staff\nin the PRT to initiate the takedown. The staff in the PRT steps\nback and drops to their first knee and then second knee and\n“settle” with their knees on the ground and their buttock resting\non the heels of their feet. This brings the youth to a sitting\nposition. The staff securing the youth’s knees can continue\nsecuring the legs if the youth is kicking.\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: Staff 1 received Handle with Care\ntraining on 10/17/2022.\n• Staff 2’s personnel file: Staff 2 received Handle with Care\ntraining on 11/22/2022.\n• Staff 3’s personnel file: Staff 3 is not currently trained in Handle\nwith Care.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance as Staff 1 and Staff 2 did not use\na trained Handle with Care technique to restrain Youth A. Staff 1 lifted\nYouth A by her elbows out of her room into the hallway. Staff 1 did not\nhave the proper hold on Youth A’s arms when he was in the seated\none-person restraint with Youth A as his hands were on Youth A’s\nupper arms holding her arms resulting in Youth A being able to pull\naway from Staff 1. Handle with Care model trains a primary restraint\ntechnique by hooking the youth’s arms with theirs, placing open hands\ntogether on the youth’s back.\nStaff 2 goes in to assist Staff 1 at which time Youth A stands up and\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 have Youth A in a standing escort. Staff 1 and Staff\n2 go from the standing escort to a seated position on the floor with\nYouth A. This is not a trained Handle with Care technique. Handle with\nCare model trains for one staff to take over in the primary restraint\ntechnique and the second staff moves to securing the youths legs\nabove the knee and signals to the primary staff to initiate the takedown\nby taking a deep step back and dropping their knee and then dropping\nthe other knee to bring the youth into a sitting position.\nYouth A was escorted by Staff 1 and Staff 2 into the living room and\ntransitioned back into a restraint with Staff 1 on Youth A’s right and\nStaff 2 on Youth A’s left in a seated position on the couch. Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 secured Youth A’s legs by each placing one of their legs over\nhers. This was not a trained Handle with Care technique.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe facility needs to update their staffing pattern to provide guidance,\njob mentoring, and in the moment coaching for staff as they have a lot\nof unexperienced/new staff.\nThe facility viewed the restraint as two separate restraints- one in the\nhallway and a second in the living room. This restraint was one\n4",
    "restraint as the youth was restrained, placed into an escort, and\nrestrained once in the living room. Due to staff never disengaging from\nthe restraint to the escort and back to the restraint, it is one incident.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4160 Emergency Restraints\nSection The use of emergency restraint as a lifesaving response for a youth will\nDescription be limited to:\n(c) The emergency restraint must not last longer than needed to end\nthe threat of serious physical harm.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The restraint lasted longer than needed to end the threat of serious\nphysical harm.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth A was interviewed via telephone on 1/11/2023. Youth A\nreported she did not remember being restrained in December. Youth A\nstated she did not want to talk any further.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on 1/11/2023. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A was not calm while in the restraint in the hallway. Youth A was\nattempting to bite and hit Staff 1. Staff 1 reported the restraint\ncontinued due to Youth A continuing to be escalated and making\nstatements that she wanted to die, she continued yelling and crying.\nYouth A was not following staff directions to calm down and agree to\ntalk to staff. Staff 1 reported Youth A was continuing to be a serious\nthreat of harm as she was not complying with Staff 1’s directions to\ncalm down and agree to talk to staff as she was fighting the restraint.\nStaff 1 reported once on the couch in the living room, Youth A\neventually calmed enough and agreed to talk to staff at which time the\nrestraint was released.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on 12/20/2022 and 1/11/2023.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A began to calm down in the restraint and Staff 2\nfelt that it was time to release Youth A. Staff 2 gave Staff 1 a look to\nindicate it was time to release however Staff 1 stated to Youth A he\nwould not be releasing Youth A until he knew that Youth A was not\ngoing to hurt herself. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was aware of her\nindicating they should release Youth A from the restraint as she would\nlook at him and then Youth A and every time she did, Staff 2 would\nstate to Youth A they were not releasing. Staff 2 reported the restraint\nlasted longer than necessary and she wanted to stop the restraint\nhowever did not want to go against Staff 1 in front of the youth. Staff 2\nreported Youth A was no longer resisting the restraint in the hallway\nand she did not feel Youth A was a risk to herself. Youth A had calmed\ndown as she was no longer screaming, moving around in the restraint\n4",
    "and was sitting quietly with her head down. Staff 2 reported she had\nloosed her arm that was hooked securing Youth A’s arm as she did not\nfeel the restraint needed to continue. Staff 2 loosed her grip in the\nrestraint in the hallway prior to Youth A being escorted to the living\nroom and restrained on the couch. Staff 2 did resecure her grip going\ninto the escort as Youth A began resisting once in the living room. Staff\n2 reported she did not feel the escort or continuation of the restraint in\nthe living room was necessary as Youth A was no longer a high risk.\nResidential Director was interviewed face-to-face via Teams\nmeeting on 1/11/2023. Residential Director reported staff are trained\nto only restrain youth until they are no longer a risk of harm to themself\nor others. Staff are trained to not hold a youth in a restraint until the\nyouth is compliant, meaning the youth may still be yelling however once\nthe immediate threat of serious physical harm is gone, the youth is to\nbe released from the restraint. Residential Director reported the letting\ngo process should have started when Youth A was still in the hallway\nas he did not see a reason in the video where Youth A was combative\nor demonstrated a level of high risk that would allow for the restraint to\ncontinue. Residential Director reported he did not see a need for Youth\nA to be escorted to the living room and placed back into a restraint as it\ncould have ended in the hallway.\nThe complainant is this consultant as during interviews concerns\nregarding the restraint were discussed.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage of 12/13/2022 Youth A restraint was reviewed on\n1/09/2022.

Consultant\ndid not see in the video where Youth A attempted to bite or hit Staff 1.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• South Bluff Physical Restraint policy states restraints must not\nlast longer than the minimal duration of time it takes for a youth to\ncalm down and to restore safety. Physical restraint must last only\nas long as the threat of physical harm is clearly apparent. This\ndoes not include restraining until the youth calms down. The\nyouth may still be out of emotional control and yelling, moving\naround the area, running, but is no longer a clear threat of\nphysical harm to himself or others and, therefore, making\nphysical restraint not necessary.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance as Youth A was restrained longer\nthan needed to end the threat of serious physical harm. Staff 2 reported\nYouth A calmed down while restrained in the hallway as she was not\n4",
    "resisting the restraint and was sitting quietly with her head down. Staff\n2 loosed her grip in the restraint as she did not feel Youth A was a risk\nany longer. Video shows Youth A sitting on the floor, not resisting the\nrestraint, crying while continuing to be restrained.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV.
