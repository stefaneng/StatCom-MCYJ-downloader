INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10177\nSection (1) The facility shall establish and follow written policy and\nDescription procedures specifying the use of resident restraint.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 3/6/23, a youth was put in an improper restraint by a staff\nmember. The youth was grabbed by the neck and punched in the\nface by the staff member.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplaint Source was interviewed via phone on March 9,\n2023. Complaint Source is identified as Youth B’s therapist. She\nreported she did not have any additional information as Youth B\nwould not go into detail of the incident.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n8, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported\non March 6, 2023, around 7:15 pm she was working with her pod\ndoing an awareness group. She reported she asked Staff 1 for a\npen and was told no which made her upset. Youth A reported\nStaff 3 came into the unit and asked if anyone needed to do a\nbehavior chain, meaning they had to do a behavior modification\nmeeting. She reported Staff 1 kept tilting her head toward Youth A\nto Staff 3. This increased Youth A’s agitation and she started to\nswear at the staff. Staff 1 then unlocked the youth’s doors and\nYouth A reported she knew she was going to be sent to her room\nwhich she refused. Supervisor then entered the area and tried to\nde-escalate her which increased Youth A's behavior to have a\nverbal argument with Supervisor. She reported she began to slap\nthe cups on the tables, knock papers off desks, and flip and throw\nchairs. Supervisor caught the chair Youth A threw at him and she\n2",
    "reported he then began to run at her. Youth A reported it was just\nSupervisor with her at this time. She reported Supervisor threw\nher against the wall and she hit her back left shoulder and head\non the wall. Youth A reported things began to get blurry and she\ndid not feel well. She reported Supervisor swung at her with a\nclosed fist and his knuckle hit her lip. Youth A reported she then\nbegan to fight back. She reported she ended up on the ground\nwith her stomach facing the ground. Youth A reported the reason\nshe ended up on the ground was that Supervisor's body slammed\nher to the ground. She stated he laid on her back, and this made\nso her shoulder blade pop. Youth A reported Supervisor flipped\nher to her back by putting her neck in the corner of his arm,\nbetween his elbow and arm. She stated that he was choking her\nat this time. Supervisor then called for support and Staff 3 came in\nto support by grabbing Youth A’s legs. Youth A reported she then\nwas put into her room, and she began to escalate by flooding her\nroom. She reported some male nurse she did not know came in to\nsee her after the incident. Youth A reported she told him she was\nlightheaded, and he did not do anything. She reported she was\nable to see Nurse 2 this morning for the bumps on her head.\nYouth A reported she felt that this restraint was a “dirty restraint”.\nShe reported this was her first restraint at this facility but has been\nrestrained at prior placements, so she is aware of what is\nsupposed to happen.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nMarch 15, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker and\nDetective. Supervisor had his own attorney present during the\ninterview. Supervisor reported on March 6, 2023, he received a\ncall that Youth A had been in an escalated state. Upon arrival at C\nPod, Youth A was upset because she wanted to make a phone\ncall instead of the activity. She had asked Staff 1 to use her\npersonal pen and Staff 1 stated that she could not. Youth A began\nto swear at Staff 1 and she attempted to verbally de-escalate the\nsituation. Due to Youth A’s main target being Staff 1, Supervisor\ntold Staff 1 he would switch out with her. Supervisor reported he\nattempted to verbally de-escalate Youth A and talk her through\ntechniques to calm herself. He reported Youth A began to hit\nherself in the head with her fists as she was screaming about\nbeing frustrated about her placement. Supervisor reported he\nencouraged Youth A to go to her room and she stated “You guys\nwill have to restrain me.” Youth A then got up and began to knock\npapers off the desk and flip and throw chairs. At this time\nSupervisor reported he gave the single to the control room to go\non lockdown for the facility and told Staff 2 to strip Youth A’s room\nfor safety. Staff 3 entered the unit and Youth A continued to pace\n3",
    "around the room. She then threw a chair at Supervisor and Staff 3\nwhich led Supervisor to go in for a restraint due to safety.\nSupervisor reported when he went into the restraint, he attempted\nto go into a CPI one person’s child control hold by grabbing onto\nYouth A’s wrists. Due to Youth A being near the wall, he was not\nable to get that grip and she ended up throwing a punch at\nSupervisor’s shoulder. While Supervisor attempted to get a hold,\nYouth A dropped her weight to the floor, and she went onto her\nstomach. At this point Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 were there to\nhelp with a team control hold. Supervisor yelled out that they\nneeded to get Youth A onto her back, and they did. He reported\nthe team got her on her back by rolling her on her shoulder and\nwhen she rolled over, she did bite him on his hand/ forearm area.\nHe reported he never grabbed her by her neck to roll her and only\nassisted her by guiding her shoulder in the roll with his hand.\nSupervisor and Staff 2 grabbed her arms and Staff 3 and Staff 4\nhad control of her legs. The supervisor reported he gave the\ndirection to get Youth A up off the ground and escort her to her\nroom. He reported this was Staff 3’s first restraint and he ended\nup lifting Youth A's feet off the ground when given the direction to\nescort Youth A. Supervisor reported immediately he redirected\nStaff 3 to put Youth A's feet down so that he had her feet on the\nground. Supervisor reported he knew what Staff 3 was doing was\nnot CPI compliant and he redirected right away. He reported\nYouth A’s feet were off the ground for a couple of seconds.\nSupervisor reported the staff was able to get Youth A into her\nroom and it was mostly stripped at this point. He reported all four\nstaff entered the room to get Youth A safely in her room and then\nexited one by one. Supervisor reported he was the last one in the\nroom while the other staff stood right out the door. To keep Youth\nA from coming out of the room he did have his arm out front to\nkeep space and keep her from coming to the door. Youth A then\nbegan to flood her room and put the papers from the book that\nwas left in her room covering the windows. She flooded her room\nby putting her shirt into the toilet and continued to flush the toilet.\nStaff had to re-enter the room to clean the mess and make sure\nthe room was safe. Youth A did complain of her head hurting and\nSupervisor had nursing come to see her. He reported she denied\nmedical treatment but has continued to have the medical team\ncheck up on her. Supervisor had Staff 1 check Youth A’s head\nand did note there was a bump but believes it is from when she\nwas hitting herself in the head before the restraint. Supervisor\nreported he felt he did everything he could do with the restraint\nappropriately to keep everyone safe. He reported he did have a\nhard time getting into the initial hold as she dropped her weight to\nthe ground and was near the wall when he went into the restraint.\n4",
    "Supervisor reported he never pushed her or had his arm up by\nYouth A’s neck causing her to choke. He reported does not\nbelieve they hit the wall at any point and if they did it, he would\nhave hit the wall himself not Youth A. He reported Youth A never\ncomplained about hitting the wall. Supervisor reported he gets\ninvolved in a lot of escalated situations due to his role of being the\nSupervisor on shift. He reported he floats around to the units when\nassistance is needed. Supervisor reported on Youth A’s unit they\nhave had to be redirected for inappropriate behavior at times. He\nreported he has never made any comments to the youth that they\ncannot write grievances or that he doesn’t care if they write a\ngrievance about him.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n15, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker and Detective.\nYouth B reported she was in her room when Youth A was\nrestrained by Supervisor. She reported Youth A had pulled the\ncovering off her door window so that Youth B could see what was\nhappening while Youth B was in her room. She reported when she\nfirst looked out her window, Youth A was walking around and\nyelling while the staff was telling her to go to her room. Youth B\nreported she then sat down in her room to braid her hair. She then\nheard more yelling, so she looked up and saw Supervisor was\nagainst the wall with Youth A and believes he threw her against\nthe wall but did not see it. Youth B reported she believes\nSupervisor threw Youth A against the wall because she saw\nSupervisor behind Youth A and heard a bang. She reported she\nnever saw Youth A punch the staff or be aggressive in any way\nand believes Supervisor did a \"dirty restraint\". Youth B stated she\ntalked with Youth A who said Supervisor also threw her against\nthe wall. She reported she has complaints about Supervisor\ntalking about other youth's business such as the youth’s court\ndates or how long the youth have been at the facility. Youth B\nreported the youth can always file grievances and the Assistant\nSuperintendent will always come to talk to the youth who wrote it\nto investigate the situation.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n15, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker and Detective.\nStaff 2 reported on March 6, 2023, her role was to be a floater\nstaff amongst all the pods. She reported she heard a lot of yelling\nand screaming from C pod and went in to talk with Staff 1. It was\nfound Youth A was getting into a verbal argument with Staff 1.\nStaff 2 notified Supervisor of the situation and he ended up\nswitching out with Staff 1 since Youth A was targeting her. All the\nother girls on C pod went into their rooms and Staff 2 put up the\n5",
    "orange sheets for the tracking of bedroom checks. She reported\nSupervisor continued to try to verbally de-escalate Youth A and\nStaff 2 continued to do room checks. At that time, a youth also\nasked to speak with Staff 2, and then Youth A began to throw\nchairs. Staff 2 knew she needed to start to strip Youth A’s room\ndue to her unsafe behaviors. Youth A then threw a second chair\nright at Supervisor and he went into a restraint. Staff 2 reported\nthe restraint initially happened close to the wall and did not see\nthem hit the wall. When Supervisor went into the restraint, Staff 2\nsaw Youth A drop her weight to the ground and because of that\nmotion, she saw Supervisor’s hand go toward Youth A’s upper\nchest. She reported she then went into assisting Supervisor with\nthe restraint when Youth A was on the ground. Staff 2 reported\nshe had Youth A’s left shoulder and went into a CPI team control\nhold. Supervisor had the right shoulder and Staff 3 and Staff 4 had\nYouth A’s legs. Supervisor gave the command to get Youth A up\noff the ground and Staff 3 began to lift her legs off the ground.\nSupervisor redirect Staff 3 and they were able to get Youth A in\nthe appropriate team control hold within seconds. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 3 is a newer staff and did not know that it was not a\napproved restraint technique to lift Youth A's legs off the ground.\nThe staff was then able to get Youth A into her room. Staff 2\nreported she did assist with cleaning up Youth A’s room when she\nflooded it. She reported she feels the team followed the protocol of\nrestraint method and Supervisor did the best he could with Youth\nA dropping her weight to the ground. Staff 2 reported she never\nsaw Supervisor punch Youth A or choke her with his arm or hand.\nShe reported she has no concerns with Supervisor’s interactions\nwith the youth or his ability to do his job appropriately.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on March 22, 2023, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported he has only\nbeen working at the facility for a couple of months. He reported\nthis incident was his first restraint. Staff 3 reported he first was\nworking the control center when he saw Supervisor single the\nlockdown. When he arrived at C Pod he saw Youth A yelling and\nthrowing chairs. He reported he saw Youth A throw a chair at\nSupervisor which led to Supervisor rushing up to her to restrain\nher. He reported everything happened so quickly and Supervisor\nwas not giving clear directions on what to do. Staff 3 reported he\nsaw Youth A hit her head on the door during the restraint but was\nnot clear on how that happened. He reported he did see Youth A\ndrop her weight which led Supervisor to the ground with her. Staff\n3 reported during the restraint he believes that Supervisor's hand\ndid go up by Youth A’s chest but was not on her neck and did not\nchoke her. He reported he believed Supervisor lost his balance\n6",
    "and that is why that happened. Staff 3 reported he still was not\nsure what to do so he went to help Staff 2 with clearing out Youth\nA’s room. Supervisor then yelled to get Youth A on her back and\nfor Staff 3 to grab her legs which he did with Staff 4. Staff 3\nreported when Supervisor said to get Youth A up he thought that\nmeant lifting her legs. Supervisor redirected him immediately to\ndrop her legs and as soon as they crossed the threshold of her\nroom he did. Staff 3 reported Youth A’s legs were only up in the\nair for a couple of seconds. He reported once she was in her\nroom, she spit on Supervisor but was able to calm down and he\nhad no concerns about the actions that took place after that. The\nteam then did a debrief and Youth A began to flood her room.\nStaff 3 reported that the situation went better because Supervisor\nwas clear with the direction they were going to take and knew\nwhat his role was. Staff 3 reported he was trained in CPI training\nin January 2023 and feels that the situation did not seem fully\ncompliant with the training. Staff 3 reported he feels the facility\nshould provide extra training in restraints because he did not feel\ncomfortable. Staff 3 noted he had no concerns with Supervisors\ninteractions with the youth.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n15, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker and Detective.\nStaff 4 reported on March 6, 2023, he was on a different pod than\nwhere the incident occurred. He reported he got notified of the\nlockdown and got his pod of youth into their rooms. Staff 4\nreported he then ran by the control center and asked where the\nincident was and was told to go to C Pod. When he arrived, he\nheard Supervisor tell Staff 2 and Staff 3 to get her on her back\nfrom the restraint. Staff 4 assisted with grabbing Youth A’s legs\nwith Staff 3. He reported Staff 3 did lift Youth A’s legs off the\nground but was redirected by Supervisor to not do that. Supervisor\nand Staff 2 did a CPI team escort of Youth A to her room. He\nreported he did not see anything non-compliant with the restraint\nbesides Staff 3 lifting her legs but that was quickly redirected\nwithin two seconds. Staff 4 reported Youth A did end up flooding\nher room and he had to assist by standing by while Staff 2 and\nStaff 5 cleaned up Youth A’s room. Staff 4 reported he has no\nconcerns with Supervisor’s interactions with the youth or his ability\nto do his job correctly. He reported he has completed restraints\nwith Supervisor before and has had zero concerns.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on March 22, 2023, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nwas escalated because she wanted to use Staff 1’s ink pen and\nshe was not allowing her to do that. She reported Youth A does\n7",
    "not like her because she is strict on the rules and will redirect her\nfor swearing. Youth A began to swear about the situation and Staff\n1 pulled out a behavior chain, which is when a youth needs to\nwrite about their actions and review it with another staff member.\nYouth A continued to get into a power struggle and began to throw\npapers. That was when Supervisor came onto the unit to switch\noout with Staff 1 due to Youth A’s anger being directed towards\nher. She stated she went into the control room where Staff 3 and\nbegan to watch the camera of C Pod. Staff 1 noticed Supervisor\ngive the signal to go onto lockdown and Staff 3 got confused\nabout what to do so Staff 1 took over. She reported Staff 3 left to\ngo support on C Pod. Staff 1 reported when she looked at the\nvideo, she saw Supervisor over by the door with Youth A in the\nrestraint and go down to the floor. She reported she did not see\nthe rest of the video. Staff 1 reported later that night she did check\nin with Youth A and she said she had a knot on her head and her\nhead hurt. She reported she called Supervisor about this and then\nnursing came. Staff 1 reported she felt a bump on Youth A’s head\nabout the size of a nickel. She reported she cannot remember\nwhat Youth A said about how she got it. When asked if this bump\ncould have been caused by her hitting herself in the head before\nthe restraint out of frustration, Staff 1 reported it could have been\nand noted Youth A is not known to do that to herself. Staff 1\nreported she has seen Supervisor in other restraints, and he is\nnever rough with the youth and follows protocol. She reported she\ndoes not have concerns with Supervisor's interactions with the\nyouth but noted he is sterner with them.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n15, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker and Detective.\nStaff 5 reported on March 6, 2023, she was working in a different\npod than where the incident occurred. She reported she could see\ninto the pod and heard Youth A screaming. Staff 5 reported when\nshe got notice of lockdown, she got her youth into their rooms and\nthen went over to Youth A’s pod. When she arrived, Youth A was\nalready in a restraint and was being moved into her room.\nSupervisor and Staff 2 had her arms and Staff 3 and Staff 4 had\nher legs. She reported the only thing she saw that was not\nrestraint compliant was Staff 3 briefly lifting Youth A's legs off the\nground but was quickly redirected by Supervisor. Staff 5 reported\nshe was a part of the staff debrief and Supervisor processed how\nresponse times need to be quicker for the situation. During that\ntime, Youth A began to flood her room, and Staff 5 assisted with\ncleaning and making the area safe for Youth A. Staff 5 reported\nYouth A’s pod is not very fond of Supervisor due to him redirecting\n8",
    "situations. She reported she does not have any concerns with\nSupervisor’s treatment of the youth or his ability to do his job.\nIntern was interviewed via phone on March 22, 2023, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Intern reported she has\nbeen interning at the facility for about 8 months. She reported she\nwitnessed the restraint occur but was not in the pod as per the\nfacility policy she cannot be. She reported she saw Staff 2\ncleaning Youth A’s room and Supervisor and Staff 3 attempted to\nverbally de-escalate Youth A. She reported Youth A then threw\nthe chair and Supervisor went into a restraint. Intern reported it\nlooks like Supervisor was going in for a bear hug, but Youth A\ndropped to the ground on her own. She reported she did see\nSupervisor’s hand near Youth A’s chest. During this time Staff 3\nlooked lost on what to do. Intern reported when they were on the\nground, she lost sight of what was going on due to the table in the\nway. Intern reported she just sat in the CPI training this week to\nlearn more about the process. She reported Supervisor is a good\nstaff and due to his role, he has taken more of a sticker staff role\non the unit.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n15, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth C\nreported she has been at the facility for about two months. On\nMarch 6, 2023, Youth A began screaming at staff over papers and\nstaff told the youth they needed to go into their rooms. She\nreported she heard Supervisor attempt to calm Youth A down.\nYouth C reported most of her window was covered but she did\nsee Supervisor had Youth A in a restraint at one point because\nYouth A threw a chair. She reported she did not really see\nanything but heard the struggle. Youth C reported she feels safe\nat the facility and has no concerns.\nYouth D was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n15, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth D\nreported on March 6, 2023, the pod was doing an awareness\nactivity and Youth A was refusing to do it. Youth A and Staff 1 got\ninto a verbal argument about the refusal and then Supervisor\ncame into the unit. Youth D reported all the youth went into their\nroom and Youth A began to flip chairs. She reported her window\nwas covered but could see Youth A being restrained by\nSupervisor. Youth D reported she saw Youth A turn purple. She\nreported her room is next to Youth A’s room and heard her get\nthrown in her room by Supervisor. Youth D reported she talked\nwith Youth A and she told her about Supervisor choking her and\nthat she had a knot on her head. She reported when she saw\n9",
    "Supervisor, she asked him why he did a “dirty restraint”, and he\ndenied it. Youth D reported the youth on the unit does not like\nSupervisor because he never helps the youth and has a negative\nattitude. To note, after reviewing the video, Youth D’s door is not\nin eyesight of the incident.\nConference call was held with MDHHS Worker on March 29,\n2023. MDHHS worker reported there are no findings to the\ninvestigation.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage regarding the restraint from March 6, 2023,\ninvolving Youth A was reviewed multiple times on March 15, 2023.\nThe video footage was consistent with Supervisor and all staff\ninterviews. The video before the restraint shows Supervisor\nattempting to verbally de-escalate Youth A calmly and her refusing\nto go to her room and stating “you will have to restrain me.” When\nSupervisor is talking with Youth A about a plan she begins to\nscream and hit her head with two closed fists on the top of her\nhead where the knot on her head was noted. Youth A began to\npace around the room and throw chairs. Once Youth A threw a\nchair directly at Supervisor and rushed towards her. Within the\nvideo you see Supervisor and Youth A go against the door/wall\nand a bang sound can be heard but due to Supervisor’s position\nand camera angle it cannot be determined what caused the noise.\nSupervisor attempted to do a standing hold and Youth A’s body\nweight went to the ground. Due to the camera angle, it prevented\nthe ability to see if Youth A or Supervisor hit the wall or the door\nwhen Youth A is dropping to the floor or where Supervisor’s hand\nposition is. Once Youth A and Supervisor are on the floor you hear\nSupervisor call out for assistance and that Youth A needs to get\nonto her back. The video shows Supervisor assisting Youth A’s\nbody to roll and Staff 2 securing Youth A’s shoulder and Staff 3\nand Staff 4 securing her legs. Supervisor then states they need to\nget Youth A up and into her room. This is when you see\nSupervisor and Staff 2 assist with lifting her upper body and Staff\n3 lifting up Youth A’s legs. As they are guiding her to her room,\nYouth A’s legs are off the ground and Supervisor tells the team to\nput her legs down. Once they cross the threshold of Youth A’s\ndoor the team is out of camera angle. From the video standpoint,\nit is believed Youth A’s legs were off the ground for about 5\nseconds before the video cuts off. The video does not show\nSupervisor grabbing Youth A by the neck or punching her.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n10",
