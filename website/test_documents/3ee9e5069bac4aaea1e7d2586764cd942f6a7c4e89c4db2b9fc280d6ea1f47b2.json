    "Onsite Agency visit, met with Director 2 and viewed the agency’s\nclosed files. Discussed possible preliminary findings\n06/10/2022 Inspection Completed- Sub Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency has not submitted records to the Michigan Department of Health and\nHuman Services (MDHHS) for permanent retention one year following the final order\nof adoption as required. There are five records that have not been submitted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/22/2022 I reviewed the complaint, and contact was made with the complainant\nvia email by my Peer Consultant on 5/23/2022. I made initial contact with the\nagency about the complaint via email on 5/24/2022.\nOn 5/25/2022, Adoption Departmental Manager (ADM) X provided information about\nthe complaint to me, and a Peer Consultant, via email. ADM X reported her\ndepartment had been in contact with agencies about their closed adoption records.\nThe department had inquired with the agencies as to the status of the closed\nadoption files requested. Her department found that these files either had not been\nsubmitted to the local office at all or were submitted outside the required timeframe\nof 12 to 13 months following finalization. ADM X listed six finalized adoption files for\nOrchard Children’s Services that may not have been submitted.\nADM X provided clarity on how the files are to be closed and sent to the County\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) office, and the DHS-788 form to\nbe attached on the closed file boxes. Additionally, ADM X provided information with\nrespect to if an agency still has old closed adoption records outside the ones on the\nlist provided related to the complaint; and what that agency should do with those\nrecords. Whether those closed records should come to ADM X’s office or the\nCounty DHHS Office. ADM X reported, when R400.12713 was updated in 2015,\nagencies were instructed to send their backlogged adoption records directly to\nCentral Office. She reported, it has been seven years and at this point agencies\nshould be caught up, and on schedule to send closed records to the local offices\nbetween 12-13 months following finalization. If an agency still has old closed\nadoption records, her office will work with the agency, accept those old records, to\nnot have the local county office bombarded with old records. She advised it would be\nvery helpful if the agency would include in any corrective action plan the agency’s\nplan to ensure that Lansing/the department gets those old records.\nOn 5/24/2022 via telephone, I spoke with Director/Administrator 1 and Director 2.\nDirector 2 was interviewed further by me during an onsite agency visit on 6/9/2022.\nThe two directors reported having several closed adoption files which have not been\nsent to the County Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) offices. They\nreported being aware that the closed records are to go the local DHHS Office, who\nwill combine the adoption record with the child’s foster care record and sent it to\n3",
    "Lansing. The directors expressed that there have been problems with the closed\nadoption file submission process, due to different county offices giving different\ndirections as to how they want the file contents sorted and the record submitted.\nThey also advised of some DHHS offices not accepting the files or rejecting their\nclosed records. They reported sending 40 boxes (for 10-20 children) of closed\nadoption records to DHHS- Western Wayne three months ago, only to have those\nrecords returned to them about one month ago, for the reasons related to how the\nrecord was filed.\nDirector/Administrator 1 and Director 2 acknowledged receiving a list of closed\nadoption records that ADM X’s office inquired about. The directors reported that list\ndid not include all siblings. They noted the latter, because their practice has been to\nwait until the last child had been adopted before forwarding the closed record. They\nreported having more than the six closed adoption files named in the complaint for\nwhich finalization has occurred, and that they are processing to submit to DHHS.\nThey reported having been in touch with four relevant DHHS county offices (North\nCentral, South Central, Macomb, Livingston) and they were waiting to hear back\nfrom these county offices related to the submission and drop off or closed records.\nDirector 2 reported the agency received an email, not a letter from the MDHHS\nAdoption Closed Record Unit in late April 2022 asking for the status of the six closed\nadoption cases. The email requested a respond by 4/27/2022. Director 2 reported\ncontact was made with ADM X and State Adoption Analyst (SAA)T after that email.\nShe advised ADM X’s office the agency had reached out to the local DHHS offices\nfor guidance on submitting the closed records. Also, that the agency had delivered\nChild A’s closed adoption record to Livingston County DHHS on 4/29/2022. At that\ntime, she did not inform ADM X or (SAA)T as to when Child B’s, Child C’s, Child D’s,\nChild E’s or Child F’s closed records would be submitted, because she did not know\nwhen the specific county office could accept them. On 6/9/2022, Director 2 reported\nChild B’s, and Child C’s closed adoption records had been submitted. Director 2\nprovided submission verification of that by way of “Foster Care/Adoption File\nTransfer” receipt forms. The forms showed Child A’s (adoption finalized 10/22/2020)\nclosed adoption record was submitted (to Livingston County DHHS) on 4/28/2022.\nChild B’s and Child C’s (adoptions finalized 10/22/2022) closed adoption records\nwere submitted (to Macomb County DHHS) on 4/29/2022. Child D’s, and Child E’s\n(adoptions finalized 11/6/2020) closed adoption records, as well as three others\nclosed records were submitted (to DHHS- North Central) on 5/24/2022. Submission\nof Child F’s closed adoption record was still pending.\nDirector 2 also reported having 14 boxes of closed adoption record to submit to\nDHHS-Western Wayne, but this county office, will not take closed cases until the\nend of this month. The agency also had three boxes of closed cases to submit to St.\nClair County DHHS: and seven for DHHS-South Central. Additionally, they have 50\nfinalized adoption cases for 2018, which they must sort/compile and submit to\nDHHS. They plan to have these all completed/submitted within the next six months.\n4",
    "During my on-site visit on 6/9/2022, I observed the agency’s secure closed file\nadoption storage room. Director 2 reported the agency’s plan for staying rule\ncompliant going forward is that the agency will utilize the month of June as their\nreflection and submission month. Their managers and clerical unit will run the\nnumber of adoptions finalized within the last 12 months. They will compile the\nnumber of boxes that need to go out and will contact each county DHHS office to\nschedule the drop offs. They will record the submissions with their Foster\nCare/Adoption File Transfer form.\nReviewed\n A copy of the email notice from the MDHHS Adoption Placement Records\nUnit to Director/Adminsitrator 1 related to R400.12713(5); asking about the six\npreviously named adoption records, which were past due for submission\nsince the child’s adoption finalization date. A status update was requested by\n4/27/2022.\n A copy of the Foster Care/Adoption File Transfer receipt forms for adoption\nrecords referenced earlier in this report.\n Copies of emails from the agency to DHHS- Western Wayne on 5/27/2022,\n6/1/2022; and response back from this county office to the agency, related to\ndropping off 14 boxes of files.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12713 Adoption placement record.\n(5) The Michigan department of human services must\npermanently retain all adoption records for children\nadopted from Michigan's child welfare system. The\nadoption agency must forward any adoption records for\nchildren adopted from the Michigan child welfare system to\nthe department one year after finalization of the adoption.\nThe adoption agency may not retain the original copies or\nany other copies of the adoption records.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency did not submit Child A’s Child B’s, Child C’s, Child\nD’s, Child E’s or Child F’s finalized adoption record timely per\nthe rule. Child A’s adoption was finalized on 10/22/2020 and the\nclosed adoption record was submitted on 4/28/2022. Child B’s,\nChild C’s and Child D’s adoptions were also finalized on\n10/22/2020; and their closed adoption records were submitted\non 4/29/2022. Child D’s and Child E’s adoptions were finalized\non 11/6/2020 and their closed record submission occurred on\n5/24/2022. Child F’s adoption was finalized on 10/28/2020, and\nthe closed adoption record submission is pending. Additionally,\nthe agency admitted to having 50 other closed adoption cases\nfor children whose adoptions were finalized in 2018 whose\nclosed adoption record submission is pending.\nThe agency is in violation of the rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date June 29, 2022,\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 1, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n6"
