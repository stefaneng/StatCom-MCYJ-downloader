She reports having contact with\nAdoptive Parent 1 and notes the agency denied him for adoption without\ninterviewing him.\nI reviewed Adoption Manager email dated 08/07/2020. It states Resident A was\nplaced with Adoptive Parent 1 on 08/15/2017 and consequently removed from the\nplacement by MDHHS on 02/09/2018. Home visits occurred on 10/18/17, 10/25/17\nand 01/17/18. Case was pending as agency awaited MDHHS to complete its\nspecial evaluation. The agency sent Adoptive Parent 1 a letter dated 08/16/2019\nrequesting additional documentation with a 14-day response time, which Adoptive\nParent 1 did not respond. The agency proceeded with the DHHS 612 as a denial on\n10/10/2019.\nI reviewed Adoptive Parent 1’s MDHHS adoption application. It was signed by\nAdoptive Parent 1 on 10/12/2017.\nI reviewed Adoptive Parent 1’s MDHHS adoptive family assessment addendum. It\nwas signed on 10/10/2019. The agency did not recommend the adoption of Foster\nChild by Adoptive Parent 1.\n2",
