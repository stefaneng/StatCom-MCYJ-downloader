Youths A and B AWOL on a regular basis.\nINVESTIGATION:\nMethodist Children’s Home is a 60-bed campus-based residential treatment facility\nwith 10 beds designated for short-term shelter. The three youths involved were\nhoused in the shelter program prior to going AWOL per Methodist’s internal census\ndata. Methodist does not seclude youth. The use of seclusion requires written\napproval from the department’s licensing authority, which Methodist has not\nrequested. Per Methodist’s written restraint policy, physical restraint is not permitted\nto prevent escape or truancy.\nYouth A\nA report by Therapist 1 dated 11/17/21 summarized Youth A’s current functioning\nand history prior to placement at Methodist. In Nov 2020, he reportedly assaulted\nhis adoptive mother and was placed in a detention facility. When his mother refused\nto accept him back into her home in Feb 2021, Youth A was placed in the care of\nMDHHS. He remained in detention until April 2021 at which time he was placed at a\nresidential treatment facility. In Aug 2021, that treatment facility requested he be\nremoved due to AWOLs, property destruction, aggressive behaviors, and\nauditory/visual hallucinations. Youth A was then psychiatrically hospitalized for two\nmonths and then placed in Methodist’s short-term shelter on 10/9/21.\nSince his placement at the shelter, Youth A’s behaviors of going AWOL, physically\nintimidating, and becoming aggressive toward peers and staff reportedly continued.\nAccording to Chief Administrator 1, Youth A went AWOL from Methodist 11 times in\n5 weeks.\nI reviewed an individualized safety plan for Youth A authored by Therapist 1\ndeveloped on 10/13/21 and updated on 11/2/21. The plan identified verbal and non-\nverbal cues to warn staff that Youth A is “escalating”. Some identified cues are a\nloss of affect, intimidating female staff, trying to take staff’s phone or keys, becoming\n3",
    "quiet or loud, cursing and destroying property. Staff interventions when Youth A is\nexperiencing auditory or visual hallucinations include maintaining line of sight, verbal\nredirection, speaking in low tones, and telling Youth A the visions and sounds can’t\nhurt him. A cue specific to going AWOL is noticing when a peer or peers encourage\nhim to AWOL. If a peer encourages him to AWOL, staff are to separate him from\nthat peer by engaging him in an activity and watching him closely in the back of the\ncottage as he often leaves out the back door. If Youth A leaves the cottage, staff are\nto follow him. If he leaves the campus or line of sight, staff are to retrieve a vehicle\nand canvas the area. If unable to locate him, staff are to file a police report and\ncontact the appropriate parties.\nYouth A is currently prescribed three different psychotropic medications and\ndescribed as having a “fixation on guns and weapons” and pretends to “shoot\npeople.” Youth A reportedly is in special education for autism and uses nicotine,\nmarijuana, and alcohol.\nOn 11/18/21, I interviewed Youth A, age 13, jointly with Government Worker 1.\nPhysically, he is bigger than average for his age. Youth A presented as cognitively\nimpaired.\nWhen asked about the events on 11/16/21, Youth A was unable to tell a sensible\nstory in a logical sequence. Records indicate he and Youth B walked off campus\ntogether without permission on 11/16/21 at 4pm and then Youth A returned to his\ncottage alone the next morning at 6:45am.\nYouth A was unable to accurately estimate the passage of time. He referred to this\nparticular AWOL as happening last night, Monday night and three weeks ago. He\ncould not explain where or when Youths A, B and C met up after leaving the campus\nseparately. At some point, Youth A said he rode on a bus and in a car. Youth A\nsaid Youth B checked the doors of some parked cars and found that one was\nunlocked. It is unclear if Youth A witnessed this or if someone told him this\nhappened. Youth A said “Youth B was driving…We hopped in…He drove to his\ndad’s house. His dad said, ‘go back’…There were four of us.” Somewhere along\nthe way, he said a fourth youth from the community joined the three boys from\nMethodist. Youth A was unwilling or unable to indicate where or when the fourth\nyouth joined them and did not provide the identity of that youth.\nYouth B\nA report by Therapist 1 dated 11/15/21 indicated that prior to his placement at\nMethodist on 9/29/21, Youth B was psychiatrically hospitalized in June 2021,\nprescribed two psychotropic medications, and had a history of going AWOL,\ndestroying property, and engaging in risky behaviors. During his 7-week stay at\nMethodist, records indicate Youth B went AWOL 11 times.\n4",
    "I reviewed an individualized safety plan for Youth B authored by Therapist 1\ndeveloped on 10/2/21 and updated on 11/2/21. The plan identified verbal and non-\nverbal cues to warn staff he is “escalating.” Some identified cues are pacing, balling\nfists, destroying property, walking out the front door, cursing and arguing. Patterns\nand cues specific to going AWOL were Youth B feeling unhappy he was removed\nfrom his father, and he was known to prefer leaving the campus with others, would\nask the whereabouts of peers and when they’d return. Staff interventions when\nYouth B is “escalated” are to maintain line of sight of Youth B at all times except in\nthe bathroom or shower. Interventions specific to AWOL are encouraging any peer\nwho is easily influenced by him to separate from him by taking the other youth\noutdoors or to an area away from Youth B. If Youth B leaves the cottage, staff are to\nfollow immediately. If he leaves the campus, staff are to get a vehicle and canvas\nthe area. If staff cannot locate Youth B in the community, they are to file a police\nreport and contact the appropriate parties. Upon going AWOL, supervisor or Case\nManager 1 should contact Youth B’s father to notify him that youth has gone AWOL\nand may be on his way to his (father’s) house.\nYouth B, age 11, was not interviewed on 11/18/21 because he was hospitalized in\ncritical condition as a result of a car accident in the community that occurred on\n11/17/21 while he was AWOL from the facility. On 11/26/21, Youth B was\npronounced dead according to information found in MISACWIS log # 86816507.\nYouth C\nYouth C, age 11, was admitted to Methodist on 11/9/21. He was not interviewed\njointly on 11/18/21 because he was hospitalized. According to Government Worker\n1 he was undergoing surgery for a fractured femur. On 11/19/21, Government\nWorker 1 interviewed Youth C at the hospital.\nOn 12/1/21, I interviewed Youth C at the facility. He presented in a wheelchair.\nYouth C’s account of the incident, outlined below, was consistent with what he told\nGovernment Worker 1 on 11/19/21.\nRecords indicate Youth C went AWOL from Methodist for the first time on 11/16/21\nat 5pm. This was his first AWOL, so no special plan was developed to prevent\nAWOLs. Asked about that night, he said he left alone and walked west on Six Mile\nRoad toward Livonia. He did not leave with Youth B or C and was not present to\nwitness a car being driven off Methodist’s property. Youth C said he returned to the\ngrounds alone after dark but did not make his presence known to staff. On the\ngrounds, he noticed Youth A running around outdoors. The two boys talked on the\nplayscape and decided to walk off-campus again, this time together. The two boys\nwalked east on Six Mile Road toward Detroit. “We walked for an hour and caught a\nbus.” Coincidentally he said Youth B, who had gone AWOL before him, was a\npassenger on that same bus. According to Youth C, the three boys exited the bus\ntogether near Youth B’s father’s home. Youth B reportedly went into the house\n5",
    "alone and retrieved some car keys. The three boys and a fourth older youth from\nthe community got into a car. Youth C said he did not know who the car belonged\nto. The older boy from the community drove the younger ones around and made a\nnumber of stops throughout the night. Youth C said he fell asleep and woke up\nwhen the car he was riding in crashed.\nStaff 1\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Chief Impact Officer (CIO\n1) present. On the day of the incident, Staff 1 worked in the shelter cottage (Ott)\nfrom 11am to 7pm.\nAround 4pm, Staff 1 said Therapist 1 and Youth A exited the cottage and Youth B\nexited behind them without permission. Staff 1 followed all of them to the nurse’s\nbuilding. Therapist 1 and Youth A went inside the building while Staff 1 remained\noutdoors with Youth B. Youth B started pushing on a window of the building.\nTherapist 1 attempted to lock the window from the inside. Youth B waited for Youth\nA to exit the building. Youth A exited alone, and the two boys began walking\ntogether in the opposite direction of their cottage. Staff 1 followed them encouraging\nthem to return. The boys refused and continued walking. They reached Six Mile\nRoad and headed east. Staff 1 followed them until they disappeared from sight.\nStaff 1 notified Supervisor 1 that the boys had gone AWOL then she returned to Ott\nCottage. She said Supervisor 1 took a vehicle, looked for the boys and then filed a\nmissing person’s report with the Redford Police.\nAround 4:30pm, Staff 1 was in the cottage and looked outside. She saw Youths A\nand B back on the grounds running and hiding. Staff 1 notified her co-workers and\nsupervisor that she saw the boys back on the grounds, but they were not officially\nchecked in and were still on AWOL status.\nStaff 1 stated she was aware of the individualized safety plans for Youths A and B.\nShe said she reviewed them with her supervisor and that they were kept in a binder\nin Ott Cottage. Prior to Youth B exiting the cottage behind Youth A without\npermission, Staff 1 noticed nothing unusual about Youth B’s behavior. While outside\nthe nurse’s building with Youth B, she said she intervened by asking Youth B why he\nwanted to see Youth A so badly and reminded him that he would see Youth B back\nto their cottage. Then Staff 1 asked Youth B if there was anything else he wanted to\ndo to pass the time instead of waiting for Youth A outside the nurse’s building.\n“Youth B was fixated on following Youth A and ignored me. He said he wanted to\nhurt or shoot staff.”\nWhen Youth A came out of the nurse’s building, Staff 1 recalled Youth B encouraged\nYouth A to “come with him.” Then the boys walked away from their cottage and\ntoward Six Mile Road with Staff 1 following a few feet behind them. Staff 1 offered\n6",
    "Youth A options for other activities and asked him why he wanted to leave. “He\nsaid, ‘because Youth B is leaving.’”\nAt approximately 5pm, Staff 1 said Youth C ran out of Ott Cottage without\npermission and refused to come in. “I looked for him on grounds and couldn’t locate\nhim. I got a vehicle and drove around campus. I scanned one block both ways\ndown Six Mile and couldn’t find him. I went to Redford Police Department and filed a\nreport.”\nTherapist 1\nI interviewed Therapist 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 and CIO 1 present. She\nsaid she took Youth A from Ott cottage to the nurse’s building to clean a scratch on\nhis neck. “Youth B followed us, and staff (Staff 1) was with him. I was inside\ncleaning Youth A’s neck. Youth B was outside opening and closing a window. I\nasked him to close the window.” When she finished with Youth A, Therapist 1 said\nshe released him outside to Staff 1 and stayed inside the building to clean up.\n“When I came out, they (Staff 1, Youth A and B) were gone.”\nClinical Director 1\nI interviewed Clinical Director 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 and CIO 1 present.\nThat morning, CD 1 said he parked his 2016 Ford Fusion on the deep end of the\nadministrative parking lot at the front of the campus. He said he typically leaves his\nkeys in his car and locks the door from the outside using a digital code. On\n11/16/21, CD 1 said he thought he locked his car, but when he went to leave at 5pm,\nhe could not find it. He looked around and realized it was gone. “I called the\nRedford police and reported it stolen (#210023325). The next morning, CD 1 called\nthe Redford police. “They referred me to the Ferndale Police Department.” The\nFerndale police notified him that his vehicle had been involved in a crime and there\nwas a “hold” on it.\nNeither Youth A nor C reported being inside or outside of the vehicle when it was\ndriven off Methodist’s property. There are no other known youths or staff who\nwitnessed the vehicle being driven off the property.\nAs of 11/16/21, Methodist did not have a policy that specifically mandates staff to\nsecure their personal vehicles and/or maintain possession of their keys while on duty\nat the facility.\nCase Manager 1\nI interviewed Case Manager 1. He has worked at Methodist for six months. When\nYouth B went AWOL on 11/16/21 at 4pm, he said he attempted to reach Youth B’s\nfather by telephone, but there was no answer. Case Manager 1 could not recall if he\n7",
    "left a voice message at that time. The next morning Case Manager 1 said he\nsuccessfully reached Youth B’s father by phone.\nA case note in MISACWIS indicated Case Manager 1 notified the referral source\n(MDHHS) of Youth B’s AWOL on 11/16/21 at 11:41pm.\nI reviewed the shelter’s program statement dated 3/24/21 which indicates “the\nprogram provides temporary, short-term residential and diagnostic services to youth\neligible for funding based on MDHHS criteria, males ages 13-17…and serves as a\ntransitional placement. The staff to resident ratio during waking hours is 1:4 and\n1:10 during sleeping hours. Service duration is targeted for 30 days. In some\ninstances, and with approval from MDHHS, youth will be permitted to remain longer\ndue to barriers encountered in the referral/placement process (i.e., waiting list,\nspecial needs placement) and/or delays in MDHHS processing. In no case can a\nchild remain for more than 45 days. If MCHS (Methodist Children’s Home Society)\ndetermines a youth is inappropriate for the program, MCHS will submit a request for\nremoval to MDHHS…\nYouth identified as needing intensive psychiatric care or medically fragile are not\neligible for admission. For example, this would include youth who would require\nimmediate one-to-one supervision, who are in active psychosis, actively suicidal,\nand/or are in need of active psychiatry care. Medically fragile youth would include\nyouth with a chronic physical condition that requires daily skilled nursing\nintervention, need life-sustaining medication and equipment, or would require\nspecialized equipment that medical facilities have, such as IV poles, feeding pumps,\nand medical supplies that exceed what is expected of residential care. MCHS is an\nopen, non-secure program, located on a campus in a highly populated western\nsuburb of Detroit. Youth with histories of AWOL may not be appropriate.”\nPrior to their placement at Methodist, both Youths A and B had recent psychiatric\nhospitalizations and histories of going AWOL from other facilities. Youth A had just\nbeen released from a psychiatric hospital and there was a plan on how staff should\nrespond to his active hallucinations. This suggests that Youth A may have still\nneeded “intensive psychiatric care” at the time of his placement and thus, been\ninappropriate for Methodist’s shelter.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n8",
    "(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, and discharge of residents.\nANALYSIS: The agency has written procedures on how staff are to respond\nwhen youths walk off the campus without permission. The staff\nfollowed those procedures. There are no policies mandating\nstaff to lock their personal vehicles or keep their keys in a\ndesigned place when their vehicles are not in use.\nThe program statement for Methodist’s shelter indicates “Youth\nidentified as needing intensive psychiatric care are not eligible\nfor admission.” Although Youth A may have still required\nintensive psychiatric care at the time of his admission to the\nshelter, Methodist accepted him aware that he had just spent\ntwo months in a psychiatric hospital.\nThe shelter program statement also indicates “Youth with\nhistories of AWOL may not be appropriate.” Youths A and B\nboth had histories of AWOLing from other facilities prior to their\nplacement at Methodist’s shelter. Furthermore, at the time of\nthis incident both boys had already gone AWOL from the facility\nat least eleven times.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRepeat Violations\nSIR2021C0207027 - intake 8/18/21; CAP approved 10/27/21\nSIR2021C0108034 – intake 4/20/21; CAP approved 5/11/21\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n9",
    "ANALYSIS: There is no evidence the facility failed to follow Methodist’s\npolicy with regard to AWOLs in general. All of the youths were\nfollowed off campus until Staff 1 lost sight of them, and then\nmissing person’s reports were filed with the Redford Police,\nwhich is consistent with Methodist’s Critical Incident Reporting\npolicy.\nOn 11/16/21, safety plans that addressed AWOL behaviors for\nYouths A and B were in effect. For Youth A, behavioral cues\nspecific to AWOL included staff noticing when he was being\ninfluenced by a peer or peers to AWOL, and staff watching him\nclosely near the back of the cottage as he is known to leave out\nthe back door. Behavioral cues specific to AWOL for Youth B\nwere staff noticing when he felt unhappy about being removed\nfrom his father, him asking the whereabouts of peers, and staff\nnoticing him encouraging peers to AWOL with him.\nBased on the interview of Staff 1, she intervened appropriately\nafter she identified the behavioral cues of both youths that\nprecede AWOL. Specifically, Youth B was “fixated” on following\nYouth A out of the cottage without permission, Youth A is easily\ninfluenced by peers, Youth B preferred to AWOL with others and\nYouth B verbally encouraged Youth A to AWOL by asking him to\n“come with him.”\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDING:\nMethodist’s 10-bed shelter is licensed by the Division of Child Welfare Licensing to\nserve males ages 13 – 17. Youths B and C were age 11 when they were admitted\nto the shelter, which is noncompliant with the terms of their license.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4104 Rules compliance.\n(2) After being licensed, an institution shall, on an ongoing\nbasis, comply with the act, child caring institution rules,\nand terms of the license.\n10",
    "ANALYSIS: The licensing terms for Methodist’s short-term shelter program\nis males ages 13 – 17. Youths B and C were age 11 when\nadmitted, which is noncompliant with the terms of their license.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the severity of the violations, once an acceptable corrective action plan is\nreceived, I recommend this facility be placed on a First Provisional license.\nJanuary 10, 2021\n_______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 10, 2022\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n11"
