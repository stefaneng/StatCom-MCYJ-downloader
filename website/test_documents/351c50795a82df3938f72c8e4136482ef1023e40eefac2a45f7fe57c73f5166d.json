Staff 1 and 2 were not providing proper supervision.\nINVESTIGATION:\nResident J, age 15, is a DHHS abuse/neglect ward in the Human Trafficking program.\nShe has resided in Beata Hall for seven months. I interviewed her by phone on 4/7/20\nwith the agency’s Rights Advisor present. Resident J said she and Resident E planned\nto be alone together when an opportunity presented itself. She considers Resident E\nher “girlfriend.”\nLast week between 7 – 8 pm, Resident J asked to go to bed early. She said Resident E\nwas with the group in the general area and asked to use the bathroom. Instead of going\n2",
    "to the bathroom, Resident E entered Resident J’s room. Resident J said the girls kissed\nand gave each other hickeys on the neck. “Resident E gave me oral,” she added.\nResident E stayed in Resident J’s room for approximately 10 minutes.\nI asked Resident J what staff were supervising that night. She said Staff 1 and 2 were\nsupposed to be monitoring but they were not paying attention.\nResident E, age 17, is a DHHS abuse/neglect ward in the Cognitively Impaired\nprogram. She has resided in Beata Hall for five months. She has a history of sexual\nacting out at the facility.\nI interviewed Resident E by phone on 4/7/20 with the agency’s Rights Advisor present.\nShe admitted she and Resident J had planned to be alone together. Last week,\nResident E said she walked out of the general area without Staff 1 and 2 noticing and\nentered Resident J’s room. In the room, the girls gave each other hickeys and “I ate her\nout.” Resident E told her therapist what she did, and Resident J was moved to a\ndifferent wing.\nRights Advisor 1 provided a photo taken on 4/7/20 showing what appeared to be the\nremnants of a hickey on Resident E’s neck.\nI interviewed Staff 1 by phone on 4/7/20 with the agency’s Rights Advisor present. He\nhas worked at the facility for two weeks. Staff 1 did not specifically recall a time when\nResident J went to her room early and Resident E asked to use the bathroom. He said\nhe did not see Resident E enter or exit Resident J’s room.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone on 4/7/20 with the agency’s Rights Advisor present. She\nhas worked at the facility for two weeks. If Resident E entered Resident J’s room, Staff\n2 said she was not aware of it. She said it may have happened when she was assisting\nanother staff handle the behaviors of her assigned one-to-one.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n3",
    "ANALYSIS: During the first week of April 2020 Resident E entered Resident\nJ’s room without Staff 1 or 2 noticing. Both girls admitted this\nwas planned.\nInside of the room, Resident E and J said they engaged in\nmutual and consensual sexual behavior. A photo of Resident\nE’s neck showed what appeared to be the remnants of a hickey.\nAt the time of the incident, Staff 1 and 2 had only worked at the\nfacility for two weeks. A third staff person was present.\nHowever she was assigned to monitor a resident one-to-one.\nStaff 1 and 2 failed to provide adequate supervision of\nResidents E and J.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nApril 14, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 14, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
