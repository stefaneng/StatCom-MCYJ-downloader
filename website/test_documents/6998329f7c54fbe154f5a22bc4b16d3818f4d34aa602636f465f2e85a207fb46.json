    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules\nexcept for the following:\nR 400.12306 Application request.\n(4) An agency shall document that the licensee has been given\nan application for renewal of the license not less than 60\ncalendar days before the expiration date of the license.\nOne of eight licensing files did not meet this requirement. The license was due for\nrenewal by 6/11/19. However, the application was provided on 5/1/19, only 41 days\nbefore expiration.\nR 400.12326 Borrowed home.\n(1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by another\nagency or tribe, the agency shall have a record containing all of\nthe following documents:\n(d) A copy of the current reevaluation with written\nendorsement by the borrowing agency that the evaluation is\nacceptable.\nOne of three borrowed home records did not meet this requirement. The 10/23/18\nannual evaluation for the home was received, but not endorsed by staff at the\nagency.\nThis is a repeat violation- 6/23/18 interim review; CAP approved 8/7/18.\nR 400.12326 Borrowed home.\n(2) The borrowing agency is responsible for securing the items\nidentified in subrules (1) (d), (e), (g), (h), and (i) of this rule\nannually for the duration of the child’s placement.\n(1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by another\nagency or tribe, the agency shall have a record containing all of\nthe following documents:\n(g) A copy of the foster parent /agency agreement signed by\nthe foster parent and the borrowing agency.\n4",
    "One of three borrowed bed records did not meet this requirement. A Foster Parent\nAgency Agreement was signed in April 2018. A new agreement should have been\nsigned in April 2019, when the annual evaluation was completed.\nThis is a repeat violation- 6/23/18 interim review; CAP approved 8/7/18.\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(1) An agency's medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(a) The provision of routine medical care.\n(b) The provision of emergency medical, surgical, and dental\ncare.\n(c) A physical examination for each child as follows, unless a\ngreater frequency is medically indicated:\n(i) For a child under 2 years of age, a physical\nexamination shall have been completed within 3 months before\nbeing placed in foster care or a new physical examination shall\nbe completed within 30 calendar days after being placed in\nfoster care.\nOne of eight files did not meet this requirement.\nThe youth was returned home from March to November 2018. Upon re-entering care\non 11/14/18, the youth was due for an 18-month check-up. In addition, the rule\nrequires a physical exam within 3 months prior to placement, or within 30 days of\nplacement. The youth’s prior medical exam was on 2/20/18, and did not meet this\nrequirement. Therefore, a new medical was due by 12/14/18. The youth did not\nreceive this exam until 1/11/19. The agency reported that the delay was due to the\nbirth mother calling the doctor’s office directly and cancelling visits scheduled by the\nrelative caregiver. The worker reported explaining the requirement to the mother\nseveral times, however she was reluctant to allow the appointment. After several\ndiscussions, the mother allowed the appointment. However, the appointment was\nthen late.\nR 400.12603 Policy and procedures\nThe agency shall document that the policies and procedures\nwere provided to all persons making inquiry about the agency’s\nservices.\n5",
    "Four of six prospective adoptive family case files did not meet this requirement.

The facility is in\ncompliance with all additional ISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a MDHHS Contract violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MDHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included in\nsection 1. The facility is in compliance with all additional MDHHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements except for the following:\nFOM 722-06h Caseworker contact\nAll casework contacts must be entered in MiSACWIS, this\nincludes attempted contacts and missed appointments, and all\npertinent information obtained must be summarized and\nincluded in the appropriate section of the case service plan.

A replacement\n2. Termination from foster care placement\n3. A change in FC worker\n8",
    "4. Agency change/transfer to another FC\nagency\n5. A change in a parent’s living situation\n6. Foster care transfer to adoption.\nOne of two closed foster care records did not have a closing summary (DHHS 69)\non file.\nThis is a repeat violation- 6/23/18 interim review; CAP approved 8/7/18.\nFOM 722-08C Parent agency treatment plan and service agreement\nPage 2\nUpon completion of the parent-agency treatment plan and\nservice agreement, the parent is given a copy for review. Foster\ncare workers need to ensure the parent understands all areas\nwithin the agreement. Parents and youths age 14 and older\nmust sign the PATP. If a parent or youth is unavailable or\nrefuses to sign the PATP, foster care workers must identify and\ndocument additional action needed to secure the parent’s\nand/or youth’s participation in service planning and compliance\nwith the PATP. As the goals are achieved, modified or\nexpanded, the updated PATP will reflect this process. Parents\nand youths age 14 and older must participate in the\ndevelopment of each updated treatment plan, allowing for\nopportunity to evaluate their progress towards completing goals.\nThe individual activities required by the foster parent/caregiver\nto meet the specific individual needs of the child placed in their\nhome are included in the PATP. The foster parent/caregiver\nmust be included in the PATP process. The foster\nparent/caregiver signature is required and indicates that the\nfoster parent/caregiver acknowledges and agrees to the\nactivities required to meet the needs of the child in their care.\nAdditionally, the PATP details the services and activities\nprovided by the foster care worker to assist the foster\nparent/caregiver in caring for the child.\nCI 17-099\nWhen the treatment plan is completed, signatures for all\nappropriate case members must be obtained. Signatures from\nall appropriate case members, including youth ages 14 and\nolder for foster care and youth ages 11 and older for juvenile\njustice, should be obtained before the corresponding court\nhearing. All treatment plans with a report date of August 1,\n2017, or later must have signatures from all appropriate case\nmembers within 30 days of the report date.\n9",
    "Eleven of twenty one PATPs did not have signatures by parents or foster parents,\nwithin the required 30 day timeframe.\nFile 1:\n12/13/18 PATP- Foster parent signed 2/5/19, mom signed 2/5/19\nFile 2:\n4/22/19 PATP- Missing parent signature.

ANALYST SAFETY REVIEW:\nFoster parent 3 reported not receiving a medical passport. Foster parent\nreported not participating in a family team meeting or providing input and\nsigning the case service plan.\nThe case record was reviewed and found that the case was transferred from DHHS\nto HATW 1/16/19. Medical passports were provided to and signed by the foster\nparent on 1/31/19, 2/11/19, and 6/17/19. In addition, it was determined that the\nfoster parent participated in an FTM on 4/15/19. The FTM form is signed by both\nfoster parents. Lastly, the foster parent signed the 1/16/19 and 4/16/19 PATPs,\nindicating that they were involved with planning and received a copy of the service\nplan. Therefore, the agency is found to be in compliance regarding these concerns.\nHowever, there is one violation due to late PATP signatures. The FP signed the\n1/16/19 and 4/16/19 PATP on 6/13/19. As these were not signed within 30 days of\nreport completion, this is a violation of FOM 722-08C, as noted in the above findings.\nFoster parent 4 reported not receiving a medical passport. Foster parent\nreported not providing input and signing the case service plan.\n10",
    "A review of the case record found that the case transferred to HATW on 4/26/19.\nDocumentation in the file shows that the foster parent was provided with a medical\npassport at the first home visit on 4/30/19.\nRegarding the concern of lack of foster parent input, the FP participated in an FTM\non 5/22/19, and has been active in conversation with the caseworker during visits.\nDue to this case transferring in April 2019, the first PATP was just completed. The\nPATP was then signed by the foster parent on 6/20/19, after the analyst visit. Any\nconcerns about not being involved in or signing the PATP prior to April were the\nresponsibility of the previous agency.\nRelative 6 reported that the foster care worker has made only 4 unannounced\nvisits in 3 1/2 years. The relative reported that there is no monthly sibling\nvisitation taking place.\nA review of the case file found that this case transferred to HATW 11/8/18, therefore\nany concerns that took place greater than seven months ago, are the responsibility\nof the previous agency.\nThe case file detailed unannounced home visits on 1/3/19, 4/12/19. Sibling visits\noccurred on 11/27/18, 12/18/18, 1/29/19, 2/19/19, 3/28/19 and 4/17/19. The sibling\nwas then adopted on 4/10/19 and sibling visits were no longer required by policy.\nIn foster home 7, one of the foster children reported not to be involved in the\ndevelopment of their service plan as well as not participating in any semi-\nannual transitional meetings.\nA review of the case record found that this case transferred to HATW on 8/2/18.\nSince transferring to this agency, the youth signed and received copies of 5/4/18,\n8/2/18, 11/27/18, 1/29/19, and 4/25/19 PATPs. The youth participated in semi-\nannual transition meetings (FTM) on 11/27/18 and 5/10/19. However, it was noted\nthat the youth did not attend any other service plan FTMs.\nV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following area:\nBorrowed Beds- Two of three borrowed home records held placement lists which\nappear to match the most recent annual/renewal inspection report. However, the\nplacement lists were undated. Therefore, it could not be determined when they were\nupdated, to confirm compliance with rule 326 (2). The agency was advised to\nrequest updated placement records with each annual/renewal, and date the\nplacement list on the day it is received.\nVI. CONSULTATION\nThe agency did not require consultation during this review.\n11",
    "VII. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nOn 12/7/18 a Special Evaluation was initiated due to an allegation that an adult\nhousehold member had duct taped a child’s mouth, and handcuffed his wrists to a\nbed at night. Upon investigation with DHHS, the foster home was found to be in\nviolation of licensing rules and revocation was recommended on 3/7/19. Based on\nthe information contained in the SER, it appears the agency completed a thorough\nevaluation and made a proper recommendation.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nOn 11/7/18 a Special Evaluation was initiated due to an allegation that the foster\nparents physically discipline the children in the home. Upon investigation with\nDHHS, the foster home was found to be in violation of licensing rules due to\nspanking the children in the home. A Corrective Action Plan was developed and\ncompleted by the foster parents. Discipline continues to be monitored by the foster\ncare worker and licensing worker. Based on the information in the SER, the agency\ncompleted a thorough evaluation and took the proper steps to educate the foster\nparents and monitor the home for safety concerns.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP was required after the July 2018 interim review. The CAP, approved\n8/7/2018, addressed the violations found during the interim review. The CAP was\nreferenced while completing the current renewal evaluation and found that few\nrepeat violations occurred. Overall, the agency appears to be following their 2018\nCAP, as shown through improvement in several areas.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules, ISEP requirements, and contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\nJuly 16, 2019\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\n12",
