INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10157 Health services; policies and\nSection procedures.\nDescription Health services; policies and procedures\n(1) A facility shall establish and follow written health service\npolicies and procedures that address all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical and dental care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A's testicles have been hurting for the past two weeks. An\nunknown nurse only gave Youth A Tylenol, and a medical exam\nwas neglected to be given to him. When Youth A was finally seen\nby a doctor on 05/23/2025, Youth A had to be sent to the\nemergency department due to there being no blood flow and\nYouth A's testicles were necrotic. Youth A needs to now have\nsurgery on 05/24/20225, to have his testicles removed. Medical\nstaff have noted this could have been avoidable if Youth A was\nbrought in prior.\nInvestigation Administrator 1 was interviewed face-to-face with MDHHS\nWorker at the facility on 5/29/2025. He reported being aware of\nthe situation with Youth A and Administrator 2 was informed of the\nsituation prior to Administrator 1 being informed. He reported\nNurse has been suspended from duties until this investigation is\ncompleted. Nurse will not be at the facility as part of the\nsuspension. He reported Nurse is the individual who makes the\ndecision if a youth needs hospitalization and if Nurse is not\navailable, administration will make the decision. He reported\nNurse did not see Youth A as presenting with a medical\nemergency. Administrator 1 reported observing and speaking with\n2",
    "Youth A in the school classroom between 5/14/25 and 5/23/25\n(unable to identify specific day) and Youth A never mentioned\nhaving any pain or medical issues.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed face-to-face with MDHHS\nWorker at the facility on 5/29/2025. He reported having Nurse’s\nnotes covering the time from 5/14/25 to 5/23/25 and will provide\ncopies of the notes. He reported on 5/14/25 or 5/15/25, having\nYouth A approach Administrator 2 and saying he was in pain to\nwhich Administrator 2 contacted Nurse. He reported Youth A\nrefused to be examined by Nurse even when a male staff was\noffered to be present. He reported understanding Youth A had\ninformed Nurse that he was feeling better with no pain. He\nreported Youth A would approach Administrator 2 almost every\nother day to say he was in pain and pain relief and ice was offered\nbut Youth A continued to refuse any medical help. The Monday\nbefore Youth A went to the hospital, he was engaged in playing\nbasketball and Nurse informed Administrator 2 that if it was\nserious, Youth A would not be engaged in playing basketball. On\nTuesday of that week, Youth A reported having pain and on\nWednesday, Youth A reported it was hurting more, that Friday,\nYouth A was taken to the medical bus where the treating\nphysician (Med Bus Physician) indicated Youth A needs to be\nseen at the hospital. Administrator 2 believes part of the delay is\nthe facility had just experienced a “rash of youth wanting Nurse to\ncheck their private areas” and it appeared to be an effort to\nmanipulate Nurse. He reported if Nurse had told staff to take\nYouth A to the hospital, administration would back this action\ncompletely. Administrator 2 reported there has been no discipline\nwith Nurse since she began her employment at the facility. He\nreported Nurse informed him that Youth A had told her, Youth A\nhurt his private area when he bumped against the sink in the\nbedroom.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with the\nMDHHS Worker on 5/29/2025. Youth A reported the pain began\nabout 2 weeks ago and was caused after playing basketball.\nYouth A reported telling Nurse the next day and receiving pain\nmedication. Youth A reported the pain increased the following day\nand Youth A told Nurse Youth A needed to be placed on the\nmedical bus and taken to the hospital because Youth A had pain\nin his groin area. Youth A reported getting on the medical bus the\nnext Friday (medical bus only comes every other Friday) and\nbeing taken to the hospital after that. Youth A reported\ncomplaining of the pain daily and never telling anyone he felt\nbetter. Youth A reported some staff (unable to identify which staff)\n3",
    "would ask Youth A why Youth A is “walking that way”. Youth A\nreported telling Staff 1 and Staff 4 about the pain and having them\ntell Youth A to “get some rest” before they told Nurse. Youth A\nidentified telling Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, and Supervisor 3\nabout Youth A’s pain and reported they each said they would look\ninto it but “nothing ever happened”. Youth A reported Nurse told\nYouth A a male staff can come in and check, but Youth A\ndeclined. Youth A reported feeling safe at the facility but also\nfeeling neglected. The treatment program is helping Youth A make\nchanges and Youth A hopes to be released within 6-9 months.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with the\nMDHHS Worker on 5/29/2025. He reported being told only once\nby Youth A that Youth A had pain in Youth A’s groin area but was\nunable to identify a specific day or date. Staff 1 informed Nurse of\nthis issue and Nurse responded by coming down to Youth A’s\nroom to check on Youth A. Staff 1 reported hearing (unable to\nidentify who told him) that Nurse asked to see the injury, but Youth\nA refused Nurse. Staff 1 reported having no knowledge of the\ncause of Youth A’s injury.\nNurse was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with the\nMDHHS Worker on 6/3/2025. She reported first receiving a call\nfrom Youth A on 5/14/25 and when arriving to Youth A’s room,\nYouth A informed her Youth A’s “balls hurt”. She reported Youth A\nhad difficulty explaining the type of pain, so she went through a\nseries of questions. Youth A reported not touching himself and\nthere was no specific aggravation of Youth A’s “balls”. Youth A\ntold Nurse, Youth A believes he bumped himself while sleeping.\nBecause Youth A refused Nurse to examine his groin, Nurse\nprovided pain medication and ice. The next day (5/15/25), Nurse\nreported receiving another call that Youth A was having chest\npains, so Youth A was removed from his room, and she began\nchecking Youth A’s vitals but Youth A then informed Nurse, Youth\nA’s “balls” hurt, not Youth A’s chest. Nurse reported Youth A\nasked to go to the hospital and Nurse reported “I don’t just send\nkids to the hospital”. She asked to examine Youth A’s testicles\nwith a male staff present and Youth A declined. She reported\ndoing a google search into the symptoms that Youth A described\n(twisting balls) and what she found didn’t match what Youth A was\ndescribing. She found that if Youth A had “twisting balls”, Youth A\nwould not be able to walk. She reported getting feedback about\n“blue balls” from Administrator 2 and Administrator 3, but this also\ndidn’t match what Youth A was reporting because it was caused\nby masturbating and Youth A denied doing so. She reported\nYouth A kept saying he wanted to go to the hospital and Nurse\n4",
    "spoke to Supervisor 3 about this and Supervisor 3 went to speak\nwith Youth A. Nurse reported she “can’t just send Youth A to the\nhospital for bumping his testicles in his sleep” since he has not\nbeen examined. Nurse reported leaving work for a couple of days\nwith the assumption that Youth A would have been taken to the\nhospital if the condition worsen. When she returned to work on\n5/16/25 she reported observing Youth A laughing with peers and\nonly asking for tums as the only medical interaction that day. She\nreported a belief that the issue was resolved at that time, because\nof Youth A’s laughing and having no pain. Nurse reported on\n5/17/25 she came in on Saturday and observed Youth A playing\nbasketball and interacting with others. Youth A never called Nurse\nthat day and didn’t report any pain. Nurse reported overhearing\nYouth A speak to his mother during a phone call and discussing\nsomething about “balls and hospital”. Nurse reported telling Youth\nA to stop being silly and to leave his mother alone. She believed\nYouth A was joking with his mother. Nurse reported returning to\nwork after two days off on 5/20/25 and when passing medication\nto another youth on the pod, having Youth A ask for pain\nmedication because of a headache. She reported Youth A said he\nstill has testicle pain and asked when Nurse was going to take him\nto the hospital. Nurse reported telling Youth A she can’t take him\nto the hospital without doing an examination. Later that day\n(5/20/2025), Nurse observed Youth A walking and shifting his\nweight while walking. She reported Youth A was smiling so she\nwas “not sure what to make of it”. On the same day, she reported\na pencil was missing from the classroom Youth A attended so this\nresulted in all the youth being lined up for a body search for the\npencil. Nurse reported Youth A was in the front of the line for the\nsearch so she believed that finally someone would be able to\nmake an observation of Youth A’s testicles. She reported being\nsurprised when no one contacted her later about what they\nobserved when searching Youth A and Youth A never asked for\nmedical care the rest of the day. Nurse found out after Youth A\nwas taken to the hospital, that Youth A was never searched\nbecause he was taken out of line for a court hearing and while at\ncourt, the pencil was found so the search was called off. Following\nthe court hearing, Nurse reported receiving an email from\nProbation Officer that Youth A stated in court he had a medical\nproblem that was not being addressed. She reported responding\nto Probation Officer that she knew something about Youth A\nbumping himself or masturbating as the cause. Probation Officer\ntold Nurse, Youth A may have “twisted ball” as the cause.\nProbation Officer informed Nurse that when visiting Youth A, he\nfound Youth A “touching himself with Youth A’s hand down Youth\nA’s pants while smiling. Nurse believed this supported her belief\n5",
    "that it was not a real medical issue because of the laughing,\njoking, and activities Youth A was engaged in. Nurse reported\nAdministrator 2 informed her to have Youth A seen on the medical\nbus because Youth A brought this issue up during the court\nhearing, so she placed his name on the medical bus. Nurse\nreported Youth A was seen on the medical bus on 5/23/25\n(medical bus comes every 2 weeks on a Friday). Youth A was\ndisplaying no signs of distress and was laughing and joking while\non the bus. After the examination by the doctor on the bus, it was\ndetermined that Youth A needed surgery immediately which\ncaused Nurse to “panic” and she informed Supervisor 6 (who was\npresent) that Youth A needs to go to the hospital immediately.\nYouth A was taken to the hospital by Staff 2 but was laughing and\njoking the whole time. Nurse reported asking Youth A why he\ndidn’t want to be examined with a male staff present and Youth A\ntold her that Youth A now gets it. Nurse reported telling Youth A\nshe was proud Youth A told the truth. Nurse reported not seeing\nYouth A again until his release from the hospital. Nurse was asked\nabout the delay in treatment for Youth A and how she made this\ndecision. Nurse reported once she found out the seriousness of\nYouth A’s condition, he received medical care in 15-minutes. She\nreported not recommending medical care because Youth A kept\nrefusing to be examined and had a history of lying about things,\nhis emotional presentation of laughing and joking around, and\nplaying basketball. She believed he had been searched prior to\ngoing to court but found out after the medical bus examination that\nYouth A had not been searched. Nurse reported examining Youth\nA with a male staff present, post operation and everything looked\nfine. Nurse was asked what she would have done differently, and\nshe reported she would have asked for an examination again and\nasked if another staff, other than Administrator 3, would work for\nYouth A. She reported she would not have listened to the male\nstaff about the condition and possible cause.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with the\nMDHHS Worker on 6/3/2025. She reported being the staff\nproviding supervision for Youth A when he was taken to the\nhospital. She reported having no forehand knowledge about the\nsituation with Youth A because she was on vacation, but did see\nYouth A the day before the medical bus and hospital. She asked\nYouth A why he was walking funny and Youth A told her he was\ninjured but didn’t know how. She reported Youth A told her he\nbegan to experience pain but didn’t say anything right away\nbecause he believed the pain would stop. She reported Youth A\nsaid it was a couple of days before saying something to staff,\nsupervisors, or Nurse. She reported Youth A told her the first staff\n6",
    "he told was Staff 1 who acknowledged being told. She reported\nYouth A was in “good spirits” while in the hospital and didn’t act\nlike he was in pain.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with\nthe MDHHS Worker on 6/3/2025. She reported the only issue\nshe witnessed was when she was passing medication with Staff 4\nand Youth A was lying on his mat on the floor. Youth A acted like\nit was trouble to get up, but she was unable to recall what Youth A\nsaid to her. She did offer to get Youth A some pain relief if\nneeded. She was unable to recall his response. She believes this\nmay have occurred on 5/18/25. She reported Staff 4 informed her\nthat earlier in the day, Youth A was up for activities and not\nstruggling to move. Supervisor 1 reported having no concerns with\nNurse responding to medical issues when called and she is able\nto call Nurse after hours if needed and Nurse will respond. She\nreported Nurse is new at the facility and receives many calls from\nthe youth. Supervisor 1 described Youth A as a youth who has\nhad many concerns and seeks much attention. It is hard to tell if\nYouth A is being “truthful and genuine”.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with\nthe MDHHS Worker on 6/3/2025. He reported limited interactions\nwith Youth A but never heard Youth A asking for the Nurse during\nthese interactions. He reported the interactions took place mostly\nwhen Supervisor 2 was passing medication. Supervisor 2 was\npresent during the strip search for the missing pencil and reported\nthat while Youth A was in a zoom call for court (would have been\nsearched if they left the facility for in-person court) the pencil was\nfound and the strip search ended. He reported there was no\nindication that Youth A should have been searched for anything\nelse like a medical condition.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with the\nMDHHS Worker on 6/3/2025. He reported not knowing specific\ninformation about Youth A other than Youth A was moved from\ndetention to treatment within the facility. He reported the process if\na youth reports being hurt or in pain is to notify the supervisor or\nNurse. He reported hearing Youth A went to the hospital but had\nno details. He reported no concerns about Nurse and believes she\nis proactive and attends to the youth right away. He reported not\nobserving Youth A with any issues and watched Youth A play\nbasketball and “never sit out a game”. There was never any sign\nof discomfort or issues in the way Youth A walked.\n7",
    "Complainant was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS\nWorker on 6/3/2025. She reported the facility is now sharing\ninformation about Youth A with her. She reported first becoming\naware of Youth A’s pain when Youth A told the lawyer who told\nthe judge, and this occurred a week before the hospital. She\nreported a belief that Youth A wanted to be alone with Nurse and\nno one believed Youth A because of the smiling and joking. She\nreported Youth A didn’t mind if Nurse looked at his privates but\ndidn’t want a male staff to look.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS\nWorker on 6/3/2025. She reported working on 5/14/25 and\nobserving Youth A in the bedroom where Youth A didn’t complain\nof any pain. She reported a half hour later, Nurse reported Youth\nA complained of pain but refused to allow a male staff to assist\nwith the examination of the painful area. She reported Staff 7\nwrote an incident report about observing Youth A engage in\nmasturbation when doing a room check on 5/14/25. She reported\nnever hearing Youth A request to be taken to the hospital and has\na history of faking illness. She reported observing Youth A\nlaughing and joking after 5/14/25 but also noticed Youth A was\nwalking with Youth A’s legs further apart but never telling\nSupervisor 3 he was in pain. She reported Youth A continued to\nplay basketball and engage in different activities, acting normal.\nShe reported because she has no medical knowledge, she was\nfollowing Nurse’s judgement.\nHospital Social Worker was interviewed via phone with the\nMDHHS Worker on 6/10/2025. She reported being told by Youth\nA at the hospital that the injury to Youth A’s testicles occurred\nwhile playing basketball at the facility. She reported Youth A told\nher a male nurse examined Youth A at the facility. She reported\nbeing informed that Youth A refused medical treatment on 5/14/25\nbecause the nurse was female, and it is documented in the\nsurgery note that Youth A has had pain for 2 weeks at the time of\nsurgery.\nSurgery Physician was interviewed via phone with the\nMDHHS Worker on 6/10/2025. She reported being told by Youth\nA the pain has been going on for about a week and Youth A never\ntold anyone about the pain for a “day or two”. Youth A informed\nher that he didn’t want to be examined by Nurse at the facility\nbecause she was female and needed to wait for a male nurse.\nSurgery Physician reported once the blood flow is disrupted, there\nwas only 6 hours before the testicle would be lost, and the pain\ncan be severe. She reported that it is difficult to diagnose the\n8",
    "injury without being able to actually examine Youth A, and unsure\nif an exam could be forced. She reported it is hard to determine\nthe level of injury if Youth A was still playing basketball and hard\nto determine pain tolerance from youth to youth. She reported it\nwould be reasonable to wait a couple of days in the beginning but\nonce a few days had gone by and Youth A sill complained of pain,\nwalked “funny”, and had limited activity, Nurse probably should\nhave reached out to a medical provider. She reported if the right\ntesticle is functioning, Youth A will still be able to father children.\nShe reported the stories from Youth A and others, appear\ninconsistent and it would have been difficult to diagnosis if no\nexamination took place, and he was still engaged in sports like\nbasketball.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS Worker on\n6/13/2025. Staff 4 reported working with Youth A and “about a\nmonth ago”, when having Youth A get up for a phone call, noticing\nYouth A walking “funny”. Youth A was lying on a mattress on the\nfloor of the bedroom when Staff 4 came into the room to get Youth\nA up. Youth A informed Staff 4 that Youth A had “pain down there”\npointing to Youth A’s groin area. Staff 4 reported telling Supervisor\n1 about Youth A stating having pain in the groin area. Staff 4\nreported Youth A was in his room most of the time between May\n14 and May 23, 2025.\nStaff 7 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS Worker on\n6/13/2025. Staff 7 reported working with Youth A on 5/14/25 and\nwhen making room checks noticed Youth A was naked laying on a\nmattress on the floor and masturbating. After doing the visual\ncheck, Staff 7 walked away and later wrote an incident report.\nStaff 7 reported Youth A didn’t appear to be in pain and did not\nmention any thing about pain. Staff 7 reported Youth A was\nwalking normal prior to 5/14/25. Staff 7 reported Youth A was in\nthe room because Youth A was on a modified room program for\nhaving contraband in his room. Three to four days later, Staff 7\nreported not knowing the day (believed it was sometime around\n5/16/25-5/17/25) but Youth A did report having pain sometime\nafter 5/14/25. Therefore, Staff 7 called Nurse. Nurse told Staff 7\nthat Youth A was fine. Staff 7 believed Youth A was in pain\nbecause of the way Youth A was walking and Nurse made it\nsound like Youth A was looking for a way to get out of the facility\nso Staff 7 “went with Nurse because Staff 7 has no medical\ntraining”.\nPhysician 1 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS\nWorker on 6/13/2025. She reported being a physician in the\n9",
    "Emergency Room when Youth A was admitted. She reported\nYouth A said he was hurt about 2 weeks prior to the Emergency\nRoom visit. Physician 1 reported within the first 24-48 hours of a\ntesticle being twisted, the person would be in a lot of pain but once\nthe testicle dies, the pain goes away and there is only discomfort\nfrom the swelling. She reported normally working with individuals\nwhen they are experiencing the pain of the twisting.\nPhysician 2 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS\nWorker on 6/13/2025. Physician 2 reported providing care to\nYouth A when Youth A was brought to the Emergency Room on\n5/23/25. He reported Youth A informed Physician 2 that Youth A\nwas hurt playing basketball 2 weeks prior and feeling pain from\nthe injury. Youth A informed Physician 2 that Youth A waited to\nsee if this became better before going to Nurse but not saying how\nlong Youth A waited (hours or days). Youth A stated Nurse tried\nto examine Youth A, but Youth A refused, and the pain was on\nand off, but Youth A still played basketball.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS Worker on\n6/16/2025. He first noticed Youth A limping on a Friday or\nSaturday but was unable to recall the specific date. He reported\nasking Youth A about the limp and having Youth A respond saying\n“something about his testicles” and Youth A asked Staff 5 to call\nNurse. Staff 5 reported informing Supervisor 3 and Nurse. Staff 5\nreported Youth A asked more than once to see Nurse and each\ntime asking, Staff 5 would contact Nurse and let her know. Staff 5\nreported taking Youth A to the gym and telling Youth A not to play\nbasketball because Youth A appeared to be in pain, but Staff 5\nbelieved Youth A played basketball at times after. Staff 5 reported\nYouth A never told Staff 5 how Youth A injured himself and Staff 5\ndescribed Youth A as a “strong kid” who has played basketball\nwith a hurt ankle in the past. Staff 5 reported Youth A informed\nStaff 5 that a male staff was going to check Youth A’s injury and\nNurse was also going to examine the injury.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nEmail from Nurse dated 6/6/25. Nurse documents as the\npurpose of this email is to add additional information to her\ninterview on 6/3/25. Nurse reported the rule for youth asking for\npain medication changed while she was off work. Nurse reported\nreceiving an email of the policy change because she had been\nasking for assistance with the frequency of passing medication to\nyouth. Nurse reported the new policy involves any youth that asks\nany staff member for Tylenol or Ibuprofen, will be locked in their\n10",
    "room as out of program (OOP) sick until the nurse is notified to\nevaluate/clear that resident. She reported having several youth\nangry with her because of this change and having the youth state\nthey are not asking for pain medication because they don’t want to\nbe in their rooms. Nurse reported a belief that because of this new\npolicy and Youth A serving a 5-day room suspension, Youth A\navoided asking for pain medication because Youth A didn’t want\nto spend more time in his room. Nurse reported reviewing the\nmedication logs and finding that Youth A asked night shift staff for\npain medication on 5/15/25, 5/16/25, and 5/17/25 and the policy of\nOOP Sick was not enforced for Youth A. This caused Nurse not to\nbe notified and Youth A was not evaluated by Nurse. Nurse\nreported other youth who asked for pain medication were placed\non OOP SICK and had to be cleared by her. Nurse reported not\nagreeing with the new policy, but if it stands then it should “be fair\nfor all youth”.\nEmail from PhD dated 6/12/25. PhD reported having no contact\nwith Youth A on 5/14/25 or 5/23/25 and has no concerns\nregarding potential child abuse and/or neglect. PhD reported\nhaving no concerns about the care and safety of all youth in the\nfacility.

This\ndocument outlines what Nurse provided during her interview with\nminimal detail changes. The primary changes is Nurse\ndocumenting her struggles with a belief she is not being supported\nby supervisors and youth specialists. She believes she is\nproviding care, and the supervisors and youth specialists should\nbe able to be supportive by providing to the basic needs of the\n13",
    "youth. Another aspect is Nurse documenting that she found out on\n5/26/25 that Youth A did not receive the strip search.\nNursing updated notes about Youth A:\n2/4/25: -Youth A was complaining of left-hand pain. He stated he\nthought it was broken. His hand is sore from “punching things 2\ndays ago” per Youth A, but it is not broken. He had full range of\nmotion. The minor swelling he has in his left hand should resolve\nwith rest and ibuprofen, possibly ice if it gets to that point. Please\ndo not offer any ACE compression wraps to Youth A. I’m trying to\nbreak him of this habit.\n2/5/25: -Youth A is still required Tylenol for his hand pain every\nfew hours (yet giggling in class). Between his constant requests\nand everyone telling me he’s been extremely grumpy today; it\nappears he may have been off his Lamictal for bipolar disorder. I\ngot it reordered through Arcadia for delivery tomorrow. His PO\nspoke to his mom yesterday and mom is stating she does not\nbelieve his meds were working and that previous juvenile staff\nstated his meds were “keeping him up all night”. They are\nexpecting Med Bus Physician to adjust his meds on the med bus,\nbut Youth A sees an outside provider at Bronson Internal\nMed/Peds for his psych meds. Med Bus Physician may or may not\nmake this adjustment since it is a psych med. I let Probation\nOfficer know.\n2/11/25: -Youth A states his left hand is still painful and he is\nrequesting an x-ray. I advised Med Bus Physician will have to\nassess his hand first on the medical bus before any orders for x-\nray are received. I plan to give Med Bus Physician a heads up as\nYouth A finds an issue with his hand (or leg) at each admission. I\nalso called his mother to verify his allergies. She stated he is\nallergic to NOTHING and sometimes he sees YouTube videos\nregarding “chemicals in food”, but it does not relate to him. Her\nexact words were “my son is a liar.” Smh. Supervisor notified this\nmorning.\n2/12/25: -Youth A is still complaining of hand pain. I gently\ntouched his hand today to assess and he screamed. I saw him\nplaying basketball not too long ago, so it’s really not making any\nsense… I’m just making him NPA until he can get on the med bus\nFriday for further evaluation. He was given ibuprofen. I also let\nHome Detention Worker know who will notify his PO (who is\ncurrently off for the week).\n14",
    "2/21/25: -Youth A’s hand x-ray results came back. Per Med Bus\nPhysician, all results are normal. There is no evidence of fracture.\nI asked Youth A yesterday if his hand still hurt and he said yes.\nHis injury is from 21 days ago, so it really shouldn’t be hurting that\nbad as it’s been almost a month, and the hand is not broken. It is\npossible he could have sprained his hand while punching a wall,\nbut there doesn’t appear to be any swelling or immobility at this\ntime, so it is unlikely. He can be removed from NPA, but I would\nalso like him to try to reduce his ibuprofen use to only a few times\nper week as compared to requesting daily. When I told him the\nhand was not broken, he got angry then asked for Tylenol for a\nheadache. I’m getting the vibe his mom needs to set up an appt\nwith his psychiatrist again for a medication review. I sent a\nmessage to Probation Officer and spoke w/ his mother today to let\nher know. PhD also suspected some autism during their last\nencounter which may explain some of his behaviors.\n4/10/25: -Youth A had a small nosebleed while in class this\nmorning. He completed a couple minutes with the nasal mister in\nmy office, and I put some ointment in his left nostril to moisturize\nhis mucous membranes.\n4/11/25: Youth A had another minor nosebleed today. Staff 12\nstated he saw the blood. Youth A claims “I think my nose only\nbleeds when I’m in school because I don’t want to go.” I told him\nnosebleeds shouldn’t correlate with class times and questioned\nhim about aggravating his nostrils to make them bleed, and he\nstated he wasn’t. He was treated with the nasal mister again today\nand returned to class.\n4/15/25: -Youth A claims he had another nosebleed around 4pm\ntoday that went unwitnessed... I allowed him to use our nasal\nmister once more, but I let him know these bleeds MUST be\nwitnessed to keep using the mister throughout the week. This is\nhis 3rd nosebleed since last week. He verbalized understanding.\n5/1/25: -Youth A stated he’s noticed his behaviors lately have\nbeen worse, and he feels like “being bad” is due to his medication.\nI told him he JUST had a Zoloft increase, so it is more likely\nrelated to other factors, but that I would still call his psych doc. 2nd\ngeneration antipsychotic may be considered if behaviors do not\nimprove per doctor’s previous notes. Awaiting a callback.\n5/2/25: -Youth A’s doctor’s office called back stating they would\nlike him to continue sertraline 100mg for an additional week to\ngive the meds a full chance to kick in. IF his behaviors worsen, I\n15",
    "will have to call back to notify so that he may be dropped back\ndown to the 50mg dose, and a 2nd med will be added. I am not\nwith Youth A all-day so please update in the next week or two if\nyou see or hear something concerning.\n5/13/25: -Youth A was complaining of something being stuck in his\nleft ear. When I looked at the ear canal with a flashlight it\nappeared he had a lot of wax and chunks of debris in there. I\ncould also tell he was scratching because he ripped the skin off\nclose to his ear canal. We cleaned his ears out with a little\nperoxide which helped a lot, and I followed up with triple antibiotic\nointment for his skin. May repeat these steps with Q-Tips as\nneeded. I also reached out to Probation Officer about his hurting\nteeth since he is req a dental appt.\n5/14/25: -Youth A was on the floor in his room complaining of\ntesticular pain. I asked him what the pain felt like, and he stated,\n“like it’s squeezing” and stated both his testicles were “to the side.”\nHe said he probably hit his testicles while sleeping… I have my\ndoubts… I offered him a heat pack and he refused and stated he\npreferred ice. Ice and ibuprofen were given. He is the 2nd C-Pod\nkid in a week to complain of testicular pain. If this becomes a trend\nfor attention, do NOT call me and tell them to stretch. Update: A\nstaff member noted they walked past Youth A’s room and saw him\n“touching himself.” His request to be sent to the hospital will be\ndenied as I explained to him, there is NOTHING an ER will do for\nhim if he has testicular pain after what is perceived to be\nmasturbating. And furthermore, PLEASE have staff be clear when\nthey are announcing chest pain on the radio. As I was checking\nhis vitals Youth A stated he was not having chest pain at all he\nwas having testicular pain…again.\n5/20/25: -Youth A is still “displaying” that he cannot walk properly\nand that his testicles hurt. He felt the need to report his testicular\npain in court today. I let him know AGAIN this morning that he will\nnot be sent to the hospital for this. He’s been giggling all morning,\nso he can’t be hurting that bad. Since his complaint has been\nongoing, he will be on this Friday’s mobile unit for a testicular\nexam by Med Bus Physician. When he saw me in YCS this\nmorning he also suddenly reported a nosebleed. All I saw was one\nsmall drop of blood. He was given a couple mins on the nasal\nmister and sent back to class.\nEmails between Probation Officer and Nurse dated 5/20/25.\nProbation Officer reports Youth A shared with his attorney in court\nthat he has “some serious health concerns that need immediate\n16",
    "attention” Probation Officer documents Youth A is claiming his\ntesticles are twisted. Probation Officer request to know what\naction Nurse is taking to address this concern. Nurse responds by\ndocumenting that Youth A was observed by staff “touching\nhimself” and reporting aching testicles ever since. Nurse states\noffering ibuprofen and a heat pack last week but having Youth A\nrefuse and asking for ice which Nurse provided. Nurse also stated\nYouth A “has been putting on a show all morning wadding and\ngiggling stating he cannot walk”. Youth A is still requesting to be\ntaken to the emergency room. Nurse states she cannot believe\nthis is a medical emergency because of the laughing and giggling\nby Youth A. Nurse states Youth A has given two different stories\nabout the cause of the injury but if the problem persists, Nurse\nindicates Youth A will visit the Med Bus this Friday.\nEmail from Administrator 2 dated 5/28/25. It is documented\nYouth A received room time and was agitated. Youth A stated he\nneeded hand sanitizer, and staff would not allow him in the\nmoment. Youth A told Administrator 2 “ok, you’ll see, I’m about to\nbe over at the hospital again”. Youth A is documented as being\nplaced on “blue alert” until tomorrow when PhD can speak with\nYouth A.\nEmail from PhD dated 5/29/25. It is documented Youth A is\ncleared for standard observation. Youth A reported trying to calm\nhimself with a “dumb” joke and realized this was not a wise\ndecision. Youth A was able to identify appropriate alternatives to\nhelp regulate himself.\nEmail from Staff 2 dated 5/30/25. Staff 2 documents that while in\nthe hospital with Youth A, Youth A reported not initially telling\nanyone of the pain because Youth A thought the pain would go\naway.\nEmail from Licensing Consultant dated 6/18/25. Staff 13 Face\nto face interview (06/17/2025 around 3pm)\nStaff 13 stated the last time he spoke to Youth A was after Youth\nA had surgery on his testicle. Staff 13 stated he was walking\nYouth A back from holding, and asked him what happened. Staff\n13 stated he had not worked when Youth A had surgery. Staff 13\nstated Youth A told him, “I was killing my shit.” Staff 13 was asked\nwhat that meant. Staff 13 stated Youth A was jacking off. Staff 13\nstated Youth A told him he had been “doing all that room time”,\nand he had nothing else to do. Staff 13 stated Youth A said the\nnext morning he woke up and felt that something was off. Staff 13\n17",
    "stated Youth A said he had been walking weird, and he tried to tell\nthe doctor that he got hit with a basketball, but the doctor did not\nbelieve him.\nHR file for Nurse was reviewed. Documentation indicates Nurse\nwas hired on 8/19/2024. There is no documentation of discipline in\nthe file and her nursing license is up to date. Nurse is licensed is\nlicensed as a Registered Nurse with the Board of Nursing State of\nMichigan. The license expires on 6/8/2027.\nKalamazoo County Government Job Description for Nurse II\ndated 4/20/2024. This document outlines the duties and\nresponsibilities for the position of Nurse II. General duties are\nlisted as immunizations, infectious disease testing, administering\nmedications, performing ongoing patient assessments, completes\nreferrals, and maintains documentation.\nWalk-through:\nA walk-through was completed at the facility. The facility is a\nsingle-story building in good repair. The facility is furnished\nappropriately, especially in the bedroom areas.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as evidenced by interviews\nwith staff, youth, and documentation reviewed. Evidence indicates\nNurse delayed medical treatment to Youth A because of a belief\nYouth A was not being truthful about his claim of an injury. Nurse\nappears to have based her belief on observing Youth A playing\nbasketball, laughing, joking, giggling, and having a history of\nmedication seeking behaviors. An additional factor is Youth A’s\nrefusal to be examined when it was offered twice. Nurse sought\nadvice from non-medically trained staff (Administrator 2 and\nAdministrator 3) rather than seeking a second opinion from\nanother medical professionals. She also conducted a “Google”\nsearch for information. This led to a lack of medical care for Youth\nA. It should be noted there is a strong suspicion that Youth A’s lost\nfunction of his testicle occurred because evidence supports Youth\nA did not inform Nurse or other staff within the 6-hour window to\nsave the testicle once it was twisted. Therefore, the lack of\nmedical care did not occur until after the loss of the testicle. Youth\nA gave several possible causes of the injury which seems to\nchange depending on who Youth A is speaking with.\n18",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding the Nurse seeking\nnon-medical advice rather than seeking support and consultation\nfrom another trained medical professional. It was suggested the\nfacility contract with a physician or program that provides\nphysicians that would be available to consult with the Nurse at any\nmoment consultation is needed.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n6/17/25\n______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n07/08/2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n19"
