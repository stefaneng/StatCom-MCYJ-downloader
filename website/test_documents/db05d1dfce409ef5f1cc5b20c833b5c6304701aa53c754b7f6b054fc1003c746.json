Complainant\ndid not provide any more details to this allegation.\nTherapist 1:\nOn 11/25/24, I interviewed Therapist 1 face to face at the facility.\nTherapist 1 reported Youth A was receiving the medications\nprescribed to him by the psychiatrist. Therapist 1 reported Foster\nCare Worker 1 approved the medications by signing the medical\nsheets. Therapist 1 reported the psychiatrist prescribed the\nmedication and the agency filled that medication and administered\nit. Therapist 1 reported she has never heard Youth A complain\nabout his medications. Therapist 1 reported Youth A does not\npresent lethargic but active.\nYouth A:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at St. Clair Treatment\nCenter on 2/6/25. Youth A reported he has never had any issues\nwith his medications.\n2",
    "Documents Reviewed:\n• Intake document recorded Youth A’s admittance on\n6/27/24.\n• Initial Psychiatric Evaluation completed on 7/14/24. Current\nmedications were noted as Vyvanse 70mg, Abilify 10mg,\nOlanzapine 20mg, Trazadone 150mg, Sertraline 150mg.\nRecommendations: Youth A had already started his\nmedications from a previous agency and a medical consent\nform will be obtained for additional medications prescribed.\n• Medication Consent Forms were signed by Worker 1 on\n8/16/24 and Psychiatrist 1 on 7/24/24. The following\nmedications were added: Depakote 250mg, Zyprexa\n2.5mg, Atarax 25mg. There were no other medical consent\nforms.\n• I reviewed the Health Services Policies and Procedures.\no “All medications administered to youth are to be\nordered in writing by agency physicians. Medications\nand prescriptions will be accompanying youth\ntransferring from other institutions will be reviewed\nand verified by an agency physician and\nreordered…”\nAllegation #2:\nThe agency denied giving Youth A his glasses, although he is\nvisually impaired.\nTherapist 1\nOn 11/25/24, I interviewed Therapist 1 at the facility. Therapist 1\nreported Youth A broke an “arm” off his glasses to self-harm.\nBecause of his behaviors, they took the glasses from him.\nTherapist 1 did not know the specific date, but reported they would\nhave given him the glasses back if they knew he could be safe\nwith them.\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 1:\nOn 12/19/24 Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 were interviewed separately\nat the facility. Both reported Youth A broke his glasses and due to\nsafety concerns involving self harm, they were removed from him\nwhen he was on suicide watch.\nYouth A:\nYouth A was interviewed on 2/6/25 face to face at St. Clair\nTreatment Center. Youth A did not want to discuss this topic.\n3",
    "Documents:\n• I reviewed the Use of Safety Precautions for Youth At Risk\npolicy. Items that pose a threat to the youth are to be\nremoved from their physical location.\n• I reviewed the Suicide Precaution Forms. Youth A was\nplaced on suicide precaution multiple times at a Level 3.\n• I reviewed the Emergency Hospital Visit Documents. Youth\nA was observed and stayed extensive nights at the hospital\ndue to the inability to keep himself and others safe. Hospital\nrestraints were completed to keep him from harming\nhimself and others.\nAnalysis Allegation #1: The agency is compliant with this rule. Youth A\ncontinued taking his previously prescribed medications once\nadmitted to Lincoln. After his Initial Psychiatric Evaluation, the\npsychiatrist added medications. These medications were\napproved by Worker 1. Medications were prescribed by the\nattending physician as outlined in the policy.\nAllegation #2: The agency is compliant with this rule. The agency\nfollowed their behavioral health care policy on Use of Safety\nPrecautions for Youth At Risk. Youth A demonstrated unsafe\nbehaviors, which would lead to the agency removing any objects\n(glasses) that could cause harm to Youth A.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents' needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType Additional Rule Violation\nAllegation Allegation #1: Youth A is experiencing unmanaged mental health\nissues.\nAdditional Rule Violation\nAllegation #2: The agency did not follow their suicide precaution\npolicy.\n4",
    "Investigation\nTherapist 1:\nI interviewed Therapist 1 on 11/25/24 and 1/16/25. Therapist 1\nreported she completes individual therapy sessions once a week\nwith Youth A. Therapist 1 reported Youth A has significant trauma\nhistory, and his mental health can be unstable. Therapist 1\nreported Youth A has spent time on suicide watch. When Youth A\nwas on suicide watch and behind a locked bedroom door, she did\nnot enter to provide therapy sessions, but did check on him.\nTherapist 1 reported only a supervisor, or manager could open the\ndoor when a youth entered suicide watch in their room. Therapist\n1 reported she would not have felt safe completing the therapy\nsession with the door open. Therapist 1 reported it was unsafe for\nher to open the door to talk to Youth A, due to possible physical\naggression. Therapist 1 reported she thought it was okay to do\ncheck ins. Therapist 1 reported a “check in” was standing outside\nof the locked bedroom door and asking Youth A how he was doing\nin his room, what he could be working on while waiting for the\npsychiatrist to evaluate him and redirecting him to his behaviors\nthat placed him in the suicide watch room.\nA follow up interview was conducted on 2/13/25 via telephone.\nTherapist 1 reported there was only one therapy session\nscheduled with Youth A’s family. Therapist 1 reported she was\ngiven permission by the Foster Care Worker 1 to have family\ninvolved. Therapist 1 reported she did not case note this\ninteraction with Foster Care Worker 1 and did not know the exact\ndate this was stated. Therapist 1 reported group sessions did not\nhave a structured topic schedule. The topics were based on what\nwas occurring at that time with the unit. At times, they discussed\nhealthy boundaries, following directions, peer relationships in the\ngroup, and communication. Therapist 1 reported her written case\nnotes did not address all the topics they discussed and at times\nthe weekly case notes pertaining to group topics were not updated\nwell. Therapist 1 did review some case notes with this consultant\nand was able to verbalize that some of the case notes started to\nbe generic in nature and there were some that were not updated\nfrom week to week. Therapist 1 did acknowledge that the case\nnoting could be more specific outlining the services and topics the\nagency was providing. Therapist 1 reported psychoeducation\npertaining to victimization and STD’s did not occur because Youth\nA was not at the level he needed to be to engage in this area.\nTherapist 1 reported Youth A was not willing to engage in\ntreatment.\n5",
    "Youth C, Youth D, and Youth E were interviewed separately on\n11/25/24 at the facility. All reported Youth A was \"always”\" on\nsuicide watch in his room.\nYouth A:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at St. Clair Treatment\nCenter on 2/6/25. Youth A would not provide any details\nconcerning his therapy or treatment at Lincoln Center. Youth A\nreported he was tired and did not want to talk anymore.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth A’s Updated Treatment Plan dated 7/27/24-\n10/25/24 outlines the following services to be provided:\n“Individual therapy each week and group therapy at least\nfive times weekly.

Youth A\nwas at the hospital on the following dates: 10/1-10/2, 10/4-\n14, 10/22-10/24.\n• I reviewed Youth A’s MAR’s documents. Medication was\ngiven/offered as prescribed.\nAllegation #2: The agency did not follow their suicide precaution\npolicy.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the Use of Safety Precautions for Youth At Risk\npolicy.\no Level 3: continuous supervision, restriction of the\nyouth’s ability to participate in a group setting, a\nrestriction of the items the youth may have access\nto, and any other interventions deemed clinically\nnecessary to maintain the youth’s safety…\no Moving youth under evaluation to an assigned\nroom…\no Youth on Level 3…may be removed from their\nrooms for hygiene and recreation to the extent that it\n8",
    "can be done safely. When a youth is on Level 3\nprecautions is to be let out of their room, staff will\nnotify a co-worker and the safety support coordinator\nprior to allowing the youth to leave their room…\no In cases where the youth is placed under safety\nprecautions after being placed into seclusion, the\nconsulting psychiatrist shall ensure that staff has\ncompleted processing of the behavior leading to\nseclusion. The youth should be calm and no longer\nrequire the use of the seclusion room prior to\nauthorizing the removal of safety precautions.\no The consulting psychiatrist shall evaluate the youth\nconsidered to be at risk for suicide…an coordinate\nany changes with the facility manager.\no The following documents are to be completed under\nthis policy:\n▪ Unusual Incident Report\n▪ Safety Precaution Initial Level Form\n▪ Safety Precautions Level Change Form\n• I reviewed the following Unusual Incident Reports noting\nYouth A placed on Suicide Precaution:\no 7/9/24: Initial Level Form was missing.\no 7/24/24: Level Change form was missing.\no 8/5/24: Initial and Level Change forms were missing.\no 10/1/24: Initial and Level Change form missing.\no 10/19/24: Initial and Level Change form missing.\n• I reviewed Therapist 1 Case notes. They document Youth\nA in suicide precaution from 7/14/24-7/20/24, some dates\nfrom 8/18/24-8/24/24 (specific dates not noted, only the\ntimeframe,) some dates from 8/25/24-8/31/24 (specific\ndates not noted, only the timeframe), some dates\nfrom7/14/24-7/20/24, some dates from 8/18/24-8/24/24\n(specific dates not noted, only the timeframe,) some dates\nfrom 8/25/24-8/31/24 (specific dates not noted, only the\ntimeframe), some dates from 9/1/24-9/7/24, (Specific dates\nnot noted, only timeframe). There were no documents for\nsuicide precaution completed on those dates.\nAnalysis Allegation #1: The agency is in violation of this rule. The program\nstatement outlines specific aspects of the agency’s program that is\nto be integrated into the care and treatment of the youth. Youth A\nwas not receiving all of the treatment outlined in the program\nstatement.\n• Youth A did not receive individual therapy on 8/16/24,\n9/20/24, 10/11/24, and 10/25/24.\n9",
    "• Documentation is inconsistent with services. Case notes\nwritten by Therapist 1 reported Youth A participated in\nanger management groups, yet Youth A was in suicide\nprecaution (isolation in his room) during those times.\nDuring the dates 8/18/24-9/7/24, case notes state Youth A\nwas in suicide precautions and was not involved in anger\nmanagement groups, yet there are no suicide precaution\ndocumentation for those dates. From 9/8/24-10/5/24 case\nnotes do not state whether Youth A was in attendance at\nthese anger management groups or what his participation\nwas.\n• Family Therapy is only noted as offered once, although it is\nto be offered monthly. There is no documentation to\nsupport monthly therapy or offering of family therapy.\nTherapist 1 reported the only scheduled family session was\ncancelled due to Youth A’s hospitalization.\nThe agency is found in compliance pertaining to these areas of\ntreatment.\n• Substance Abuse, psychoeducation services pertaining to\nrelationships, victimization, or STD groups are not\ndocumented, but interview with Therapist 1 confirms Youth\nA was not ready to engage in these groups as of yet.\n• Youth A was receiving psychiatric services as noted by\nevaluations and hospital visits.\n• Youth A was receiving medical services as outlined by the\nnumerous hospital visits and MAR’s documents.\nTECHNIAL ASSISTANCE:\nDocumentation in the treatment plans did not provide updates\npertaining to the actual services that were being provided by the\nagency (action steps) and the response (actions steps) of Youth\nA. It was noted by Therapist 1 that the action steps in the report\nare not individual based but all youth in the program have the\nsame action steps. Treatment plans are to be client centered.\nYouth A’s report had multiple goals within the same time frame to\ncomplete. The agency has stages to treatment (Stage 1, Stage 2,\nStage 3.) and the actions step time frames should coincide with\nthose stages on paper. Not all goals can be worked on at the\nsame time. Some goals can be postponed in the treatment plan,\ntherefore having different time frames of being initiated and\ncompleted. If action steps are not completed within the time frame\nnoted in the previous reports, then the following treatment plan\nshould explain why those actions steps were not completed. The\nprogram statement outlines the services that are being provided to\n10",
    "all youth. Those services should be discussed within the treatment\nplans.\nDocumentation in the case notes should be client centered and\nspecific to the youth receiving the services. The case notes should\nsupport the plans in the treatment plan. The agency would benefit\nfrom report writing training and case note training as well as a\ntraining showing the thread of services stemming from the\nprogram statement intertwined with documentation.\nConsultation:\nIf clinical reviews are not being completed at the agency it would\nbenefit the agency to begin reviews where the treatment plans,\nservices provided, case notes and progress of a youth are\nobserved, reviewed, discussed, and assessed. This can be used\nas a training tool for those who are writing reports and managing\nthe unit.\nAllegation #2:\nThe agency is in violation of this rule. The agency is missing\ndocumentation for 7/9/24, 7/24/24, 8/5/24, 10/1/24, and 10/19/24.\nTherapist 1’s case notes document more occurrences of suicide\nprecaution. Those dates, if accurate, are missing all\ndocumentation.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe suicide precaution policy is not in align with Licensing Rules\nfor Child Caring Institutions. Seclusion is not noted as something\nthat is to be done for suicide precaution, although the agency\npolicy does state the agency can do “any other interventions\ndeemed clinically necessary to maintain the youth’s safety…” This\nis vague and does not supersede the licensing rules. The\nagency’s current policy waits for the psychiatrist to assess the\nyouth before being moved off of suicide precaution. This may take\ndays and in the meantime the youth is isolated and not involved in\nprogramming. Goals are not formally established or a treatment\nplan, other than placing the child in the room. The agency will\nneed to rewrite their suicide precaution assessments to align with\nlicensing rules.\nCONSULTATION:\nThe policy should be trauma informed and should not decrease\nservices provided to the youth but intensify them. Specific goals\nand interventions should be in place to help the youth, as well as\nassessments of those goals. Therapist, facility managers, and\nstaff should all know the interventions and goals being worked on\n11",

All staff and youth\ninterviewed reported that staff always intervened when youth\nbecame aggressive.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Seclusion within secure and nonsecure facilities; seclusion\nTitle plan; prohibitions; reduction and elimination\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4162\nSection (11) All seclusions will be prohibited effective November 1. 2022.\nDescription\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Th facility placed Youth A into seclusion as punishment and kept\nhim in seclusion for days.\nInvestigation On 11/25/24 the following interviews were completed face to face\nat the facility.\nAdministrator 2:\nAdministrator 2 reported Youth A was not in seclusion but was on\nsuicide watch.

Therapist 1 reported when he was placed on suicide\nwatch he would be placed into his room. The door was locked,\nand a staff member would be at his door.

Therapist 1 reported he would wait in his room until the\npsychiatrist would come to the site and meet with him.\nSupervisor 1:\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A was placed on suicide watch often.\nShe reported Youth A was aggressive as well. Supervisor 1\nreported when a youth was placed on suicide watch and was\nassessed as a “level 3” they would be placed into their room with\nthe door locked. Supervisor 1 reported a level 3 was aggressive;\ntherefore, they had to be in their room. Supervisor 1 reported they\nwould have a staff at their door and the youth would not be\nallowed to leave suicide watch until the psychiatrist released them\nfrom suicide watch. Supervisor 1 reported the facility supervisor,\nor manager could open the door for phone calls, clinical services,\nand other needs while on suicide watch. Supervisor 1 reported\nthat even if the youth were no longer threatening or aggressive\nwhile in the room, they needed to wait for the psychiatrist to\nassess him to allow him out of the room.

    "Staff 2 reported it could take two-three days before the psychiatrist\ncame to the facility to assess him.\nYouth A\nYouth A was interviewed on 2/6/25 face to face at St. Clair\nTreatment Center. Youth A reported he was placed in his room\noften. Youth A reported staff would lock the door and he would be\nunable to come out of his room. Youth A reported he sometimes\nwould be in his room for a week or two. Youth A reported he did\ncome out for showers. Youth A did not provide any more\ninformation pertaining to being in his room.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the agency’s Seclusion Room and Reintegration\nPolicy.\n• The agency did not have seclusion documents for Youth A,\nbut did have Suicide Precaution Forms or Incident reports\nthat placed Youth A in his room on the following dates:\n7/9/24-7/10/24, 7/15/24-7/17/24, 7/24/24-7/26/24, 8/5/24-no\nend date documentation, 8/13/24-8/15/24, 10/1/24-no end\ndate documentation, 10/4/24-no end date documentation.\n• Therapist 1 Case notes document Youth A in suicide\nprecaution form 7/14/24-7/20/24, some dates from 8/18/24-\n8/24/24 (specific dates not noted, only the timeframe,)\nsome dates from 8/25/24-8/31/24 (specific dates not noted,\nonly the timeframe), some dates from 9/1/24-9/7/24,\n(Specific dates not noted, only timeframe).\n• Lincoln currently has a variance approval for R.400.4162\n(11). The last approved variance was completed on\n1/31/25. The variance is not approved to be used for a\nyouth on “suicide watch.”\nAnalysis The agency is in violation of this rule. Seclusion, as defined by\nLicensing Rules for Child Caring Institutions is the involuntary\nplacement of a youth in a room alone, where the youth is\nprevented from exiting by any means, including the physical\npresence of staff person if that staff person’s presence prevents\nthe youth from exiting the room. The agency placed Youth A\nmultiple times in his room. The door was locked, and Youth A was\nunable to leave the room. In this situation, seclusion could only be\nused as a temporary response to behavior that threatens\nimmediate harm to a youth and then the youth would be removed\nfrom seclusion. The agency has a variance in effect to use\nseclusion and they did not follow the guidelines noted in the\nvariance.\n17",
    "Conclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and an acceptable corrective action plan is required.\n2/18/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
