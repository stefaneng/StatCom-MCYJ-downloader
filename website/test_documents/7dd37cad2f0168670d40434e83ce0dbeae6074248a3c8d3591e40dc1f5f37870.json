DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules except for\nthe following:\nCPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n• (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or\nparents and the foster parents in the\ndevelopment of service plans to enable the\nparent or parents and foster parents to\nunderstand the plan for the child and the\nparents' and the foster parent's role in assisting\nthe agency in carrying out the plan. An agency\nshall give a copy to and review the parent-\nagency treatment plan with the parent or parents\nand foster parents. The agency must inform the\nparent or parents and foster parent that the\ninformation in the parent-agency treatment plan\nand any other information about the child and\nthe child's family is confidential.\nOne out of three files reviewed contained a PATP that documented late foster\nparent signatures.",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following area:\n• Technical assistance was provided regarding R 400.12417, Foster Parent\nInformation. In one file the DHS-3307 was not completed however a social\nwork contact dated 6-11-2024 documented that the foster care worker\nreviewed and provided the information required by the rule to the foster\nparent on the day of placement. There was some vagueness in the contact\nregarding the worker thoroughly covering sub-rule (d) and (g).\nRecommended that the agency utilize the DHS-3307 consistently for all\ncases.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Consultation was not requested or required at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the CAP is as follows: The agency\nsubmitted an approved corrective action plan on 7-3-2024 in response to a policy\nviolation established during the 6-7-2024 Interim Inspection. There was not a\nrepeat violation as the department is no longer auditing DHHS policy.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrators Assessment was thorough and well written. The\nProgram Manger conducts an internal quality review, and the review is thorough\nand documented. Barriers were discussed and noted that multiple high needs\nyouth in residential can demand much time that can pull focus away from other\ncases. The anticipated merger of Benzie/Manistee counties with Mason County\nhas resulted in workers concerns about future work status as well as additional\nworkloads. The assessment also noted that additional travel time has occurred as\nworkers will have to travel into Mason County.\nThe assessment further addressed the rule violation from the 2024 Interim\nInspection and the agencies efforts to prevent future violations.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency is a local DHHS office and therefore financial records were not\navailable.",
    "Staff Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported enjoying working for the agency. Staff reported that they\nfeel supported by their supervisor and there is a strong supportive foster care\nteam at the agency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has two offices, one in Manistee and one in Beulah. The Manistee\noffice was my first visit there and is a new location for the agency from the\nprevious office which was also located in Manistee. The agency has sufficient\noffice space. CHRI documents are stored at the Beulah office location and were\nobserved to be secured appropriately.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe CPA Analyst did not find any safety concerns during her visits to the homes.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJune 20, 2025\n_____________________________________\nDouglas Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 25, 2025\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
