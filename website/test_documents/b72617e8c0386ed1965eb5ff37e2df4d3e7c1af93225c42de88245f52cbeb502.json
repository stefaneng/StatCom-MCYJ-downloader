    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this\nrule:\n(e) Three dated references which are obtained prior to\nemployment from persons unrelated to the employee and which\nare less than 12 months old.\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of human\nservices, the equivalent state or Canadian provincial agency, or\nequivalent agency in the country where the person usually\nresides, that the person has not been determined to be a\nperpetrator of child abuse or child neglect. The documentation\nshall be completed not more than 30 days prior to the start of\nemployment and every 12 months thereafter.\n(e) One of 13 new employee files reviewed contained references that were dated\nafter the employee was hired.\n(i) Two of 13 new employee files reviewed contained central registry clearances for\nchild abuse/neglect that were not completed according to the rule. One was\ncompleted after the employee’s hire. The other contained a clearance dated more\nthan 30 days prior to hire and a second clearance completed after hire.\nR 400.4154 Shelter care and detention institutions; service plans.\n(1) Within 30 calendar days after admission and every 15\ncalendar days thereafter, an institution shall complete a written\nservice plan. The service plan shall include all of the following:\n(a) The reason for continued care.\n(b) Evaluation of service needs.\n(c) Ongoing service needs.\n(d) How service needs will be met.\n(e) Unmet service needs and the reasons those needs are\nunmet.\n4",
    "Two of two short term detention files reviewed contained 30-day service plans that\nwere completed late. The facility used the date after the 7-day plan was completed\nand not the admission date as noted in the rule.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility does not take DHHS youth, so MISEP is not applicable.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHHS Contract/Policy violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included\nin section 1.\nThe facility is not contracted with DHHS; therefore, no contract or policy requirements\napply.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR 154(1)(b)\nThe facility was advised to ensure they are not copying and pasting information from\none detention service plan to the next. Each is to be a review of the period and\nupdated accordingly.\nR 166\nThe facility was advised to ensure they include all services provided, on the open\ntreatment unit discharge summaries, and not limit that to medical and dental.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nR 113\nThe facility is asked to provide some organization to the employee files so that\ninformation is separated into sections. At this time, all documents are in one open file\nso the entire file must be reviewed to find each necessary requirement during an\ninspection.\n5",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care or substantiated\ncorporal punishment during this licensing period.\nThe facility has not been required to submit any corrective action plans this licensing\nperiod.\nThere have been no special investigations during this period. The facility has\ndemonstrated efforts to comply with the new restraint rules by reporting the one\nrestraint they have done. It appears they are making efforts to comply with licensing\nrules.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nMarch 11, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 15, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
