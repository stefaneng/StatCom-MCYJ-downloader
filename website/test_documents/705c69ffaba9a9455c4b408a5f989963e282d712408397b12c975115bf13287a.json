Payment was unauthorized by the State until\n5/16/17 (three months).\n7",
    "This answer was not satisfactory by the consultant. The agency will submit a corrective\naction plan due to a violation of their contract. PAFC 19 – 50001 Placing Agency Foster\nCare states when the contractors’ financial records reveal that payment for a child has\nnot been provided by MDHHS within 30 days of receiving all necessary documentation,\nthe contractor will seek payment resolution by contacting the direct supervisor of the\nassigned MDHHS worker in writing. Any concerns over a payment authorization or\nissuance that cannot be resolved within 30 days of the written notice must be reported\nto the MDHHS County Director for immediate resolution.

The caregiver after many set\ndeadlines, meetings and other follow-ups submitted her adoption application on\n2/17/2018. The application was incomplete. Follow up was required in order to obtain\ninformation regarding references. The adoption was delayed one year by the caregiver.\nThere are court reports, adoption quarterlies, child assessment addendum that has\naddressed these barriers to adoption. A deadline letter dated March 8, 2018 was sent\nto the caregiver.\nThere were three unannounced visit attempts made. Dates were April 30, 2018, July\n17, 2018, and September 12, 2018. For all attempts no one was home or no one\nanswered the door. The foster care specialist recorded these attempts in MiSACWIS.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that Homes for Black Children\ncontinue on a regular license.\n03/21/2019\n________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 22, 2019\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n9"
