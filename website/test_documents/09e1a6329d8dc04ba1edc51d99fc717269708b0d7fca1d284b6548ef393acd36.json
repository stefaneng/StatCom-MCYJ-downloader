    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• There was no technical assistance requested or required.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• There was no consultation requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency Renewal inspection was completed on 3/16/23 and the CAP was\napproved on 4/11/23. The agency was cited for 7 violations, 7 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 7, there was an improvement in individual incidents of\nnon-compliance within 4 of the violation areas (foster parent information, visitation\nand parenting time, FTM documentation and medical passports) and a slight\nincrease in number of individual incidents in the other 3 areas (supervisor\napproval, PATP's, and FTM's). In 2022, 16 violations were established, 5 of which\nwere repeated this year. All of the repeated violations remain close to the number\nof individual incidents of non-compliances except for an increase in FTM's and\nPATP's and a decrease in medical passports. The agency will need to establish\nadditional corrective planning for the repeated violations to ensure a reduction of\nincidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated the CAP that is in place has been effective. However, they have had a\nlot of difficult cases with multiple placement changes, and they assisted another\noffice and inherited challenging cases from them as well. In addition, there have\nbeen some staff that went out on leave which also impacted overall compliance.\nThe chief administrator reported the agency has worked diligently to provide\nsupports to placements, caregivers, youth and parents as well as their staff.\n9",
    "Financial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisors are available to assist as needed, however\nthere is room for improvement among the staff.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. Records are stored securely.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n______5/14/2024___________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n05/15/2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n10"
