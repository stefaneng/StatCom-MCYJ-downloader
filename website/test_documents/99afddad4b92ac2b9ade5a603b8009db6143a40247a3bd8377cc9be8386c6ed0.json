INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12417 Foster Parent Information.\nSection (1) An agency shall provide a foster parent with all of the following\nDescription information before the placement or replacement of a child:\n1",
    "(d) Any known history of abuse or neglect of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster parent not informed of all child's history of abuse.\nInvestigation I interviewed Complainant 1 by telephone on 2/2/2023.\nComplainant 1 stated Foster Parent 1 reported that Foster Parent\n1 was not informed of the human trafficking history experienced by\nYouth A prior to Youth A's placement in Foster Parent 1's home.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 by telephone on 2/2/2023 and\nscheduled a virtual interview for 2/06/2023. I completed a virtual\ninterview 2/06/2023 involving Administrator 1, Foster Care\nSupervisor 1, Foster Care Worker 1, Administrator 2, and Analyst\n1. They reported Youth A was placed with Foster Parent 1 after\nYouth A was picked up from being AWOL from Youth A's\nresidential treatment program for human trafficking youth. They\nreported discussing Youth A's issues with Foster Parent 1 at the\ntime Youth A was placed with Foster Parent 1. They stated they\nthought Foster Parent 1 worked well with Youth A and stated they\nhad no complaints regarding Foster Parent 1's attempts to help\nYouth A. They indicated Foster Parent 1 went above and beyond\nin attempting to provide an appropriate placement to meet the\nneeds of Youth A. An example provided was that Foster Parent 1\nwas willing to take Youth A back for a temporary placement\nfollowing Youth A's truancy from the home of Foster Parent 1.\nThe agency staff indicated they thought Foster Parent 1 was\ninformed of the human trafficking history of Youth A since the\nresidential program Youth A was truant from specialized in human\ntrafficking victims and a special rate of reimbursement was\ndeveloped for Foster Parent 1 due the unique needs of Youth A.\nI interviewed Foster Parent 1 by telephone on 2/28/2023. Foster\nParent 1 stated she was informed Youth A had been truant from a\nresidential placement but was not aware the program specialized\nin human trafficking victims. Foster Parent 1 stated she was\ninformed Youth A had been sexually assaulted but was unaware\nof the human trafficking history. Foster Parent 1 stated she was\ninformed Youth A experienced two broken adoptions but was\nunaware of the human trafficking.\nThe information record for Youth A was reviewed. The\ninformation documented indicated a number of other entities were\ninformed regarding the human trafficking history when the agency\n2",
    "was attempting to locate an appropriate placement for Youth A.\nHowever, Foster Parent 1 was not included in these\ncommunications. Subsequent contacts with Foster Parent 1 also\ndid not indicate Foster Parent 1 was informed prior to the\nplacement of Youth A in the home of Foster Parent 1.\nAnalysis The record indicates there was a great deal of communication\nbetween agency staff and Foster Parent 1 regarding Youth A.\nThe record indicates Youth A is a very difficult case reflecting the\nhistory and behaviors of Youth A. The documentation provided in\nthe record is insufficient to determine Foster Parent 1 was\ninformed of the human trafficking history of Youth A prior to Youth\nA being placed in the home of Foster Parent 1.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12417 Foster Parent Information.\nSection (1) An agency shall provide a foster parent with all of the following\nDescription information before the placement or replacement of a child:\n(h) Any other known information to enable the foster parent to\nprovide a stable, safe, and healthy environment for the foster child\nand the foster family, including information about siblings who do\nnot reside in the foster home.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Parent not informed of youth's human trafficking history.\nInvestigation Refer to content from part (d) of same rule noted above. All\ncontent applies to this section of the rule as well.\nAnalysis The record indicates there was a great deal of communication\nbetween agency staff and Foster Parent 1 regarding Youth A. The\nrecord indicates Youth A is a very difficult case reflecting the\nhistory and behaviors of Youth A. The documentation provided in\nthe record is insufficient to determine Foster Parent 1 was\ninformed of the human trafficking history of Youth A prior to Youth\nA being placed in the home of Foster Parent 1.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection (1) An agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nDescription parenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the following:\n3",
    "(b) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster child\nand the foster parent in the foster parent’s home at least once\nevery month.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Social Worker did not complete the required foster home visits.\nwith the youth.\nInvestigation I interviewed Administrator 1 by telephone on 2/2/2023 and\ncompleted a virtual interview with Administrator 1, Administrator 2,\nFoster Care Supervisor 1, Foster Care Worker 1, and Analyst 1 on\n2/06/2023. They reported that face to face contact at the foster\nhome with Youth A had been completed as required by this rule.\nI interviewed Foster Parent 1 by telephone on 2/28/2023. Foster\nParent 1 stated the foster care worker had visited the foster home\nthree different times while Youth A was in the home of Foster\nParent 1.\nI reviewed the foster care record for Youth A. The record\nindicated Youth A was placed in the home of Foster Parent 1 from\n10/21/2022 to 11/23/2022 and 12/29/2022 to 1/03/2023. The\nsocial work contacts documented face to face contact with Youth\nA at the placement location of Youth A by the worker on\n10/21/2022, 10/24/2022, 11/23/2022, 12/12/2022, 12/19/2022,\n1/09/2023, and 1/31/2023. Youth A was not in the specific foster\nhome during some dates identified, but the dates\nindicate/substantiate Youth A was visited in their placement\nlocation as required by the rule.\nAnalysis Foster Parent 1 stated the worker did visit the foster home three\ndifferent times when Youth A was placed in this home. The record\nfor Youth A indicated the worker did have face to face contact with\nYouth A at Youth A's placement location at least monthly as\nrequired by this rule.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
