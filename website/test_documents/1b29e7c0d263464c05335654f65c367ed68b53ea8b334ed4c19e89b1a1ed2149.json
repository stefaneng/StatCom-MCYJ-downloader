    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Development of service plans\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418\nSection (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents and the\nDescription foster parents in the development of service plans to enable the\nparent or parents and foster parents to understand the plan for the\nchild and the parents' and the foster parent's role in assisting the\nagency in carrying out the plan. An agency shall give a copy to\nand review the parent-agency treatment plan with the parent or\nparents and foster parents. The agency must inform the parent or\nparents and foster parent that the information in the parent-agency\ntreatment plan and any other information about the child and the\nchild's family is confidential.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster care worker has not assisted parent with reunification.\nInvestigation Complainant was contacted by email on 5/6/24 and did not have\nany additional information to provide.\nChief Administrator was interviewed by phone on 5/8/24. Chief\nAdministrator reported the foster care case was moving toward\ntermination. The case had been open for about two years and\nrecently had new allegations under investigation by DHHS. Due to\nthe new allegations, court suspended unsupervised parenting time\nand ordered that parenting time occur supervised at the agency.\nChief Administrator was not aware of any complaints or concerns\nfrom the parents regarding their caseworker or a lack of support.\nChief Administrator had not received any grievances from either\nparent.\nParent 1 was interviewed by phone on 5/8/24. Parent 1 stated she\nfelt her worker was not being helpful with reunification and the\ncourt recently set a date for a termination hearing. Parent 1\nreported she did everything that was asked of her, but Worker 1\nonly focuses on termination, not reunification. Parent 1 expressed\nfrustration about parenting time moving from unsupervised to\nsupervised. However, she understood there was an open\ninvestigation and the court order needed to be followed. Parent 1\nreported that Parent 2 never had unsupervised visits, and believed\nthe agency did not like Parent 2. Parent 1 stated there was an\nincident where Parent 2 was frustrated and yelled at agency staff\n2",
    "in court. Parent 1 felt the agency did not work well with Parent 2\nafter that. Parent 1 provided contact information for Parent 2.\nParent 1 stated she wanted a better worker. Earlier in the case,\nthere was a “better” worker assigned, but she left the agency.\nAfter that, Worker 2 was assigned for about a year. During that\ntime, Worker 2 and Parent 2 had disagreements. Parent 1 did not\nprovide additional detail but stated Parent 2 may want to discuss\nit. Parent 1 noted that Worker 1 was assigned to their case in\nOctober 2023. Parent 1 stated that she did not feel Worker 2\nshould be involved in their case any longer. However, she\nbelieved Worker 1 and Worker 2 discuss their case together.\nOverall, Parent 1 felt that Worker 1 did not do enough to help her.\nWhen asked what she felt Worker 1 should be doing differently,\nParent 1 indicated she felt Worker 1 should focus on returning the\nchildren, not terminating rights. Parent 1 could not identify any\nservices or referrals that were needed from Worker 1. Parent 1\nstated she also felt that Supervisor 1 was “out to get them”. Parent\n1 was asked what specifically Supervisor 1 did or said that made\nher feel that way. Parent 1 said she did not know and did not have\nany examples to provide. Although, Parent 1 recalled asking\nSupervisor 1 for a new case worker and did not receive a\nresponse.\nWorker 1 was interviewed by video conference on 5/10/24.\nWorker 1 reported she was assigned to the case in October 2023.\nThe kids had a few unsupervised, overnight visits with Parent 1.\nHowever, there were two allegations reported to DHHS during\nthose visits. The DHHS investigations have impacted the\nreunification process. In January 2024 there was a goal change to\nadoption. Worker 1 noted she encouraged the parents to\nparticipate in services, leading up to the next court hearing in June\n2024. The services the parents were referred to included\nparenting classes, individual counseling, domestic violence\ncounseling, and couples counseling. Worker 1 stated Parent 1 had\ncompleted four parenting classes previously. However, it was\ndifficult to show she had benefited from the classes when there\nwere two DHHS allegations during unsupervised parenting time.\nWorker 1 reported Parent 2 had started counseling but had not\ncompleted any other services. Worker 1 verified that parenting\ntime had changed due to the recent allegations under\ninvestigation. Worker 1 could not recall requests by either parent\nfor services that were not already in place.\nSupervisor 1 was scheduled for a video conference interview on\n5/10/24. However, the supervisor was a no-show. On 5/23/24,\n3",
    "Supervisor 1 ended their employment with the agency, without\nresponding to emailed questions from DCWL.\nProgram Manager was interviewed by video conference on\n5/10/24. Program Manager verified there is a current DHHS\ninvestigation open regarding Parent 1 & 2, which is why parenting\ntime was moved to supervised. Program Manager stated that\ntermination has been a possibility for a while, due to a lack of\nprogress with the parents and the length of time the case has\nbeen open. Program Manager reported she had never received a\ngrievance or complaint from either parent about Worker 1.\nWorker 2 was interviewed by phone on 5/24/24. Worker 2\nreported she was the case worker for a year and a half. The\nchildren were originally returned home to Parent 1 in October\n2022, but reentered care due to allegations reported to DHHS.\nAbout two months later, Parent 2 was doing very well with their\ntreatment plan and a plan was made to move to unsupervised\nvisits. However, Parent 2 became angry during a court hearing\nand made threats toward Worker 2. Since that time, Parent 2\nrefused to participate in counseling or services to address his\nanger issues, or domestic violence. In addition to needing\ncounseling, Parent 2 also needed stable housing. Despite these\nneeds, Worker 2 reported progress as Parent 2 completed some\nparenting classes and had improved his parenting skills.\nRegarding Parent 1, parenting classes have been completed.\nAlong with participation in counseling and completion of a home\nassessment. However, there are still safety concerns regarding\nreunification. Including the open DHHS investigation and both\nparent’s refusal to comply with drug screens.\nWhen asked about Parent 1’s concern about Worker 2 still being\ninvolved in the case while not assigned, Worker 2 explained that\nshe has been subpoenaed for the termination hearing in June.\nTherefore, Worker 2 has kept up to date with information, but has\nnot been actively involved in the case management.\nParent 2 was interviewed by phone on 5/31/24. Parent 2\nexpressed frustration with the agency, stating they make\nprofessional decisions based on personal feelings and not case\nfacts. Parent 2 reported he and Worker 2 had problems in the\npast. Parent 2 felt that due to Worker 1 training under Worker 2,\nshe was bias to their case from the beginning. Parent 2 reported\nhe felt both caseworkers focused on the wrong information in\ncourt and the judge did not listen to the positive things the parents\nhad done. When asked if Parent 2 had spoken with his attorney\n4",
    "about these concerns and provided them with information to\npresent in court, Parent 2 stated his attorney had not been helpful.\nParent 2 reported there were no referrals or services needed from\nthe agency at this time. Parent 2 stated he had completed all of\nthe services, including parenting classes and counseling. Parent\n2’s frustration was overall due to feeling the agency was bias and\ndid not want to return the children, despite the parent’s attempts to\ncomplete services. Parent 2 stated throughout the case, he felt\nthat reunification was within reach, but then a new investigation\nwould occur with DHHS, causing another delay. This occurred\nthree times. Parent 2 reported he wanted a new case worker that\nwould not be bias. Parent 2 was recently informed by the agency\nthat a new worker has been assigned.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Service plans and Parent/Agency Treatment plans were\nreviewed. The documentation supported the information\nprovided by Worker 1 & Worker 2 regarding progress with\nservices for Parent 1 & Parent 2.\n• Per MiSACWIS, a DHHS investigation was opened on\n4/19/24 regarding Parent 1 and Parent 2.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as Parent 1 and Parent 2 did\nnot identify any specific actions they felt the agency failed to\ncomplete to support reunification. Through a review of the case\nfile, it appeared the agency provided services as required and\nkept the parents informed of necessary treatment plan information\nand referrals.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n_ ______________May 31, 2024_______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 3, 2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n6"
