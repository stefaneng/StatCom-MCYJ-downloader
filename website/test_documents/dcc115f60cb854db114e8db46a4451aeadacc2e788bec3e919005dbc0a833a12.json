Youth A said staff are supposed to\nwatch youth closely and do more “checks” on them when they are\non constant supervision.

Youth F said there have not\nbeen extra staff added to work with the youth however the staff\nworking will often have to call extra staff to come into work\nbecause of the chaos in the facility.

Staff 1 denied any\nadditional staff being added to the schedule to assist with the\nincreased concerns in the house. Staff 1 said she has talked to\nVice President of Program Development regarding her concerns\nwith Youth E and was told that “he does not care” and that there\nwould be another youth with similar behaviors placed so they\nwould not ask for Youth E to be moved.

Staff 1\nsaid Supervisor Z was dealing with Youth G who came around the\ncorner with self-harming cuts on her arm. Staff 1 said she was in\nfront of Youth H who tried to get by her to get to Case Manager,\nand Youth B and Youth C began to pull Staff 1 away from Youth H.\nStaff 1 said she had a “non-epileptic seizure” with no warning from\nbeing overwhelmed in the situation and tired from working so\nmany hours.

    "staff to call 911 in the middle of the incident due to concerns for\neveryone’s safety and the inability for staff to regain any control in\nthe facility. Staff 1 said when a youth AWOL’s the staff are to follow\nif the facility is still in ratio. Staff 1 said if they are not able to follow\nor if they do and lose sight of the youth, they are to contact the\nsupervisor and then the police, followed by all documentation on\nthe AWOL form. Staff 1 said she does not believe any youth were\non constant supervision on April 24, 2024. Staff 1 said when youth\nare placed on constant supervision they are to have “eyes on\nthem 24/7”. Staff 1 said staff are not assigned to specific youth but\nrather all staff communicate and make sure someone is watching\nthe youth. Staff 1 said they are to document checks as to what the\nyouth is doing every thirty minutes while youth are on constant\nsupervision. Staff 1 said there are not additional staff added to the\nschedule when youth are on constant supervision.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on May 7, 2024, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 2 said he has been\nemployed at New Hope Youth Center for one month. Staff 2\ndenied ever hearing any staff state they will not stop a youth from\nself-harming. Staff 2 said since Youth E has been at New Hope\nYouth Center things have been very chaotic. Staff 2 said Youth E\nhas claimed to cheek her medications, attempted to climb out a\nwindow, assaulted youth and staff, and threatens youth and staff\ndaily. Staff 2 said he typically works second shift with 2 other staff.\nStaff 2 said no additional staff have been added to support the\nsecond shift staff until a few days ago when a one-on-one was\nadded for Youth E which was helpful. Staff 2 said the evening of\nApril 24, 2024, was very overwhelming and chaotic. Staff 2 said\nYouth E and Youth H got into a physical altercation and he\nattempted to restraint Youth E and was punched several times.\nStaff 2 said as Youth E and Youth H were fighting, Staff 1 called\n911 for assistance, and attempted to help break up the fight and\nended up having a seizure. Staff 2 said there are times when he\nfeels he can keep the youth safe and there are other times when\nhe is not able to, noting 2 situations where he witnessed youth\nhaving to be barricaded in a bedroom to prevent Youth E from\ngetting to them. Staff 2 said the staff are to follow youth when they\nAWOL if ratio is able to be maintained in the facility. Staff 2 said\nonce line of sight of the youth is lost they are to call the police and\nsupervisor. Staff 2 said when youth are placed on constant\nsupervision the staff must provide line of sight supervision to that\nyouth. Staff 2 said when the youth go into the bathroom the staff\nare supposed to stand outside of the bathroom and talk to them to\nensure they are not self-harming. Staff 2 said the bathroom door is\nallowed to be shut as long as staff stands outside the door and the\n9",

Supervisor Z said when a\nyouth is placed on constant supervision there is a message placed\nin the group chat to notify staff and Therapist will also inform staff\nonce they get to the facility. Supervisor Z said as the shift\nsupervisor she will assign a staff to the youth that is on constant\nsupervision to provide line of sight supervision to that youth.\nSupervisor Z said the staff is to document what the youth is doing\nat thirty-minute intervals. Supervisor Z said there are many times\nthat the facility will be very busy or chaotic which proves\nchallenging to keep line of sight of youth that are on constant\nsupervision. Supervisor Z said she is aware of times when youth\nare not in line of sight due to a lack of staffing to provide that level\nof supervision. Supervisor Z said they need an additional staff to\nbe scheduled to provide that level of supervision to the youth that\nare on constant supervision, but she has been told that\nadministration will not allow for the additional staffing. Supervisor\nZ said since Youth E has been placed at New Hope Youth Center\nthere have been many more issues on second shift. Supervisor Z\nsaid Youth E has been AWOLing with other youth, assaulting staff\nand youth, verbally threatening staff and youth, and attempted to\nburn the house down by starting the stovetop and placing paper\ntowel on the burner. Supervisor Z said Youth E’s behaviors are\nalmost daily and she has asked the Facility Administrator and\nAssistant Facility Administrator for more supports on her shifts\nhowever no additional staff or support has been given or added.\nSupervisor Z said there are 3 staff scheduled on first shift, 3 staff\nscheduled on second shift, and 2 staff scheduled on third shift.\nSupervisor Z said Youth E has not been placed on a safety plan, a\none-on-one, or any other increased level of supervision.\nSupervisor Z said Youth E beats up the other youth and the staff\nand many times she does not feel she has the tools in order to\nkeep youth safe in the facility. Supervisor Z said she has never\nheard any staff state they would be unwilling to stop a youth if they\nare self-harming. Supervisor Z said on April 24, 2024, there were\nmany issues on second shift. Supervisor Z said Youth G was on\nconstant supervision for self-harming the day prior, however had\nwent AWOL, was brought back to the facility by police, self-\nharmed and was brought to the hospital. Supervisor Z said she is\nunaware if Youth G was searched upon her return from AWOL.\nSupervisor Z said Youth E and Youth H began to physically fight\n10",
    "and Youth G went into the bathroom, Case Manager checked on\nher and Youth G reported she was ok however then a few minutes\nlater came out of the bathroom and had cut herself and was\nbleeding. Supervisor Z said during the physical altercation a mirror\nhad been broken and when Youth G came out of the bathroom,\nshe grabbed a piece of the glass from the mirror and ran outside\nwhere the police “caught” her and put her in the ambulance and\nbrought her to the emergency room. Supervisor Z said Youth A\nhad self-harmed prior to the physical altercation between Youth E\nand Youth H and was in the basement with Case Manager\nreceiving medical care for those cuts. Supervisor Z said Youth A’s\nwounds at that time were superficial and she was not brought to\nthe emergency room during Supervisor Z’s shift. Supervisor Z said\nduring the physical altercation between Youth E and Youth H, Staff\n1 had a seizure. Supervisor Z said this was the second time Staff\n1 had a seizure at work, the first time being a few months ago\nwhen she was overwhelmed and had worked many hours.\nSupervisor Z said she and Youth D were tending to Staff 1 when\nthe police arrived and took over. Supervisor Z presented as very\noverwhelmed and tearful during the interview, stating so much has\ngone on at the facility that she has trouble remembering the\nsequence of events for specific days as they all blend together.\nSupervisor Z said if a youth AWOL’s the staff are to follow if ratio\nallows and if they are not able to follow or they lose sight of youth\nthey are to call the police.\nMedical Technician was interviewed face-to-face at the facility\non April 29, 2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker.\nMedical Technician said she had been working at New Hope Youth\nCenter for one month, and prior to this was working for the same\ncompany at Osceola Youth Center as a youth specialist. Medical\nTechnician said since the placement of Youth E, the facility has\nhad “a lot going on” and she has been very overwhelmed and had\nto come in on her days off and has been working every day for\nmany weeks. Medical Technician said Youth E has been very\nproblematic since her third day at the facility. Medical Technician\nsaid Youth E will escalate “straight to 100” and assault staff, youth,\nand destroy property. Medical Technician said several staff have\nquit due to the chaos in the house and feeling overwhelmed.\nMedical Technician said there are 2 staff scheduled for first shift, 3\nstaff for second shift, and 2 for third shift. Medical Technician said\nthere have not been any additional staff added to the schedule\ndespite the almost daily issues on second shift. Medical\nTechnician said the staff working will send out a message in the\ngroup chat for assistance from staff who are able to come into\nwork and she will respond and try to help as much as possible.\n11",
    "Medical Technician said on April 24, 2024, she saw message in\nthe group chat that things were “going bad” at the facility. She\nvolunteered to go and sit at the hospital with Youth A and Youth G.\nMedical Technician said while at the hospital someone from\nCommunity Mental Health came to evaluate Youth A to determine\nif she needed inpatient hospitalization. Medical Technician said\nshe tried to advocate for Youth A and make a statement that she\nwould not get hit by a car for Youth A. Medical Technician said this\ncomment was made in the hallway and out of earshot of Youth A.\nMedical Technician said she was just very tired and overwhelmed\nfrom working so many days in a row but that she would never\nallow a youth to be harmed on her watch. Medical Technician said\nwhen youth AWOL the staff are to follow if they are able to stay in\nratio at the facility. Medical Technician said if they cannot follow or\nlose sight of the youth they are to make all AWOL notifications,\nincluding calling the police. Medical Technician said there have\nbeen “a few” youth on “constant supervision” due to their\nbehaviors of self-harm. Medical Technician said “constant\nsupervision” requires staff to maintain line of sight of the youth,\nhowever no additional staff are added to the schedule, so she is\nunsure of how staff are keeping constant supervision of youth and\nsupervising the other youth in the house. Medical Technician said\nstaff are also supposed to document checks of what the youth that\nare on constant supervision are doing in 15 minutes intervals\nduring the day and 5-minute intervals at night.\nCase Manager was interviewed via telephone by me and face-\nto-face by MDHHS worker at the facility on May 7, 2024. Case\nManager said she has been employed since November 2023,\nworking as a youth specialist at the Osceola Youth Center site and\nmoving to New Hope Youth Center in January 2024 as the case\nmanager. Case Manager said Therapist places youth on constant\nsupervision and then staff are informed via group text or in person.\nCase Manager said staff are expected to being within three feet of\nthe youth and document every thirty minutes during the day and\nfive minutes at night what the youth is doing. Case Manager said\nwhen the youth go into the bathroom staff are expected to stand\nwith a foot in the door and the youth is supposed to talk or sing to\nensure safety. Case Manager said Youth E has been assaultive\nsince her third day at New Hope Youth Center at which time she\nhas punched Case Manager. Case Manager said she has been\nassaulted by Youth E on multiple occasions. Case Manager said\nsince Youth E’s placement the facility has been very unstable\nhowever no additional staff had been added to the schedule to\nassist staff so she would often try to stay late to provide some\nsupport. Case Manager said she stayed late on April 24, 2024, to\n12",
    "support staff on second shift. Case Manager said Youth A self-\nharmed by cutting and therefore was in the basement with\nSupervisor Z getting cleaned and bandaged. Case Manager said\nSupervisor Z went back upstairs and Case Manager was in the\nbasement with Youth A and Youth F. Case Manager said she could\nhear Youth E yelling upstairs and felt the staff would need\nadditional support so made the choice to leave Youth A and Youth\nF in the basement unsupervised in order help upstairs. Case\nManager said she was not sure if Youth A was on constant\nsupervision at that time or not. Case Manager said she was aware\nthat Youth G was on constant supervision and once upstairs she\nchecked on Youth G who was in the bathroom unsupervised.\nCase Manager said she talked to Youth G through the door and\nsince she responded Case Manager thought she was not self-\nharming and walked away. Case Manager said youth had\nbarricaded themselves in the back hallway for safety. Case\nManager said she went to the entryway where the yelling was\ncoming from and saw Staff 1 “spinning in circles crying”,\nSupervisor Z crying and holding her fingers as she slide down the\nwall into a seated position, and Staff 2 attempting to keep Youth E\nin the hallway and away from Youth H. Case Manager said she\nstepped in front of Youth H to prevent her from getting to Youth E\nand Youth H grabbed her and began to hit her in the head with her\narm cast six times. Case Manager said she was able to get away\nfrom Youth H and tried to talk to Youth E. Youth C grabbed her\npulling her away from Youth E. Case Manager said Staff 1 fell to\nthe ground and started to have a seizure and she started to move\nthe furniture away from the area. Case Manager said Youth G\ncame out of the bathroom and had blood running down her arms,\ngrabbed a piece of broken glass from a mirror that was broken in\nthe fight, and ran out into the road and began to cut her arms in\nthe middle of the road. Staff 1 said she followed, and a car had to\nstop in order not to hit Youth G. Case Manager said Staff 1 had\nbeen on the phone with 911 prior to her seizure and the police\narrived as Youth G was in the road. They grabbed her and pulled\nher out of the road. Case Manager said an ambulance arrived as\nwell and took Youth G to the hospital. Case Manager said on May\n5, 2024, a group text went out that support was needed at the\nfacility, so she responded and ended up working 20.5 hours to try\nto support staff. Case Manager said during that shift Medical\nTechnician sustained a concussion, she was almost pushed down\nthe stairs, and the youth are out of control and staff cannot keep\nthem safe. Case Manager said she has been told not to call 911\nwithout permission from Facility Administrator or Assistant Facility\nAdministrator. Case Manager said she fears for her safety and the\nsafety of the youth in the program. Case Manager said she has\n13",
    "gone to Facility Administrator and Assistant Facility Administrator\nand asked for additional staff and have been told that they are\ntrying to hire more staff but do not put any additional staff on the\nschedule. Case Manager said they “cannot keep the girls safe\nwith this amount of staff on shift”. Case Manager said if a youth\nAWOL’s the staff are to follow if they can maintain ratio in the\nfacility. Case Manager said once line of sight is lost of the youth it\nis expected they call the police and report them AWOL.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on April\n29, 2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Therapist said\nshe has been employed fulltime at New Hope Youth Center since\nthe end of November 2023, and prior to that had done two years\nof contractual work for the facility. Therapist said she completes a\nsuicide assessment and self-harm assessment with youth that\ncould increase their supervision needs depending on the outcome.\nTherapist said she is the person that determines if a youth is\nplaced on constant supervision due to self-harm or suicidal\nideations and will put that information in the group chat. Therapist\nsaid in her experience putting a youth on constant supervision has\nonly been done for self-harm or suicidal ideation and any other\nissues would result in a safety plan which would be completed by\neither the Facility Administrator or Assistant Facility Administrator.\nTherapist said once she places a youth on constant supervision,\nthey are to continue that level of supervision until she determines\nit is not needed any longer and takes them off constant\nsupervision. Therapist said the expectation for youth that are on\nconstant supervision is to be in line-of-sight of staff at all times and\nstaff must log the youth’s behaviors every thirty minutes. Therapist\nsaid when youth that are on constant supervision use the\nbathroom the expectation is that staff will be outside the bathroom\ndoor with the door cracked open, stating some staff will utilize a\nfoot in the door. Therapist said as far as she is aware the staffing\npattern stays the same and it is the staff’s responsibility to\ncommunicate among each other who is providing the supervision\nto the youth that is on constant supervision. Therapist said she\nhas never had any staff tell her they are unable to provide\nconstant supervision with the staffing that they have on each shift.\nTherapist said she was aware of Youth E’s behaviors within the\nfacility towards staff and youth. Therapist said she did not place\nYouth E on increased supervision as she only does that for self-\nharm or suicidal ideations and that safety plans for behavioral\nissues are done by the Facility Administrator or Assistant Facility\nAdministrator. Therapist said Youth E was on a safety plan\nregarding her interactions with Youth H, stating they were not\nsupposed to be next to each other or spending time together.\n14",
    "Therapist said she has not been a part of the intake decision for\nthe last three youth placed. Therapist said she is provided the\nintake packet the day of placement to review. Therapist denied\nany staff coming to her for support or needing assistance with\nYouth E. Therapist said both Youth A and Youth G were on\nconstant supervision on April 24, 2024, for self-harm.\nAssistant Facility Administrator was interviewed face-to-face\nat the facility on April 29, 2024, in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. Assistant Facility Administrator said she has worked for\nNew Hope Youth Center for five months and has not worked at\nany other facilities previously. Assistant Facility Administrator said\nfor the past six weeks placement decisions are being made at the\ncorporate level and most recent three youth placed have been\ndifficult to manage. Assistant Facility Administrator said corporate\nwants the facility to have ten youth however Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said they do not have enough staff to maintain ratio\nunless she and other administrator’s work in ratio with the youth.\nAssistant Facility Administrator said Youth A has presented with\nself-harming behaviors such as cutting herself and running into\ntraffic several times. Assistant Facility Administrator said Youth A\nhas been brought into the hospital and had psychological\nevaluations completed however has always been released back to\nthe facility and placed on constant supervision. Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said constant supervision is determined by Therapist\nand is increased supervision of the youth where staff have to keep\nline of sight on the youth however it is not considered a one-on-\none and no additional staff are added to the schedule to\naccommodate this increased level of supervision. Assistant\nFacility Administrator said Therapist will notify all staff when a\nyouth is placed on constant supervision by putting a text in the\ngroup chat and then directly tells the staff in the facility and gives\nthem the constant supervision log to complete. Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said the staff are expected to have line of sight\nsupervision for the youth on constant supervision as well as\nprovide supervision to at least two other youth, stating “to be\nhonest, I don’t’ know how staff is handling it”. Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said Youth E was placed about three weeks ago and\nhas caused many issues since her second day at the facility.\nAbout a week ago Youth G was placed at the facility and there\nhave been ongoing issues daily since that time. Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said Youth E has no escalation period or signs of an\noutburst and will go “zero to a hundred” and physically assault\nstaff and youth. Assistant Facility Administrator denied Youth E\nbeing placed on increased supervision, noting that is only done by\nTherapist and for self-harm or suicidal ideations. Assistant Facility\n15",
    "Administrator said April 24, 2024, was a difficult evening stating\nshe was not working but was called in to assist in the emergency\nsituation at 8pm. Assistant Facility Administrator said Youth A and\nYouth G were self-harming and brought to the hospital and Youth\nE and Youth H got into a physical altercation. Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said Staff 1 had a seizure during the shift, noting this\nwas the second time this occurred with Staff 1. Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said several staff have quit or threatened to quit and\nare refusing to work in the facility without administration being in\nthe building. Assistant Facility Administrator said she has been\nworking evening and weekends and as many as sixteen hours in a\nrow to assist the staff. Assistant Facility Administrator said she\ncontacted Director of Quality Assurance due to feeling “at a loss”\nof what to do in order to support the staff and Director of Quality\nAssurance has agreed to come work on the floor at the facility to\nprovide support. Assistant Facility Administrator said she is very\nconcerned about the youth in the facility noting things have been\nvery chaotic with Youth E in the facility. Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said staff have come to her asking for additional\nstaff to be added to second shift however she is under pressure to\nmaintain staffing at ratio and not go over. Assistant Facility\nAdministrator said she has asked Facility Administrator for support\nand guidance on what she can do to support the staff and ensure\nsafety of the youth and has not been given any ideas or guidance.\nAssistant Facility Administrator said she has not heard any staff\nstate they would not stop a youth from self-harming and would be\nvery concerned to have any staff working with the youth if that was\ntheir statement.\nFacility Administrator was interviewed face-to-face at the\nfacility on April 29, 2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker.\nFacility Administrator said the intake process has changed and\nshe receives the packets for the youth and sends the information\nto Vice President of Program Development who reviews and\nmakes the final decision on intake of youth. Facility Administrator\nsaid recently Youth E, Youth F, and Youth G were placed within a\nshort timeframe. Facility Administrator said Youth E was placed on\nApril 4, 2024, and she was aware of the concerns regarding Youth\nE’s physical aggression and AWOL behaviors. Facility\nAdministrator said Youth E has been physically aggressive with\nother youth on several occasions which began three days after\nher placement and has not stopped. Facility Administrator said\nYouth E will do “the dirty work” for other youth at the facility, noting\nshe believed Youth H manipulates Youth E into doing things for\nher. Facility Administrator said Youth E has a history of AWOL and\nsubstance abuse issues and has returned from being AWOL with\n16",
    "a weed pen and alcohol. Facility Administrator said Youth E is\nquick to escalate and has witnessed Youth E slap Youth A without\nany provocation at all. Facility Administrator said Youth E is\n“absolutely not appropriate for the program at all” and was aware\nwithin the first week Youth E was not a good fit for their open\ntreatment program. Facility Administrator said no extra staff have\nbeen added to shifts despite the upheaval in the program since\nYouth E’s placement. Facility Administrator said Youth E was on a\nsafety plan regarding her interactions with Youth H due to\ninappropriate sexual behaviors however no other one-to-one\nstaffing or safety plan was in place for Youth E aggressive\nbehaviors. Facility Administrator said she never realized she could\nimplement a behavioral safety plan for a youth that was exhibiting\naggressive behaviors and did not think to place Youth E on any\nheighted supervision or safety plan. Facility Administrator said\nYouth E was discussed weekly in the staff meetings and staff were\n“aware and more visual” with Youth E around other youth. Facility\nAdministrator stated, “looking back now, no we didn’t have staffing\nappropriate to ensure child safety”. Facility Administrator said\nAssistant Facility Administrator is responsible for schedule and\nhas been given no parameters from corporate regarding how\nmany staff to have per shift. Facility Administrator said she has not\nheard any staff state they will not stop youth from self-harming.\nFacility Administrator said when a youth runs out of the house the\nstaff are expected to follow the youth as long as they can maintain\nratio in the facility. Facility Administrator said once a staff loses\nlight of sight of the youth, they are to call the police and make all\nnotifications to required individuals. Facility Administrator said the\nclinical department decides when youth need to be placed on\nconstant supervision and will notify staff through a group chat.\nFacility Administrator said the staff will provide line of sight\nsupervision of any youth on this status, remain within arm length,\nand document their behaviors every thirty minutes during the day\nand every five minutes at night. Facility Administrator said youth\nare required to meet with Therapist and be assessed prior to being\ntaken off constant supervision status. Facility Administrator said\nwhen a youth is placed on constant supervision the shift\nsupervisor should assign a staff to provide the supervision and\ncomplete the documentation, however stated this is not currently\nhappening. Facility Administrator said the staff providing the\nsupervision of the youth may change throughout the shift and that\nstaff are responsible for communicating that between one another.\nFacility Administrator said there are no additional staff added to\nthe schedule to accommodate youth on constant supervision and\nthat staff are required to provide the high level of supervision and\nstay within ratio. Facility Administrator said all staff are trained on\n17",

Sheriff said he has responded to New Hope Youth\nCenter along with Michigan State Police, Mount Pleasant City\nPolice, and Tribal Police. Sheriff said he believes the facility is\nunderstaffed and has a mix of youth that do not coincide well\nwhich leads to “exploding” times. Sheriff said the most recent\npolice calls have been for AWOL incidents, youth assaulting each\nother, youth assaulting staff, and property damage. Sheriff said\nwhen he arrives “it is absolute chaos in the facility”. Sheriff said his\ndepartment, Michigan State Police, and ambulances from two\nother agencies responded on April 24, 2024, due to youth going\nAWOL and youth harming themselves. Sheriff said he called and\ntalked to Vice President of Program Development who reported\nnot knowing the issues at the facility due to living in Florida. Sheriff\nsaid sometimes the “problematic youth” will be moved out of the\nfacility and it becomes “less chaotic” but that seems to only last a\nshort time. Sheriff stated “I’m certain that house is going to burn to\nthe ground. Something real serious is going to happen in that\nhouse. It’s just a matter of time.”\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage of April 24, 2024, kitchen, hallway, entryway,\nand living room was reviewed on May 9, 2024.
