INVESTIGATION\nThe actual complainant is not clearly known.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central.\nDescription (1) The agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\ncontact with children or parents to be a person who has the\nability, experience, education, and training to perform the\nduties assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The worker falsified information about a birth parent's children and\ngave false information in court.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nBirth Parent C\nI attempted contact with Birth Parent C related to the allegations\nby telephone on 11/18/2023 and 12/5/2023 without success. Birth\nParent C was reported be in a protected setting; and I left a\ntelephone message for her on 12/5/2023. I never received a return\ncall back.\nBirth Parent D\nOn 12/5/2023 I interviewed Birth Parent D by telephone. Birth\nParent D reported the allegation was true. He reported what the\nworker gave false information about in court was that she said he\ndoes not get along with his children, which was false and also\ndisrespectful. Additionally, the worker reported that his mother\nhad missed a visit with his daughters, which was not true.\nRelative E\nRelative E was interviewed by me via telephone on 12/5/2023.\nRelative E is Birth Parent D’s mother. Relative E reported Worker\n4 told the court that she never showed up for visits that were set\n2",
    "up for Relative E by other agencies. Relative E said that was not\ntrue because during that time visits were occurring at her home.\nShe said it was Worker 4 who was not forthcoming about a visit.\nShe said Worker 4 scheduled a visit for her with Child A on\n11/30/2023 but did not inform her about it. Birth Parent D told her\nabout the visit, so that she did not miss it.\nRelative F\nRelative F was interviewed by me via telephone on 12/5/2023.\nRelative F did not report any information related to this allegation.\nSupervisor 3\nOn 12/8/2023 I interviewed Supervisor 3 by video conference via\nTEAMS. She was not aware of Worker 4 making any false\nstatements about this case in court.\nWorker 4\nOn 12/8/2023 I interviewed Worker 4 by telephone. Worker 4 was\nnot aware or any false statements she would have made in court.\nI asked her whether there was a visit scheduled for Relative E on\n11/30/2023 which she did not tell Relative E, about, or if she\nreported Relative E had missed visits anywhere, or at any time.\nShe denied such. She reported not knowing why it was being\nreported that she did not tell Relative E about the visit. She said\nshe contacted Relative E on 11/15/2023 to tell her there would be\na visit on 11/30/203. Then on 11/22/2023 after a parenting time for\nBirth Parent D at the office, Relative E was in the lobby, and she\ntold Relative E again about the visit on 11/30/2023. She did not\nrecall documenting such in a social work contact but thought at\nleast one contact showed her contact with Relative E prior to the\n11/30/2023 visit.\nDocument Review:\nChild A and Child B’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n➢ Child A’s and Child B’s case was assigned to Wolverine on\n2/8/2023.\n➢ A 11/22/2023 social work contact about a parenting time for\nBirth Parent D, which did not document Worker 4 telling\nRelative E about a visit but showed her having\ncommunication with Relative E during the time Relative E\nwas in the lobby. Also, a 11/30/2023 social work contact\ndocumenting a visit for Child A and Child B that showed\nRelative E in attendance and enjoying the visit.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation, there is insufficient\nevidence to support the allegation. Nor that Worker 4 did not have\n3",
    "the ability, experience, education, and training to perform the\nduties assigned.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\nSection (3) An agency shall require that a social service worker be\nDescription directly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in-out-of-home care.\nSocial services workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be primarily\nresponsible for the development, implementation, and review\nof services plans for the children and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The worker did things to block reunification and was disrespectful\nto the family and children. Additionally, the worker tried to block\nrelatives from getting care of the birth parents’ children from foster\ncare because the worker's friend is the children's foster parent.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nBirth Parent C\nI attempted contact with Birth Parent C related to the allegations\nby telephone on 11/18/2023 and 12/5/2023 without success. Birth\nParent C was reported be in a protected setting; and I left a\ntelephone message for her on 12/5/2023. I never received a return\ncall back.\nBirth Parent D\nOn 12/5/2023 I interviewed Birth Parent D by telephone. Birth\nParent D reported the allegations were true. He said Worker 4\ntried to make it seem as if no one on his side of the family wanted\nto plan for his children. He reported his family tried to get his\nyoungest daughter, Child A placed with his brother, Relative F;\nand the agency/Worker 4 put up road blocks against Relative F.\nBirth Parent D did not elaborate on what he meant by road blocks.\nHe said his mother, Relative E, as well as his brother, Relative F\nhas tried to get placement of Child A since June 2023. He said,\nRelative E was doing things to fix her house and also took the\nclasses to become a licensed foster parent. Additionally, his\nmother, Relative E submitted clearances to get her, and her house\napproved, but Worker 4 was not keeping Relative E, nor Relative\nF aware of what was going on related to Child A and the case\n4",
    "plan. Nor did Worker 4 or her supervisor return Relative F’s\nphone calls related to planning for Child A.\nHe reported Worker 4 did come to check his mother’s house out,\nand also Relative F’s, but the agency placed Child A with Birth\nParent C’s parents (Relative G and Relative H) on 12/4/2023\ninstead. He reported that was interesting since Relative G and\nRelative H had placement of his oldest daughter, Child B; and\nRelative G had not wanted Child A prior. Relative G and Relative\nH only recently had a desire to care for Child A.\nI asked Birth Parent D whether the agency tried to block him from\nplanning for Child A and Child B. He reported he was incarcerated\nfor a while, but the agency reached out to him via letters to let him\nknow what was going on. They also visited his home once he was\nreleased on 10/22/2023. He said both of his daughters’\npermanency plan now is to live with Relative G and Relative H. He\nreported his concern is that the agency didn’t timely pursue his\nbrother for placement of Child A, would not allow visitation for his\nbrother; was disrespectful to them by not telling the truth about\nthese relatives being available to plan for his children; and about\nhis mother missing a visit that was scheduled for her which she\nhad no knowledge about. He said his mother went eight months\nwithout being able to see Child A; and when a visit was scheduled\nfor her to see Child A for two hours, he told her it was scheduled\nas opposed to Worker 4. Also, since the agency would not allow\nRelative F to see his girls, Relative F had to go through Ennis to\nget licensed in hopes of getting Child A. He said both Relative E\nand Relative F could verify this information.\nRelative E\nOn 12/5/2023 I interviewed Relative E by telephone. Person XX\n(reported to be the partner to Relative F) was also on the\ntelephone line with Relative E, and would periodically interject\nstatements. Relative E reported caring for Child B in the past\nwhen Birth Parent C lived with her for 18 months. She said Birth\nParent C later left Child B with Relative G; and subsequently Child\nA and Child B became involved with foster care. Relative E\nreported after Child A's and Child B’s case was assigned to\nWolverine, she has had difficulties seeing the girls due to a lack of\ncontact from the agency. She said she was trying to get visits with\nChild A and Child B in her home; and her son, Relative F was\ntrying to get placement of both girls. She reported calling Worker 4\nover 10 times; and calling Supervisor 2 at least four times (in the\nlast 6 weeks) and none of her calls were ever returned. She later\nsaid Supervisor 3 did call her back. Supervisor 3 told her,\n5",
    "Supervisor 3 would make arrangements for Relative E’s home to\nbe checked out, so that the agency could bring Child A and Child\nB to her for visitation.\nRelative E reported the agency was not trying to work with them\nShe and Person XX said Worker 4 only reached out to Relative F\nonce. Relative E reported the way she was able to see both girls\nin August 2023, was after Relative G invited her to a sibling visit\nfor Child A in Relative G’s home. Relative E said Worker 4 did not\nknow she was going to be at the sibling visit; and Worker 4 was\nupset about her being present. Relative E reported after that her\nattorney contacted Wolverine on their behalf. She believes this\nwas how she was able to get later visits.\nRelative E reported that Worker 4 never returned her contacts;\nand never gave the agency’s licensing department her or Relative\nF’s information related to them wanting to plan for/be involved with\nChild A and Child B. Though, Relative E also reported it was only\nafter she left a message for Administrator 2 at the end of\nSeptember or early October 2023 did Worker 4 follow up with her.\nShe also reported Worker 4 came to check out her home in\nAugust 2023; and sent a licensing worker to her home in October\n2023 to check it out. Relative E reported when the licensing\nworker came to her home, that worker was in error. That worker\nwas to have gone to Relative F’s home, because he wanted\nplacement of the girls. She only wanted home visits; but Worker 4\nhad given the licensing worker the wrong information. The\nlicensing worker said her home was okay for visitation.\nRelative E believes all of this miscommunication and delay by\nWolverine blocked their ability to plan for Child A and Child B.\nShe believes Worker 4 being brief with her during an initial phone\ncontact in August 2023 and telling her to contact her attorney was\nWorker 4 being rude and disrespectful to her.\nRelative E reported knowing that Child A was placed in a foster\nhome that is a friend of Worker 4 because during Worker 4’s visit\nto her home, Worker 4 reported such. She had asked how Child A\nwas doing in the foster home and Worker 4 stated the foster\nparent’s first name; and said they need not worry. Worker 4 said\nthat foster parent is a good foster parent; and is a friend of her's.\nRelative F\nOn 12/5/2023 I interviewed Relative F by telephone. Relative F\nreported he had experienced aspects of the allegations, in that he\nfeels he was never offered the opportunity to get his nieces, Child\n6",
    "A and Child B. He said he was making calls to Worker 4, and she\nwas not returning his call. He did not report when he started\ncalling Worker 4 or the agency. He reported during his quest to\nget placement of the girls he showed up for an August 2023\nsibling visit, at Relative G’s and Relative H’s home. At that time\nWorker 4 insisted he leave the visit but spoke with him afterward.\nHe inquired of Worker 4 how to get visitation with Child A and\nChild B. Worker 4 told him to provide her with his driver license\nand social security number so that clearances could be ran. On\nthis August 2023 date Relative F reported learning from Worker 4\nthat the telephone number he had goggled for Wolverine and was\ncalling/ leaving messages for Worker 4 was not the correct\nnumber for the agency. On that date Worker 4 gave him her\nbusiness card with her correct contact information; and he\nprovided her the information she needed for clearances a short\ntime thereafter. Two weeks later he called Worker 4 to check the\nstatus of his clearance checks. Worker 4 told him she turned his\npaper work over to the agency’s licensing department and there\nwas nothing more she could do. Worker 4 made him feel as if he\nwas being a nuisance. Worker 4 did not say he was being a\nnuisance; Relative F felt Worker 4’s tone of voice suggested that.\nRelative F said Wolverine never assessed his home, but he\ncompleted the licensing process via Ennis.\nRelative F reported Wolverine recently told him he would not be\nlooked at for placement of the girls because Child A and Child B\nare already placed with a relative. Relative F reported that’s true\nnow; but it was not true for Child A at first. Child A was placed in a\nfoster home that was a friend of Worker 4’s. He reported knowing\nthe latter because of what Worker 4 told him and his\nmother/Relative E. He repeated basically what Relative E, had\nreported related to the Worker 4/foster parent friendship\nallegation. He said the agency never said that other relative\nplacement situation was why they were not considering him.\nRelative F reported thinking Child A’s placement situation/her\nbeing placed with the other relatives only recently as “shady\ndealing”. He reported that to Supervisor 3. He reported having\ncontact with Supervisor 3 after Worker 4 was not returning his\nmany calls. He said, Supervisor 3 said he should deal with her.\nHe said when he first made contact with the agency, the agency\nnever told him they were trying to get Child A placed with Relative\nG and Relative H. That when he started the process, Birth Parent\nC and his brother (Birth Parent D, who was incarcerated), were\nboth in favor of him getting placement of both, Child A and Child\nB; as well as him having visits with them. He said the birth\nparents contacted their attorneys to say they were okay with him\n7",
    "as a placement plan. Birth Parent D’s attorney also contacted\nWolverine to say there was a relative willing to take placement of\nthe children. He believes Wolverine pushed back against the plan.\nWolverine only told him to not worry; that Child A was in a good\nfoster home. He reported, that since both girls are in a relative\nplacement now, the agency told him he would not be assessed\nunless Birth Parent C’s and Birth Parent D’s parental right are\nterminated. He reported being happy that Child A and Child B\nare placed together/are united, but surprised that Relative G and\nher family took placement of both girls, when Relative G had\nquestioned taking care of two children. He reported just wanting to\nbe there for the girls and wanting the agency to know that.\nSupervisor 3\nOn 12/8/2023 I interviewed Supervisor 3 by video conference via\nTEAMS. She denied the allegations. She reported when Child\nA’s and Child B’s case transferred to Wolverine in February 2023;\nChild B was already placed with Relative H and Relative G.\nRelative E had previously cared for Child B, but there were issues\nwith that home; and that may be why Child A was not placed\nthere. Child A was placed in a foster home; and there were no\nother known relatives willing to plan for Child A at the time.\nSupervisor 3 said Relative F did not come forth about possibly\nplanning for Child A until August or September of 2023. The\nagency completed clearances on him.\nShe reported no knowledge of phone calls not being returned by\nWorker 4. Worker 4 never shared with her that relatives were\nregularly calling her. Supervisor 3 reported she has never\nobserved Worker 4 with these relatives, but she has no reason to\nbelieve that Worker 4 would be rude or disrespectful to them. She\nsaid Worker 4 has been an employee of good standing for over\nfour years.\nAs for Relative E’s and Relative F’s interest in planning for Child\nA, Supervisors 3 reported there was discussion with Relative F\nand Relative E about their interest in placement. They asked who\nwanted to be explored first. Relative E’s home was explored first\nbecause Relative E submitted her clearance request information\nfirst. Worker 4 got the paper work from Relative E on 8/29/2023;\nand Relative F submitted information on 9/1/2023. That paper\nwork was turned over to Supervisor 3 in September 2023. She\nran criminal history clearances on Relative E on 9/27/2023, and a\nchildren protective service (CPS) clearance some time prior to\n10/2/2023. She turned Relative E’s paperwork over to the\nagency’s licensing department on 9/28/203; and Relative F’s\n8",
    "thereafter, after running criminal history and subsequently CPS\nclearances on Relative F and his LTP (Living Together Partner).\nShe reported their licensing department went out to Relative E’s\nhome to check it out for placement on 10/2/2023. At that time\nRelative E was confused, Relative E did not seem to know the\nlicensing worker was there to assess her home for placement of\nChild A. At that time, Relative E stated she did not want placement\nof Child A. She only wanted to have visits in her home, which is\nnot what the agency had previously been told.\nSupervisor 3 reported the agency did not ultimately follow up with\na home visit of Relative F’s home because, Relative G called the\nagency to say she wanted placement of Child A. The agency\ndiscussed this option, because it was an opportunity to have Child\nA be with her sister. This placement option was also discussed\nwith Child A’s and Child B’s GAL (Guardian Ad Litem); and this\nplan was recommended/agreed as in the girls’ better interest.\nSupervisor 3 reported that’s when they let Relative F know what\nwould be happening with Child A’s placement; and what they\ncould do should Child A’s placement with the maternal\ngrandparents not work out. Relative F was okay with that.\nRelative F asked her what happens if the birth parents rights get\nterminated and Supervisor 3 explained that to him. Supervisor 3\nreported since that conversation with Relative F in November\n2023, as of 12/8/2023, Birth Parent C and Birth Parent D were\nvoluntarily releasing their parental rights.\nAs for Child A allegedly being placed in a foster home with Worker\n4’s friend, Supervisor 4 denied such. She said Birth Parent D\nbrought that matter up at an FTM (Family Team Meeting) and they\nreported it not to be true then. She said Foster Parent XY, and\nWorker 4 are not personal friends. Worker 4 had another foster\nchild placed in Foster Parent XY’s home and has a good working\nrelationship with Foster Parent XY. Worker 4’s statements to the\nrelatives about Foster Parent XY’s home being a good foster\nhome would have been based on a worker/foster parent\nrelationship, nothing personal.\nWorker 4\nOn 12/5/2023 I interviewed Worker 4 by telephone. Worker 4\ndenied the allegations. She reported neither Relative E, or\nRelative F made calls to her that were not returned. Nor that she\nwas disrespectful to either. Nor that she tried to block any family\nmember’s desire to get placement of Child A or Child B. She\nadvised that Child B was already in placement with Relative G and\nRelative H when the agency was assigned this case. Thereon,\n9",
    "she was working with Birth Parent C and Birth Parent D, prior to\nBirth Parent C’s July 2023 in-patient rehabilitation; and Birth\nParent D’s June 2023 incarceration.\nShe reported Relative F never called her about planning for the\nchildren. He just showed up for a parenting time at Relative G’s\nand Relative H’s home on August 9, 2023. On that date Relative\nF did report wanting to plan for Child A; and she advised him\nclearances were required prior to him being allowed contact with\nthe children. She gave him her business card. She affirmed\nRelative F’s report pertaining to him having an incorrect contact\nnumber for Wolverine, him submitting paperwork for clearances\nsometime in September 2023; and a follow up contact from him in\nOctober 2023.\nWorker 4 reported Relative E had reported wanting to plan for\nChild A first. Relative E was showing up for her son, Birth Parent\nD’s parenting time; and Relative E submitted clearance\npaperwork, which Worker 4 reported turning over to their licensing\ndepartment. Worker 4 also confirmed the outcome of the\nagency’s licensing worker’s home assessment visit to Relative E’s\nhome. Relative E did report at that time it was not her intent to\nobtain placement of Child A but to get visits in her home.\nAdditionally, Worker 4 affirmed Supervisor 3’s reporting related to\nthe agency’s placement of Child A with her sister, Child B, in the\nhome of Relative G and Relative H; how that placement came to\nbe; and the agency’s explanation to Relative F as to not moving\nforward and exploring his home due to reuniting the siblings.\nLastly Worker 4 denied being a personal friend of the foster parent\nChild A had been placed with. Nor telling any of Child A’s family\nmembers she was. She reported similar information as reported\nby Supervisor 3, that she and Foster Parent XY had a good\nworking relationship based on her having a prior foster child in\nplacement with Foster Parent XY.\nDocument Review\nChild A’s and Child B’s MISACWIS case which showed:\n• Child A’s and Child B’s case was assigned to Wolverine on\n2/8/2023.\n• Child B was placed in Relative H’s and Relative G’s home\non 3/17/2022.\n• Child A was placed in Foster Parent XY’s home on\n2/8/2023.\n10",
    "• The children’s case plan was reunification at the time of\nplacement; and thereon the agency was working with the\nbirth parents.\n• Child A was replaced from Foster Parent XY’s home and\nplaced with Child B in Relative H’s and Relative G’s home\non 12/1/2023.\n• Child B and Child A were made temporary court wards on\n3/17/2022 and 11/28/2022 respectively. They were made\npermanent court wards on 12/8/2023.\n• An FTM dated 11/7/2023 showing Relative G and Relative\nH being explored for placement of Child A to unite siblings.\nInformation indicating Relative E only wants visitation;\nRelative F to be explored for placement if the other\nrelatives do not work out.\n• Social work contacts showing contact with relatives about\nplacement, inclusive of contact by Worker 4 with Relative F\non 9/1/2023. Also, Supervisor 3 with Birth Parent C about\nRelative F on 11/7/2023; and with Relative F on 11/8/2023\nabout Relative F’s placement interest and the agency’s\ncurrent plan/exploration to unite siblings. Both Birth Parent\nC and Relative F reporting they understood that.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation, there is insufficient\nevidence to support the allegations or to support that the worker\ndid not work with the children, their families, and other relevant\nindividuals related to the children’s service’s plan.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the agency current licensing status is recommended.\nJanuary 13, 2024\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 25, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n11"
