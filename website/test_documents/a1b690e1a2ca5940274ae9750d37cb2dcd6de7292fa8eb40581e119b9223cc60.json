METHODOLOGY\n11/04/2021 Special Investigation Intake\n2022C0108004\n11/04/2021 Special Investigation Initiated - Letter\nCoordinated with SI Team of Consultants\n11/04/2021 Inspection Completed On-site\nObserved both bathrooms/showers and carpet outside electrical\nroom in Juhnke Cottage, requested repair invoice, observed crates\nof food being brought to cottage by kitchen staff and full\nrefrigerator; interviewed Youth A, Staff 1 and Supervisor 1, Spoke\nwith Residential Director 1; observed medication room and\nreviewed Youth A's medication log via computer; met two food\nservices specialists and Director of Food Services.\n11/08/2021 Pre-Exit with CA 1\nALLEGATION:\nYouth A reported mold in the shower for at least five months, which he believes is giving\nhim headaches.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn-site Observations\nI arrived at Juhnke cottage on 11/4/21 at 10:45am. Youth A showed me the two\nyouth bathrooms in the cottage. In bathroom A I observed a substantial amount of\nblack grime/mildew on the grout between the white tiles on the walls and the ceiling.\nIn bathroom B there was a moderate amount of grime on the grout on the walls and\nceiling. Both bathrooms had brown/black dirt/grime in the corners of the floor and in\n2",
    "the creases at the bottom of the shower doors. The surfaces of both floors had just\nbeen mopped by Staff 1 and were still wet.\nYouth A showed me a locked door labeled the electrical room. He said liquid\nchemicals leak underneath the door onto the carpet and into his bedroom. I touched\nthe carpet near the electrical room door, and it was dry.\nFinally, Youth A showed me a black loveseat. He refused to sit on it because he said\nit was taken from a dumpster and smells bad. The back cushions on the loveseat\nwere torn and the curtain hanging above it was shredded.\nI observed a large metal lockbox attached to the wall intended for youth grievances.\nI interviewed Youth A, age 17, privately. He has been at Juhnke since 6/8/21.\nAsked who cleans the bathrooms, he said the youth are supposed to clean them. I\nasked Youth A why he attributes his headaches to the “mold” in the bathrooms. He\nresponded, “because when I go in there, my head hurts.” Youth A said he has never\ntold the staff about his headaches and has not sought medical attention; therefore,\nthe cause of his headaches could not be determined. He said he was aware of the\ngrievance procedure, but he has never written a grievance.\nI interviewed Staff 1. She has worked at the facility for 10 years but was just moved\nto Juhnke Cottage last month. I asked Staff 1 who cleans the bathrooms. She said\nthe boys or midnight shift staff are supposed to. “I mopped them today with one\nyoung man, but maintenance should get the mold off…Supervisor 1 said he made\nseveral requests.”\nI interviewed Supervisor 1. He has worked at Methodist for over eight years.\nSupervisor 1 said he has put in “plenty of maintenance requests” to clean the\nbathrooms in Juhnke. However, he was unable to produce any documentation\nsupporting these requests.\nIn terms of the electrical room leak, Supervisor 1 said it leaked water, not chemicals.\n“Someone came a couple weeks ago and fixed it.” CA 1 confirmed the leak was\nrepaired by maintenance.\nRegarding the loveseat, Supervisor 1 denied that it came from a dumpster. “It was\ndonated. It wasn’t ripped when we got it…A staff texted me that she just went and\nbought some curtains out of her own money.” Chief Administrator 1 (CA1) indicated\nthe facility has already ordered sturdy “behavioral health furniture” for all the\ncottages and is waiting for delivery.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4407 Facility and premises maintenance.\n(1) A facility and premises shall be maintained in a clean,\ncomfortable, and safe condition. The facility shall be\nlocated on land that is properly drained.\nANALYSIS: On 11/4/21 I observed a substantial amount of black\ngrime/mildew on the walls and ceilings, as well as dirt/grime on\nthe floors and shower doors of the youth bathrooms in Juhnke\nCottage.\nCONSULTATION\nYouth should utilize Methodist’s grievance process when they\nhave complaints that can be resolved internally. RD 1 said she\nhas recently re-explained the grievance process to staff and\nasked their supervisors to have weekly house meetings as\nanother way to allow youth to express their concerns. RD 1\nagreed stating “kids (families and referral sources) need to be\nencouraged to use the grievance process” to give the facility a\nchance to resolve issues that don’t rise to the level of child\nabuse or neglect.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nYouth are not getting enough food in each of the food groups. Staff have bought food for\nyouth with their own money.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI asked Youth A if he gets enough food in all the five food groups. He said once he\nwas served noodles, macaroni, and cheese for lunch. “Sometimes there are no\nvegetables or meat,” he added. Youth A was unable to recall any other meal that\nwas insufficient. “Supervisor 1 will go buy meat if there’s no meat. He makes sure\nwe got seconds.”\nI asked Staff 1 about the youth’s food. “My opinion they don’t give them enough. I\nnever seen no vegetables or all the right things at breakfast or lunch.” Staff 1\nclarified that she was only referring to the last two-week period at Juhnke and not\nthe whole campus for the past 10 years. She also admitted she is not familiar with\nthe food types or quantities that meet the nutritional allowances recommended by\nUSDA guidelines.\n4",
    "Before interviews began, two food service specialists entered the cottage delivering\na crate and aluminum tray full of food. This was the day’s lunch and dinner and\ntomorrow’s breakfast for the eight youth in the cottage. Staff 1 and two other youths\nentered the immediate area. Staff 1 complained aloud to the kitchen staff asking why\nthere were no vegetables. One kitchen staff unpacked the crate revealing large bags\nof cinnamon rolls, bacon, frozen French fries, cheese and cracker snacks, chicken,\npears, granny smith apples, bread, sub buns, bologna, and cheese. The other\nkitchen staff opened the door to a full refrigerator containing large bags of lettuce,\nsalad dressing and red apples from the day before that had not been eaten. She\nsaid the kitchen will not bring more food when what they have is not being eaten.\nYouth A then proudly explained to me that “staff try to fight for us to get more food.”\nWhen the kitchen staff left, Youth A removed the foil from his breakfast plate\nrevealing two sausage patties and a biscuit, then threw his plate in the trash. I saw\nYouth K eating a second submarine sandwich for lunch.\nI asked Supervisor 1 if he buys the youth food with his own money. He said he will\nbuy “some extras on weekends while teaching kids to cook, but it’s not because they\ndon’t get enough food.”\nMethodist’s policy does not prohibit staff from purchasing food or other items with\ntheir own money.\nI spoke with Residential Director 1 (RD 1) about the food served to youth. She said\ncomplaints from youth at Juhnke cottage about not getting enough is not a new\nissue. “The kitchen staff have recently met with the supervisory team at least twice\nto resolve this. The kitchen follows the federal guidelines.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4149 Resident nutrition.\n(2) Meals shall be of sufficient quantity to meet the\nnutritional allowances recommended by USDA guidelines:\n(www.healthierus.gov/dietaryguidelines)\nANALYSIS: There is no evidence to support that meals served at Methodist\nare not of sufficient quantity according to USDA guidelines.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: Supervisor 1 admitted he has purchased food with his own\nmoney for the youth in his cottage and that another staff recently\nbought curtains. Methodist policy does not prohibit staff from\npurchasing items that benefit all of the youth.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nYouth A did not receive his medication on 11/1 and 11/2.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI observed the medication room and Youth A’s medication log via computer.\nI asked Youth A if he received his medication on the mornings of 11/1/21 and\n11/2/21. He said he did not get his medication on those days because his\nmedication ran out.\nI asked Supervisor 1 about Youth A missing two doses of his medication. He said\nthe nurses who refill medication both recently resigned. According to CA 1, the\nDirector of Children’s Services has taken on the responsibility of refilling medication\nuntil a new nurse is hired. Additionally in the interim, Supervisor 1 and Residential\nDirector 1 indicated that if youth require medical attention, they will be transported to\nurgent care.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all the\nfollowing:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: Youth A’s electronic medication log indicates he did not receive\nhis 8am doses of Concerta on 11/1/21 and 11/2/21.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRepeat Violations\n2021C0219034 - intake 4/26/21; CAP approved 6/15/21\n2021C0219016 – intake 12/4/20; CAP approved 3/1/21\n2020C0108024 – intake 1/22/20; CAP approved 2/19/20\nALLEGATIONS:\nThe facility is out of ratio in the mornings.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThere were three youth and one staff in the cottage on the morning of 11/4/21 which\nis consistent with the required staff-to-resident ratio. Consultant 1 observed the ratio\nin this cottage and others on 10/12/21 and 10/27/21 and found the facility in\ncompliance.\nYouth A knew that the required staff-to-resident ratio is 1:4, but he could not recall\nany specific instance where the cottage was not in ratio.\nStaff 1 works mornings from 6am – 2pm. and said Juhnke cottage is always in ratio\nof staff-to-youth.\nSupervisor 1 denied there is a shortage of direct care staff in Juhnke cottage. “This\ncottage is in ratio,” he affirmed.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(3) The ratio formula for direct care workers shall\ncorrespond with the institution's purpose and the needs of\nthe residents and shall assure the continual safety,\nprotection, and direct care and supervision of residents.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: The ratio of staff-to-residents is 1:4. On 10/12/21, 10/27/21 and\n11/04/21, licensing consultants observed Juhnke Cottage was\ncompliant with this rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nNovember 9, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 9, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n8"
