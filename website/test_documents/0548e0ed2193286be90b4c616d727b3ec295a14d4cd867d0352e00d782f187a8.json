    "summary": "The investigation concerned allegations that a youth with significant medical needs was not fed according to his prescribed diet and was transported to school in soiled briefs. While the malnutrition allegation was not substantiated, investigators established a violation for personal hygiene because a staff member admitted to failing to check or change the youth's briefs before transport, breaching the facility's care plan. The facility's administration bears culpability for this lapse in supervised care, as it indicates a failure in staff training or protocol adherence for a youth requiring 1:1 supervision.",
