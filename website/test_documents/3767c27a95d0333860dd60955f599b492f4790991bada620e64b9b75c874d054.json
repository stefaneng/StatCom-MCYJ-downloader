    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe corrective action plan was submitted in response to licensing renewal inspection\nreport dated 9/8/2022 and was approved on 9/23/2022. Compliance with that CAP\nhas been partially maintained as evidenced by 6 of the 17 violations addressed in\nthe 2022 CAP being resolved and not repeated this inspection. Of the 12 violations\nestablished during this inpection, 1 is a new citation and 11 are repeat violations.\nCompared to the 2022 inspection, the percentage of incidents of each repeat\nviolation has decreased siginificantly regarding caseload compliance, face to face\ncontacts, FTM's held, and PATP signatures. The percentage of incidents of non\ncompliance has remained the same for providing information to caregivers at\nplacement/re-placement and increased slightly regarding medical passports, service\nplan approval, and service plan timeliness. The precentage of incidents of non-\ncompliance reagrding documenting information required at placement/replacement\nas well as file maintenance increased significantly; however it is noted that, in 2022,\nthe agency was cited for falsifying documents, many of which were the documents\nfor placement/replacement. During this year's inspection, several documents were\ncompleted and/or uploaded outside of the required timeframe, resulting in the file\nmaintenance and the placement/replacement documentation citation, but none of\nthose documents were altered or backdated which is likely the cause of increased\nnumber of late/missing documents. Overall, the agency has demonstrated\nimplementation of the 2022 CAP and has demonstrated action toward improving\ncompliance.\nFinancial overview: No financial concerns were identified.\nChief Administrator Assessment: The chief administrator assessment was\nsubmitted and reviewed on 1/23/2023. The chief administrator identified issues\nrelated to staffing resulting in areas on non-compliance. The Chief Administrator\nindicated that the agency has made progress in hiring additional staffing, reducing\ncaseloads, and providing oversight; however, they are not yet fully staffed and have\nexperienced a 100% turnover in administration as well as worker turnover which has\nresulted in the previously approved CAP not yet meeting its full effectiveness.\nInterviews – The staff interviewed all reported being supported by their peers and\nimmediate superiors. The foster care workers reported that a reduction in caseload\nsizes has improved their ability to complete required tasks. They all expressed that\nthere have been challenges related to worker and leadership turnover, but they feel\nencouraged by the direction the current leadership is taking.",
    "Description of Agency Walkthrough: The agency was observed to have sufficient\noffice space and equipment. Case files are stored in a manner that is secure by\nutilizing a file room that can only be accessed by key cards, preventing unauthorized\naccess.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified 1 safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: The roof was leaking in one of the bedrooms where a child was placed\nin an unlicensed relative home.\nResolution: Foster Care and Licensing staff confirmed on 12/15/2022 that no\nchildren were sleeping or spending any time in the bedroom with the leak. The foster\ncare worker is assisting the family with obtaining FIG funds to make the needed\nrepairs.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 27, 2023\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 30, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
