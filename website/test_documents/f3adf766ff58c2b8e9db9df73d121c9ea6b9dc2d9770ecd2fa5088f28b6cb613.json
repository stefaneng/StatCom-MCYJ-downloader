She shared Youth\nA’s frequent sexual acting out behaviors, including making sexual\ncomments to youth and staff.

Therapist noted that this was the first instance of Youth\nA expressing alleged victimization of sexual abuse on the part of\nanyone else.\n2",
    "Youth A was interviewed on 12/11/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit. He reported the incident occurred about a\nmonth ago with Youth B. Youth A recalled being in the pod with\nYouth B in the middle of the day. Youth C was also present, and\nhe was sitting with Staff 1 at a table across the open area of the\npod. Youth A was standing with Youth B near Youth B’s bedroom\ndoor. Youth A described the door as open about halfway. Youth\nA stated Youth B grabbed Youth A’s shirt and pulled him behind\nthe doorway. Youth A recalled Youth B then pulling up his own\nshirt and lowering his pants. Youth A stated he performed a\nsexual act on Youth B. Youth A believed this lasted for about five\nminutes. Youth B did not say anything during this\ninteraction. Youth A stated he got up and walked away from\nYouth B. During this interaction Youth C and Staff 1 were still\nsitting at the same table. Youth A did not believe either Youth C\nor Staff 1 would have been able to see what had occurred. Youth\nA reported feeling more and more upset about it over the next\ncouple of days when he finally yelled out that this occurred while\nin the pod with the rest of the youth placed with him, and then he\ntold Therapist directly what had occurred. Youth A stated he has\nnot had any contact with Youth B since the incident or when he\ndisclosed what had occurred.\nYouth A’s Foster Care worker was interviewed over the phone on\n12/18/2024. He reported Youth A disclosing the allegations with\nhim around the same time Youth A had reported the concerns to\nTherapist. The Foster Care worker recalled Youth A reporting to\nhim that no one else was in the pod altogether when the incident\noccurred, and Youth B performed a sexual act on Youth A as\nopposed to the opposite. He also noted that the rest of what was\nreported was consistent with the original allegations presented for\nthis investigation, in that Youth A was the victim of sexual assault\non the part of Youth B and that this occurred behind a door to\nYouth B’s bedroom, obscuring a possible view of the incident.\nFoster Care worker noted Youth A had never mentioned Youth B’s\nname during his placement at the facility despite having multiple\nincidents involving fighting with Youth B prior to this allegation. He\nreported no concern about Youth A’s safety at the facility and\nstated that communication about Youth A’s case and this incident\nwas sufficient.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 01/29/2025. Staff 1\nrecalled the situation when Youth A alleged he had been sexually\nabused by Youth B. She stated Youth A, Youth B and Youth C\nwere in the pod with her and she was the only staff present. Staff\n1 was sitting at a table with Youth C playing a card game and\n3",
    "Youth A and Youth B were standing near the doorway of Youth\nB’s bedroom. Staff 1 believed Youth A and Youth B were getting\nalong well at that time, recalling Youth A lightly tossing a plastic\ncup at Youth B and Youth B laughing. Staff 1 recalled Youth A\nand Youth B whispering about something at that time, and Staff 1\ncalled out to them to move away from each other so they could\nnot whisper anything that she could not hear. Staff 1 did not\nbelieve Youth A and Youth B interacted much after she gave them\nthat directive. Staff 1 noted there was likely no documentation of\nwhat occurred because it was not enough activity to even be\nnoted in shift logs. Staff 1 denied seeing Youth A and Youth B\nparticipate in any sexual activity. She also denied ever not having\nline of sight of Youth A and Youth B as they were near Youth B’s\nbedroom briefly and the door to the bedroom was not closed\nenough to limit the line of sight of them. Staff 1 also recalled\nYouth A coming to her a couple of days later and apologizing to\nher, stating that he lied about the incident.\nYouth B was interviewed over the phone on 01/31/2025. Youth B\nexpressed awareness of the allegations because he was informed\nof a safety plan that had been put in place to limit the contact\nbetween Youth B and Youth A. Youth B denied he participated in\nany sexual activity with Youth A. Youth B stated he was standing\nnear the doorway of his bedroom interacting with Youth A. Youth\nB recalled Youth C sitting at a nearby table with Staff 1. Youth B\ndid not recall any other details about that instance, stating that\nnothing happened. Youth B stated he and Youth A were never\nbehind his doorway and there was no way Staff 1 would not have\nhad line of sight of he and Youth A because the door to his room\nwas open, he and Youth A never went in to his room and that they\nwere out in the open area of the pod together with Youth C and\nStaff 1.\nYouth C was interviewed over the phone on 01/31/2025. Youth C\nrecalled the day when this incident allegedly happened and stated\nhe was able to see Youth A and Youth B the entire time. Youth C\ndenied seeing Youth A and Youth B do anything of a sexual\nnature, and also stated he did not believe Youth A and Youth B\ntouched each other in any way. Youth C recalled Youth A and\nYouth B talking to each other near Youth B’s doorway to his\nbedroom while he was playing cards with Staff 1. Youth C did not\nbelieve anything of note occurred at that moment. Youth C\ncommented Youth A has made sexual remarks to him prior to and\nafter this incident occurred.\nVideo reviewed:\n4",
    "• Security camera footage was viewed during an\nunannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility on\n12/11/2024. This footage showed Youth A, Youth B, Youth\nC and Staff 1 inside of Pod D. All four individuals could be\nseen in the open area of the pod. Youth C and Staff 1 were\nplaying cards while Youth A and Youth B alternated\nbetween interacting with each other and not. Youth B’s\nbedroom door was open, but it appeared that it was open\nwide enough that Staff 1’s line of sight would not be\nimpacted. At no point during this footage was it seen that\nYouth A and Youth B participated in any physical contact,\nsexual or otherwise.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• An undated facility safety plan signed by Youth A and his\nTherapist was provided and reviewed. This documented\nefforts agreed upon to limit the interaction between Youth A\nand Youth B.\n• Additional facility safety planning was provided and\nreviewed. This documentation further outlined the facility’s\nefforts to separate Youth A and Youth B, including moving\nYouth B’s bedroom away from Youth A and efforts to\nensure that they sit away from each other during meal\ntimes and in the classroom.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews, documentation and video reviewed Staff 1 provided\nproper supervision to Youth A and Youth B during the alleged\nincident.\nCONSULTATION:\nConsultation was offered to advised staff to ensure documentation\nsuch as safety plans are clearly dated and it is noted who they are\nauthored by to ensure that they can be organized and\ncommunicated effectively.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n02/20/2025\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 20, 2025\n___________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
