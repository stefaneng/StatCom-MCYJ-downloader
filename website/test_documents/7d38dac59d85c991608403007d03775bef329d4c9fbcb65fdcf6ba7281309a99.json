Per\nComplainant Youth A stated he was sitting on the couch at the\nhome when Staff 2 arrived, in a bad mood. Staff 2 was hostile to\nthe clients and told Youth A to “go the f*** upstairs” when he was\nnot doing anything wrong. Staff 2 verbally escalated the situation\nand began storming in and out of the house through the front\ndoor. Youth A then locked the door behind (Staff 2), to prevent her\nre-entry into the house. A male manager then arrived at the house\nand sent Staff 2 home.\nYouth A was interviewed in person by MDHHS courtesy worker on\n1/31/2023, as Youth A moved out of the area prior to the\nallegation being reported. Youth A is a juvenile justice, non-foster\ncare youth. Youth A has since moved two additional times and is\nbelieved to be residing in an unknown hotel with his custodial\nparent. During the MDHHS interview, Youth A reported Staff 2\nwould curse at the youth and violate their privacy by walking into\nthe bathroom during showers. Youth A would not elaborate on this\ninformation. Youth A spent the remainder of the interview\ndiscussing Staff 1. Youth A felt that Staff 2 told Staff 1 about the\nincident on 1/22/2023. Therefore, Staff 1 retaliated against Youth\nA on 1/23/23. The alleged retaliation was investigated by DCWL,\nSIR 2023C0000208.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 2/7/2023, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker.

Youth B\nthen went to his bedroom. Youth A continued arguing and yelling.\nStaff 2’s voice was loud, and could be heard over Youth A, but\nStaff 2 was not threatening or aggressive. Youth B was unsure if\nStaff 2 was swearing. After a few minutes Youth B no longer\nheard yelling. Shortly after, Chief Administrator was at the house\nand Staff 2 was gone.
