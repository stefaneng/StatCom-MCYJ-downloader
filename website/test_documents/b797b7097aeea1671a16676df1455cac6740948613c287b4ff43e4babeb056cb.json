    "PREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported the rate increase for staffing has really helped\nwith retention and hiring. CA noted calming plans for youth have improved\nbecause staff members are putting more effort and thought into the plans, which\nmakes the plans more individualized. One continued area of concern for the facility\nis access to comprehensive dental treatment for youth who require sedation as it\nhas been an ongoing barrier. Although all youth are currently up to date with their\ndental appointments, there have been historical late appointments for youth who\nrequire sedation to achieve dental cleanings at 6 and 12-month timeframes. During\nthe period of review, CA identified one unplanned discharge for a youth who\nrequired hospitalization due to decompensation of behaviors. CA expressed some\nconcerns and frustrations with the upcoming MDHHS contract revisions.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nEmployee interviews were conducted. They all reported there is excellent support\namongst staff, leadership, and upper management. They all reported loving their\njobs and working with the kids. They reported leadership and upper management\nare open to suggestions, feedback, and requests, so it creates an environment\nwith open communication and transparency. They reported concerns brought to\nupper management's attention are addressed quickly, which is encouraging for\nstaff. They reported training is effective and they feel there is enough relevant\ntraining to complete their job duties. They reported any changes in policy,\nprocedures, staffing, etc. are communicated quickly and effectively.\nThe youth interviewed did not have any concerns with the facility. They reported\nthe staff treat them well, they feel safe, they like the food, and they have enough\nfood.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility was completed on 3/19/24 and there were no safety\nconcerns noted.",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes. It is recommended that the agency be issued a renewal of their regular\nlicense.\nMarch 25, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 26, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
