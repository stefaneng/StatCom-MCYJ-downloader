Youth A\ndescribed his current injury to the back of his head, stating that he\nhad been struck by another youth about a week prior. This\nresulted in getting staples to address the wound. Since that time,\nhe admitted to picking at the wound, causing it to open up and\nbleed on occasions. Youth A described the incident in\nquestion. He reported being in a classroom with Staff 1, Staff 2,\nStaff 3 and Supervisor 1. He was in the classroom with these staff\nbecause they were attempting to help him calm down.
