    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(b) The services provided to residents and parents directly by\nthe institution and the services provided by outside\nresources.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The program is licensed to serve youth between the ages of 13-17\nyears of age but has stated that they are unable to meet the\neducational requirements for youth of middle school ages.\nInvestigation The Complainant was interviewed over the phone on 05/09/2024\nand had no other information to provide.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed on 05/20/2024 over the\nphone. After researching their agreement with the service\nprovider, Success Virtual Academy, that provides educational\nservices to the program, he confirmed the arrangement is not able\nto offer schooling to youth prior to high school grades. The Chief\nAdministrator confirmed the facility had recently declined\nplacement of a 13 year old youth in part due to the facility not\nbeing able to offer educational services. He stated the facility has\nbeen discussing steps needed to allow for the current educational\nprogramming to expand to younger youth but that would not be\nlikely soon because of the requirements needed of the service\nprovider. The Chief Administrator also recognized the current\nlicense terms include an age range of youth starting at 13 years\nold.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Email communication regarding the possible placement of\nthe youth referenced above was received. On 05/07/2024\nthe Chief Administrator stated to DHHS Staff 1 the\nplacement of the youth in the facility could not occur\nbecause their “education partners do not cater to middle\nschool youth currently and achieving accreditation to serve\nthis demographic is still a year away.”\n• Documentation from the educational service provider for\nthe facility, Success Virtual Academy, was provided on\n2",
    "05/28/2024. Their website stated they serve youth in grade\n9 or higher and from the ages of 14-21.\n• An excerpt from a Memo of Understanding between the\nfacility and the educational service provider was provided\nby the Chief Administrator on 05/30/2024. There were no\ndetails in this documentation regarding what grade level of\nyouth can be served.\n• The Program Statement for the facility was reviewed. This\nreferred to the program serving male youth between the\nages of 13-20. A description of educational programming\nwas included and indicated education services will be\nprovided to youth but did not reference specific grade levels\nthat could be serviced.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as their program\nstatement and available services did not match the educational\nservices they were able to offer a youth within their licensing\nterms.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n06/14/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n06/18/2024\n_________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n3"
