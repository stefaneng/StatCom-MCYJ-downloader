Youth A will pull on their ears to hear better.\nThe facility has been recommended to seek medical care, but it is\nunknown if they have done so.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the school on 1/31/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth A had a\nstuffy/runny nose, his right eye was a little red, and he sat fine on\nthe chair without showing any signs of pain. Youth A reported he\nhas allergies often, so he gets a stuffy nose a lot. Youth A\nreported he feels fine and doesn’t feel sick. Youth A reported he\nhasn’t been to the doctor recently and could not remember the\ndate of his last doctor’s appointment. Youth A reported his ears,\neyes, butt, and entire body felt fine. Youth A reported he was not\nfeeling any pain anywhere and did not have any complaints or\nconcerns. Youth A reported a long time ago he had a bump on his\nbutt, and it hurt bad, but it’s been gone for a while. Youth A\nreported when it happened, staff took him to the doctor. Youth A\nreported sometimes when he has a bowel movement it hurts, and\nit stretches his skin too much. Youth A reported he went to the\ndoctor for this when his butt bled one time, and the doctor\nreported he ripped some tissue. Youth A reported he always\nreceives medicine from the doctor if there’s a problem, and staff at\nthe facility always give him his medicine.

Para-pro reported she is\nYouth A’s one-on-one Para-pro at school. Her opinion is Youth A\n2",
    "is being neglected in his current placement. Para-pro reported\nYouth A comes to school all the time looking like no one helps him\ntake care of his face (crusty boogers, sore on chin he picks all the\ntime, ears always full of wax). Para-pro reported Youth A’s\nappearance isn’t one of someone who is being taken care of\nproperly. Para-pro reported Youth A pulls his ears down all the\ntime because he can’t hear well. Para-pro reported Youth A has\nhearing aids so she thinks he can’t hear well because of the\namount of wax in his ears. Para-pro reported Youth A was sent\nhome yesterday because he had blood coming out of his eye.\nPara-pro reported Youth A complains his butt hurts all the time, so\nthey have extra cushions for him to sit on and he has to walk\naround frequently because it hurts to sit. Para-pro reported she is\nnot sure if the pain on his butt is from a medical situation or a\nresult of abuse, but it’s been a concern the entire school year thus\nfar. Para-pro then reported Youth A has not complained about\npain in his butt since before Christmas break. Para-pro reported\nYouth A will always complain he’s hungry. Para-pro reported she’s\nrepeatedly asked the facility to take Youth A to the doctor. Para-\npro admitted she’s never followed up with the facility to ask if they\ntook Youth A to the doctor or the outcome of any doctor’s visits.\nPara-pro admitted she is not familiar with his medical diagnoses or\ngenetic condition and isn’t sure what the chronic symptoms or\ntreatments of his diagnoses or condition are. Para-pro reported\nshe knows the information is on file with the school somewhere.\nSecretary was interviewed face to face at the school on\n1/31/25 in coordination with MDHHS Worker. Secretary\nreported she is the lead secretary at Youth A’s school. Secretary\nreported the concerns listed in the allegations are valid. Secretary\nreported Youth A has a hearing impairment and his ears are\nfrequently dirty. Secretary reported Youth A has been complaining\nabout his butt hurting for months. Secretary reported a few months\nago, Youth A told her he “had a hold in his butt” and she assumed\nthat must mean he had hemorrhoids. Secretary reported Youth A\nthen complained his butt was bleeding, and she assumed he must\nhave been constipated or straining too much when having a bowel\nmovement. Secretary reported she thinks the last time he\ncomplained about any pain on his butt was before Christmas.\nSecretary reported Youth A went home yesterday because his eye\nwas bleeding. Secretary reported she knows he has a medical\ncondition but was not sure if the issue with his eye was related or\nnot. Secretary reported Youth A has called home more often this\nyear compared to last year, and she cannot tell if he’s always\nhaving ailments or if he is having a harder time with his\nschoolwork this year. Secretary reported she’s talked to the facility\n3",
    "about taking Youth A to the doctor to address his ailments.\nSecretary admitted she’s never asked the facility about any\nmedical appointments he’s gone to or followed-up to find out what\ntreatment he receives. Secretary reported Case Manager is\namazing with Youth A and seems to care about him a lot.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 1/31/25 in coordination with MDHHS Worker. CA\nreported when the school called yesterday to report Youth A had\nblood in his eye, Case Manager heard Youth A yelling in the\nbackground saying, “there’s not blood in my eye!”. CA reported\nwhen Youth A got home that day, he did not have any blood in his\neye, but his eye was red. CA reported Youth A’s eye drops and\neye creams are applied daily due to his chronic eye problems\nbecause of his Kaufman’s syndrome diagnosis. CA reported\nYouth A has frequent build-up of fluid and wax in his ears because\nof Kaufman’s syndrome and requires an irrigation system to clean\nhis ears. CA reported sometimes the irrigation system doesn’t get\nit all, or it builds up quicker during the day when they can’t irrigate\nhis ears because he’s at school. CA reported Youth A’s ears\ncannot be cleaned with a Q-tip because he has very tight ear\ncanals. CA reported Youth A’s doctor instructed them to bring\nYouth A to the doctor if the wax build-up gets to be too much or\ncauses him pain. CA reported Youth A is good about telling them\nwhen he’s in pain or something else is going on with his body, and\nhe hasn’t complained about his ears at all. CA reported Youth A\nwent to the doctor a few months ago because he tore some tissue\nwhen he had a hard bowel movement. CA reported Youth A was\nprescribed some ointment and it healed. CA reported all of the\nconcerns mentioned in the allegations either haven’t happened\n(ear odor and blood from his eye), were addressed by the doctor\nas soon as they occurred (pain in buttocks and pain when using\nthe bathroom), or are because of his diagnosis of Kaufman’s\nsyndrome (consistent phlegmy cough, eye issues, ear wax build-\nup, hearing aids).\nLicensee Designee (LD) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 1/31/25 in coordination with MDHHS Worker. LD\nreported Youth A sees an ENT through UofM. LD reported Youth\nA is good about telling staff if he’s in pain, has a complaint about\nhis health, or needs anything. LD reported Youth A hugs her all\nthe time which puts her close to his ears, and she’s never noticed\nan odor.\nCase Manager (CM) was interviewed via phone on 2/27/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. CM reported she has been\n4",
    "Youth A’s case manager since January 2024, and she is\nresponsible for managing most of his appointments. CM reported\nif Youth A complains of any pain or if there are any noticeable\nailments or illnesses, CM is responsible for scheduling the\nappointment and taking Youth A to address it. CM reported\nsometimes it takes a day for a doctor’s appointment to be\nscheduled with the primary care physician, so if it’s an urgent\nconcern she will take Youth A to urgent care. CM reported the\npain on Youth A’s buttocks was due to two different issues. One of\nthe issues was Youth A had a boil on his butt cheek, which\ncaused him pain when sitting, so he had a cushion to sit on at\nschool. CM reported Youth A was prescribed medication for the\nboil and had a follow-up appointment to address it. CM reported\nthe other issue was when he tore some tissue due to having a\nhard bowel movement. CM reported Youth A was prescribed\nointment, and it healed without follow-up. CM reported Youth A is\ndiagnosed with Kaufman’s syndrome, and eye crust, nose\ncrust/boogers, and ear fluid/wax build-up are some chronic\nsymptoms of his condition. CM reported sometimes the ear\nfluid/wax builds up more during the school day because the\nvinegar irrigation staff at the facility can do, cannot be done at the\nschool. CM reported the school nurse has all the information\nregarding Youth A’s condition, medications, etc. on file. CM\nreported she has never noticed an odor coming from Youth A’s\near before. CM reported Youth A has never had blood coming\nfrom his eye. CM reported when she got a call from the school\nyesterday stating Youth A was bleeding from his eye, she heard\nYouth A yelling in the background that his eye was just red, and it\nwas not bleeding. CM reported when she got to the school to pick\nYouth A up, his eye was only red and was not bleeding. CM\nreported she took Youth A back to the facility, wiped his eyes with\na warm washcloth, applied the ointment and drops, and then\nYouth A was fine. CM reported the only time Youth A has ever\ncomplained about any hearing issues is when his hearing aid\nbatteries are dying, but he is quick to let staff know so they can\nchange the batteries. CM reported the school also has an extra\nset of batteries in case the batteries are low during school hours.\nCM reported she has never seen Youth A pull on his ears. CM\nreported she checks Youth A’s ears daily to see if there is too\nmuch build-up, and if there is, she will do the irrigation. CM\nreported Youth A is really good about letting staff know if he is in\npain or uncomfortable, so they’re able to address any issues\nquickly.\n5",
