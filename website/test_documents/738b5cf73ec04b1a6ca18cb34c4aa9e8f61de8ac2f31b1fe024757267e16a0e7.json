CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nDuring the course of the inspection, it was discovered that there was confusion\nabout the files for which DCWL provides regulation. It was discussed that DCWL\nonly reviews files of youth who are being served by the CPA license, CB390267474\nfor the purpose of this review. This includes all DHHS contracted cases and non-\ncontracted cases (foster care and adoption) served by a DCWL licensed programs.\nPrograms that operate solely under federal contracts or other DCWL licenses (CCI\nor other licensed/contracted offices) are not to be included in the review of this\n11",
    "license. If a program holds multiple contracts, only the requirements of the DHHS\ncontract will be reviewed by DCWL.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nI reviewed all aspects of this investigation and determined that it was completed\nthoroughly and accurately.\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first approved CAP was in response to SIR 2021C0212002 in which the agency\nwas cited for violating rule 400.12303(2)(M) for not following agency policy regarding\na youth’s personal possessions. The agency has maintained compliance with the\nCAP which was approved on 12/21/2021.\nThe second approved CAP was in response to the licensing renewal inspection\nreport. The agency has not maintained compliance with that CAP as evidenced by\nthe number of repeat violations discovered during this inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment identified several areas of non-compliance\nconfirmed during this inspection. Those areas were attributed to low staffing, high\nturnover rates, and pandemic related restrictions. I identified several additional areas\nof non-compliance which were not identified in the assessment which I discussed with\nthe chief administrator.\nInterviews\nAll of the staff interviewed reported being satisfied with the level of supervision and\nsupport they receive. Despite low staffing and rapid staff turnover, the workers all\nreport maintaining manageable caseloads.\nVII. DCWL ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns were identified.\n12",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\nFebruary 3, 2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 4, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n13"
