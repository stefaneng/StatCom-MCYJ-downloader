The form on which the information is typically documented\n(DHS-3307) was present in the file but the majority of fields did not contain\ninformation.\nCPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n• (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or\nparents and the foster parents in the\ndevelopment of service plans to enable the\nparent or parents and foster parents to\nunderstand the plan for the child and the\nparents' and the foster parent's role in assisting\nthe agency in carrying out the plan.

    "Two of Six open files of youth in foster care placement reviewed did not contain\ndocumentation that all monthly visits with youths and foster parents were\ncompleted as required. One case was missing a visit within the month the youth\nwas removed from the home. One file contained visits in the foster home with the\nyouth for three consecutive months; however the worker did not visit with the\nfoster parents.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Technical Assistance was provided regarding the wording in one special\nevaluation report regarding a pool not having sufficient barriers as explanation\nwas needed as to what was meant by the pool not being in use. Be sure to\ninclude details if a pool without proper barriers is emptied and cannot be\naccessed.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• No consultation was requested or required.",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The one\nCAP submitted by the agency during the period under review was submitted in\nresponse to the 2024 licensing inspection report dated 9/18/2024. That CAP was\napproved on 10/10/2024 and addressed eleven violations; two of which were\npolicy violations no longer regulated by DCWL. Of the remaining nine violations\naddressed in that CAP, seven were related to borrowed bed requirements, all of\nwhich were repeated during this investigation and require assessment and\nadditional corrective action planning. The two violations addressed in that CAP not\nrepeated during this inspection were related to foster home special evaluation\nrequirements.\nDuring the period under review the Child Placing Agency license was closed for\nthe Clinton County office and that office became a satellite to the Eaton County\noffice. This has some impact on the comparison between the 2024 and 2025\ninspections as the 2024 inspection and CAP for the Clinton County files are not\nrepresented.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment dated 6/23/2025 was reviewed and discussed\nduring the entrance meeting. The chief administrator identified the largest barrier\nto adhering to statute, administrative rules, ISEP, and policy during the past year\nhas been the placement crisis for older and more difficult to place youth. She\nindicates the exhaustive placement efforts are time consuming and negatively\nimpact a worker's ability to complete other required tasks timely. Additionally, the\nchief administrator indicated the required tasks and responsibilities continue to\nincrease while caseloads are not reduced resulting in difficulty maintaining\ncompliance with all requirements. The chief administrator documented frustration\nwith the licensing standard of 100% compliance as that expectation does not\naccount for situations outside of a worker's control while other department\nprograms are held to a 95% compliance standard by their regulatory bodies. The\nchief administrator reported the 2024 corrective action plan was largely effective\nand tasks put into place of helped maintain compliance as well as to identify\nbarriers resulting in problem solving discussions.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A",
    "Staff Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed reported enjoying working for the county offices\nstating they get good support from management. They stated they participate in\nweekly meetings during which any changes/updates to case management\nexpectations are reviewed. The staff members reported their caseloads are\nmanageable overall and stated there is always someone at the agency willing to\nhelp, when needed. The staff members did not report any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office has adequate space and equipment for the delivery of foster\ncare, independent living, and certification services. Physical CHRI is stored\nsecurely within locked drawers in a licensing worker's cubicle and multiple cross\nshredders are in the office. Closed adoption files are locked in cabinets which are\nlocated in the main office.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJune 26, 2025\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 27, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
