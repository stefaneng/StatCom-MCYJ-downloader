    "Youth A’s medical documentation states Youth A was seen by\nnursing staff on 07/28/2025 because he was hit on the right side\nof his head and the back of his head and neck. Youth A’s pupils\nwere equal and round and responsive to light and he was alert\nand oriented. Youth A stated he vomited twice and complained of\nheadache but denied loss of consciousness. Youth A was sent to\nChildren’s Hospital of Michigan on 07/28/2025 to rule out a\nconcussion. Children’s Hospital of Michigan diagnosed Youth A\nwith a closed head injury (concussion). Youth A was seen by\nnursing staff on 07/29/2025 for follow up. Youth A was alert and\noriented with a steady gait.\nYouth B’s medical documentation states Youth B was seen by\nnursing staff on 07/28/2025. Youth B had a scratch on his right\nshoulder, lip, and left side of his face without bleeding, swelling, or\npain. Youth B’s scratch marks were cleaned and bacitracin was\napplied.\nWayne County Juvenile Detention is approved to utilize Handle\nwith Care physical management model.\nUnit Layout\nUnit 3A is shaped like the letter H. Youth bedrooms, showers and\noffice space surround the common area in the vertical lines of the\nletter H. In the horizontal line of the letter H is the unit gym and\nacross from the gym is a staff desk area. The unit classroom is\nlocated behind the staff desk.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance because CRT 1 admits to\nhitting Youth A’s head on 07/28/2025. This is supported through\nseveral interviews, CRT 1’s incident report and video footage. It\ncannot be determined if the scratch marks on Youth B were from\nhis altercation with Youth D or from his physical management with\nCRT 4.\nTechnical Assistance\nPhysical management policy and procedure is to state that any\ntype of physical punishment including, but not limited to: hitting or\nstriking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a youth on any part\nof their body is prohibited.\nConclusion REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2024SIC0001771 approved 11/27/2024\n• Corrective action plan approved 01/16/2025\n2024SIC0001796 approved 02/13/2025\n• Corrective action plan approved 03/03/2025\n7",
