On 1/31/23, I met her face-to-face at Youth J’s\nschool. Complainant expressed no additional concerns regarding\nAdrian Group Home.\n2",
    "On 1/30/23, I notified Youth J’s foster care worker of this investigation\nassignment. On 2/6/23, I participated in a conference call arranged by\nthe Placement Coordination Unit (PCU) with the foster care worker in\nattendance.\nYouth J was admitted to Adrian Group Home on 7/18/22. I interviewed\nYouth J at school on 1/31/23. He was wearing eyeglasses. The right\narm of the frame was broken off. A string from the right side of the\nframe to the left arm holds the glasses in place. The nosepiece and\nlenses are intact.\nYouth J said his foster care worker is aware of the broken frames. He\nsaid he accidently broke them at school, but he could not remember\nwhen he broke them. He got his current pair of glasses with his mother\nwhen he lived with her prior to coming into care. He said he does not\nknow if or when he has an eye appointment scheduled.\nI notified Director of Operations (DO) of the allegation and interviewed\nher face-to-face at the facility on 1/31/23. DO said Youth J’s frames\nbroke in mid-December 2022 and explained, “We’ve been trying to\nreplace his glasses. Foster Care Worker did not have a prescription so\nwe could not use that to replace the frames.” Prior to breaking them,\nshe said Youth J already had an initial eye examination scheduled for\n12/27/22 at SVS Vision in Adrian, but SVS Vision rescheduled that\nappointment due to flooding in their building. DO said his new\nappointment is on 3/4/23.\nDO said the facility nurse searched all of the eye doctors for ones who\naccepted Medicaid and SVS Vision was the only provider in the area. If\nfor some reason Youth J is ineligible for an eye examination, lenses,\nand frames, I asked DO who would pay for these. DO said if Medicaid\ndoes not pay, Adrian Group Home will.\nAnalysis Youth J accidentally broke the arm of his eyeglass frames between the\nend of November and mid-December 2022. The facility scheduled an\neye appointment for 12/27/22. Due to a flood, the provider cancelled\nYouth J’s appointment and rescheduled it for 3/4/23.\nCONSULTATION\nI emailed Chief Administrator (CA) and asked her to contact SVS Vision\nto see if they have a cancellation so Youth J can be seen sooner. CA\nresponded on 2/2/23 stating they did have a cancellation and can see\nYouth J on 2/7/23. I also asked CA to inform Youth J so he knows he\nwill be getting a new pair of glasses soon.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy.\nIt is recommended that the current license status be continued.\nFebruary 6, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 14, 2023\n____________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
