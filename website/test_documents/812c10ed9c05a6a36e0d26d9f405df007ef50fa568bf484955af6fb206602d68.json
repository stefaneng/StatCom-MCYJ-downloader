    "II. ALLEGATION(S)\nViolation\nEstablished?\nShelter residents placed in detention upon return from AWOL Yes\nAdditional Findings No\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n10/19/2020 Special Investigation Intake\n2021C0219007\n10/19/2020 Special Investigation Initiated - Telephone\n10/19/2020 Contact - Document Received\n11/25/2020 Exit conference.\nALLEGATION: Shelter residents placed in detention upon return from AWOL\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed facility email dated 10/19/2020. It summarizes the phone call between\nthis writer and Facility Manager 1 dated the same date. It states two female neglect\nwards placed in the facility’s shelter licensed program AWOL’d at approximately\n08:40pm the evening of 10/16/2020. Police were contacted and Resident’s A and B\nwere brought back to the facility at approximately 11:00pm the same evening.\nResident A and B were very nonchalant and did not give any answers for why they\nran. Resident A continued to state, “I don’t want to be here” and began dancing,\nwhereas Resident B laughing at everything supervisors said. Resident’s A and B\nwere defiant and did not agree to make a commitment to not truant from the\nprogram. Facility Manager 2 was contacted, and it was determined that Residents A\nand B would sleep in the separately licensed detention program for the night due to\nconcerns for their safety and possibility of truanting again. It was determined that\nResidents A and B would quarantine and be assessed in the morning to be\ntransitioned back into their originally placed and separately licensed shelter program.\nResidents A and B entered the detention program at approximately 11:45pm and\nreturned to the shelter program at 09:15am.\nI reviewed the State of Michigan Child Caring Institute database system. It states\nthe following licensing terms:\nCE630201059 is licensed for short-term and treatment residents,\n2",
    "without behavior management rooms. This license is noted\nas being the facility’s shelter placement program.\nCE630201058 is licensed for short-term, with behavior management\nrooms. This license is noted as being the facility’s secure\ndetention program.\nIt is noted that the referral for this special investigation was self-reported by the\nfacility.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nANALYSIS: Resident’s A and B were initially placed in the facility’s licensed\nshelter program for non-adjudicated youth. Resident’s A and B\nwere consequently housed in the facility’s separately licensed\nsecure delinquent program for adjudicated youth for 9 ½ hours,\nupon their return from AWOL, due to risk from further truancy.\nSuch placement is not consistent with its policies and\nprocedures pertaining to its admissions and care given the\nresidents required level of care at time of referral.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an approved corrective action plan no change to the current license\nis recommended.\n11/06/2020\n________________________________________\nChristopher Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 20, 2020\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
