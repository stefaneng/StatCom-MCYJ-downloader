    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Change of placement\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12405\nSection • (3) The agency shall document all the following in the\nDescription child's record before a change of placement occurs:\n• (d) Consideration of the factors identified in R\n400.12404(4).\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster parent put in their notice for child to be moved. There is a\nlicensed foster parent in the area who was an ideal fit. She knew\nthe child, understood and could meet her physical and mental\nhealth needs, had expressed interest in placement, and the child\nbegged to be placed with her. The Associate Director of agency\nrejected the idea multiple times, insisting that the child be moved\nacross the state to a different home, taking the child away from\nher school, her therapist, and her support team in the area. After\nbeing asked by the GAL, the adoption worker, the DHHS worker,\nand the agency’s caseworker what the concerns were for the\nhome, the agency director failed to respond to anyone.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on 1/7/2025. She\nreported Youth A needed placement in July of 2024 after Foster\nParent 1 asked for Youth A to be moved. Foster Parent 3, who is\nlicensed through a local DHHS office, knew Youth A as Foster\nParent 3 used to work at Holy Cross Services – Northern\nMichigan. Foster Care Worker reached out to Foster Parent 3 for\npossible placement of Youth A at which time Foster Parent 3\nexpressed interest in taking placement of Youth A. When Foster\nCare Worker approached Former Director with this option, Former\nDirector told her no, so Youth A was placed with Foster Parent 2,\na local foster home licensed through Holy Cross Servies –\nNorthern Michigan. Foster Parent 2 put in notice to have Youth A\nmoved in November of 2024. Foster Parent 3 had been providing\nrespite care for Youth A while she was placed with Foster Parent\n2, so Foster Parent 3 was aware of the move request. Foster\nParent 3 expressed to Foster Care Worker she would like Youth A\nplaced in her home. Youth A also expressed to Foster Care\nWorker she would like to live with Foster Parent 3. Foster Care\nWorker reported Former Director again told her “no” to placement\n2",
    "with Foster Parent 3 after which a foster home on the other side of\nthe state was identified for Youth A. Foster Care Worker stated\nshe went to Youth A’s Guardian Ad Litem, and adoption worker\nwith her concerns that a home across the state was located for\nYouth A rather than placing Youth A with Foster Parent 3. An\nemail thread with all of the above-mentioned individuals as well as\nFormer Director included a question to Former Director as to what\nher concerns were with placing Youth A with Foster Parent 3.\nFoster Care Worker stated Former Director gave them “the cold\nshoulder” and did not respond to the email. Since Former Director\ndid not respond, Foster Care Worker made the decision to Place\nYouth A with Foster Parent 3. Foster Care Worker stated this\noccurred quickly as it was only a few days after Foster Parent 2\nrequested the replacement that Youth A was placed with Foster\nParent 3. Foster Care Worker stated Foster Parent 3 has signed\nan intent to adopt Youth A, so Foster Care Worker feels there was\na delay in permanency for Youth A as she could have been placed\nwith Foster Parent A back in July, but she was not due to Former\nDirector not supporting placement with Foster Parent 3 for\n“personal reasons.” Foster Care Worker added that Foster Parent\n3 stated she thinks there is “personal drama” with Former Director.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed by video conferencing\non 1/10/2025. Foster Care Worker stated when replacement of\nYouth A was needed in July of 2024, she needed to be replaced\nthe same day due to allegations made against Foster Parent 1 by\nYouth A. Foster Parent 3 reached out expressing interest in\nplacement of Youth A; however, Youth A was already placed with\nFoster Parent 2, a local family interested in adopting Youth A, so\nthere was no reason to consider moving her. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated placement with Foster Parent 3 wouldn’t have\nbeen an option at that time anyway as there was no time to get\nborrowed bed paperwork completed and Foster Parent 3 had\nplacement of two teen boys, so placement of Youth A in her home\nwould not have been appropriate.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated Foster Parent 3 provided respite\ncare for Youth A while she was placed with Foster Parent 2, so\nwhen replacement was needed for Youth A in November of 2024,\nYouth A expressed wanting to be placed with Foster Parent 3.\nFormer Director said she didn’t think it was a good idea as Foster\nParent 3 is a former agency employee and there may be a\npotential conflict of interest. Youth A reached out to her adoption\nworker requesting placement with Foster Parent 3 after which\nYouth A’s Guardian Ad Litem sent emails about the placement to\nwhich Former Director did not respond. Foster Care Supervisor\n3",
    "stated Youth A was subsequently placed with Foster Parent 3.\nFoster Care Supervisor reported Former Director did not talk to\nher much about this situation which Foster Care Supervisor\nbelieves is because Foster Care Supervisor is friends with Foster\nParent 3. She stated it was 2-3 days at most from the time Foster\nParent 2 requested Youth A be moved to the time Youth A was\nplaced with Foster Parent 3. She stated there was no delay in\npermanency for Youth A and placement criteria were considered\nand met.\nFormer Director was interviewed by phone on 1/9/20254. She\nstated she didn’t remember telling Foster Care Worker she could\nnot place Youth A with Foster Parent 3 in July of 2024. She stated\nshe does remember she didn’t know if placement with Foster\nParent 3 was a good idea due to Foster Parent 3 being young as\nwell as Foster Parent 3 having teen boys placed in her home.\nFormer Director stated the family with whom Youth A was placed\nat that time, Foster Parent 2, was a pre-adoptive home. When\nreplacement was again needed for Youth A in November of 2024,\nFormer Director wasn’t very involved. Former Director stated she\nreceived the group email in which she was asked for an opinion\nregarding placement with Foster Parent 3 in November, but\nFormer Director chose not to respond because she does have\npersonal feeling about placing with Foster Parent 3 and did not\nfeel it appropriate to get involved. Former Director stated she did\nnot know if Foster Parent 3 was interested in adopting Youth A.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nThe following documentation was reviewed in Youth A’s case\nrecord:\n• Youth A’s placement record:\no 5/6/2024 – 7/29/2024 Foster Parent 1\no 7/29/2024 – 11/13/2024 Foster Parent 2\no 11/13/2024 – Foster Parent 3\n• Action Summaries (DHS-69)\no For 7/29/24 placement indicating move from Foster\nParent 1 to Foster Parent 2 due to Foster Parent 1’s\nrequest to move Youth A. The following placement\ncriteria were scored as most important when\nselecting Foster Parent 2:\n▪ The case plan which includes goal of\npermanence\n▪ Physical emotional, and safety needs of child\n▪ Least restrictive, most family like setting\n▪ Continuity of relationships\n4",
    "▪ Availability of placement resources for timely\nplacement\n• Action Summaries (DHS-69)\no For 11/23/2024 placement indicating move from\nFoster Parent 2 to Foster Parent 3 due to Foster\nParent 2’s request to move Youth A. The following\nplacement criteria were scored as most important\nwhen selecting Foster Parent 3:\n▪ The case plan which includes goal of\npermanence\n▪ Physical emotional, and safety needs of child\n▪ Least restrictive, most family like setting\n▪ Continuity of relationships\n▪ Availability of placement resources for timely\nplacement\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as consideration of the factors\nidentified in R 400.12404(4) were documented in Youth A’s\nrecord.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJanuary 13, 2025\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 14, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
