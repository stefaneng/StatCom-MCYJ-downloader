    "ALLEGATION:\nIt was alleged Former Resident A was locked in a room for hours in a facility with\nno behavior management room.\nINVESTIGATION:\nFormer Resident A, age 14, is an abuse/neglect ward who resided in Dolores Hall from\n9/29/17 – 12/9/19. She was discharged to her adoptive mother’s home and currently\nreceives aftercare services from Vista Maria.\nOn 3/10/20, I interviewed Former Resident A by phone regarding the allegation. The\ninterview was not private. Before the call ended, the adoptive mother notified me that\nshe had been listening on speaker phone.\nFormer Resident A said she was locked in a BMR multiple times and was left in there\nfor hours while staff slept. Although she resided in Dolores Hall, she said she was\nsometimes secluded in the behavior management room (BMR) in Beata Hall. Commented [WD(1]:\nIt should be noted Former Resident A’s stay at Vista Maria spanned a 26-month time\nperiod. I asked if she recalled any specific seclusion or the staff involved. Former\nResident A did not identify any specific incident. However, she began screaming at me\nabout “staff” in general calling them “idiots and liars.” She was loud, hyperverbal,\naccusatory and aggressive. I had difficulty deciphering her words and understanding\nher meaning. She screamed at me for 30 minutes and refused to listen to my\nquestions.\nFormer Resident A insisted that the seclusions were not justified by her behavior and\nany incident reports I gathered would be falsified by “staff.” I asked her if she ever filed\na grievance or shared her concerns with the people at Vista. She said she filed several\ngrievances and made numerous complaints to supervisors, the unit manager, her\nformer DHHS worker, the police and the courts, but nothing changed.\nWhen she finally stopped screaming, I asked her what she thought should be done at\nVista Maria. Former Resident A expressed that residents in open programs should\nnever be secluded even if their behaviors warrant it. She said she’s done with Vista and\nnever wants to talk about Vista again. “Thank you, goodbye.” I thanked her for the\ninformation.\nI requested all paperwork documenting Former Resident A’s seclusions from 9/29/17 –\n12/9/19. Three incident reports dated 11/22/17, 9/22/18 and 12/9/18 were provided.\n 11/22/17 – Resident A was threatening staff and inciting mayhem on the wing.\nShe was secluded in the BMR at Beata Hall for 20 minutes.\n3",
    " 9/22/18 – Two other residents were acting out. Resident A was secluded in\nher room for 20 minutes.\n 12/9/18 – Resident A was physically assaultive toward peers and staff. She\nwas secluded in the BMR at Beata Hall for less than 15 minutes. The time in\nand time out were not documented.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4160 Seclusion rooms; department approval required.\n(1) Prior to establishing a seclusion room, an institution\nshall obtain written approval from the departments\nlicensing authority and the department of licensing and\nregulatory affairs, bureau of fire services.\nANALYSIS: The BMRs on Vista Maria’s campus are approved by DCWL\nand the Fire Inspector. Bedrooms in some buildings are\ncapable of locking and can be used for seclusion if necessary.\nThe licensing rules do not prohibit secluding a resident from an\nopen program in another building’s BMR if her behavior\nwarrants it.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4161 Seclusion rooms; policies and procedures.\nAn institution approved to use a seclusion room shall\nestablish and follow written policies and procedures\nspecifying its use. The policy shall include, at a minimum,\nall of the following provisions:\n(b) The room may only be used if a resident is in danger\nof jeopardizing the safety and security of himself, herself,\nor others.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: On 9/22/18, an incident report indicates Resident A was\nsecluded in her room for 20 minutes when others were acting\nout. The room may only be used if a resident is jeopardizing the\nsafety of herself or others. Resident A was not jeopardizing the\nsafety of herself or others.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4162 Seclusion rooms; administrative oversight.\n(2) The chief administrator or chief administrator designee\nshall track all instances of the use of a seclusion room, the\nlength of each confinement, the frequency of individual\nresidents confined, the reason for the confinement, and the\nstaff person who initiated the confinement for the purpose\nof analyzing the effectiveness of the intervention for\ncontrolling behavior in the program.\nANALYSIS: On 12/9/18, the length of Resident A’s confinement in seclusion\nwas not documented.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nCONSULTATION\nThe purpose of an incident report is to document the facts of one unusual incident such\nas a restraint or seclusion. The precipitating event, staff involved and staff interventions\nshould also be included. Documenting several incidents/behaviors occurring over an\nextended period of time in one incident report is not recommended.\nFor seclusions, the time in and out of the locked room must be documented. (Refer to\nR 400.4162 Seclusion rooms, administrative oversight (2) length of confinement.)\nI reviewed the agency’s Seclusion policy and Behavior Management policy which\ndefines Segregation for Safety. Segregation for Safety is a term coined by Vista\nMaria to describe what happens when a dangerous situation develops and the staff\ncall out to “Clear the Area.”\nBoth the seclusion and behavior management policies are consistent with PA 116\nand the Child Welfare Licensing Rules. However, based on the incident reports\nreviewed, there seems to be confusion that a resident can be both Secluded and\nSegregated for Safety at the same time. Staff are labelling both Seclusion and\n5",
    "Segregation for Safety for the same youth in the drop-down screen on incident\nreports. In one incident report, a staff wrote the resident was “Secluded for Safety.”\nIn essence, the reason for all seclusions and segregations is for safety.\nResidents can be segregated in unlocked rooms or other areas for their own\nsafety. However, they cannot be secluded (locked in) due to the dangerous\nbehaviors of others. I strongly recommend the above information be clarified to\ndirect care and supervisory staff in all Vista Maria programs.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION:\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is submitted, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nMarch 13, 2020\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 17, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n6"
