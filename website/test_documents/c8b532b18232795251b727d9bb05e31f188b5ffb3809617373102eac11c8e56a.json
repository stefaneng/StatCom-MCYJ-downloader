    "On 4/4/2023 I interviewed, the Complainant, Guardian Ad Liem\n(GAL) X by telephone. GAL X indicated in the complaint that\nChild A presents with multiple physical issues including leg\ndragging, needing tongue surgery and multiple signs of autism.\nGAL X indicated that at a review court hearing on 1/23/2023 the\ncourt ordered the Oakland Family Services (OFS) agency to\nobtain a second opinion related to Child A’s medical issues prior\nto the next court date on 3/28/2023. GAL X reported that a few\ndays prior to the 3/28/2023 OFS reported it was relying on Early\nOn for the fulfillment of the assessment. GAL X reported the court\nfound that Early On services does not comply with the court’s\norder for a second opinion.\nGAL X reported she had concern with whether the OFS worker\nhad actually made an Early On services referal. GAL X said\nperhaps OFS had made the referral because the foster parents\nreported they were informed by OFS that Early On would come to\ntheir home in early March of 2023. By the end of March 2023\nEarly On had not come to the foster home, so services were likely\nnot provided to Child A with respect to her physical and mental\nhealth issues. GAL X reported Early On “is terrible anyway”, and\nChild A requires services related to her leg and tongue. GAL X\nadvised that Child A requires a complete assessment of the\naforementioned health care issues via a hospital provider like\nBeaumont Hospital. GAL X reported she is not certain of all the\nservices required for a child with Autism, but Child A needs to be\ndiagnosed. GAL X reported Child A has a sister who is diagnosed\nwith Autism, therefore the urgency to determine Child A’s needs.\nGAL X said Child A’ primary health care provider does not appear\nto be doing his job. Additionally, OFS is not following up on Child\nA needs in these areas. GAL X reported the OFS worker reported\nsomething about insurance issues affecting getting a second\nopinion; but OFS did not address the issues with the Department\nof Health and Human Services (DHHS) Purchase of Services\n(POS) Worker. GAL X reported the court indicated it does not\ncare about insurance issues; that Child A needs to get the second\nopinion.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 2 & Foster Care Supervisor 3\nOn April 6, 2023, I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) 2 and\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) 3, separately, at the OFS office. I\nalso had an email correspondence with FCS 3 on 4/27/2023.\nBoth of these OFS employees reported believing OFS had fulfilled\nthe court order requirement for a second opinion by FCW 2’s\ncompletion of an Early On assessment for Child A.\n3",
    "Foster Care Worker 2:\nFCW 2 reported being Child A’s case worker since Child A’s\nplacement with OFS/ Foster Parent B and Foster Parent C on\n1/7/2022. FCW 2 reported Child A is a 14-month-old toddler who\nis not diagnosed with any specialized needs at this time. As for\nChild A’s reported leg and tongue issues, FCW 3 reported Child A\nis tongue tied and the foster parents reported that Child A may be\ndragging one of her legs. FCW 2 reported Child A’s pediatrician,\nDoctor P has not recommended any type of correction for the tied\ntongue, at this time. The foster parents reported that Doctor P\ninformed them at Child A’s last well child exam on 1/6/2023 that it\nis unknown how Child A’s tongue-tied issue may affect Child A;\nthat Child A may eventually outgrow this. FCW 2 reported Doctor\nP documented the tongue-tied diagnosis in Child A’s well child\nreport, but the statements about its possible affects came from the\nfoster parents. Doctor P had not documented that in any well child\nexamination report.\nFCW 2 reported Child A’s foster parents had reported to the GAL\nthat Child A drags her right left, but they had not informed her of\nthis. FCW 2 was unaware of this issue until the GAL reported it at\nthe 1/23/2023 court hearing. FCW 2 spoke with the foster parents\nafterwards about Child A’s leg. The foster parents confirmed that\nthey thought Child A was dragging Child A’s leg. FCW 2 also\nobserved Child A. From what FCW 2 observed it appeared Child\nA was favoring one leg more than the other, not that Child A was\ndragging either leg. Nor that Child A appeared in pain. FCW 2 had\nnot received medical reports of a significant problem.\nFCW 2 reported it was at the 1/23/2023 court hearing that the\nmatter of a second opinion came up. The court did not just ask for\na second opinion. The GAL asked the court to order the second\nopinion. The January 2023 court ‘s order for a second opinion was\nonly related to Child A’s leg and speech. As for Child A’s speech\nFCW 2 reported according to Child A’s foster parents, Child A\nwould have fits of anger, which they believed came from Child A\nnot being able to communicate what Child A wants. Child A only\nhas a few words of vocabulary. In term of Autism, FCW 2 said the\nAutism issue did not come up until the March 2023 court hearing,\nwhen the GAL mentioned that Child A could have Autism because\nChild A’s five-year-old sister is diagnosed with Autism. FCW 2\nreported prior to the GAL mentioning the Autism concern at the\nMarch court hearing, FCW 2 had not noticed Child A displaying\nsigns of the disorder. Nor had the foster parents mentioned Child\nA displaying any signs. The foster parents had only reported that\n4",
    "sometimes Child A covers her ears at loud noises. The foster\nparents had not specified the type of loud noises. FCW 2 reported\nthe court did not specify in the March 2023 order to specifically\nsay anything about a second opinion for Autism; but an\nassessment for such would have been a part of the restated order\nfor OFS to get a second opinion on.\nFCW 2 reported she did not obtain, or attempt obtain the\nsecond opinion via a medical doctor related to Child A’s leg and\nspeech because Child A was being seen medically, OFS did not\nhave a doctor noting any concerns; and a second opinion was\npursued by her through Early On. Additionally, OFS thought Early\nOn would be able to complete a developmental assessment, and\nrefer onward/elsewhere if Child A required other medical services.\nI advised FCW 2 getting a second opinion commonly means\ngetting another medical opinion; and I inquired\nwhy OFS had not done that. FCW 2 reported she spoke with POS\nMonitor XX early in February 2023 about what to do about\ncompleting the court’s second opinion order. POS Monitor XX\nknew about the order because POS Monitor XX was also at the\nJanuary 2023 court hearing. POS Monitor XX reported POS\nMonitor XX would confer with the Health Liaison\nOfficer (HLO) so see what could be done related to insurance\ncoverage. In middle March 2023 POS Monitor XX reported\nChild A’s foster parents would have to pay out of pocket if the\nfoster parents wanted a second opinion/assessment via a medical\nfacility, like Beaumont hospital. For Child A’s health\ninsurance to cover any other medical provider like a Beaumont\nhospital provider, the foster parents would need a referral from\nChild A’s primary doctor or a referral from Early On. Thus, since\nthe original court order said second opinion and did not specify.\nthrough a medical doctor, OFS thought it was following the\ncourt’s order with the Early On pursuit..\nI asked FCW 2 if the Early On was intended as the second opinion\nwhy was the Early On assessment so late in the timeframe with\nrespect to the 1/23/2023 court order. FCW 2 denied not acting\ntimely. She said, she made the Early On referral on 1/31/2023\nonce the foster parents signed the form. The intake appointment\nwas set for 2/28/2023; and the assessment was set for\n4/5/2023(later changed to 4/7/2023). A family team meeting (FTM)\nwas held in early February, which was attended by the foster\nparents and GAL X. The Early On referral and the time frames for\nassessment was discussed at that FTM, no objections were\nvoiced at that time by anyone. FCW 2 said she reported all of that\nsame information at the March 2023 court hearing; but that was\n5",
    "not sufficient. The GAL wants Child A seen via Beaumont hospital\nfor the second opinion. FCW 2 reported the plan at this time is to\nchange Child A’s primary health provider from Doctor P to Doctor\nBL. The GAL reported speaking with Doctor BL and Doctor BL\ntakes Medicaid. POS Monitor XX also reports a number of\nchildren in foster care see Doctor BL, so the health care provider\nswitch will be done. An examination appointment is set for\n4/12/2023.\nFCW 2 reported OFS had not explored switching Child A’s primary\nmedical health care provider to enable them to get the medical\nsecond opinion, because the foster parents had not indicated a\nconcern with Child A’s health care provider Doctor P. Additionally,\nOFS thought the Early On referral would get Child A to an\nadvance treatment provider; and OFS would select Beaumont.\nFurthermore, FCW 2 reported Child A’s foster parents are very\nassertive foster parents and if the foster parents felt Child A’s\nneeds were not being fulfilled these foster parents would not\nhesitate to speak up or seek outside sources. FCW 2 was not sure\nwhy the GAL, or court had not suggested switching Child A’s\nhealth care provider earlier.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) 3:\nFCS 3 affirmed information as reported by FCW 2 related to why\nOFS pursued an Early On referral and assessment as it way of\nobtaining a second opinion pertaining to Child A’s reported health\ncare issues. FCS 3 reported Child A’s foster parents, Foster\nParent B and Foster Parent C did not bring concerns related to\nChild A up to FCW 2, but shared them with the GAL. FCS 3\nreported Child A has parenting times at OFS and neither FCW 2,\nnor Child A’s parents have noticed an issue with Child A’s legs.\nFCS 3 reported the GAL does not reach out to FCW 2 or contact\nOFS about concerns, in an effort to address them. The GAL only\ncommunicates with the POS monitor. The GAL attended an FTM\nbefore the 1/23/2023 court hearing and the GAL never mentioned\nany issues.\nOn 4/27/2023 FCS 3 provider clarification related OFS possibly\nnot knowing that Early On was already working with Child A; and\nreportedly OFS trying to link Child A up with OFS’s Early On’s\nsystem, as reported by the foster parents. FCS 3 advised that\nFCW 2 initially referred Child A for Early On in January or\nFebruary of 2022 when Child A entered care. The referral was\nassigned to Early On through the Oakland Health Department\n(OHD). After Child A was assessed, the foster parents reported\nChild A did not qualify for services. OFS was not made aware that\n6",
    "Child A was getting monthly nurse check ins through OHD until\nOFS made another referral for Early On in January of 2023. The\nreferral in January of 2023 was made due to the foster parents\nreporting to the GAL they had concerns with Child A's speech and\nwalking. Once OFS made the second Early On referral, OFS was\ncontacted by the Early On team with OHD stating Child A was\nalready in services, but the foster parents had not returned any\nphone calls from them or participated in the monthly check ins in\nseveral months. FCS 3 reported that somehow the foster parents\nmade an appointment with Early On at OFS and this was later\ncanceled by the OFS Early On worker due to that worker seeing\nthat Child A was already getting Early On services through OHD.\nThe latter is still in place, and it appears Early On with OHD\nattempted to contact the foster parents on 4/12/2023.\nPOS Monitor XX\nOn April 14, 2023, I interviewed POS Monitor XX by telephone.\nPOS Monitor XX reported similar information as FCW 2 related to\nthe outcome of the 1/23/2023 court hearing; the foster parents\nreporting some concern with Child A’s leg and speech to the GAL\nwhich the foster parents had not reported as concerns to the\nagency. POS Monitor XX reported at the 1/23/2023 court hearing\nthe GAL requested a second opinion based on the concerns the\nGAL brought up. The GAL reported the second opinion could be\nthrough Beaumont hospital, but it did not have to be through\nBeaumont hospital. POS Monitor XX said she enlisted the\nassistance of the HLO, pertaining to this matter. She reported,\nbecause they had no documented information related to the health\nconcerns reported by the GAL the HLO suggested that the agency\ngo back to Child A’s primary health care doctor. POS Monitor XX\nsaid Child A’s tongue-tied issues was being addressed, Child A\nwas only 13 months old at that time and the foster parents had not\nmentioned a concern with that. The only concern was the speech\nand the report of Child A dragging her leg. OFS was working on\ngoing back to Child A’s primary doctor just prior to the March 2023\ncourt hearing. OFS had completed the Early On referral and OFS\nthought that would get everything worked out.\nPOS Monitor XX reported in her experience the Early On\nassessment would have been sufficient for evaluation of Child A’s\nspeech. She was not aware as to whether it would take care of\nany needs for occupation therapy. POS Monitor XX did not think\nall was as the GAL had indicated. She said, OFS made efforts to\nfulfill the court’s orders based on what OFS thought was the\nissues. It was because of all that the GAL was requesting that the\nagency reached out to POS Monitor XX. The GAL had concerns\n7",
    "with Child A’s primary care doctor; the GAL thought Doctor P was\ntoo young, was not as experienced as his mother who was\nretiring. The GAL wanted someone more experienced to assess\nChild A.\nPOS Monitor XX reported, the primary health care provider issue\ngot addressed, and Child A had an appointment with Doctor BL\nvia Beaumont on 4/14/2023. Doctor BL gave a referral, for Child A\nrelated to the tongue-tied issue through an ENT (Ear, Nose and\nThroat) doctor, and for Child A’s leg through a walk and gait\nprovider. All the referrals were with Beaumont hospital providers.\nAt the doctor appointment, Doctor BL reported not being\nconcerned with Child A’s speech because Child A is too young. As\nfor an Autism assessment, the doctor thought it was too early for\nsuch. POS Monitor XX reported knowing this information because\nFCW 2 attended the doctor’s appointment with Child A’s foster\nparents and asked questions. Doctor BL reported that Child A\nhad good eye contact and focus, and that that would not be seen\nin a child with Autism. The doctor plans to conduct an\nassessment when Child A when Child A is 18 months old.\nFoster Parent B and Foster Parent C\nOn 4/21/2023, via telephone, I spoke with Foster Parent B and\nFoster Parent C who was in the background and responded to\nFoster Parent B when she asked him to verify certain things.\nThese foster parents reported when Child A was placed with them\nin January of 2022, Child A had no identified special needs.\nThey reported the first health concern they reach out to OFS\nabout with respect to Child A was Child A having breathing issues.\nChild A was turning blue. The breathing issues occurred earlier\nwithin the placement, and they cleared up. Those breathing issues\nmay have been related to smoke; Child A was coming home from\nher birth parent visits smelling of smoke. At three months of age\nChild A was diagnosed as being tongue tied and this issue was\nalso reported to FCW 2. Neither Foster Parent B nor Foster\nParent C reported there being anything FCW 2 or OFS were to do\nor followed up on related to Child A’s tongue issue. That the\ndoctor had indicated Child A’s tongue would need to be clipped at\nsome point but expressed no need to do so at any particular point\nin time. That as Child A’s foster parents, they would just continue\nto follow up with the doctor.\nFoster Parent B reported other issues she reported to FCW 2\nwere Child A having swallowing issues, being very aggressive\n(hitting, biting, kicking) and Child A appearing to experience some\ndifficulty lifting her right side/leg. As for the leg issue, Foster\n8",
    "Parent B noticed that some time in December 2022, once Child A\nbegan walking, Child A was dragging her leg and walking\nsideway. Foster Parent B acknowledged that they took Child A to\nsee Child A’s doctor for these issues. Foster Parent B did not\nreport what the doctor reported, about Child A’s swallowing or\naggressive behavior; she reported the doctor (whom she referred\nto as a she) indicated the leg issue may be related to hypotonia.\nThe doctor reported there was no need to do anything now.\nFoster Parent B said she also spoke with the GAL about the\nissues, after the GAL called her about a Team’s meeting the GAL\nhad learned about. During the conversation, she told the GAL\nabout Child A’s leg difficulty, that they had Child A’s walking\nassessed; and it possibly being hypotonia. The GAL did not know\nabout this issue. She also told the GAL the agency said that per\nDoctor P, it’s nothing major. The GAL seemed more concerned\nthan the agency. The GAL asked whether they had discussed\ngetting a second opinion; then the GAL advocated for a second\nopinion at court. After the court hearing, the FCW 2 reached out\nto them and reported that OFS would get a second opinion, but\nthat there was an issue with Child A’s health insurance covering it.\nFCW 2 never reported anything about an Early On assessment\nbeing the second opinion. Foster Parent B reported OFS\ncompleted an Early On referral and wanted Child A to see the\nEarly On provider through their organization. An intake\nappointment was set for 2/28/2023, but no one came out. Once it\nwas discovered or realized that Child A was already with Early On,\nthe 2/28/2023 appointment was changed. OFS had apparently\nforgotten that Child A was already in Early On through another\nsystem that they had referred Child A with earlier in 2022. The\nlatter referral/service was still during COVID, so the Early On\nnurse/representative was not coming to the foster home.\nNurse/Representative LG called once a month and did Zoom\ncontacts.\nFoster Parent B reported after the second opinion was arranged\nvia Beaumont hospital provider, Doctor BL, Child A was seen by\nthat doctor on 4/12/2023; and they also saw Nurse/Representative\nLG for an Early On assessment that same day. Foster Parent B\ndenied telling the GAL information different than what she had\nreported to OFS. She said the GAL just seemed to take her\nreports of concern more serious.\nDocument Review:\nChild A’s MISACWIS Case record which showed:\n9",
    "• Child A is currently 16 months of age. She was placed\nunder OFS’s supervision, and in-Foster Parent B’s and\nFoster C’s foster home on 1/7/2022.\n• She is a temporary court ward who at initial placement\nwas diagnosed as a heathy baby requiring normal care.\n• Child A was reported to be tongue tied; no corrective\naction was documented as needed at this time.\n• A 3/28/2022 well child examination had indicated Child A\nmight have hypertonia, where it is hard for her to move her\nneck, arm, muscles. That this is being monitored to\ndetermine if Child A requires services.\n• Child A’s pediatrician’s office referred her for a\nneurological appointment that was set for 7/28/2022.The\ndoctor determined the appointment was no longer\nnecessary following Child A’s six month’s well child\nexamination that showed she was improving.\n• A 10/22/2022 well examination had indicated Child A was\ncontinuing to improve, making progress and no extra\nservices were needed related to hypotonia. Child A was\nreported to be on track developmentally.\n• That a January 2023 well child examination indicated the\nsame as the October 2022 well child examination related\nto Child A’s wellness and development..\n• An Early On assessment was pending for 4/5/2023 to\nassess Child A’s speech and walking concerns.\nCopies of Child A’s well child exams referenced above (3/28/2022,\n10/10/2022) from Child A’s pediatrician’s office. Also copies of well\nchild examinations for 1/17/2022, 2/14/2022, and 1/6/2023.\n• The 1/17/2022 well child document indicated the patient\nhas an appointment for echocardiogram, however physical\nexamine reveals no cardiac pathology.\n• The 2/14/2022 well child document also referenced well\nchild, and hypotonia.\n• The 1/6/2023 well child document indicated, well child.\nA January 23, 2023, Oakland County Court Order that indicated:\n• “DHHS to refer the child for a second opinion for the child’s\nphysical and speech issues.”\nEarly On referrals completed by OFS dated for:\n• 1/24/2022 (reason indicated, to “establish medical\ncondition”) The referral had other assessment documents\n(ages, stage questionnaire/worksheet, nurse’s statement).\n• And 1/31/2023.\n10",
    "Documentation via emails showing:\n• FCW 2’s effort to obtain POS Monitor XX’s assistance\nrelated to getting Child A assessed via a Beaumont hospital\nprovider.\n• FCW 2 seeking clarification and following up with the GAL\nand POS Monitor XX related to the suggestion by the GAL\nto have Child A’s primary health care provider switched to\nDoctor BL so as to obtain a medical second opinion.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentations, there is insufficient\nevidence to show that OFS did not seek to have the child’s\nphysical and medical needs serviced. Nor that they did not seek to\nobtain a second opinion related to concerns reported related to\nChild A’s leg/walk and speech:\n• Child A’s medical and physical care was being provided for\nand monitored by her primary pediatrician via the\nUniversity Drive Medical Center. Concerns with her\nleg/walk was reported by that pediatrician as possible\nhypotonia and monitored. This doctor reported the\nhypotonia “improved, graduated from neuro”. That Child A\ngraduated from requiring further services/a neurological\nservice.\n• FCW 2/OFS sought to obtain an Early On developmental\nassessment for Child A, as a way to obtain a second\nopinion of her developmental concerns; and if further\nservices were assessed as required, the services could be\npaid for via Child A’s health insurance. Such services\nwould be inclusive of being serviced via a Beaumont\nhospital provider, as Child A’s GAL had mentioned to the\ncourt in January 2023.\n• Once it became clear that a second opinion was meant to\nbe by way of another pediatric provider the agency worked\nwith the GAL and POS Monitor XX to have Child A’s\nprimary health care provider switched; and Child A\nobtained a second medical opinion via her new primary\nhealth care provider Doctor PL.\nVIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n11",
