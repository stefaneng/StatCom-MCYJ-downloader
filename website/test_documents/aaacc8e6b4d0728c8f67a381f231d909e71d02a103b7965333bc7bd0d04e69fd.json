The Chief Administrator of the agency was interviewed.\n2",
    "Documents were also reviewed. What follows is information obtained from the\naforementioned sources.\nOn 07/10/19 the Chief Administrator was informed of the allegations.\nOn 11-4-19 the Chief Administrator was interviewed on site. The Chief Administrator\nacknowledged that special investigations had been overdue but had been\ncompleted. The Chief Administrator reported that staff turnover had contributed to\nthe late completion of the investigations.\nThis writer then conducted a review of foster home files and various documents.\n1. Foster Home 1 (CF040385588). A special investigation, #2018C062412, was\nopened on 11/09/17 and the special investigation was closed on 12/14/18. The\nspecial investigation and the corrective action plan addressing rule violations\nwere found in the MISACWIS system.\n2. Foster Home 2 (CF600339427). A special investigation, #2016C0621807 was\ninitiated on 01/28/16 and a DHHS-259 closing the investigation was found in the\nelectronic file. The DHHS-259 indicates that the investigation was closed on\n02/23/16. The electronic file did not contain the special investigation. The Chief\nAdministrator looked for a “hard copy” of the investigation but reported that there\nwas no report or documentation that the investigation had been completed other\nthat the DHHS-259 closing the investigation.\n3. Foster Home 3 (CF040317197), was closed on 02/21/19. There were 3 special\ninvestigations that were not completed as required by the rule.\nSpecial investigation #2018C0624674 was opened on 01/25/18, not completed,\nand closed on 12/12/18.\nSpecial investigation #2016C0622041 was opened on 04/14/16, not completed,\nand closed on 12/14/18.\nSpecial Investigation #2016C0622452 was opened on 06/14/16, not completed,\nand closed on 12/14/18.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(3) An agency shall complete a special evaluation within 45\ncalendar days after receipt of the information. If additional\ntime is required, then the agency shall inform the foster\nparent, in writing, of the basis for the extension and the\nexpected length of the extension. The total time for the\n3",
    "completion of the investigation shall not exceed 90\ncalendar days without written approval from the chief\nadministrator or his or her designee.\nANALYSIS: Special Investigation #2018C0622412, for Foster Home 1, was\ncompleted late by approximately 1 year.\nSpecial Investigation # 2016C0621807 for Foster Home 2 was\nnot completed. A completed investigation and report could not\nbe located. Foster Home 2 is an open licensed foster home. The\nagency will be required to complete this investigation and the\ncorrective action plan should reflect this.\nSpecial investigations # 2018C0624674, #2016C0622041, and\n#2016C0622452 for Foster Home 3 were late. Since the foster\nhome is closed, completion of the special investigations cannot\nbe achieved. The agency will be required to submit a corrective\naction plan which prevents late special investigations.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that the agency did not complete thorough special investigations of\nfoster homes.\nINVESTIGATION:\nSpecial investigations #2018C0624674, #2016C0622041, and #2016C0622452, for\nFoster Home 3, were closed without having been completed. The following language\nwas used throughout each of the 3 investigation reports where answers to questions\ncontained on the CWL-4005 are required;\n“08/16/2018 - this is unknown. The worker and supervisor no longer work for this\nagency.\nClosing this SE in order to close the license on this home. Child was removed, per\nfoster parent's request, at the time the investigation was initiated.”\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in\nthe agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(c) Conduct a thorough investigation including all\nnecessary collateral contacts.\nANALYSIS: Each of the 3 special investigations for Foster Home 3 were\nclosed without having been completed while the foster home\nwas still open. The justification for not completing the\ninvestigations was that agency personnel who had opened the\ninvestigations no longer worked for the agency and the agency\nwanted to close the license.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nDuring the course of this investigation the license recommendations resulting from\nthe special investigations were reviewed. The three investigations for Foster Home 3\ndocumented the following license recommendations.\nSpecial Investigation # 2018C0624674. The DHHS-259 for this investigation\ndocumented, “Continue current status”.\nSpecial investigation #2016C0622041. The DHHS-259 for this investigation\ndocumented “Continue current status”.\nSpecial Investigation # 2016C0622452. The DHHS-259 for this investigation\ndocumented “Denial of issuance”.\nThe licensing recommendation stemming from special investigation\n#2016C0621807 for Foster Home 2 documents on the DHHS-259, “Continue\ncurrent status”.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12325 License recommendation.\n(1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nappropriate licensing action consistent with facts\n5",
    "contained in the foster home evaluation and any special\nevaluations.\nANALYSIS: The three special investigations for Foster Home 3 and the one\nspecial investigation for Foster Home 2 were not completed.\nTherefore, the licensing recommendations based upon those\ninvestigations were not based on the facts of the circumstances\nbeing investigated, rather ease of completion for the worker, as\nclearly noted in the 3 investigations for Foster Home 3.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDING:\nDuring the course of the interview with the Chief Administrator she had reported that\nthe special investigations that are the focus of this investigation had been completed.\nAn email dated 12/06/18 from the DCWL Assistant Director to the Agency Chief\nAdministrator and Licensing Supervisor details the process for completing the special\ninvestigations. The special investigation for Foster Home 2 had not been completed\nfrom the date of the 12/06/18 email until the 11/04/19 on site visit by this writer. The\nthree investigations for Foster Home 3 had not been completed from the date of the\n12/06/19 email until the home closed on 02/21/19. The DHHS-259’s for each of the\ninvestigations for Foster Homes 2 and 3 recommended licensing action incongruent\nwith the incomplete investigations.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n1) An agency shall designate that the chief administrator is\nresponsible for the day-to-day operation of the agency and\nfor ensuring compliance with the applicable provisions of\nthese rules.\nANALYSIS: The Chief Administrator failed to ensure that the special\ninvestigations were completed initially, but also from the date of\nthe DCWL Assistant Directors directives on 12/06/18. In\naddition, licensing recommendations were made based upon\nincomplete investigations.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan the recommendation is for\ncontinuance of the regular license.\nNovember 12, 2019\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 2, 2019\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
