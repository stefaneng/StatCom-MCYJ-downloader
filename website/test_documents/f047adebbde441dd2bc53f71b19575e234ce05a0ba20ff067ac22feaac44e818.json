Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisors and coworkers are available to assist as\nneeded and information is shared promptly. Staff did not report any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, licensing and adoption services.
