METHODOLOGY\n06/25/2021 Special Investigation Intake\n2021C0446002\n06/25/2021 Inspection Completed On-site\nInterviewed staff, interview child, reviewed incident report, and\nobserved location of incident.\n06/25/2021 Contact - Telephone call made\nMessage left for Foster Care worker\n06/29/2021 Inspection Completed On-site\nInterviewed staff\n07/01/2021 Contact - Face to Face\nReviewed video footage on-site.\n07/01/2021 Contact - Telephone call made\nInterviewed Staff person 1.\n07/15/2021 Contact - Telephone call made\nPre-Exit findings reviewed with Director of Residential Services.\nALLEGATION:\nOn 6/24/21, youth was outside and acting out. When attempting to go inside, a staff\nmember blocked youth and pushed youth backward. Youth became more\nescalated. When the door was opened, youth kicked staff member and staff\nmember pushed youth back a second time.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Youth A at Christ Child House on 06/25/2021. Youth A disclosed on\n06/24/2021 he was outside playing and wanted to go in the house and was told by\nShift Supervisor he could not go in the house. He said Shift Supervisor closed the\ndoor and would not let him enter, so he got angry and punched the door and the\nwindow. He denied being pushed, but said that he did kick Shift Supervisor, because\nhe would not let him go inside. Youth A reported that there were two other staff\noutside during the incident. He denied getting hurt or having any injuries. Youth A\nreported he was angry and frustrated because he could not go inside. Youth A\n2",
    "reported that after the incident he walked outside until he calmed down. Youth A\nreported he feels safe and expressed no worries or concerns.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator at Christ Child House on 06/25/21. She reported\nthat Shift Supervisor has been suspended for two weeks as a result of the incident\nand will not have any contact with Youth A. She reported that Youth A has gotten\nvery aggressive the past several months. He has broken windows, doors, and is\nvery aggressive with the staff. She has submitted a 30-day notice to have him\nremoved.\nI reviewed incident report dated 06/24/21 written by Staff 1. The incident report\nstated that on 06/24/21 Youth A asked to go back in the building, and Shift\nSupervisor told Youth A he could not come in the building at this time. Youth A\npunched the window and was attempting to get into the building. Staff 1 tried to\nredirect Youth A away from the building. Shift Supervisor came outside and that’s\nwhen Youth A kicked him. Shift Supervisor caught Youth A’s foot, while Staff A was\ntrying to stop the situation from going any further. Youth A calmed down and was\nescorted away from the building.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at Christ Child House on 06/29/21. Staff 1 reported on\n06/24/2021 he was outside with four youth and Youth A was doing flips on the\nswing, so he told Youth A not to do flips because he can get hurt. Youth A got angry\nand wanted to go in the building and that’s when Shift Supervisor told him he could\nnot go inside at that moment and closed the door. Youth A started to punch the door\nand the window. Staff 1 reported he tried to redirect Youth A away from the building,\nbut Youth A refused and that’s when Shift Supervisor opened the door. Youth A\nkicked Shift Supervisor and Shift Supervisor caught Youth A’s foot, and that’s when\nStaff 1 caught Youth A from falling backwards. Staff 1 reported he and Staff 2\nwalked Youth A away from the building until he calmed down. Staff 1 reported an\nincident reported was completed.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at Christ Child House on 06/29/21. Staff 2 reported that on\n06/24/2021, he did not witness Shift Supervisor push Youth A. He reported he did\nwitness Youth A kick Shift Supervisor and Shift Supervisor caught his foot and that’s\nwhen Youth A fell backwards and was caught by Staff 1 from falling. Youth A was\nangry and being aggressive.\nI reviewed the video footage at Christ Child House on 07/01/2021 from the incident\non 06/24/2021. The video shows at 04:20 pm Shift Supervisor is blocking the door\nwhile Youth A is trying to come inside the building. Shift Supervisor uses his left\nhand to push Youth A on his chest away from the door and closes the door. Youth A\npunches the door and the window next to the door. Staff 1 is seen redirecting Youth\nA away from the building. Shift Supervisor opens the door and Youth A kicks him.\nShift Supervisor catches Youth A’s foot, which resulted in Youth A falling backward\nand Staff 1 caught Youth A from falling.\n3",
    "I interviewed the Director of Residential Services at Christ Child House on\n07/01/2021. She reported Shift Supervisor reaction to the situation was not\nappropriate. She reported that she teaches the CPI trainings at Christ Child House\nand when a youth is combative (punching or hitting) staff is to block and back away.\nA copy of their restraint policy was reviewed.\nI interviewed Shift Supervisor via telephone on 07/01/21. Shift Supervisor reported\nhe has been working at Christ Child House for 12 years. He reported Youth A got\nupset because he was told not to do flips on the swings. He reported Youth A was\ntrying to come inside and he told him cannot come inside at that moment. He\nreported they would have been out of ratio. He said that he moved him away and\nclosed the door. Shift Supervisor reported Youth A started to punch the door and\nwindow, so he opened the door and that’s when Youth A kicked Shift Supervisor in\nthe stomach. Shift Supervisor responded by grabbing Youth A’s foot. Youth A began\nto fall backward and Staff 1 caught him. Shift Supervisor reported he was hurt as a\nresult of the kick, had to seek medical attention, and had abdominal contusion. He\nreported he was suspended for two weeks.\nI completed a pre-exit conference of preliminary findings with Director of Residential\nServices via telephone on 07/15/2021. There is sufficient evidence in the video that\nshow’s Shift Supervisor pushing Youth A.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(a) Any type of corporal punishment inflicted in any\nmanner.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as Shift Supervisor was\nobserved in video footage to push Youth A using physical force\nas a means of behavior management.\nTechnical Assistance\nAlthough the TCI model does not address specifically how a\nstaff member should respond to a youth kicking them, it does\nstate that staff should remain at least a leg length away from the\nyouth. Supervisor was observed to grab the youth’s leg. Staff\nshould be reminded of TCI practice to keep distance between\nstaff and escalated youth, as well as to step away and block a\nkick opposed to grabbing youth’s leg which restricts the youth’s\nfree movement.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR2021C0217020 dated 3/24/21, CAP approval dated 4/15/21\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend no change in the\nlicense status.\nNabiha Rizk July 27, 2021\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 26, 2021\n______________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
