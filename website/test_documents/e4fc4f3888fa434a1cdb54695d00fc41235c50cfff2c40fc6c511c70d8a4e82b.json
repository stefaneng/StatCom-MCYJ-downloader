The plan must address",
    "why the agency responsibility changed and\nwhether there are any modifications to existing\nservice plans.\nOne of the eight foster child records reviewed did not include a modified service\nplan within 30 days of the change in case responsibilities from another agency to\nthis agency.\nCPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n• (2) An agency shall complete written service\nplans for each child and parent or parents, as\nfollows:\n• (a) Within 30 calendar days from removal\nfrom the home.\nOne of the eight foster child records reviewed contained an initial service plan\nthat was completed outside the time frame established by this rule.\nCPA Rule 400.12422 Foster care case record\n• (3) The record must contain all the following\ninformation:\n(e) Change of placement documentation as\nrequired by R 400.12405.\nOne of the four discharged foster child records reviewed did not have change in\nplacement/closing documentation completed within the time frame established by\nthis rule. In this example the discharge date was identified as 1/19/2024 and the\ndischarge documentation was completed 2/27/2024.\nFOM 722-06B Family Team Meeting\nThe DHS-1105, Family Team Meeting Report, is used\nto capture family demographics, FTM logistical\ninformation, needs, strengths, action steps, safety\nconcerns and the safety plan, and any\nrecommendations made for the family during the FTM.\nThe DHS-1105, Family Team Meeting Report, must be\ncompleted for every FTM.",
    "Three of the eight foster child records and one of the three independent living\nyouth records reviewed did not include the required Family Team Meeting\ndocumentation for compliance with this standard.\nRepeat Violation Established\nInterim dated 7/11/2023, CAP approved 7/14/2023.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• No technical assistance was requested or required.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• No consultation was requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were 3 incidents to assess corporal punishment during this licensing period.\nSpecial Evaluation report #2024C00001169 involved a relative caregiver giving a\ngrandchild a birthday spanking. This was not harsh or a disciplinary method and\nnoncompliance was not established.\nSpecial Evaluation report #2023C0000487 involved a foster parent restraining a\nyouth by grabbing the youths coat when the youth was attempting to truant. This\nwas determined to be reasonable for the circumstances and noncompliance was\nnot established.\nSpecial Evaluation report #2024C0001358 involved an incident where a youth\nstruck a foster parent, and the foster parent allegedly restrained the youth. The\nfindings determined the foster parent deescalated the situation by providing\ndistance from the combative youth, so noncompliance was not established.",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The\nagency had 7 identified areas of noncompliance as a part of the interim evaluation\ncompleted 7/11/2023. Noncompliance included Rules 418(6), 418(2)(b),\n413(1)(f)(i), 327(6)(c), 327(7), 507(1), and FOM 722-06B. The CAP for these\nareas of noncompliance was approved 7/14/2023. Areas identified as repeat\nnoncompliance as a part of this renewal evaluation are Rule 418(2)(b) and FOM\n722-06B. The ability of the agency to maintain adequate staffing was a primary\ndetermining factor to establish and maintain compliance. At the time of this review\nthe agency has been able to stablize their staffing situation.\nSpecial Investigation #2023C0000708SI, intake date 8/17/2023 identified\nnoncompliance with Rule 400.12206(2). The CAP for this noncompliance was\napproved 11/17//2023. Information confirming the termination of the staff member\ninvolved in this situation was received 2/19/2024 and staff training related to the\ncircumstances of this incident was scheduled for 2/28/2024 were parts of this\nCAP.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was a review of the areas of noncompliance\nidentified in previous interim evaluations and special investigations. A primary\nconcern/barrier in establishing compliance is the ability to recruit and maintain\nappropriate staffing levels for the number of youth and families being served. The\nagency is continuing to modify some processes to overcome this barrier to\nestablish and maintain compliance. The Chief Administrator Assessment also\nincluded the status of the agency related to Key Performance Indicators.\nFinancial Overview\nThe financial audit and current budget received was reviewed and indicated\nadequate financial resources are available to meet the needs of those who are\nserved.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviews were positive and reflected the ongoing transitions occurring\nwithin the agency/program.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has adequate space, and the building is well maintained. The record\nstorage is in compliance with licensing rules.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two identified safety alerts.\nSafety Alert #1: The home did not have their medications stored securely.",
    "Resolution: This was resolved when the family locked the primary bathroom where\nthe medication was stored as confirmed by video and photo confirmation.\nSafety Alert #2: The home did not have smoke detectors installed in the appropriate\nareas of the home.\nResolution: The agency provided the family with the smoke detectors and the proper\ninstallation of the detectors was confirmed with photo confirmation.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n4/10/2024\n_____________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 17, 2024\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
