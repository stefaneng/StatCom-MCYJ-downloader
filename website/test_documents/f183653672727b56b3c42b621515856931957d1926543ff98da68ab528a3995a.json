One of the\nfour the staff was hired on 11/23/20, but the 1326 was not processed until 12/1/20,\none of the four lacked a 1326 altogether, and two of the four documented that a\n1326 was submitted to DCWL and processed, but the facility did not have the\ncompleted 1326 in their files,\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of human services, the equivalent\nstate or Canadian provincial agency, or equivalent agency in the country where the\nperson usually resides, that the person has not been determined to be a perpetrator\nof child abuse or child neglect. The documentation shall be completed not more\nthan 30 days prior to the start of employment and every 12 months thereafter.\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this\nrule:\n(j) A written evaluation of the employee's performance within\n30 days of the completion of the probationary period or within\n180 days, whichever is less, and a written evaluation of the\nemployee’s performance annually thereafter.\nEight and twenty-five files of employee’s hired since the last inspection reviewed did\nnot have a written evaluation completed, as required. In four of the eight files a letter\nremoving the staff from probation period was found, but no evaluation of the staff’s\nperformance was completed. In the other four files a probationary written evaluation\nwas not completed within the required timeframe.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nLSR dated 2/12/2019; Corrective Action Plan Approved 2/19/2019\nLSR dated 2/18/2020; Corrective Action Plan Approved 3/6/2020\nR 400.4161 Seclusion rooms; policies and procedures.\nAn institution approved to use a seclusion room shall establish\nand follow written policies and procedures specifying its use.\nThe policy shall include, at a minimum, all of the following\nprovisions:\n(g) The room shall be equipped to minimize suicide risk and\nrisk of physical injury.

The Chief\nAdministrator stated that the room is used for Telehealth meetings.\n5",
    "2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHHS Contract/Policy violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included in\nsection 1. The facility is in compliance with all additional DHHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements except for the following:\nRFCAN Contractor Responsibilities-Services to be Provided-\n2.10.b.1.2. Standardized Assessment Tools\nThe Contractor shall utilize the following assessment tools\nto assess the child’s needs and strengths while in the\nresidential program:\n2) Ansell Casey Life Skills or Daniel Memorial Assessment\n(For children 14 years of age and older)\nThe Contractor may utilize additional standardized and\nreliable assessment tools to assess overall progress in\nfunctioning. Additional program specific assessment tools\nare identified within each program type in Attachment A.\nThe Contractor shall administer the assessment tools\nwithin 30 calendar days of admission, and quarterly\nthereafter until planned discharge. An unplanned discharge\nis defined as an immediate (one calendar day or less) move\nfrom the Contractor’s program as directed by the court or\ncaseworker. Children who are Absent Without Legal\nPermission (AWOLP) are also considered an unplanned\ndischarge.\nTwo of three open residential youth files reviewed did not have the required\nassessments completed according to the prescribed timeframes. One file contained\nan assessment completed after the youth had been placed at the facility over 30\ndays and the other has not had a new assessment in since 8/5/2020. The third file\nreviewed was of a youth under the age of 14, thus the assessment is not required.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nThe human resources department expressed confusion about the 1326 clearance\nprocess as they were continuing to request central registry and criminal history\nclearances independently and not waiting for the DCWL completed 1326 before hiring\nnew employees, as is required. Additionally, the HR department was under the\n6",
    "impression that they could hire any employee with a pending out of state clearance,\neven if they had not received the DCWL completed 1326, citing an email they\nbelieved gave this direction. The email they cited did state that waiting for an out of\nstate clearance should not prevent hiring; however, the email continued on to state\nthat, even in the case of a pending out of state clearance, the DCWL completed 1326\nmust be obtained prior to hire.\nV. CONSULTATION\nNo consultation was required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. These CAPs have been monitored quarterly\nfor compliance.\nDuring the unannounced inspection the majority of the youth were at school;\nhowever, at least two youth were observed in each home to be either working on\nschoolwork or completing chores. No concerns were raised by interviews conducted\nwith neither the youth nor staff interviewed. Structurally, there were some minor\nrepairs being completed while I was on-site to address issues identified during the\nenvironmental inspection, which resulted in that inspector issuing an “A” rating.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MSA requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nFebruary 18, 2021\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n7",
