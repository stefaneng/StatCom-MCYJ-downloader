During her\ndescription of the incident in question she stated she tried to grab\nher medications out of the locked cabinet where they were\nstored. Youth A said the cabinet is located inside of the locked\noffice area. Youth A stated the cabinet was locked at the time, but\nthe doors do not close tightly.

In this policy it was stated\n“medications must be kept in locked compartments under\nproper temperature.”\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth, documentation reviewed and an\non-site inspection there was evidence found that the facility failed\n4",
    "to properly store youth’s medication, allowing them to gain access\nto it at their will.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility is advised to seek better solutions to the\nstorage of medications. The incident in question may not\nhave escalated to the point of physical contact had the\nmedication been stored in a manner that was clearly safe\nand secured.\n• The facility is advised to explore expanded medication\nadministration training among staff. The incident in\nquestion may not have escalated further had there been\nmore availability of a staff member that could administer\nmedication at any given time.\nConclusion Violation established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Based on the findings in this report a CAP is required.\nPer SIR #2024C0001037SI, a 1st provisional license is recommended.\n04/08/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/18/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
