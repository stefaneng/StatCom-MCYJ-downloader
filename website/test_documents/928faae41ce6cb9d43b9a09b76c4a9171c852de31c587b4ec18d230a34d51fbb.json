    "completed by the agency staff. Addtionally, that a meeting was held with all staff on\nverbal de-escalation on 1/15/2022; the agency discipline policy is now posted in\nclear view for all staff to see related to their requirement to report; the agency would\nreach out to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) related to\nscheduling mandated reporting training; and would train all staff on mandated\nreporting by 8/1/2022. Lastly the corrective action plan indicated all staff signed a\nsign-off sheet of their review of the agency’s policy against physical discipline and\nrestrant, which would be placed in the employee’s file and the policy would be\nposted for all to see. During the onsite visit on 1/25/2023, records were reviewed,\nthe agency’s posted policy board was briefly reviewed and a screenshot of it was\nalso provided by the agency. Meetings and training sign-in sheets, staff noncrisis\nintervention training certificates were provided/observed; and vertification of the\ninvolved case manager’s termination on 3/10/2022 and manadated reporting\ntraining completion by DHHS-MIC (Maltreatment In Care) was also\nobserved/verified. With respect to the mandated reporting training, one of the MIC\nworkers who completed the training for the agency confirmed the training occurred\non 7/6/2022 for 15- 20 agency staff. No other incident like what was alleged in this\nincident has been indicated/cited, since the complaint.

The allegations were that the\nagency is not staffing the independent living facility as outlined in their contract; and\nthe agency withheld all of a youth’s independent living stipend without justification.\nNo rule violation was cited for the first allegation. With respect to the second\nallegation, the agency was found in violation of FOM 722-03 for Independent Living\nStipend. The agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan that indicated\nthe agency director held a meeting with the program manager on 9/21/2022 related\nto the stipend incident/process; and the program manager and all staff were trained\non independent living stipend requirements on that date. Additionally, that the staff\n6",
    "involved in the incident was disciplined via a verbal warning; the program manager\nand case manager would monitor proof of receipt of stipend by youths monthly\n(November, December 2022 & January, 2023) with proof of receipt documented in\nthe youth’s file. Also, that the director would review the stipend process with staff\nduring those months. Lastly, that a refresher training on this topic would be\nconducted with the staff at the 1/7/2023 staff meeting.

A sign-in sheet for a\n1/7/2023 refresher stipend process training was also seen. There has been no new\nreported/cited occurrence of this nature since this incident. The agency has\ncompleted this corrective action plan..\nThe agency's second corrective action plan was related to Special Investigation\n2022C0420027 for a complaint initiated 9/20/2022. The allegation was that a youth\nwent AWOL on 8/24/2022, and the facility failed to notify the youth’s parent.\nThe agency received a violation for FOM 722-03A for the Absence without Legal\nPermission policy. The agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan that\nindicated on 12/5/2022, the agency’s director trained the program manager and\ncase manager on the policy; and future monitoring of such incidents would be\nmonitored by the program manager; and these such incidents will be reported to\nthe parent. The agency provided proof of the training with the corrective action\nplan. There has been no new reported occurrences of this nature since this\nincident. The agency has completed this corrective action plan.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator’s report dated 10/3/2022 was received and reviewed.
