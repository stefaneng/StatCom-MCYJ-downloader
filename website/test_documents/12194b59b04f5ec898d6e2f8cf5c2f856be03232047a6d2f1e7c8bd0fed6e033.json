    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n Development of a specific electronic filing system for youth files.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period which was in response to their Renewal\nInspection in 2021. During this Renewal Inspection, the facility was cited for having\nseven of ten employee files without the required performance evaluation occurring.\nThe facility developed a CAP that involved a process of the Clinical Director reviewing\nthe schedule for employee evaluations every 2 months. The Clinical Director’s finding\nwill be provided to the Program Coordinator who will confirm the evaluations are\ncompeted. During this inspection, 11 of 12 personnel files reviewed, required the\nperformance evaluation. All 11 files had the performance evaluation completed as\nrequired.\nCurrently, the facility is in the process in increasing their bed capacity to 7. The facility\nhas reached out to the zoning department to start the process and they are waiting for\nthe zoning inspection to be scheduled. They were informed they need the zoning\napproval before they can have the fire inspection. Once the zoning is approved, they\nwill schedule the fire inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nA review of the Chief Administrator’s Assessment took place. This document outlines\nthe progress made on the CAP for the last inspection in 2021. The Clinical Director\nleft the facility, and the CAP was adjusted to include the Executive Director and Chief\nAdministrator reviewing for the evaluations. There was one violation, and the facility\nis reported to have continued the oversite of personnel files. Once a month the\nexecutive director meets with the manager responsible for evaluations to process\nupcoming employee evaluations. During this inspection, all required evaluations were\ncompleted as required. Also documented on this report is efforts to make changes to\nthe violations identified during this inspection. These issues will be outlined in the\nrequired CAP.\nInterviews\nInterviews were completed with direct care staff, supervisors, and administrator. All\nreport the facility is a positive place for employment with a strong focus on meeting\nthe needs of the youth enrolled in the program. Staff report the facility is providing\nappropriate training which helps provide care for the youth. Administration is open to\nfeedback and seeks ways of improving the service to youth. The four youth were\nobserved and but were non-verbal, so they were unable to be interviewed. Their\n2",
    "interactions with staff appeared very appropriate. Staff were very attentive to the\nneeds of the youth.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on their regular license.\n5/18/2022\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 20, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3"
