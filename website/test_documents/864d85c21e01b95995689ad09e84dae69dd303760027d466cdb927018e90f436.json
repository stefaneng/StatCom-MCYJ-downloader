DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nBethany Christian Services TLC is a single-story residential facility with a\nbasement. When you enter through the front door, there is a storage closet to the\nright, two bathrooms to the left, and another small closet with no door on the left.\nThe door for the stairs leading to the basement as well as the supervisor's office\nare also on the left. Once you turn the corner to the right, the first door on the left\nis a staff office area and the second door on the left is the laundry room. There is\na small hallway on the left, which leads to the therapy office, and a back egress\ndoor leading to the deck with stairs leading down to the gravel/grass area. Back in\nthe main area of the facility, there is an open concept design for the kitchen,\ndining room, living room, and a cubicle area for staff. There are doors leading to\nseven bedrooms (2 singles, 2 doubles, 3 triples), as well as three bathrooms.\nThere is also a door leading to a prayer/private room for youth meditation, and a\nsecond egress door leading outside to the front of the facility. Across from the\nkitchen, there is a hallway with storage closet with cleaning items, and two\npantries. This hallway leads back towards the main front door entrance.\nThe basement has a main living area, a game room with two closets (containing\ngames, school activities/supplies, etc.), an egress door leading outside, and an\noffice for the case management staff. There are cameras throughout the facility\nwhich record video but not sound.\nAn Environmental Health Inspection completed on 12/5/24 received an \"A-\nRating\".\nZoning approval was granted by the City of Grand Rapids planning department on\n9/24/24. This approval was granted for a fully staffed (24/7), 15-bed, State\nLicensed Small Child Caring Institution (CCI) providing residency for 15–17-year-\n2",
    "old unaccompanied minors, including in-house support services and\nprogramming.\nA Quality Fire Inspection completed on 11/1/24 received an \"A-Rating\". A plan\nreview approval and final inspection report from the Bureau of Fire Services were\nnot required as the facility is an existing facility under a different license and not\nconsidered a new facility.\nWalkthroughs of the facility occurred on 8/30/24, 1/13/25 and 2/10/25.\nB. Program Description\nBethany Christian Services TLC (Transitional Living Center) program is a\nspecialized community-based residential licensed home equipped to house single\nunaccompanied refugee minors. The home specialized is both mental health\ntreatment as well as intensive independent living skills preparation, in order to\nprepare program recipients to be successful members of the community upon\ndischarge. The program provides an intensive, structured, and routine-driven\nsetting that incorporates supportive staff members, therapists, community\nsupporters, and volunteers.\nYouth residing in the program are males ages 15-17 who are unaccompanied\nminors new to the United States. The ratio of youth to staff is 1:8 during awake\nhours, and 1:16 during sleeping hours. Many of the youth offer a unique challenge\nfor treatment due to their extensive history of abuse, neglect, or abandonment,\nand subsequent trauma history during travel to the U.S. The program serves\nyouth who have been screened eligible for community-based living after being\nstepped down from shelters as well as secure and staff-secure facilities, after\ncareful screening. Youth at TLC can either be UC UAMs or URMs. There are 8\ndesignated beds for UC UAMs, and 7 for URMs. Both statuses have the same\nresponsibilities and are held to the same standard.\nTLC uses the Personalized Independence Education (PIE) model to highlight the\nimportance of independence and freedom, along with the responsibilities that\ncome with it. Each level, or \"PIE slice\" focuses on an area necessary to live\nindependently. Once the youth master’s the PIE slice, they move onto the next,\nuntil the PIE is completed, and they graduate from the program. The 10 PIE slices\ninclude orientation, US culture, personal health, sexual education, legal, education\n& employment, money management, housing, transition independence, and\nhealth & wellness.\nTLC's treatment philosophy follows the Sanctuary Model of Care, which ensures\ntreatment is trauma responsive. The facility follows Crisis Prevention Institute\n(CPI) for de-escalation as well as physical intervention. This model was approved\nby the DCWL Director on 1/22/25.\n3",
    "TLC has an intensive therapeutic and educationally based skills training program\nto meet the youth's individual needs and utilize the strengths of the youth served.\nYouth are offered a variety of structured activities, groups, classes, and other\nprogramming. These services include cultural orientation group, intensive case-\nmanagement services, 24/7 crisis intervention, advanced independent living skills\ntraining, public school education, English as a second language classes, Spanish\nliteracy classes, tutoring/study time sessions, mentoring services, dialectical\nbehavioral group therapy, recreation/activity therapy, individual therapy by on-site\nprogram therapist, community and in-home activities, and interpretation services.\nIt is anticipated youth in the program stay at TLC until they're ready for\nindependent living, or another appropriate placement. This typically takes\napproximately 9 months but could be shorter or longer depending on the youth's\nindividualized needs as well as available placement resources. Upon intake, each\nyouth is assigned a case manager, who meets with the youth within 24 hours after\nintake, and a minimum of weekly thereafter. Within 30 days of intake, all youth are\nassessed to determine what types of behavioral interventions are required, and a\ndetailed behavioral plan is put into place to ensure a successful transition into the\nhome, school, and community.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nCCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\n(1) An institution shall maintain employee records\nfor each employee and shall include\ndocumentation of all of the following information\nprior to employment or at the time specified in\nthis rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan\ndepartment of human services, the\nequivalent state or Canadian provincial\nagency, or equivalent agency in the\ncountry where the person usually resides,\nthat the person has not been determined\nto be a perpetrator of child abuse or child\nneglect. The documentation shall be\ncompleted not more than 30 days prior to\nthe start of employment and every 12\nmonths thereafter.\nTwo of eight new employee files did not have a central registry clearance\ncompleted within 30 days prior to the employee's date of hire.\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nDue to established rule violations, a written corrective action plan is required.
