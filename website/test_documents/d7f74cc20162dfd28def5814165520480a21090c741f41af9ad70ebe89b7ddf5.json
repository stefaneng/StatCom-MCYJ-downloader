On 10/22/2021, Child A was placed in a shelter in the\nBronx of New York. DHHS-Western Wayne (WW)did not notify her of Child A’s\nremoval from the grandmother’s home or the shelter placement. An attorney in New\nYork, contacted her about the change on 10/29/2021, a week after Child A’s\nremoval from the grandmother’s home.\nThe LGAL expressed concern that Child A’s shelter placement occurred without\nadherence to DHHS policy mandates. Further that DHHS-WW allowed five-year-old\nChild A to be placed in and remain in a shelter for a week. The LGAL reported that\nwhen the court gave permission for Child A to be placed with the grandmother in\nNew York, DHHS-WW removed him from the foster home of Foster Parents (FPS)\nXX in a day, with police assistance, but they left Child A in a shelter for a week.\nOn 11/12/2021 I spoke with Administrator 1, Supervisor 2, Program Manager 3, and\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 4 via a TEAM video contact. I also received email\ninformation from Administrator 1 on 11/16/2021. These staff affirmed Child A’s\n3",
    "placement in a New York Shelter for the time period indicated in the complaint. They\ndenied authorizing it. They arranged for Child A’s return to Michigan as quickly as\nthey could and that occurred on 10/29/2021.\nAdministrator 1 and Supervisor 3 advised that Child A was placed with his maternal\ngrandmother, Relative O. DHHS-WW did not become aware of Child A’s placement\nin a New York shelter until after the fact. New York replaced Child A without notifying\nDHHS-WW until 10/25/2021. On 10/25/2021 New York informed them of the\nreplacement and shared information related to an additional possible abuse/neglect\nallegations in Relative O’s home that lead to the placement change.\nSupervisor 3 and FCW 4 reported New York reported that on 10/22/2021 Child A\nhad parenting time with his mother and New York discovered Child A had an\nadditional bruise. FCW 4 reported that’s when she became aware of Child A having\na black eye.\nAdministrator 1 reported once DHHS-WW was notified of Child A’s placement in the\nshelter on 10/25/2021, DHHS-WW conferenced with New York that same day, as\nwell as on 10/26/2021 to determine if Child A could remain in New York in a safety\nplan. New York was not in agreement with identifying an in-state safety plan.\nTherein, DHHS-WW consulted with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of\nChildren (ICPC). ICPC advised them they needed to pick up Child A within five days\nof receiving notice that Child A was replaced from the ICPC approved placement\nwith Child’s grandmother. They coordinated with ICPC and New York to set up\ntravel arrangements for Child A. Therein, they began making arrangements for\nChild A’s return to Michigan. Child A’s return on 10/29/2021 was the earlier that\ncould be expedited.\nReviewed:\nChild A MISACWIS case record which showed:\n Child A entered care on 11/10/2016; and was placed in the licensed foster\nhome of FPS XX.\n Child A was placed in an adoptive placement with FPS XX in April 2019\nfollowing termination of his birth parent’s rights parental right in June 2018.\nThe adoptive placement was altered in February 2020 when the court\nreinstated the birth mother’s parental rights following an appeal by her of\nChild A’s permanent custody.\n Child A was placed with his maternal grandmother, Relative O on 8/14/2021.\nHe was removed from Relative O’s care on 10/22/2021.\n On 10/29/2021 Child A was returned to Michigan and was placed with Foster\nParents Z.\n Foster Care Placement Decision Notice (DHS-31) showing a replacement for\nChild A from Relative O to Foster Parents Z.\n Two Foster Care/Juvenile Justice Action Summaries (DHS-69). One showing\nChild A’s replacement from Relative O’s home to a shelter in New York on\n4",
    "10/22/2021. Another showing Child A’s replacement from the shelter to the\nFoster Parent Z’s foster home on 10/29/2021.\n A 10/28/2021 social work contact entered 11/16/2021 by Supervisor 3 that\nindicated New York was emailed travel plans for Child A.\n A 10/29/2021 social work contact entered 11/15/2021, by FCW 4. The contact\nindicated FCW 4 completed a flight to New York and transported Child A to\nFoster Parents Z’s foster home in Michigan this date.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-03E Placement exception request.\nPre-10 Placement Exception:\nThe Children's Services Agency (CSA) executive director must\ngrant final approval for the following residential PER types for a\nchild under the age of 10:\n• Residential Placement - Initial.\nThe BSC director must grant final approval for all other\nresidential PERs for children under 10 years of age.\nANALYSIS: The evidence does not show a lack of action or effort to comply\nto this standard. DHHS-WW did not place Child A into a shelter.\nThey did not receive notification of New York’s Children\nServices’ action of replacing Child A from Relative O’s home\ninto a shelter until 10/25/2021. DHHS-WW did not have control\nover New York’s actions or New York’s delay in contacting\nDHHS-WW.\nDHHS-WW asked for a safety plan for Child A. New York\nrequested Child A’s return to his state of jurisdiction. Therein,\nDHHS-WW, focused on getting Child A out of the shelter and\nback to Michigan as quickly as they could. They secured Child\nA’s replacement to Michigan on 10/29/2021.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\n(1) The agency workers failed to notify the court or LGAL of Child A’s change of\nplacement until after 10/22/2021 and did not disclose the shelter placement at that\ntime.\n(2) The agency misrepresented information in reports in an attempt to hide Child A’s\nshelter placement.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 11/8/2021 I spoke with the LGAL by telephone. The LGAL reported DHHS-WW\ndid not notify her of Child A’s removal from the grandmother’s home, and Child A’s\nshelter placement. An attorney in New York, contacted her about the change on\n10/29/2021, a week after Child A’s removal from the grandmother’s home. The LGAL\n5",
    "reported DHHS-WW FCW 4 sent the LGAL an email at 12:22pm on 10/26/2021\nadvising of a Team Decision Meeting (TDM) set for 1:00pm on 10/27/2021. The\nemail did not address that the purpose of the TDM related to a placement change or\nshelter placement for Child A. The LGAL reported she responded to FCW 4’s email\nlater that day asking for the agenda for the TDM, and whether DHHS-WW was\nconsidering a placement change for Child A, and what is that change. FCW 4 never\nresponded to her request for information related to the purpose of the TDM or request\nfor complaint information. On 10/27/2021 FCW 4 sent another email to the LGAL\nchanging the TDM date and time to 10/28/2021 at 10:30am. FCW 4 never reached\nout to the LGAL to check her availability, nor reported in the emails that Child A had\nbeen removed from the grandmother’s home.\nThe LGAL reported Child A was returned to Michigan on 10/29/2021. DHHS-WW\nplaced Child A in a foster home in New Hudson but did not timely supply the LGAL\nwith contact information for Child A’s new foster parents. The LGAL had to reach out\nto DHHS-WW for that information. The LGAL reported when DHHS-WW sent her\ndocumentation of Child A’s replacement to Foster Parents Z’s foster home, it gave\nthe impression he was placed there from Relative’s O home, which was not the case.\nThey tried to hide the shelter placement. The FCW misrepresented information in\nreports related to Child A’s placement change.\nI reviewed Information provided to me by the LGAL which showed:\n On 10/29/2021 Supervisor 3 emailed the DHS-31(Foster Care Placement\nDecision Notice) showing Child A’s placement with Foster Parents Z and\nParents Z’s address, but not Foster Parents Z’s telephone number.\n On 11/1/2021 Program Manager 2 emailed the LGAL Foster Parents Z’s\ntelephone number.\n On 11/2/2021 DHHS-WW emailed the LGAL two DHS-69s(Foster\ncare/Juvenile Justice Action Summary) dated 10/29/2021.\nOn 11/12/2021 I spoke with Administrator 1, Supervisor 2, Program Manager 3, and\nFCW 4 about the allegations via a TEAM’s video contact. Program Manager 2, and\nSupervisor 3 reported they apprised DHHS’s attorney, the Assistant Attorney General\n(AAG) via email of the situation of Child A’s replacement when they became aware of it\non 10/25/2021. They also conferenced with the AAG about the matter on 10/25/2021.\nThe AAG reported he would apprise the LGAL of the situation. Administrator 1 reported\nthat in the past they have had direct contact with an LGAL, but typically they have\ncontact with the AAG. They reported although they shared the information with the\nAAG, FCW 4 was to notify the LGAL, but she “dropped the ball” on that.\nFCW 4 reported that with all that was going on, “it passed me by”, and she did not\ncontact the LGAL on 10/25/2021. She reported sending the LGAL an TDM invite on\n10/26/2021 and again on 10/27/2021, when the TDM was changed from 10/27/2021 to\n10/28/2021, due to not being able to get into touch with Child A’s mother’s attorney.\nFCW 4 acknowledged that the LGAL requested more information about the scheduled\nTDM. Whether the TDM was about a placement change. FCW 4 admitted she did not\n6",
    "reply to that email. She reported not knowing whether the LGAL knew or did not know if\nChild A was placed in a shelter. The LGAL did not attended the TDM. The FCW 4 did\nnot provide the LGAL with a copy of the outcome of the TDM (FTM-Family team\nmeeting) DHS-1105, which may have provided the LGAL information about the shelter\nplacement and how it came to be. Supervisor 3 interjected that, typically they would not\nsend a copy of the DHS-1105 to the LGAL, because the LGAL was not in attendance\nand did not request a copy. Supervisor 3 advised even if they had, given that the TDM\nwas conducted by a facilitator not FCW 4, by the time the DHS-1105 report would have\nbeen written, Child A was already replaced/retuned to Michigan on 10/29/2021.\nSupervisor 3 and FCW 4 both acknowledged the LGAL was provided a DHS-31 via\nemail related to the Child A replacement/return home to Michigan, on 10/29/2021. FCW\n4 admitted the DHS-31 appeared as if Child A went from Relative O’s home to Foster\nParents Z’s home. Supervisor 3 reported the latter was due to FCW 4 not having the\nspecific information/address for the shelter. FCW 4 admitted it would have been\npossible for her to have completed the DHS-31 entering just the New York shelter\nwithout it’s address, but she was busy trying to get other matters completed. She said\nshe followed up with a DHS-69 action summary that showed Child A’s placement from\nthe shelter to Foster Parents Z’s home in Michigan.\nReviewed:\nChild A MISACWIS case record which showed:\n Child A was replaced from Relative O’s home on 10/22/2021 and placed in a\nNew York Shelter.\n A 10/28/2021 FTM (Family Team Meeting/ for TDM) for a TEAM’s video TDM\ndocumentation which showed DHHS-WW indicating DHHS- foster care staff\nwould fly to New York to pick up Child A and return him to Michigan. New\nYork CPS had received complaints of physical abuse while Child A was in\nRelative O’s care. Child A would remain in New York’s Children services’\ncustody, in the shelter placement until he leaves New York. That, per\nMichigan ICPC (Interstate Placement of Children) DHHS-WW has five days to\nremove Child A and place his elsewhere.\n A Foster Care Placement Decision Notice (DHS-31) showing Child A\nreplacement from Relative O to Foster Parents Z’s home on 10/29/2021.\n Two Foster Care/Juvenile Justice Action Summaries (DHS-69). One showing\nChild A’s replacement from Relative O’s home to a shelter in New York on\n10/22/2021. Another showing Child A’s replacement from the shelter to Foster\nParents Z’s foster home on 10/29/2021.\n A copy of a 10/26/2021 emails from DHHS- WW for a 10/27/2021 TDM for\nChild A related to Placement stability. The LGAL was included in the email.\nThe emails did not list an agenda.\n A copy of an 10/26/2021 email from the LGAL asking for agenda topics for\nthe TDM and whether DHHS was considering a change of placement, and if\nso, the proposed new placement.\n A copy of a 10/8/2021 email between the AAG and FCW 4 where the AAG\nadvised FCW 4 to keep him up to speed on the abuse/neglect allegations\n7",
    "pertaining to Child A’s relatives; and that if there is a change of placement\nFCW 4 should immediately notify him and the LGAL.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR400.12405 Change of placement.\n(3) The agency shall document all of the following in the\nchild’s record before a change in placement occurs:\n(f) Notification to the parents, referral source, lawyer\nguardian ad litem and courts when applicable of the change\nin placement.\nANALYSIS: The agency did not directly or timely contact the LGAL to inform\nher of Child A’ placement into a shelter when they became\naware of it on 10/25/2021. They submitted a DHS-69 showing\nthat placement change to the LGAL on 11/2/2021, which was\nalso after the required timeframe connected to DHHS policy.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR400.12206 Staff qualifications.\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\ncontact with children or parents to be a person who has the\nability, experience, education, and training to perform the\nduties assigned.\nANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to support that the agency\npurposefully misrepresented placement information on the DHS-\n31. Nor that the agency tried to conceal Child A’s placement in a\nNew York shelter.\nThe worker’s completion of the DHS-31 was very inadequate in\nthat she did not take the time to ensure its accuracy or correct it.\nThe follow up documents the agency provided the LGAL via two\nAction Summaries (DHS-69) showed the placement scenario\naccurately. One DHS-69 showed Child A’s placement from his\ngrandmother’s home to a New York shelter, the other his\nplacement from the New York shelter to Foster Parents Z’s\nhome in Michigan.\nThe evidence does not show the staff’s inability or lack of\neducation or experience to perform the duties assigned.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n8",
    "ALLEGATION:\nThe foster care worker did not share all information related to complaints received\nagainst the relatives Child A resided with in New York.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 11/8/2021 I interviewed the LGAL by telephone. The LGAL reported that on\n10/27/2021 she emailed DHHS-WW asking that they provide her the results and all\ncopies of reports related to New York child protective services’ investigation(s). FCW\n4 never responded to her request. Nor provided her all the information of possible\nabuse/neglect allegations pertaining to Child A in the grandmother’s home. That as\nof 11/8/2021 information requested pertaining to multiple allegations of possible\nabuse/neglect in the grandmother’s home had not been provided. The only\ninformation provided was that there were three complaints.\nThe LGAL reported DHHS-WW reported to the court on 10/20/2021 Child A’s mother\nand Relative O were suspects related to the complaint incidents, but DHHS-WW\nnever informed her that Relative O was a suspect related to Child A’s bruises,\npossible abuse/neglect incidents. The agency did not alert her there had been prior\nincidents of concerns in Relative O’s home until the LGAL received a call from New\nYork.\nOn 11/12/2021 I spoke with Administrator 1, Supervisor 2, Program Manager 3, and\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 4 via a TEAM’s video contact. I also received email\ninformation from Administrator 1 on 11/16/2021. These staff advised that the LGAL\nwas apprised of the past allegations pertaining to possible abuse/neglect related to\nChild A in Relative O’s care by the AAG at court and via the agency’s court report for\n10/20/2021.\nFCW 4 reported there were a total of three allegations that came to light. One on\n10/6/2021 which she became aware of on 10/8/2021 related to a bruise on Child A’s\nforearm. Another on 10/8/2021 that she learned about on 10/11/2021, which came\nto light when Child A had been taken to the doctor for assessment related to the\n10/6/2021 one. The 10/8/2021 allegation reportedly related to a scratch on Child A’s\neye that reportedly had occurred back in August 2021. New York was investigating\nthe issues; did not report the child being at risk or a need for Child A’s removal from\nRelative O’s home at that time. FCW 4 reported they did not become aware of\nallegations of Child A having a black eye until 10/25/2021. New York reported\nnoticing the black eye during Child A’s parenting time/visit at the office on\n10/22/2021. New York also noticed Child A having a bruise to his chin. Child A was\ntaken to the doctor on 10/22/2021. New York reported the birth mother, the birth\nmother’s boyfriend and Relative O were all possible suspects; and New York had\nopened an investigation.\nAdministrator 1 reported the agency was informed by New York of an allegation on\n10/6/2021 and the LGAL was provided the information related to the allegations on\n10/8/2021 by the AAG at a court break session. It was FCW 4’s intention to relay\n9",
    "this information to the LGAL which FCW 4 had received in the evening of 10/7/2021.\nHowever, an email was received from the AAG that the AAG had informed the LGAL\nduring a court break session earlier in the day on 10/8/2021. Additionally, the LGAL\nattended the court hearing on 10/20/2021 in which those allegations from 10/6/2021\nwere reviewed, along with it being included in the court report for 10/20/2021 court\nhearing. Administrator 1 reported the new allegations against the grandmother that\ncame out on 10/22/2021 have also been provided to the LGAL. She reported they\ndid not convey that information to the LGAL earlier. These matters were discussed\nat the TDM 10/28/2021, which the LGAL was invited to attend, which the LGAL was\naware they would be discussing Child A’s placement stability. Administrator 1\nreported at this point, they have shared all information that they have received from\nNew York Children Protective Services regarding all allegations. They have also\ndeveloped a plan to provide consistent updates to the LGAL moving forward in an\neffort to improve their communication with her.\nReviewed\nChild A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n Social work contacts entries by Supervisor 3 and FCW 4 on 10/6/2021 about\ntelephone calls with a New York worker and New York CPS supervisor,\nrespectively by each. The former call was of New York reporting allegations of\npossible abuse or neglect after observing a bruise on Child A’s right forearm\nduring an unannounced visit at Child A’s school on 10/04/2021. The latter\ncontact by FCW 4 was follow up on the information reported by Supervisor 3.\nAdditionally, of DHHS-WW advising New York of their prior parent/child\nvisitation and safety planning conducted around Child A’s approved\nunsupervised visit with his mother. Also of New York advising that New York\nwould complete an investigation on the complaint which would take 60 days;\nand that a Child Safety Conference would be scheduled in the coming days.\nThat New York agreed to contact DHHS if Child A had any other marks or\nbruises.\n A 10/14/2021 and 10/20/2021 social work contact by FCW 4, documented as\na weekly video conference via Google Duo with Child A and Relative O after\nthe reports of new allegations of abuse and neglect were received (the\ncontacts did not clarify what date the stated new allegation was received).\nThe social work contact noted: During the video contact FCW observed Child\nA playing and observed fading marks on Child A’s right forearm at the\n10/14/2021 contact. FCW 4 saw Child A playing and observed a small mark\non Child A’s forehead on 10/20/2021. Relative O reported Child A was\noutside playing with his toys, was running and ran into the gate. Relative O\nreported no concerns, Child A was continuing his services; Child A was\nscheduled to complete a supervised parenting time visit with his mother at the\nNew York children service office on Friday on 10/22/2021.\n A 10/25/2021 social work entry for a telephone call from New York’s CPS\nsupervisor. The social work contact noted: The CPS supervisor advised of\nChild A arriving an hour late for his scheduled supervised parenting time with\nhis mother at the New York Children Service office. That during that office\n10",
    "contact the New York worker and Child A’s mother noticed that Child A had a\nblack eye and additional bruising on his arm that was not present at the last\nface to face visit with him.
