    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection\nDescription (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was placed at Vista Maria from 05/17/2022 to 08/04/2023.\nThere are concerns for medical neglect and failure to provide\nyouth’s medication for type I diabetes mellitus, resulting in risk of\nmedical emergency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Youth’s\ndiabetes care was previously at Mott and was transferred to\nChildren's Hospital of Michigan in June 2022 when youth moved\nto Vista Maria. Youth’s A1C was 9.6 at the time of last visit with\nMott in 5/2022. Youth returned to Mott on 8/26/23 with an A1C\ngreater than 14%, which shows an average blood glucose of\ngreater than 355 for the past 3 months (maybe longer) while\nresiding at Vista Maria. The caregivers report they were given\nexpired and incomplete diabetes supplies and medications when\nthey took over youth’s care. Additionally, youth did not have any\nhelp or supervision with diabetes care.\nInvestigation This complaint was received on 09/06/2023 and assigned for joint\ninvestigation with MDHHS Specialist.\nI interviewed Complainant/Hospital Social Worker via telephone on\n09/07/2023. She reported Youth A was previously a patient at U of M\nbut was transferred to Children’s Hospital last year. Youth A has now\nbeen transferred back to U of M since her change in placement. She\nreported there are concerns in reference to Youth A's A1C being 14\nwhen it should be at 7.\nI spoke with MDHHS Specialist 1 via telephone on 09/07/2023. She\nreported MDHHS Specialist 2 completed a well-being verification on\nYouth A at her current foster home placement by MDHHS Specialist\non 09/06/2023.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Worker (FCW) on 09/13/2023 via\ntelephone. FCW reported Youth A was placed at Vista Maria for\napproximately 1 year and on 08/04/2023 she was moved to a relative\nplacement. On 08/04/2023 FCW transported Youth A to her relative\n2",
    "placement, at which time Youth A was provided with 30-days of\nmedical supplies and medication. All the medications were current\nand there were no missing or expired medication or supplies. On\n08/30/2023 Youth A was moved to a licensed foster care home. FCW\nsaid it was while Youth A was at the relative placement her diabetes\nwas not being managed correctly. FCW said while Youth A was at\nVista Maria, the facility was following up with the diabetic clinic at\nChildren’s Hospital and there were never any concerns regarding the\nfacility not providing Youth A with supervision in managing, testing\nher glucose, or taking her prescribed medication. Youth A was never\nhospitalized while placed at Vista Maria.\nI interviewed Youth A via telephone on 09/13/2023. Youth A has\nbeen at her current placement for two weeks. She was previously\nplaced at Vista Maria and while at Vista Maria she was testing her\nblood sugar and taking her insulin medication daily. The nurse and\nsupervisor monitored her when she tested and took her medication.\nYouth A reported she was seen by a doctor at Children’s Hospital,\nand they did change her dosage because her sugar level was\nrunning high. She denied missing or not taking her medication while\nat Vista Maria. Youth A said her sugar levels have been lower since\nbeing at her current placement.\nI interviewed Nurse at the facility on 09/15/2023, in collaboration with\nMDHHS Specialist 1. Nurse has been employed at the facility for five\nyears and is the Health Service Manager. She reported Youth A was\nplaced at the facility for one year and at the time of placement she\nwas trained by U of M team in reference to Youth A’s diabetic care.\nShe was trained on medication management, testing blood sugar,\ncarb count, checking for ketones, and what to do if glucose level is\ntoo high or too low. She then trained the staff who administrate and\nmonitored Youth A testing and medication. Youth A’s A1C, and\nglucose level did run high while at the facility, but Youth A was\ncompliant with testing and taking her medication. Youth A’s glucose\nwas tested four times a day and was being reported to the diabetic\nclinic at Children’s Hospital by email weekly. The diabetic team\ndetermined the insulin level and emailed the nurse. Youth A would\ntest her glucose level while being supervised by Nurse or the\nsupervisor, and based on the glucose level and her carb count they\nused the chart to determine the dial on her insulin pen. Youth A was\nnot on a restricted diet, but Youth A was being monitored and\nencouraged to eat healthy foods and smaller portions. Nurse said\nwhen Youth A was discharged from Vista Maria, the relatives were\nprovided with medication, insulin pens, Humalog, Lantus, needles for\npens, emergency items for low blood sugar, Dexcom information,\nand the contact number for the medical supply company.\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 09/15/2023, in collaboration with\nMDHHS Specialist 1. Staff 1 is a team leader and has been\nemployed at the facility for three years. Staff 1 works first shift and\nwas trained on Youth A’s glucose testing and medication dispensing.\nShe reported Youth A was compliant with testing and taking her\nmedication. She said based on her glucose level and carb intake,\nthey used a carb count chart to determine how much insulin Youth A\nneeded to take, and if her glucose was too high, they would check\nher ketones and contact the nurse. Youth A tested her sugar four\ntimes, and the readings were entered in the computer and monitored\nby the nurse. She said Youth A’s sugar levels were high and thinks\nthat Youth A was sneaking food from the school and not reporting\neverything that she eats.\nI interviewed Therapist at the facility on 09/15/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist 1. Therapist was also trained by U of M\ndiabetic clinic in reference to Youth A diabetes care at the time of\nplacement.
