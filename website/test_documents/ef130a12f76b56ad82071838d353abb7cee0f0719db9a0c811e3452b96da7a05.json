    "DHHS Worker 1 does not have findings.\nDocuments:\n• DHHS Worker 1 provided her interview with Youth A which\nincluded Youth A was interviewed by DHHS Worker 1 on\n2/26/24 at the Ingham Academy. DHHS Worker 1 provided\nthe interview to this consultant. Youth A reported he did not\nhave an inappropriate relationship with Staff 1 and Staff 1\ndid not kiss him or provide additional snacks to him.\n• There are no incidents, notes or case notes pertaining to\nthe allegations.\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. All training and\nclearances are up to date. There are no disciplinary action\nin her file. Staff 1’s last performance evaluation was\nmarked as “exceeded expectations.”\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s Facebook page and there were no\nsocial media contacts to Youth A\n• I reviewed the card from the Hyacinth House Flowers. The\ncard states, “Happy Valentines Day! XOXO Soul Mate,\nFrom Lon.\n• I reviewed the Professional Boundaries Policy which\nconcluded staff are not to engage in friendship relationships\nwith youth, unauthorized contact with youth via social\nmedia, face to face contact outside of facility, or encourage\npersonal relationship outside facility.\nAnalysis Based on the interviews with supervisors and staff, it appears\nrumors began in late August/September concerning Staff 1 and\nYouth A. All interviewed did not suspect the rumors to be true but\ndid not stop the rumors from occurring. Based on the interviews,\nStaff 1 told the appropriate personnel when she heard of the\ninformation, yet supervision did not put a stop to the rumors.\nSupervisor 1 reported this is normal behavior for the facility and\nolder staff appear to “haze” staff. There is insufficient evidence to\nvalidate Staff 1 violated the agency’s Professional Boundary’s\nPolicy.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTechnical Assistance was provided concerning staff culture and\nsupervision responsibility. Administration will want to address the\nconcerns surrounding inappropriate rumors and false accusations\nwith their staff. The agency was also advised to record allegations\nlike these in case notes or incident reports, including the ways it\nwas resolved.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n3/12/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
