The alleged violations would have\ntaken place while Kalamazoo DHHS carried case responsibility.\nAn internal complaint was filed to open a new investigation.\nParent A – Parent A filed the initial complaint on 9/25/2023\nnaming a different agency. Phone interviews were scheduled with\nParent A, through email exchanges. Calls were made at the\nagreed upon time, but she did not answer on 10/6/2023 or\n10/10/2023. Parent A did return the missed call on 10/10/2023\nand left a voicemail stating she was available the remainder of the\nday. A return call was made within 30 minutes, but she did not\nanswer. On 10/11/2023 Parent A sent an email requesting\ninterview availability for that day which was provided to her along\nwith a request for her to call when she was available. She has not\nresponded.\nThe only available information from the complainant is what she\nwrote in her online compliant which stated the following:\nThe Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C were not placed with\nconsideration of their parents and communities’ proximity to\nthe home as they were placed in Galesburg (21 miles\naway) and Centerville (35 miles away).\nChief Administrator - On 11/9/2023 an email was sent to Chief\nAdministrator informing him of the allegations and requesting the\nnames of the staff who were assigned at the time the alleged\nviolations would have occurred. He replied on 11/13/2023 stating\nFoster Care Worker and Supervisor were assigned the case;\nhowever, Foster Care Worker no longer works for the agency and\nSupervisor now works for a different division of the department.\nHe added that neither he, nor the current program managers were\n2",
    "in their current roles at the time of the alleged violations, so they\nwould not have any knowledge of what occurred.\nFoster Care Worker - On 11/9/2023 a search of the state\nemployee directory was conducted. It was verified that Foster\nCare Worker no longer works for the department.\nSupervisor- On 11/27/2023 Supervisor was interviewed by\nphone. She reported she did not recall much about the case but\nreviewed the case record which documented the youths were\nalready placed in their respective foster homes at the time she\nwas assigned.\nDHHS Specialist – On 11/20/2023 a search of the state\nemployee directory was conducted, and it was determined DHHS\nSpecialist no longer works for the department.\nLicensing Supervisor – The Licensing Supervisor who worked\nfor the agency at the time the youths involved in this complaint\ncame into care no longer works for the agency; however, she still\nworks for the department, so she was contacted via email. She\nresponded she remembers the family involved in this investigation\nand participated in several meeting at the onset of this case and\nprovided the following timeline of events regarding removal and\ninitial placement of the youths:\n• 10/4/2021, a licensed home was identified for placement of\nall three youths. A plan was made to place all three in that\nhome as the priority was to keep the siblings together.\n• 10/4/2021-10/5/2021, all three youths were AWOL.\n• 10/5/2021, the youths were located at school and\ntransported to the identified foster home. When they\narrived, the foster parents indicated they thought Youth B\nwas a younger child and they didn’t realize his diabetic care\nwas so extensive.\n• Licensing Supervisor was contacted by DHHS Specialist\nregarding a new search for placement of Youth B.\n• Licensing Supervisor’s team conducted an extensive\nplacement search and located a family able to provide for\nYouth B’s medical needs, so he was placed in that home,\nwhich was 12 miles from Parent A’s address, not 21 as\nstated in the complaint allegation.\n• Youth A & Youth C remained in the home they were\noriginally placed since the home that could provide for\nYouth B’s needs could not take all three siblings and the\n3",
    "agency made the decision to at least keep the two siblings\ntogether.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nThe following is documented in the electronic case record:\n• 10/4/2021 phone conversation with paternal grandmother\nwho expressed interest in placement; however, reported a\nhistory of DHHS involvement.

A home was found\nwilling to take placement of all three children. When it was\ndetermined that family could not provide for Youth B’s medical\nneeds, a home was located for him within 20 miles of his parents’\nhome.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404 Placement\nSection (4) An agency shall consider all of the following factors in selecting\nDescription an appropriate placement for a child:\n(b) the physical, emotional, and educational needs of the child\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not take into consideration the youths' educational\nneeds when making placement decisions.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant – An internal complaint was filed; therefore, there is\nno Complainant to interview.\n4",
