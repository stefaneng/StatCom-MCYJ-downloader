    "10/12/2021 Contact – Document Received\nExchanged emails with CRO.\nALLEGATION:\nOn 8/22/21, staff member was attempting to restrict youth's movements in the hall by\nusing their arm to block. This was described as a push. Staff members were verbally\ninappropriate towards youth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was transferred for investigation on 08/24/2021. The facility reported\nthe following to Centralized Intake:\nYouth A (16) is a permanent ward who is placed at Vista Maria. Staff 1 and Staff\n2 are staff members at Vista Maria. On 08/22/2021, Staff 2 was trying to restrict\nYouth A’s movement in the hallways. Staff 2 used her arm to block Youth A from\ngoing towards the doorway. Youth A said this was a push, but it was not\naggressive. Staff 2 told Keona, \"No matter where you go, you will not be\nsuccessful.\" Staff 2 made a comment towards Youth A saying, \"I can't wait to\ncome back to this building to take other clients out on outings and I am not taking\nany disrespectful clients with me.\" Also, on 08/22/2021, Staff 1 was directing\nYouth A to complete a chore. Youth A told Staff 1 to shut up and told her that she\nwould beat her ass. At some point, Youth A said to Staff 1, \"You're not my mom.\"\nStaff 1 said to Youth A, \"I am not your mom, I am not trying to be your mother, I\nfeel sorry for your mother.\" It is unknown if Staff 1 is aware that Youth A’s mother\nis deceased.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 08/26/21. Youth A reported that Staff 2 asked\nher to do a chore that Youth A had already done, so Youth A began arguing with\nStaff 2. Youth A said that Youth B was present. Youth A said that Staff 2 was saying\nthat Youth A was not going to make it when she went to her new program and that\nStaff 2 couldn’t wait to come back and take kids on outings but leave Youth A there.\nYouth A said that Staff 3, who is a supervisor, was also there and Youth A wanted to\ntalk to Staff 3. Staff 3 was leaving the area, so Youth A said that she tried to follow\nher. Youth A said that Staff 1, who was also in the room, put her arm out and pushed\nYouth A. Youth A said Staff 1 and Staff 2 were laughing so Youth A threw a chair at\nStaff 2 because she was mad. Youth A said that Staff 3 came back in and “grabbed”\nYouth A and told her to go to her room. Youth A said that she didn’t want to go. A\nmale staff came to the area and also told Youth A to go to her room, and Youth A\nsaid that she was then able to walk to her room. Youth A said that Staff 3 just held\nher by her arms and did not report any injuries. Youth A also reported that Staff 1\ntold Youth A that she’s not Youth A’s mother. Youth A denied that any staff made\nany other comments about Youth A’s mother.\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 at the facility. The Consumer Rights Officer (CRO) was present\nfor the interview with the permission of Staff 1. Staff 1 recalled the day of this\nincident. Staff 1 reported that Youth A had done chores (swept floors) earlier in the\nday and was then asked to resweep the floor later on. Staff 1 said that Youth A “blew\nup” and yelled at Staff 1. Staff 1 said that Youth A told her that she’s not Youth A’s\nmother. Staff 1 said that she replied, “I never claimed to be your mother.” Staff 1 said\nthat Youth A added on to that and said something like, “You know my mom’s dead,\nright?” Staff 1 said that Youth A escalated from there. Staff 1 said that she\nconfronted Youth A on how she was changing what Staff 1 had said. Staff 1 reported\nthat Staff 2 and Staff 3 were present. Staff 1 denied saying anything negative about\nYouth A’s mother or that she felt bad for Youth A’s mother. Staff 1 said that she did\nnot put hands on Youth A or restrain her. Staff 1 didn’t recall any physical contact\nwith Youth A. Staff 1 said that Staff 3 did end up holding Youth A as Youth A\nescalated and then walked her off to her room.\nA conference call was held with involved parties to Youth A’s case, including Youth\nA’s worker, and the Placement Collaboration Unit, on 08/30/21. The complaint and\nupdates were provided and discussed.\nI interviewed Youth B at school on 09/21/21. Youth B said that she did not hear any\nstaff make comments about Youth A’s mother. Youth B said that she did hear a staff\nsay, “I’m not trying to be your mom” in response to Youth A saying, “You’re not my\nmom.” Youth B denied hearing any staff say any negative comments like in the\nallegations.\nI interviewed Staff 3 at the school on 09/21/21. The Consumer Rights Officer (CRO)\nwas present for the interview with the permission of Staff 3. Staff 3 reported that\nYouth A was upset over chores and Youth B ended up doing the sweeping. Staff 1\nand Staff 2 were reportedly redirecting Youth A, as was Staff 3. Staff 3 said that she\nalso reminded Youth A of upcoming rewards for chores and proceeded to leave the\nroom. After leaving, Staff 3 said that she heard a noise and went back in to find\nYouth A threw a chair at staff. Staff 3 said that Staff 1 put her arm out to stop Youth\nA from going toward the door. Staff 3 said she held Youth A, “not restrained, just\nheld her back.” Staff 3 said Youth A was not struggling. A male staff came to assist,\nand they talked to Youth A before walking her to her room. Staff 3 said Youth A\nwalked on her own and noted her room was just outside the living area where the\nincident occurred. Staff 3 said that she held Youth A by her arms because she was\nnot calm enough to let her go and she felt she couldn’t let her go until she was\ncalmed down. Staff 3 confirmed that the facility uses the Crisis Prevention Institute\n(CPI) model for restraint and that she is not supposed to hold a youth by herself.\nStaff 3 again said that she was not “restraining” Youth A, but just “holding her back.”\nStaff 3 denied saying or hearing any other staff say things like Youth A would be\nunsuccessful when she left the program. Staff 3 reported that Youth A told Staff 1\nshe’s not her mother, and Staff 1 responded by saying that she was not trying to be\nher mother. Staff 3 denied saying, or hearing any staff say that they felt sorry for\nYouth A’s mother.\n4",
    "I interviewed Staff 2 via phone, on 09/21/2, with the CRO was present. Staff 2\nreported a consistent account of what occurred, as reported by the other staff. Staff\n2 said that she did hear Staff 1 say something like she didn’t claim to be Youth A’s\nmother. Staff 2 said that Youth A responded to Staff 1 by saying something like,\n“How could you say that when my mom is dead.” Staff 2 said that Youth A and Staff\n1 then argued back and forth. Staff 2 said that Staff 3 was leaving the area and Staff\n2 went to close the door, when Youth A threw a chair at her. Staff 3 came back in\nand gave Youth A a sort of hug to get Youth A to calm down. Staff 1 called for\nassistance and the male staff came. Youth A then deescalated and walked to her\nroom. Staff 2 denied saying or hearing any staff make the remarks from the\nallegations, such as, not taking Youth A on outings, Youth A not being successful, or\ncomments about feeling sorry for Youth A’s mother.\nDuring this investigation, the CRO stated in email and conversation that he had\nalready done some coaching with Staff 3 related to her holding Youth A in the\nmanner she did. Per the CRO, even though it seems Staff 3 held Youth A out\nconcern of the present risk at the time, that single person hold is not provided for in\nthe CPI techniques taught at the facility. The CRO also confirmed that neither Staff 1\nnor Staff 3 have any related disciplinary action in their employee files. The CRO\nreported that Staff 2 “did have a disciplinary action for unprofessional demeanor\nwhen a client threw a pencil sharpener in January of 2021. This was the only I saw\nin her file in relation to this type of behavior.”\nA review of the video of this incident showed the following:\nThe video starts at 1:23.22 with a view of the living area where Youth A was seated\non the windowsill, Youth B was sweeping, and Staffs 1, 2, and 3 were in the area.\nStaff 3 left the area and Staff 2 was about to close the door when Youth A got up\nand went toward the door. Staff 2 closed the door and Youth A grabbed a chair and\nthrew it at Staff 2. Staff 1 approached Youth A, who backed up, and Staff 3 came\nback in the room. Youth A went to walk toward the door and at about 1:25:08, Staff 1\nput her arm out in front of Youth A. Youth A grabbed on to Staff 1’s arm and then\npushed Staff 1 away from her. Youth A lost her balance as she tried to kick Staff 1\nand fell to her knees, catching herself on a table. Youth A got up and started walking\ntoward Staff 1, who was backing away from the youth. Staff 3 walked behind Youth\nA and at about 1:25:16, held Youth A by her arms/bicep area. Youth A struggled a\nlittle bit with Staff 3, but not excessively. Staff 2 approached and appeared to be\nassisting, but Youth A jerked her hands away from Staff 2. Staff 3 turned Youth A\naway from Staff 1 and continued to hold her arms. Staff 1 and Staff 2 continue to\nmove about the area. Staff 3 holds Youth A standing near the wall. Staff 1 returned\nto talk to Youth A, which appeared to agitate Youth A. Staff 1 walked back out of\nYouth A’s line of sight. At about 1:31:18, a male staff entered the area and talked to\nYouth A. Staff 3 continued holding Youth A by the arms, but Youth A was not\nstruggling with her. When Staff 1 approached Youth A again, at about 1:31:38,\nYouth A swung around and was again held back by Staff 3. The male staff and Staff\n2 stepped between Youth A and Staff 1. Staff 1 continued talking to Youth A, which\n5",
    "appeared to agitate Youth A. Staff 1 walked away and the other staff continued to\ntalk to Youth A. Staff 3 continued to hold her arms. Staff 3 then walked forward to\nprompt Youth A to walk. They stop and talk for a bit and then slowly walk off camera\nwith Staff 3 still holding Youth A’s arms at about 1:33:21.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(a) Any type of corporal punishment inflicted in any\nmanner.\n(c) Verbal abuse, ridicule, or humiliation.\nANALYSIS: The facility is compliant with the rule. There was no pushing\nobserved on the video review. The staff put her arm out in front\nof Youth A, in an attempt to stop her from going to the door.\nYouth A’s response was escalated and her attempt to push\naway from the staff and kick staff appeared to be what caused\nher to fall. There was also no support of the allegations of verbal\nabuse/ridiculing comments by staff.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe facility did not follow their physical management model.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, a review of the video was completed, and it\nwas observed that Staff 3 held Youth A by her arms/bicep area. This action is not\nprovided for under the facility’s physical management model, CPI.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand procedures regarding restraint. These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their families,\nand referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as the act of one staff\nholding the youth from behind by the youth’s arms/bicep area is\nnot a technique provided for in the facility’s approved restraint\nmodel, CPI. CPI requires a two person hold and with each staff\nsecuring one arm. It should be noted that this restraint was not\negregious in any manner and did not appear to require the use\nof much force to secure the youth, however, the staff must\nfollow the approved methods outlined in their policies.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\nOctober 12, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 14, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"

    "summary": "The investigation found that while the specific allegations of staff pushing a youth and making verbally abusive comments were not substantiated by video evidence or witness accounts, a violation was established because a staff member improperly restrained a youth by using a single-person hold not permitted under the facility's approved Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) physical management model. The facility was found non-compliant with restraint policies and is required to submit a corrective action plan. The report concludes that the facility, not an individual staff member, is culpable for the policy violation related to improper restraint technique.",

  "sir_violation_level": {
    "level": "severe",
    "justification": "The substantiated violation involved the use of a physical restraint technique (a single staff member holding a youth by the arms/bicep area) that was not part of the facility's approved Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) model. This falls under the 'Restraint and seclusion' category for severe SIRs, as it represents an incident suggesting excessive force or unsafe de-escalation practices due to the deviation from the approved safety model."
