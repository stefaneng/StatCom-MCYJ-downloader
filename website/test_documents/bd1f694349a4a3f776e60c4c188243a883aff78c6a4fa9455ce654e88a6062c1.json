    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Noncompliance with visitation plan.\nInvestigation Allegation was made the agency was not cooperative in complying\nwith the visitation plan for Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C.\nInterviews:\nI made three attempted contacts (twice on 9/2/25 and once on\n9/3/25) with Respondent Mother. Messages were left requesting\na return call, and no responses were received from Respondent\nMother.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator by phone on 07/01/2025.\nChief Administrator stated this is a Cass County case and\nprovided contact information for Foster Care Supervisor.\nI interviewed Foster Care Supervisor by phone on 07/01/2025.\nFoster Care Supervisor provided a possible contact number for\nRespondent Mother of Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C. Foster\nCare Supervisor also provided contact information for Foster Care\nWorker.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker by phone on 08/27/2025.\nFoster Care Worker reported the children were initially placed\ntogether 09/24/2024. Foster Care Worker stated Youth B was\nsubsequently placed separately from 10/16/2024 to 01/02/2025\ndue to Youth B's behaviors.

    "demonstrated inconsistencies of Respondent Mother meeting the\nexpectations.\nI interviewed Visitation Supervisor by phone on 09/02/2025.\nVisitation Supervisor stated she does not cancel visits, but\nRespondent Mother must text confirmation of a scheduled visit by\n8:00 AM on the day of the visit, or the visit will not occur.\nVisitation Supervisor described Respondent Mother as\ninconsistent in complying with the requirements for visits to be\ncompleted. Visitation Supervisor stated she does not cancel visits\nas she is not compensated when visits do not occur. Visitation\nSupervisor stated a visit was scheduled for the day I interviewed\nher, but Respondent Mother had not confirmed the visit by 8:00\nAM so the visit would not be completed that day. Visitation\nSupervisor reported historically, the children were upset and\ndisruptive when a visit was expected to be completed and\nRespondent Mother would not show.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed ISP and USP documents with identified completion\ndates of 10/22/2024, 01/16/2025, 04/14/2025, and 07/13/2025\nrespectively. Each of these plans included a visitation plan of\nweekly, 2 hours, community setting, and supervised.\nI reviewed some documentation from Therapist related to visits as\nfollows:\n6/24/25 – Respondent Mother no-showed her parenting time\n6/26/25 – Respondent Mother no-showed our individual session,\nlater stating that she’d gotten a new e-mail address but her phone\nwas broken, and she did not have the link to our session.\n7/8/25 – parenting time was cancelled due to Respondent Mother\nnot confirming ahead of time.\n7/9/25 – Respondent Mother no-showed our individual session,\nlater citing illness.\n7/29/25 – parenting time was cancelled despite Respondent\nMother confirming that she’d be there because the case aide\nreported that she was not at the agreed upon location when she\nwas supposed to be.\n8/12/25 - parenting time was cancelled despite Respondent\nMother confirming that she’d be there because the case aide\nreported that she was not at the agreed upon location when she\nwas supposed to be.\nI reviewed the court order dated 07/18/2025 and it states in part\nthe following:\n3",
    "Respondent Mother is not following through with parenting time\nand visits with her children are very sporadic.\nI reviewed a number of notes related to visitation compliance with\nsome of the documentation as follows:\n10/04/2024 Respondent Mother a no show for visitation\n11/02/2024 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n11/19/2024 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n12/17/2024 Respondent Mother 20 minutes late to visit.\n01/04/2025 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n02/01/2025 Respondent Mother was a no-show.\n02/04/2025 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n02/08/2025 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n02/10/2025 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n02/22/2025 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n03/01/2025 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n03/08/2025 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n04/01/2025 Respondent Mother did not confirm visit / visit\ncancelled.\n05/06/2025 Respondent Mother was a no-show.\n05/20/2025 Respondent Mother was a no-show.\nI also reviewed letters from Foster Care Worker to Respondent\nMother related to parenting time/visitation expectations and\nprocedures. These letters included the need for Respondent\nMother to confirm scheduled visits for them to be completed.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with Rule 421-1 per staff\ninterviews completed and documents were reviewed. The agency\nhas an acceptable visitation policy for compliance. There is\nadequate documentation to indicate the policies/procedures were\ncommunicated to Respondent Mother for Respondent Mother to\nhave and complete parenting/visitation times. Court Orders also\ngave the agency discretion in compliance with the visitation plan\nas determined by Respondent Mother’s level of\ncooperation/compliance.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n09/05/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 9, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n5"
