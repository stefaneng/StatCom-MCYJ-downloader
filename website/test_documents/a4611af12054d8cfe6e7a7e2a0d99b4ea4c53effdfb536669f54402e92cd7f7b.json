She reported because the girls will eat everything at\nall different hours of the day they will keep items upstairs that they\ndo not want the girls to access. Then when it is needed they will\nbring it down.

She said she will go to Sam's and take\nstaff with her. She reported they have been advised by a dietitian\non what foods to provide.\nStaff 2 was interviewed by telephone on 2/13/23. She reported the\nfacility has plenty of food but the girls are picky and choose not to\neat what is provided. She said the milk the facility provides is not\ngood and the girls do not like it.

    "On-site Inspections:\nThe DHHS Worker inspected the refrigerator and pantry while she\nwas at the facility on 1/31/23. She forwarded pictures showing a\nlack of food and milk in the refrigerator.\nAn unannounced on-site visit was completed on 2/1/2023 at 8am\nby this consultant. The Case Manager (CM) was present at the\ntime. The menu was viewed hanging on the refrigerator. The\nmenu start date was 1/30/23. No other menus were viewed. The\nmenu stated pears and Poptarts were for breakfast. The\nrefrigerator in the kitchen held 3 gallons of milk, dishes of\nleftovers, a mostly empty bag of salad, and yogurts. The freezer\nhad frozen meat and fries. On the counter were two baskets of\nfood which contained Ramon noodles, peanut butter, jelly,\npeanuts, tomato soup, rice, and beans. The pantry held cans of\nsoup, jelly, noodles, cereal, canned beans, canned vegetables, 1\nbag of hamburger buns and 1 loaf of bread. Basement freezer\nheld 2 freezer meals, many hot dogs, cranberries, various frozen\nchicken. CM reported today is their grocery shopping day. She\nstated she was not present for breakfast but said they would have\nhad canned pears. One youth was still in bed and no pears were\nlocated in the house. She stated maybe they were on the third\nfloor where the offices are. She said they keep some food items\nthere. She stated the youth do not have access to that floor. She\nreported CA is in charge of the menu and making the grocery list.\nShe stated the girls are allowed to have input in the menu. The 3rd\nfloor was not viewed as it was only brought up after this consultant\nfinished the tour and was leaving.\nAnother unannounced on-site visit occurred on 2/7/23. CA was\npresent for the visit. There were two menus on the fridge. One\nmenu was specifically for Youth B and a food plan for Youth C\nwho had recently been diagnosed as pre-diabetic. The refrigerator\nhad leftovers, yogurt, and eggs. There were small plastic jars of\nmilk for the girls to drink. CA stated when the girls drink their entire\nbottle of milk the staff can get them more milk. She said they did\nthis because one of the girls would dink out of the carton and the\nother girls did not like it. CA also stated they have begun to keep\ntrack of what the girls eat on the communication logs. CA showed\nthe food that was stored on the third floor. Mostly dry food and a\nbox of shelf stable milk was observed. CA reported the box of milk\nhad been at the facility when the DHHS Worker checked for milk\non 1/31/23 but she was unable to find it because it was in the back\nof the closet behind a box. The snack baskets on the counter were\nfull and included fresh fruit.\n10",
    "Another unannounced visit to the facility occurred on 2/14/23. The\nrefrigerator was full of food. The cupboards had supplies for\ncooking food, spices, and baking supplies. There was no\nmushrooms or fungus growing under the kitchen counter. There\nwas an up-to-date menu and Youth C's food plan on the\nrefrigerator. The snack baskets were full and included fresh fruit.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Weekly Menus: Various menus for the last 2 months were\nreviewed. The menus included all food groups and\nappropriate food items for the girls. All menus were\ncompleted and ran for a week.\n• Communication Logs: the logs indicated the youth were\neating a variety of food. Even when they refused the menu\nitems they were still eating other items. Those items were\nusually hot dogs and noodles and were chosen by the girls.\nThe logs were compared with the menus and the food\neaten by the girls on days they did not refuse were the\nsame as the menu items.\n• Pictures from 1/31/23: The DHHS Worker’s pictures were\nreviewed. The pictures did show a lack of food in the\nkitchen and a lack of variety of food in the pantry. There\nwas no milk pictured. None of the pictures were of the 3rd\nfloor pantry and refrigerator.\n• Pictures from LD: LD sent pictures late on 2/1/23 of the\nsnack baskets to show they had been restocked with fresh\nfruit. She also provided pictures of notes posted for staff on\na bulletin board telling staff to refill the snack baskets and\nmilk containers every day.\n• Receipts: Receipts from 4 different stores showing food\npurchased throughout the last month. Two of those receipts\nwere bulk food that was purchased. There were also two\nreceipts from the food bank. All receipts showed purchases\nof fresh meat, frozen meat, eggs, fresh fruit, cereal, and\nvarious other items. Receipts also indicated tissue and\nsoap were purchased.\n• Dietary Guidelines for Americans: the federal government’s\nmost recent dietary guidelines were reviewed. A\ncomparison of the guidelines and the facilities menus found\nthe facility is providing an adequate diet for the girls.\n• E-mail from Youth B’s Foster Care Worker on 2/8/23: Youth\nB did report to her that she did not like the food that the\nstaff cooked for them. She created a safety plan to ensure\nYouth B was getting enough food. In the safety plan the\nFoster Care Worker said she saw adequate food when she\nvisited the facility on 2/6/23.\n11",
    "• E-mails from Youth C’s Foster Care Worker on 2/8 and 2/9:\nYouth C indicated to her that they now have food but there\nhad been a lack of food previously. She was at the facility\nprior to seeing the allegations on 2/2 and saw fruit and\nbread on the counter. She also reported a contractor doing\nan assessment on Youth C saw staff bring in groceries on\n2/3. The contractor told the Foster Care Worker there was\nan abundance of hot dogs brought in as well as other food\nitems.\nAnalysis While the visits on 1/31/23 and 2/1/23 indicated a lack of food\nthere was enough food in the pantry and freezer to get the girls by\nuntil groceries were purchased on 2/1/23. Once the facility\nadministration was aware they did not have milk they went right\nout and purchased some. Interviews indicated the girls were not\ngoing without food but rather where being provided with food they\ndid not like. Further, interviews indicated the staff are not eating\nthe girl’s food.\nTechnical Assistance: Work with the girls to create a menu of food\nthey will want to eat, provide fresh fruit, and continue to document\nwhat the girls are eating on each shift.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that this facility’s license be unchanged.\n2/17/23\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n03/09/2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n12"
