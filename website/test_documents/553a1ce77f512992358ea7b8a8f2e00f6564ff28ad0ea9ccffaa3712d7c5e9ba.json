This facility does not have a DHS Contract, therefore Contract/Policy violation\ndoes not apply.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following area:\n Several of the forms used by the facility had missing information such as\nsignatures and dates. There were also general items missing which allowed\nthe form to look unfinished. This was discussed, along with the underlying\nreasons that this was occurring. The facility was open to suggestions on\nresolving this issue and understood that leaving sections of a form blank gives\nthe impression that it is not complete.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following area:\n The facility shared that they now have an individual with the responsibility for\ncompliance. We discussed methods of developing a compliance process to\nensure that all forms are complete, and all youth records are kept in\ncompliance.

After an in-depth investigation, the facility was\nfound to be in violation of Rule 400.4142 (Health services). The facility submitted a\ncorrective action plan which was approved on 5/14/2021.

It was documented that staff\nare still being trained with a plan to have this finished at the end of the month. They are\nstruggling to get staff to complete the review process as identified and this issue was\ndiscussed during this inspection. The use of the 3rd shift staff to help in his effort will be\nexplored by the facility. They reported still being in the process of attempting to hire\nmore staff through the use of “job fairs”.\nThe second CAP was in regard to their 2020 Renewal Inspection.\nAn unannounced on-site visit took place on 2/9/21.

They shared a\nbelief that the facility is meeting all of their needs and providing them support to make\nthe changes necessary in their lives. The report that staff are attentive to their needs.\nStaff interviewed report a strong desire to provide best practice to the youth and believe\nthe administration is support of this goal.

    "interviewed also report a strong desire to provide best practice for youth and a healthy\nenvironment for their staff.\nVII.
