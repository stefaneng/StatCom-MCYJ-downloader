INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12506 Education/vocational training/Employment\nSection\nDescription (1) An agency shall ensure that a youth in independent living is\nemployed full-time, actively involved in job training or continuing\neducation, or a combination of employment and education\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth has not been participating in school since August 2022 and\ninstead stays at the home using marijuana. The agency has not\naddressed this. Youth is also not employed.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 6/14/2023. He\nreported he is concerned about Youth A’s placement because\nthey report minimal information about Youth A at court hearings.\nYouth A has not been attending school since August, which the\nagency did not report to the court until the most recent hearing. He\nstated that the agency reported in court that Youth A was found\nsmoking marijuana in his room and that drugs were confiscated\nfrom him, so he believes Youth A stays home all-day using drugs\nrather than working or going to school.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed via video\nconferencing on 6/1/2023 and reported she is the supervisor\nassigned to Youth A’s case. She stated Holy Cross has case\n2",
    "responsibility for Youth A who is placed in one of the agency’s\nIndependent Living Plus (ILP) homes. She reported Youth A can\ncare for himself and has demonstrated independent living skills\nadequate to live on his own. She reported he participates in\nindependent living skills training/activities on a regular basis. She\nstated when he was initially interviewed for the program, he\ndeclined the program as he was living in Kalamazoo and did not\nwant to relocate to Saginaw. FCS reported the home in which\nYouth A was living in Kalamazoo was closing, so Holy Cross “did\na favor” for them and accepted Youth A into their ILP home.\nFCS reported the agency staff initially attempted to enroll Youth A\nin the local school district after moving to the ILP home, but they\nrequired him to participate in a credit recovery program due to his\nbeing behind in education. Agency staff did get Youth A into a\ncredit recovery program; however, that school required Youth A to\nundergo searches and wanding upon arrival, which is a trigger for\nYouth A. The school staff did come to an agreement that they\nwould not wand Youth A; however, they did it once after which he\nrefused to go back. Youth A does have the opportunity to attend\nthat school virtually, but he has not done so. FCS reported Youth\nA in enrolled in school but has not attended since October of\n2022.\nYouth A does not currently have a job but has applied and\ninterviewed at several local businesses. He has participated in\nMYOI and Michigan Works as well but is not currently doing\neither. She stated the agency staff have had many conversations\nwith Youth A and several FTM’s to discuss the need for him to\nattend school. FCS stated Youth A does not want to be in\nSaginaw and has stated on multiple occasions that he will go to\nschool and work once he moves back to Kalamazoo where he\nalready has a job lined up.\nFCS stated at Youth A’s last hearing, the Judge ordered that\nKalamazoo DHHS Monitor to find a placement for Youth A in\nKalamazoo. Youth A has an interview with an ILP home coming\nup and there has also been a supportive adult identified with\nwhom Youth A might be placed with soon.\nFCS reported that they are conducted an internal investigation\nregarding the allegation that Youth A is using drugs instead of\ngoing to school or working. She reported no staff have observed\nhim using any drugs or have caught him with any drugs on his\nperson. She stated there was another youth caught smoking\nmarijuana in the home and Youth A was present, but Youth A was\nnot observed to be using.\n3",
    "Independent Living Director (Director) was interviewed via\nvideo conferencing on 6/1/2023. She reported Holy Cross staff\nattempted to interview Youth A for their ILP program last summer,\nbut Youth A refused to participate. She stated Kalamazoo DHHS\n“called in a favor” when Youth A’s placement was closing and\nthere were no other placements available for him in the area at\nwhich time Youth A was interviewed again. Director stated Youth\nA was appropriate for the placement based on the paperwork\nprovided by Kalamazoo DHHS and Youth A’s interview, so he was\naccepted into the program in August of 2022. Prior to moving to\nthe ILP home, Youth A was attending school in Kalamazoo area.\nOnce moving to the home, an attempt was made to enroll him in\nthe local school district, but there was a concern related to his lack\nof credits. He was enrolled in credit recovery program at a\ndifferent school; however, Youth A did not attend. He was then\nenrolled in a different school. He dropped out of that school in\nNovember of 2022 then re-enrolled in January of 2023; however,\nhe has not actively attended since October of 2022. She reported\nYouth A has stated he will go back to school when he gets back to\nKalamazoo and refuses to attend local school.\nDirector stated Youth A is meeting the criteria to remain in the\nprogram per the agency’s ILP contract as he is participating in\nindependent living skills, is enrolled in school, and is actively\nseeking employment. She states Youth A has signed individual\nindependent living contracts agreeing to attend school or work.\nShe stated agency policy when a youth is not complying with their\nindividual contract is to hold a meeting with the youth to address\nthe concerns and hold an FTM/TDM to with the referring agency\nto discuss the concerns and placement preservation during which\na plan is put into place. Agency staff evaluate the youth’s progress\ntoward the plan. Director stated there are not any timeframes\nattached to the steps and there is nothing indicating at what point\na youth no longer becomes eligible for the program bases on their\nfailure to comply with school/work. She stated the agency staff try\nto support the youth and make every attempt to avoid removing\nthem from the program as many of the youth have nowhere else\nto go.\nDirector reported that Youth A spends a lot of time in his room\nmaking music and paying video games but there have not been\nany concerns about him using drugs in the home. She stated\nminimal information is presented in the courtroom due to concerns\nwith the parents having all of the information; however, all of the\n4",
    "information needed is documented in the court report presented to\nthe judge.\nYouth A was interviewed by phone on 6/2/2023. He reported he\nhas not gone to school “in a long time” but is starting summer\nschool as soon as he gets a start date. He stated that the ILP\nhome staff try to get him to go to school, but he hasn’t gone\nbecause he was forced to move to the ILP home and does not\nwant to be there. He stated that he was participating in Michigan\nWorks at the ILP home until February or March and can’t\nremember why he doesn’t anymore. He stated he has applied and\ninterviewed for jobs at several local restaurants including\nMcDonalds, Little Caesars, and Checkers, but has not been\noffered a job. He stated he is working on his independent living\nskills and that the staff are “doing their jobs” supporting and\nencouraging him to attend school and work. Youth A denied any\ndrug use.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via video\nconferencing on 6/5/2023.She reported Youth A began attending\nschool on 6/3/2023. She reported she has only been assigned to\nthe case since 4/1/2023 and Youth A has been enrolled in school\nthe whole time. She stated he has applied for jobs at Burger King,\nMcDonald’s, and KFC as well as other local businesses, but has\nnot been hired. She stated he was participating in Michigan Works\nweekly, but quite because he thought the woman running the\nmeetings was racist. FCW stated Youth A is in compliance with\nprogram expectations as he is enrolled in school and is applying\nfor jobs. She stated that there have been discussions at the\nagency about Youth A’s appropriateness for the program based\non his refusal to attend school, but there is nowhere else for him\nto go.\nFCW reported Youth A wants to be in Kalamazoo and reports he\nalready has a job lined up at a friend’s restaurant in that area. His\nKalamazoo DHHS monitor continues to try to get him into ILP\nhomes in that area; however, there have been no beds available.\nFCW was recently told a bed will be opening at an ILP home in\nKalamazoo in July and there has been a supportive adult in\nKalamazoo area who might be willing to take placement of Youth\nA.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n- ILP Contract which indicates the youth agrees to be\nemployed/volunteering or attending a school or\n5",
