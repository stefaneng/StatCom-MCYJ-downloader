    "• (d) Compliance with the licensing rules for foster\nhomes.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There is a concern that a licensing renewal report did not reflect\naccurate methods of discipline.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nFoster Parent was interviewed by phone on 1/14/2025. Foster\nParent stated Licensing Worker 1 came out to her home in June or\nJuly of 2024 to complete a renewal assessment at which time she\ntold Licensing Worker 1 the middle school youth she had in the\nhome was demonstrating behavioral issues, so Foster Parent was\n“putting her to work” doing things such as raking for about 30\nminutes at a time. Foster Parent told Licensing Worker 1 this was\nthe only thing that worked with that youth; however, the renewal\nreport just stated Foster Parent 1 keeps the youth busy as a form\nof behavior management and does not provide any details as to\nwhat that means. Foster Parent stated Licensing Worker 1 did not\ninterview any of the youths during the renewal inspection, so they\nwere not asked about discipline in the home. Foster Parent stated\nLicensing Worker 2 was completing a special evaluation on her\nhome during which the youths were asked about discipline used in\nthe home. Foster Parent was found in violation due to using the\nraking as a form of behavior management. Foster Parent stated\nLicensing Worker 1 was aware of this method of discipline, yet she\nnever told Foster Parent it was not acceptable.\nLicensing Worker 1 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n1/15/2025. She reported being a licensing worker for 9 years. She\ncompleted Foster Parent’s renewal home visit 7/10/2024.\nLicensing Worker 1 stated all youths were either at school or\ndaycare so Licensing Worker 1 only spoke to Foster Parent. She\nstated she asked Foster Parent about methods of discipline used\nin the home and Foster Parent stated she utilizes, “keeping the\nchild busy.” Licensing Worker 1 reported she interpreted that to\nmean doing activities. Licensing Worker 1 stated she asked Foster\nParent for clarification, but she does not recall how Foster Parent\nresponded. During a special evaluation on Foster Parent’s home,\nit was reported by the youths in the home that physical chores\nwere being used as discipline.\nLicensing Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing on\n1/16/2025. She stated she reviewed and approved Licensing\nWorker 1’s renewal inspection report. She stated it was in the\n2",
    "report that Foster Parent utilized keeping the youths busy as a\nform of discipline but there was nothing in the report alluding to\nthe use of physical chores as discipline. Licensing Supervisor\nstated she has already spoken to the licensing workers about the\nneed to ask follow-up questions when foster parents and youths\nprovide vague answers to questions in the future. Licensing\nSupervisor stated the use of chores as discipline came out during\nan investigation in Foster Parent’s home when it was disclosed by\nFoster Parent’s adult daughter, who lives outside of the home.\nLicensing Worker 2 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n1/16/2025. She stated, during a special evaluation on Foster\nParent’s home, she interviewed all 3 of the youths in the home\nwho talked about physical chores as discipline. She also spoke to\nFoster Parent who openly discussed the use of physical chores as\ndiscipline. Licensing Worker 2 stated Foster Parent lives in a\nheavily wooded area so there are always a lot of leaves on the\nproperty. She stated Foster Parent reported the youths will have to\nrake 1-2 hours for not more than 3 nights in a row for behavior\nmanagement. A safety plan was developed with her in which\nFoster Parent agreed to not making youths rake for more than 30\nminutes at a time as discipline and the youth’s assigned worker\nhad to be contacted regarding the use of raking as discipline.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n• 7/22/2024 Foster Home Reevaluation completed by\nLicensing Worker 1 and approved by Licensing Supervisor.\nUnder Section, the methods of discipline used by licensee\nstated, “use of communication, keeping the child busy,\ngrounding, and time outs.”\n• 12/6/2024 Special Evaluation Report completed by\nLicensing Worker 2 and approved by Licensing Supervisor\nin which concerns with Foster Parent’s use of sweeping the\ndriveway or raking leaves for “an excessive amount of time”\nfor the ten-year-old in the home.

Additionally, the kids will\nbe allowed bathroom breaks, breaks, and to eat.\nAnalysis A violation has been established as Licensing Worker 1 did not\nensure Foster Parent’s compliance with foster home licensing rule\n400.9404(3) by not asking Foster Parent or the youths in the\nhome for an explanation of keeping youths busy as a form of\nbehavior management. Additionally, during a special evaluation,\n3",

She\nstated the licensing worker previously assigned to Foster Parent\nretired, so the home was reassigned to Licensing Worker 1. Foster\nParent stated Licensing Worker 1 never responds to her texts or\ncalls, so she has to reach out to her supervisor who just tells\nFoster Parent Licensing Worker 1 is busy and/or in training. Foster\nParent stated Licensing Worker 1 is supposed to be working on\ndeveloping a CAP with Foster Parent 1 as a result of special\nevaluation findings. Foster Parent stated she agreed to completing\na psychological evaluations, counseling, and training as a part of\nthe CAP, but Foster Parent is requesting the training be virtual as\nopposed to in person due to Foster Parent’s busy schedule.\nFoster Parent stated Licensing Worker 1 told her if her schedule is\ntoo busy, maybe she shouldn’t be a foster parent rather than\nallowing virtual training.\nLicensing Worker 1 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n1/15/2025. Licensing Worker stated a special evaluation on Foster\nParent’s home was completed by Licensing Worker 2. Licensing\nWorker 1 has been trying to develop a CAP that resulted from that\nspecial evaluation, but Foster Parent initially stated she just\n5",
    "wanted to close her license. Licensing Worker 1 was attempting to\ncoordinate the CAP requirements with the requirements of a\ndifferent MDHHS investigation, but Foster Parent was not\ncomplying with those requirements. Licensing Worker 1 stated she\nhas been negotiating the CAP with Foster Parent by phone and\nthey agreed on the psychological evaluation and potential\ncounseling, but Foster Parent wanted to do training virtually.\nLicensing Worker 1 wanted the training to be in person so\nsomeone could physically evaluate Foster Parent’s progress.\nLicensing Worker 1 stated during an MDHHS Worker’s\ninvestigation, it came out that Foster Parent’s daughter was\nwatching the foster children most of the time due to Foster Parent\nbeing away from the home until 7:30-8PM. Licensing Worker 1\ntold Foster Parent that fostering might not be in her best interest\nbecause her schedule is too busy to allow her to be with the\nyouths and too busy to allow her to complete in person training.\nLicensing Worker 1 stated they eventually agreed on weekend in-\nperson training.\nLicensing Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing on\n1/16/2025. Licensing Supervisor reported also supervising the\nMDHHS staff who provides ongoing services as a result of a\nseparate investigation in Foster Parent’s home and Foster Parent\nwas refusing to participate in all services. The initial CAP\ndeveloped in response to the special evaluation completed by\nLicensing Worker 2 coordinated the other services provided, but\nsince Foster Parent was refusing those, Licensing Worker 1 was\nattempting to work with Foster Parent to develop a CAP she would\nagree to. Licensing Worker 1 talked to Foster Parent about\nparticipating in psychological evaluation and training, but Foster\nParent is quick to say she wants to close her license as opposed\nto completing a CAP. Licensing Supervisor stated Foster Parent\nreached out to her by email stating Licensing Worker 1 was not\nresponsive to her. Licensing Supervisor stated Foster Parent’s\nprior worker was an “over the top communicator” and Foster\nParent was used to at least weekly communication. Licensing\nSupervisor stated she doesn’t have any concerns with Licensing\nWorker 1’s communication with Foster Parent and Licensing\nSupervisor is now copied on all emails between Licensing Worker\n1 and Foster Parent, so she knows she is responsive and working\nwith Foster Parent.\nLicensing Worker 2 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n1/16/2025. She reported, in early December 2024, Licensing\nWorker 2 sent Foster Parent a copy of her reports and let her\nknow Licensing Worker 1 would be following up with her to\n6",
