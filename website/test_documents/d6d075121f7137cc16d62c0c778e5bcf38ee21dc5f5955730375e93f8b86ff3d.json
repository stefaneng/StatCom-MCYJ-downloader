INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection (1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\nDescription contact with children or parents to be a person who has the ability,\nexperience, education, and training to perform the duties assigned.\nViolation Type Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nAllegation The foster care worker and supervisor speaks inappropriately to\nthe birth parent and engaged in harassing behavior toward the birth\nparent. The supervisor has threatened to kill the birth parent if the\nbirth parent reports that the supervisor left her unsupervised with\nher child. Additionally, the worker has made harassing remarks to\nthe birth parent and laughed and called the birth parent mentally ill\nwhile on the phone with others.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nBirth Parent B\nOn 2/8/2023 after numerous attempts to contact Birth Parent B/the\nComplainant, I interviewed her by telephone. Birth Parent B\nreported Foster Care Worker (FCW) 4 is the worker on her child,\nChild A’s case. Supervisor 3 is FCW 4’s supervisor. Birth Parent B\nreported, FCW 4 and Supervisor 3 have not treated her well. They\nhave not put her interest forward in court and have threatened her.\nShe said FCW 4 is very hostile in visits; FCW 4 has slammed\n2",
    "doors, made threats toward her, and been very aggressive when\nspeaking to her. FCW 4 said Birth Parent B will her children back\nas long as she is the worker. Birth Parent B said during one of her\nparenting visits FCW 4 came in the visiting room playing music,\ntalking loudly on the phone and FCW 4 made a joke about Birth\nParent B’s disability. Birth Parent B could not recall the actual joke.\nShe said during another time someone came into the visitation\nwhile she was with family, the person pointed at her and made a\npoint of saying Birth Parent B is mentally ill. I asked Birth Parent B\nwhether that person was FCW 4. Birth Parent B said that was\nanother worker, but Birth Parent B did not identify the worker. She\nsaid it is FCW 4 who is always inappropriate with her or is on the\nphone with FCW 4’s family members making jokes about her. She\nsaid the worker should not be talking about her having a disability\nand should not be slamming doors.\nAs to a staff threatening to kill her, Birth Parent B reported that was\nSupervisor 3. She reported, the threat happened once during one\nof her parent/child visits that Supervisor 3 was supervising.\nSupervisor 3 had to leave the visiting room but did not have or ask\nsomeone else to come in to sit on the visit. Supervisor 3 left the\nroom for about five minutes; and before Supervisor 3 left the room,\nSupervisor 3 threatened her. Supervisor 3 told her “You better not\ntell I left you in this room or I’ll kill you.” Birth Parent B admitted\nthere was another worker nearby who could see into the visiting\nroom. She said all that person did was closed the curtain or\npartition that separated the two visiting areas.\nI asked Birth Parent B whether she thought the reported statement\nfrom Supervisor 3 was a serious threat to kill her. Birth Parent B\nstated she didn’t know. She also stated, “I just think she did not\nwant it known that she left the room”. She said Supervisor 3 also\nthreatened her by saying “I better stop telling these White people\nabout things about her (Supervisor 3).” Birth Parent B reported\n“the white people and things” meant, the Children Ombudsmen\nOffice and complaints Birth Parent B has made to them and\nAdministrator 2. Birth Parent B said Administrator 2 has been\nchecking on her concerns and plans to meet with her. Birth Parent\nB did not know when that meeting was to occur.\nChief Administrator 1 & Administrator 2\nOn 2/8/2023 I had a TEAMS conference with Chief Administrator 1\nand Administrator 2 related to the complaint allegations. I also\nspoke with Chief Administrator 1 onsite on 2/10/2022.\n3",
    "These administrators reported they are trying to work with Birth\nParent B who sends Administrator 2 emails and texts daily about\nissues she has about her case. Both administrators indicated it is\nBirth Parent B’s pattern to express many concerns; and she tends\nto make outlandish claims.\nAdministrator 2 reported Birth Parent B has expressed concern\nwith Supervisor 3 because Supervisor 3 has sat in on some of the\nparent/child visitations. Birth Parent B has expressed concern\nabout Foster Care Worker (FCW) 4 related to visitations\ninteractions, remarks she alleged FCW 4 has made to her, and an\nissue related to Child A’s hair. Administrator 2 said she will be\nmeeting with Birth Parent B on Friday (2/10/2023) to address Birth\nParent B’s reported concerns about the case, with the stated foster\ncare staff persons, and ones she has related to Child A’s father,\nParent D.\nChief Administrator 1 nor Administrator 2 reported a concern that\nthe allegations against Supervisor 3 and Foster Worker 4 have\nvalidity. To their knowledge there were no reporting from others\nthat either staff had acted inappropriately with parents.\nSupervisor 3 and Foster Care Worker (FCW) 4\nI interviewed Supervisor 3 and FCW 4 onsite on 2/10/2023.\nSupervisor 3 denied the allegations against her. Supervisor 3 said\nshe has been nothing but kind to Birth Parent B. She has never\nmade fun of Birth Parent B’s disability; nor would she. She said\nBirth Parent B does have mental health issues; and currently Birth\nParent B is not addressing those, despite the agency referring Birth\nParent B for a number of services.\nSupervisor 3 reported she may have had her computer while\nsupervising a parenting time with Birth Parent B; but she has never\nbeen on the phone during those times. Supervisor 3 denies\nthreatening Birth Parent B or telling Birth Parent B she will kill her.\nNot jokingly or otherwise. She reports encouraging “this young\nparent”. Supervisor 3 admitted there was at time during her\nsupervision of a parenting time that she left the room for less than\nfive minutes. She had to get a diaper for the child. The father had\nnot brought any; and there was no one else was around to step into\nthe room. Supervisor 3 said she and Birth Parent B had a good\nconversation about why she had to step away and she thought\neverything was okay. Supervisor 3 said, in hindsight she realizes\nshe should have taken the child with her.\n4",
    "Supervisor 3 reported Birth Parent B is the one who has made\nthreats to others. Birth Parent B has two children in care now, and\nBirth Parent B has had her rights terminated to other children in the\npast. Birth Parent B has threatened Wolverine staff, who\nsupervises her son, Child C’s case. Birth Parent B has even\nthreatened the judge on the case. She said, Birth Parent B\nconstantly complains about different issues and makes allegations.\nBecause of Birth Parent B’s constant threats and calls/ contacts to\nthat agency workers, at one point Wolverine was directing all\ncommunication with Birth Parent B to the supervisor. Birth Parent\nhas also made many complains to South Central’s administrative\nstaff about her case. Additionally, Birth Parent B tries to\nantagonize her son’s father with little acts, but Parent D tries to\navoid her.\nSupervisor 3 reported as far as FCW 3’s interactions with Birth\nParent B, she has never observed FCW 4 behaving unprofessional\nor in an inappropriate tone or manner with Birth Parent B. She has\nnever observed FCW 4 to make threatening actions to Birth Parent\nB. She said, FCW 4 knows when to engage with Birth Parent B,\nand when FCW 4 needs to back off.\nFCW 4 affirmed information reported by Supervisor 3 related to\nhistory of the case, Birth Parent B’s tendency to make complaints,\nand Birth Parent B’s interactions with Parent D and Wolverine.\nFCW 4 denied the allegations against her. She reported during\nparent/child visits she is working. She said if her personal phone\nwas to ring she would step aside to answer it. She has never\nspoken to one of her family members about Birth Parent B. Nor has\nshe made a joke at Birth Parent B’s expense, laughed at Birth\nParent B or slammed door. Nor has she ever observed Supervisor\n3 to do those things, or to harass or be disrespectful to Birth Parent\nB.\nAnalysis Based on interviews, there is insufficient evidence to support the\nallegations; or that Supervisor 3 and FCW 4 did not have the\nability, experience, education, and training to perform their\nassigned duties.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\n5",
    "development, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Type Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nAllegation The agency worker has lied in court reports, has taken photos of\nthe birth parent’s child's hair pulled out of her head, and has\nrefused to provide the photos to the court. Additionally, the worker\nand supervisor have interfered with the birth parent’s visits as\nordered by the court.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nBirth Parent B\nBirth Parent B reported when it come to her case, FCW 4 and\nSupervisor 3 do not put her concerns in court reports. They also\nsay she is not engaging with her child and that she is on the phone,\nwhich is not true. Birth Parent B said she knows there are camera\nin the visiting room that will show she’s not. She said she does not\nhave a problem with FCW 4 and Supervisor 3 telling her they “want\nme to do more bonding with my child. Am okay with that. I just\ndon’t want it said I’m on my phone when I’m not. And put it in a\nreport like am constantly on the phone when I’ve only done so a\ncouple of times”. Birth Parent B reported the times has been on\nthe phone were times she was talking with her family about Child\nA. She said if the agency does not want her on the phone, they\nshould tell her that.\nBirth Parent B reported her other concern is that agency is doing\nnothing about the fact that Parent D is 30 minutes late bringing her\ndaughter to parenting times; and Parent D is picking her daughter\nup late from the visits. Additionally, that Child’s A hair is being\npulled out by someone. Birth Parent B said she believes Parent\nD’s girlfriend does Child A’s. Birth Parent B noticed bald spots on\nChild A’s head and has asked the agency to investigate that. She\nsaid at the last parenting visit, FCW 4 asked Parent D what\nhappened with Child A’s hair; and Parent D reported that Child A is\npulling her hair out. Birth Parent B does not accept that, she thinks\nsomeone is pulling Child A’s hair out. She said there are photos\nwhich were taken of Child A's head where Child A’s hair is missing\nbut FCW 4 would not show those photos to the court.\nBirth Parent B admitted that when Parent D is late for her parenting\ntime the agency allows her to have the extra parenting\ntime/minutes. She said this was also addressed by the judge in\ncourt on 1/31/2023. The judge spoke to both Parent D and Parent\nB about timeliness and missed visits. Birth Parent B said she’s\n6",
    "okay with that. She said, her concern is Parent D’s constant\nlateness and who is doing Child A’s hair. I asked her whether the\nagency has discussed her doing Child A’s hair during her parenting\ntime; and she admitted they had.\nI suggested Birth Parent B explore this and other concerns she has\nabout the case with the agency when she meets with Administrator\n2.\nChief Administrator 1 & Administrator 2\nOn 2/8/2023 I had a TEAMS conference with Chief Administrator 1\nand Administrator 2 related to the complaint allegations. I also\nspoke with Chief Administrator 1 onsite on 2/10/2022.\nAdministrator 2 advised that Birth Parent B has two children in\ncare. Both children are placed with their respective fathers; but\nBirth Parent B tends to focus only on her daughter, Child A, which\nthis complaint makes references to. Birth Parent B has insinuated\nChild A’s hair was “snatched” out. Administrator reported Birth\nParent B seems to be trying to get the court to remove Child A from\nParent D. The hair issue was addressed in court at a hearing on\n1/31/2023. Administrator 2 said Parent D does have a habit of\nbeing late bringing and picking Child A up for/from parenting times.\nParent D may also need to learn how to better care for Child A’s\nhair, but FCW 4 has not expressed any concerns with Parent D\ntaking care of Child A. Administrator 2 said Child A’s hair is\nthinning, there has been some breakage, but that appears to\nnatural, maybe from laying on those sides, not as a result of a\ndeliberate act to Child A’s hair being snatched out. She\nacknowledged that there were photos taken of Child A’s head\nwhere the breakage appears, but Administrator 2 was not sure if\nthe photos were reviewed/shown at court. She said the worker and\nor supervisor could better speak to that. She reported there has\nbeen discussion at court about Birth Parent B doing Child A’s hair\nduring the two-hour parent/child parenting time, and that will be\nencouraged.\nSupervisor 3 and Foster Care Worker(FCW) 4\nI interviewed Supervisor 3 and FCW 4 onsite on 2/10/2023.\nSupervisor 3 reported no awareness of any court reports\ncontaining untrue information. She denied that being the case for\nreports she reviewed and signed off on. She said with respect to\nthe parenting visits she has supervised, Birth Parent B engages\nwith the child/children; is not on the phone. Supervisor 3 did not\nrecall a lack of engagement by Birth Parent B with her child, or a\n7",
    "report of her being on the phone being indicated in the court\nreports. She believed Parent D’s lateness to the parenting visits\nwas included. She said Parent D was late to the last parenting visit\nshe supervised. She addressed that with Parent D; and Parent B\nwas given an extra 30 minutes. She advised that Parent D gets a\nride to the office, and so he may be 5-10 minutes late. She\nadmitted he has also been at least 30 minute late picking Child A\nup from the visit. This has also been addressed with him.\nSupervisor 3 acknowledged the court had instituted special\nprovisions around Birth Parent B’s office parenting time visits. In\nthe past Birth Parent B, was to call the agency by 8:00or 8:30am to\nreport she was coming for the 10:30am visit. That was when\nWolverine was involved pertaining to Child C. Now Birth Parent B\nmust call the agency the day before to report she plans to attend\nthe visit. No other special provisions are in place; and the agency\nencourages Birth Parent B to follow the court’s recommendations.\nAs for FCW 3 interactions with Birth Parent B during the\nparent/child visitations, and general interaction with Birth Parent B,\nSupervisor 3 has observed some of those interactions. She has\nnever observed FCW 4 behaving unprofessionally or inappropriate\nin tone or manner with Birth Parent B..\nFCW 4 reported she has never submitted court reports with false\nstatements. She said Birth Parent B does try to engage with her\nchildren, but Birth Parent B focuses more attention on her\ndaughter, Child A, than her son, Child C. She said Birth Parent B\nbeing on her phone seems to be related to Birth Parent B focusing\non her GPS. Birth Parent B tries to track Parent D. FCW 4 denied\nputting that type of information in the court report. She said, Birth\nParent B sent emails all times of the day or night about multiple\nthings. She said if she was to put all those things in her court\nreports the report would be very long.\nFCW 4 reported as it relates to allegations of Child A’s hair\npossibly being snatched out, she has no proof of that being the\ncase. She said, on 1/27/2023 while Birth Parent B was doing\nChild A’s hair, at parenting time she noticed Child A has some\nareas of hair missing. Birth Parent B noticed it also. Child A had\nextensions, and the missing hair was around the edges. FCW 4\nwas not concerned that anyone was snatching out Child A’s hair.\nShe knows wearing extensions can pull on the hair, bring about\nhair breakage in areas. She said she took a picture of Child A’s\nhead/hair during that parenting visit. Her intention was to give it to\nthe court. She still plans to do so. She showed the picture to her\nsupervisor; and he also spoke with Child A’s dad, Parent D about\n8",
    "proper hair care. FCW 4 said this matter would not have been in\nher last court report because the court report had to be completed\nand submitted to the court 10 days before the court date, which\nwas on 1/31/2023. She said, Birth Parent B brought this issue up\nat that court hearing. FCW 4 explained to the court what she had\nexplained to Birth Parent B about the hair coming out due to the\nextensions wearing and possibly a lack of proper Black hair care.\nFCW 4 was unable to show the court the photos on her cell phone\nbecause she lost all the photos on her phone and the issue was\nnot rectified until after the 1/31/2023 court hearing.\nFCW 4 denied that she or any other agency staff has interfered\nwith Birth Parent B’s parenting time or what the court ordered. She\nsaid both Birth Parent B and Parent D have been late for parenting\ntimes. Supervisor 3 addressed Parent D’s lateness with the\nparenting visits. FCW 3 said she has tried to make up visits for\nBirth Parent B, but many times Birth Parent B will say she has to\nwork. FCW reported not knowing whether Birth Parent B is being\ntruthful about that, because Birth Parent B has not been\ncooperative by verifying her work schedule.\nDocument Review:\n• Child A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n➢ Child A (age 2) entered care on 9/10/2020 due Birth\nParent B previously having two children terminated\non and having untreated mental health issues which\nput her child at significant risk of harm.\n➢ Child A was made a temporary court ward on\n7/17/2021. She has been placed in the care of her\nfather, Parent D since 9/23/2021.\n• Viewed a copy of the photo taken of Child A’s head/hair\nwhich showed an image as described by FCW 4.\n• Child A’s last two court reports of which I could not discern\nwhether they had incorrect information.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and information reviewed there is insufficient\nevidence to support the allegations, or to show the agency workers\ndid not work directly with the child, the family, and other relevant\nindividuals related to the service plan and implementation\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n9",
