The facility created a new file for the youth when they switched from\nUC to URM status. The facility made the start date of the youth's first service plan\nunder their URM file the date when the youth's URM status began, rather than a\nconsecutive date from the youth's most recent service plan. This practice resulted\nin a service plan not being completed every 90 days as required. This is the\nfacility's practice for all youth who switch from UC to URM status. This issue was\nalso addressed in the facility's 2024 Interim report.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nInterim Inspection Report dated 3/5/24; CAP approved 4/5/24\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• If the facility is going to continue using the MDHHS-69 Action Summary as the\ndischarge report when youth are discharged from the program, the facility must\ncheck the box for \"Foster Care Case Closure\" and must complete all case\nclosure narrative sections on the form to be in compliance with Rule 166.\n• If a youth has an unplanned discharge from the facility, the information written on\nthe \"discharge notification\" report sent to ORR must be the same information\nlisted on the MDHHS-69 Action Summary discharge report.\n• The facility should develop a process for youth who switch from UC to URM\nstatus and remain at the facility. Although the facility recognizes a youth's change\nin status as two different cases, licensing does not. If the youth does not leave\nthe facility and live elsewhere, the youth is not considered discharged, and\ntherefore the youth's case file, and service plan report dates, should be\ncontinuous.",
    "• Staff who write case management reports for youth at the facility must be listed\non the staff list provided to DCWL during annual licensing audits.\n• Job references cannot be completed by a staff's \"spouse/esposo\" as they are\nconsidered a relative.\n• The facility should develop a process to ensure discharge plans are being\ncompleted for discharged youth. This should include a process for providing a\nsummary on unplanned discharges.\n• The facility has stated more than once the reasons for some of these non-\ncompliances are because they are meeting ORR requirements, but not\nconsidering licensing requirements. To maintain licensing for this facility under\nthe State of Michigan, licensing rules must be followed regardless of any\ncontractor requirements.\n• The facility's new hire orientation requirements must be clearly documented and\nconsistent. Four different new hire curriculums were found on new employee's\ntraining transcripts. It is imperative new employees are provided with uniform\norientation requirements to ensure consistency for youth and staff.\n• If the \"new hire curriculum\" listed on a new employee's training transcript\nincludes the 16 hours of required orientation as referenced in Rule 128,\nsupervisors must ensure new hire curriculum is in \"completed\" status and not \"in\nprogress\" status on staff training transcripts prior to the staff having contact with\nyouth.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Section one of the CWL-4607-CCI Chief Administrator Report should include a\ndetailed review and assessment of the institution's compliance with licensing\nrules, rather than a list of the violations found during the last annual audit.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nOne CAP was a result of the facility's 2024 interim inspection.
