There are 50 children and 8 staff total. The youth\nbeing serviced have various mental/physical health issues and some are sexual\npredators with access to younger youth. Supervision is compromised and upper\nmanagement has been unresponsive to this issue for up to a year.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was transferred for investigation on 10/11/21. The complaint noted\nthe following,\nThere is not enough staff in the facility. There are 50 children and 8 staff all\ntogether. The children in the facility have various mental and physical health\nissues. Some of the children are highly sexual predators with access to younger\nchildren. This continues to happen where there is not enough on campus.\nYesterday the same thing happened. The upper management is not answering\nthe phone or returning calls. This has been going on for the last 6 months to a\nyear. It has gotten worse in the last 30 days.\nI interviewed the complainant via phone on 10/11/21. The complainant reported\nsome concerns that have been investigated outside of this investigation and are not\nduplicated in this report. Complaints related to staffing a youth at the hospital on the\nweekend of 10/09/21-10/10/21, and that there was no supervisor on duty for the\nsame weekend were investigated in SIR 2022C0108003. The complainant reported\nthat they worked both days the prior weekend, 10/09/21 and 10/10/21. These were\nthe first days back to work for the complainant after six months. The complainant\n4",
    "reported working at the facility for about six months and was laid off. The\ncomplainant said that she filed a grievance with the union and was brought back to\nwork on 10/09/21. Upon return to work the complainant said that they were short\nstaffed both days that weekend in Stoner cottage. The complainant said that they\nwere the only staff there upon arriving at 10:30am on 10/09/21. Upon arrival, the\ncomplainant said Staff 3 was alone with seven kids and after Staff 3 left, the\ncomplainant was left alone with all seven. The complainant reported that other\ncottages had sufficient and extra staff that could have been used in their cottage.\nThe complainant said that when they returned to work on 10/10/21 they were again\nalone with seven or eight kids. The complainant said that they made the\nadministration move some kids to another cottage so that they would be in ratio of\none staff per four youth. The complainant said that it was the Director of Children’s\nServices who began moving youth as the complainant was late coming in to work.\nThe complainant said, “It’s a mess over there” and said that they are not disgruntled\nbut fed up with the facility doing “whatever” to the staff and not protecting the\nresidents. When asked if the complainant had spoken to the Director of Residential\nServices (DRS), the complainant said that the DRS was fired the week prior. The\ncomplainant said that since she just returned to work, she doesn’t know all the staff,\nbut knew Staff 2 came in on 10/9/21 “for a while” because she forgot something and\nstayed with the complainant for a while. The complainant also said that Staff 2\nworked on 10/10/21 at 3:00pm.\nThe complainant called again on 11/08/21 and reviewed the issues of concern. The\ncomplainant reported that no additional staff were sent to the cottage on 10/09/21.\nThe complainant said that she was working alone on 10/10/21 until about 2:30 or\n3:00pm when Staff 2 came in. The complainant said that she was terminated on\n10/15/21 because the facility said she left from her assignment to staff a youth at the\nhospital.\nI visited the facility on the following days and checked for compliance with staffing\nand ratio. One of the six cottages is having renovations done and not in use. The\nfollowing is what was observed:\n 10/12/21-I toured the five occupied cottages, and all were in ratio. Youth were\non the playground and were observed to be in ratio.\n 10/21/21-I toured one cottage, Ott, and they were in ratio.\n 10/27/21- I toured the five occupied cottages and all were in ratio. Youth were\non the playground and were observed to be in ratio.\n 11/10/21- I toured the five occupied cottages and all were in ratio.\nI interviewed the Director of Clinical Services at the facility, on 10/21/21. The\nDirector of Clinical Services (DCS) said that he was an on-call administrator for part\nof the weekend and spoke with the complainant, who is a staff at the facility. The\nDCS said he spoke to the complainant about 16 times due to a situation that\noccurred with youth truancy and the DCS coordinating for the complainant to go up\nto the hospital to monitor a youth. The DCS said that he was also in contact with the\nSupervisor that weekend during this incident. The DCS said that the complainant\n5",
    "was worried about being held over at the hospital as they have another job, so the\nDCS and Supervisor got coverage for the complaint to be relieved. The DCS said\nthat the complainant was upset because she had to go monitor the youth at the\nhospital.\nI interviewed the Director of Children’s Services at the facility, on 10/21/21. The\nDirector of Children’s Services said that she was the on-call administrator for part of\nthe weekend and received a call from Staff 3 who was asking who was coming in to\nrelieve him as the complainant had called and said she was going to be late. The\nDirector of Children’s Services called other cottages to see who was working and\nbegan moving youth and staff around to ensure staffing ratios were in compliance.\nThe Director of Children’s Services said that she planned out the adjustments and\nthey would have ensured compliance with ratio. The Director of Children’s Services\nalso came on campus on 10/10/21 from about 4:00pm through 8:00pm to assist as\nthey were short supervisors for the campus (addressed in SIR 2022C0108003). The\nDirector of Children’s Services said that the complainant was not the only staff\nworking in the cottage on 10/10/21 and reported that Staff 2 came in as well.\nI interviewed the Supervisor at the facility, on 10/21/21. The Supervisor said that, on\n10/09/21, he was on campus and worked from 11:00am-11:00pm. On 10/09/21, the\nSupervisor reported that he moved some youth from the complainant’s cottage to\nensure ratio because the complainant was initially out of ratio with about eight youth\nand only herself there. This was resolved when the Supervisor arrived and moved\nsome youth. The Supervisor was not scheduled, nor on-call, for 10/10/21, but came\nin to assist during an emergency. On 10/10/21, he took another staff up to the\nhospital to relieve the complainant.\nA PCU phone conference was held on 10/25/21 that included numerous\nrepresentatives for the residents at the facility. Some participants voiced concerns\nrelated to staffing and other issues, while others reported no concerns with staffing\nlevels. I advised that if there were specific licensing complaints unrelated to the\ncurrent staffing and ratio complaint being investigated, for those complaints to be\nreported.\nComplainant 2 emailed on 10/27/21, to advise that Youth J is not being supervised\nby the facility during his visits with his mother, as required, due to lack of staffing.\nComplainant 2 said that Youth J has visits with his mother, whose parental rights\nhave been terminated. This is allowed per the youth’s trauma assessment. The visits\noccur every other Saturday at Methodist and the case manager agreed to ensure\nadequate staffing to supervise the visits. Per Complainant 2, Witness 3 reported that\ntwo recent visits between Youth J and his mother were on campus but not\nsupervised by staff. Witness 2, who is Youth J’s foster care worker, requested\nvisitation reports from the facility and Youth J’s Family Transition Coordinator\nindicated that Youth A and his mother are not actually being supervised as\nrequested. Complainant 2 forwarded an email from the Family Transition\nCoordinator to Witness 2 regarding the supervised visits. In part, the email noted the\n6",
    "following, “I have not been able to supervise the last two personally as I typically do\nnot work weekends. We do not have extra staff on weekends so the on-call\nsupervisor observes the interactions, when possible, but they are also responsible\nfor any other crises that may occur on campus, so they are not able to provide a\ndetailed report.”\nI interviewed Youth J at the facility on 10/27/21. Youth J reported that the last two of\nthe three visits he has had with his mother have not been supervised by the facility.\nOn 11/16/21, the Director of Children’s Services reported the following, via email,\nrelated to the supervised visits.\nTo my knowledge all of Youth J’s visits with his Mom were supervised. The FTC\nsupervised the first visit and had reached out to the FC Worker after the visit\nupdating her about how it went and asked whether visits needed to continue to\nbe supervised (because the visit went well and phone contact was no longer\nsupervised). The FC worker said that she wanted the next couple of visits to be\nsupervised and if those went well then they could be moved to unsupervised. At\nthe next couple of visits Youth J and his Mom were outside and were within\nstaff’s line of sight.\nThe Director also reported in a subsequent email on 11/17/21, that the Supervisor\nsupervised the visits on 10/02/21 and 10/16/21.\nI interviewed Witness 3 via phone on 11/22/21. Witness 3 reported that visits\nbetween Youth J and his mother were not supervised on 10/02/21 or 10/16/21. The\nmother reportedly spoke to the Supervisor, but the mother and Youth J walked\ncampus together but did not have a staff with them or near them. The mother had to\ncall the on-call number to get someone to let her in a building to use the restroom on\n10/02/21, as no one was around. Reportedly, the mother is concerned as her visits\nare supposed to be supervised and she doesn’t want to get in trouble with the court\nif the facility is not doing what they are supposed to do.\nI met with the Director of Residential Services (DRS) on 11/10/21 and exchanged\ninformation via email throughout this investigation. The DRS provided copies of staff\nschedules for the weekend noted in this complaint. Specifically, the Stoner cottage\nwhere the complainant alleged ratio was not followed was verified for compliance.\nThe DRS updated the schedule and reported that she confirmed it was accurate with\nthe human resources department and the shift reports. Documentation was also\nprovided related to youth being on home passes during that weekend, for\nconfirmation of ratio compliance.\nI interviewed Staff 2 via phone on 11/22/21. Staff 2 confirmed that she worked\n10/09/21 from 11:00am-7:00pm, and 10/10/21 from 6:30am-10:30pm. Staff 2\nreported that she “thinks we were in ratio,” noting the Supervisor moved some kids\nand staff around to maintain staffing ratios. Staff 2 reported that since she has been\nthere (two months) that she has not worked out of ratio.\n7",
    "I met with the Chief Administrator at the facility on 11/23/21, and the complainant’s\nemployee file was reviewed. A notice of indefinite layoff was in the file and dated\n04/16/21 due to the complainant’s assigned cottage closing and the limited\navailability of open shifts. The Chief Administrator reported that the complainant did\nnot work for the facility at the time this occurred, but she confirmed with Human\nResources that the complainant did not want to work in the available cottages with\nshift openings, so she was laid off. There was also a notification of administrative\nleave in the complainant’s file, dated 10/15/21. The complainant was put on unpaid\nadministrative leave pending an open investigation. The Chief Administrator reported\nthat the investigation was internal and related to the complainant reportedly being\nverbally aggressive and insubordinate with the Supervisor and the Director of\nClinical Services on the weekend of 10/09/21-10/10/21. This investigation was noted\nto still be with the Licensee Designee for review. Finally, the 180-day performance\nevaluation for the complainant from her original hire date was reviewed. It was dated\n05/06/20 and noted that she “meets requirements” in all areas except for\nattendance.\nI interviewed the Supervisor via phone on 12/01/21. The Supervisor verified that he\nwas asked to supervise visits for Youth J and his mother in October but clarified that\nhe was told that Youth J and the mother could be in the common area outside of the\ncottages as long as they were in line of sight. The Supervisor said that he was told\nhe did not need to be sitting with them or within sound of the visit, but could not\nrecall who told him that, although he thought it was the Family Transition\nCoordinator. The Supervisor said that he was the on-duty supervisor those days and\nattending to other things, and there were no extra staff to assign to monitor the visit,\nso he would look out at Youth J and his mother but was not continuously present for\nthe visit. The Supervisor said that he was first asked to supervise the visit in the\nFairman cottage but told (whoever it was) that it would depend on if they had enough\nstaff on the weekend to do so. Since this issue surfaced, the Supervisor said that the\nadministration addressed with the staff that supervised visits are to have an\nassigned staff within sight and sound of the visit.\nStaff schedules and email verification of youth on home passes were provided for\nreview. Specific to the weekend of this complaint and for the noted cottage, the\nfollowing was observed for 10/09/21. The schedule for 10/10/21 shows the facility to\nbe in ratio.\n Staff 3 worked from 8:30pm on 10/08/21 until 10:30am on 10/09/21. There\nwere eight youth in the cottage during this time.\n The complainant worked from 10:30am – 10:30pm on 10/09/21. There were\neight youth in the cottage on this day until noon, when one youth went on a\nday pass. At that time there were seven remaining in the cottage.\n Staff 2 worked 11:00am – 7:00pm.\n Two additional staff came in later in the day at 12:30pm and 4:23pm\nrespectively.\n One staff called in sick.\n8",
    "A list of residential employees was provided and noted 55 employees from the Chief\nAdministrator to part time contingent staff; 51 of the employees were designated\nsupervisors and direct care staff.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation as the evidence supports that there are\nnot always sufficient staff to provide for the needs, protection,\nand supervision of residents. In this case, Youth J was\nsupposed to have supervised visits, but the facility did not\nsupervise at least two of his visits.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2022C0108003, intake 10/11/21, CAP approved 11/16/21\nSIR 2020C0108009, intake 11/26/19, CAP approved 01/13/20\nSIR 2022C0207005, intake 10/25/21, CAP pending\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation as the evidence supports the allegation\nthat, on 10/09/21, the facility was out of ratio. Staff 1 reported\nthis, and the staff schedule provided by the administration\nshowed them to be out of ratio that morning.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2021C0207024, intake 07/20/21, CAP approved 09/22/21\nSIR 2021C0108045, intake 07/13/21, CAP approved 08/25/21\n(cited as a contract violation for ratio)\nSIR 2022C0207005, intake 10/25/21, CAP pending\n9",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\nDecember 01, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 1, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n10"
