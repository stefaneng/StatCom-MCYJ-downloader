    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth is being secluded to their room for all but one hour each\nday and this is expected to continue for the duration of youth's\nplacement.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via phone on 11/30/23. She\nreported having nothing more to add to the allegations and having\nnever observed Youth A in person. She also reported hearing\nabout Youth A being in Youth A’s bedroom for 23 of 24 hours per\nday from Probation Officer during a phone meeting. Probation\nOfficer said during the meeting that Youth A is in the bedroom 23\nof 24 hours a day because of Youth A’s behaviors.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via phone on 11/30/23.\nShe reported Youth A is on her caseload and currently lodged in\nthe facility. She also reported the facility is not equipped to provide\nthe services Youth A needs. There is no possible placement in the\nState of Michigan and the hope is Youth A will be placed in a\nfacility in Arkansas in a few weeks. Foster Care Worker believes\nYouth A is placed in the bedroom because this is the safest place\nfor Youth A at times in the facility. Youth A presents with homicidal\nand suicidal ideation and if not getting the attention Youth A is\nseeking, Youth A was acting out in a violent manner. Youth A is\nlodged on a charge of great bodily harm less than murder and has\na concrete plan to murder her family members. Youth A has also\nhad several charges for assault. Foster Care Worker views Youth\nA as very dangerous and the situation in the facility is providing\nthe best possible care at this time. Youth A was released from\nHawthorne mental facility 6 months ago after being there for two\nyears. Hawthorne deemed Youth A as safe thus Youth A was\nreleased. Foster Care Worker receives daily updates on Youth A\nand because Youth A’s needs are so high, believes Youth A is not\nbeing neglected. She also reported the facility Psychologist\nspends 90% of the time with Youth A and when out of the\nbedroom, three staff are present because of the past violent\nbehavior.\nAdministrator 1 and Administrator 2 were interviewed face to\nface at the facility on 12/1/23. Both reported Youth A is not\nlocked in the bedroom 24 hours a day. Youth A is going to the\nschool at the facility and allowed to engage in exercise activities.\nThe only time Youth A is in the bedroom is when Youth A\nbecomes dysregulated and begins to become assaultive towards\nstaff and other youth. The facility’s focus is to have Youth A out of\nthe bedroom as much as possible because, both reported it is\nworst for Youth A to be in the bedroom because the isolation\n2",
    "increases stress for Youth A. Both also reported Youth A is not in\nthe bedroom for punishment but rather for the safety of Youth A\nand others. Youth A is on Youth A’s own program because of the\nmental health issues Youth A presents and Youth A will do well for\nweeks at a time. Both believe Probation Officer may have\nmisspoken during the meeting Complainant was involved in.\nProbation Officer was interviewed face to face at the facility\non 12/1/23. When asked about the report of her saying Youth A is\nlocked in the bedroom 23 of 24 hours, she reported reading off an\nincident report of what the court ordered at one point but did not\nsay Youth A is locked in the bedroom 23 of 24 hours.\nPsychologist was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n12/1/23. She reported Youth A was involved in group with other\nyouth until issues began to occur. Youth A stopped cooperating\nand engaged in assaultive behaviors towards other youth and\nstaff. Youth A would take off Youth A’s clothes in the milieu and in\nfront of others. Since being moved to another “pod” Youth A has\navoided kicking and biting others and not engaging in self-harming\nbehaviors. Staff are providing hourly reinforcements to help Youth\nA get out of the bedroom and the goal is to reduce restraints.\nPsychologist also reported that beginning 11/20/23, Youth A’s\nbehaviors began to go downhill and this is documented in the\nincident notes.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 12/1/23.\nYouth A was out of the bedroom and reported feeling safe and\nready to be replaced to a treatment program. Youth A believed\nstaff are caring and attentive to Youth A’s needs. Youth A also\nreported being in the bedroom when acting out and views the\nbedroom time as not punishment.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nYouth A Modified Behavior Program 11/1/23. This document\noutlines the reasons for Youth A being placed on a modified\nbehavior program as repeated negative behavior/interactions,\nmultiple physical/verbal assaults, and multiple self-harm incidents.\nYouth A can earn points to be removed from this modified\nbehavior plan and points are to be tracked. Youth A will attend\nschool as Youth A’s behavior permits however, Youth A will not\nattend the class with equipment/tools present and not attend final\nschool block because of multiple threats/interaction issues. If\nYouth A’s behavior is appropriate Youth A can engage in\nprograming activities such as Music therapy, Bible study, Tai chi,\n3",
    "etc. Youth A is to shower each day as Youth A’s behavior permits.\nYouth A’s behavior will be reviewed each day.\nKalamazoo County Juvenile Home notes on Youth A from\nPsychologist dated 9/1/23 to 11/30/23. These notes cover the\ncontact Psychologist had with Youth A and the alert-levels Youth\nA was placed on. There is also documentation of the decision for\nthe alert-levels and documentation of Youth A progress and/or\nlack of progress during this time period. Throughout this time\nframe, Youth A remained mostly on Alert level blue indicating\nYouth A was considered to be at risk for self-harming or harmful\nbehaviors towards others. This restricted what Youth A could have\nin the bedroom and the level of supervision required. It is\ndocumented that at times Youth A would respond in a positive\nmanner and present as cooperative with staff and others.\nHowever, other times, Youth A would become violent and\naggressive towards staff and other youth or engage in self-\nharming behaviors. It is documented that often Youth A would\nengage in threatening self-harming behaviors or threatening harm\nto others. When not receiving a requested task, item, or level of\nattention Youth A believed should have been provided, Youth A\noften became dysregulated and engaged violence. The holding\narea in the facility was used when Youth A became significantly\nviolent or engaged in self-harming behaviors or threats. Often\nYouth A was moved from a pod to the holding area and after a\nshort time of cooperation, Youth A was removed back to the pod.\nIt is documented Youth A was under constant supervision and\nPsychological was present daily and sometimes for a significant\nlength of time. Youth A attended school and other activities as\nlong as Youth A was cooperative and not engaged in violent\naggressive threats or behaviors.\n9th Circuit court for county of Kalamazoo Family Division\ndated 11/27/23. This court report outlines the reasons for Youth A\nbeing lodged in the Juvenile Home and Youth A’s progress. Youth\nA is being provided one-on-one supervision by staff because\nYouth A has displayed behaviors stemming from past traumas\nand attention seeking behaviors. Youth A has made many\nstatements of self-harming and has attempted to engage in self-\nharming behaviors on several occasions. Youth A is placed in a\nvery strict program to ensure Youth A is safe. The plan is that\nYouth A will be transitioned to appropriate placement as soon as\nappropriate placement is found.\nSpecial Observation list of the Pods, there is no date on this\ndocument. This document outlines the different observation used\n4",
    "for youth in the program. Starting with the Standard Observation –\nGreen Alert, the next level is Blue Alert, then Yellow Alert followed\nby Red Alert. With each level of alert determined by the behaviors\npresented by the youth and involves a different level of\nsupervision. The behaviors that determine the level of alert involve\nself-harming behaviors (suicidal ideation or violent acting out\ntowards others).\nIncident Reports for Youth A from 8/31/23 to 11/28/23. During\nthis time frame, it is documented Youth A had 58 incident reports\nover 16 days. These incidents were the result of Youth A\nengaging in self-harming behaviors, threatening other youth and\nstaff, refusing directions, and attacking staff or other youth. Youth\nA was restrained during many of these incidents and placed in\nYouth A’s bedroom.\nRoom Observation Sheets Kalamazoo County Juvenile Home\nfrom 11/6/23 to 11/30/23. During this time period, Youth A was\nlodged in the bedroom as documented by the room check sheets.\nHowever, documentation indicates that with the exception of one\nday, Youth A was allowed out of the room to engage in different\nactivities such as school, therapy, showering, group involvement,\nand other activities. The facility is documented as making the\nrequired room checks on Youth A. The program, Youth A was\nengaged in involved being placed in the bedroom as a\nconsequence of negative behaviors such as threatening or\nattacking staff or other youth and engaging in self-harming\nbehaviors (threatened or acted upon). Documentation also\nindicates the focus is to remove Youth A from the bedroom when\nYouth A is cooperative and no longer dysregulated. The focus is\nto protect Youth A and others when Youth A becomes\ndysregulated.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews and written documentation there is no\nevidence that supports Youth A is locked in the bedroom 23 of 24\nhours per day. The facility has Youth A on a program that involves\nroom confinement for inappropriate aggressive behaviors with a\nfocus on getting Youth A out of the bedroom as soon as possible.\nWhen lodged in the bedroom, Youth A is supervised, has access\nto Psychologist, and the ability to engage in several different\nactivities as Youth A begins to become cooperative.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
