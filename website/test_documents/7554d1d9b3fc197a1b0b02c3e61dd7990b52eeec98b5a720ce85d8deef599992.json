    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The\nagency interim inspection was completed 7/8/2023. There was one\nnoncompliance with Rule 405(4) regarding the timely completion of change in\nplacement documentation. The CAP for this noncompliance was approved\n12/15/2023 by DCWL. This was not identified in noncompliance during the current\nrenewal evaluation. No areas were identified in noncompliance as a part of the\ncurrent renewal evaluation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. Identified barriers in\ncompleting the CAP were that both child welfare program managers resigned\nwithin hours of each other during the licensing period. They have also had foster\ncare and placement workers out on FMLA so there was concern that with these\nchanges some information may get overlooked through the process. The staff is\nalso continuing to work at becoming knowledgeable with the CWLM system. The\nstaff has utilized the share drive in the process of successfully completing the\napproved CAP.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable.\nStaff Interviews\nThe child welfare staff participated in entrance and exit conferences. Staff\ninterviews did not indicate any areas of concern other than those related to the\nstaff turnover.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, licensing and independent living services. All files were\nstored securely and there is a cross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes. It is recommended that the agency be issued a renewal of their\nregular license.",
