    "On-site Agency Visit-Interviewed Chief Administrator A, viewed\nclosed files- Preliminary Findings provided\n06/10/2022 Inspection Completed- Sub Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency has not submitted records to Michigan Department of Health and\nHuman Services (MDHHS) for permanent retention one year following the final order\nof adoption as required. There are two records that have not been submitted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/23/2022 I reviewed the complaint, and contact was made with the complainant\nvia email by my Peer Consultant. I made initial contact with the agency about the\ncomplaint via email on 5/24/2022.\nOn 5/25/2022, Adoption Departmental Manager (ADM) X provided information about\nthe complaint to me, and a Peer Consultant, via email. She reported her department\nhad been in contact with agencies about their closed adoption records. ADM X\nreported the department had inquired with the agencies as to the status of the\nclosed adoption files requested. Her department found that these files either had not\nbeen submitted to the local office at all or were submitted outside the required\ntimeframe of 12 to 13 months following finalization. ADM X listed two finalized\nadoption files for Catholic Charities of Southeastern Michigan that may not have\nbeen submitted.\nADM X provided clarity on how the files are to be closed and sent to the County\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) offices, and the DHS-788 form\nto be attached on the closed file boxes. Additionally, ADM X provided information\nwith respect to if an agency still has old closed adoption records outside the ones on\nthe list provided related to the complaint; and what that agency should do with those\nrecords. Whether those closed records should come to ADM X’s office or the\nCounty DHHS Office. ADM X reported, when R400.12713 was updated in 2015,\nagencies were instructed to send their backlogged adoption records directly to\nCentral Office. She reported, it has been seven years and at this point agencies\nshould be caught up, and on schedule to send closed records to the local offices\nbetween 12-13 months following finalization. If an agency still has old closed\nadoption records, her office will work with the agency, accept those old records, so\nas to not have the local county office bombarded with old records. She advised it\nwould be very helpful if the agency would include in any corrective action plan the\nagency’s plan to ensure that Lansing/the department gets those old records.\nOn 5/24/2022, via telephone, and 6/9/2022 via onsite visit, I interviewed Chief\nAdministrator A about the complaint. Chief Administrator A also provided\ninformation via email on 5/25/2022. Chief Administrator A reported the agency has a\nnumber of closed foster care and adoption records which have yet to be submitted to\nthe department. She reported the agency has 26 closed adoption cases from 2020\n3",
    "and approximately 26 from 2021 which are pending submission to the department.\nThe two closed adoption records connected to this complaint, Child 1’s and Child\n2’s, would be included in the former group. She reported no one had requested\nthese two specific records; that the agency had not received an email or letter\nadvising to submit these two records by a specific deadline. She provided a\n“Record Retention Verification form showing the submission of Child 1’s, Child 2’s\n(adoptions finalized 10/23/2020 and 10/30/2020 respectively) and 26 other closed\nrecords to DHHS- North Central on 5/31/2022. Thirteen of those cases were closed\nadoption cases; five of those had adoption finalization dates over one year (ranging\nfrom 5/19/2019-6/15/2020). Six others had adoption finalization dates in\n2021(ranging from 4/5/2021- 5/25/2021) and one was finalized on 4/21/2022.\nChief Administrator A reported the agency also has more than a hundred other\nclosed adoption records, which are ready for submission to the department, where\nthe adoption finalizations range between 2015- 2020. These records have not yet\nbeen sent. There are also hundreds of other older adoption closed records for 2014\nor older that they are working to box up (these are a mixture of domestic and foster\ncare adoptive cases). She reported there was some uncertainty as to where those\nclosed cases were to go. She said, Lansing will only take 50 boxes at a time.\nAdditionally, that there had been the question of what a closed adoption record\nshould consists of. Thus, clarity was needed on this so that their agency would get\nthe file content correct; and not have the closed record rejected. The latter of which\nChief Administrator A reported was implied, given remarks reported related to prior\nfiles submitted. She reported reaching out to the department, inclusive of ADM X\nand State Adoption Analyst (SAA)T in 2021 related to transferring 160 boxes of\nclosed records, because the agency was moving in August of 2021. I provided\ninformation to Chief Administrator A that ADM X shared with me about the content\nrequirement for closed adoption records, and where current closed, and older closed\nadoption records should go, some of which I mentioned earlier in this report.\nDuring my onsite visit I observed the agency’s secure storage for their closed\nrecords. I addressed the agency future compliance plan. Chief Administrator A\nreported the plan going forward to maintain compliance is that they will maintain a\nspreadsheet related to adoption finalization dates and adoption case closure\nsubmissions. Currently they are reaching out to each County DHHS office related to\nscheduling a drop off for finalized adoption files. They plan to have all outstanding\nadoption files dropped off by the end of July. Once they are current, they plan to\nsubmit the closed adoption files off on a monthly cycle, and to track them via their\nspreadsheet and Records Retention Verification form.\nReviewed\n A copy of an adoption file record’s list from Adoption Departmental Manager X,\nas referenced earlier in this report.\n A copy of a Record’s Retention Verification document showing 28 named records\nwere submitted to DHHS-North Central, as referenced earlier in this report.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12713 Adoption placement record.\n(5) The Michigan department of human services must\npermanently retain all adoption records for children\nadopted from Michigan's child welfare system. The\nadoption agency must forward any adoption records for\nchildren adopted from the Michigan child welfare system to\nthe department one year after finalization of the adoption.\nThe adoption agency may not retain the original copies or\nany other copies of the adoption records.\nANALYSIS: Child 1’s and Child 2’s adoptions were finalized on 10/23/2020\nand 10/30/2020 respectively. These two records were submitted\nto the department on 5/31/2022, more than the 12-13 months\ntimeframe required by the department.\nAdditionally, the agency has numerous other finalized adoption\nrecords which are beyond the 12–13-month submission\ntimeframe, which the agency has yet to submit to the\ndepartment.\nThe agency is in violation of the rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date June 27, 2022\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 8, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
