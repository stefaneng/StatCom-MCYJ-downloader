DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nBoth female houses are located on the east side of the center of campus. Putnam and\nGerber share housing designs wherein each house is a one-story, ranch-style home\nwith a basement. The basement is used for group activities, for storage, for doing\nlaundry, and as a “mud room” for shoes, coats, etc. Each house has a kitchen and a\ndining area where the youths eat breakfast, weekend meals, and other meals during\ntimes when the main campus dining area is closed. Each house has a day area/living\nroom and a bathroom. The sleeping area is in line-of-site of the day area, and consists\nof seven bedrooms. Two females sleep in each room, and the additional bedroom is\nused for storing clothing. Each bedroom contains shelves for clothing, a bunk bed and\na desk. In addition there is a House Supervisor’s office and a storage room for\ntoiletries, first aid and medications.\nB. Program Description\nThe female residential program consists of two separate houses – Putnam House,\nwhich serves an abuse/neglect population, and Gerber House, which serves a\ndelinquency population. The residential program serves female youths ages 12-17 and\ntheir families. These youths are struggling with emotional and behavioral issues to the\n2",
    "extent that the youth, the family and/or the community have been negatively impacted,\nresulting in the youth being removed from the home and the community.\nThe program accepts youths from the following.\n• DHS Delinquents.\n• DHS County offices (abuse/neglect).\n• County Court referrals.\n• Adoption Subsidy referrals.\n• Private referrals.\n• School Referrals.\nResidential programming is designed to meet the psychological, emotional, behavioral\nand spiritual needs of the youth and family. This is done through the following services:\n• Individual/group/family counseling.\n• Experiential programming including a 12-day wilderness program, weekend\nwilderness programs, community service programs and ropes and towers\ninitiatives.\n• Substance abuse counseling groups (when necessary).\n• Psychiatric evaluation (when necessary).\n• Psychological testing (when necessary).\n• Life skills.\n• Educational programming.\n• Home visits.\n• Voluntary chapel programming including chapel services, youth groups, and\nspiritual counseling.\n• Family weekends.\nYouths in Putnam, the abuse/neglect house, tend to stay in care longer than the youths\nin Gerber, the delinquency house. A large percentage of the females in both houses\nare coping with sexual trauma occurring throughout their lifetime, and with other cultural\nissues that may induce unhealthy behavior. For that reason, programming focuses\nheavily on health relationships, empowerment, boundaries, and a higher degree of self-\ninvestment and self-sufficiency.\nDischarge from the program can occur through Graduation, Escalation, Truancy or\nMaximum Benefit. With a discharge due to Graduation, Escalation or Maximum benefit,\nthe date of termination is established at least 30 days prior to release, so that\ntransitional counseling and maximizing community support services can occur.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe Eagle Village Gerber-Putnam program was reviewed as part of the overall Eagle\nVillage, Inc. residential licensing review conducted February 5 and 6 and March 6,\n3",
    "2007. All identified rule violations have been corrected, and the facility is in compliance\nwith all applicable rule areas.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that an Original Provisional License be issued, effective 9/4/2007.\n8/29/07\n________________________________________\nDavid Fein Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 29, 2007\n________________________________________\nLinda Lee Date\nArea Manager\n4"
