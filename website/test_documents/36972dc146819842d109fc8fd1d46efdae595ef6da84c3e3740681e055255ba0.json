Of the 31\nviolations established during this inspection, 19 are repeats from the 2021 interim\ninspection and 23 are repeats from the 2022 renewal inspection.

The agency has 2 new\nviolations this year, both related to adoption requirement timeliness.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator recognized non-compliances related to low staffing, staff\nturnover, new staff learning, and lack of placement and service resources for\nyouth.

Pictures were provided to verify the pool had been taken down.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nOctober 27, 2023\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 31, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n16"
