Youth A provided a written statement stating on\n03/20/25, Staff 1 slapped him because Staff 1 said he hit\nher on the back of her head.\n• Youth Discipline & Behavior Modification Policy states that\nany type of physical discipline is prohibited.

A youth initiating physical contact with a staff\nor another person with the intent of controlling or harming\nthat person and/or picks up something to use as a weapon\nis considered a physical assault. The appropriate staff\nresponse is to use a safe physical management procedure\nto control the youth and then use the Behavior\nManagement Procedure until the youth is under physical\nand emotional control.\n• Staff 1 has no disciplinary record. Staff 1 completed\nMANDT verbal de-escalation on 02/20/2025 and MANDT\nphysical skills training on 03/06/2025.\nAnalysis The facility is complaint with the rule based on interviews\nconducted and video footage reviewed there is insufficient\nevidence to support the allegations that staff slapped youth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
