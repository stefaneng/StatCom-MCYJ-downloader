INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription (1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\ncontact with children or parents to be a person who has the ability,\nexperience, education, and training to perform the duties\nassigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A staff member has shown discriminatory behavior towards a\nparent. On 7/16/25 Parent 1 reported he became aware of a\nsituation in which Foster Care Worker (FCW) told another staff\n(Agency Staff) about her bias and discrimination towards Parent 1.\nIt was reported by Agency Staff to Parent 1 that FCW was making\nParent 1’s life hard and treating him differently from other clients\nas Parent 1 reminded FCW of an ex-boyfriend and she could not\nstand that the children wanted to live with him.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nParent 1 was interviewed by phone on 7/23/25. Parent 1 stated\non 7/3/25 he asked Foster Care Worker (FCW) to be honest and\ntell him if she made a statement that he reminded her of an ex-\nboyfriend, and because of that she wanted to keep his kids away\nfrom him. FCW told Parent 1 she never said that. Parent 1 stated\nhe believed FCW was lying, as the person who gave him the\ninformation was credible, and FCW had a history of lying to Parent\n1, Parent 2, Parent 3, Relative Caregiver, and the court. Parent 1\n2",
    "stated he had also been subjected to racism from FCW. However,\nhe did not provide any specific examples.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed via video call on\n7/31/25. FCS reported she did not have any concerns about\nFCW’s behavior towards Parent 1. However, FCS reported she\nwas informed by MDHHS Supervisor that it was alleged FCW\nmade reference to Parent 1 reminding her of an ex-partner and\nnot trusting him. This was also reported to FCS by Parent 1. The\nallegation was also reported by Agency Staff to their supervisor.\nFCS addressed the allegation with FCW after the last court\nhearing. FCW became emotional and denied making those\nstatements. FCS stated she had a hard time deciding what was or\nwas not true. FCW had previously made statements during\nsupervision about not liking Parent 1’s actions, but never said she\ndid not like him, or did not want him to get his kids back. FCW\ntold FCS she wanted Parent 1 to do what was needed to get his\nkids back.\nAgency Staff was interviewed by phone on 8/1/25. Agency Staff\nreported she had been involved with the case for the past two\nmonths to assist with Parent 1’s visitation. At the beginning of the\ncase, Agency Staff was pulled from a team meeting by FCW and\nasked how the first visit went. Agency Staff reported it went well\nand there were no concerns. FCW seemed to be looking for\nAgency Staff to say something bad about Parent 1. When Agency\nStaff mentioned Parent 1 could have supervised the youngest\nchild a little more closely, FCW said, “see, see, I’m so worried. I\ndon’t think he’s good with those kids”. Then FCW made\nstatements that Parent 1 reminded her of her ex-partner, and that\nshe did not trust him, and he was a narcissist. Agency Staff stated\nFCW made her uncomfortable as the statements seemed bias\nabout Parent 1. However, Agency Staff stated she did not know\nmuch about the case at that point and tried to give FCW the\nbenefit of the doubt that she must have reason for feeling that\nway. After supervising visits for a few more weeks Relative\nCaregiver and Parent 1 mentioned some other incidents involving\nFCW, which made Agency Staff concerned there was some bias\noccurring. Agency Staff also recalled FCW previously describing\nParent 1 as angry, violent and inappropriate when they first\ndiscussed the case. Agency Staff had not observed any violent or\nangry behavior from Parent 1 while involved with the case.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via video call on\n8/27/25. FCW reported when she was assigned to the case she\nwas new to the agency and had not worked in foster care or been\n3",
    "a case worker before. FCW was told by MDHHS Worker that\nParent 1 was going to be very difficult and ‘a lot’ to deal with.\nFCW was informed Parent 1 previously made allegations that\nMDHHS Worker was not doing their job. The case then\ntransferred from MDHHS to the agency and unfortunately as the\ncase went on, Parent 1’s interactions with FCW were\nprogressively worse. FCW stated despite aggressive texts and\nemails from Parent 1, she continued doing her job as she was\ninstructed by FCS. FCW stated she never discriminated against\nParent 1, or anyone based on race/ethnicity. FCW reported she\nwas bewildered about why Agency Staff would make that\nallegation. FCW then said she also felt that the Agency Staff\nreporting their conversations was a breach of confidentiality and\nunprofessional. FCW indicated people say things in the office all\nthe time, but no one should repeat that information to clients. FCW\nstated she did not know Agency Staff well and only met with her\nonce or twice to brief her on the case before Agency Staff began\nassisting with parenting time. FCW recalled she told Agency Staff\nthat Parent 1 would talk over people, not accept guidance, and\nwould not accept feedback on how to correct issues as he\nseemed to think he knew everything. FCW stated Parent 1 had\nnarcissistic tendencies, although this was not an official diagnosis.\nWhile FCW denied stating she did not like Parent 1 because he\nreminded her of an ex-partner, FCW stated that she may have\ncompared Parent 1 to an ex-partner as they were both narcissists\nand “could not learn” because they “thought they knew\neverything”. FCW stated she shared this information with Agency\nStaff as a way to help her understand that Parent 1 was difficult\nand needed to be worked with and talked to in a “certain way” as\nhe “cannot learn”. FCW stated her intention was not to imply she\ndid not like him or wanted him to fail.\nRelative Caregiver was interviewed by phone on 8/29/25.\nRelative Caregiver reported she did not hear FCW make any\nstatements about Parent 1 being similar to her ex-partner.\nRelative Caregiver stated during home visits with the children, she\nnever heard FCW indicate she was afraid of Parent 1, or fearful of\nthe children returning to the care of Parent 1. FCW typically sat in\nthe kitchen and did not pay attention to the visits occurring in the\nliving room. FCW would then go to court and report things about\nparenting time and Parent 1 that were untrue. Relative Caregiver\nstated she did not know why FCW did not like Parent 1, but it was\nclear in her opinion that there was bias, as it seemed Parent 1\ncould never do anything right in FCW’s eyes.\n4",
    "MDHHS Worker was interviewed via video call on 9/3/25.\nMDHHS Worker reported she had very little contact with FCW\nwhen the case transferred. However, MDHHS Worker recalled\nFCW was new, and a more experienced worker probably should\nhave been assigned. MDHHS Worker stated she informed FCW\nthat Parent 1 was a “slick talker, a bull-sh**er, never held himself\naccountable, played the victim, and would take advantage of the\nsituation”. MDHHS Worker recalled Parent 1 made some vulgar\nstatements at times and made veiled threats while she had the\ncase. MDHHS worker stated FCW never reached out to her about\nways to work with Parent 1.\nAttempts were made to interview Parent 2 by phone on 8/26/25,\n9/3/25, and 9/9/25. Parent 2 initially seemed interested in\nproviding information but did not respond to subsequent contacts\nto complete an interview.\nAttempts were made to interview Parent 3 by phone on 8/26/25\nand 8/27/15. However, Parent 3 refused, and indicated her\nexperience with the agency made her believe they were not\nworking in her best interest. She refused to answer any other\nquestions.\nOn 9/18/25 MDHHS Supervisor was contacted via email.\nMDHHS Supervisor clarified they did not hear any direct\nstatements from FCW about Parent 1. However, they were\ninformed of the alleged statements by Parent 1. The information\nwas then discussed with FCS.\nAnalysis A violation was found. Based on interviews with case participants,\nit was determined FCW expressed bias opinions toward Parent 1\npotentially due to her own life experiences, which may have\nimpacted her ability to objectively manage the case and perform\nthe duties required in her position.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\n5",
    "Violation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The social service worker did not work with the parents and\nrelative caregiver to implement the service plan.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 7/16/25 Parent 1 reported to DCWL that he asked for a new\ncaseworker on several occasions due to concerns regarding FCW\ndiscriminating against and lying about him. Parent 1 reported he\nshared these concerns with FCS, his attorney, and the court on\nseveral occasions. Parent 1 stated FCW lied intentionally to keep\nParent 1 from making progress on the treatment plan and to make\nhim look bad in court. Parent 1 reported because of FCW’s lies he\nwas not able to advance to unsupervised visits for the duration of\nthe case. A phone interview occurred with Parent 1 on 7/23/25.\nParent 1 reported he had just learned FCW was no longer with the\nagency. Regardless, he wanted to have the investigation\ncompleted. The role of DCWL was clarified for Parent 1, and it\nwas explained that some of his concerns may need to be\naddressed through different departments within the State of\nMichigan. Resources were provided to Parent 1 to access those\ndepartments. Parent 1 reported that overall, he could not trust\nFCW, and she never supported reunification. Parent 1 reported\nthe whole experience with foster care was traumatic as FCW did\nnot include him in anything or allow him to have a say in any plans\nmade. FCW told Parent 1 that none of the visits or services\ncompleted while in jail “counted”. FCW would not discuss with him\nwhat needed to be done. Parent 1 stated FCW never said\nanything encouraging or discussed progress. Parent 1 stated he\nfelt he was making progress as he had employment, housing, and\na vehicle. But Parent 1 was never sure where he stood with FCW\nas she did not review the treatment plan or include him in\ndevelopment of it. Parent 1 stated he did not always receive\ncopies of the treatment plan from FCW. In addition, FCW lied in\ncourt reports and service plans about case progress. Parent 1\nreported he repeatedly contacted FCS for assistance, but she\nalways believed what FCW said and would not answer Parent 1’s\nquestions. Parent 1 requested a new worker multiple times, but a\ncaseworker change was never considered by the agency to his\nknowledge. Parent 1 shared the following specific concerns that\nhe believed showed FCW was mishandling the case:\nConcern 1: FCW falsely reported Parent 1 threatened her, and he\nhad a gun and ammunition at his home.\n6",
    "During the 7/23/25 phone interview with Parent 1, he reported an\nincident on 7/3/25 in which FCW was at his home with one of the\nchildren for visitation. Parent 1 asked FCW some questions about\nwhy she lied in the June 2025 court hearing. Parent 1 wanted\nclarification about information FCW shared in court, which Parent\n1 felt was incorrect. After that visit, FCW called law enforcement\nand falsely reported being threatened by Parent 1 and observing a\ngun and a box of ammunition at Parent 1’s home. Parent 1\nobtained a copy of the police report which indicated he\nthreatened her and said he “would ruin her”, while he had a gun\nand ammunition sitting in plain sight. Parent 1 denied making\nthreats toward FCW or having a gun. Parent 1 was aware that\nhaving a gun would have been a probation violation. Parent 1\nstated that in the police report FCW indicated she had been\nsupervising visits for the past year, which was incorrect as she\nhad only supervised for a few months. She was assigned the case\nin October 2024, and Parent 1 was incarcerated and not visiting\nfor the first few months of the case. In the police report FCW\nstated she was made to stand in the corner for the duration of the\nvisit and was belittled by Parent 1. Parent 1 denied that occurred.\nIn the police report FCW stated she felt threatened and therefore\ncontacted Parent 2 to pick up the child and end the visit early.\nParent 1 stated that it was untrue as he asked FCW to have\nParent 2 pick up the child early, as Parent 1 did not trust FCW\nbecause of the recent court hearing, and he did not want FCW in\nhis home any longer. Parent 1 reported had an audio recording of\nthe exchange, unbeknownst to FCW.\nOn 7/31/25 Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed via\nvideo call. Regarding the incident on July 3, 2025, FCS was not\npresent. However, she read FCWs statement to police which\nindicated Parent 1 was very escalated and FCW observed a gun\ncase and ammunition in Parent 1’s home.\nOn 8/1/25 Agency Staff was interviewed by phone. Agency Staff\nwas part of the Family Reunification Program (FRP) and assisted\nwith visitation for Parent 1 and the children. Regarding the 7/3/25\nincident at Parent 1’s house, Agency Staff reported she was not\npresent, but she listened to the audio Parent 1 recorded. Agency\nStaff stated Parent 1 did not sound threatening or violent in the\naudio and there was no mention of a gun. Agency Staff stated she\nhad never observed Parent 1 to have a gun or ammunition.\nOn 8/27/25 FCW was interviewed via video call. FCW reported on\n7/3/25 she was at Parent 1’s home for visitation. Parent 1 was\nvery hostile and escalated, poking his finger in her face while he\n7",
    "was holding the toddler child. FCW felt Parent 1 was manic,\nslurring his words, muttering, berating and criticizing the worker.\nThen his mood would rapidly shift, and he would play with his child\nfor a while. FCW tried to contact the agency for support for the\nduration of the two-hour visit. FCW stated she did not feel safe,\nbut no one from the agency responded to her requests for help.\nFCW suspected Parent 1 was on substances. FCW recalled one\nof the children once told her that Parent 1 previously had a gun.\nAfter the visit was over, FCW contacted the police for a wellness\ncheck as she was concerned about Parent 1. When asked if she\nreported seeing a gun, FCW stated she did not tell the police she\nsaw a gun. FCW told police she saw something that looked like it\ncould be for ammunition, but she could not confirm.\nAfter the holiday weekend, FCW returned to work and\nadministration acted like it was business as normal. FCW was\ninstructed to continue supervising parenting time in the home,\neven though she did not feel safe. After FCW provided details of\nthe incident, Program Manager agreed FCW would not need to go\nback into the home again. However, FCW was then placed on the\nschedule to supervise parenting time at Parent 1’s house. FCS\ntold FCW she could go with another person. FCW felt it was\nunsafe, even with another person. FCW felt unsupported,\nespecially when FCS asked FCW what she did to “set him off”. It\nfelt like FCS was implying the situation was FCW’s fault. FCW\nreported she previously felt unsupported in this case when FCS\ntold her that sometimes cases are just hard and she needed to\nfigure it out, but did not offer ways to provide support.\nOn 8/29/25 Relative Caregiver was interviewed by phone.\nRelative Caregiver was not present for the 7/3/25 incident.\nHowever, Relative Caregiver stated FCW never expressed any\nconcern about the children’s safety or indicated she believed\nParent 1 was dangerous or under the influence. Which made it\nconcerning that she would allege such things to law enforcement.\nRelative Caregiver stated neither of the children ever mentioned\nParent 1 owned a gun. Relative Caregiver believed FCW’s report\nabout one of the kids telling her there was a gun, then seeing a\nsuspected gun, was false.\nOn 9/10/25 Administrator provided written responses to some\nquestions from DCWL via email, as Program Manager was on an\nextended leave of absence. Regarding FCW stating that she sent\ntexts to several staff for assistance during the 7/3/25 visit and did\nnot receive a response, Administrator reported Program Manager\nresponded via text and instructed FCW to leave. FCW responded\nthat she was unable to leave. Per Administrator, the Program\n8",
    "Manager had a phone call with FCW directly after the visit to\ndiscuss the situation. Regarding FCW supervising visits in Parent\n1’s home after that incident, Program Manager told FCW she\nwould not have to return to the home. However, it was\ndetermined FCW and another staff could still supervise parenting\ntime. FCW was asked by FCS if she felt comfortable supervising\nwith another person present. FCW responded that she would be\nfine with that. The agency was working with the prosecutor to file a\nmotion with the court to change the location of visits to a public\nplace or MDHHS. FCW resigned from the agency before the\nmotion could be filed.\nAttempts were made to interview Parent 2 by phone on 8/26/25,\n9/3/25, and 9/9/25. Parent 2 initially seemed interested in\nproviding information but did not respond to subsequent contacts\nto complete an interview.\nVideo review:\nParent 1 reported he had a video of the visit at his home on\n7/3/25. However, a working file of the video was not received by\nDCWL.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Case assigned to agency and Foster Care Worker on\n10/4/24.\n• 7/3/25 Police Report filed by FCW. FCW reported she was\nthreatened and intimidated by Parent 1 during a supervised\nvisit. FCW reported Parent 1 was acting abnormally, very\nangry, and it made her uncomfortable. FCW stated Parent\n1 had made it clear over the past year that he did not like\nher. During the visit Parent 1 was swearing and belittling\nher. Parent 1 stated that FCW would “get what’s coming to\nher”. FCW ended the visit early by having the child’s\nmother pick him up. FCW believed Parent 1 was under the\ninfluence. FCW reported she believed Parent 1 had a\nfirearm in his possession and saw what she believed to be\na plastic gun case. FCW clarified she did not see a gun,\njust a case.\n• Summary of case contact dated 7/3/25 authored by FCW.\nParenting time at Parent 1’s home. FCW reported details of\na tense exchange with Parent 1 as he vented frustration\nwith the case. Parent 1 told FCW she could not sit on his\nfurniture; she could stand for the visit and not touch any of\nhis stuff. Parent 1 confronted FCW about an allegation that\nwas reported to MDHHS of Parent 1 traveling out of state\nwith Relative Caregiver and a child. Parent 1 believed FCW\n9",
    "was responsible for this false complaint. FCW text Program\nManager that she needed help ASAP at 5:05PM. FCW text\nanother staff at 5:14PM requesting help ASAP. Parent 1\nsaid he’d “spend every last dollar to get (FCW) fired”. FCW\nwas scared and crying but did not receive a response from\nagency staff. Parent 1 complained about the distance he\nneeded to travel for drug screens to be compliant and\nstated he did not trust FCW. FCW received a text from\nProgram Manager at 5:49PM to end the visit if she felt\nthreatened. FCW responded at 5:52PM there was no easy\nway to leave without escalating the situation. No response\nwas received. At 6:16PM Parent 1 told FCW she could go\nahead and sit. At 6:27PM FCW text FCS requesting help\nbut did not receive a response. Parent 1 was very\naccusatory in his conversation with FCW. FCW believed\nParent 1 was under the influence as he was verbally\naggressive towards FCW. FCW observed what appeared to\nbe ammunition alongside a black case. One of the children\npreviously told FCW Parent 1 had a gun when they lived\nsomewhere else. Parent 1 yelled that he wanted FCW out\nof his house. FCW text Parent 2 and requested she pick up\nthe child immediately. Parent 1 continued speaking to FCW\nin an aggressive tone. The child appeared scared. Parent 2\narrived and FCW rushed out the door and got in her car.\nFCW observed Parent 2 buckle the child in the car seat and\nprepare to leave. FCW then left before Parent 2 left with the\nchild.\nConcern 2: FCW falsely reported in court that she discussed\nguardianship with Parent 1 and Relative Caregiver.\nIn the phone interview on 7/23/25, Parent 1 reported FCW never\ndiscussed Guardianship with him.\nOn 8/27/25 an interview was completed with FCW via video call.\nFCW reported being with the agency for approximately one year\nand leaving suddenly due to a lack of support from the agency\nand concerns for how the job impacted her health. FCW stated\nshe received guidance from MDHHS and the agency, but it was\nhard to know who to listen to. At times MDHHS was very assertive\nin how they wanted things done, which was different from what the\nagency wanted. At one-point MDHHS wanted termination, while\nthe agency wanted to look toward guardianship for a goal. FCW\nreported requesting a goal change to guardianship in court. FCW\nstated she discussed guardianship with Relative Caregiver but not\n10",
    "with Parent 1. FCW could not recall details of their discussion with\nRelative Caregiver about guardianship.\nIn the 8/29/25 phone interview Relative Caregiver reported she\nattended all hearings for this case and observed FCW to report\nfalse information on more than one occasion. In June 2025 FCW\nreported to court that she spoke with Parent 1 and Relative\nCaregiver at length about guardianship of the youth. When\nquestioned by court if both types of guardianship were discussed,\nFCW said yes and told court that Relative Caregiver agreed to\nJuvenile Guardianship. Court asked FCW if Relative Caregiver\nwas aware that she would no longer receive a foster care payment\nand would not qualify for state assistance payments. FCW\nanswered yes. Relative Caregiver stated she never had a\nconversation with FCW about guardianship and never agreed to\nguardianship knowing there would be no financial assistance. At a\nsubsequent visit to the home, Relative Caregiver confronted FCW.\nFCW did not explain why she lied, but FCW stated that she did not\neven know there were two types of guardianship until that moment\nin court. When pressed about why she lied, FCW did not have an\nanswer.\nDocuments reviewed:\nReview of case record in MiSACWIS\n• No case contacts were found documenting discussion of\nguardianship between FCW and Relative Caregiver or\nParent 1.\n• No FTM or TDM regarding a goal change to guardianship\nwas located in the file.\nVideo recording of 6/11/25 court hearing\nFCW requested a goal change to guardianship. FCW stated she\nspoke with Relative Caregiver, who agreed that Juvenile\nGuardianship should be the goal. FCW was asked if Relative\nCaregiver understood it would be Juvenile and not be Subsidized\nGuardianship and if she was willing to do guardianship without\nany state financial assistance and also lose the foster care\npayments. FCW said Relative Caregiver was aware and agreed to\nthat. When asked if Relative Caregiver was close to being\nlicensed, as was required, FCW stated Relative Caregiver had\nstopped the licensing process and did not plan to continue. FCW\nwas questioned by the court why she would recommend Juvenile\nGuardianship if Relative Caregiver was unwilling to become\nlicensed. FCW acknowledged it was not a viable plan and\ndiscussed looking for placement for the child with relatives out of\nstate but indicated it would be best for the child to remain in\n11",
    "current placement as the goal was still reunification. The court did\nnot understand FCW’s recommendation and stated the goal would\nnot be changed to Guardianship. However, the request was noted.\nConcern 3: FCW incorrectly stated in court that Parent 1 was not\nemployed, had positive drug screens, and refused to screen.\nIn a phone interview on 7/23/25, Parent 1 reported that he may\nhave missed some screens as FCW would not answer his phone\ncalls to tell him when and where to screen. FCW also did not\nadminister some drug screens correctly, as she did not secure the\ntop with the sticky label as required.\nDuring the 7/31/25 video call interview, FCS reported Parent 1\nand Relative Caregiver contacted her on numerous occasions to\nexpress concerns about FCW. FCS had several conversations\nwith FCW and viewed a lot of case documentation to verify\ninformation reported in service plans and court reports was\naccurate. FCS noted Parent 1 had been difficult to work with and\noften sent verbally aggressive emails to FCW. FCS stated she\nwas not aware of any instances where FCW lied in court.\nRegarding employment, FCS clarified that FCW did not report\nParent 1 lacked employment, she reported Parent 1 did not\nprovide her with proof of employment. Regarding drug screens,\nFCS stated FCW reported accurately that Parent 1 had not done\ndrug screens with the agency. FCS was aware Parent 1 had\ncompleted weekly drug screens through a substance abuse\ntreatment provider. Regarding the allegation that FCW did not\nanswer calls for drug screens, FCS stated that beginning March\n2025, Parent 1 was required to call a different number, then email\nhis attorney and MDHHHS to notify them if he had to screen that\nday. Parent 1 admitted to FCW he was not doing those things\nconsistently. Prior to March 2025, Parent 1 was not required to\ncall FCW. FCW would plan to randomly screen him at parenting\ntime, or text him to come in. FCS reported Parent 1 never\ncompleted drug screens with the FCW or the agency. However,\nshe found a note in the file indicating on 12/23/24 the observer\nsection of a drug screen was not completed thoroughly by FCW.\nFCS stated there was no way to find out what happened as there\nwas no one else present and FCW would have been the only\nperson to know.\nDuring the 8/27/25 video call, FCW stated Parent 1 accused her of\nlying in court. FCW stated she could only report information she\ncould verify and at the time she did not have employment\nverification for Parent 1, so she could not report that he was\n12",
    "working. FCW stated Parent 1 had reportedly started a business\nand was self-employed. FCW stated Parent 1 provided a 2019\ndocument to show the business was created but did not provide\ndocumentation the business was still running. FCW reported she\nalways provided accurate information to court, such as Parent 1\nnot complying with anger management class, parenting class,\nAA/NA meetings, or DV counseling. These services were outlined\nin the PATP. However, FCW admitted she had not been able to\nreview the PATP with Parent 1 or discuss services or referrals.\nFCW reported Parent 1 was required to participate in drug\nscreens. Parent 1 refused to participate in screens administered\nby FCW or FCS. Parent 1 initially completed two screens in\nDecember 2024 with FCW, but none after. FCW reported she\nadministered these screens after she received training from the\nagency to do so. FCW admitted she was unaware of the\nrequirement to have the donor cross hatch the stickers over the\nvial for security. FCW heard this from another worker sometime\nafter she had already been administering screens. FCW stated\nthis was likely covered in training, but she could not remember.\nFCW noted that the screens she completed with Parent 1 may not\nhave been done correctly, but they were all negative. Subsequent\nscreens were completed at a MDHHS office. Parent 1 was\nrequired to call the automated system by 5:00AM and if his color\nwas called, he had to screen between 12:00-1:00PM. Parent 1\ntold FCW he called a few times but never attended because he\nworked during that time. FCW stated Parent 1 was never required\nto call her for screens and she never blocked his number.\nAdditionally, FCW reported that the medical provider reported\nParent 1 tampered with a drug screen. FCW indicated there was\ndocumentation on file for this.\nOn 8/29/25 Relative Caregiver was interviewed by phone.\nRelative Caregiver reported she was aware Parent 1 was working\nfull time and overtime. Relative Caregiver stated she did not have\nany firsthand knowledge about Parent 1’s drug screens or if they\nwere accurately reported to court. However, Relative Caregiver\nreported she had not observed Parent 1 to be under the influence,\nor showing any concerning behavior. She had no reason to\nsuspect he was using substances again. Relative Caregiver stated\nshe knew what he was like under the influence before, and she\ndid not have any concerns at this time.\nDocuments reviewed:\nPersonnel file for Foster Care Worker\n• FCW completed Forensic Fluids “Oral Fluid Drug testing\nCollection Procedure” training on 7/25/24.\n13",

Parent 1 stated\nhe was unsure how he could do drug screens five days per\nweek, during his work hours. Parent 1 already participated\nin screens as a probation requirement at another facility;\nsecondary screens seemed unnecessary. Parent 1 also\nasked why FCW lied in court and said he was not working,\nand his screen came back as “cannot interpret”. Parent 1\nreported he confirmed with facility that the screen was\nnegative.\n14",

This location was\nselected as it was close to his home and employment.\n• FCW reported Parent 1 was non-compliant with services\nand needed to successfully complete drug screens before\nunsupervised visitation could be recommended.\nConcern 4: FCW reported incorrect medical information to the\ncourt about Parent 1 in June 2025. Per FCW a provider reported\nParent 1 admitted to relapsing in March 2025.\nIn a phone interview on 7/23/25, Parent 1 reported he had\nrevoked the release of information in February 2025 and\nconfirmed with the physician’s office that they had not provided\nFCW with anything since December 2024. Therefore, any\ninformation FCW reported she obtained from the physician’s office\nsince February 2025 was a lie.\nDuring the 7/31/25 video call FCS stated that early in the case\nduring a Team Decision Making Meeting (TDM) Parent 1 said he\nwould sign anything. At a later TDM he said he did not receive\nreleases. FCW said she provided them, but FCS did not know for\ncertain what happened. FCW reported to FCS that Parent 1\nsigned the releases at a later date.\nDuring the 8/27/25 interview, FCW reported Parent 1 was\ncompliant in this area. FCW recalled Parent 1 signed release\nforms for his probation officer, the clinic where he received\ntreatment and drug screens, and another provider. FCW stated\nParent 1 never revoked the release of information form. FCW\nindicated she believed Parent 1 relapsed in March 2025. FCW did\nnot provide any detail as to why she believed this.\nVideo recording of 6/11/25 court hearing\nFCW reported that Parent 1 admitted to his doctor that he\nrelapsed in March 2025.\nDocuments reviewed:\nReview of case record in MiSACWIS\n• No contacts or documents were found to indicate FCW\nreceived information from a provider about Parent 1\nadmitting to a relapse.\n15",

The\noffice verified that Parent 1 signed a consent to release\nrecords to the agency on 12/19/24. A new release was then\nsigned on 12/26/24, limiting the office to only release drug\nscreen results and no other information. The office\nconfirmed no information had been sent to FCW since\n12/26/24.\nConcern 5: FCW allowed a child to travel out of state without\nparental consent.\nIn a phone interview on 7/23/25, Parent 1 reported that in June\n2025 FCW falsely reported consent for travel and presented that\ninformation to MDHHS and court. After the child had already left\nout of state, FCW asked Parent 1 to sign consent forms.\nDuring the 7/31/25 video call, FCS stated Relative Caregiver only\ngave FCW a little over a week notice about the trip. Per FCW,\nRelative Caregiver told FCW that Parent 1 was aware of the trip.\nFCW reportedly contacted Parent 1 to schedule a visit to sign the\nform. FCW reportedly notified MDHHS and court but did not\nreceive a response. The day after they left, a complaint came into\nMDHHS indicating no one knew about the travel. When contacted,\nParent 1 stated he knew about the trip but did not want to sign the\nconsent form. Parent 3 did not respond to worker’s request for\nconsent.\nDuring the 8/27/25 interview FCW stated Relative Caregiver\ncontacted her around June 13th, with plans to travel out of state on\nJune 22nd. FCW was instructed by FCS to get an itinerary from\nRelative Caregiver to provide to court, which she did. The\nfollowing week MDHHS requested a different document, which\nFCW was not previously aware of. MDHHS provided the form and\nrequested signatures from the parents. FCW then learned Parent\n3 was in Arizona and refused to communicate with FCW. FCW\nreported communication attempts were documented in\nMiSACWIS. FCW emailed Parent 1 about the travel dates. Parent\n1 did not necessarily provide approval, but he acknowledged that\nparenting time would need to be rescheduled due to the trip. FCW\ntold MDHHS that Parent 1 acknowledged he was aware of the\ntravel and MDHHS said they would see if court would count that\nas consent. MDHHS then responded they needed the signed\nconsent form. FCW was instructed by FCS to have Parent 1 sign\n16",
    "the travel consent form. Parent 1 refused to sign the form when he\nreceived it on 6/24/25, as the youth had already been out of state\nsince 6/20/25. FCW stated she did not ask Parent 1 to backdate\nthe form. FCW reported she was not aware of the form prior to\nthat date, or she would have tried to get it signed earlier. FCW\nalso reported she received the form late on a Friday and the\nagency told her she could not send emails on nights or weekends,\nso she had to wait until Monday 6/24/25.\nDuring the 8/29/25 phone interview Relative Caregiver stated she\ninformed FCW of the trip on 6/13/25. Relative Caregiver stated\nshe never told FCW they had verbal permission from Parent 1. On\n6/17/25 FCW told Relative Caregiver that she had verbal\npermission from Parent 3. However, on 6/20/25 FCW was at\nRelative Caregiver’s house and asked if she knew how to reach\nParent 3, as she had not had any contact with her.\nOn 9/10/25 Administrator provided written responses to some\nquestions from DCWL via email, as Program Manager was on an\nextended leave of absence. Regarding the out of state travel,\nFCW was given guidance by FCS to obtain a detailed itinerary.\nFCW contacted the prosecutor and GAL on 6/16/25 to request\npermission to travel. On 6/17/25 Parent 1 sent an email indicating\nhe was aware of the travel. On 6/19/25 the prosecutor reported\nthey had not received anything from FCW and advised she\nneeded to contact MDHHS. On 6/19/25 FCS responded and\ndirected FCW to get something in writing from both parents giving\ntheir consent. FCS provided policy to FCW regarding travel and\ncc’d MDHHS Supervisor. MDHHS Supervisor provided their\ncounty specific form to FCW on 6/20/25. On 6/24/25 FCW sent the\nform to Parent 1. On 6/24/25 FCW and FCS received an email\nfrom Parent 1 refusing to sign the form since the child was already\nout of state.\nAttempts were made to interview Parent 3 by phone on 8/26/25\nand 8/27/15.

She refused to answer any other\nquestions.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• 6/24/25 email from FCW to Parent 1 stating “please review\nand sign”. The attachment was the travel letter dated\n6/20/25, requesting approval from Parent 1 for the child to\ntravel on 6/21-6/28/25. FCW indicated on the letter that she\n17",
    "did not have success contacting Parent 3 and that Parent 1\nhad given verbal permission on 6/17/25.\n• Case contacts were reviewed for 6/17/25.

Parent 1 asked why FCW was just now\nsending paperwork for approval for his son to travel out of\nstate when he was already gone. Parent 1 acknowledged\nthat he was aware of the trip, but FCW never asked about\npermission or provided the correct consent form until now.\nParent 1 refused to sign the form, indicating that he would\nnot help FCW do her job and cover her tracks when she\nfailed to do what she was supposed to do. Parent 1 cc’d his\nattorney and requested a new caseworker.\n• Case contacts for June 2025 between FCW and Relative\nCaregiver were reviewed. There was no indication that\nRelative Caregiver reported telling FCW she had verbal\npermission from Parent 1 to travel out of state with the\nyouth.\n• Case contacts for June 2025 between Parent 3 and FCW\nwere reviewed. There were no contacts indicating Parent 3\nprovided consent.\nConcern 6:\nFCW entered Relative Caregiver’s home without permission, by\nusing a hidden spare key.\nDuring the 7/31/25 video call, FCS was asked if FCW ever\nentered Relative Caregiver’s home without permission, while the\ncaregiver was not present. FCS stated this did happen. FCW was\nplaced on disciplinary action in November 2024 due to the\nincident. FCW told FCS that she arrived at the home before the\nrelative. The 9-year-old child that was with FCW got out of the car,\nused the hidden key and entered the home before FCW could\nstop him. The child said it was okay and FCW believed him.\nRelative Caregiver arrived at the home and was very unhappy.\nFCW understood why she should not have done that.\nDuring the 8/27/25 interview with FCW, she reported that she did\nenter Relative Caregiver’s home without permission. FCW arrived\nat the house and Relative Caregiver was not there yet. One youth\nsaid he knew where the key was and that it was ok to go in. He\nwas about 9 years old at the time. FCW stated she carried the 1-\nyear-old into the doorway and placed him in the walker by the\n18",
    "door. The other child went in and FCW waited outside. When\nasked if she was concerned about the child being in the home\nunsupervised, FCW stated she could see him from the door.\nRelative Caregiver arrived home a few minutes later and was\nupset. FCW spoke with her for about an hour, apologizing, and\neverything seemed ok. Two months later, FCS and Program\nManager asked FCW about the incident, as they received a\ngrievance. FCW admitted he should have said no to the child and\ncalled Relative Caregiver. FCW stated she also should have\nnotified the agency about the incident when it happened.\nDuring the 8/29/25 phone interview Relative Caregiver recalled\nthe incident. Relative Caregiver was running late from work that\nday and when she pulled into the driveway, she was surprised to\nsee FCWs car with no one in it. Relative Caregiver walked up to\nthe house and FCW came out from inside the house. FCW met\nRelative Caregiver at the door and explained that the 9-year-old\nchild had used the spare key to get in. Relative Caregiver told\nFCW that was unacceptable. Relative Caregiver later emailed\nFCS about the incident. FCS replied that to her knowledge FCW\ndid not enter the home but waited outside the door. Relative\nCaregiver let FCS know that it was a lie, as she observed FCW in\nthe house, and FCW told her about how the 1-year-old child was\nreally fast and she had to chase him down the hall to get him into\nthe walker.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nReview of case record in MiSACWIS\n• Case contact completed by FCW for home visit on 10/10/24\nwas reviewed. FCW did not include any information about\nentering Relative Caregiver’s home with a key, while they\nwere not present. No indication FCW reported the incident\nto FCS.\nPersonnel file for Foster Care Worker\n• FCW was hired on 7/1/2024 as a case worker and\ncompleted new hire training as required.\n• HR memo dated 12/6/24\no “Most recently, on 11/20/24, your supervisor\nreceived an email from a relative caregiver reporting\nconcerns that you had entered their home without\ntheir consent to do so. They noted on 10/10/24, you\nhad completed a parenting time visit with the\nchildren in their care and were transporting them\nback to the home. Upon arrival to the home, relative\ncaregiver was not present, but the 9-year-old stated\nthat he was aware of there being a spare key. You\n19",
    "allowed the 9-year-old to retrieve the spare key and\nentered the relatives’ home without an adult being\npresent. Based on these concerns, it has been\ndetermined that it would be best if you were in the\noffice at a minimum of 2 days per week”. “FCW\nshould continue to have monthly supervision with\nher supervisor, with the addition of a second\nsupervision per month.” “FCW should utilize her\nOutlook and paper calendars to track due dates and\nensure monthly meetings are occurring”. “FCW\nshould utilize monthly visit report sheets to keep\ntrack of information given at monthly meetings with\ncaregiver, children and parents, and provide these\nsheets to her supervisor”. Signed by FCW and FCS\n12/6/24.\nOther documents\n• 11/20/24 email from Relative Caregiver to FCS. The email\noutlined Relative Caregivers concerns about FCW entering\nthe home when she was not present, and FCW allowing the\n10-year-old to drink coffee (see Concern 9). The\ninformation in the email was consistent with the information\nprovided in the interview with Relative Caregiver.\nConcern 7: Parenting time was cancelled unjustly on a few\noccasions.\nIn a phone interview on 7/23/25, Parent 1 reported he believed\nparenting time should not have been canceled, as he confirmed\nthe visit with FCW only a few minutes late. In other instances,\nthere were issues with the Relative Caregiver that caused\ncanceled visits that were not rescheduled.\nDuring the 7/31/25 video call FCS stated the court order required\nParent 1 to confirm by 9:00AM, or the visit will be cancelled.\nParent 1 would often contact FCW after 9:00AM. The visits were\ncancelled in those instances in order to be compliant with the\ncourt order.\nDuring the 8/27/25 video call FCW reported Parent 1 was\ninconsistent with confirming visits. A court order required visits to\nbe supervised. The Parent Agency Treatment Plan outlined that\nParent 1 had to call by 9:00AM or a visit would be cancelled.\nParent 1 was aware, as this was also discussed in court. FCW\nreported that some parenting visits were cancelled due to Parent 1\nconfirming late and some due to difficulty with transportation or\nRelative Caregiver.\n20",
    "Documents reviewed\n• Court order dated 3/5/25 stated Parent 1 will confirm\nparenting time with the agency via email by 9:00AM on the\nday of scheduled parenting time.\n• Email chain from 3/13/25 with Parent 1, FCW, FCS and\nparent’s attorney. Parent 1 confirmed parenting time visit at\n11:27AM. FCS responded at 11:30AM that visitation was\ncanceled, as he did not confirm by 9:00AM.\n• Email chain from 3/25/25 with Parent 1, FCW, FCS and\nparent’s attorney. Parent 1 confirmed parenting time visit at\n9:37AM. Parenting time was cancelled that day for not\nconfirming by 9:00AM.\n• Email chain with Agency Staff, FCW and FCS dated\n5/29/25 9:36AM, Parent 1 confirmed visit but wanted to\nchange it to the following day due to emergency. Agency\nStaff agreed to supervise visit on 5/30/25.\n• Email chain with Agency Staff, FCW and FCS dated\n5/30/25. At 3:39PM Agency Staff was informed by Relative\nCaregiver that she could not do the visit. Agency Staff\nnotified Parent 1. Parent 1 was upset and asked why he\nhad no say in this when the visit had already been\nconfirmed. Agency Staff asked FCW and FCS if something\ncould be worked out to allow Parent 1 to see the children.\nFCS responded that Parent 1 and Relative Caregiver\nshould be contacting FCW about this. Agency Staff stated\nthat Relative Caregiver had contacted FCW about the visit\nbut did not hear back from her. Agency Staff agreed to\nredirect them to FCW in the future. There was no plan to\nprovide a visit for Parent 1.\nVideo recording of 6/11/25 court hearing\nCourt noted that parenting time was to occur as two supervised\nvisits per week. For that review period Parent 1 completed 9 of 16\nvisits. Two visits were not confirmed on time and therefore\ncanceled. Three or more visits were canceled as FCW did not\nhear back from Relative Caregiver. FCW confirmed there were no\nattempts by the agency to reschedule these missed visits.\nConcern 8: FCW intentionally provided misinformation and did or\nsaid things to delay reunification or aggravate case members.\nDuring the 8/1/25 phone interview Agency Staff reported she\nheard audio recording of the 6/17/25 court hearing in which the\nattorneys could be heard questioning FCW. FCW said that Parent\n3 was unfit to be around the kids because she liked to be inside\nwatching movies, not outside playing ball. The court could be\n21",
    "heard disagreeing with this. FCW also reported that the family\ncould not begin Family Reunification Program (FRP) as there\nwere no openings. However, Agency Staff stated that was a not\ntrue, as they worked in FRP and knew there were openings\navailable. Agency Staff recalled FCW asked FRP to wait because\nshe wanted Parent 2 to have more supervised visits before\nstarting FRP. Agency Staff reported a few additional actions by\nFCW that she found troublesome while involved in the case. FCW\ntold Agency Staff that a court order stated Parent 1 and Parent 2\nhad a no contact order. FCW reportedly told Parent 1 he could not\nbe near Parent 2, despite the fact they were expecting a baby. As\nParent 1 mentioned couples counseling to Agency Staff, she\nrequested the court order from FCW to determine if they could\nparticipate in couples counseling. The court order was reviewed\nby Agency Staff and found there was no mention of a no contact\norder. Additionally, Agency Staff mentioned she recalled being\npart of a conversation in which FCW mentioned camping near the\nRelative Caregiver’s home to keep an eye on them.\nOn 9/18/25 a follow-up email was received from FCW. Regarding\nFRP, FCW reported that a referral was submitted prior to her\nresignation on 7/25/25 but she did not know the date. The FRP\nworker was responsible for scheduling services. She did not\nprovide any other information. Regarding the allegation of FCW\nstating they were camping near Relative Caregiver to ‘keep an\neye on them’, FCW denied this. FCW stated she was taking her\nfamily camping and due to the proximity of Relative Caregiver’s\nhome FCW stated she reassured the family that if they saw her in\nthe community she would not approach or acknowledge them, in\norder to preserve their confidentiality. FCS stated that she did\nwork during this camping trip, but she was not monitoring the\nfamily.\nDuring the 8/29/25 phone interview Relative Caregiver reported\nshe recalled an unusual incident once in court. FCW testified that\nduring a supervised visit with Parent 3 the youth saw a tent in the\nwood and wanted to go look at it, but Parent 3 and FCW said no.\nRelative Caregiver stated this was different than what FCW\noriginally told her when the incident happened. The original story\nfrom FCW was that the child and Parent 3 went to look at the tent,\nwhile FCW stayed behind. This was confirmed to Relative\nCaregiver by the child. Relative Caregiver thought this was an odd\nthing to lie about in court and did not understand FCWs reasoning.\nRelative Caregiver recalled another situation in which Parent 1\nwas on a video call with the older child. Parent 1 observed the\nchild to be drinking coffee. FCW told Parent 1 that the child said\n22",
    "he was allowed to drink coffee and that Relative Caregiver let him\ndrink it all the time. Relative Caregiver said that was absolutely not\ntrue, and that she did not drink coffee or even keep it in the house.\nIt made her very uncomfortable how easily FCW lied in that\nsituation. It also bothered Relative Caregiver that FCW did a lot of\npaperwork last minute and did not seem informed of policies. For\nexample, the children received Christmas gifts from Operation\nGood Cheer. FCW failed to let Relative Caregiver know until after\nthe due date passed, that thank you notes had to be submitted.\nOverall, Relative Caregiver felt that FCW would nitpick at Parent\n1’s abilities and report things about parenting time such as when\nhe forgot to put the lock on the stroller wheels at the park. But\nFCW would never report all of the good things Parent 1 did.\nRelative Caregiver noted FCW likely did not notice the positive as\nshe rarely paid attention to the visits and often sat in the kitchen\nwhile Parent 1 and the kids visited in the living room. Relative\nCaregiver said it appeared that FCW was always looking for the\nworst in Parent 1 and tearing him down. FCW did not advocate for\nthe family or provide resources when they asked for help. It was\nuncomfortable to have her in the home a she seemed to want the\nkids to be removed from their parents permanently. Overall,\nRelative Caregiver reported FCW did not do an adequate job and\ncould have benefited from some training and better supervision.\nOn 9/10/25 Administrator provided written responses to some\nquestions from DCWL via email, as Program Manager was on an\nextended leave of absence. Regarding the report of FCW\nproviding coffee to the 10-year-old child, Administrator reported\nthe inappropriateness of this incident was discussed with FCW but\nnot documented in the disciplinary action memo.\nDocuments Reviewed\n• Email dated 1/29/25. Relative Caregiver provided this email\nas an example of FCW not being timely with paperwork.\nThe email was from Operation Good Cheer to FCW, dated\n1/7/25, requesting thank you notes to be submitted for gifts\nno later than 1/27/25. FCW did not send this email to\nRelative Caregiver until 1/29/25.\n• 11/20/24 email from Relative Caregiver to FCS. The email\noutlined Relative Caregivers concerns about FCW entering\nthe home when she was not present, and FCW allowing the\n10-year-old to drink coffee. The information in the email\nwas consistent with the information provided in the\ninterview with Relative Caregiver.\n23",
    "Case review in MiSACWIS\n• Court orders were reviewed. There was no court order on\nfile indicating a no-contact order between Parent 1 and\nParent 2.\nPersonnel file for Foster Care Worker\n• HR memo dated 12/6/24\no Since 7/1/24 “numerous conversations have\noccurred regarding foster care policy and agency\nrequirements. One requirement is meeting with\nchildren, biological parents, and foster parents at\nleast monthly. In September 2024, you did not\ncomplete the required monthly visits on 1 of your\ncases”. “Additionally, policies surrounding office\nprotocols have been discussed during monthly\nsupervisions, through email and text, but have not\nbeen followed”. “The supervisor has spoken with\nclients since your transition to this role regarding a\nlack of clear communication, particularly surrounding\nparenting time visits. Foster parents and biological\nparents feel that the communication regarding\nparenting time has not been clear and that the\nschedule is often changing, with little notice”.\no Undated 2025 Performance Review for FCW. The\nreviewer, FCS, noted that FCW struggled with\n‘various aspects of this position’ including completion\nof job duties efficiently, meeting deadlines for visits,\nproviding court documentation, and communication\nwith clients and coworkers. Of the six areas\nreviewed, FCW met expectation in three areas\n(customer service, teamwork, decision making) and\ndid not meet expectation in three areas (job duties,\naccountability, communication).\nVideo recording of 6/11/25 court hearing\n• FCW stated referral for FRP would be completed that week\nand availability for FRP to begin would be two weeks later.\n• FCW discussed the tent incident and reported the youth\napproached an unknown tent in the woods while Parent 3\nwatched him. FCW was supervising and felt the situation\nwas dangerous but did not step in to stop the youth. After\nthe youth approached the tent, FCW told Parent 3 they\nneeded to back up. Parent 3 and the youth returned to\nFCW.\n• FCW requested suspension of parenting time for Parent 3.\nFCW stated Parent 3 did not have much engagement or\n24",
    "discussion with the youth, and would spend time watching\nmovies with the youth, rather than playing outside. FCW\ntestified the youth said he would like to be more active and\nhave more time with Parent 3. Court questioned why FCW\nwould recommend suspending parenting time when her\nconcern was that the parent did not engage enough. Court\nindicated more engagement and parenting coaching\nseemed more fitting. Court did not suspend parenting time,\nbut the order was amended to indicate the agency did not\nhave to actively seek parenting time; Parent 3 had to\nrequest visits which the agency would then schedule.\nConcern 9: FCW lied about Parent 3, withheld visits with the\nchildren, and did not provide resources when facing\nhomelessness.\nIn a phone interview on 7/23/25, Parent 1 reported that FCW’s\nactions resulted in Parent 3 feeling hopeless about reunification\nand leaving the state. Parent 1 stated that Parent 3 was not good\nat advocating for herself and was essentially bullied by FCW into\ngiving up. Because of that, Parent 3 did not trust the agency or\nMDHHS and did not fight for her rights.\nAttempts were made to interview Parent 3 by phone on 8/26/25\nand 8/27/15. However, Parent 3 refused, and indicated her\nexperience with the agency made her believe they were not\nworking in her best interest.
