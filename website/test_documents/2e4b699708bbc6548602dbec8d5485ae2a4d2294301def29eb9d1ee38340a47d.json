INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of Staff\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinue needs, protection and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 2/26/23, youth was found in a closet and admitted to ingesting\nlaundry detergent. On the same date, another youth was found\nwith hand sanitizer in their room and also admitted to ingesting it.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via\ntelephone on 2/27/23 and face to face at the facility on 3/1/23.\nCA reported Youth A was on full restrictions and precautions after\nthe incident with the laundry detergent because Youth A’s intent\nwas self-harm. CA reported Youth B was not on restrictions or\nprecautions after the hand sanitizer incident because Youth B’s\nintent was to get drunk and not to self-harm. Youth A accessed\n2",
    "the laundry detergent because it was in the activity closet, which\ncan be accessed by youth under staff supervision. CA reported at\nthe time of the incident, the activity closet was propped open and\nhad been for hours. Laundry detergent has always been in the\nactivity closet and typically staff use the laundry detergent bottles\nto prop the door. Laundry detergent was in the activity closet\nbecause it was a low-risk chemical, and they use it frequently to\nteach the youth independent living skills. All laundry detergent has\nbeen moved to the janitor’s closet, which no youth can access. CA\nreported she is not sure where Youth B received the hand\nsanitizer from as it is not the same kind they utilize at the facility.\nCA reported all hand sanitizer is removed from the unit and they\nare ensuring all hand sanitizer is non-alcoholic moving forward.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/1/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported she was\neating dinner in the dining room of the milieu. After dinner, she\nsaw the activity closet door was propped open, so she went into\nthe activity closet and drank three handfuls of laundry detergent.\nShe reported she shut the door, but the light was still on. She\nreported staff did not know she was in there until another youth\nsuggested she may be in the activity closet, which is when Staff 5\nopened the door and found her. She estimates being in the activity\ncloset with the door shut for about 10-15 minutes. Youth A\nreported she does not need staff to go with her into the activity\ncloset, but she stated she is supposed to ask permission before\nentering the closet, which she did not do. She reported she has\nnever drunk laundry detergent before.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/1/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported on\n2/26/23, staff could not find Youth A, so Youth B suggested they\nlook in the activity closet. She reported she made this suggestion\nbecause when she used to self-harm, she would do it by ingesting\nchemicals, and she noticed the activity room door was shut. Youth\nB reported all youth had to go to their rooms while staff addressed\nthe situation with Youth A. Youth B reported the incident with\nYouth A triggered her, so she began punching her pillow and the\nwall in her room. Youth B stated the youth on the other side of her\nbedroom wall began screaming and yelling at her to stop. Youth B\nstated she threatened the other youth and told her to come out of\nher room so they could fight in the hallway. Youth B reported she\nopened her door and went into the hallway, but the other youth\nwould not fully come out of her room. Staff 5 came to intervene\nand stood in between them in the hallway while trying to talk them\ndown and instructing them to go back into their rooms. When\n3",
    "Youth B was re-entering her room, she reported Staff 5 noticed\nYouth B had a bottle of hand sanitizer in her room. Staff 5 asked\nYouth B if the hand sanitizer had alcohol in it. Youth B said it did\nand Staff 5 told Youth B she was not supposed to have it. Youth B\nreported Staff 5 took the hand sanitizer from her, but Youth B\ngrabbed it back. Youth B reported Staff 5 did not grab it back from\nher again. While her bedroom door was still open, Youth B stated\nshe asked another youth if she could get drunk by drinking hand\nsanitizer with alcohol in it and the youth told her she could. Youth\nB reported Staff 5 left the room and came back about an hour\nlater. Staff 5 and other staff came to her room and took her heated\nblanket, soap, hand sanitizer, gel, glue sticks and a cup. Youth B\nreported the cup had a mix of hand sanitizer and water, which is\nwhat she was drinking after Staff 5 left the first time.\nTherapist was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/1/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker and via phone on 4/17/23.\nTherapist stated Youth B has not been on precautions since being\nat the facility. The hand sanitizer on the wall on the unit as well as\nin the staff office is non-alcoholic, but the hand sanitizer Youth B\nhad was the brand Purel, which is alcoholic. Therapist reported\nYouth B told her she received the hand sanitizer as a Christmas\ngift. Therapist reported typically the gifts would be checked prior to\nthe youth bringing them to their rooms, so she is not sure how the\nhand sanitizer ended up in Youth B’s room. Therapist reported\nwhen Youth A was found in the activity closet, she came out\nwillingly and voluntarily went to the hospital. Since coming back\nfrom the hospital, Youth A has been on high-risk precautions,\nwhich means she can only have her bedding, no access to items\nfor self-harm and increased supervision. Therapist stated prior to\nthis incident, Youth A had not been on precautions since 2/1/23.\nTherapist reported after Youth A was taken off of precautions on\n2/1/23, staff were instructed to monitor calls between Youth A and\nher family, monitor her behavior after calls, monitor her very\nclosely, and not allow her access to any of her personal sharp\nitems without supervision. Therapist reported Youth A’s personal\nsharp items were kept locked up in the staff office and Youth A\ncould request them and utilize them under staff supervision.\nTherapist also reported Youth A’s psychiatric appointments were\nincreased to weekly and as requested to address Youth A’s\nconcerns with her medications and make changes as deemed\nnecessary by the psychiatrist.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 3/8/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported she worked 2nd shift on\n2/26/23. When she started her shift, Youth A told Staff 1 she was\n4",
    "having negative thoughts, felt sad, and said she wished she could\noverdose. Staff 1 told Supervisor 1 about the feelings and\nthoughts Youth A was having. Supervisor 1 stated Youth A should\nnot have access to any sharps but did not give any other\ninstructions or put any other precautions in place. Staff 1 reported\nshe was in the kitchen helping two other youth with baking cookies\nwhile Supervisor 1, Staff 2 and Staff 5 were in the milieu area with\nthe rest of the youth, including Youth A. Staff 1 exited the kitchen\nto tell Youth A it was almost her turn to bake cookies. Staff 1 did\nnot see Youth A in the milieu, and no one knew where she was.\nStaff 1 reported she checked the TV room, bathroom, and\nbedroom twice, but Youth A was not in any of those rooms. Youth\nB then suggested staff check the activity closet, which is where\nStaff 5 found Youth A. Youth A told all staff the laundry soap\nburned in her throat and her stomach. Supervisor 1 called poison\ncontrol and followed their instructions. Afterwards, Youth A\nvoluntarily went to the hospital with Staff 1 and Staff 2 to ensure\nshe was okay. Staff 1 reported she could not remember if the\nactivity closet door was open or closed. She reported she thinks\nthe activity closet door is supposed to always be closed, but she\ncould not remember. She reported the youth can go into the\nactivity closet by themselves but are not allowed to go into the\nother closet inside the activity closet. Staff 1 was unsure how long\nYouth A was out of staffs’ viewpoint before they noticed Youth A\nwas missing.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 3/8/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported he came on shift around 6\npm on 2/26/23. Staff 2 stated everyone was finishing dinner,\ncleaning up and Staff 1 was in the kitchen with two youth baking\ncookies. Staff 2 reported Supervisor 1 was in the office preparing\nmedications for the youth and he and Staff 5 were in the milieu\narea with the rest of the youth. Staff 2 reported Youth A was sitting\nat the dining room table with a couple other youth and they were\nsinging songs and talking. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 came out of the\nkitchen and asked where Youth A was, which is when they all\nnoticed Youth A was no longer in the milieu. Staff 2 reported he\ndoes not know when Youth A left the milieu, is not sure how she\nleft the milieu without anyone noticing and is not sure how long\nshe was gone. Staff 2 reported Youth B suggested checking in the\nactivity closet, which is where Staff 5 found Youth A. Supervisor 1\ncalled poison control, they gave her food and milk per poison\ncontrol’s direction, and then Youth A voluntarily went to the\nhospital with Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 2 reported he did not see\nthe activity closet door open or propped, but the kitchen door was\nopen all the way, which blocks about half of the activity closet\n5",
    "door. Staff 2 stated the activity closet door is supposed to be\nclosed and is not supposed to be propped unless they’re cleaning\nor utilizing the laundry detergent for independent living skills.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 3/8/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported she worked 7am-3pm on\n2/26/23. Staff 3 reported she asked Staff 5 to clear the unit and\nput the mop buckets and cleaning supplies away. Staff 3 reported\nall the supplies either go into the activity closet or the closet inside\nthe activity closet. Staff 3 reported she was not sure if Staff 5\nclosed the activity closet door when she was done putting the\nitems away.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 3/8/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 stated she was the on-campus\nsupervisor the night of 2/26/23 and is responsible for responding\nto calls from various units. That evening she responded to a call\nrequesting assistance due to Youth B not giving up her bottle of\nhand sanitizer. When Staff 4 was on the unit, Youth B would not\ngive her the hand sanitizer the first time Staff 4 asked. The second\ntime Staff 4 asked for it, Youth B gave her the hand sanitizer\nbottle, but it was cloudy and did not seem like it was hand\nsanitizer. Staff 4 looked in Youth B’s room and found some hand\nsanitizer in a cup combined with water. When Staff 4 asked Youth\nB if she drank it, Youth B confirmed she did. Staff 4 proceeded to\ncall poison control and attempted to treat Youth B per their\nrecommendations, but Youth B refused to comply.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 3/24/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 5 reported during staff debrief\nbetween 1st and 2nd shift, Staff 3 told her not to prop any doors\nopen and be mindful of her surroundings because Youth A was\nupset, and they did not want Youth A to harm herself. Staff 5\nreported she put the mop and cleaning stuff away in the activity\ncloset and the closet within the activity closet. She stated after she\nput them away, the door shut and locked automatically. She\nreported she does not remember where Youth A was in the milieu\narea after dinner, but stated she was sitting on a couch with two\nyouth and her back was facing the dining table. After it was\nlearned Youth A was missing, Staff 5 found Youth A in the activity\ncloset. Staff 5 reported Youth A did not have anything in her hand\nand did not have any laundry soap or laundry soap containers\naround her when she found her. Staff 5 does not know how Youth\nA got into the activity closet because it is typically left shut and\nlocked. Staff 5 could not provide an estimated time for how long\nYouth A was gone before staff noticed she was missing. After\n6",
    "Youth A was taken to the hospital, Staff 5 heard Youth B and\nanother youth yelling at each other, so she went to intervene. She\nstood in the hallway between the youths’ bedrooms and was trying\nto deescalate them. She noticed Youth B had hand sanitizer, so\nshe asked Youth B about it. Youth B then threw the hand sanitizer\nin her clothes and refused to give it to Staff 5. Staff 5 felt the only\nway to get the hand sanitizer would be to restrain Youth B, which\nshe did not want to do. Staff 5 stated she was going to tell\nSupervisor 1 what was going on when she heard Youth B ask\nanother youth if she could get drunk by drinking hand sanitizer\nwith alcohol in it. The other youth told Youth B she could. Staff 5\nleft the area, told Supervisor 1 what was happening. Supervisor 1\ncalled Staff 4 and asked for additional assistance. Staff 5 reported\nshe was away from Youth B’s room for approximately 5 minutes\nbefore she then went back to Youth B’s room to check on her.\nStaff 5 reported she looked in the window of Youth B’s room and\nYouth B was calm and was not doing anything at the time she\ncame back so she stood in the hallway until Staff 4 arrived. Staff 5\nreported she did not have Youth B’s bedroom door propped open\nand was not directly observing her the whole time while waiting for\nStaff 4. Staff 5 reported Staff 4 arrived about 10-15 minutes later\nand retrieved the hand sanitizer from Youth B.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via phone on 3/8/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker and again on 4/12/23.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A finished a Zoom call during 1st shift\non 2/26/23 and was acting a little different. Supervisor 1 reported\nStaff 1 never told her Youth A stated she felt bad, was having\nnegative thoughts, and wished she could overdose. Supervisor 1\nreported Staff 1 told her Youth A seemed upset, but it is not\nunusual for a youth to feel upset after a phone call with family.\nSupervisor 1 asked Youth A if she was okay and Youth A said yes\nand asked for scissors to take down her hair. Supervisor 1 asked\nStaff 1 to assist Youth A so Youth A would not have access to any\nsharps because Youth A can be unpredictable, especially when\nshe is upset. Supervisor 1 also asked staff to put away the mop\nbuckets, so Staff 5 and another staff put away the buckets in the\ncloset within the activity closet. Supervisor 1 noted Staff 5 was the\nlast one she saw in the activity closet, so Staff 5 must not have\nshut the door fully. Supervisor 1 reported when the kitchen door is\nopen, it covers about half of the activity closet doorway, so it is\nhard to see if the activity room door was fully closed or not.\nSupervisor 1 reported after dinner, Staff 1 was assisting with a\nbaking activity in the kitchen while Staff 2 and Staff 5 were in the\nmilieu with the youth and Supervisor 1 was in the office.\nSupervisor 1 reported she last saw Youth A at the dining table.\n7",
    "Supervisor 1 reported staff found Youth A in the activity closet.\nSupervisor 1 noted when staff were talking to Youth A in the\nactivity closet, the activity door was propped open, but she did not\nsee it propped open prior to that time. Youth A reported she drank\n2 handfuls of laundry detergent. Supervisor 1 called poison control\nand nursing. Supervisor 1 noted after the incident, they removed\nall objects like silverware, pop cans, and paper from the unit.\nYouth A then went to the hospital with Staff 1 and Staff 2.\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 5 stripped Youth A’s room while she was at\nthe hospital as she was being placed on high-risk precautions\nafter she returned from the hospital. Supervisor 1 reported Youth\nA was not on any suicide precaution risk status prior to this\nincident occurring. Supervisor 1 was not in the milieu and was not\nsure how long Youth A was out of staff supervision before they\nnoticed she was missing. Supervisor 1 reported she was on the\nphone with poison control for the situation regarding Youth A\nwhen she heard a commotion down the bedroom hallway. She\nreported she contacted Staff 4 and asked for additional\nassistance. Supervisor 1 reported she went into the hallway and\nsaw Staff 5 standing between the two rooms. Supervisor 1\nreported they attempted to enter Youth B’s room, but Youth B had\nstuff propped up against the door, making it difficult for them to\nenter. Supervisor 1 stated Youth B also had her mattress against\nthe door, covering half of the window to the bedroom door.\nSupervisor 1 stated after Staff 4 arrived, Staff 4 was able to talk\nYouth B into moving the items away from the door so staff could\nopen the door. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 5 never left the hallway\nand Staff 5 remained there during the duration of the incident.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via phone on 3/8/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 2 was not working\nwhen the incidents occurred on 2/26/23, but she is the Home\nSupervisor and leads staff meetings, sends out staff notifications,\netc. Supervisor 2 reported the activity closet door should be\nlocked if it is shut and should never be propped open. Supervisor\n2 reported this has been discussed in team meetings and emails\nhave been sent out explaining staff should not prop the activity\ncloset door open due to safety concerns. Supervisor 2 reported\nnew staff are trained about the same guidelines during orientation.\nSupervisor 2 reported when Youth A first entered the program,\nthey knew she would scratch herself to self-harm, but found out\nwithin the first 3 weeks Youth A would utilize anything at her\ndisposal to self-harm. Supervisor 2 reported this information was\ndiscussed with staff and staff were instructed to be even more\nvigilant, not to leave access to the activity closet, etc. Supervisor 2\nreported they talk about not leaving the activity closet door open\n8",
    "for safety in general but wanted staff to know there needed to be\nheightened awareness due to Youth A’s self-harm history.\nSupervisor 2 reported there is not a policy stating the door must\nbe locked and there is no sign on the door saying it cannot be\npropped, but it is expected staff are always monitoring it.\nSupervisor 2 reported liquids the youth receive (such as hand\nsanitizer, shampoo, body wash, perfume, and lotions) should not\nbe in youths’ rooms and should be kept in the staff office.\nSupervisor 2 reported Youth B and another youth both had bottles\nof hand sanitizer in their rooms, which should have been taken so\nshe’s not sure how they got the hand sanitizer or how the hand\nsanitizer ended up in the youths’ rooms.
