METHODOLOGY\n11/10/2003 Enrollment\n11/18/2003 Comment\nTransferred entire LU file to Saginaw\n03/19/2004 Inspection Completed On-site\n04/16/2004 Inspection Completed-BFS Full Compliance\nIII. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nAt the time of the onsite visit the office space that is to be utilized was undergoing\nrenovations. The office space at 4008 W. Wackerly, Midland, MI 48640 is newly leased\nspace. It consists of two rooms located in a small office complex. The first room is a\nsmall reception area with a doorway leading to a small hall. The hall leads to a large\nroom that will be more than adequate to meet the early needs of this child placing\nagency. Although the office furniture was not in place the desks were identified and\nlocked cabinets are provided for all confidential records.\nB. Program Description\nAdoption Option, Inc. is a new child placing agency licensed by the State of Michigan for\nevaluating homes for adoptions, supervising adoptive placements, certifying homes for\nfoster care licensure, placing children in foster homes, and supervising independent\nliving.\nThe priority for this program is the evaluation of families for adoptive placements and\nthe supervision of adoptive placements. It is the desire of the program administrator to\nevaluate and match prospective adoptive families with permanent state wards that are\nregistered in the MARE book to achieve permanence in a timelier manner. The other\nchild placing activities and terms are initially in place to serve in a support role for this\npriority as needed.\nInitial services will be provided through the use of contractual individuals with\nqualifications consistent with the services and in compliance with the applicable\nlicensing rules. The individuals that are projected to provide these services meet the\nqualifications and standards established by the applicable licensing rules.\n2",
    "C. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe proposed policies and procedures are in compliance with all applicable licensing\nrules at this time.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is the recommendation of this consultant that Adoption Option, Inc. be issued a 1st\nprovisional license as a child placing agency with the terms to certify foster homes\nfor licensure, receive children for placement in licensed foster homes, supervise\nindependent living placements, evaluate applicants for adoption and place and\nsupervise children with adoptive parents.\n________________________________________\nMark R.
