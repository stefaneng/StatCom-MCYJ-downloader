Youth C was picked\nup by Staff 2 with one arm around his chest.\nINVESTIGATION:\nIncident One:\nOn 1/14/2022 it was reported to DCWL that a staff person (Staff 1) left two children\nunattended in a vehicle, without heat for approximately 15 minutes. This reportedly\noccurred on 1/13/2022. The source further stated the temperature was 32 degrees\nthat day and the children were not wearing coats. Staff 1 left the children in the car\nto assist Staff 2 with a child that was kicking the seat of another car. The source\nstated this information was also reported to DHHS and Law Enforcement.\n2",
    "Chief Administrator\nOn 1/14/22 the agency Chief Administrator (CA) was contacted and informed of the\ninvestigation. The CA reported she was aware of the alleged incident.\nOn 1/18/22 interviews were completed on-site. The Chief Administrator was present\nduring staff interviews. After the interviews concluded, the CA reported the agency\nwas in the process of reviewing the information and determining a course of action.\nIn the meantime, the agency took the following steps:\n Staff 1 documented the incident in an incident report.\n Staff did a well-child check with both children over the weekend after the\nalleged incident.\n Staff 1 was interviewed regarding the incident by the program manager.\nThe CA reported this case has been challenging as one of the parents can make\nvisits difficult at times. At the end of visits at the parent’s home, the kids will get\nupset and not want to leave. The parent will yell at the agency staff that it is their\nfault. Sometimes the kids will hit and kick at the workers in an attempt to prevent\nleaving. The parent will encourage the kids to try to get away from staff. The parent\nalso refuses to help staff transition the children at the end of the visit.\nStaff 1\nOn 1/18/22 Staff 1 was interviewed at the agency. Staff 1 stated she was aware of\nthe allegations, as the parent made it known they would make a report. Staff 1\nreported that visits with the parent are always challenging as one of the children has\nissues with the transition when it is time to leave the visit. On 1/13/22 Staff 1 was\nwaiting with Youth A (age 2) after a visit. Youth A was crying because the parent\nwould not walk out to the car with them. Staff 1 was able to convince Youth A to go\nto the car for a snack the parent provided. Staff 1 put Youth A and Youth B (age 3) in\nher car. Both youth had their coats on and were buckled in their seats. Staff 1 got in\nthe car, started it, then noticed the parent was standing at the window yelling, and\nrecording the worker with her phone. The parent was yelling at Staff 1 that she was\n“trafficking children”. Staff 1 stated this claim is something the parent frequently\nstates.\nAlso occurring at this time, Youth C (age 6) was getting into Staff 2’s car. Staff 2\nrequested assistance, as Youth C was kicking the door, causing it to hit the adjacent\ncar. Staff 1 took the keys out of her car and walked over to assist Staff 2. Staff 2 was\nin the parking spot next to Staff 1. Staff 2 was blocking the car door from hitting the\nnext car. Staff 1 returned to her car to ask Youth A and B if they were ok. Youth B\nstated he was scared. Staff 1 reassured him and put a movie on to keep the two\nchildren distracted from their sibling’s behavior. Staff 1 stated she put the key back\nin the car to power the movie, but the car was not started. Staff 1 reported that she\ntried to help Staff 2 deescalate Youth C by talking with him. Staff 1 was standing\nbetween her car and Staff 1’s car, with the door open, so she could speak with\nYouth C. Staff 1 asked if Youth C wanted to speak with his parent. However, the\n3",
    "parent had returned to her apartment. Staff 1 called the parent, but the parent yelled\nout the window that she would not answer the phone, stating she needed the phone\nto call and report the worker. Staff 1 asked Youth C if he wanted to speak with his\ngrandmother. Youth C agreed and calmed down while speaking to his grandmother.\nThe incident lasted about 10-15 minutes. Staff 1 reported she was standing next to\nher car and checked on Youth A and B approximately 2-3 times. Both children\nseemed comfortable watching a movie. Staff 1 stated the kids never reported being\ncold or uncomfortable.\nStaff 2\nStaff 2 was interviewed regarding the incident on 1/13/22 with a follow-up phone call\non 2/16/22. Staff 2’s account matched that of Staff 1. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was\nstanding in-between the cars, talking with Youth C for 5-10 minutes. Youth A and B\nwere in Staff 1’s car at the time. Staff 1 never left her car unattended.\nDocuments reviewed\nStaff 1’s Human Resources file was reviewed. Staff 1 did not have any prior\ndisciplinary action or concerns documented. Staff 1 had completed required training,\nincluding de-escalation training within the past year.\nAn incident report dated 1/13/22 was reviewed and found to reflect the information\nprovided by Staff 1 during the 1/18/22 interview.\nA review of National Weather Service records found the temperature at the parent’s\napartment on 1/13/22 was 37 degrees. With or without coats on, and sitting in a car,\nthe children were not at risk of hypothermia during the 10-15 minute incident, per the\nNational Weather Service Hypothermia Chart.\nIncident Two\nOn 1/14/22 it was reported to DCWL that around December 2021, Youth A was\ndragged off of a couch and onto the floor by Staff 2, during visitation with the child’s\nparent. Staff 2 then dragged the child halfway down the stairs. Staff 2 then picked up\nYouth C with one hand around his chest/torso and carried him down the stairs and\nout of the apartment complex. It was unknown if Youth C was injured. No witnesses\nwere identified.\nChief Administrator\nOn 1/14/22 phone contact occurred with the CA to initiate the investigation. On\n1/18/22 face to face contact occurred with the CA, as she was present for staff\ninterviews. In addition, a pre-exit call occurred on 2/16/22.\nThe CA reported the agency understood the serious nature of the complaint and\ncompleted the following steps to address the situation:\n A review of visits was completed and the agency determined the incident to\nhave occurred on 11/4/21, not December 2021. An incident report was\nprovided to DCWL.\n4",
    " On 11/11/21 after an initial report that Staff 2 picked up a child during a visit,\nStaff 2 met with administration and received additional de-escalation training.\n Staff 2 was removed from assisting with Youth C’s visits, pending this\ninvestigation.\n Staff 1 completed a well child check with Youth C after receiving the\nallegation.\n Staff 2 discussed the situation with their supervisor and Human Resources.\n Staff 2 reviewed the video with her supervisor and discussed points in which\nshe could have reacted differently. Staff 2 recognized the mistakes she made\nand was receptive to education in those areas.\n A behavioral health specialist from the agency began attending visits for this\nfamily and helping establish routines to make transitions easier. Coaching\nabout cues, routines, and proactive actions was utilized.\n Additional training and supervision are planned for Staff 2, including further\nde-escalation training, visit coaching, and crisis intervention training. This\ninformation will be outlined in a Corrective Action Plan for DCWL.\nStaff 2\nOn 1/18/22 an interview was completed with Staff 2 at the agency. Staff 2 reported\nbeing a visitation specialist/case aid for one year. Staff 2 was informed of the\nallegation and reported she believed the complaint stemmed from a visit on 11/4/21.\nStaff 2 denied pulling Youth C off the couch or dragging him anywhere. Staff 2\nreported she was supervising a visit with Staff 1 at the parental home of Youth C.\nAfter the family ate dinner, Youth C became upset about not being able to use his\ntablet. While in the living room, Youth C’s behavior escalated. The behavior\ncontinued for the duration of the visit. As they neared the end of the visit, Youth C\nbegan hitting, kicking, throwing objects, and spitting. The parent tried ignoring the\nbehavior, then held Youth C for a few minutes, but he did not calm down. Staff 2\nstated she gave some verbal cues to Youth C, such as “let’s get shoes on”, to let\nhim know it was almost time to go. Youth C ignored Staff 2. Staff 1 was trying to\nassist with Youth C, but she was also attempting to get Youth A and Youth B ready\nto go. Staff 2 ran out to the car to put Youth C’s belongings in it. When Staff 2 came\nback in Staff 1 was ready to go with Youth A and B. Youth C was covered in a\nblanket, sitting on the couch. Staff 2 removed the blanket, took Youth C’s hand, and\nsaid let’s go. Youth C then slid off the couch on to the floor. Staff 1 stated he slid on\nhis own, as she did not pull him. Staff 2 continued trying to talk with Youth C and\nencouraged him to get up to leave. Staff 2 stated that she waited for a few minutes,\nbut Youth C was not making any effort to leave. Staff 2 then “scooped him up and\ncarried him out”. The parent was already outside of the apartment at that time, in\nthe hallway, yelling at Staff 1. The parent saw Staff 2 carrying Youth C into the\nhallway. The parent asked Staff 2 to put him down, stating, “you’re hurting him”.\nStaff 2 set Youth C down. Youth C began grabbing the spindles of the staircase,\nrefusing to leave. Staff 1 asked Youth C if he wanted to talk to his grandmother\nwhen they got in the car. This suggestion upset the parent. Staff 1 then began\nmoving outside to get Youth A and B loaded into her car. During this time, other\npeople were attempting to use the stairs. Staff 2 stated she thought about trying to\n5",
    "take Youth C’s hands off the spindles to keep him from blocking the stairs. However,\nthe parent was already upset and making allegations. Therefore, Staff 2 decided she\ndid not want to touch Youth C. A few moments later, Youth C let go of the spindles.\nStaff 2 picked up Youth C and took him the rest of the way down the stairs and out\nto the car. Youth C was cooperating once they were outside. Youth C was helpful in\nputting his socks, shoes, and coat on in the car. Youth C put on his seatbelt without\nfurther incident. Youth C did not make any complaints about being hurt. Staff 2\nclarified that when she picked up Youth C, she was behind him and put her arm\naround the front of his chest/waist. Staff 1 was at the bottom of the stairs, exiting\nwith the other children at that time.\nVideo reviewed\nA three-part video of the 11/4/21 incident was reviewed and found the following:\n Youth C was wrapped in a blanket sitting on the couch. The parent told Youth\nC he had to leave. Youth C would not let go of the blanket as Staff 2 tried to\nmove it. Staff 2 picked the blanket up, with Youth C still holding on, and set\nthe blanket and child on the floor. Staff 2 then removed the blanket from\nYouth C’s hands. Staff 2 attempted to stand Youth C up, but he went limp and\nsat on the floor. After the second attempt, Staff 2 picked up Youth C with one\narm across his shoulder and around his chest and began carrying him out of\nthe apartment. When they reached the hallway, the parent asked Staff 2 not\nto hold Youth C that way, because Staff 2 was hurting him. Staff 2 set Youth\nC on the floor at the top of the steps.\n Staff 2 attempted to pick Youth C up from the front. But Youth C grabbed the\nrailing. Staff 2 attempted to remove his hands from the railing. Then sat Youth\nC on the step and tried to get him to go down the stairs. Youth C began going\nback up the stairs, with Staff 2 holding his hands. Staff 2 told Youth C she\nwas sorry, but they had to go. Youth C continued to struggle to release his\nhands from Staff 2.\n Staff 2 let go of Youth C’s hands and he grabbed the railing again. Staff 2\npulled Youth C’s hand from the railing and picked him up from behind, with\nher arms around his torso. Another resident of the building then excused\nhimself past them and up the stairs. Youth C then grabbed the railing again.\nThe parent stated she was no longer going to help, due to a prior incident\nwhere she was upset with staff. The parent told staff they need to figure it out.\nYouth C continued to hold the railing. The parent said, “I’m sorry (Youth C), I\ncan’t help you”. The parent told Youth C it was Staff 1’s fault he had to go.\nStaff 2 removed his hands from the railing again and Youth C sat on the step.\nStaff 1 asked Youth C if he wanted to talk to his grandma. The parent\nobjected to Youth C speaking with his grandma because the parent felt the\nstaff should handle the situation on their own. Staff 2 then picked up Youth C\nin a cradle hold and walked out the door while he continued to struggle.\nDocuments reviewed\n Staff 2’s Human Resources file was reviewed. Staff 2 received de-escalation\ntraining on 8/17/21 and 11/11/21.\n6",
    " Incident Report dated 11/4/21: The incident report was consistent with the\ninformation provided by Staff 2 during the interview on 1/18/22. After this\nincident occurred, Staff 2 was coached by her supervisor about agency\nexpectations. Staff 2 reviewed de-escalation and safety technique training on\n11/11/21. On 11/15/21 Staff 2 met with the supervisor again to discuss tools\nshe learned from the training and how she could have used them in the\n11/4/21 situation. Staff 2 was receptive to learning how to better handle this\nsituation. Staff 2 was also encouraged by her supervisor to reach out for\nassistance when needed, so they may work together to develop a plan.\n Incident report 1/25/21: A child reported to Staff 2 that she was hit by her\nparent. Staff 2 reported the information to her supervisor. The supervisor\ncoached Staff 2 that she needed to report the information directly to DHHS.\nAdditional mandated reporter training was completed by Staff 2 in January\nand August 2021.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: No violation was found as there was not evidence to indicate\nStaff 1 acted in an unsafe manner during incident one.\nA violation was found for incident two due to Staff 2 using\nphysical management with Youth C on several occasions during\nthe 11/4/21 visitation. Staff 2 was observed on video to move\nthe child from the couch to the floor, pull the youth’s hands from\na railing several times, hold the youth’s hands to prevent him\nfrom going upstairs, and picked the youth up in an effort to\nrelocate him on three occasions. Physical management is not to\nbe used by CPA staff in this manner. Staff are not trained in\nphysical management.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
