DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of independent living services. All files will be stored securely and there is\na cross shredder for CHRI. The office space is a designated area of the\napplicant’s residential home. The home is located in a modern subdivision. The\nhome is relatively new, well maintained, and the designated office space is more\nthan adequate to meet the needs of providing administrative functions for\nindependent living services.\n3",
    "B. Program Description\nAs a nonprofit IRS 501(c)3 corporation serving youth 12-18, GYS operates to\neffect change through multiple approaches, including but not limited to:\nmentorship, empowerment, mental health and wellness, life skills, and pro-social\nactivities. Genesis Youth Services, Incorporated’s Independent Living Plus (ILP)\nProgram helps youth transition from residential or foster care to self-sufficiency in\nthe community through limited interventions. The Independent Living Plus (ILP)\nProgram helps 16–18-year-olds who are not yet ready for General Independent\nLiving (IL) by providing them with staff-supported housing and other services. The\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Probate Court, Circuit Court, and\nother partnering programs make the majority of referrals to ILP. Youth receive\nfinancial help from state/county funds granted by DHHS/CMO contract. It is\nrequired that all youth will be either in school or employed. Youth must\ndemonstrate a capacity for and willingness to learn independent living skills in a\nsupported, structured ILP Program before transitioning into another living\narrangement. ILP serves to meet the youth’s specific independent living needs\nand goals until he/she can step down to IL. The duration of the ILP Program will\nvary as determined by the youth’s assessment of needs and strengths. The ILP\nplacement will not last longer than twelve months of initial intake without an\napproved exception request from the referral source, (i.e. DHHS/CMO), and\ncannot extend past the youth’s twentieth birthday\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThey agency is found in compliance with licensing rules.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on substantial compliance with the rules, it is recommended that a six-month\noriginal license be issued.\n________________________________May 15, 2025\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 20, 2025\n_______________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
