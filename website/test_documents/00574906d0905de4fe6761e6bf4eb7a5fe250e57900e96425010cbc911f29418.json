    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted following allegations that two residents, Youth A and Youth B, engaged in non-consensual sexual touching while under staff supervision in a group home dining area. The investigation found that two staff members were present and supervising at the time, but their attention was divided due to concerns about a potential vaping incident and administrative duties. Ultimately, the state concluded the facility was in compliance with staffing rules, as the staff were physically present and had a direct line of sight, and therefore no violation was established. Despite this finding, the report suggests staff supervision was inadequate as they were focused on paperwork and a secondary concern, which allowed the incident to occur unnoticed.",
