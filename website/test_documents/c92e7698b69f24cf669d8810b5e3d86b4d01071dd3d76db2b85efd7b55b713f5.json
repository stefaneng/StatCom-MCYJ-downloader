Complainant said, Foster Parent, told her things about the\nbirth mother’s living situation and she nor the birth mother\ninformed Foster Parent of that information. Complainant said\nFoster Parent is always asking her questions about the birth\nmother and she either ignores Foster Parent or directs Foster\nParent to the agency. Complainant reported Foster Parent told her\nshe and DHHS Worker talk all the time. That DHHS Worker told\nher birth mother can’t get into an abuse center or shelter.\nComplainant reported there was also a time that the birth mother\nwas in the hospital and Foster Parent asked her why, then stated,\n“I already know, DHHS Worker told me”. Complainant was unable\nto speak to why Foster Parent would tell her that information or\nwhy DHHS Worker would share such information. Complainant\nreported not knowing if DHHS Worker and Foster Parent are\nfriends but thought they might be friends on Facebook.\nComplainant was not aware of DHHS Worker sharing specific\nconfidential information to Foster Parent, giving Foster Parent the\nbirth mother’s address, social security information or other\nidentifiable type of confidential information. She reported just\nbeing concerned that Foster Parent is asking her so many\nquestions that she just wants someone to talk with Foster Parent\nand ask Foster Parent to stop asking her information. She said\nshe has reported this concern to her supervisor in the past.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nOn 10/2/2024 I spoke with CA about this allegation by telephone.\nCA reported not being aware of such allegations pertaining to\nDHHS Worker. CA reported with respect to Child A’s and Child B’s\n2",
    "case there was a matter they had to address related to a situation\nwith the child placing agency’s (CPA) contractual person. That\nperson was sharing information about the case to the foster parent\nand so, they referred the matter to that agency to address it.\nCA reported DHHS Worker has been with Arenac DHHS for about\na year, and there have been no concerns or professional issues\nreported related to DHHS Worker’s work or her interactions with\nothers. She said DHHS Worker came to them from a private\nagency, and that agency did not report any professional concerns\nor inappropriate behaviors for DHHS Worker. She said DHHS\nWorker had not reached out to her with concerns that the\nchildren’s foster parent has been trying to get too much\ninformation on the children’s birth mother. Nor has DHHS Worker\nrequested guidance on how to handle such a matter. CA said\nDHHS Worker’s supervisor would be more abreast of something\nlike that.\nFoster Parent\nOn 10/4/2024 I interviewed Foster Parent by telephone. Foster\nParent reported DHHS Worker updates her on her foster\nchildren’s case by way of family team meetings or reporting at\ncourt hearings. She reported that most of the information she gets\non the case comes from Person X, who provides transportation for\nChild A and Child B’s and has been involved in their case since\n6/13/2024. She said DHHS Worker will tell her information she\nneeds to know, such as when parenting times are, when they get\ncancelled, and FTM and court hearing dates. She denied DHHS\nWorker sharing confidential or personal information about the birth\nmother with her. She denied she and DHHS Worker having a\nrelationship other than worker and caregiver. She reported that\nPerson X tells her many things, such as where the birth mother\nlives, works and that birth mother missed a drug test. Additionally,\nPerson X has stated in the past that if the children should come up\nfor adoption she has lots of people who would want to adopt. As\nrecent as today, Person X told her if birth mother continues to do\ngood, birth mother will get unsupervised visits. Foster Parent said\nDHHS Worker had yet to informed her of that information. She\nwas not sure whether Person X was supposed to have shared that\ninformation with her. She said Person X never told her whether it\nwas okay or not okay for Person X to tell her the things Person X\nreported about the birth mother. Foster Parent denied asking\nPerson X for any of the information. She also reported knowing\nthat Person X was telling the birth mother information about her.\nThat Person X told the birth mother she only lives four to five\nminutes from the birth mother.\n3",
    "Department of Health & Human Service (DHHS) Supervisor\nOn 10/4/2024 I interviewed DHHS Supervisor by telephone. She\nreported no knowledge of such an allegation pertaining to DHHS\nWorker. Nor did she believe the allegation to be creditable. She\nreported there being no actions or behavior by DHHS Worker that\nwould cause her to think DHHS Worker would share confidential\ninformation about Child A and Child B’s birth parent or any birth\nparent. She said DHHS Worker is not a new worker to the field.\nDHHS Worker has been professional in her work and has had no\ndisciplinary actions. Nor had it ever been reported to her that\nDHHS Worker and Foster Parent were friends, personally or on\nFacebook.\nDHHS Supervisor affirmed information as reported by the CA\nrelated to there being a person with a contracted agency who was\nsharing information with the foster parent. She reported this\nperson, whom she named as Person X, was also sharing\ninformation with the birth mother on the foster mother. She said\nthat issue came up a while ago and they addressed it with the\nagency. She said she and DHHS Worker meet often, and DHHS\nWorker has never reported that Person X had shared a concern\nwith her that Foster Parent was asking questions or trying to get\ninformation from her on the birth parent. She reported if that had\nbeen the case, DHHS Worker would have told her. She confirmed\ninformation reported by Foster Parent about Person X sharing with\nthe birth mother that birth mother and Foster Parent only live four\nto five minutes away from each other. DHHS Supervisor further\nreported that there have been other issues with Person X, and\nperhaps I should speak with the Community Resource\nCoordinator who facilitates contract transportation services with\nthe agency.\nDepartment Of Social Service (DHHS)Worker\nOn 10/10/2024 I interviewed DHHS Worker by telephone. She\ndenied the allegations. She reported she communicates with\nFoster Parent mostly via foster home visits. She said she obtains\ninformation from Foster Parent on the children’s care and gets\nupdates about school or other matters. She gives Foster Parent\nupdates on how the children’s parenting time is going, and on\nscheduling parenting times so that Foster Parent can plan her\nday. She reported the birth mother has personally disclosed\ninformation to Foster Parent, such as where she lives. That Foster\nParent has given the birth mother a ride home but that type of\ninformation, nor other personal or confidential information about\nthe birth mother to Foster Parent has not come from her. She\n4",
    "said Foster Parent has shared information with her about the birth\nmother that she did not know. Foster Parent told her birth mother\nwas getting kicked out of her housing, which Foster Parent\nreported Person X told her.\nDHHS Worker admitted there would have been a time it was\ndiscussed that the birth mother was in the hospital, but that\ninformation was reported at a court and during an FTM where both\nthe birth mother and Foster Parent were present for. DHHS\nWorker also reported birth mother and Foster Parent get along,\ncommunicate well when they see each other and they may have\nshared information about themselves with the other.\nCommunity Resource Coordinator (CRC)\nOn 10/10/2024 I interviewed CRC by telephone. She confirmed\ninformation related to concerns being reported for Person X.\nCRC reported it has been reported Person X can be very friendly\nwith clients, which can be good, but Person X has tended to be\noverly friendly, and she may inadvertently or otherwise share too\nmuch information. CRC reported she has spoken with Person X’s\nagency about this matter. CRC also acknowledged there was\nanother issue whereby Person X was asked to be taken off a case\nby an attorney, but CRC did not know the reason behind that.\nCRC denied either Person X or Person X’s supervisor ever\nreporting to her that DHHS Worker had shared confidential\ninformation about a birth mother with a foster parent.\nReviewed\nChild A and Child B’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• They entered care on 2/24/2024 and are temporary court\nwards.\n• They were placed in Foster Parent’s foster home on\n6/13/2024 and this is their third foster home placement.\n• Social work contacts of case contacts and face-to face\ncontacts between DHHS Worker and Foster Parent from\n6/13/2024- 9/13/2024 which did not show indication that\nconfidential information on the birth mother was shared by\nDHHS Worker.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation reviewed the evidence\ndoes not support the allegations or a lack of responsible character\nsuitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
