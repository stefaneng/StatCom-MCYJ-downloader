The report does not have any additional\ninformation.\n• Henry Ford Fairlane ER discharge summary dated for\n10/26/2019: Youth A was diagnosed with Closed Salter-\nHarris Type II physeal fracture of left distal radius.\n• Emergency Medical Policy:\n• Treatment Standards and Expectations\no To provide optimal, quality care for our high-risk, special\nneeds children, it is essential that all personnel employed\nby the Christ Child House conduct themselves in a highly\nprofessional manner to carry out their respective duties and\nresponsibilities. We must understand that first we are a\ntreatment center, not a home and that we are also a haven\nfor abused children, so everything needs to be taken in the\ncontext of that.\no Although it is impossible to delineate every detail of how we\nneed to perform our jobs professionally, the following\nguidelines are intended to convey many of the important\nparameters within which we all need to function to\neffectively carry out our jobs.\no I. Responsibilities of Staff:\no All staff on duty are responsible for the proper treatment\nand safety of all children.\no All staff are responsible for providing a nurturing, supportive\nand treatment oriented environment for all residents. In\norder to create and maintain this type of environment, staff\nwill work to develop strong therapeutic relationships with\nthe children under their care. These relationships will be\nbuilt in part by: 1) ensuring that the basic needs (e.g., food,\nclothing, adequate sleep, safety and medical care) of all\nresidents are satisfactorily met; 2) helping and teaching the\nchildren to solve problems rather than to bottle them up\nand/or act them out;\no Staff will provide positive feedback to children for their\nachievements. Similarly, staff will provide critical feedback\nto residents in a constructive and respectful manner to\nmotivate more appropriate and positive growth-producing\nbehavior from them. Staff must be positive role models at\nall times.\n9",
    "o To provide a therapeutic and safe environment, staff will\nintervene as necessary when acting out behavior(s) occur.\nAll interventions will begin with the least restrictive one\npossible.\no It may be necessary at times for staff to intervene with\nphysical management, but only to protect a child from\nimminent dangers to themselves or others and always as a\nlast resort. At all times staff will obtain supervisory\nauthorization, use the least restrictive physical\nmanagement technique, and log the incident on a physical\nmanagement form during the shift worked. When staff\nhave been involved in the physical restraint of a child, all\nstaff directly involved must record the circumstances of the\nintervention. The logging of such an event will include a\ndescription of the circumstances leading up to the use of\nphysical restraint, a description of the intervention itself,\nand a description of the problem involved during the\nrestraint, along with an account of its resolution and\nsubsequent processing with the child.\no Staff will be responsible for helping our children\nappropriately present themselves by ensuring they are\ngroomed properly, dressed neatly and appropriately for the\nweather/occasion. Staff should also ensure that the boys\ndo not take any inappropriate materials to school (clothing\nchanges, MP3’s, radios, money).\no Staff will be made aware of treatment expectations for the\nboys to allow them to properly address their behaviors.\no Staff are responsible to be knowledgeable of the resident’s\nde-escalation forms, which are located in the Supervisor\nOffice in a binder labeled Resident De-escalation Forms.\no II. Prohibitions\no Physical or corporal punishment is prohibited with our\nchildren in any situation. In a treatment center,\nconsequences are to be used for misbehavior, not\npunishment. Punishment is never therapeutic, logical and\nnatural consequences are.\no Excessive or inappropriate use of force or restraint should\nnever be used with our children. Any intervention must\nadhere to the guidelines of the agency’s Restraint Policy.\nRestraints must never be utilized in bathrooms or on\nstairwells or other dangerous areas. It is the philosophy of\nChrist Child House that discipline is an educational process\nof establishing and teaching an orderly way of life. This will\nprotect and maintain the integrity of the individual, the\nagency, and will be acceptable to society. Discipline is not\n10",
    "a procedure applied to an individual because his behavior\nhas displeased someone in authority; that is punishment.\no Appropriate methods of behavior management include but\nare not limited to time-outs, loss of privileges, chores,\nredirection and behavioral contracts. Behavioral\nmanagement methods should always be appropriate to the\nage of the child.\no The following techniques are prohibited:\no Any form of corporal punishment or physical force\n(including the use of a switch, belt, paddle, extension cord\nor other objects to strike a child).\no Restricting a child’s movements by binding or tying him/her.\no Application of any substance, which would cause a child to\nbe burned.\no Confining a child in an area such as a closet, locked room,\nbox or similar cubicle.\no Withholding necessary food, rest or toilet use.\no Mental or emotional cruelty, such as humiliating, shaming,\nor frightening a child this includes threatening harm or\nswearing/cursing (using foul language) at them.\no Verbal abuse, threats or derogatory remarks.\no Corporal punishment inflicted in any manner, including\nspanking or slapping.\no The depriving of visits or other contact with the child’s\nbiological family as a form of punishment.\no Any kind of purposefully inflicted physical discomfort such\nas marching, standing rigidly in one spot for extended\nperiods, depriving the child of sleep or forcing food.\no Denial of necessary educational, medical, counseling or\nsocial services work.\no Any form of physical, emotional or sexual abuse.\no Child handling techniques used should assist the youth in\nunderstanding their behavior and promoting self-control,\nself-esteem and independence and must be positive and\nconsistent based on the child’s needs and stage of\ndevelopment. Discipline and child handling techniques are\nrecorded in the Treatment Plan and Service Agreement.\nThe techniques must be child specific.\no Staff may use reasonable restraint to prevent imminent\nharm to self or others. Remember to exhaust all other\nefforts before placing hands on.\no A child is never to be placed in seclusion. No children\nshould ever be sent to a room unescorted. Children are to\nbe supervised at all times.\n11",
    "o Staff should never allow a child to be verbally or physically\naggressive with a peer. Teach and encourage the children\nto treat each other respectfully.\no Meals and snacks, including desserts should never be\nwithheld as a means of punishment or consequence. Food\nis a right not a privilege and critically important to an child.\nThe only dietary restrictions are those dictated by a doctor\nor agency nurse.\no Staff will not ridicule, belittle or use sarcasm with a child or\nfamily. Staff will never even jokingly threaten to harm\nchildren or use corporal punishment. Staff should never\ncommunicate on a child’s level when upset or angry.\no Staff will avoid shouting or screaming at a child. Shouting\nover a child is not therapeutic. Staff will never use profane\nor vulgar language with a child. Staff will not utilize “street”\nterminology, only professional or clinical language.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per staff interviews and\ndocumentation, there is insufficient evidence to support the\nallegation that an unknown staff member broke Youth’s A wrist.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n__________________8/20/2025\nBrittany Cowans Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n8/20/2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n12"

    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted into allegations that a youth (Youth A) was sexually assaulted by a staff member (Staff 1) and by another youth (Youth B), and that a staff member broke his wrist. The investigation, relying on interviews and record reviews, found insufficient evidence to support any of the allegations, noting that key records were purged, the accused staff member is deceased, and witness accounts contradicted the youth's claims. While the report concludes no violations were substantiated, the tragic nature of the allegations and the inability to fully corroborate or refute them due to time and record-keeping issues leaves a lingering question about the facility's historical oversight.",
