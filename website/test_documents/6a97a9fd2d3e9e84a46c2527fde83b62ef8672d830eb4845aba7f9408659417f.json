EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the CAP is as follows.\nInterim Inspection 09/27/2021, CAP approved 10/12/2021\nThere are three areas in which the agency is not in compliance with this CAP due to\nrepeat violations documented within this report. The repeat citations and lack of CAP\neffectiveness is partially attributed to a nearly 100% turnover rate in staff and\nsupervisors.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief administrator demonstrated an awareness of the challenges\nwithin the agency as well as struggling with maintaining adherence to the agency’s\nprevious CAP. This in part is due to the high staffing turnover rate. The chief\nadministrator identified the need to retain staff, and train staff to acquire an effective\nCAP to reduce the noncompliance areas. Staff are being hired and trained on a\nconsistent basis in regard to internal procedures that are needed to improve\nlicensing compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency annual budget was observed and reviewed. No concerns were noted.\n6",
    "Staff Interviews\nFour staff were interviewed that included 2 foster care staff that are relatively new to\nthe agency, foster care supervisor, and an independent living specialist. Staff did not\nreport any concerns and indicated that they feel they currently have a stable and\ndedicated team. All reported their supervisor and coworkers were their support\nsystem.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nNo Safety Concerns were noted.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nOne Safety Alert was issued.\nConcern:\nThe following safety concerns were identified during a home visit on 8/25/22.\nThere were no smoke or carbon monoxide detectors in the home.\nThe basement was not observed due to foster parent stating there was a dog in the\nbasement and he didn't feel that it would be safe. The foster parent reported\nsharing an air mattress in the family's living room until finding housing.\nThe safety and physical wellbeing of the foster child wasn't verified due to the child\nnot being home.\nResolution:\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) and foster care Supervisor were sent out to the\nunlicensed relative home due to a safety alert for the child on September 2, 2022.\nFCW and supervisor arrived at the home. FCW observed that there was a family\ngathering happening when they arrived. When walking into the home; there were\npeople sitting in the living area, and in the kitchen area. Foster parent greeted the\nworkers and sat down to discuss concerns in place. Foster youth was seen during\nthe visit and was wearing black legging shorts, and a pink t-shirt. Foster youth had\nher hair in a bun and appeared to be clean and healthy. Workers obtained a picture\nof foster youth for documentation of her wellbeing. Foster youth was very shy to both\nworkers but did say that she liked Olaf from the movie Frozen. Another safety\nconcern that was stated in the safety alert was that there were no smoke or carbon\nmonoxide detectors in the home. This issue was addressed by the workers as they\nprovided three smoke detectors and one carbon monoxide detector to the family.\nFoster Parent went up to the third floor and installed the smoke detector on the third\nfloor, then installed one on the main floor, and went to the basement and installed\none there as well. The carbon monoxide detector was placed on the main floor of the\nhome. Pictures of these smoke detectors/carbon monoxide detector were obtained.\nThe other concern on the safety alert was that the basement was not observed.\nDuring the visit the basement was not observed by FCW and supervisor as the\nfoster parent told them that his dad is the only one who uses the basement and that\n7",
    "the foster child does not go down there. The basement is observed to have a smoke\ndetector in it now. The last safety concern on the safety alert stated that the foster\nparent and the foster youth share an air mattress on the floor in the living area at\nnight. FCW and Supervisor explained to foster parent that this is not a safe sleeping\narrangement and that foster youth needs her own bed/bedroom. Foster parent told\nboth workers that he can buy her a bed for upstairs. Workers did tell foster parent\nthat they can provide a toddler bed for foster youth. The sleeping arrangement\nremains the same, and no pictures were obtained by workers of the sleeping\narrangement due to the gathering at the home. After safety concerns were\ndiscussed. Foster parent voiced his concerns that he does not have housing and\nneeds daycare for the child as he has to work. Workers provided him the information\nneeded for daycare and told him that the agency can assist him in finding a home-\nbut that is something he can do for himself as well. The home was observed to be\nclean and well-kept during the visit-and all safety concerns were addressed with the\ncaregiver. On September 16th, 2022, FCW was sent out to the home for another\nanalysis concerning the Safety Alert. Pictures of the basement, toddler bed and\nmattress and sheets that the agency provided, and a picture of the room that the\nchild will sleep were taken. Upon arriving, FCW told foster parent that the agency\nhad provided him with a toddler bed, sheets and a mattress for them for foster youth.\nFoster parent was very grateful. FCW discussed the plan with foster parent about\nthe plans for foster youths sleeping arrangements, and the permanency of the\ncurrent location that they reside in. Foster parent told FCW that he is planning on\nstaying at the placement he is at now until he finds a new place to rent. After this\nvisit, FCW provided foster parent with a list of apartments in Down River, in his\nbudget that are available to rent. Foster parent then stated that he has a room made\nfor him and foster youth now that is in the upstairs of the home. With this information,\nFCW went up to the room, pictures were taken, and verification of a window was\nmade in the room as well. FCW explained to foster parent that because he has his\nown bed and so does foster youth now, they need to sleep appropriately in their own\nbeds. Foster parent agreed, no signature was needed due to foster youth having a\nbed provided by the agency. The basement was another concern in the home. FCW\nand foster parent went downstairs, and pictures were obtained. The basement\nappeared to be mostly storage; with one bathroom that appeared unused. Foster\nparent explained that no one uses the basement only for storage. Foster youth was\npresent during this visit as well and was wearing a pink t-shirt and black and pink\nshorts. Foster youth’s hair was done in pink barrettes and there were no concerns\nregarding the child. Refer to the safety alert to review pictures.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, we\nrecommend that the agency continue on their regular license.\n8",
