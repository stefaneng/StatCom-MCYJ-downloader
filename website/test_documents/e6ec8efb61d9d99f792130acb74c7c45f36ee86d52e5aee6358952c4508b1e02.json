    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules except\nfor the following:\nR 400.12205 Required staff.\n(8) An agency shall employ or contract for a sufficient number of\ncompetent staff to carry out the provisions covered by these\nrules. The workload for each staff member shall not be more\nthan any of the following:\n(b) Fifteen children assigned to a social services worker for\npurposes of providing direct services in foster care, independent\nliving, adoption, or post adoption services or a combination\nthereof.\nThe caseload information received indicated a foster care worker currently has a\ncaseload of 21. In my interviews with the foster care worker and an adoption\nworker, they both reported carrying a caseload in excess of the workload standard\nestablished by this rule due to staff turnover and difficulty in recruiting replacement\nstaff. I have had communications with administration as they attempt to recruit staff\nand facilitate the possibility of obtaining variances to meet the staffing needs.\nR 400.12212 Personnel records.\n(2) The personnel record shall contain all of the following\ninformation before employment may occur:\n(d) Three references obtained from persons who are unrelated\nto the staff person.\nTwo of the three new staff personnel records submitted did not include\ndocumentation of any references and one of the three records only included 2\nreferences.\nR 400.12212 Personnel records.\n(2) The personnel record shall contain all of the following\ninformation before employment may occur:\n(e) A record of any convictions other than minor traffic\nviolations from either of the following:\n(i) The Michigan state police or the equivalent state or\nCanadian provincial law enforcement agency where the person\nusually resides.\n3",
    "One of the three new staff personnel records submitted did not include\ndocumentation that a criminal records clearance (ICHAT) had been completed as\nrequired by this rule.\nR 400.12212 Personnel records.\n(2) The personnel record shall contain all of the following\ninformation before employment may occur:\n(h) Documentation from the department that the person has\nnot been named in a central registry case as the perpetrator of\nchild abuse or neglect in Michigan or in any state where the\nperson lived in the 5 years preceding hire.\nOne of the three new staff personnel records submitted did not include\ndocumentation that a central registry clearance had been completed as required by\nthis rule. This was the same record that did not include a criminal record clearance.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the reevaluation.\nThe placement specifications shall include all of the following:\n(a) Age,\n(b) Gender,\n(c) Race,\n(d) Number of children preferred by the family,\n(e) Characteristics of children best served by the home,\n(f) Children who may not be placed in the home. The child's\nracial, ethnic, and cultural identity, heritage, and background\nmay only be considered if an assessment of the individual child\nindicates that such consideration is in the best interests of the\nchild.\nOne of the three current foster home files reviewed contained a reevaluation report\ndated 11/01/2021 that did not document the placement specifications as required by\nthis rule. The report contained a generic statement to “continue with no change”\ninstead of indicating the characteristics as required. The entire rule is cited because\nthe general statement did not identify any of the characteristics required.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of the\nfollowing information:\n(d) Dates and places of contacts, names of persons\ninterviewed, and names of the interviewers. If children are\ninterviewed, their last names shall not be included in the report.\n4",
    "Two of the three special evaluations reviewed contained reports that included the\nlast name of a child placed in the home that was interviewed as a part of the\nevaluation.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(a) Provide the foster parent with a copy of the report\nrequired by subrule (5) of this rule within 10 calendar days of its\ncompletion.\nTwo of the three special evaluations reviewed did not include documentation to\nindicate the foster parent was provided a copy of the report as required by this rule.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(b) Inform the foster parent, in writing, that he or she has a\nright to have his or her written response included as an\nattachment to the report required by subrule (5) of this rule.\nTwo of the three special evaluations reviewed did not include documentation to\nindicate the foster parent was informed in writing they could have a written response\nincluded as an attachment to the report as required by this rule.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(c) Provide a copy of the report to any social services worker\nthat has children placed in the home.\nTwo of the three special evaluations reviewed did not include documentation to\nindicate the social service worker with children placed in the home was provided a\ncopy of the report as required by this rule.\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(4) If an emergency change in placement is necessary, then all\nof the documentation required in subrules (2) and (3) of this rule\nshall be in the child's record within 14 calendar days after the\nchange in placement.\nTwo of the three foster child records reviewed indicated the foster child had a\nchange in placement and the documentation of the change as required by this rule\nwas not located. In the first example the youth had a change in placement on\n05/02/21 and on 06/21/21 and the required documentation for each of these\nchanges could not be located. The second youth had a change in placement\n07/18/21 and the documentation for this change could not be located at the time of\nthis review.\n5",
    "R 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(5) If an agency is no longer providing services to the child in a\nfoster home, then both of the following shall be documented\nbefore a change in placement:\n(a) A summary of the services provided during care up\nto the time of the change in placement and the needs\nthat remain to be met.\n(b) Provision for any continuing services.\nOne of the records for three youth who were discharged from a foster home did not\nhave the change in placement documentation completed that included all of the\ninformation required by this rule. The documentation did not include a summary of\nthe services provided or the provision for any continuing services.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each\nchild and parent or parents, as follows:\n(b) Within 120 calendar days after the initial removal and\nat least once every 90 calendar days thereafter.\nOne of the three current foster child records reviewed had an updated service plan\nthat was not completed within the timeline established by this rule. In this example\nthe report for the time period ending 12/13/2021 had not yet been completed at the\ntime of this review. It was indicated that the report was only “in progress”.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED 12/02/2020 Renewal, CAP Approved\n12/17/2020\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(1) An agency’s medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(c) A physical examination for each child as follows,\nunless a greater frequency is medically indicated:\n(iii) A physical examination every 14 months.\n(f) The provision of a dental examination and any\ntreatment required for each child who is 4 years of age\nand older, including both of the following:\n(i) A dental examination within 12 months before\nplacement or a new dental examination shall be\ncompleted not more than 90 calendar days after\nplacement.\nOne of the three current foster child records reviewed indicated the youth had not\nreceived an initial physical exam as required by this rule. In this example the youth\n6",
    "had a documented physical dated 03/12/2020 with an updated physical exam due\nto be completed by 05/12/2021. There was no documentation the updated physical\nexam had been completed at the time of this review.\nOne of the three current foster child records reviewed documented an initial dental\nexam had been completed within the time frame established by this rule. In this\nexample an initial dental exam was due by 08/25/2021 and there was no\ndocumentation the initial dental had been completed at the time of this review.\nThere was also no documentation a dental exam had been completed within 12\nmonths prior to placement.\nR 400.12607 Agency recommendation.\n(4) An agency shall provide the applicants for adoption with a\nsigned and dated copy of the evaluation and recommendation\nupon its completion.\nTwo of the four applicants for adoption files who had recommendations for denial\ndid not have documentation the applicants were given a copy of the evaluation and\nrecommendation upon its completion. Documentation that a 605 form was sent to\nthe applicants was used to determine compliance/noncompliance. Two of the four\nfiles did not document this form was sent to the applicants.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the\nfollowing:\nISEP 4.22 MiSACWIS (Commitment 22). DHHS will maintain an\noperational statewide automated child welfare information\nsystem (“MiSACWIS”) which will be the primary tracking\nsystem and satisfy federal reporting requirements.\nThe MISACWIS information reviewed as a part of this interim evaluation indicated\nthere was some missing information not uploaded into the information system as\nrequired. Some examples of the missing information were PATPs with signatures,\none youth picture, one adoption closing summary, two adoption closing summaries\nthat did not include signatures, and one special evaluation report.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\n7",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas\nThe need to have documents signed within 30 days of the document’s completion.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan for a special evaluation\ncompleted 10/25/2021. Noncompliance with 421(b) was determined and the\ncorrective action plan was approved 12/15/2021. The renewal evaluation completed\n12/02/2020 determined noncompliance with 212(3)(a), 418(2)(b), 413(1)(c)(ii),(f)(ii),\nISEP 6.33, ISEP4.49, FOM 722 -08 C, -06H, 06B, -15. The corrective action plan\nfor the renewal evaluation was approved 12/17/2020. A repeat noncompliance with\n418(2)(b) was identified as a part of this interim evaluation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment primarily consisted of a review in the progress of\nthe agency to implement the corrective action plan associated with the renewal\nevaluation completed in December 2020. The assessment indicated progress had been\nmade but was limited due to two primary challenges. One challenge was associated\nwith COVID related circumstances and the second challenge associated with the\nagency to maintain sufficient staffing numbers.\nInterviews\nChild welfare staff was involved in the entrance conference. Foster Care and\nAdoption/Certification staff were interviewed by telephone with the only concerns noted\nbeing caseload size associated with the difficulty related to staff recruitment.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: Recommended a relative home attach safety features to doors exiting\nthe home.\n8",
