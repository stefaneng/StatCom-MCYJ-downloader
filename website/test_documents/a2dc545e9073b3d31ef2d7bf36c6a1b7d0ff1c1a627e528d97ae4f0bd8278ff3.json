TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR. 400.4113 Employee Records\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing training\nThe facility is advised when rehiring employees who have been away for over 6 months,\nthe employee should be considered a new hire and all clearances, pre-hire paperwork,\nand staff orientation and training must be redone.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe following discussions occurred with recommendations made to the Chief\nAdministrator:\n1) The agency’s plan to merge Calumet Center youth with Lincoln Center youth at\nthe Lincoln Center location in August 2022.\n2) I recommended the need for incident reports to identify what de-escalation\ntechniques were used by staff prior to a restraint, the name of the restraint and\nprotective technique(s) used and the debriefing that occurred after a restraint. I\nrecommended adding prompts to staff written statements to generate more\ninformation about what led to the event and how staff responded.\n3) I advised the facility that the supervisor who does not qualify must be demoted\nimmediately.\n4) I provided clarification regarding policy revisions that may be needed related to\nthe rule addendum effective 5/30/22, and the difference between the addendum\nand the new rules that are still pending.\nThe following discussions occurred with recommendations made to the Clinical Director:\n6",
    "5) I recommended wording changes to the youth face sheet so that the questions\nalign with licensing rule requirements of R 400.4152 Initial Documentation.\n6) Ideas were exchanged related to possible corrective action for missing service\nplans in the detention program.\n7) I recommended that revised policies include the date of the revision on the\npolicy.\nThe following recommendation was made to the Center Director:\n8) I recommended supervisors be reminded to leave no blank spaces on the form\nwhen completing youth face sheets.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nCalumet Center is a secure juvenile detention and treatment facility that accepts youths\nreferred by the Care Management Organization (CMO), MDHHS Juvenile Division and\nvarious Courts. Their capacity is 88 and current census is 26. The staff to resident ratio\nis 1:5. Since the last licensing period, there has been a significant reduction in restraints\nfrom 72 to 24, and seclusions from 37 to 14.\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care or child abuse\nand/or neglect during this licensing period.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nSIR 2022C0207019 intake 1/31/22; CAP appr 4/18/22 involved a supervisor punching at\na youth during an altercation. It was unclear if the punch connected with the youth but a\nwritten statement from the youth indicated it did. The corrective action plan included\nterminating the supervisor and retraining staff on crisis intervention procedures with an\nemphasis on prohibiting the use of corporal punishment.\nSIR 2022C0108014 intake 2/17/22; CAP appr 3/17/2022 involved a staff person\nthrowing two punches toward an 18-year-old youth’s face and chest. Once the staff and\nyouth were separated, the staff reapproached the youth twice more, swinging at him a\nthird time and provoking the youth with his presence. The corrective action plan\nincluded terminating the staff and retraining remaining staff on crisis intervention\nprocedures with an emphasis on prohibiting the use of corporal punishment.\nThe facility has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans unrelated to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nSIR 2022C0207017 intake 1/21/22; CAP appr 4/26/22 involved inaccurate information\nand untimely submission of a restraint report. The corrective action plan included\n7",
    "facility managers being retrained on incident report writing with an emphasis on timely\nand accurate reporting.\nSIR 2022C0207023 intake 3/10/22; CAP appr 5/31/22 involved a staff person delaying\ncalling for assistance and failing to separate two youth who were fighting. The staff\nperson was suspended for three days for not providing continuous line of sight and\nuntimely response to the fight. The staff was supervised daily for a month. Staff and\nsupervisors were retrained on calling for and responding to calls for assistance.\nRECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility continue on their regular license.\nJuly 22, 2022\n________________________________________\nDate\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 25, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n8"
