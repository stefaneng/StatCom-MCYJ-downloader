    "cheeking of medication. Therapist 1 reported she had discussed cheeking of medication\nin therapy sessions. Therapist 1 reported Youth A refused to see the psychiatrist as\nwell.\nI reviewed the Progress Note completed by Psychiatrist 1. Psychiatrist 1 had a\nscheduled meeting with Youth A on 6/10/21.

Some of the incident reports\nand MARS codes did not align with the dates of medication refusals.\n4",
    "I reviewed nine Incident reports pertaining to AWOLS completed by Youth A. Staff were\nsupervising each time Youth A ran.\nI interviewed Administrator 3. Administrator 3 reported staff were all aware of Youth A’s\ntriggers for running and her behaviors that occurred before running. Administrator 3\nreported staff would position themselves by the exit doors and follow afterwards if able.\nAdministrator 3 reported the staff are aware of certain areas surrounding campus youth\nwould AWOL and they would check out these areas for Youth A.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: The agency had enough staff supervising Youth A and were\naware of the AWOLS each time that she did AWOL. The agency\nis an open program. All nine AWOLS showed the staff were\nsupervising and did react in a manner appropriate for the\nAWOL.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\n(c) Documentation of medical care and maintenance of\nhealth records.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS:  Youth A was provided opportunities to attend therapy and\nbehavioral health assessments from a Psychiatrist. Youth\nA was also prescribed medication for diagnosis. Youth A\nrefused her 6/10/21 behavioral health care. Medications\nwere discontinued at that time by the Psychiatrist\nproviding care to Youth A.\n MARS sheets identify an area of concern pertaining to\ndocumentation. Documentation is not consistent with the\ndirections on the forms. Blank boxes are left without\ndictation and code “N’s” are not described in a comment.\n Youth A refused Hydroxyzine ER 2 out of 70 days based\non the MARS.\n Youth A refused Intuniv ER 20 out of 70 days.\nRoutine medical services were provided to Youth A. Youth A did\nnot always utilize these services. Documentation of medical\ncare was not completed consistently. There were many blanks\nleft on the MARS leaving questions as to what happened to the\nmedications. According to the MARS Youth A refused\nHydroxyzine 2 out of 70 days. Youth A did refuse Intuniv ER 20\nout of 70 days.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS: The agency received information that Youth A\nwas allegedly raped by a male youth from the facility when they AWOLed\ntogether and did not report this to Centralized intake or police.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviewed Youth A face to face at the facility on 6/22/21. Youth A reported a man\nhad inappropriately sexually touched her when she had gone AWOL. Youth A\nreported she told this to Therapist 1.\nI interviewed Therapist 1 via phone on 7/22/21. Therapist 1 reported Youth A stated\nthe male peer she AWOLed with around April 23, 202, forced her to have sex with\nhim. Therapist 1 reported Youth A initially stated they had consensual sex when she\nreturned from AWOLing but then recanted and stated it was not consensual.\nTherapist 1 reported she had not reported that to Centralize Intake. Therapist 1\nreported she thought it was the DHHS Workers responsibility to do this. Therapist 1\nreported she did not call the police to report a potential crime and was not aware if\nanyone had. Therapist 1 reported she was unaware if this allegation was called into\nCentralized Intake, after she received the information. Therapist 1 does not recall\nanyone coming to investigate the matter.\n6",
    "Case Note Report dated 4/29/21 documented Youth A’s conversation with the\nTherapist concerning the AWOL and consensual sex with the male peer.\nI interviewed Administrator 2, Clinical Service Manager. Administrator 1 reported it\nwas her understanding that the DHHS Worker told Therapist 1 the allegations;\ntherefore, they did not think that they were responsible to call it in. Administrator 2\nwas not aware if the allegations were called in.\nEmails were reviewed from the DHHS Worker and agency on 5/24/21 with the\nexpectations that the DHHS worker would call the allegations into centralized intake.\nAgency Mandated reporting policy was reviewed:\n…When an Eagle Village employee has suspected that a youth or someone\nassociated with a youth has been physically or sexually abused or neglected, that\nemployee is to notify his/her supervisor immediately. In most cases this will be the\nyouth’s Family Therapist…Upon notification, the Therapist in charge of the case\nshall: (2) Immediately notify the DHHS Child Protection Services-Centralized Intake\nDivision…\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4131 Compliance with child protection law; development of plan\nrequired.\nThe licensee shall develop and implement a written plan to\nassure\ncompliance with the child protection law, 1975 PA 238, MCL\n722.621 to 722.638\nANAYLSIS Therapist 1 and Administrator 2 were provided information\nconcerning an alleged sexually assault towards Youth A. neither\nemployee contacted the DHHS Child Protective Services\nCentralized Intake Division.\nThe agency policy denotes the “Therapist in charge of the case”\nis to notify DHHS Child Protective Services Centralized Intake.\nThe therapist did not follow the facility policy of reporting the\ninformation to centralized intake.\nAdditionally, Act 238, Sec 722.623 (1) (a) and (2) designates the\nindividual suspecting abuse and neglect to report the\ninformation to Centralized Intake and then providing this\ninformation to their superiors in the agency. This is not included\nin the facility’s current policy. The policy must be revised to\nreflect Act 238 Sec 722.623(1) (a) and (2).\nCONCLUSION VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
