    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4131 Compliance with child protection law;\nSection development of plan required.\nDescription (1) The licensee shall develop and implement a written plan to\nassure compliance with the child protection law, 1975 PA 238,\nMCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Chief Administrator did not report suspected child abuse/ neglect\nto the appropriate government agency within 24 hours.\nInvestigation I was assigned this investigation on 6/12/23.\nI contacted Complainant via phone. He does not work at the\nfacility but said Staff 4 informed him that one staff at the facility\ntwisted a child’s ear and another staff left bruises on a second\nchild on 5/27/23. Complainant said Chief Administrator (CA) was\naware of the incidents but did not report them, so he reported\nthem to the appropriate government agency on 5/30/23.\nAccording to MISACWIS, CA did report one of the two incidents\non 5/31/23. Consultant 2 and Government Worker 1 were\nassigned to investigate those allegations.\nOn 6/12/23, I arrived at the facility unannounced and interviewed\nStaff 1, 2 and 3 separately. All said they were trained on and\nunderstood the Child Protection Law. None had ever suspected\nabuse at the facility.\nI reviewed the agency’s Child Protection Law policy. The policy is\nconsistent with the law and instructs staff to report all suspected\nabuse/neglect directly to the government agency.\nI collaborated with Consultant 2. She had already determined in\nSIR 2023C0000500 that multiple staff witnessed potentially\nabusive events and failed to report them to the government\nagency within 24 hours. SIR 2023C0000500 cited the agency for\nfailure to comply with the Child Protection Law.\nAnalysis Failure to report suspected child abuse was investigated by\nConsultant 2 and cited in SIR 2023C0000500. It was determined\nmultiple staff witnessed potentially abusive events and failed to\nreport them to the appropriate government agency within 24\nhours. The agency was cited for R 400.4131 Child Protection\n2",
    "Law. Therefore, the agency is not being cited again for the same\nincidents.\nCONSULTATION\nI observed the phone list and contact number for MDHHS\nCentralized Intake posted in the staff office. I suggested CA label\nthe number “Children’s Protective Services” since staff may not\nknow it by the name of MDHHS Centralized Intake.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED (cited in 2023C0000500)\nRule Code & Rule 400.4116 Chief administrator; responsibilities.\nSection (1) An agency shall assign the chief administrator responsibility for\nDescription the onsite day-to-day operation of the institution and for ensuring\ncompliance with these rules.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Chief Administrator did not discipline, terminate, or place staff on\nadministrative leave under investigation for suspected\nabuse/neglect.\nInvestigation It was Complainant’s opinion that CA took too much time to\naddress the staff with pending abuse allegations. He stated, “The\nemployees didn’t get disciplined or terminated until I called the\ngovernment agency. CA should have moved quicker. She took\nfour days. As of now, I’m still not sure if they (staff) were\n(disciplined/terminated) or not. They (staff) shouldn’t just be on\nrestrictions.”\nI coordinated with Consultant 2 and Government Worker 1\nregarding the safety/separation plans implemented for the three\nstaff under investigation. For incidents on 5/27/23 Consultant 2\nindicated Former Staff 1 continued to work until she resigned on\n5/31/23 and Manager of Compliance (non-regulated position) told\nher the other two staff were working on the unit, but they would\nnot be alone with children or restrain any child. On 6/6/23,\nConsultant 2 met with Manager of Compliance and Director of\nOperations (another non-regulated position) and strongly\nrecommended the remaining two staff be placed on administrative\nleave pending the outcome of the investigation. Finally, on 6/8/23\nthe facility placed Staff 6 on administrative leave, but Former Staff\n2 continued to work until she resigned on her own on 6/14/23.\n3",
    "Analysis Licensing rules do not prohibit staff under investigation from\nworking. However, for the protection of both parties, it is general\npractice at child caring institutions to separate the staff from the\nalleged child victims pending the outcome of the investigation.\nThe initial safety/separation plans implemented were unrealistic,\nunsafe and not timely. It is unsafe and unfair to coworkers to\nallow certain staff to work with children while they are not allowed\nto restrain in emergencies. It is unrealistic to have staff persons\nworking on a unit with structural blind spots and commit that they\nwill not be alone with a child. Thirdly, safety/separation plans\nwere not done timely. They were implemented days and weeks\nafter the incidents and developed by individuals in unregulated\npositions who do not work in the facility or directly with the staff or\nchildren involved.\nCA is responsible for the day-to-day operations at the facility. She\ndid not develop sufficient or timely safety/separation plans for\nFormer Staff 1 & 2 or Staff 6. The staff continued to work with the\nidentified child victims while they were being investigated for\nalleged abuse. Those investigations were completed on 6/22/23.\nWhile the identified staff persons were not substantiated by the\ngovernment agency for child abuse, all three were placed on the\n“confirmed” list, meaning they were deemed unsafe to work with\nchildren.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation/ Chief Administrator does not respond to important\nAdditional communications from staff.\nFindings\nInvestigation Complainant said CA did not answer an important call from Staff 4\nand did not return the call.\n4",
    "I left voice message for Staff 4 on 6/14/23 and 6/22/23. As of\n6/26/23, I have been unable to connect with her.\nI asked CA who the staff can contact for direction afterhours and\non weekends and holidays. She said if she is unavailable, they\ncan call Director of Operations (non-regulated position) or\nLicensee Designee. For medical concerns, staff can contact\nNurse who is available 24/7.\nI reviewed the agency’s Access to Administrator policy. It\nindicates the Licensee Designee (LD) is available and reachable\nvia cell phone 24/7 to all employees and any governing body. The\ncell numbers of CA and LD were posted in the staff office.\nADDITIONAL FINDING\nThroughout the course of this investigation, I learned that CA is\nfrequently expected to perform the duties of three regulated\npositions. She works as chief administrator, direct care staff and\nsupervisor of direct care staff simultaneously which is not doable.\nCA said a direct care staff was recently promoted to Team Leader.\nI checked his resume and transcripts, and Team Leader does\nqualify as a Supervisor of Direct Care Staff.\nDirect Care Staff 1, 2, and 3 said they were aware of Team\nLeader. However, they did not recognize him as a supervisor but\ninstead, referred to CA as their direct supervisor.\nI interviewed CA at the facility on 6/12/23. Due to short staffing,\nshe said she is working as the CA, the supervisor and direct care\nstaff. I asked how many supervisors work at the facility. CA said\nTeam Leader works afternoon shift on weekdays and 14 hours a\nday every other weekend. CA works as the Supervisor on\nweekdays and there is no midnight shift supervisor.\nI asked about the Social Service Worker at the facility. CA said\nSocial Service Worker comes to the facility once a week for team\nmeetings.\nI asked about the Social Service Supervisor. CA said Social\nService Supervisor’s office is located off-site and that she never\ncomes to the facility.\nI asked who decides whether to admit new children and if those\nchildren are appropriate for admission. CA said the Licensee\nDesignee who works off-site decides which children to admit and\n5",
    "how many, based on staffing. I asked if the facility has ever been\nfully staffed with administrative, supervisory, social service, and\ndirect care staff. She said since they opened in 2022. there was\nnever a time when she has not had to perform multiple roles.\nI attempted to interview Team Leader via phone on 6/14/23. As of\n6/26/23, Team Leader did not return my call.\nOn 6/22/23 I emailed Licensee Designee requesting the facility’s\norganizational chart. It showed individuals in positions of Licensee\nDesignee, Chief Administrator and 13 Direct Care Staff. One of\nthose staff was placed on the “confirmed” list on 6/22/23 and\nanother is on leave pending the outcome of investigation SIR\n2023C0000559, leaving 11 Direct Care Staff to cover three shifts.\nThere were no Supervisors of Direct Care Staff listed on the chart\nand no empty Supervisor vacancies. I brought it to the attention of\nLicensee Designee via email that there are no supervisors and\nthat individuals covering as Supervisors do not count as direct\ncare staff in the 2:1 ratio unless the supervisor is specified as and\nonly working that shift as direct care staff.\nAnalysis Regarding the allegation that the CA does not respond to\nimportant calls, the agency is found in compliance as there are\nemergency numbers available to staff outside of regular business\nhours.\nThe agency does not have a sufficient number of supervisory or\ndirect care staff to perform the prescribed functions required by\nlicensing rules.\nOn weekdays, CA works two or three different regulated positions\nsimultaneously and is the primary person on-call on afternoons,\nnights, weekends, and holidays. This is unacceptable and\nunsustainable.\nThere is one afternoon shift Team Leader/Supervisor who was\nrecently assumed the position. Team Leader is also one of the\nstaff identified by Consultant 2 as failing to report suspected\nabuse in SIR 2023C0000500. It is likely the facility routinely\ncounts Team Leader/Supervisor in the staffing ratio.\nPrior to Team Leader’s promotion, CA said she was the only\nSupervisor at the facility. She also covers for Direct Care Staff\nwhen staffing is short. Currently the facility does not have a\nsufficient number of supervisors to run a 24/7 operation or a\n6",
    "sufficient number of direct care staff to consistently run a ratio of 1\nstaff for every 2 children.\nConclusion REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0446027 intake 5/12/22; CAP approved 7/22/22\n2023C0000500; intake 5/31/23; CAP pending\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\nSection (1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-to-child\nDescription ratio formula for direct care workers. If a child caring institution is\ncontracted by the department to care for youth, the facility will\nfollow its contracted ratio.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAdditional Chief Administrator indicated the facility has a staff-to-resident\nFindings: ratio of 1:2. On 6/12/23, while I was at the facility, Chief\nAdministrator was working as direct care staff and left two staff on\nthe unit with six youth.\nInvestigation According to CA, the facility’s policy indicates a ratio of 1:2 staff to\nyouth is maintained during waking hours. CA did not know if the\nratio was set by the MDHHS contractor or if the agency set it on\ntheir own.\nOn 6/12/23, CA said there were six youth on the unit being\nmonitored by herself and two direct care staff. CA sat with me in\nthe conference room for approximately an hour leaving the unit\nout of ratio. While working as direct care staff, CA admitted she\nsometimes leaves the unit to do administrative and supervisory\ntasks but counts herself in the ratio.\nI interviewed Staff 5 on 6/23/23 via phone. She works midnight\nshifts from 10pm – 9am. Staff 5 expressed concerns about the\nfacility being short-staffed, particularly in the mornings between\n7:30am – 9am when the children are waking up. She admitted\n“We try to convince the kids to stay in their rooms since there’s\nonly two of us (on midnight shift monitoring six children) until 9am\nwhen first shift comes in.”\nI reviewed the agency’s policy/program statement identifying their\nratio of youth to staff as 2:1 during waking hours. It does not\nidentify the staffing ratio during sleeping hours or what hours the\nfacility considers as “waking” and “sleeping.”\n7",
    "Analysis While tending to her administrative and supervisory duties, CA left\nthe residential unit out of ratio on 6/12/23. With intersecting/\noverlapping roles, it is impossible for regulators to determine the\nfacility's daily compliance with their identified staffing ratio.\nAccording to Staff 5, children are expected to stay in their rooms\nuntil the dayshift staff arrive at 9am in order to meet the 2:1\nstaffing pattern. This seems punitive to the children and led to an\naltercation between staff and a child in SIR 2023C0000544. Also\nwithout designated waking and sleeping hours, it is impossible for\nregulators to determine the facility’s daily compliance with their\nstated ratio.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommended amount of\nsleep for ages 6 – 12 is 9 to 12 hours and for ages 13 – 17 is 8 to\n10 hours. The facility must designate “normal sleeping hours” as\nrequired in the rules and staff per their day time ratio during\nwaking hours.\nCONSULTATION\nAdrian Group Home accepts male and females ages 6 – 17 and\nhas one living space for ten youth. This age range may be too\nbroad for one living space. For supervision and programming\npurposes, I recommended the age range be narrowed to a five- or\nsix-year span.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & Rule 400.4130 Privacy and confidentiality.\nSection (1) An institution shall assure resident and parent privacy and\nDescription confidentiality and shall protect residents from exploitation.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAdditional Staff 4 shared youth names with Complainant which violates\nFinding confidentiality.\nInvestigation When Complainant who does not work at the facility reported to\nthe government agency, he identified the first and last names of\nthe children who were allegedly abused by staff. Complainant\nsaid he received the information from Staff 4.\n8",
    "Analysis Staff 4 violated confidentiality by sharing the children’s identifying\ndata with Complainant.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and a corrective action plan is required. Per the\nrecommendation in special investigation 2023C0000500, a First Provisional license\nis recommended.\nJune 28, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 6, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n9"
