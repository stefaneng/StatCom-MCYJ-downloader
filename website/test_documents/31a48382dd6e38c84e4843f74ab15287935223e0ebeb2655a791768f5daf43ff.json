These investigations were reviewed, and no concerns were noted.\nThe agency has submitted no acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe staff members interviewed reported that there have been significant changes to\nthe program over the past year and this, combined with a lack of staff turnover,\ncontributed to an increased ability to maintain compliance with rules and policy. This\nwas evidenced by the significant reduction in violations present in the files I\nreviewed.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MSA requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nHolly K.
