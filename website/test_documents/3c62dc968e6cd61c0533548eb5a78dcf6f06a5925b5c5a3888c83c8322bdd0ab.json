    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection\nDescription (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iii)Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or otherwise\nsuggesting physical or emotional harm to a youth.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Two different staff threatened to slap Youth I.\nInvestigation I exchanged emails with Complainant. He received the\ninformation from Youth I while he was interviewing her on 5/31/23\nand expressed no additional concerns about the facility.\nI notified Rights Officer of the allegations.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing rule violations.\nI notified Foster Care worker that I was assigned this investigation.\nShe expressed no additional concerns about staff at the facility.\nI interviewed Rights Officer on 6/1/2023. On 5/24/23 he said he\naddressed Youth I’s verbal grievance alleging Team Leader and\nStaff 1 threatened to slap her and found no evidence that it\noccurred. Rights Officer said he interviewed both staff on 5/25/23,\nboth of them denied the allegations and there were no other\nknown witnesses.\nI interviewed Youth I on 6/6/23 with Quality Manager present. She\nhas been at the facility for approximately one month. A few weeks\nago on B wing, she said Team Leader told her she’d slap her face\nbecause she was behaving badly and had not gone to school.\nYouth I said no one else heard Team Leader threaten her.\nAnother day on B wing, Youth I said she was argumentative and\ndisrespectful toward Staff 1. “Staff 1 got an attitude and said, ‘I’ll\nbeat you and slap you.’” And no one witnessed this interaction.\nShortly after Youth I was moved to another wing – B wing.\nI interviewed Team Leader with Quality Manager present. She\nhas worked at the facility for over six years. Team Leader works\n2",
    "on B wing and passes medication to all youths in the building. A\nwhile back, she said Youth I was negatively influencing other\nyouths on B wing. Shortly after that, the youth was moved to\nanother wing. Team Leader denied ever threatening Youth I.\nI interviewed Staff 1 with Quality Manager present. She has\nworked at the facility on B wing for five months. Staff 1 recalled\nthe incident that occurred a few weeks ago on B wing. She said\nshe was monitoring a youth on 1:1 and Youth I was provoking the\nyouth she was supervising. “I asked Youth I to move away.\nTeam Leader also asked her to move. Youth I was defiant and\nwould not stop provoking her peer. I did not threaten to slap her\nbut her peer, Youth C, did…Youth I was moved (to A wing) that\nsame day.”\nI interviewed Unit Manager with Quality Manager present. I asked\nwhy Youth I was moved from B wing to A wing. She said youths\nare moved to different wings for various reasons. She could not\nrecall the exact reason Youth I was moved from B to A wing,\nhowever, she said it was not due to the allegations made against\nTeam Leader or Staff 1.\nI interviewed Youth C with Quality Manager present. She has\nbeen at the facility for five months. Youth C recalled the incident\nclearly. “Youth I was not following directions and refused school.\nShe was in the (general) area. Staff 1 approached Youth I and\nYouth I argued with her. Staff 1 never said she would smack\nYouth I. It was me. I looked in Youth I’s face and told her I was\ngoing to smack her.”\nNeither Team Leader nor Staff 1 have any disciplinary write-ups in\ntheir employee files.\nAnalysis Team Leader, Staff 1 and Youth C denied that Team Leader\nand/or Staff 1 threatened to slap Youth I. Rather, upon interview,\nYouth C admitted that she was the one who threatened to “smack”\nYouth I.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJune 7, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 7, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
