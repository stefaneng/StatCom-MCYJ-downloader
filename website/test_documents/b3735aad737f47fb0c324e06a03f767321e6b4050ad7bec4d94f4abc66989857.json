    "PREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted they need to improve the process of central registry\nclearances since they had a repeat violation for Rule 113(1)(i) on this audit. They\nare looking into developing further tools, processes, and meetings with human\nresources to determine the barriers and solutions. Chief Administrator reported\nthings are going well at the facility and they have a good team. They had a difficult\nyouth from November-December 2024, which caused a lot of stress on staff, as\nwell as youth at the facility. CA reported he is still working through and addressing\nthe barriers and requirements the new MDHHS contract has had on their facility.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported they enjoy working at the facility. They recently had a difficult youth,\nand staff navigated the situation well, with resilience and patience, which was\nawesome to see. They have a great team, and even with a lot of new staff,\neveryone shows they want to be there. They feel supported by their peers,\nsupervisors and upper management. Supervisors and upper management always\nmake themselves available and are open to feedback. The collaboration they've\nhad with other units, such as nursing, has been amazing and they feel supported in\nthat regard as well.\nYouth reported they like it at the facility. Staff are nice and provide support. They\nlike having the ability to choose and cook meals with staff support. They like having\ntheir own space, and like that it feels more like a home than a facility.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on January 15, 2025, and there were no\nconcerns noted.\n4",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules.
