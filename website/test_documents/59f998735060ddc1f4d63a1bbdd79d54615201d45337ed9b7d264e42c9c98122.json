Staff would only use one person for\nrestraints. The male staff would rub up against the female youth\nfrom behind during a restraint. A supervisor was told of the\nconcerns and never responded.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nFormer Foster Care Supervisor (FFCS) was interviewed via\nphone on 5/8/25. FFCS reported Youth A was a youth on her\nfoster care caseload in the past when FFCS was a foster care\nworker and a foster care supervisor. However, FFCS reported she\nnever managed Youth A’s case when Youth A was placed at the\nfacility. FFCS reported she supports Youth A emotionally and\nfinancially now that Youth A is an adult and no longer has an open\nfoster care case. FFCS reported Youth A’s cousin’s foster care\ncase remains open and was flagged when complaints came in\nabout the facility, so FFCS was asked to reach out to Youth A and\nask her about her time at the facility from 2018-2019. FFCS\nreported when she reached out to Youth A, Youth A provided her\nwith the allegations.\nYouth A was interviewed via phone on 5/8/25. Youth A reported\nshe was placed at the facility, in Beata Hall, from 2018-2019.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 was really rude and physical with her and\n2",
    "other youth. Youth A reported Staff 1 did a restraint on her on the\nday she arrived at the facility because she was refusing to get out\nof Foster Care Worker’s (FCW) car since she didn’t want to be at\nthe facility. Youth A reported Staff 1 restrained her from behind\nand it was like he wanted her to feel his private parts when he was\nrestraining her. Youth A reported Staff 1 did this type of restraint to\nall the female youth at the facility. Youth A reported Staff 1 also\nrestrained youth in a more angry and aggressive way. Youth A\nreported the more she showed frustration, the angrier Staff 1\nwould become. Youth A reported restraints are always supposed\nto be done by two staff and if they’re restraining a female youth,\nit’s always supposed to be a male and a female staff. Youth A\nreported every time Staff 1 worked, he was verbally aggressive\nand never gave the youth choices. Youth A reported Staff 1 made\nfrequent sexual comments towards female youth and would touch\nfemale youth in a sexual way (such as standing behind them\nduring a restraint).\nYouth A reported the facility would require new youth to shower\nwith the shower curtains open and a staff watching them for the\nfirst 30 days after admission. Youth A reported there should have\nnever been male staff in the bathroom with female youth, but male\nstaff would also watch new youth in the showers with the shower\ncurtain open.\nYouth A reported Supervisor 2 wasn’t a regular employee in Beata\nHall, but he would report if there was an emergency. Youth A\nreported Supervisor 2 would frequently be present at Henry Ford\nSchool. One time, Supervisor 2 took Youth A and Youth B to the\nbathroom, and he stood at the door to the bathroom listening to\nthem go to the bathroom. Youth A reported Supervisor 2 didn’t sit\nin a chair outside the bathroom but would stand in the bathroom\nso he could hear them.\nYouth A reported she told FCW, Supervisor 1 and Therapist all\nthese concerns during the time she was placed at the facility.\nYouth A reported Therapist would help her as much as she could\nand Therapist would pass the concerns along to Supervisor 1, but\nnothing was ever taken care of. Youth A reported Supervisor 1\nnever addressed any of her concerns. Youth A reported she\ncompleted written grievances about all these situations, so there\nshould be a record of her concerns. Youth A reported Therapist,\nStaff 3, and Staff 4 would have knowledge of these issues and\nincidents.\n3",
    "Youth B was interviewed via phone on 5/8/25. Youth B reported\nshe was placed at the facility on and off from age 8 to age 17, so\nshe spent a lot of time there. Youth B reported she was placed at\nthe facility from 2018-2019 in Beata Hall and remembered Youth\nA. Youth B reported she remembered Staff 1 because he was\nsomeone she looked up to because he reminded her of a father-\nfigure a little bit. Youth B reported she never heard or saw Staff 1\nsay or do anything inappropriate to her or any of the other female\nyouth at the facility. Youth B reported Staff 1 would have\n“wandering eyes” sometimes, but she thinks it’s because he was a\nlittle cross-eyed, so he couldn’t help it. Youth B reported the only\nsituation she ever heard about (but didn’t see) was maybe Staff 1\nput too much of his weight on a female youth (couldn’t remember\nwho) during a restraint, but Youth B couldn’t remember the\nsituation or circumstances.\nYouth B reported she was never restrained while at the facility.\nYouth B reported staff were not allowed to do one-person\nrestraints, and she never saw any staff do one-person restraints.\nYouth B reported she sometimes saw staff do one-person escorts\nwhere they would hold a youths’ arm to go from one place to\nanother, but it wasn’t a restraint. Youth B reported she never saw\nStaff 1 complete one-person restraints by standing behind a\nfemale youth and holding them or rubbing his private parts against\nthem. Youth B reported one time she saw a female youth (couldn’t\nremember who) being restrained by Staff 10 and Staff 10 had the\nfemale youth’s butt pressed directly against his private parts.\nYouth B reported she couldn’t remember where this occurred in\nthe hall or who else was around. Youth B reported the only other\nsituation where she had a concern was when a youth (couldn’t\nremember who) was slammed to the ground really hard and hit\nher head. Youth B reported Staff 10, Staff 11, an unknown female\nstaff, and an unknown male staff were involved (Investigated\nunder SIR #2019CO108025 dated 12/26/18).\nYouth B reported she never heard or saw anything about youth\nhaving to shower with the shower curtain open and staff watching\nfor the first 30 days after admission. Youth B reported if staff were\nsitting outside the bathroom, they would be unable to see the\nshowers from the door. Youth B reported male staff were never\nallowed in the bathroom and she never saw any male staff in the\nbathroom. Youth B reported only female staff came in the\nbathroom, but she never saw female staff watching any youth\nshower.\n4",
    "Youth B reported Supervisor 1 was the first employee to interview\nher when Youth B was admitted to the facility at 8 years old. Youth\nB reported most youth didn’t like Supervisor 1 because she didn’t\nlet the youth get into trouble and didn’t give into them at all. Youth\nB reported Supervisor 1 wasn’t well-liked because she was 100%\na hard worker and did everything by the book. Youth B reported\nSupervisor 1 wasn’t too hard on them, but she was someone who\nwanted the best for the youth and she showed it by being strict\ntowards them. Youth B reported Supervisor 1 always addressed\nsituations or concerns between youth and other youth or between\nyouth and staff. Youth B reported Supervisor 1 never let anything\ngo, and always made sure the youth were taken care of.\nAttempts were made to interview Youth C via phone on 5/8/25\nand 5/22/25 via phone.

Youth C is currently an adult and does not have\nan open foster care or juvenile justice case.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) for Youth A was interviewed via\nphone on 5/8/25. FCW reported she remembers Youth A but\ndoesn’t remember any facility staff names. FCW reported she\ndoesn’t remember if Youth A had any specific concerns about her\nplacement at the facility because Youth A complained about every\nplacement she was in. FCW reported she doesn’t want to belittle\nany complaints Youth A had but wants it to be known Youth A had\nfrequent complaints. FCW reported the day she brought Youth A\nto the facility, Youth A refused to get out of the car. After a very\nlong time (can’t remember how long), facility staff assisted FCW in\ngetting Youth A to go into the building. FCW reported it wasn’t a\nsingle individual who helped Youth A get into the building, but a\ngroup of staff. FCW reported she vaguely remembers a male staff\npicking Youth A up and carrying her to the door of the unit she\nwas going to, but she couldn’t remember what he looked like or\nany other details. FCW reported Youth A complained about some\nfacility staff but couldn’t remember who or what specifically the\ncomplaints were about. FCW reported Youth A would say things\nlike “I don’t like being restrained”, “I hate it here”, “I don’t need to\nbe in residential”, and “I don’t like staff”, but the complaints were\nall very general. FCW reported she doesn’t remember Youth A\nmaking any complaints regarding male staff doing or saying\nsexually inappropriate things. FCW doesn’t recall Youth A\ncomplaining about male staff watching youth shower for the first\n30 days after admission. FCW reported Therapist never\nmentioned Youth A had any concerns while placed at the facility.\n5",
