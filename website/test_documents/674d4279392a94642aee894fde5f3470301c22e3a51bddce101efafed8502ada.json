A return message was received on June 26, 2024,\nand Complainant reported they had no additional information\noutside of the detailed allegations.\nAssistant Manager was interviewed face-to-face on June 25,\n2024. Assistant Manager reviewed video footage with DCWL\nConsultant and pointed out the amount of time Youth A, Youth B\nand two other youth were left unsupervised in the conference\n2",
    "room. Assistant Manager said she does all the training for the\nfacility and trained Staff 1 to keep eyes on the youth, have them\nmove with her throughout the house as needed. For example, if\nshe needed to make dinner have them either help in the kitchen or\nsit at the dining room table in her line of sight. Assistant Manager\nsaid Staff 1 violated the policy and procedures of the facility by\nleaving the youth unattended for almost four hours, and only\nchecked on them about three times. Assistant Manager said Staff\n1 was immediately suspended pending investigation of these\nallegations.\nYouth A was interviewed via telephone on July 9, 2024. Youth\nA said she was previously placed at Isabella County Non-Secure\nDetention approximately a month ago. Youth A said she was\nplaced with Youth B, and they started out being “friends”. Youth A\nsaid during her placement she was left unsupervised by Staff 1\n“whenever she worked”. Youth A said Staff 1 would be on her cell\nphone and allow the youth in different rooms of the facility without\nher being present or supervising. Youth A said there was a day\nwhen she, Youth B, Youth C and Youth D were allowed in the\nconference room for many hours and Staff 1 was not supervising\nthem. Youth A said during that time she was sitting at the table\nnext to Youth B and he put his hand over her clothing on her thigh\nand said he loved her. Youth A said she told Youth B “you don’t\neven know me” but he did not seem to care. Youth A said Youth B\nthen began to move his hand up her thigh towards her vagina and\nshe told him to stop but he wouldn’t. Youth A said she took her\nhand and tried to move his hand, but he would not stop so she got\nup and started to yell at him. Youth A said Youth B became really\nangry and called her a “ho” several times. Youth A said Youth C\nand Youth D were also in the room however they did not see\nYouth B with his hand on her thigh but did hear her yelling at him\nafterwards. Youth A said Staff 1 heard her “cussing” Youth B out\nand told Youth A she needed to stop talking to Youth B. Youth A\ndenied Youth B doing any other sexual acts or advances. Youth A\nsaid she wrote about the incident in her journal and Assistant\nManager reviewed the journal and saw what she had written and\nimmediately addressed the incident with her and Youth B. Youth A\nsaid after Assistant Manager found out about the incident Staff 1\ndid not work again and she was no longer allowed to be alone with\nYouth B. Youth A said the other staff that worked at the facility\nnever allowed the youth to be unsupervised in other rooms of the\nhouse.\nYouth B’s mother was called on July 11, 2024. Youth B’s\nmother reported Youth B was staying with his father and confirmed\n3",
    "his phone number. Youth B’s father was called on July 15, 2024,\nand July 18, 2024, and the phone number is disconnected. Youth\nB was not interviewed.\nYouth C was interviewed via telephone on July 15, 2024. Youth\nC reported that she was at Isabella Non-Secure Detention Center\nfrom June 8, 2024, until June 17, 2024. Youth C said there was\nusually one staff working in the facility at a time. Youth C said all of\nthe staff would either be in the room with the youth or check on\nthem every five minutes or less except for Staff 1. Youth C said\nStaff 1 allowed youth to be in other areas of the house or outside\nand would check on them “once and a while”. Youth C said there\nwas a day Staff 1 was working and allowed youth to be\nunsupervised for “a long time” in the conference room. Youth C\nsaid during that time Youth B tried to get Youth A “to do\ninappropriate sexual things” with him however she refused. Youth\nC said Youth B put his hand on Youth A’s thigh and moved it up\ntoward her crotch area and Youth A had to move Youth B’s hand\noff her. Youth C said Staff 1 was not supervising when this\noccurred. Youth C said the other staff found out when they read\nYouth A’s journal. Youth C said she did not have anything like this\nhappen to her and she felt safe while at the facility. Youth C said\nshe argued with Youth B often and staff always intervened and\nseparated the youth.\nYouth D was interviewed via telephone on July 15, 2024. Youth\nD said he was placed at Isabella Non-Secure Detention Center\nwith Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C. Youth D said sometimes two\nstaff would be working but mainly it was one staff at the facility\nwith the youth. Youth D said the youth were only allowed to be\noutside if two staff were working. Youth D said all staff except Staff\n1 would make the youth be in the same room as them during\nwaking hours. Youth D said Staff 1 would allow the youth to “chill”\nalone while she was on her phone in the other rooms and would\ncome check on them. Youth D said there was a day when Staff 1\nallowed him, Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C to be in the\nconference room for “a while” and she was in the dining room.\nYouth D said during that time Youth B tried to “cuddle up” on Youth\nA and was rubbing her thigh over her clothing for about fifteen\nminutes. Youth D said Staff 1 did not see this occur as she was\nnot in the room and none of the youth told Staff 1 about the\nincident. Youth D said Youth A did not want Youth B to rub her\nthigh and made him stop. Youth D said he never had anything\nhappen to him while at the facility and he felt safe there.\n4",
    "Staff 1 was attempted to be interviewed via telephone on July\n16, 2024, and July 25, 2024. Staff 1 is no longer an employee of\nIsabella Non-Secure Detention Center. Staff 1 did not answer her\nphone or return the phone call, and therefore was not interviewed.\nVideo Review:\nVideo footage of June 16, 2024, conference room was reviewed\non June 25, 2024. The video footage shows four youth in the\nconference room from 15:57 until about 22:00. Staff 1 is\npositioned on a second camera in the dining room/school area at\na desk for most of the time. Staff 1 only checks on the youth three\ntimes during the duration of the time they were in the conference\nroom. The youth in the conference room move in and out of the\nroom at times. They throw playing cards, books, and games.\nYouth A and Youth B sit by each other several times throughout\nthe video on the same side of the table. Youth A and Youth B’s\nhands move about and are on the table and then under the table.\nThere is no video footage that shows Youth B touching Youth A.\nThere is no video footage of Youth B and Youth A having sex or\nattempting to remove clothing to have sex.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Staff 1 personnel file: Staff 1 had discipline on May 17,\n2024, and May 21, 2024, for not following the facility call-in\nprocedure, and on June 18, 2024, for lack of supervision as\nit pertained to this investigation. Staff 1 participated in\ntraining on February 17, 2024, for all facility policies and\nprocedures including the supervision and “keeping youth in\neyesight”.\n• McBride Quality Care Services Employee Policies\nHandbook was reviewed. The handbook outlines the\nexpectation for Telephones and states “Employees are\nprohibited from carrying personal cellular phone or other\nelectronic devices for the purposes of receiving or initiating\npersonal phone calls or digital communication while on\nduty. Texting is also prohibited while on duty.”\n• Isabella Non-Secure Detention Home Policy and\nProcedures was reviewed. The policy specifically states,\n“Principles of Youth Supervision; Unless participating in an\nactivity approved by administration, youth are never to be\nout of the visual contact of staff. Note: SUPERVISION IS\nTHE TOP PRIORITY OF STAFF.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per video review and\nyouth interviews, Staff 1 did not check on the youth in varying\nintervals not to exceed 15 minutes nor follow the agency policy\nregarding youth supervision and use of personal cellphone. The\n5",
    "agency policies clearly indicate that youth are never to be out of\nsight of staff and that staff are not allowed to use personal\ncellphones while working. Youth reported and were seen for long\nperiods of time unsupervised in the conference room while Staff 1\nis sitting at a desk on her cellphone.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSpecial Investigation dated 1/20/23, CAP approval dated 2/9/23\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n_____________________________________July 25, 2024_\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 26, 2024____\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
