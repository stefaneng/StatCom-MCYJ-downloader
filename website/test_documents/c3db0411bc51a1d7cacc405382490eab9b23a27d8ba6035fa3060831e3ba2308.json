    "ALLEGATION:\nFacility is not always in ratio and sometimes one staff is monitoring two pods.\nSometimes there are no staff to supervise, youth are left without supervision, and\nrooms are left unlocked.\nINVESTIGATION:\nA complaint was received on 6/8/21. The complaint alleged that the facility is not\nalways in ratio. Some staff have been left alone to watch two pods at once. The last\ntime this occurred was on 6/6/21. Staff and youth have confirmed that they are not\nalways in ratio. Youth reported sometimes they do not have a staff to supervise\nthem, and they are told to “self-regulate.” During this time their doors are left\nunlocked, and they are to supervise themselves.\nAt the facility on 6/10/21 the Program Director (PD) was informed of the allegations.\nHe also provided the schedules for the last two weeks. The schedule indicated that\none staff was scheduled on each pod for all AM and PM shifts. Staff 5 was listed as\nworking the PM shift on 6/6/21. The PD reported Pod A had five youth and Pod B\nhad seven youth on 6/5/21 and 6/6/21.\nYouth A was interviewed at the facility on 6/10/21. He resides on Pod B. Prior to this\nday the Pod had 7 youth and now there are 6. They staff one staff on each Pod and\nsometimes one person watches two pods. Staff 5 has been left to watch two Pods\nby herself. She stays in the control room so she can see both pods.\nYouth B was interviewed at the facility on 6/10/21. He reported the facility is not any\ndifferent than a hold facility (detention center). The facility does not do any\ntreatment. He is on Pod B with 5 other youth, the previous day it was 6 other youth.\nThere is 1 staff on each Pod and sometimes 1 staff on 2 Pods. A few days ago,\nStaff 5 was left alone to watch 2 Pods.\nYouth C was interviewed at the facility on 6/10/21. He is on Pod B. The facility is\nshort on staff. His group has been left on their pod alone with no staff. When they\nare short on staff in the \"State\" (DHHS Contracted) pods then the staff move over to\none of those pods. This has happened for an entire morning until they are to step\ndown for shift change at 1:20pm. When they were left alone on their pod there would\nbe a staff on Pod A. When this happens the boys on Pod B are let out of their rooms.\nStaff 1 was interviewed at the facility on 6/10/21. He stated he is a shift supervisor\non midnights. He was currently working the AM shift because he was mandated to\nstay over. He said this happens because they are short staffed. He is used to having\nto stay over and does not mind it. The youth cannot be outside their rooms without\nstaff supervision. The staff walk by the bedrooms and do 15-minute checks while the\nyouth are in their bedrooms. The youth are always supposed to be supervised.\nWhen he works the AM he works on the pod by himself. They had 7 youth on the\n3",
    "pod but one of them left earlier in the morning so now they have 6. On Saturdays in\nthe morning the group has level expectation group, Sunday they do goal sheets and\nsocial living skills. They go to the gym on Saturday and Sunday morning. The TV\ncan be on and Pod B is allowed to watch TV. He has not heard of the boys being on\nthe pod alone. One staff has been responsible for 2 pods before, but it does not\nhappen very often.\nYouth D was interviewed on 6/10/21. He is currently on Pod B. The facility is low on\nstaff. There have been times when one staff will be responsible for 2 pods. The\nyouth on Pod B take care of themselves.\nYouth E was interviewed at the facility on 6/10/21. He is on Pod B. They sometimes\ndo not have staff for their pod. There will be one staff for both pods. This happened\n3-4 days ago with Staff 5. During that time, they have to sit by their door. Staff 5 sits\nin the middle of the control room in order to watch both pods. The staff are not able\nto keep a good eye on them this way and stuff happens like youth walking around\nwithout permission. None of the rules are followed during that time.\nYouth F was interviewed at the facility on 6/10/21. Youth F resides on Pod B. Three\ndays ago, there was no staff on their pod. They ran the pod by themselves. One staff\nwas watching both pods from the control room. His group is mature, so they do what\nthey need to do.\nStaff 2 was interviewed at the facility on 6/17/21. He is a supervisor and has been\nworking at the facility for 4 years. He works morning shift five days a week. Today he\nis working on Pod B. He reported they usually have enough staff to staff all the pods.\nPod A has a state contract and Pod B does not. If they have six youth on Pod A\nthere has to be 2 staff but that is not the case on Pod B. Pod B only needs one staff.\nHe said the only time there is one staff for two pods is when someone is running\nlate. During COVID their staff numbers decreased. He believes they are coming out\nof it, but still have a ways to go. Due to the staffing shortage treatment has been\nlacking and they have to get it back to where it was. The kids respect consistent staff\nthat they have built rapport with making it easier to provide treatment. When they\nhave new staff all the time it is hard to do that. He reported at 1:45pm the youth go\nto their rooms for reflection time for 30 minutes. They do another head count at\n2:15pm then it is the end of the shift. He only works morning shift so he could not\nspeak of what occurs on PM shift.\nStaff 3 was interviewed at the facility on 6/17/21. He was upset and stated he has\nbeen working too much. He is seldom on Pod B. He did not remember the last time\nhe worked on Pod B. He reported only 1 staff is needed for each Pod. He has\nworked two pods with just himself before. He stated he and his co-workers have\nbeen expressing their concerns about staffing every day.\nCase Files: All case files were reviewed for all six youth residing on Pod B. The last\nTreatment Plan completed for each one of them was reviewed. The Treatment\n4",
    "Plan’s indicate Staff 4 was meeting with the youth individually one time a week, they\nwere participating in various group therapy and family therapy for those boys who\nrequired it.\nVideo Review: A video from 6/5/21 starting at 7:45am and ending at 9:28pm was\nreviewed. The youth are by themselves in the day room for most of the day. At one\npoint a staff is seen engaging with the youths, but he is also on his cell phone. The\nvideo for 6/6/21 is the same as 6/5. It starts at 6:26am and ends at 9:27pm. On 6/6\nthe youth are seen trying to get a staff to come to the pod by waving their arms at\nthe camera or going to the pod door.\nOn 6/17/21 a visit was made to Pod B. Staff were present on the Pod.\nStaff 4 Interview: Staff 4 was interviewed via telephone on 6/28/21. She stated she\nis the clinical case manager for Pod B, and she has worked at the facility for 13\nyears. The facility has been out of ratio for a while and sometimes only one person is\nresponsible to watch Pod A and Pod B. When asked she confirmed that some of the\nacting out from the youth was due to being short staffed but also due to lack of\nexperienced staff.\nStaff 5 did not return phone call request for an interview.\nThe facility’s Youth Supervision and Staffing policy states the minimum ratio in\nthe facility is one staff to every five youth on the DHHS contracted pods and one\nstaff to every eight youth on the other pods.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: It was reported by both staff and youth that sometimes both Pod\nA and Pod B are supervised by one staff member. While the\nvideo does not show who was in the control room a staff\nmember is rarely seen engaging or supervising the youth from\nthe dayroom on 6/5 and 6/6. Staff 2 reported Pod A is a\ncontracted pod and Pod B is not. Pod B had seven youth on\n6/5/21 and Pod A had five youth. This is not within the facilities\npolicy which indicates there must be one staff to every five youth\non the contracted pod and one staff to eight youth on the non-\ncontracted pod.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2020C0108068, CAP approved on 11/24/20\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Both youth and staff reported the facility does not currently have\nenough staff. The youth interviewed indicated they do not get\nthe programing that they are supposed to get, and staff\ninterviewed indicated some of the programming is not provided\nwhen the facility is short on staff. The video of 6/5/21 and 6/6/21\ndemonstrated there was not enough staff to properly supervise\nthe youth.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2021C0201016, CAP approved 3/18/21\nSIR 2019C0219045, CAP approved on 10/9/19\nALLEGATION:\nDue to staffing shortages, staff are working double shifts leading to staff sleeping on\nduty.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe above complaint also alleged that staff are being mandated to stay over and\nwork a second shift due to not having enough staff to work. Due to staff being\nmandated to stay after working an overnight shift they are falling asleep while on\nduty.\nYouth A reported some of the staff sleep when they are working. The day of the\ninterview Staff 1 was seen sleeping around 12pm. Youth A has seen Staff 1 sleep on\nthe Pod and in the gym.\nYouth B reported he saw Staff 1 sleeping in the classroom. He was in the back\nsleeping. The teacher was also there. Staff 3 also sleeps. He has been seen\nsleeping in the control room.\nYouth C reported that Staff 1 sleeps. Staff 1 works overnights then stays to work the\nAM shift and that is when he falls asleep. Today Staff 1 was sleeping in their class,\nand he has seen Staff 1 sleeping in the gym.\n6",
    "Staff 1 stated he does not get too tired when working the AM shift but sometimes he\ngets fatigued. When he gets tired, he will walk around or call for a \"28\" which is a\nbreak. Recently he has not fallen asleep, but he did about 2-3 months ago. He said\nthis happened on the midnight shift when he was in the control room by himself.\nYouth D stated some of the staff sleep under blind spots. The midnight staff, Staff 1\nand Staff 3, sleep. Staff 1 was sleeping in the classroom earlier in the day.\nYouth E reported Staff 1 sleeps. Today in the morning on the pod he slept and at\nschool in the classroom. On the pod Staff 1 was sitting next to Youth E when he fell\nasleep.\nYouth F stated sometimes staff get tired from being mandated to stay over. Then\nthey end up falling asleep. He has seen Staff 1 and Staff 3 sleeping. Today Staff 1\nwas sleeping in the classroom.\nStaff 2 reported the staff work a lot of hours. If he notices a staff that is tired, he will\naddress the staff and have them take a break.\nStaff 3 works nights and is mandated every day to stay for the AM shift. On this day\nhe worked the overnight then stayed for the AM shift. He admitted he has fallen\nasleep during work. When he has to work 16 hours a day, he gets tired and nods off.\nVideo Review: A video of the classroom from 6/10/21 was viewed. Staff 1 was\nsitting against the wall. Several times it appears that Staff 1 doses off as his head is\ndown. The teacher enters the room and Staff 1 sits up. He appears to stay awake\nwhile the teacher is in the room.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: The staff interviewed reported they are often mandated to stay\nover from their night shift because there are not enough staff to\ncover the AM shift. Working eight hours after having to stay up\nall night makes the staff tired during the AM shift and they doze\noff. Staff being mandated to cover unfilled shifts indicates the\nfacility does not have a sufficient number of staff to provide for\nthe supervision of the youth.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2021C0201016, CAP approved 3/18/21\nSIR 2019C0219045, CAP approved on 10/9/19\nALLEGATION:\nYouth are disciplined as a group at times and not receiving their privileges.\nINVESTIGATION:\nIt was further alleged that the group is being disciplined when any of the youth act\nup. Staff 4 implements “cease movement” for the entire group in which they are not\nallowed to watch TV, listen to the radio, play games, or have recreation time. They\nare also not allowed to utilize the tables on the pod. The youth are to sit in chairs at\ntheir doors.\nYouth A reported when the group is put on “cease movement” they all have to sit by\ntheir doors and are not allowed to do anything. After school they do not do anything\nuntil dinner. They are not allowed to play games or watch TV. They can go to their\nrooms. They are also required to eat in their chair. Youth A said the group was put\non cease movement about a month ago and they are still on it. They were put on\ncease movement when the entire pod was doing bad. They are supposed to do\ngroups, but the therapist does not do them. The therapist will sometimes meet with\nthem individually.\nYouth B reported cease movement is when they cannot do anything. They are not\nallowed to move around the building except to go to school. They are supposed to\nhave game time during school, but they are not allowed to do that on cease\nmovement. The youth sit and do nothing all day, then at shower time they go into\ntheir rooms. He believes the staff are afraid of the therapist. The therapist told them\nthat the \"state\" (DCWL) does not work the pod therefore they did not have to do\nwhat the state says. The therapist took their TV remote home so they could not\nwatch TV.\nYouth C reported their handbook states they are to have family sessions and\nindividual or group therapy, but they do not get it while on cease movement. They do\nnot do groups or any treatment. Their therapist does not talk to them and does not\nhave family sessions. The therapist took their TV remote home so they could not\n8",
    "watch TV. They have to sit on the floor in the pod to eat dinner. The youth just sit at\ntheir doors and talk all day. They are not allowed to use the multipurpose room or go\nto the classroom.\nYouth D reported Pod B is currently on cease movement which means they have to\nsit by their doors. He stated they were put on cease movement because one of his\npeers had food in his room. He is supposed to get family sessions but doesn't. There\nare no therapy groups. The therapist is in control of everything, and she took away\ntheir TV and radio. The other staff and supervisors are afraid to confront her, so they\nlet her have too much control. The pod is not allowed to participate in gym unless it\nis for school.\nStaff 1 indicated cease movement means the youth are not to move about the\nbuilding due to a safety issue. The managers call it when there is a safety issue. It\nlasts until the safety issue has been resolved. He gave an example of a youth\nneeding to be taken by ambulance and the EMT's needing to go to the pod to get\nhim. The youth were not on cease movement today. When the youth are behaving\npoorly, they can be on cease movement which indicates they cannot move about the\nbuilding, but they can move around the pod.\nYouth E reported the youth on his pod are not allowed to watch TV and the therapist\ntook their remote. They were told this was due to bad behavior however there has\nnot been any write-ups or other consequences. She also took their gym time away.\nThey sit on the pod by their bedroom doors. They have to eat on the pod. They eat\nsiting on the floor and use their chair as a table because the therapist took their\ntables away. The therapist calls this cease movement. They do not receive any\ntreatment or treatment groups. They circle up with the therapist once every 2 weeks\nwhen she wants to move one of them up a level. They do not receive individual\ntherapy. They are supposed to get it every week. The therapist does not talk to them\nwhen they are on cease movement, but she did talk to Youth E when he had court.\nThey eat every meal on the pod, and they are not allowed to use the tables due to\ncease movement. He did not know why they were put on cease movement as there\nhas not been any consequences earned by any of them.\nYouth F stated his group was put on cease movement for no reason. Their games\nand TV were taken away. They go to school, but they are not allowed to go to the\ngym or to the game room. They have to just sit by their doors when on the pod. He\nsometimes meets with his therapist, but it is supposed to be weekly. He probably\nmeets with her once a month. She does not do any groups.\nStaff 2 reported cease movement means the youth cannot leave the Pod. This is\ndone due to behavioral issues. Usually, the entire Pod is put on cease movement\nnot just one person, but it can be done for just one person. He said it depends on the\nbehaviors. The youth are allowed to watch TV and play games depending on their\nbehaviors. The youth go outside on certain days. The therapist decides when they\ncan go outside. They can also go to the gym. A normal day starts with head count at\n9",
    "6:15am. The youth can come out of their rooms after that. They then do their detail\n(clean their room). At 7:30am they do affirmations which is a group in which they talk\nabout their feelings and goals for the day. Breakfast is at 8am. The group eats on\nthe Pod due to COVID. The youth have tables they use when they eat. Then they go\nto school. They are in the same classroom for all of their core subjects then different\nrooms for Art and Gym. 11:30 am is lunch on the Pod. 12:30 they are back in class.\nStaff 4 reported the youth do get therapy on cease movement. She provides\nindividual, family, and group therapy. The youth receive individual therapy one time\na week, group therapy five days a week, and family therapy once a month. The only\ntime the youth did not get their therapy was when they were on quarantine which\nwas about a month ago. One of the youths on the Pod had COVID so the youth\nwere not allowed to leave their rooms. There have also been times when the youth\nwere acting out and they could not meet. She reported she was not comfortable\nmeeting with the youth alone when they were acting out and there was not enough\nstaff to support her. The group was put on cease movement because there was a lot\nof fighting. Two youth “jumped” another youth. Other kids also tried to fight youth\nfrom Pod A. Some youth would not go to their rooms and drew with a marker on the\nwindows and tables. Youth broke the TV and took a fire extinguisher to a bedroom.\nThere was a lot of stuff going on and they were short on staff. The youth were\narguing a lot. Staff 4 said this has been going on since before COVID. The older\nyouth have a \"street mentality.\" She reported there was not enough security to\nbreak up the fights so the only thing she could do was have them in their rooms.\nCase Files: All case files were reviewed for all six-youth residing on Pod B. The last\nTreatment Plan completed for each one of them was reviewed. The Treatment\nPlan’s indicate Staff 4 was meeting with the youth individually one time a week, they\nwere participating in various group therapy and family therapy for those youths who\nrequired it.\nTherapy notes: Therapy notes for the six youth on Pod B were reviewed. The notes\nindicated from 4/30 to 6/9/21 the youth were meeting with the therapist or were\nobserved by the therapist except for two of those seven weeks the youth were not\nmet with as they were on quarantine due to suspected COVID. The notes indicate\nthe youth were receiving case management and not therapy. The therapist would go\nover their level work and their behavior. The notes indicate the group was on \"cease\nmovement\" from 5/12/21 until after 6/11/21 for group members having contraband in\ntheir rooms, getting into a physical altercation, and not following the rules. Family\nsessions were phone calls to the family member and did not include the youth.\nYouth were reprimanded for talking to each other and playing cards while on cease\nmovement. All therapy notes indicate the youth were participating in therapy groups\neven when they were quarantined.\nThe facility did not have any documentation to indicate what cease movement is and\nwhen it is to be used.\n10",
    "The Student Handbook indicates the following:\nLevel system bedtimes:\nLevel 1 bedtime 8pm\nLevel 2 and 3 8:30pm\nLevel 4 9pm\nLevel 5 9:30pm\nConsequences listed are apologizing, doing worksheets, loss of privileges, loss of\nlevel, restitution, thinking table, and alternate programing. The handbook does not\nindicate anything about cease movement.\nAlternate programing is for youth who continually exhibit a disregard for the code of\nconduct and safety. It is a modification of an individual’s treatment plan and program\npath for a specific resident. The thinking table is removing a youth from the group\nand supervised separately. The youth can only talk to staff, they can only have a\nwork assignment to do at the table. They can do recreation with the group but\ncannot interact and they have to eat their meals separate from the group.\nThe Handbook also states the youth are to receive regular physical and recreational\nactivities, family therapy, and group work.\nThe CA reported youth on Pod B were all on level one with the exception of Youth A\nwho was on level 3. This level system is a merit system based on 5 levels with 5\nbeing the highest and 1 being the lowest.\nThe Residential Services Policy states the facility will provide all essential\nelements to the physical and emotional well-being of the youth. The daily routines\nare to keep youth constructively engaged and support the youths emotional and\nbehavioral stability. The schedule listed that groups would be provided daily even on\nSaturday and Sunday.\nThe Video reviewed of 6/5/21 and 6/6/21 indicate all youth went to bed at the same\ntime. Despite Youth A being on level 3. It also showed that the youth did not do\ngroups or engage in activities with the exception of gym.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe discipline,\nincluding any of the following:\n(b) Disciplining a group for the misbehavior of individual\ngroup members.\n(d) Denial of any essential program services, including\nadoption planning.\nANALYSIS: Interviews with the youth and therapy notes indicated the youth on\n11",
    "Pod B were all on cease movement. There is no indication that all\nthe youth were engaging in the negative behaviors.\nThe youth all indicated due to being on cease movement they were\nnot provided with individual, group, or family therapy. The therapist\nnotes indicate individual therapy was minimal and there was no\nfamily therapy. Video of 6/5/21 and 6/6/21 indicate the youth did not\nreceive group as indicated on the schedule and bedtimes were all\nthe same even though one youth was on level 3.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2021C0201024, CAP approved 4/15/21\nSIR 2021C0108004, CAP approved 12/23/20\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies and\nprocedures that describe the institution’s behavior management\nsystem. The policies and procedures shall be reviewed annually and\nupdated as needed. These shall be available to all residents, their\nfamilies, and referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: The youth and therapist all indicate all the youth were on cease\nmovement due to negative behavior, however, the student handbook\nand the facilities policies and procedures do not list cease\nmovement as a consequence.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATIONS:\nYouth are locked in their rooms for extended periods of time.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe above complaint alleged that the youth on Pod B were locked in their rooms for an\nexcessive amount of time.\nYouth A stated at 6:30pm the group does showers. The showers take five minutes\neach and there are two showers on the pod. The youth have to all be in their rooms\nduring showers. After taking their showers they have to go back into their rooms for the\nnight.\nYouth B reported the last time the \"State\" was at the facility they were able to come out\nof their rooms on time but when the \"State\" leaves they come out of their rooms late.\n12",
