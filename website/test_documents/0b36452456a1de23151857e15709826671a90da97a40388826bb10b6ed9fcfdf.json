Allegation and scheduling were\ndiscussed.\nI reviewed the following documents throughout the course of the investigation:\n Sexual Acting Out Precaution (SAO) Residential Round Sheet:\n Observation Process (level of Monitoring) Policy:\n Staff schedule\n2",
    " Incident reports (2)\nI reviewed the Incident reports.\nYouth B’s Incident Report was dated 11/30/21: The therapist was notified on November\n30, 2021 that the youth had consensual sexual interactions. Youth B reported he\n“licked” Youth A’s penis in the corner of his room for 5-10 seconds. The second incident\nYouth B reported he “licked” Youth A’s penis for 5-10 seconds in the corner of the\nbedroom. Youth B reported a third incident occurred where Youth A had his pants\npulled down in the corner of the bedroom and asked him (Youth B) to “anally penetrate”\nhim. Youth B reported he refused to comply. Safety plan was put into place: Youth A\nwas placed in a different room and placed on social isolation (removal from the group).\nYouth A’s Incident Report was dated 12/1/21: The incidents occurred sometime\nbetween 11/4-11/11/21. Youth A reported he and another resident (Youth B) “acted out\non 3 occasions”. Youth A reported it happened while he was on individual focus. Youth\nA reported it happened in the bedroom corner and he reported Staff 1 may have been at\nthe door for one of the three occasions. The other two times Youth B “licked his penis”\nfor 5-10 seconds.\nObservation of bedroom: I observed the bedroom where the alleged incidents\noccurred. The bedroom has a direct line of sight from the door entrance to all three\nbeds. All three beds are sequentially after each other. Once you enter the bedroom,\nthere is a locked bathroom/shower to the left. Then a few steps further the room opens\nup and the beds are one after another. To the left is a corner that is not seen if you\nwould be standing at the entrance of the bedroom. Across from the beds are storage\nunits. There is a security mirror in the top right corner of the room so that there are no\nblind spots in the room.\nInterview of Youth A\nDHHS Social Service Worker interviewed Youth A at Wayne County Juvenile Detention\nCenter on 12/13/21. Youth A reported peers were never allowed to be alone together at\nthe facility nor were they allowed to talk in their bedrooms. Youth A reported he\ndisobeyed these rules with his peer Youth B. Youth A reported there were 3-4 incidents\nwhere he broke these rules. The first incident was when Youth B “exposed” himself to\nYouth A. The second and third time was “mutual fondling”. Youth A reported they\nmutually touched each other’s penis. The fourth time was when there was mutually\nfondled each other’s penis and gave each other “oral”. Youth A reported that none of\nthe incidents were longer than a minute and a half long and happened over a two-week\ntime frame. Youth A reported he was not sure where the staff were when it happened,\nbut they are supposed to be at the door watching them. Youth A reported that Staff 1\nwas there one of the times.\nAll of the following interviews were conducted with DHHS Social Service Worker.\nI\n3",
    "Interview Youth B\nYouth B reported that the rules of the bedroom are as follows: two youth are not allowed\nto be by the cubicles together, during wake-up, there is one youth in the hallway, one in\nthe bathroom and one at their bed. Youth B reported that they (Youth A and Youth B)\nwere able to engage in sexual activity due to them not following the rules. Youth B\nreported that all three of them would be in the room together even if one of them was\nsupposed to be out in the hallway. Youth B reported that staff would watch them but not\ndirect anyone to leave the bedroom. Youth B reported the first incident occurred when\nstaff (unknown) was at the bedroom door talking to another youth in the hallway. Youth\nB reported that Youth A came and sat on his bed and asked if he could give him (Youth\nB) “oral”. This exchange was quick. Youth B reported he stated “seriously” and then\nthey went into the corner of the room and Youth B reported Youth A gave Youth B oral\nfor about 5-10 seconds. The second incident occurred in the morning as well. Youth A\nwent into the corner and then Youth B followed and masturbated Youth A for 5-10\nseconds and then “licked” his penis. Youth B reported that staff was sitting at the desk\nin the hallway but was distracted getting ready for school and talking to the other youth\nin the hallway. The third incident occurred when Staff 3 was supervising the youth.\nYouth B reported he went with Staff 3 to get his medications and then when he came\nback the room light was off and Youth A was in the corner of the bedroom. Youth B\nreported that Youth A wanted Youth B to give him “oral” but Youth B declined. Youth B\nreported Staff 3 sat at the desk in the hallway.\nInterview Administrator 1\nWe interviewed Administrator 1 on 12/14/21. Administrator 1 reported Youth B is on a\n“Sexually Precaution Plan”, (SAO). Administrator 1 reported Youth B is the first bed in\nhis room. Staff are to have direct line of sight. During school Youth B sits next to a\nteacher. Administrator 1 reported Youth B is on SAO due to passing notes or making\nsexual comments. Administrator 1 reported Youth B is not an aggressive youth but can\nbe sneaky. Administrator 1 reported that Youth A has in the past provoked other peers.\nYouth A had physically attacked Youth B in the past. Administrator 1 reported Youth A\nand Youth B share a bedroom with one other peer. This decision was based on that\nYouth A and Youth B do not show any interest in each other as friends or in a sexual\nmanner. Administrator 1 reported that the youth’s bedroom assignments are decided by\ntheir therapist. Each bed has an “umbrella” alarm system surrounding it. An alarm rings\nwhen a child moves into the boundaries of the alarm system. A child would not be able\nto move much in their bed without the alarm sounding off. Administrator 1 reported the\nalarms are turned on when the youth go into their bedrooms for the night. Administrator\n1 reported that there is 1:6 staffing ratio at sleep time. Administrator 1 reported Youth A\nis on an “individual focus”. This means he is removed from the group and placed in his\nbedroom so that he can refocus on his treatment. Youth A received all the same\ninterventions, therapy, and school while in individual focus he was just isolated from the\nrest of the peers. This individual focus occurred between 11/4/21-11/11/21.\n4",
    "Administrator 1 reported there is not a “wake up” or “shower” policy or procedure\nwritten.\nInterview Staff 1\nWe interviewed Staff 1, direct care worker because Youth A reported she may have\nbeen on duty during one of the alleged incidents. Staff 1 reported she works midnight\nshift. Staff 1 reported she is assigned two rooms for a total of six children. Staff 1\nreported they turned the alarms for the beds on when it is bedtime. Staff 1 reported the\nalarms are very sensitive and will go off sometimes if the youth move slightly in their\nbeds. Staff 1 reported 6:30am is wake up time for the youth. Staff 1 reported the\nfollowing practice for wake-up time: One of the youths wake up and go to the bathroom.\nWhile the first youth is in the bathroom the second youth is woken up and makes his\nbed. The third youth is still in in his bed. Once the youth in the bathroom is done, he\nthen goes into the hallway and the second youth goes into the bathroom and then the\nthird youth is making his bed. Then the second youth comes out in the hallway and then\nthe third youth is in the bathroom. No two youth are up and moving around in the\nbedroom together at wake-up time. Staff 1 reported she had never seen two of the\nyouth together in the bedroom and no one has reported any inappropriate behaviors to\nher. Staff 1 reported she is constantly redirecting Youth A. Staff 1 was aware of the\nbackgrounds of the youth she provides care for. Staff 1 did not have any specific\ninformation regarding the alleged incidents.\nWe interviewed Staff 2, Teacher Assistant. Staff 2 reported Youth A and Youth B do not\nget along well. Staff 2 reported that Youth B sits right next to her in class due to Youth B\nexpressing that he wants to sexually act out (no specific other youth mentioned to act\nout with). Staff 2 reported that if they have to go to the bedroom, there is a staff at the\nbedroom door and if there are more than one youth in the bedroom, you must visually\nsee the youth at all times. If anyone communicates while in the bedroom, then all the\nyouth must come out. Staff 2 reported that Youth A was on “Individual focus” therefore\nhe was in his bedroom alone. Youth A would be checked on by the supervisor on duty\nand the floater. Staff 2 reported she had never seen Youth A and Youth B sexually act\nout.\nInterview Staff 3\nWe interviewed Staff 3, direct care worker because Youth B reported Staff 3 was on\nduty during the 3rd incident. Staff 3 reported he watches Youth B very closely. Staff 3\nreported wake up practice is that there is only youth up at a time. The first youth goes\ninto the bathroom while the other two youth are in their beds. Once the first youth is\ndone with the bathroom, he goes into the hallway and then the next youth goes into the\nbathroom, while the third youth is still in bed. Staff 3 reported that when the 2nd youth\ngoes into the bathroom, he allows the first youth to go back into the room to make his\nbed. When he completes this task, he then can come back out into the hallway. Staff 3\nreported that he wakes Youth B up first and Youth A last. Staff 3 reported there are\n5",
    "times that Staff 1 does get distracted and the staff redirect the youth around her to\nsupport her. Staff 3 did not have any specifics regarding the alleged 3rd incident.\nI reviewed Youth B’s Sexual Acting Out Precaution (SAO) Residential Round Sheet:\nYouth B is listed as having “Sexual Acting Out Precautions” (SAO). His level of monitoring\nby staff is to have 15-minute checks but also “direct observation” (line of sight) at all times.\n(All youth are required the 15-minute checks, unless more intensive monitoring is\nrequired).\nThe agency did not have a bathroom or bedroom, or wake-up time policy or\nprocedure outlined.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1, 3 and Youth A and B consistently described the same\nfacility’s identified practice/procedure for morning wakeup.\nWhen facility staff adhere to this practice/procedure adequate\nsupervision is provided to prevent sexual contact as described\nin this investigation. Although specific dates were not provided\nby Youth A and B both report that facility staff did not adhere to\nthe identified practice/procedure resulting in their ability to\nsexual inappropriate behavior.\nThe facility has an identified practice/procedure however this\nrule requires specific written policies and procedures to provide\nfor the care and safety and protection of youth.\n6",
    ".\nTECHNICAL The facility has an acceptable practice/procedure for supervising\nASSISTANCE during wake-up. The facility however must make the\npractice/procedure part of the written program policies and\nprocedures as required by this rule. The facility must also train\nstaff in the written policy procedure to maintain compliance with\nthis rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRepeat Violation 2022C0325042 (CAP pending)\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nA. It is recommended that the license remain unchanged.\n1/13/22\n________________________________________\nVenus M.

    "summary": "Havenwyck Hospital's Impulse Disorder Program failed to prevent multiple incidents of consensual sexual activity between two youths (Youth A and Youth B) in a shared bedroom, which occurred due to staff not following the facility's established wake-up supervision procedure. The investigation found the facility lacked a written policy or procedure for wake-up and bathroom times, violating licensing rules requiring written policies for care, safety, and supervision. Culpability lies with the facility administration for failing to codify and enforce adequate written supervision policies, resulting in a regulatory violation.",
