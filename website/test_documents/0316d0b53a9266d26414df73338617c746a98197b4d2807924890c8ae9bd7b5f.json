DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nCCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\n(1) An institution shall maintain employee records\nfor each employee and shall include\ndocumentation of all of the following information\nprior to employment or at the time specified in\nthis rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan\ndepartment of human services, the equivalent\nstate or Canadian provincial agency, or\n2",
    "equivalent agency in the country where the\nperson usually resides, that the person has\nnot been determined to be a perpetrator of\nchild abuse or child neglect. The\ndocumentation shall be completed not more\nthan 30 days prior to the start of employment\nand every 12 months thereafter.\nOne of fifteen new employee files did not have a central registry clearance\ncompleted within 30 days prior to hire.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not offered any technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe first CAP was a result of the facility's 2023 Renewal Inspection due to\nviolations of Rules 113(1)(e) References, 113(1)(f)(ii) Criminal History clearances,\n113(1)(i) Central Registry clearances, and 119(1) Social Services Worker. As a\nresult, the facility:\n- Obtained new references for those who had references over 12 months\nold.\n- Updated the new hire personnel form to reflect employee file requirements\nand position qualification requirements.\n- Updated clearances for those who did not have clearances run on all\naliases/maiden names.\n- Re-ran central registry clearances for those who did not have current\nones.\n- Implemented a tracking system for central registry clearance completion\ndates.\n- Variance request was submitted for the case manager who did not meet\nqualifications, and the request was approved by the DCWL director.\n3",
    "The second CAP was a result of SIR #2024SIC0001245 due to violations of Rule\n127(4) and ACT 116 - 722.120(1)(c), As a result, the facility provided a staff to\nresident ratio training, proactively created staffing schedules for six months,\ncompleted a training regarding not falsifying documentation, provided a disciplinary\naction to the staff involved in falsification of documents, updated the supervision\npolicy and daily shift log to reflect licensing rule requirements, and completed\nbiweekly video reviews to determine bed checks for youth were being done\nproperly and as staff documented.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's budget and financial audit were reviewed and there were no concerns.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported over all at the facility, things have been going\nwell. CA reported the corrective action plans implemented by the facility have been\nsuccessful. CA reported they have held trainings at biweekly and monthly meetings\nwith all staff to ensure understanding of policies and procedures. CA noted the\ntrainings they've held with staff have had a positive effect and have allowed staff to\nfeel open in asking questions or raising concerns about topics presented.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported the team is solid, and they have excellent teamwork. They reported\nthere's not a lot of staff turnover, so they have all been able to learn and work out\nproblems together as a team. They also feel it adds to more consistency in\nprogramming and interactions with youth. Staff reported the Program Director and\nAssistant Program Director, as well as the staffs' supervisors are always available\nfor questions and support. They reported management is open to feedback, and\nthey all work as a team to implement changes or solutions if identified. Staff\nreported because there's not a lot of turnovers, staff tend to be more comfortable\naddressing uncomfortable issues because there is more trust between them. Staff\nreported any changes in policies, procedures, or safety measures are\ncommunicated well. Staff reported there was approximately a 6-month gap where\nthey didn't have a consistent case management supervisor, so now that they have\none, it has made a very positive difference. Staff reported they feel trainings are\nprovided proactively, and if a suggestion is made about training needs, it is quickly\nimplemented. Staff reported if they need to be redirected, supervisors and upper\nmanagement do it in a proper and supportive way, rather than a punitive way.\n4",
    "Youth reported they feel safe at the facility, staff are great, and staff treat them well.\nYouth reported they like the outings they're taken on as well as school. Youth\nreported the food is good and they get enough to eat. No youth had any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on 11/20/24 and there were no concerns\nnoted. It should be noted there are only youth occupying Building 1 and Building 2.\nCurrently, the facility is not utilizing Building 3 for youth occupancy. However, one\nhallway in Building 3 is set up for youth if needed. The other hallway in Building 3 is\ncurrently being utilized for staff offices.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nNovember 22, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 22, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
