    "A complaint was received on 9/28/21 stating this morning Staff 1 allowed Youth A,\nYouth B, and Youth C to be unsupervised in the classroom bathroom for one to two\nminutes. This put the children out of line of sight. The residents need to always be in\nthe line of sight. There are no allegations anything occurred in the bathroom. The\ngirls hid in the bathroom to play a joke on another staff member to pretend they were\nmissing. Staff 1 thought it would be more believable if just the girls hid in the\nbathroom.\nA similar incident took place earlier this month, Staff 1 hid in the bathroom with the\ngirls to play a joke on the staff. There were no additional allegations at that time. The\nbathroom is a single person bathroom.\nYouth A was interviewed at the facility on 9/29/21. She stated Staff 1 is not working\nat the facility anymore. He was not in the bathroom with her and her peers. They\nwere just joking around. The first time it happened she was not involved. The second\ntime she was in the bathroom with Youth B and Youth C. They were in the bathroom\nto hide from the other staff. Staff 1 knew they were in the bathroom. They just sat on\nthe floor and waited. Nothing happened. Youth A was too upset to answer any more\nquestions. She continuously asked to leave, and she finally became too agitated to\ncontinue so she was allowed to leave the room.\nYouth B was interviewed at the facility on 9/29/21. She stated they were playing a\nprank by hiding in the bathroom so their peers and staff could not see them. While\nthey were in the bathroom the door remained opened and the staff could see them.\nStaff 1 was pretending the girls went on the campus trail by themselves. She said\nthey came out when the other staff found them in the bathroom. Staff 1 was not in\nthe bathroom with them. Staff 1 was the staff that was there both times this\noccurred. Youth B stated the bathroom is a single person bathroom. They are not\nsupposed to be in the bathroom with other youth unless they are getting water and\nare of the same sex. While in the bathroom they squatted on the floor and tried not\nto laugh.\nA tour of the classroom was completed. The teacher was in the classroom. She\nstated one time she found two girls and Staff 1 in the bathroom with the light off and\nthe door closed.\nThe classroom door was on the same wall as the bathroom. The bathroom door\nswung out and would block anyone from seeing into the bathroom from the front of\nthe classroom and from the door into the classroom. The bathroom was a single\nperson bathroom with a toilet and a sink. The teacher’s desk was at the front of the\nroom opposite the door into the classroom. Anyone sitting at the desk could not see\ninto the bathroom or behind the door if the door was open.\nYouth C was interviewed at the facility on 9/29/21. She stated two days ago they\nwere hiding in the classroom bathroom. Staff 1 was in the classroom. The bathroom\ndoor was closed and the light was off. They were hiding so they could scare the\n3",

She stated\none other time her and Youth B were in the bathroom and Staff 1 was at the door\nwith the door cracked open and the light off. Staff 1 was outside the door. She stated\nnothing happened. They all stood on separate walls.\nStaff 2 was interviewed at the facility on 9/29/21. The Chief Programs Officer (CPO)\nsat in on the interview. He stated he is the education specialist. His class was in the\ngym and because it is a co-ed class, he had Staff 1 take the girls back to the class\nahead of him with the boys. He said he left 1-2 minutes after the girls. When he got\nto the classroom Staff 1 was sitting at the desk. Staff 1 told Staff 2 he let the girls\nwalk the trail on campus. He found the girls in the bathroom holding the door closed.\nHe told Staff 1 he could not do that, reported it to the supervisor and wrote an\nIncident Report. A week prior he sent Staff 1 with the girls and when he got to the\nclassroom, he did not see them. He left the classroom to look for them and when he\ncame back the girls were in the classroom. He did not get a chance to follow-up with\nStaff 1. Staff 2 stated he did not have any concerns with Staff 1's boundaries with\nthe girls. He stated Youth C was upset when she heard Staff 1 was no longer\nemployed for the facility.\nStaff 1’s employee file indicated he did not have any disciplines and had been\nworking at the facility since 7/27/21.

He stated in the classroom\nwhere he worked there were three girls and four boys. On this day he took the girls\nback to the classroom from gym. The teacher and Staff 2 took the boys. They were\nfive to six seconds ahead of the boys, so they arrived to the classroom first. Prior to\nthat day they had pulled a prank on the teacher and the girls wanted to do it again.\nHe said there is a single bathroom in the classroom. He sat at his desk in front of the\nclassroom while the girls went into the bathroom with the door opened so the\ncamera in the classroom could see. He was the one to suggest the girls hide in the\nbathroom with the door open. While the girls were in the bathroom, he heard the\ndoor close. The girls were in the bathroom with the door closed for 30 seconds to a\nminute. He stated it just slipped his mind that they were not supposed to be in there\ntogether with the door closed. When Staff 2 came into the classroom Staff 1 told him\nthat the girls went for a walk on the trail. Staff 2 panicked then the girls were asked\nto leave the bathroom. Staff 2 told Staff 1 that they needed to be able to see the\n4",
    "youth. Staff 1 told Staff 2 he was sorry. The supervisor then pulled him aside and\nthe therapist was there. He tried to joke with them by saying “Uh oh. I’m in trouble\nwith the teacher.” He told the supervisor everything that happened, and she sent him\nhome.\nStaff 1 was asked about the previous prank, and he stated the teacher was\nlighthearted and always tried to make things fun. It was the same set up the girls got\nback from the gym before the boys. The girls wanted to pull a prank, so they hid in\nthe bathroom with the door open. He stated with the door to the bathroom opened so\nthe teacher would not be able to see them when she first walked into the classroom.\nHe reported he was standing behind the door and the girls were in the bathroom. He\nclarified and said he had one foot inside the bathroom and the rest of him was out of\nthe bathroom. They were in the bathroom for 20-30 seconds. He stated he thought\nthe teacher found them but reiterated that the door to the bathroom was open.\nThe facilities Staff Ratio Procedures state direct care staff members are required to\nmaintain line-of-sight supervision of the youth except when youth are in their\nindividual sleeping rooms or bathrooms.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents’ needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 admitted he allowed the three girls to enter the bathroom\ntogether and he did not intervene when they closed the\nbathroom door.
