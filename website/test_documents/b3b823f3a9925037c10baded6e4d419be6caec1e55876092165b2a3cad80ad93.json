Youth G reported the\nsafety plan put into place was that Youth F could not speak with\nYouth F any longer however, Youth G also reported they kept\ntalking with each other. Youth G reported Administrator 2 and\nStaff 3 spoke to Youth F and Youth G about the incident several\ntimes. Youth G reported staff tried to keep Youth F and Youth G\napart, but it didn’t work because staff didn’t really care about\nkeeping them apart. Youth G reported none of the other youth\nwere engaging in sex at the facility. Youth G reported she had a\nroom right across the hall from Youth F during this time. Youth G\nreported feeling safe at the facility and having Youth F’s needs\n(food and shelter) taken care of.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 8/22/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker.

    "staff supervising 8 to 9 youth. She reported working 10-hours at\ntimes and up to 12-hours if needed. Staff 3 reported the staffing\nproblems began when Administrator 2 began working at the\nfacility and the number of staff dropped from 10 to 5. Staff 3\nreported Administrator 2 would set a rule and want staff to enforce\nthe rule but when Administrator 2 was working he would allow the\nyouth to break the rule in front of staff.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 8/23/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker.

She reported working at the\nfacility from March 2023 to February 2024. She reported working\nalone on numerous shifts with the responsibility of supervising 10\nto 12 youth at a time. Staff 2 didn’t believe she was able to provide\nthe level of supervision the youth required and still complete all of\nthe other tasks such as conducting intakes of new youth, getting\nitems for youth, making meals, and completing paperwork. Staff 2\nreported making a report to Administrator 1 and Administrator 2\nabout the need for more than one staff supervising at a time and\nthe issues the youth were presenting. Staff 2 would have to break\nup fights alone and would call management for help. She reported\nbecause management’s response was she was told to figure it\nout, she left her position at the facility. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nand Youth B having sexual interaction in the bathroom occurred\njust prior to Staff 2 leaving the facility. She was able to recall\nYouth A but struggled to identify Youth B. After viewing the\ncamera footage, she observed Youth A going into the bathroom\nfollowed a couple of minutes later by Youth B. However, the intern\nwho was with Staff 2 made noise down the hallway and Youth B\ndidn’t enter the bathroom. Staff 2 reported having to get\nsomething from the basement and when returning observed Youth\nB coming out of the bathroom followed by Youth A a few minutes\nlater. This occurred on a Saturday and Staff 2 reported the\nincident to Administrator 2. Administrator 2 told Staff 2 to complete\na write up, which is a corrective action plan. She believed there\n9",
    "was a meeting about the incident on Monday and both youth\nreceived a write up. Staff 2 described the process of dealing with\nyouth breaking the rules as staff completing an incident report,\ndeveloping a corrective action plan for the youth, and having the\nyouth sign a paper acknowledging their responsibility. Staff 2\nreported the youth ignored the policy of not touching each other\neven after staff and management spoke with the youth. She\nbelieved the youth just didn’t care about the rules because there\nwere no consequences for breaking rules.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed via phone on 9/10/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. In regard to the allegation\n(February Youth A and Youth B in the bathroom), Administrator 1\nreported investigating the allegations and they were never\nsupported by Youth A and Youth B of which both denied the\nallegations. Administrator 1 stated the incident was not reported\nby staff but then stated staff did report the youth were in the\nbathroom together. Administrator 2 reported it was only\nspeculation that Youth A and Youth B were having sex in the\nbathroom. He reported finding out about the youth in the bathroom\ntogether when conducting a random check of camera footage.\nAdministrator 1 reported an incident report should have been\ncompleted and that he is seeking this document. In regard to the\nallegation (April or May Youth C and Youth E had sexual\nintercourse and Youth E became pregnant ending in an abortion),\nAdministrator 1 reported Youth C and Youth E having sexual\nintercourse at the facility was never substantiated as the youth\ndidn’t admit to it, and because they were both in the ASF program,\nthey would be off site often. Administrator 1 reported if it did occur,\nit would have been outside of the facility, and he was aware of the\npregnancy but it again stated it was outside of the facility. In\nregard to the allegation (July Youth F and Youth G had sexual\nintercourse), Administrator 1 reported Youth G informed\nAdministrator 1 that Youth G performed oral sex on Youth F\ntherefore there was no vaginal penetration. Administrator 1\nreported Staff 3 reported Youth F and Youth G were in the\nbathroom together. He reported an incident report was completed.\nAdministrator 1 reported the ratio during waking hours is 1 staff for\n10 youth (1:20 during sleeping hours) and that this is within the\nlicensing requirement. He reported staff should always be in a\nclose position to the youth and if needing to move to another area\nof the facility, staff should gather all of the youth together and\nmove them to the same area staff will be in. He reported staff\nhave laptop computers which are tied into the camera system so\nthey can take the laptop with them and still monitor the youth. He\nreported staffing has been an issue and the facility is working on\n10",
    "getting a second staff on every shift. He reported understanding\nthere can be a lack of supervision at times but they are still within\nthe ratio in the policy.\nParent 1 was interviewed via phone on 8/20/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Parent 1 reported Youth B is\nlodged in a Juvenile Facility in Florida at this time.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed via video conference on\n9/24/2024. He reported the facility only keeps video recording for\n30 days before the recording is erased. He also reported the\nefforts being made to increase the staffing ratio to one staff for\nevery 3 youth. Currently, the facility is attempting to fill all vacant\npositions and has several potential applicants. He reported there\nare several position offerings, and they hope to be hiring several\nindividuals very soon. The facility has increased the pay for these\npositions along with increased compensation and other incentives.\nTo provide increased supervision at this time, they are providing\nincentives for staff who are willing to work additional shifts until\nhiring is completed. The facility is working hand in hand with the\nHR department for screenings and interviews in an effort to hire\nthe most qualified individuals. He also reported a belief that a ratio\nof 1:3 is the most workable and will provide the level of\nsupervision to keep youth safe. Currently, there are several other\nindividuals (managers, counselors, and interns) present during the\ndaytime to support staff. These other individuals are not counted\nas part of the ratio.\nSeveral attempts were made to contact Youth B who is\ncurrently lodged in a Juvenile facility in Florida. Phone calls\nwere made on 8/21/24 and 9/3/24 with email attempts made on\n9/5/24, 9/6/24, and 9/10/24.\nVideo Review:\nSince the facility only keeps video recording for 30 days the only\nvideo available is for 7/12/24 (they saved this video because of\nthe allegations. Video recording for 8/8/24 and 8/9/24 is no longer\navailable and census logs indicated neither Youth F nor Youth G\nwere in the program at that time. Youth F was discharged on\n7/22/24 and Youth G discharged on 8/2/24.\n7/12/24 Video recording.
