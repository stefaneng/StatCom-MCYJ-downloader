    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the\nDescription direct supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable\ninterval, eye-on checks of residents. The time between the\nvariable interval checks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A few days prior, staff did not complete required 15-minute checks\non three youth. Checks were completed between 40 minutes to an\nhour, leaving 9 observations omitted.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on\n10/25/2023.\nI interviewed the complainant via telephone on 10/26/2023 who\nreported no additional information.\nI interviewed Consumer Rights Officers at the facility on\n10/27/2023. Consumer Rights Officers reported Deroy has 2\nwings and four bedrooms on each wing. There are currently four\nyouths placed at Deroy. Midnight shift staff are required to\ncomplete at least 32 eye on checks from 11 pm-7 am in 15-minute\nvariable intervals. Staff are required to complete the midnight shift\nsecurity logs reflecting the eye-on checks in real time.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 10/27/2023. Youth A has\nbeen at the facility for 10 days. Youth A reported observing staff\nsitting in the hallway during midnight shift. She said staff don’t\nalways do 15 minutes checks and sometimes it’s over one hour.\nShe expressed no other concerns regarding staff or the facility.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 10/27/2023. Youth B has\nbeen at facility for one week. She reported there is always a staff\nmember supervising. She has observed staff doing routine checks\nat night, but she is not sure how often they do the checks.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 11/16/2023 at the facility. Staff 1 has been\nworking at the facility for one year as a direct care. Staff usually\nworks the afternoon shift in the ILS program, but she also\nsometimes covers the midnight shift at Deroy Hall. She reported\ncompleting eye-on checks on youth if they are in observation\n(suicide watch), but did not have a clear understanding about the\nrequired eye-on check not to exceed 15 minutes in variable\n2",
    "intervals while youths are in their bedrooms.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 11/16/2023 via telephone. Staff 2 has\nbeen working at the facility for 3 months and works the midnight\nshift. Staff 2 has completed all new hire training. She reported\nduring the midnight shift she completes eye-on check on the\nyouths every 15 minutes and documents the checks on the log\nform.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 11/16/2023 via telephone. Staff 3 is a\nTeam Leader and has been working at the facility for 2 months.\nShe reported staff are required to complete eye-on check on the\nyouths during the midnight shift. She said all staff are aware the\nchecks need to be completed in variable intervals not to exceed\n15 minutes. She denied being aware of staff not completing eye-\non checks.\nVideo Footage Reviewed:\nI reviewed video footage of midnight shift (11 pm -7am) from the\nfollowing dates: 10/22/2023, 10/23/2023, and 10/27/20239 (video\nhas no audio). Staff were observed not making eyes on checks in\nvarying intervals not to exceed 15 minutes when youth were\noutside of staff’s sight. During review of the video footage the\nfollowing was observed while youth were in their bedrooms:\n• On 10/22/2023, orange wing, Staff 1 comes on shift at\n11pm Staff 1 completes four eye on checks from 11 pm till\n7 am. There were no youth awake and moving around during\nthese times.\n• On 10/23/2023, orange wing, Staff 2 comes on shift at 12\nam. Staff 2 completes 10 eye-on checks from 11 pm till 7\nam. There were no youth awake and moving around during\nthese times.\n• On 10/27/2023, orang wing, Staff 3 comes on shift at 12\nam. Staff 3 completes 22 eye on checks from 11 pm to 7\nam. There were no youth awake and moving around during\nthese times.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Facility policy for staff to client ratio, dated March 2021.\nSleeping hours staff to client ration is 1:10.\n• Facility policy for client observation dated March 2021.\nClients on all units are to be continually supervised. Staff\nmembers who are responsible for client supervision should\nmaintain line of sight management of those clients at all\ntimes. The supervisor or team leader will complete the\n3",
    "appropriate sections of afternoon and midnight shift\nsecurity checklist form.\n• Midnight shift log dated 10/22/2023, 10/23/2023,\n10/24/2023, 10/25/2023, Orange Wing. Log form has time\npreprinted starting at 11:15, 11:30, 11:45, 12:00,\n12:15…..7:00 am. Staff enter their initials next to each time\nslot indicating they made the eye-on check every 15\nminutes starting at 11 pm through 7 am. Forms indicate\nstaff complete a total of 32 eye-on checks for each date.\nThe notes listed the number of youth in room, and no\nissues.\n• Youth A’s safety plan-crisis prevention plan noted problem\nbehaviors as feeling suicidal and threatening others.\nInterventions were talking to an adult, time out in room,\nsitting with staff, deep breathing, speaking with therapist,\nand snapping bubble wrap.\nAnalysis The facility is non-compliant in performing and documenting eye-\non checks of youth at variable intervals not to exceed 15 minutes.\nBased on Staff interviews and video footage staff are not\ncompleting eye-on checks of each youth at least every 15 minutes\nat varying intervals.\nTechnical Assistance\nIt is recommended that a new form be developed for staff to\ndocument the monitoring of youth while they are asleep or outside\nthe direct supervision of staff. The midnight shift log should not\nhave pre-printed times. Staff should be documenting the actual\ntime at which they conduct a check. This prevents documenting\nchecks that did not occur, documenting checks done at times they\nwere not actually completed, and better ensures checks are done\nat variable intervals rather than giving the impression they are\nrequired every 15 minutes. The agency will need to ensure staff\nhave clear understanding of the rules and agency policies for all\ntheir programs.\nConclusion Repat Violation Established\n2024C0000871SI intake 10/30/2023.
