Youth was not injured\nduring this restraint.\n2",
    "INVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Administrator 1 by phone on 9/23/2021. He reported being the staff\nthat reported the restraint because of the statement Youth A made about being\nsexually assaulted. He reported Youth A entered the school classroom wanting to\nfight with a peer because he was upset over information provided by his Probation\nOfficer. He reported another youth was ready to fight when staff intervened and had\nYouth A leave the room. He also reported the restraint was initiated by him and Staff\n1 after Youth A aggressively pushed Supervisor 1. He reported they placed Youth A\ninto a “Team Control” restraint. He described this hold as staff on either side of\nYouth A with a hand on the shoulder while holding Youth A’s arm. Further\ndescription indicated that their inner leg is placed in front of Youth A’s legs and\nYouth A is bent at the waist. He reported bending Youth A was part of the procedure\nof the restraint and provides better support to keep anyone from falling when there is\nresistance. Youth A calmed down after approximately five minutes and was released\nfrom the hold. He reported Youth A said he was being sexually assaulted. Youth A\ntold him he was being sexually assaulted because they had him bent over.\nAdministrator 1 denied any staff touched Youth A in “his private area” during the\nincident and he provided the names of the other staff present during the restraint. He\nalso provided the name of Youth B who “may have witnessed the restraint”.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 at the facility on 9/24/2021. He gave the same\ninformation and added that he attempted to avoid restraints as much as possible but\nviewed Youth A’s behavior as aggressive towards staff. He also reported Youth A’s\nactions caused an unsafe situation resulting in the need for a restraint.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility on 9/24/2021. She reported being\npresent in the school when she received a “call for assistance at the school”. She\nalso reported arriving on the scene when Youth A was in the “refocus room”. She\nreported Youth A was yelling about “beating someone up and saying he was going\nto tear up everything”. She also reported Administrator 1, Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3\nwhere already in the room trying to verbally deescalate Youth A, so she stood in the\ndoorway. She reported having Youth B with her because he came with her from the\nkitchen area. She reported Youth A pushed her when Administrator 1 and Staff 1\nplaced him in a “Team Control” position. She gave the same description of the hold\nas other staff and denied that anyone touched Youth A inappropriately. She also\nreported Youth A said he was being sexually molested but didn’t recall his response\nwhen asked how.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 9/24/2021. He reported being in the\n“dining hall” with Supervisor 1 when he received an assistance call to the classroom.\nHe reported seeing Youth A who he described as “tripping” pushing Supervisor 1\nbefore being placed in a restraint. He reported staff were talking to Youth A in an\nattempt to deescalate him. He was shown a picture of the “Team Control” position\nand said, “it was just like that”. He reported seeing nothing inappropriate with the\nrestraint. He ended when he reported feeling safe at the facility and having his\nneeds met by staff and the program\n3",
    "I interviewed Youth A at the facility on 9/24/2021. He denied that he was sexually\nmolested and stated, “they made me bend over and it made me feel uncomfortable”.\nHe also denied that anyone touched him inappropriately during the restraint. He\ndenied trying to push Supervisor 1 and reported he just tried to walk out of the room.\nHe reported going into the classroom upset and wanting to fight someone because\nhe was upset because his Probation Officer “was trying to blame me for stuff”. He\nalso reported, “I just said who wants to fight and another youth stood up. I squared\nup and he flinched. He tried to swing but I punched him.” He ended when he\nreported the restraint lasted twenty minutes.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 9/24/2021. He reported the incident,\nmatching what other staff reported. He reported the restraint was initiated after\nYouth A pushed Supervisor 1 and he was placed in a “Team Control”. He described\nthe “Team Control” as pictured in the information provided by the facility and\ndescribed by other staff. He reported hearing Youth A say he was sexually molested\nand when asked how, having Youth A report it was because he was bent over. He\nalso reported the restraint was appropriate in all aspects. He ended when he\nreported spending forty-five minutes after the restraint talking with Youth A to help\nhim process the incident.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 9/24/2021. He gave the same account of the\nincident as other staff present. He reported being in the classroom when Youth A\nattempted to fight other youth and going to the refocus room with him. He reported\nthe restraint was initiated when Youth A pushed against Supervisor 1 and the\nrestraint was appropriate. He described the restraint as the “Team Control”. He\nnever observed any sexual abuse by staff.\nI interviewed Staff 3 at the facility on 9/24/2021. He reported the incident\noccurring in the same way as other staff reported the incident. Additionally, he\nreported Youth A punched another youth before being removed to the refocus room.\nHe reported the restraint was initiated because staff believed Youth A may harm\nsomeone else after pushing Supervisor 1. He denied any sexual touching by staff\nduring the restraint. He ended when he reported the restraint was appropriate.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\nI reviewed the personnel files for Administrator 1 and Staff 1. They are up to date on\ntraining and have no documentation of any disciplinary action.\nI reviewed the Residential Initial Treatment Plan for Youth A. This document is dated\n7/7/21 and covers a period of 6/9/21 to 7/7/21. Goals identified include learning to\ncope with his emotions in a safe and productive manner under the Emotional\nStability Behavior domain. Development of independent living skills under the\nHousing and life skills domain. A goal of understanding consequences relative to\nnegative behavior patterns under the Peer/Adult social relationships domain. A goal\nof developing a lifestyle free of substance abuse under the substance abuse\n4",
    "domain. A goal of understanding aspects of his life that have made him feel\nvictimized under the victimization domain. Each of the goals has appropriate desired\noutcomes, action steps and services provided to address the needs.\nI reviewed the behavior management policy/procedure. This document states “Any\nphysical behavior management intervention will be used as a last resort and after\nnonphysical techniques are exhausted. To promote safety a team approach (two or\nmore staff) is the expected practice when intervening with acting out students.”\nI reviewed the “Safety-Interventions – High-Level Holding in a standing position\nTeam Control Position”. This document has a picture of the hold described by staff\nand Youth A and matches their description. The “control dynamics” are described as\nManaging the arms to reduce upper-body strength, managing the incline to reduce\nlower-body strength and managing mobility through close body contract.\nI reviewed the incident report of the restraint that occurred on 9/23/2021. This\ndocument identified the staff involved and Youth A as taking part in the restraint. The\nrestraint and events leading up to it are described just as staff and Youth A\ndescribed the incident. There is documentation that the restraint lasted\napproximately five minutes and occurred at 9:40 AM. It is also documented that no\nmedical follow-up was needed.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews and written\ndocumentation do not support the allegations of staff\nmishandling Youth A during the restraint or engaging in sexual\nabuse of Youth A. Evidence suggests Youth A was very upset\nand engaged in aggressive behaviors, thus the restraint was\ninitiated in a safe manner. Youth A also reported he was just\nfeeling uncomfortable rather than being sexually molested.\nTechnical Assistance:\nIt was suggested to the facility that a system of support is\ndeveloped to help youth deal with possible negative news they\nmay receive from their workers or other outside contacts. This\nprocess could involve having a staff they are comfortable talking\nwith or their therapist available following these contacts. The\nfacility reported having several different systems in place at this\ntime.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that this investigation be closed with no change made to the\nlicense of this Child Caring Institution\n9/30/2021\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 1, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
