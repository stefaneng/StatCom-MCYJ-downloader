    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP submitted by the agency was in response to the 2023 interim licensing\ninspection and was approved on 6/5/2023. That agency addressed 8 non-\ncompliances within that CAP, 5 of which were addressed successfully as\nevidenced by those non-compliances not being repeated during this year's\ninspection. Three of the noncompliances addressed in that CAP were repeated\nthis year (medical passports, adoptive family evaluation timeliness, and adoption\nclosing summary timeliness) and will require additional corrective action planning\nto address why the previous actions taken were not effective.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment identified areas of the previously submitted\nand approved CAP that were not successful, such as the document/checklist\nimplemented to assist in improving timeliness of adoption reports. Additionally, the\nchief administrator identified challenges with rule/policy compliance due to staff\nperformance issues that have been addressed through documented corrective\naction as well as failure on the part of staff to obtain and upload documents timely.\nThe Chief Administrator indicated the previous CAP was effective, resulting in no\nfurther incidents of non-compliance, in areas such as confidentiality, medical\npassports, PATP signatures, and family team meetings. The only discrepancy\nfound during this inspection was related to medical passports as one file did not\ncontain a replacement medical passport signed by the caregiver timely. During the\nexit meeting it was determined the foster care supervisor misunderstood the\ntimeframe requirement for this document; therefore, the noncompliance was not\nidentified internally.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency's budget, financial statements, and independent auditor's report were\nreviewed, and no concerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via video conferencing. One staff\nreported she will be leaving the agency soon but did not express any concerns\nwith the agency. All three staff reported receiving regular and frequent supervision\nand stated the program director provides timely information and trainings related\nto policy and rule changes/updates. No concerns were identified by any of the\ninterviewed staff.",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has adequate space and office equipment to perform the required\nfunctions of foster care, licensing, adoption, and independent living services. Files\nand physical CHRI are stored securely in a manner that prevents unauthorized\naccess. There is a cross shredder located in the main building.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nMay 6, 2024\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 7, 2024\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
