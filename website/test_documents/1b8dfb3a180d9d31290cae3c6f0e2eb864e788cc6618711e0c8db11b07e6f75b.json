Youth C reported he told staff (couldn’t\nremember who) that Youth A and Youth B were about to fight.\nYouth C reported Staff 4 was in the milieu watching them at the\ntime, but he was writing something down. Youth C reported when\nStaff 4 looked up from what he was doing, Youth A and Youth B\nwere already fighting on the floor. Youth C reported Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 separated Youth A and Youth B by pulling Youth A off\nYouth B, and putting him to the side, but no one threw Youth A to\nthe side.

Youth C\nreported Staff 1 pushed Youth A away from the TV because Youth\nA tried to break it again. Youth C reported Staff 1 pushed Youth A\ninto the chair in the TV area, but he doesn’t think Staff 1 was\ntrying to hurt Youth A or intentionally push him down. Youth C\nreported he believes it was just an accident. Youth C reported\nstaff continuously tried to verbally de-escalate Youth A, but he\ndidn’t listen.\n3",
    "Youth C reported at one point, Youth A threatened Staff 1 with a\npencil, therefore Youth E tried to fight Youth A, but Staff 2 stepped\nin, pushed Youth E backwards, and told him to stay out of the\nsituation. Youth C reported eventually he and the rest of the youth\nwere told to go to their rooms to allow Youth A to calm down.\nYouth D was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/17/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth D reported he was\nin his room when he woke up to Youth A and Youth B screaming.\nYouth D reported when he got into the milieu, Staff 3 told him\nYouth A and Youth B began fighting, which Youth D reported is a\ncommon occurrence. Youth D reported Youth A and Youth B tried\nto run towards each other, but Staff 1 and Staff 2 stopped them.\nYouth D reported Staff 4 was in the office making calls. Youth D\nreported Staff 1 let Youth A into the milieu bathroom and Youth A\nbroke the mirror, toilet and sink. Youth D reported then Youth A\nbegan fighting with Youth B again. Youth D reported Staff 1\nrestrained Youth A so he couldn’t keep punching Youth B. Youth\nD described the restraint as Staff 1 picking Youth A up from\nbehind and then holding his arms. Youth D reported Staff 1 never\nthrew Youth A to the ground. Youth D reported Youth A punched\nthe TV a couple of times, but he never saw Youth A get pushed.\nYouth D reported Youth E tried to run towards Youth A, but Staff 1\nput his arm out to stop him, and then Youth E went back and\nstood by the table. Youth D reported after a little while Staff 5\ncame onto the unit and Youth D and the rest of the youth went to\ntheir rooms.\nYouth E was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/17/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth E reported he came\nback from work, went to his room, and then came back out of his\nroom. Youth E reported Youth A was on the unit trying to break\nthings to hurt himself. Youth E reported Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3\nwere trying to keep Youth A away from sharp objects. Youth E\nreported Youth A kept saying he was going to kill staff with the\npencil he had. Youth E reported Staff 2 held onto Youth A while\nStaff 1 tried to get the pencil away from him. Youth E reported\nYouth A went to the ground on his own, and Staff 1 pulled Youth\nA's fingers apart to get the pencil away from him. Youth E reported\nat another point, Youth A was trying to hit one of the staff\n(wouldn’t say who), therefore Youth E tried to fight Youth A. Youth\nE reported he was pushed away from the situation by a staff\n(wouldn’t disclose who). Youth E would not discuss any parts of\nthe situation further.\n4",
    "Staff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/17/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported he and\nStaff 3 were about to take the youth to kid’s club to do an activity.\nStaff 1 reported he and Staff 3 went to the office to grab some\ngaming controllers. Staff 1 reported Youth B and a few other youth\n(didn’t specify who) were going, but Youth A wasn’t allowed to go\ndue to behaviors. Staff 1 reported when he and Staff 3 were in the\nstaff office, they saw Youth A and Youth B fighting, therefore he\nand Staff 3 separated them. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was nearby,\nbut he didn’t think Staff 2 helped separate the youth. Staff 1\nreported Youth A seemed like he still wanted to fight Youth B\ntherefore, Staff 1 and Staff 3 encouraged Youth B to go to his\nroom to separate from Youth A, which Youth B agreed to do. Staff\n1 reported Youth A was still escalated, but he decided to go to his\nroom with Staff 2. Staff 1 reported Youth A was throwing things\nand making loud noises in his room. Staff 1 reported while Youth\nA was in his room, Youth B came back into the milieu. Staff 1\nreported Youth A came out of his room, looked into the milieu from\nthe hallway window, and then he came into the milieu again. Staff\n1 reported there was a brief fight between Youth A and Youth B\nbefore they were separated again, and Youth B went back to his\nroom.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A went into the milieu bathroom and there\nwere some loud noises and then a big boom. Staff 1 reported\nwhen Youth A exited the bathroom, Staff 1 saw the toilet was\nbroken and there was water coming out from the toilet seat. Staff\n1 reported Youth A tried to break things around the milieu and TV\nroom. Staff 1 reported he tried to block anything that could\ncompromise the safety of the program (i.e. key fobs that could\nprevent exit). Staff 1 reported Youth A began engaging in property\ndestruction towards the key fob and fire alarm stations. Staff 1\nreported he was blocking Youth A when Youth A pulled a sharp\npencil out of his pocket and pointed it towards Staff 1. Staff 1\nreported he reached out, grabbed the pencil out of Youth A’s hand\nand put it in the staff office. Staff 1 reported Youth A began to\nbang on the TV, and he tried to block Youth A from the TV so\nYouth A wouldn’t break it and create more sharp objects. Staff 1\nreported Youth A tried to hit him in his face a couple of times, so\nStaff 1 put his arms up to block Youth A. Staff 1 reported Youth A\napproached him with his hand in his pocket, so it looked like Youth\nA had another sharp object. Staff 1 reported he put his arms out to\ncreate space when Youth A came towards him and Youth A\nstumbled back and fell. Staff 1 reported Staff 5 arrived to provide\nsupport and after Staff 5’s arrival, Youth A seemed to regulate.\nStaff 1 reported he tried to talk to Youth A later in the evening, but\n5",
    "Youth A refused to talk to him. Staff 1 reported it’s possible he\npushed Youth A when Youth A was running towards Youth B to\nfight him. Staff 1 reported if he pushed Youth A, he didn’t shove\nhim with force, and only kept his arms out to keep space and/or\nblock Youth A. Staff 1 reported when Youth A and Youth B were\non the ground fighting at one point, he pulled Youth A off of Youth\nB. Staff 1 reported he doesn’t remember throwing Youth A to the\nside, and reported it wasn’t his intention to do so. Staff 1 reported\nat one point, Youth E tried to get involved in the situation by trying\nto fight Youth A, therefore Staff 1 stopped Youth E and pushed\nhim backwards to stay out of it.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/17/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported after\ntransition time, he, Staff 1 and Staff 3 were standing by the staff\noffice talking about what was going to happen the rest of the day\nwith the youth. Staff 2 reported his back was facing the unit. Staff\n3 was facing the unit and told Staff 1 and Staff 2, Youth A and\nYouth B looked like they were going to fight. Staff 2 reported he\nand Staff 1 separated Youth A and Youth B. Staff 2 reported\nYouth B was taken to his room and away from the situation. Staff\n2 reported shortly later, Youth B came back out into the milieu for\nsome reason, and Youth A went back to fight him. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 and Staff 3 broke up the fight, and Youth B was brought\nback to his room. Staff 2 reported Youth A began to tear up the\nunit. Staff 2 reported Staff 4 made calls to nursing and Staff 5 for\nsupport. Staff 2 reported Youth A threatened to stab Staff 1 a\ncouple times and then hit him. Staff 2 reported Youth A found a\npencil in the crevice of a chair and found another pencil another\ntime during the incident. Staff 2 reported Youth A also broke off a\npiece of plastic from the fire alarm station. Staff 2 reported Youth\nA hit him in the chest twice and hit Staff 1 in the chest a couple\ntimes, while also continuing threats towards them. Staff 2 reported\nwhen Youth A was in the TV room, he was trying to bust the TV\nglass apart. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 initially blocked the TV, but\nthen Youth A tried to stab Staff 1 with a pencil. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 tried to grab the pencil out of Youth A’s hand, and as that\nhappened, Youth A fell backwards. Staff 2 reported Youth A\ncomplained Staff 1 pushed him and stated his butt hurt. Staff 2\nreported he didn’t see Staff 1 push Youth A because Staff 1’s\nback was facing Staff 2 and Staff 2 couldn’t see around Staff 1.\nStaff 2 reported he wasn’t sure if Staff 1 pushed Youth A, or if\nYouth A fell off the chair because he was standing on it and lost\nhis balance. Staff 2 reported at one point, Youth A looked at his\nwrists and said to Staff 1, “oh yeah, you’re fired”, but Staff 2 wasn’t\nsure what Youth A saw on his wrists to make him say that.\n6",
    "Staff 2 reported Youth E and Staff 1 are close, so when Youth A\nkept targeting Staff 1, Youth E tried to get involved and defend\nStaff 1. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 got in between Youth A and Youth\nE to stop Youth E. Staff 2 reported he didn’t feel Staff 1 pushed\nYouth E and stated Staff 1 moved in between the two youth with\nhis hand out to stop Youth E. Staff 2 reported when Staff 5\narrived, he sat down with Youth A, and they began to process the\nsituation. Staff 2 reported Nurse 1 also processed with Youth A\nwhen she arrived, gave him an Ibuprofen and gave him his PRN\nmedication. Staff 2 reported Youth A complained about his butt\nhurting and about a scratch on his hand. Staff 2 reported he and\nNurse 2 went with Youth A to his room to examine him and there\nwas no bruising on his butt.\nStaff 2 reported he and Staff 4 processed the situation with Youth\nA approximately 10 minutes after Nurse 1 left. Staff 2 reported\nasking Youth A what happened because he’s been doing so well.\nYouth A told Staff 2 earlier in the day his foster care worker told\nhim he might not be going to his home visit the upcoming\nweekend because his level dropped at the facility. Youth A\nexplained in his mind his foster care worker told him no even\nthough she said she would think about it. Youth A reported he felt\nhe did all the work at the facility for nothing. Staff 2 reported Youth\nA showed remorse for his actions and took accountability. Staff 2\nreported before he left for the day, he processed with Youth A\nonce more about actions, consequences, etc. Staff 2 reported he\nfeels he and the other staff could have gotten the other youth into\ntheir rooms and away from the situation quicker. Staff 2 reported\nhe did not see any staff doing anything in appropriate during the\nincident. Staff 2 felt they were doing a lot to verbally de-escalate\nYouth A and encourage Youth A to do better.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/17/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported he went\nto get the gaming controllers for kid’s club and when he went back\ninto the milieu, Youth A and Youth B were fighting. Staff 3\nreported he separated Youth B away from Youth A and took him\nto his room. Staff 3 reported when he came back into the milieu,\nYouth A was upset and pacing. Staff 3 reported Youth A was\nbrought to his room to calm down. Staff 3 reported Youth B came\ninto the milieu to ask if he could come out of his room, and he was\ntold yes. Staff 3 reported Youth A then came out of his bedroom\nhallway and attacked Youth B. Staff 3 reported Youth A and Youth\nB fell on the floor as they were fighting. Staff 3 reported Staff 1\nstood over Youth A, straddled him, and pulled Youth A off Youth\n7",

Staff 3\nreported Youth A was upset about the fight and began pacing\nagain. Staff 3 reported Youth A began trying to destroy the key fob\nreaders, fire alarm stations, and TV. Staff 3 reported he and Staff\n1 kept blocking items so Youth A couldn’t destroy them. Staff 3\nreported he left to retrieve food for dinner, and when he came\nback, the incident was still occurring. Staff 3 reported Youth A\nstood on a chair to try to break the TV. Staff 3 reported Youth A\nalso tried to fight him, Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 3 reported\nthroughout the incident, Youth A had two different pencils, a pop\ncan topper, and a plastic piece off the fire alarm cover in his\npocket. Staff 3 reported he repeatedly tried to use these objects to\nstab Staff 1. Staff 3 reported Youth A kept going towards Staff 1\nand Staff 1 held his arms out to keep space between them. Staff 3\nreported Staff 2 told him he walked past the TV room and heard\nYouth A say Staff 1 pushed him, but Staff 3 reported he didn’t see\nwhat happened.\nStaff 3 reported Staff 4 was in the staff office the entire time, so\nStaff 3 kept walking around the unit to keep things in check and\nassist with the youth. Staff 3 reported at one point Youth E tried to\nfight Youth A because Youth A tried to fight Staff 1. Staff 3\nreported Staff 1 pushed Youth E away from the situation. Staff 3\nreported when Staff 5 arrived, Youth A began to calm down. Staff\n3 reported Nurse 1 then came and gave Youth A his PRN\nmedication, which calmed Youth A down completely. Staff 3\nreported the only thing they should have done differently during\nthe situation was get the other youth off the unit while staff were\nhandling the incident with Youth A.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/17/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 reported Youth A\nand Youth B were having a conversation with Youth C. Staff 4\nreported he’s not sure what was said or what happened in the\nmoment, but he could immediately tell the conversation had\nshifted a bit. Staff 4 reported Youth A and Youth B began fighting\neach other and fell to the ground. Staff 4 reported Staff 3 got\nYouth B away, and Staff 1 stayed with Youth A. Staff 4 reported\nStaff 3 took Youth B to his room to get him out of the milieu, which\nYouth B agreed to. Staff 4 reported when Staff 3 returned, Youth\nA was with Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 4 reported Youth A began\nscreaming, pacing, and threatening staff. Staff 4 reported Youth A\nkept trying to find things to break (TV, throwing a chair, punching\nthings on the wall such as the fire alarm and key fob). Staff 4\nreported Youth A threatened to stab Staff 1 with a pencil he had in\n8",
    "the middle of the incident. Staff 4 reported Staff 1 took the pencil\nout of Youth A’s hand by grabbing it without any struggle. Staff 4\nreported he was keeping the time log and made the required calls\nto nursing and evening campus security. Staff 4 reported Staff 1\nand Staff 3 put Youth A in a level one AEGIS hold and then\nreleased Youth A because he calmed down. Staff 4 reported after\nStaff 1 and Staff 3 released the hold, Youth A escalated again, so\nthey had to re-engage. Staff 4 reported Staff 2 was the shift\nsupervisor, so he was watching the entire incident. Staff 4\nreported he was watching while he was making calls. Staff 4\nreported he had to go out to the back of the building because\nevening campus security (couldn’t remember the staff’s name)\nwas outside and couldn’t get in. Staff 4 reported when he and the\nother staff (couldn’t remember his name) came into the unit, Staff\n4 helped lead Youth C, Youth D and Youth E to their rooms and\nout of the area.\nStaff 4 reported when he returned to the milieu, Youth A was in a\nhold by the windows (couldn’t remember which staff were\ninvolved), and then they moved Youth A to the chairs in the TV\narea and let him sit there for a bit. Staff 4 reported Youth A tried to\nbreak the TV and the chairs. Staff 4 reported Nurse 2 came onto\nthe unit and gave Youth A his PRN medication and some water.\nStaff 4 reported Nurse 2 took Youth A to his room and to the\nbathroom to talk to him and view his injuries as Youth A was\ncomplaining about his tailbone hurting and bruises on his hand.\nStaff 4 reported he didn’t see anything inappropriate happening,\nsuch as pushing or pulling, by any staff during the entire incident.\nNurse 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/24/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Nurse 2 reported he\nexamined Youth A on 7/17/25 for a bruise on his butt. Nurse 2\nreported Youth A had a bruise on his buttocks approximately 4-5\ninches in diameter, which was dark purple. Youth A told Nurse 2\nhe received the bruise from someone (didn’t say who) pushing\nhim into a chair. Nurse 2 reported Youth A did not complain of\nbeing in pain.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 7/14/25 was reviewed. It should be noted the\nvideo does not have audio. Youth A and Youth B get into an\naltercation with Staff 4 watching. It appears to begin as playful but\nthen ends up with Youth A and Youth B on the ground fighting\nwith each other. Staff 3 separates Youth B and takes him to the\nside of the room. Staff 1 and Staff 2 separate Youth A to another\nside of the room and then Staff 1 moves away while Staff 2\n9",
    "continues to watch Youth A. Youth A then goes around Youth C to\ntry to get to Youth B. Youth B has his arms up preparing to fight.\nStaff 1 stops Youth A and guides Youth A on his upper arms into\nthe corner and blocks him into the corner against the wall so he\ncannot get out; however, Youth A isn't fighting against him. Staff 1\nbacks up and Youth A walks into the milieu. Staff 1 stands in\nbetween Youth A and Youth B while Staff 2 follows Youth B to\nensure nothing else happens and guides Youth B out of the milieu\ninto the bedroom hallway.\nYouth A begins pacing around the milieu. Youth A goes to the\ndoor for Youth B's bedroom hallway, but cannot get in. Staff 1 and\nStaff 3 come out of Youth B's bedroom hallway with Youth B.\nYouth A tries to attack Youth B, but Staff 1, Staff 2 & Staff 3 stop\nhim by getting in front of Youth A to block him. Youth B runs away\nto the other side of the room. Youth A tries to go after Youth B\nagain and Staff 1 blocks his way again. Youth A goes into his\nbedroom hallway with Staff 2. Staff 1 enters the bedroom hallway\n(which is off the camera view). Staff 3 is in the milieu with Youth B,\nYouth C, and Youth D. Staff 1 and Staff 2 come back into the\nmilieu with a chair. Youth A is still in the bedroom hallway/his\nroom. Youth A comes out of his bedroom hallway and immediately\ngoes after Youth B, but Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3 get in between\nthem. Youth A goes into the milieu bathroom. Youth A comes into\nthe milieu and then goes back into the bathroom again. Youth A\ncomes out again and immediately goes after Youth B. Youth B\npunches Youth A, and then Youth A tackles Youth B to the\nground. Youth B keeps punching at Youth A. Staff 1 intervenes by\nstanding over straddling Youth A, grabs Youth A around his torso,\npicks him up and throws him away from the situation, onto the\nground, and Youth A lands on his side. Youth B gets up and is\ntaken away from Youth A by Staff 3. Staff 1 is still with Youth A.\nYouth A gets up, squats on the floor, and then stands up. Staff 1\nstands by Youth A and blocks his way from getting to Youth B.\nStaff 3 takes Youth B to his bedroom hallway.\nStaff 1 gets out of Youth A's way since Youth B is in his bedroom\nhallway. Youth A walks towards his bedroom hallway door and\nkicks it with his right foot. Then he goes into the TV area where\nYouth C is sitting and kicks a chair with his right foot. Staff 1 tried\nto stop the chair from falling over and set it on its side. Youth A\nwalks into the milieu area with Staff 1 following him. Youth A hits a\ndoor and then goes and stands in a corner. Staff 1 opens the\nkitchen door and Youth A tries to go into the kitchen but Staff 1\nblocks him from entering. Youth A continues to pace around the\nmilieu with Staff 2 and Staff 1 watching/following. Youth A kicks a\n10",
    "door and punches the fire alarm pull station with his right hand.\nYouth A then walks into the living room and hits the TV with his\nright hand. Youth C is sitting down in the TV area with Staff 1 and\nYouth A. Youth A walks back into the milieu and Staff 1 continues\nfollowing him. Staff 4 and Staff 2 are blocking fob readers (as\nYouth A has broken those in the past). Youth A looks like his fist is\nclenched or he has something in his hand. Staff 1 follows Youth A,\nand Youth A turns to face Staff 1. Staff 1 grabs Youth A's right\nwrist/hand/forearm and they struggle over what is in Youth A’s\nhand before something falls to the ground. Staff 1 holds onto\nYouth A's right wrist while Staff 1 uses his other hand to pick the\nobject off the floor. Staff 1 lets Youth A go once he picks it up and\nthen Staff 1 walks into the staff office.\nYouth A tries to break the fire alarm pull station by punching it\ntwice with his right fist and once with his left. Staff 1 exits the staff\noffice. Staff 3 is next to Youth A and begins following Youth A to\nthe milieu front door. Youth A hits the fob reader with his left hand.\nSomething falls to the ground and Staff 1 picks it up. Staff 1, Staff\n2 and Staff 3 are in the front corner with Youth A, but it is unclear\nwhat's happening as it's off camera view. Youth A kicks Staff 1.\nStaff 1 is on one side of Youth A and Staff 3 is on the other side of\nYouth A and it looks like they're in a standing two person AEGIS\nhold, but it’s hard to tell as the camera only shows from\napproximately their waists down. Youth A thrashes and Staff 1\nand Staff 3 shuffle with him in the restraint and away from the wall.\nStaff 1 and Staff 3 walk with him away from the wall, and the\nrestraint is appropriate. Staff 1's hand is on the back of Youth A's\nhead to protect himself from head-butts from Youth A.
