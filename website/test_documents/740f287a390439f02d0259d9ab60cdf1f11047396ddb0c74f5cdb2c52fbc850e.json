The agency was cited for 14 violations, 12 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 12, there was an improvement in individual incidents\nof non-compliance within six of the violation areas (performance evaluations,\nplacement outlines, FTM's, supervisor approval, PATP and medical passports).\nThere was a slight increase in the number of individual incidents in 4 areas\n(physical characteristics, timely service plans, IL contracts and 1105's). Two areas\nremained the same (medicals and youth pictures).\nIn 2022, 15 violations were established, 11 of which were repeated this year. All of\nthe repeated violations remain close to the same number of individual incidents of\nnon-compliance, with the exception of IL contracts which showed a decrease this\nyear and PATP with showed an increase this year. The agency will need to\nestablish additional corrective planning for the repeated violations to ensure a\nreduction of incidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The Chief Administrator\nindicated the agency has experienced some challenges in meeting requirements\nover the review period. A short turnaround time on some documents, issues with\nMISACWIS, and dental providers cancelling appointments at the last minute are\nsome of the barriers noted in the assessment. The assessment noted the agency\nconducts regular reviews of the CAP, quarterly CAP activities at staff meetings\nand file reviews completed by staff as well as Quality Assurance.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisors and coworkers are available to assist as\nneeded. Staff did not report any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis agency is not contracted with MDHHS to provide foster care placement or\ncertification services; therefore, this is not applicable.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n__________________________________9/24/2024_____________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/3/2024\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
