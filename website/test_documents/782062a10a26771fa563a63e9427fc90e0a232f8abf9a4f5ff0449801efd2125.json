It states an incident occurring on\n01/03/2023 between Youth A and Staff Person 1 in which Youth A hit\nStaff Person 1 in the face and that Staff Person 1 pushed him resulting\nin him hitting his head. Youth A did not have any injuries, marks, or\nbruises from being pushed and hitting his head and Youth A refused to\ngo to the hospital.\n2",
    "I reviewed incident report dated 01/03/2023. It states Youth A was\nbeing disruptive and refusing to go into his bedroom. Staff Person 2\ninformed Youth A that his game would be taken away if his negative\nbehaviors continued. Youth A attempted to take the game away from\nStaff Person 2 and then aggressively hit Staff Person 1 in the face with\na closed fist. Youth A then attempted to leave the floor and\naggressively charge at Staff Person 1 who held her hands up in a\nprotective stance. Youth A ran into Staff Person 1 falling to the floor\nand hitting his head on his bedroom door.\nI attempted to interview Youth A onsite on 01/05/2023 with DHHS\nWorker. He did not want to be interviewed as he was sick. Youth A\nwas then interviewed onsite on 01/13/2023 with this writer and DHHS\nWorker. He reports being inside his bedroom with Staff Person 2 when\nhe reached over Staff Person 2 to Staff Person 1 who was standing in\nhis doorway noting that he does like her. Youth A then stated that Staff\nPerson 2 exited the bedroom and that he also attempted to exit the\nbedroom calmly at which time Staff Person 1 pushed him for no reason.\nYouth A contradicts himself by saying that he was attempting to leave\nthe bedroom to get calm. Youth A states that he fell to the floor\nbumping his head to his bedroom door and states he was crying. He\nthen reports getting up and then entering his bedroom. Youth A states\nhe refused to see a doctor though notes that Staff Person 1 was aware\nof his head having a bump though does not recall when she saw it.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 onsite on 01/05/2023 with DHHS Worker.\nShe reports being employed by the facility five months though has\nworked at another company facility for four years with no disciplinary\nissues. She also reports being up to date on her required Therapeutic\nCrisis Intervention training. Staff Person 1 reports Youth A being upset\nand having mood-swings the evening of 01/03/2023 during bedtime\nprocedures as he was walking in and out of his bedroom. She reports\nStaff Person 2 was inside his bedroom taking away a game and that\nshe was standing in the doorway. She reports Youth A reached around\nStaff Person 2 and punched her in the face as she just stood there.\nStaff Person 1 reports Staff Person 2 addressed Youth A’s behaviors\nwith consequences and that Staff Person 2 exited the bedroom. Staff\nPerson 1 stated she stood just outside Youth A’s bedroom when he ran\nout and charged right at her. Staff Person 1 reports raising her arms in\na protective stance when Youth A ran into her and that he fell on his\nbutt and bumped his head to his bedroom door. Staff Person 1 denies\npushing Youth A purposefully to the floor as he alleges.\nI interviewed Staff Person 2 onsite on 01/05/2023 with DHHS Worker.\n4",
    "She reports being inside Youth A’s bedroom as he began tearing it up\nbecause he was not allowed to have his game anymore and he was\nstating how he did not like Staff Person 1. Staff Person 2 reports\nstanding in between Youth A and Staff Person 1 when Youth A reached\nover her shoulder to punch Staff Person 1 who was just standing there.\nShe reports Staff Person 1 removed herself from the doorway area and\nstood in the hall. Staff Person 2 left the bedroom and proceeded to\nwalk down the hall when she heard Youth A exclaim how much he\ndidn’t like Staff Person 1. Staff Person 2 reports turning around and\nobserving Staff Person 1 in a protective stance and Youth A standing\nthere. Staff Person 2 states she did not observe Youth A falling or\nbeing on the ground and notes that he walked back inside his bedroom.\nLater on in the evening Staff Person 2 reports observing Youth A sitting\nin the hallway and that he did report being pushed by Staff Person 1.\nShe reports the next day that Youth A informed her that his head was\nhurting because of being allegedly pushed by Staff Person 1 the\nprevious night. Youth A declined seeing medical personnel.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite on 01/13/2023 with DHHS Worker. He\nstates he was standing in the hallway when Youth A came out of his\nbedroom and rushed toward Staff Person 1. He reports Staff Person 1\nput her hands out in front of her and that Youth A ran into her and that\nhe clumsily fell. Youth B states Staff Person 1 did not push Youth A as\nhe alleges. Youth B also states that minutes prior Youth A reached\nover Staff Person 2 and punched Staff Person 1 in the face.\nI interviewed Youth C onsite on 01/13/2023 with DHHS Worker. He\nstates being inside his bedroom with the door closed and observed the\nalleged incident involving Staff Person 1 and Youth A through his\nwindow. Youth C states Youth B wanted to leave the floor and ran out\nof his bedroom when Staff Person 1 grabbed him and threw him into\nthe door.\nI viewed the area in front of Youth A’s bedroom where he fell with\nDHHS Worker. The positioning of Youth C’s door window would not\nhave allowed him to view Youth A run into Staff Person 1 as he reports\nobserving from inside his bedroom.\nAnalysis There is no conclusive evidence to support Youth A’s allegations that\nStaff Person 1 pushed him on purpose causing him to fall to the floor\nand bump his head. According to Staff Persons 1 and 2 and Youth B,\nYouth A ran out of his bedroom and charged at Staff Person 1 who\npositioned her hands in a protective stance and did not push him.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLSIHED\n4",
