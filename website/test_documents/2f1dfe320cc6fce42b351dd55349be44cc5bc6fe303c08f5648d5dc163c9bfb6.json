Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nAgency Worker was aware an adult was residing in the same foster home as a\nfoster youth and failed to do a background check on the adult. It is alleged that the\nman is being investigated for sexually abusing the child.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 12/3/2020 I interviewed the complainant by phone. She reported that she\nbecame aware of this concern when a complaint came into DHHS regarding the\nsexual abuse of a foster child placed in an unlicensed relative caregiver’s home. The\ncomplainant stated that Youth A was placed with his aunt, Relative A and, at some\npoint, Caregiver B moved into Relative A’s home. Relative A caught Caregiver B\nsexually abusing the child in the home. The complainant reported that she believed\nYouth A’s foster care case manager was aware that Caregiver B had moved into the\nhome, but no background checks were completed. Relative A left the home with\nYouth A and went to stay with her daughter, but her daughter would not allow\nworkers access to her home, so Relative A and Youth A were supposed to stay at a\nhotel. Relative A instead returned to her home and when a worker called Relative\nA’s phone number, Caregiver B answered. The complainant believed a safety plan\nwas in place but was unsure if it was followed. Youth A was then removed from\nRelative A’s care and placed in an unrelated foster home.\n3",
    "On 12/3/2020 I interviewed Administrator 1 by phone. Administrator 1 stated that she\nhas recently been appointed as the Chief Administrator is trying to get an\nunderstanding of the series of events. She stated that she had minimal information\nand doesn’t know when Caregiver B moved into the home or if the worker was\naware that he had. She stated that the worker is currently on leave pending this\ninvestigation and that the worker’s supervisor was terminated from her employment\nin early November for unrelated reasons.\nOn 12/8/2020 I interviewed Program Manager (PM) 1 and Program Manager 2 via\nMicrosoft Teams. PM 1 became FC Worker 1’s supervisor in early November of this\nyear. She stated that after the DHHS complaint was received alleging the sexual\nabuse of Youth A an internal meeting was held during which PM 1 asked FC Worker\n1 if Caregiver B had any criminal history. FC Worker 1 stated at that time that she\nhad previously dropped off “the paperwork” to Caregiver B to complete a\nbackground check, but he never returned it, so no background checks were\ncompleted. PM 1 stated that there is no paperwork to complete in order to run\nbackground checks, rather the worker need to provide the name and information to\nthe administrative assistant who can run an ICHAT check within an hour. PM 2\nstated that Relative 1 was in the process of adoption but had waived licensure. She\nstated that an updated home study was completed in August at which time a\nlicensing staff, an adoption staff, and a foster care staff were present and there was\nno indication at that time that Caregiver B was living in the home.\nOn 12/9/2020 I interviewed DHHS Worker 1 by phone. He stated that he received an\ninvestigation regarding the alleged sexual abuse of Youth A on 11/21/2020 then\nreceived an additional allegation last week stating that the relative caregiver was not\nfollowing the established safety plan. He reported that he interviewed FC Worker 1\nwho told him she knew that Caregiver B had been living in the home for about a\nmonth. DHHS Worker 1 reported that Caregiver B’s name is on the lease and his\nname is on the mailbox. He reported that Relative A reported that Caregiver B\nmoved into the home after she sustained a leg injury to help her care for the child\nand that he had been in the home for 4 months.\nOn 12/10/2020 I interviewed FC Worker 1 by phone. She reported that the first time\nshe heard about Caregiver B was in late March. She stated that Relative A had\nidentified Caregiver B as a friend or her caregiver, at different times. During early to\nmid-November, she had suspicions that Caregiver B had moved into the home\nbecause she noticed Relative A’s personal belongings in the living room. When\nasked about it, Relative A stated that she was just moving things around. FC Worker\n1 did see some AXE body spray and a man’s shoes in Relative A’s bedroom. When\nshe asked Relative A about these items, she stated that Caregiver B had left them\nthere and would be retrieving them after his work shift. FC Worker 1 reported that\nher understanding was that Caregiver B was at Relative A’s home for a couple of\nhours during the day to help clean areas Relative A couldn’t reach and other\nhousehold chores, but didn’t help with the care of Youth A. After this home visit, FC\n4",
    "Worker 1 asked the licensing supervisor and the assigned adoption worker to keep\nan eye on this. FC Worker 1 stated that she could typically only coordinate home\nvisits with Relative A in the evenings which is when Caregiver B allegedly worked.\nFC Worker 1 reported that she asked Supervisor 2 about running background\nchecks on Caregiver B in March. Supervisor 2 told FC Worker 1 that it was not a\nhigh priority because of prudent parenting standards, but instructed her to complete\na central registry check. FC Worker 1 stated that she dropped off a central registry\nclearance form for Caregiver B to fill out. She couldn’t remember the date she\ndropped this off, but she never received the form back. She stated that she asked\nRelative A multiple times for Caregiver B’s birthday, but Relative A did not remember\nit. FC Worker 1 stated that they can run an ICHAT once they receive the information,\nbut she never got a birthday, so she never did this. She did state that she ran a sex\noffender registry check a couple of months ago but could not remember the date or if\nthis was documented.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12309 Records check.\n(1) An agency shall, upon receipt of an application, request\nthe department of state police to conduct both a criminal\nhistory check and a criminal record check through the\nfederal bureau of investigation for applicants. The\nagency shall also request the department to conduct a\ncriminal history check on all persons residing in the\nhome over 18 years of age. Additional checks shall\npertain to previous licenses, and substantiated child\nabuse and neglect records for all applicants and\npersons residing in the home 18 years of age or over in\nMichigan and in all states where the applicant has\nresided in the 5 years preceding the application.\nANALYSIS: FC Worker 1 did not complete background checks on Caregiver\nB despite suspecting that he lived in the home with Relative A.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 12/8/2020 I interviewed Program Manager (PM) 1 via Microsoft Teams. PM 1\nstated that a safety plan was put into place requiring that Relative A leave the home\nshe shared with Caregiver B and stay with her daughter, that Caregiver B was to\nhave no contact with Youth A , and that Caregiver B was to leave the home. Relative\nA ended up not being able to stay at her daughter’s due to her daughter refusing to\nallow any workers into her home. Caregiver B was then instructed to stay at a hotel\n5",
    "with Youth A. PM 1 instructed FC Worker 1 to make face to face contact with Youth\nA and Relative A at the hotel, but FC Worker 1 made her face to face contact in a\nparking lot somewhere.\nOn 12/10/2020 I interviewed FC Worker 1FC Worker 1 reported that on 11/24/2020\nher current supervisor, PM 1 told her that Relative A needed to go to a hotel with\nYouth A. FC Worker 1 stated that she couldn’t get a hold of Relative A that night, but\nleft her message stating that she needed to go to a hotel. FC Worker 1 was able to\nreach Relative A the next morning by phone at which time Relative A agreed to go to\na hotel with Youth A. FC Worker 1 stated that she needed to verify Youth A’s\nwellbeing, so Relative A brought him to the agency parking lot, where FC Worker 1\nmet with them and saw his items in the car. Relative A reported that they were going\nto the hotel. The agency was closed on Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving, so\nFC Worker 1 followed up by phone with Relative A on the following Monday,\n11/30/20. Relative A reported that she had not gone to the hotel but would go after\nthe phone call. FC Worker 1 was able to verify through a visit that they were at a\nhotel that day. The next day, FC Worker 1 drove by the hotel and saw Relative A’s\ncar still there. The following day, FC Worker 1 was trying to reach Relative A and\nwhen she didn’t answer her phone, used an alternate number given by Relative A.\nWhen she called that number, Caregiver B answered and stated that Relative A and\nYouth A were at the laundromat but would be returning to the apartment within the\nhour.\nOn 12/5/2020, PM 1 sent me an emailed copy of the safety plan provided to Relative\nA by FC Worker 1 as this has not been uploaded into Youth A’s file. The safety plan\nwas dated 11/24/2020 and documented the requirements as reported by PM 1 and\nFC Worker 1 and at the end of the plan FC Worker 1 wrote that she would be visiting\nRelative A and Youth A on 11/25/2020 “in whatever living arrangement ends up\nplaying out.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training\nto perform the duties assigned.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: FC Worker 1 did not demonstrate the ability to perform the\nfunctions of her assigned duties when she was instructed by her\nsupervisor to visit Youth A and Relative A to verify that they had\nleft the home, which FC Worker 1 agreed to do, but instead saw\nthe youth in the parking lot of her office. Subsequently, it was\ndiscovered that the relative had not stayed at a hotel, as she\nwas instructed to do.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that, upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, no\nchange be made to the license of this private child placing agency.\nDecember 22, 2020\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 28, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
