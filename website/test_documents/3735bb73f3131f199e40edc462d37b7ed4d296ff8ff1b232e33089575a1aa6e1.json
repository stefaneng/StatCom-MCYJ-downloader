The licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nDescription administrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff\non duty to perform the prescribed functions required by these\nadministrative rules and in the agency’s program statement and to\nprovide for the continual needs, protection, and supervision of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation - Facility believes a youth should be on one-to-one supervision but\ndue to MDHHS not approving the funding of the one-to-one\npayments there has been inconsistency of the one-to-one staffing\nbeing provided.\n- Concerns overall on the supervision being performed by staff\ndue to staff always being on their cell phones.\n- Concern that a youth went AWOL during the community outing\ndue to lack of supervision of the staff on the outing with the youth.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via phone on 1/11/2024. She\nreported receiving the information from an anonymous source who\nrefused to release any identifying information. Complainant\nreported the facility is struggling with services to Youth A because\nof Youth A’s disruptive behaviors. The one-to-one supervision for\nYouth A has been discontinued by both the facility and the\nreferring county. Youth A struggled with the direct supervision and\nbecame more dysregulated, so it was ended. Complainant also\nreported staff are not allowed to use their cell phones during the\ntime they are working, and the cell phones are to be locked up.\nThis was instituted because staff were using their cell phones\nduring work hours. Complainant provided a copy of the incident\nreport involving Youth B going AWOL.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported Youth A has been in the program for the\npast year and completed all of the requirements. MDHHS has\nbeen aware of this situation and not presented an appropriate\nreplacement yet. Youth A has regressed and struggles to regulate\nher emotions because of the uncertainty of Youth A’s future\nplacement or lack of placement. The one-to-one was discontinued\nbecause Youth A struggled with the extra attention and staff are\nnow following a safety plan which appears to be working for Youth\nA. The one-to-one was ended in November 2023. She reported\nthe phone use by staff has been addressed and new guidelines\nhave been discussed during team meetings. These team meeting\n2",
    "notes will be provided. The staff are not to use their phones for\npersonal use when in the milieu and supervising youth and\nAdministrator 1 also reported not observing staff using their\nphones in the milieu. She reported knowing Youth B AWOLed and\nstated Youth B had no history of AWOL ideation or risk that the\nprogram was aware of. Youth B was described as being very\ncompliant up to the time of the AWOL.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported Youth A is not on one-to-one status and\nis not presenting as needing one-to-one supervision. Administrator\n2 also reported MDHHS is not supporting one-to-one supervision\nfor Youth A and that the clinical team supports the level of\nsupervision (safety plan with normal supervision) Youth A is\ncurrently on. In regard to the cell phone allegations, Administrator\n2 reported this has been discussed in team meetings and she will\nprovide the minutes of those meetings. She has informed staff\nthey are not to use their phones for personal issues when in the\nmilieu or supervising youth. Staff are allowed to take their phones\nwith them when taking youth off site but still not to use them for\npersonal issues. Administrator 2 was on personal leave at the time\nof Youth B going AWOL and had no information to provide.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported the same as Administrator 2 in regard to\nYouth A needing and receiving one-to-one supervision. She also\nreported staff are not to use their phones for personal issues in\nthe milieu but in the past staff would use their phones to\ncommunicate if something was occurring with a youth and they\ninform other staff of the issue. They would text so the youth were\nnot privileged to the communication. Now, staff are to find other\nways to communicate without the use of the phone. She had no\ninformation about Youth B’s AWOL because she was not present\nnor working that day.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She gave a similar report about the one-to-one\nsupervision of Youth A. Youth A was on one-to-one in the past but\nno longer needed such supervision. That level of supervision was\ndiscontinued because Youth A no longer needed it not because of\nany funding issues. The supervision was never funded by\nMDHHS. Supervisor 1 also reported about a couple of months\nago, staff were told not to use their phones in the milieu and the\nstaff have been following this direction since then. She reported\nstaff use to text between themselves when it related to suspicious\nbehaviors but not longer do and will talk before or at the end of the\n3",
    "shift. If it is something that needs to be discussed immediately,\nstaff will keep supervision but stand outside of youth hearing them\nto speak to each other. Supervisor 1 had no information about the\nAWOL with Youth B because she was not present nor working\nthat day.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported Youth A was originally placed on one-to-\none supervision to help Youth A feel more secure. However,\nYouth A reported feeling very restrictive and stifled with this level\nof supervision. Youth A did not present with any self-harming\nbehaviors, and it was clinically decided to stop the one-to-one\nafter a meeting with Youth A’s worker. Supervisor 2 also reported\nthere was never a funding issue and the decision to place Youth A\non one-to-one was the clinical team’s decision as was the reason\nto remove that level of supervision. In regard to the issue of cell\nphone use in the milieu, Supervisor 2 reported staff are not to use\ntheir phones in the milieu and then only for safety or if information\nis needed outside of the milieu. Supervisor 2 had no information\nabout Youth B’s AWOL because she was not present nor working\nthat day.\nTherapist was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. Therapist reported Youth A did not have an assigned\none-to-one supervision level until a meeting with the MDHHS\nworker. The decision to place Youth A on that level of supervision\nwas the result of an incident when Youth A was attacked by\nanother youth (this incident was dismissed as a special\ninvestigation). A clinical decision with the MDHHS Worker\nresulted in Youth A being taken off one-to-one supervision and all\nstaff were informed of this decision. Therapist reported personal\nphones are not to be used in the milieu, but the supervisor is\nallowed to use a personal phone for emergencies. Staff are not to\nhave their phone visible in the milieu and need to lock the phone\nup. This information was provided during team meetings and has\nbeen effective for a couple of months. Therapist had no\ninformation on Youth B going AWOL but never heard it was\nbecause of a lack of supervision.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported Youth A was not on a one-to-one\nsupervision level and is on a safety plan to avoid incidents. Staff 1\nnever believed Youth A needed that level of supervision. Staff 1\nreported staff’s personal phone must not be seen in the milieu and\nplaced in the office or off the unit. Staff are not to make personal\ncalls and only use the phone outside of the milieu for\n4",
    "communication between staff by texting. Staff 1 also reported\nworking when Youth B went AWOL and received a phone call\nfrom the Staff 5 and Staff 6 who were supervising the outing. She\nwas given the same report that is documented in the Incident\nReport outlining the AWOL. She had no concerns about the\nsupervision provided by staff. Staff 1’s only recommendation to\nthe staff supervising the outing was they should have been on the\nice with the youth during the skating time.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported feeling safe at the facility and has several\nstaff that she is comfortable speaking with when struggling with\nsomething. These identified staff include Therapist who is very\nhelpful. Youth A believes she is not receiving help in finding new\nplacement and wants to move to independent living as soon as\npossible. She believes staff are provided the appropriate level of\nsupervision for her and other youth.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported Youth A is not the youth on one-to-one\nstatus and is supervised appropriately. She identified Youth F as\nthe youth on one-to-one supervision and believes Youth F\nreceived one-to-one supervision “most of the time” but because of\nstaff shortages at times and on outings Youth F is not always\ngetting one-to-one. Staff 4 reported her example for this belief is\nwhen there is an outing involving three staff to six youth and views\nthis as one staff to two youth even when their ratio is one staff to\nthree youth. She also reported a belief that normally the facility\nwould send four staff with six youth. In regard to personal cell\nphone use, Staff 4 reported in a couple of team meetings in the\npast the facility tried to find a solution to staff using their personal\ncell phones while working. Staff 4 also reported being the\nindividual who brought this issue to administration’s attention.\nStaff 4 believes the administration is working on this issue and has\nmade progress by limiting the use of personal phones in the\nmilieu. Staff 4 based her belief on this concern because “staff\nhave their own kids, and they need to pay attention to our kids”.\nStaff 4 had no information about Youth B’s AWOL.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported being on the outing in which Youth B\nwent AWOL and said Staff 5 and Staff 6 were not really\nsupervising the youth during the outing because both were not on\nthe ice with the youth. Youth C also reported there were “lots of\ngirls who looked like Youth B” at the rink and it was very crowded.\nYouth C reported Staff 5, and Staff 6 made a diligent effort to find\n5",
    "Youth B when it was discovered Youth B was missing. Youth C\nreported feeling safe and taken care of at the facility.\nYouth D was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported being one of the youths on the outing in\nwhich Youth B went AWOL. She stated the skating rink was\ncrowded and after the buzzer sounded to clear the rink, everyone\nlost sight of Youth B in the crowd. She reported hearing from\nanother youth (unable to identify who) that Youth B was planning\non going AWOL if given the chance but is unsure if this statement\nwas true. Youth D also reported Staff 5 and Staff 6 were watching\nthe youth skate and only lost sight of Youth B when Youth B\nbecame mixed into a large crowd. Youth D reported feeling safe in\nthe program and that the program is really helping her make\nchanges.\nYouth E was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/16/2024. She reported being a youth on the outing in which\nYouth B went AWOL. She stated, “crazy how she got away with it”\nbecause staff were watching us. She also reported Youth B took\nadvantage of the crowd and snuck out of the building. She\nreported feeling safe at the facility and that the program is very\nhelpful to her.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 1/19/2024. She reported\nbeing one of two staff supervising the youth on the outing in which\nYouth B went AWOL. The reason the staff were not on the ice\nduring the skate was because Staff 6 had no skates that were her\nsize and Staff 5 had nerve damage in her leg that kept her from\nskating. She also reported both staff were standing next to the rink\nand just on the other side of the Plexiglass, so they were able to\nview the youth on the ice. When the buzzer went off ending the\nfree skate, Youth B disappeared into the crowd. Staff 5 denied\nthey took their eyes of the youth during the outing. She also gave\nthe same report outlined in the Incident Report. She gave a similar\nreport about use of personal cell phones are not to be used in the\nmilieu and if staff need to communicate, they should step into the\noffice. She also reported using a cell phone the day of the incident\nat the skating rink to inform the facility of what had occurred. She\nreported knowing that Youth F is on one-to-one supervision. She\nalso reported Youth F was scheduled to attend the outing but\nbecause there were only two staff available to supervise, Youth F\nwas not allowed to go because they would not have been able to\nmaintain the one-to-one with two staff and five youth.\n6",
    "MDHHS Supervisor and MDHHS worker were interviewed via\nphone on 1/19/2024. Both reported never requesting a one-to-\none supervision of Youth A. They also reported Youth A continues\nto be placed at the facility because there is no appropriate\nplacement available within the State of Michigan at this time.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via phone on 1/25/2024. She reported\nbeing one of two staff supervising the youth on the outing in which\nYouth B went AWOL. She provided the same report about the\nincident as Staff 5 and what was written in the incident report.\nStaff 6 reported the skating rink had no skates that fit her, so she\nwas unable to go on the ice with the youth but both staff kept their\neyes on the youth while the youth skated. At first, they stood near\nthe exit door but had a clear view of the rink before moving to the\nseats the hockey players use. Both Staff 5 and Staff 6 were able\nto view the entire rink the whole time. Youth B disappeared in the\ncrowd at the end when everyone was leaving the rink at the end of\nskating. Staff 6 reported staff have been told not to use their\npersonal cell phones during work hours and are to place their\nphones in the office when in the building. She also reported\nchecking for messages prior to the beginning of her shift. This\npractice began several months ago and presented during team\nmeetings. Staff 6 reported Youth F is on one-to-one supervision\nbut not all the time. She also reported the one-to-one supervision\noccurs when Youth F is off campus and struggles as outlined in\nthe request. Staff 6 also reported the facility has enough staff at\nthis time and there is no staff shortages.\nYouth F was interviewed via phone on 1/25/2024. Youth F\nreported no concerns and feeling safe at the facility. Youth F also\nreported the program is helping her make changes and staff are\nvery helpful. Staff support Youth F and provide one-to-one\nsupervision at times especially when she needs the support.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nIncident Report 170870214 dated 12/31/2023 for Youth B. This\nreport outlines Youth B going AWOL during an off-campus activity.\nThe incident occurred at a local indoor ice-skating rink. Staff 5 and\nStaff 6 observed Youth B skating and supervised her throughout\nthe skating time. When leaving, there was a large crowd of\nindividuals leaving the rink and this is when Staff 5 and Staff 6 lost\nsight of Youth B in the crowd. Staff 5 and Staff 6 began to ask\nother youth if anyone observed Youth B and Staff 6 was told by\none of the youth (could not identify which) that Youth B was sitting\noutside of the rink area on a bench tying her skates. When Staff 6\n7",
    "reached the bench, Youth B was not present. Staff 5 stayed with\nYouth C, Youth D, and Youth E while Staff 6 did a diligent search\nof the building before moving outside of the building.

The requested\none-to-one supervision was approved for the period of 11/8/23 to\n2/23/24. Rational for this level of supervision was given as Youth\nF continues to present with self-harming behaviors (superficial\ninjuries), stealing, lying about conflicts she has begun, and limited\nprogress. The facility requested to have the one-to-one\nsupervision for only 16 hours per day and then only “after school,\nweekends”, and when it appears Youth F needed additional\nemotional support. The overall focus will be to provide the clinical\nsupport for Youth F that she needs to continually address her\nmental and emotional health needs.\nBilling invoice for 1:1 with Youth F November 2023.
