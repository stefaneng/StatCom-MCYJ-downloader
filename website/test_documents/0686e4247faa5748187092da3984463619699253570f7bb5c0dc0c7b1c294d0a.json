After\nthe initial evaluation, a written evaluation must be\nconducted every 12 months.\nThree of three employee files did not have performance evaluations completed\nwithin the past year.\nCPA Rule 400.12417 Foster parent information\n(2) For an emergency placement, if any of the\ninformation specified in subrule (1)(a) to (h) of this rule is\nnot available at the time of placement, then the agency\nshall provide information to the foster parent within 7\ncalendar days of the placement.\nOne of three foster care files did not have placement information documented as\nrequired.\n2",
    "CPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n(5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents\nand the foster parents in the development of service\nplans to enable the parent or parents and foster parents\nto understand the plan for the child and the parents' and\nthe foster parent's role in assisting the agency in carrying\nout the plan. An agency shall give a copy to and review\nthe parent-agency treatment plan with the parent or\nparents and foster parents. The agency must inform the\nparent or parents and foster parent that the information\nin the parent-agency treatment plan and any other\ninformation about the child and the child's family is\nconfidential.\nTwo of three foster care files held treatment plans that did not have signatures by\nthe foster parent or youth to indicate the plan was provided to or reviewed with\nthem.\nCPA Rule 400.12605 Adoptive family evaluation\n(1) An agency social service worker shall complete a\nwritten adoptive evaluation within 90 days of the family\nsigning an adoption application and prior to approving a\nfamily for adoption.\nThree of three adoption files held family assessments that were not completed\nwithin the required timeframe.\nFOM 722-06B Pg 5 Family Team Meeting\nFTMs must occur within the required time frames as\noutlined in the following tables:\n• Updated Case Plan (USP) - within 30 calendar\ndays before the case plan due date.\n• At least three business days prior to a planned\nchange of placement or no later than three\nbusiness days after an unplanned placement\nchange.\nTwo of three foster care files did not have an FTM completed within 30 days prior to\nthe USP due date.\nOne of three foster care files did not have an FTM completed within the required\ntimeframe for placement change.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED: 4/3/2023 RENEWAL, CAP approved\n4/17/23\n3",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Borrowed Beds- Per the CWLM User Guide, Borrowed Bed agreements and\naccompanying documentation should be uploaded in the general documents\nsection of the provider record. When a Borrowed Bed agreement begins, the\nloaning agency must assign a staff person from the borrowing agency as a\nsecondary worker.\n• CPR/First Aid certification- Licensing rules require certification in CPR/First\nAid. Passing the online test is not adequate documentation.\n• Family Team Meetings- Per FOM 722-06B (Page 10) If a parent/caregiver\ndeclines to attend or participate in the pre-meeting discussion or FTM, the\nmeeting must proceed with other participants in attendance. If no other\nparticipants are identified, the caseworker and supervisor must proceed with\na case conference to assess and plan for the child’s safety, permanency, and\nwell-being. The caseworker must make active efforts to engage the parent or\ncaregiver in the FTM process until case closure. Engagement efforts and a\nparent’s denial of participation must be documented in the case service plan.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows.\nA CAP, approved 4/17/23, was the result of the 4/3/23 renewal evaluation. During\nthe 2023 review the agency had violations regarding references in personnel files,\nborrowed bed agency agreement, and family team meetings (FTM). The agency\nreported successful implementation of the prior CAP. During the current review the\nagency was found to show improvement in all areas of the CAP. However, a\nrepeat violation was determined regarding FTMs. A new CAP will be developed to\naddress this repeat violation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) was reviewed and discussed on-site.\nThe CAA indicated strategies were implemented to improve compliance from the\n4",
    "2023 review. Strategies included increased timeframes to schedule FTMs,\ncalendar reminders, additional supervisory oversight, implementation of trackers,\nand staff training. The CAA indicated the agency has improved in many areas.\nHowever, they’ve found that parent contacts are sometimes challenging as the\nparents are not always willing to engage with agency staff. The lack of willingness\nto engage contributed to FTMs not being completed timely.\nThe CAA identified two disrupted placements for one youth this year. The\nplacement changes were due to caregiver request because of the youth’s\nincreased behavioral challenges. The agency increased worker and supervisor\ncontacts and support and held FTMs in order to preserve the placement.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. Both staff reported they really enjoy their jobs\nand have excellent supervisors. Both staff stated they did not have any concerns\nor suggestions for improvements within the agency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same office building as previous years.\nThe office has secure storage for confidential information. There is adequate\nspace for staff and clients to conduct business and hold visitation.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_____________March 8, 2024_________________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 11, 2024\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
