    "The agency’s renewal evaluation was completed on 6/11/2024, with a CAP\napproved on 7/25/24. The CAP addressed violations regarding reevaluation\nrecommendations, borrowed home procedures, and special evaluation interviews.\nThe agency reported successful implementation of the CAP. There were no repeat\nviolations found during the current review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) Assessment dated 5/29/25 was reviewed and\ndiscussed. The CA reported that during this review period, the agency went\nthrough a restructuring. This included transition of some staff to different positions\nor locations and some layoffs. The CA indicated these changes impacted\ntimeliness of some work. However, the agency maintained high key-performance\nindicator (KPI) percentages. The CA reported that in addition to the challenges of\nrestructuring and staff changes, the agency also had systemic struggles with\ntimely medical and dental exams in their area, due to limited provider ability. The\nCA indicated that due to the low number of cases, just one late exam could deeply\nimpact their KPI percentage. The CA stated that another area of opportunity is\nservice plan approval timeliness. Due to the shift in positions and supervisors,\nreport revisions were delayed at times, leading to limited time for the supervisor to\napprove the report.\nThe CA stated the agency was able to successfully implement the CAP from the\n2024 review through increased tracking, use of calendar reminders, use of\nprotected time for staff, and thorough training with staff. The agency also moved to\na new quality process called IMPACT. It is anticipated this process will improve\nreview of data and implementation of processes. Regarding disrupted and\nunplanned moves, the CA reported one placement that changed unexpectedly\nThe youth had extremely escalated behaviors, including threats to harm the foster\nparents. The youth was taken to the hospital for evaluation, then placed with fictive\nkin.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided the 2025 budget and 2023 financial audit. The 2024 financial\naudit is in progress. No financial concerns were noted.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed onsite. Both staff were caseworkers; one had been\nwith the agency for four years, and the other for one year. Both staff\nacknowledged some challenges with the reconfiguration of the agency. Staff\nindicated having a new supervisor was an adjustment, but the transition went well.\nThey described the supervisor as always available, supportive, knowledgeable,\nand able to get timely answers to any questions. Staff reported there had been\nsome uncertainty initially with the agency changes. However, they felt that things\nwere still going well, and they did not have any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\n5",
    "The agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2024 review. The\noffice is in a large building in downtown Jackson. There is plenty of office and\nmeeting space for staff. There is visitation space available for families. The agency\nhad secure, locked, storage for confidential documents.\nVII. AGENCY ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and a corrective action plan is required.\n_ _____________June 24, 2025________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 24, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
