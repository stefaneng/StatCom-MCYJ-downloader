    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth C alleged that Staff 1 choked him on 5/4/24.\nInvestigation Documents reviewed:\nAn incident report by Staff 1 dated 5/4/24 indicated Youth C ran\nup to Staff 1 and “head pumped” him. Staff 1 told him to stop.\nYouth C kicked, balled up his fist and hit Staff 1 in his face and\nbruised Staff 1’s arm. “I had to grab him by his shoulders to pry\nhim away from me because he was kicking me and digging his\nfingernails in my arm. My arm is bleeding, and my jaw is hurting.\nThe bottom of my lip on the inside is swollen. I walked away after\nYouth C let me go.”\nAn incident report by Staff 2 dated 5/4/24 indicated Youth C\nstarted swinging on Staff 1. Staff 1 grabbed Youth C’s arms to\nstop him from attacking him. Youth C became more upset and\nkicked and punched more. Staff 1 grabbed his arms again to\nprotect himself from Youth C assaulting him.\nInterviews:\nI notified Residential Director of the allegation. She said Staff 1\nallegedly choked Youth C and was placed on administrative leave\npending the outcome of the investigation.\nI interviewed Complainant via phone. She said she was not at\nthe facility when Youth C alleged Staff 1 choked him.\nI notified Youth C’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation\nassignment. He had no additional licensing concerns.\nI arrived at the facility on 5/7/24 to interview Youth C. Youth C\nwas not there and had been transported to a hospital by police for\n2",
    "a psychiatric assessment. Later that day, Government Worker\narrived at the facility to interview Youth C and he refused to talk to\nher. Government Worker observed no visible marks on his neck\narea.\nI arrived at the facility to interview Youth C again on 5/8/24. Youth\nC was present but refused to be interviewed.\nGovernment Worker and I arrived at the facility again on 5/9/24 to\ninterview Youth C, but he was not there and had been transported\nto the hospital again for another psychiatric assessment.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker on 5/9/24.\nHe has worked at the facility for one month. Staff 2 recalled the\nmorning of 5/4/24. As he entered the big playroom, he said Youth\nC was sitting on a couch swinging at Staff 1 who was standing\nnearby. “I thought they were playing until Staff 1 grabbed his arm\nto stop him from swinging and kicking. Youth C stood and\nsquared up with Staff 1. They moved together into the small\ndining room. I could not see Staff 1’s hands. I saw Youth C drop\nor fall to the floor on his own. He was screaming and crying\nyelling ‘I can’t breathe’ but nobody was touching him. Staff 1 tried\nto help Youth C up.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker on 5/9/24.\nHe has worked at the facility for one year. Staff 1 was last trained\nin CPI in May 2023. On the morning of 5/4/24 Staff 1 said Youth C\nran up to him and chest bumped him. Then Youth C headbutted\nhim, hitting Staff 1’s head. “at first I thought he was playing but\nthen he went into a rage. He swung at me. I tried to get him off of\nme. He hit me in my lip, kicked me in between my legs, dug his\nnails into my arm and hit me in my jaw. While trying to pull him\naway, I realized my hands were placed on the side of his neck or\nshoulder and let go completely. That’s when Youth C fell and\nscreamed, ‘He’s choking me. He’s choking me.’” Staff 1 did not\nescort Youth C from one room to another. He said it was the\nmomentum of him moving to block Youth C’s blows that caused\nthem both to move together into the dining room.\nAfter the incident Youth C had no marks or bruises. However,\nStaff 1 said he was injured and went to the emergency room.\n“When Youth K kicked me between my legs, it was pretty painful.\nI went to the doctor because he dug his nails in my arm. I picked\nhis fingernails out of my skin.” Small, curved scars were observed\non Staff 1’s left forearm.\n3",
    "I interviewed Youth P jointly with Government Worker at school\non 5/9/24. He said he saw Youth C hitting Staff 1. “Staff 1 was\ntelling him to ‘chill out’ and tried to get Youth C off of him. Youth C\nkept hitting him. Staff 1 pushed Youth C into a wall in the small\ndining room. I heard he cut Staff 1’s arm with his nails. Youth C\nclaimed Staff 1 choked him, but Staff 1 didn’t.”\nI interviewed Youth D jointly with Government Worker at school\non 5/9/24. He saw Youth C “acting up” and hitting Staff 1 but said\nthat was none of his business. Youth D said nothing more than,\n“Staff 1 didn’t do anything wrong. Staff 1 was scratched and\nbleeding. Youth C did not get hurt.”\nVideo:\nVideo footage shows Youth C leaning back on a sofa with Staff 1\nbending over him holding his arms for 12 seconds. Staff 1\nreleases, Youth C stands and kicks Staff 1’s left leg while\nswinging at him. Staff 2 is present and does not assist Staff 1 to\nexecute a proper physical restraint. Youth C continues swinging\nwhile Staff 1 blocks the blows by extending his arms. Youth C\nbacks away, Staff 1 approaches him and grabs his shirt at the\nshoulder while Youth C pulls away. From Youth C’s right side,\nStaff 1 places his left hand at the top of the youth’s shoulder and\nslides it up to the back of his neck. Staff 1’s right hand is holding\nor touching the top front of Youth C’s body, but the specific\nplacement of his hand is out of view. Staff 1 appears to move\nYouth C into the dining room with both of his hands on Youth C’s\nneck. At one point, Youth C’s neck and upper body tilt backward\nas if he was pulling away or being pulled back. Staff 1 moves his\nhands from Youth C’s neck down his shoulders to his elbows.\nStaff 1 releases his right hand and holds Youth C at the top of his\nshoulder with his left hand. Youth C drops to the floor and sits.\nStaff 1 fully releases, and Youth C continues to swat at Staff 1\nfrom the floor. Staff 1 did not push Youth C into the wall as Youth\nP indicated.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis Staff 1 held Youth C’s arms while Youth C was leaning back on\nthe sofa. Staff 1 approached Youth C as he backed away placing\nhis hand on his upper back then moving it to the back of Youth C’s\nneck. Staff 1 turned Youth C and moved him to another room by\nthe back and sides youth’s neck and shoulders. While he did\nutilize improper techniques to escort Youth C, it did not appear\nStaff 1 “choked” or applied pressure to the front of Youth C’s neck.\n4",
    "Conclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Behavior management\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4157\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures that describe the institution’s behavior management\nsystem. The policies and procedures shall be reviewed annually\nand updated as needed. These shall be available to all residents,\ntheir families, and referring agencies.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 physically restrained and escorted Youth C from one room\nto another utilizing improper techniques.\nInvestigation Document reviewed:\nI reviewed the agency’s CPI manual with the approved moves\ntrained at the facility. There are no approved single-person\nescorts or restraints.\nVideo:\nVideo footage shows Staff 1 bending over Youth C holding his\narms for 12 seconds. Youth C stands and kicks and swings at\nStaff 1. Staff 2 is present and does not assist Staff 1 to execute a\nproper physical restraint. As Youth C backs away, Staff 1\napproaches him and grabs his shirt at the shoulder. Staff 1 moves\nYouth C to another room with both of his hands on the back of\nYouth C’s neck, and gradually releases.\nInterview:\nI spoke with Residential Director on 5/16/24 and she informed\nme the staff person who did not assist, Staff 2, resigned.\nAnalysis After Youth C kicked and swung at him, Staff 1 utilized\nunapproved restraint techniques to restrict Youth C’s movements.\nCONSULTATION\nSinglehandedly holding Youth C’s arms, approaching him as he\nbacked away, grabbing his shirt and moving him by the back of his\nneck are not approved restraint techniques. Once Youth C\nbecame combative, emergency physical restraint was warranted,\nand Staff 2 should have assisted Staff 1 in executing a proper\nrestraint.\n5",
    "Conclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJune 13, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 13, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n6"
