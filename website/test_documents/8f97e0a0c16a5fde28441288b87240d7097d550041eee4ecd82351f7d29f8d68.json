Freedom from communicable\ntuberculosis shall be verified within the 1-year period before\nemployment and shall be verified every 1 year after the last\nverification or prior to the expiration of the current verification.\nTwenty of twenty-two new employee files reviewed did not have documentation of\nthe tuberculosis screening completed prior to their documented hire date. Four of\nfive long term employee files reviewed did not have documentation of the\ntuberculosis screening completed annually.\nR 400.155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions, initial treatment plan.\n(3) The initial treatment plan shall include all of the following:\n(c) Treatment goals to remedy the problems of the resident\nand family, and time frames for achieving the goals.\n4",
    "Two of three open case files reviewed that contained Initial Treatment Plans did not\nhave the required specific aspects of the treatment goals documented in the plan.\nThis involved one case file (ITP) having an identified domain documented as a need,\nbut the summary did not support this finding and one case file (ITP) identified\nanother domain as a strength, but also listed it as a goal.\nR 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions, initial treatment plan.\n(3) The initial treatment plan shall include all of the following:\n(f) Staff techniques for achieving the resident’s treatment\ngoals, including a specific behavior management plan. The plan\nshall be designed to minimize seclusion and restraint and\ninclude a continuum of responses to problem behaviors.\nTwo of three open case files reviewed that contained Initial Treatment Plans did not\nhave the required staff techniques for achieving the resident’s treatment goals\ndocumented in either plan.\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan.\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional care, all of\nthe following information shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n(f) The name and official title of the person to whom the\nresident was discharged.\nOne of two discharged case files reviewed did not have documentation of the name\nand official title of the person the youth was discharged to.\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan.\n(2) For an unplanned discharge, an institution shall provide a\nbrief summary or other documentation of the circumstances\nsurrounding the discharge.\nOne of two discharged case files reviewed did not have the required brief summary\nof the reasons for the unplanned discharge.

This facility is non-contracted with Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices, therefore, MDHHS Policy/MDHHS contract are not applicable.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Develop the Resident Treatment Plans/Discharge Plan to cover all the\nlicensing requirements.\n Place all required case documentation in the same file.\n5",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n Development of an electronic filing system.\n Organize filing system to reflect the needs of the governing bodies of the\nfacility such as accreditation, contract, and licensing.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility was not required to submit any corrective action plans during this review\nperiod.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nThis report documents the facility’s growth from the original license in November 2021\nand first acceptance of youth in late December 2021. The facility is providing services\nfor youth within a Federal contact. The report also documents the facility’s lack of\ncompliance with their personnel files and appropriate completion of treatment plans\nas discovered during this inspection. The Chief Administrator outlines the action steps\nplanned to address these issues and it involves the following: The Program Director\nand Chief Administrator will obtain all missing items from the personnel files and\ndevelop a checklist to ensure all requirements are completed at time of hire. All\npersonnel files will be audited within 30-days of hire to ensure all items are present.\nThe Program Director or designee will review the Treatment Plan requirements with\nall social service staff and monitor due dates for each Treatment Plan. Overall, the\nAdministration will develop a master, merged checklist of required Federal and State\ndocuments for each youth file. This master list will be used for continuous monitoring\nfor compliance. This report outlines the challenges the facility has had with the youth\nentering the program. There has been several contacts with Law Enforcement over\nsome of the youth’s behaviors. The facility is in the progress of adjusting to\nappropriately handle these situations while still providing the services needed by the\nyouth. This report addresses the single unplanned discharge, and it is documented\nthat the youth who went AWOL has safety return to his mother’s home.\nInterviews:\nStaff were interviewed and all presented with a strong desire to provide the principles\nof best practice to the youth in their care. The staff also indicated a strong belief of\nsupport by the Administration. The youth interviewed reported feeling safe and having\ntheir needs met at the facility. Although, the newest youth suggested a dislike of the\nrules and a mistrust of the system they also reported feeling safe while at the facility.\nAll youth also shared that staff are constantly monitoring them.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n6",
