    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe facility submitted 2 corrective action plans (CPA) during this reporting period.\nThe first CAP was in response to the renewal inspection that took place last year.\nThis required the facility to develop a CAP for rules 4113 (Central Registry Checks),\n4114 (Tuberculosis Screening), 4130 (Privacy and Confidentiality, and 4128 (Initial\nStaff orientation and training). Regarding rule 4114 the facility retrained\nadministration staff on the need to follow policy and ensure staff have a copy of their\nTB testing prior to hire. This issue was not found during this inspection. Regarding\nrule 4113 the new process of the state checking for long standing employees helped\nand the facility is now doing regular compliance checks on the personal files for this\nissue which appears to be successful since this was not an issue during this\ninspection. Regarding rule 4130 the facility provided a copy of the changed policy\nthat does not permit video recording of any type. This policy was shared with staff\nand again no violation was found during this inspection. Regarding rule 4128 the staff\nwere all trained on the required documentation needs and need to complete this\ndocumentation in a timely manner. Again, this issue was not found during this\ninspection. The second CAP submitted involved a special investigation\n2024SIC0001475 which had two identified action steps. The first action step involved\nan updated policy and procedure for discharges and emergency discharges. All staff\nwere to be trained on the changes which involved staff remaining present if a youth\nis taken to the hospital or other medical care and supervision of youth is not to end\nuntil a documented transfer has been completed. This was verified during quarterly\nunannounced visits and the facility was appropriate in their follow through. The\nsecond action step involves the new discharge policy and procedure being added to\nthe monthly policy reviews and updates. Staff will also review the new\npolicy/procedure every 6-months at the team meeting. This was verified during\nquarterly unannounced visits and the facility was appropriate in their follow through.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\n3",
    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator outlines the efforts made to bring the facility into\ncompliance involving the single special investigation 2024SIC0001475 that\noccurred during this reporting period. The Chief Administrator also outlines the\nefforts to bring the facility into compliance with the violations found during the\nannual renewal licensing inspection for 2023. None of the violations found in that\ninspection were discovered during this interim inspection suggesting the facility was\nsuccessful in their compliance efforts. The Chief Administrator documents the Key\nperformance indicators (KPI) involved securing quality licensed clinical staff and the\nfacility was able to accomplish this task. Training was provided for the new clinical\nstaff to ensure they were completing their tasks per licensing/contract\nrequirements. The Chief Administrator documented there was one unplanned\ndischarge during this reporting period when a youth chose to leave the facility and\nlive on his own. The youth was within a couple of months of 18-years-old and\nwanted to start independent living without waiting. This was not identified as a\nsystemic trend, and the facility made numerous efforts to help the youth make the\nchoice to wait until the foster care worker could set up an appropriate process.\nRegarding policy changes that still need to be improved, the Chief Administrator\ndocumented the program statement has been changed to match what the state\ncontract is requiring.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported positive attitudes and receiving significant training to\nenhance their ability to work and provide best practice to the youth in the program.\nThe staff understood the responsibility for supervision and believed administration\nare supportive of their efforts. Staff have knowledge of the youth’s treatment plans\nand their interventions when working with the youth.\nYouth were interviewed with only one youth having partial verbal ability. The youth\nreported doing well and being taken care of. The interactions with staff were very\nappropriate and the youth’s needs were cared for.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThis is a two-story facility and is well maintained and clean. The facility is in\nexcellent condition and well-furnished in all aspects. There is a significant amount\nof frozen, fresh, and dry foods available for the youth and the menu is posted for\nthe youth to view. All plumbing is in working order and all cleaning supplies are\nlocked as required. Medication is also locked, and the facility is conducting\nemergency drills as required. The bed check logs are also in compliance. All\nrequired postings are in place and the youth’s files are stored appropriately.\n4",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n1/28/2025\n_____________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n1/30/2025\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
