    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nSection (1) An agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nDescription parenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the following:\n(a) A plan of visitation for each child in foster care consistent\nwith the child’s service plans, as required by R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420 to assure the safety and well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Respondent mother has not been offered parenting time with two\nof her children who are in care for approximately 5 weeks.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nChief Administrator was interviewed via Teams on 5/2/2023.\nShe reported Parent A has always been offered parenting time,\nbut she has not always participated due to lack of confirming visits\nor refusing to visit at the agency.\nParent A/Complainant was interviewed by phone on 4/28/2023.\nShe reported she hasn’t had a visit with her children, Youth A &\nYouth B, for 5 weeks. She stated visits were previously occurring\nat her home until a safety plan was put into place for Youth B,\nrequiring a change in location. Parent A stated Foster Care\nWorker has not given her a reason why Youth B’s visits can’t\noccur at her home. Parent A has two other children in foster care\nthrough a different private agency and those children continue to\nhave twice per week visits in Parent A’s home. Parent A stated\nthere are reasons why Youth B’s visits can’t always occur, such as\nhis current hospitalization, so Youth A’s visits are the visits she’s\nconcerned about. She stated Foster Care Worker has offered her\nvisits at the agency, but Parent A’s car isn’t working, so she\ncannot get to the office. She stated Foster Care Worker did offer\nher bus passes, but there is no bus that transports from her home\nlocation to the office. Parent A added Foster Care Worker offers\nher visits during times when Parent A works.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via Teams on 5/2/2023.\nShe reported that a separate private agency has full family\nresponsibility for Parent A’s case and also has case management\nresponsibility of two of Parent A’s children. Foster Care Supervisor\nis responsible for supervising the cases of Youth A & Youth B.\nPrior to March of 2023, the two agencies were coordinating visits\nwith all children. In March, the other agency moved the visits to\nthe home of Parent A. Youth A & Youth B’s visits were also moved\nto Parent A’s home at that time. Two visits occurred in Parent A’s\nhome before it was decided that Youth A and Youth B could no\n2",
    "longer visit in the home due to concerns with Youth B’s behavior.\nAdditionally, there is a pending trial for termination of Parent A’s\nrights, so the agency staff determined it could be traumatizing to\nthe youth to have visitation in Parent A’s home. Foster Care\nSupervisor reported it was verbally ordered at court yesterday,\n5/1/2023, that visits were to be supervised at the agency office.\nDirector was interviewed via Teams on 5/2/2023. She reported\nvisits in Parent A’s home have been determined to be a safety risk\nbased on the pending termination hearing and the potential for\nParent A to present a safety risk to the agency staff or children.\nDirector reported the visits that did take place in Parent A’s home\ndid not go well due to Youth B being a flight risk and having a\nhistory of elopement. Director reported it was determined by\nagency staff it would be best to hold the visits in a controlled\nenvironment, so the visits between Parent A, Youth A, and Youth\nB were moved to the agency office. Director stated Parent A\nhasn’t seen the youths in 4 weeks because she has either failed to\nconfirm her scheduled visits or refuses to visit at the office.\nDirector reported Parent A has not been denied visits and is\nalways offered visits on Thursday at the agency office with Youth\nA. Youth B has been hospitalized for mental health concerns since\n4/20/2023 and Parent A can and has participated in visits with him\nat the hospital. Director stated Parent A has had a car and has\nbeen able to get rides from family members when needed.\nDirector reported Parent A’s work schedule has changes several\ntimes throughout the case and agency staff have worked with her\nto change the times of visits to accommodate her schedule.\nDirector reported Parent A has not had an in person visit with\nYouth A since 3/23/2023 due to Parent A failing to confirm her\nvisits or wanting visits to occur at her home; however, she had a\nvideo with Youth A on her birthday 4/8/2023, which was a\nSaturday, at Parent A’s request. Parent A visited Youth B in the\nhospital, where Youth B is currently placed on 4/23/2023 and\n4/28/2023. Parent A also had a brief visit with Youth A via video\nfollowing Youth A’s psychological evaluation. Director reported\nparenting time is scheduled this coming Thursday with Youth A.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed vis Teams on 5/2/2023. She\nreported Parent A did have a working car and has utilized family\nmembers for rides to her visits, when needed. Foster Care Worker\ndid offer Parent A bus passes in order for her to get to the visits,\nbut Parent A refused them without explanation. Foster Care\nWorker stated she believed there was a bus route from Parent A’s\nhome to the office and Parent A has not told her there is not;\n3",
    "however, she will look into the route. Foster Care Worker reported\nthe visits are scheduled to accommodate the youths’ school\nschedule as well as Parent A’s work schedule and Parent A\ncontacted her this week to let her know her work schedule had\nchanged after which the visit times were changed. Foster Care\nWorker reported the court has now ordered visits to be supervised\nat the agency office.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nCase Contacts in MiSACWIS:\n• 3/17/2023 – Visit with Youth A & Youth B at Parent A’s\nhome.

These plans should\nbe updated between service plans, if needed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nSection (1) An agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nDescription parenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the following:\n(d) Provisions for visits between siblings who are not placed\ntogether except when there is a court determination that visits are\ndetrimental to either child.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The youths are not being provided sibling visitation.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nParent A/Complainant was interviewed by phone on 4/28/2023.\nShe reported Youth A and Youth B have not had visits with their\nsiblings who are also in foster care for approximately five weeks.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via Teams on 5/2/2023.\nFoster Care Worker reported no sibling visits occurred in April.\nShe stated sibling visits were occurring during parenting times, but\nsince the visit locations were changed for the youths, they have\nnot occurred. She stated the worker for Youth A & Youth B’s\nsiblings stated the sibling visits would continue to occur in Parent\nA’s home, despite Foster Care Worker no longer permitting\nvisitation for Youth A & Youth B in Parent A’s home. Foster Care\nWorker has been attempting coordinate a sibling visit at a different\nlocation; however, the siblings’ worker continues to want the\nsibling visits to occur in Parent A’s home.\n5",
    "Foster Care Supervisor was interviewed via Teams on 5/2/2023.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated the change in visitation location as\nwell as sibling visits were discussed during a 4/3/2023 Family\nTeam Meeting. During that meeting, the worker for Youth A &\nYouth B’s siblings wanted the sibling visits to continue at Parent\nA’s home. Foster Care Supervisor reported reaching out to the\nother agency multiple time, including yesterday, to try to\ncoordinate sibling visits at a different location. She reported she\nwill continue to work with that agency to ensure sibling visits\noccur.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nCase Contacts in MiSACWIS:\n• 3/9/2023 Sibling Visit at Parent A’s home is last sibling visit\ndocumented.\nFamily Team Meeting documents in MiSACWIS:\n• 4/3/2023 worker for Youth A & Youth B’s siblings stated\nvisits with those siblings would continue to occur in Parent\nA’s home and sibling visits could occur there.\nVisitation Plan in MiSACWIS:\n• Supervised, 2 hours weekly with Parent A at a relative’s\nhome.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as they do have provisions for\nsibling visits and are making attempts to resolve the location\nissues that have prevented the sibling visits.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",

    "summary": "The report details an investigation into allegations that a parent was denied parenting time and that sibling visits were not occurring for two children in foster care. The investigation found that the agency consistently offered weekly visits at its office, but the parent often failed to confirm or refused to attend because she preferred visits at her home. A safety concern and a court order dictated the change in location from the parent's home to the agency. Sibling visits were hindered because the other agency involved insisted they occur at the parent's home, which was now deemed inappropriate. The agency was found in compliance with all rules; the evidence suggests the parent's own actions and a coordination issue with another agency were primary causes for the lack of in-person visits.",
