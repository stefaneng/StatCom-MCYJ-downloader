EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nAND\n7",
    "The agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The first was in response to the Renewal\nInspection. The second was in response to Special Investigation 2020C223011\nwhere a complaint was received stating the agency changed placement of a youth\nwithout following policy requirements. The agency was found in non-compliance for\nR 400.12405 Change of Placement as the agency informed the foster mother via\ntelephone of the planned placement change, and had the foster mother sign the\nNotification of Move (DHS-30). However, the agency was not in compliance as they\ndid not provide the foster parent with a written notice as required. The agency\ndeveloped a corrective action plan that was appropriate and implemented as verified\nwith a random review of case files during this audit.\nInterviews were completed with staff during the inspection. All staff reported an\nincrease in confidence, structure, and guidance by administration during this period\nunder review. A new Program Manager was hired, promoting within the agency that\nlead to consistency. During interviews with licensing, adoption, and foster care staff\nthey all reported good communication and understanding of job requirements. Staff\nreported the agency communicates consistently with policy changes and provides\nample opportunities for growth and training.\nVII. DCWL FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nSafety Alert #1\nConcern: The basement has a sliding glass door that leads to the pond located\nbehind the home. There is no type of alarm on the door.\nResolution: Licensing staff verified on 2/17/2020 a lock on the door leading down to\nthe basement and the key is located out of reach of the children and only the\ncaregivers know where it is located. Also, bells are located on the door handle to\nsignal to caregivers in the event that the children were trying to access the\nbasement. Bells continued to be located on the other door leading to the outside.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\nJuly 9, 2020\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\n8",
