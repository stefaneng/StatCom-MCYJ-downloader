EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were one substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThis incident related to allegations that the foster mother, after arriving at the foster\nchild’s school due to the child having behavior concerns, spat in the child’s face,\nslapped him, and placed her foot on his stomach.

The foster children\nwere removed from the foster home; and revocation of the family’s foster home\nlicense was recommended.\nThe agency adhered to all departmental standards and timeframes related to this\nspecial evaluation.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThis incident related to allegations that the foster mother grabbed her five-year-old\nfoster child by the hair and pushed his head aggressively and cursed him, after the\nchild pulled her hair.

A corrective action plan\nwas completed with the foster parents. The corrective action plan included the\nfoster parents re-reviewing the agency’s foster parent agency agreement, behavior\nmanagement policy and completing a behavior management questionnaire.",
    "The agency adhered to all departmental standards and timeframes related to this\nspecial evaluation, except R400.12327 and MCL 722.120(3) for which the agency\nreceived a citation.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period. This corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024 Interim\ninspection completed on 9/3/2024; and CAP approve 11/27/2024. In that 2024\ninspection, the agency received 18 rule citations of which 10 were repeat\nviolations for the reporting period (7 specifically from 2023). During this 2025\ninspection, 17 rule violations were established; and 5 are repeat rule violations\nfrom 2024.\nThe agency implemented its 2024 corrective action plan and made progress with it\nas demonstrated by the lowered number of repeat citations. Conversely, the\nnumber of individual cases cited per rule increased by 2 in 3 of the 5 rules cited;\nand decreased by 5 and 1 respectively related to the other 2 rules cited. The\nagency reported it struggles with creating a CAP every year, because it is hard to\ndetermine if the action steps put in place will be effective in bringing about the\nchange it wants. The agency reported the CAP it developed in 2024 had some\ngood goals and action steps, but it also had some that did not bring about\nimprovement, once they started to implement them. Notwithstanding this\nrealization, the agency reported it will continue to review and work on enhanced\nmethods to bring about rule compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 8/14/2025. The chief\nadministrator (CA) reported on the prior year's violations and the action steps it put\nin place to achieve compliance. The CA also indicated systematic factors that\nimpacted rule compliance, such as child welfare worker burnout, mental health\nchallenges for children being served, and those factors’ impact on worker\nlongevity in foster care positions; and the Department of Child Welfare Licensing\n(DCWL) rules and the Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) policies\n(such as KPIs-key performance indicators) not always aligning. Therein with the\nlatter, the agency may experience compliance related to KPIs (i.e. achieving 80%\nor higher on a standard), while being in noncompliance related to DCWL rules if\none case is cited (/because 100% isn’t achieved). The agency reported it shall\ncontinue to advocate for DCWL to follow KPI requirements. As mentioned above,\nthe agency reported that developing corrective action plans has been a struggle;\nthey also report they will continue to put action steps in place, and will work with\nstaff around those action steps in an effort to increase and maintain rule\ncompliance, The agency also reported it was helpful to have CAP follow-ups\nduring the last 6 months to ensure steps were being followed; and that they\nexpected less rule violations as a result of the CAP.\nThe agency further reported that despite continued staff retention challenges in\nsome position areas; they are trying to address the mental health and stress",
    "aspect on workers by providing aid and compensating workers in way that they\ncan. The agency identified the main strengths of the agency’s as its stability of\nmanagerial staff, and its development of monitoring and tracking mechanisms to\nassist around due dates. Areas for improvement identified was around the new\nlicensing supervisor getting acclimated to her role, and adoption related tasks\naround assessment timeframes.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a copy of its 2024/2025 annual budget; and 9/30/2024,\nindependent financial audit. A review of these documents did not show any areas\nof concern.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, program director, licensing\nsupervisor, and foster care supervisors during the entrance conference, I\ninterviewed two foster care workers and an adoption worker. The staff interviewed\nreported being appreciative of the size of the agency, in that its smallness offers a\nfamily-like aspect, and there is team encouragement and support. Areas for\nimprovement centered on the agency acquiring more staff to help reduce case\nactivities; and continued improved communication with managers.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nDuring a walkthrough of the facility no concerns were revealed. The agency’s\nrecords are securely stored, and there appears to be sufficient equipment for staff.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nTwo safety alerts were identified:\nSafety Alert #1 received 6/6/2025: The child stated when he gets in trouble. The\nfoster parent spanks him with an open hand on his butt.\nResolution: The agency opened a separate evaluation related to the allegation; and\neffective 6/6/2024 established a safety plan with the foster parent that she will not\nuse physical discipline techniques. The foster parent will use removal of privileges,\nsuch as restriction of television.\nSafety Alert # 2 received 6/24/2025: The window screens in the children’s bedrooms\nare missing. The missing screens do not allow a fan to be placed in the windows;\nand due to the extreme heat the two boys are not able to sleep in their bedroom.\nResolution: On 6/27/2025 the agency reported the window screens were delivered\nand installed by the caregivers. Two screens were installed in each of the children's\nbedrooms; and the children are able to safely and comfortably sleep in the bedrooms.\nThe agency provided photos showing the window screens installed, and one photo\nshowing a window fan unit installed that is able to be utilized to keep the room cooler.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nAugust 30, 2025\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 2, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager"
