    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Technical Assistance was not requested or required.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Consultation was not requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with this individual CAP is as follows:The one\nCAP submitted was in response to the 2023 renewal inspection completed on\n3/20/2023 and the CAP was approved on 3/30/2023. The agency was cited for 2\nviolations, 1 of which was repeated this year. The repeated violation (722-08D –\nPATP signatures) increased from 8 of 22 PATP’s in violation in 2023 to 12 of 27\nPATP’s in violation in 2024 indicating additional corrective action planning is\nneeded. The agency will need to establish additional corrective action planning for\nthe repeated violation to ensure a reduction of this violation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) was discussed on site 4/12/2024 with\nthe Chief Administrator. The Chief Administrator (CA) reported the agency’s\nbarriers continued within the agency such as turnover of staff, worker and\nsupervisor oversight and the lack of effective new staff training. She identified\nsystemic barriers and factors that impact compliance outside of the agency control\nare MiSACWIS errors, varying interpretation of rule and policy from county to\ncounty, altering regulations, timeframes, and policies, even when they do not align\nwith the written policy and unrealistic timeframes and workload for current\npositions.\nThe CA reported that MiSACWIS errors, though less than in previous years, do\nplay a factor in repeated non-compliance. The CA said the system unfortunately",
    "is not fluid and adaptable to differing situations. Therefore, she feels agencies are\npenalized when cases do not fit within the parameters of MiSACWIS. An example\nis a parent in, in-patient treatment and the facility will not allow for monthly face to\nface visitation per their policies. MiSACWIS does not have a way to capture this\nwithout either penalizing the agency or penalizing the parent. The CA said the\nagency receives a lower percentage for worker/parent contact until the parent is\nreleased. Another MiSACWIS flaw and systemic barrier is when an agency takes\nresponsibility for a previously established case, any prior non compliances or\ntimeframes missed for that case are assume by the currently assigned agency.\nThe CA reported what is working and is a positive impact that occurred from the\nlast CAP activities were refresher of policies, procedures, and training\nopportunities. In addition, a training series stemmed from their agency CAP this\npast year, in which the foster care department hosted internal trainings on topics\nthat supervisors identified were barriers for front line staff. Trainings such as social\nwork contacts, relative home study, mileage, assessment writing, treatment plans,\nparent engagement, and court and testimony training.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency certified independent auditor’s report dated September 2022 and\n2023, and the agency annual financial report was reviewed. There were no\nfinancial concerns identified.\nStaff Interviews\nFour staff were interviewed onsite. Two staff interviewed were new and had\nrecently started working for the agency less than four months, the third staff has\nwork for the agency two years and the fourth staff interviewed has work for the\nagency twenty years. The staff stated there is great teamwork and collaboration\nat the agency and excellent guidance from administration when needed. Staff\nwere consistent in reporting their supervisors are very helpful, supportive and goes\nbeyond in assisting them when needed. The staff did not have any concerns\nabout the agency but indicated case aids to help transport for parenting time.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe office appears to have adequate space and equipment for the staff members\nto complete their required responsibilities. Physical CHRI and case files are all\nstored securely, preventing unauthorized access. No concerns were noted.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nSafety Alert #1: The caregivers have a bedroom in the basement and there is no\nmeans of egress.\nResolution: A discussion was held with the caregivers on 3/21/2024 via telephone\nby the case worker. The caregiver stated this room has not been used as a\n\"bedroom\" during their tenure as a licensed foster home. The caregiver admitted this\nwas previously used as a bedroom, two years prior to the family becoming licensed.\nThe room in the basement has remained a storage room since the caregiver’s\ndaughter moved out prior to licensure.\nPer the caregivers 3130 assessment dated 12/16/2021 and subsequent annual and\nrenewal evaluations the \"bedroom in the basement” has never been listed as a\nbedroom. There is a photo that shows boxes and storage items and does not depict\na room being used as a bedroom.\nDue to the rational provided, CCSEM did not initiate a special evaluation on the\ncaregivers, as there is no potential rule violation. A variance has not been requested\nof the caregivers, as they do not wish to use the space as a bedroom.\nShould the caregivers decide to utilize this room as a bedroom, CCSEM will ensure\nthat an egress window is installed prior to allowing anyone use it as a bedroom or\nrequest a variance from DCWL. Photo of the bedroom is attached to the safety\nalert.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n5/9/2024\n______________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n05/09/2024\n________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
