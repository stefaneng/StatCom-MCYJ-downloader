Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\n2",
    "and other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency was not adequately assessing the child’s\ndevelopmental needs; and did not obtain needed services for the\nchild related to his development. Nor did they timely secure the\nchild's Early On Assessment.\nInvestigation Complainant\nOn 7/21/2023 I interviewed the complainant, Guardian Ad Litem\n(GAL) X by telephone. GAL X confirmed the information in the\ncomplaint and reported the agency is not assessing Child A’s\ndevelopmental needs. She reported Child A was born positive for\nOpiates, so he may have special needs, and the agency should\nhave been monitoring and assessing for this, but the agency did\nnothing. She said, Child A is two and a half years old now and not\ntalking. GAL X reported Child A has had evaluations, but the\nagency was delayed in getting Child A assessed until GAL X got\ninvolved. GAL X reported she obtained a Court order for the\nagency to obtain an Early On assessment for Child A, and the\nagency did not follow up on it. GAL X reported that Child A’s\nmother, Parent D, who is only supposed to have supervised visits,\ntook him for the assessment. During that assessment Parent D\nhad Child A on her lap in a car and Parent D lied about what Child\nA was capable of doing related to his speech. GAL X reported\nknowing the information about Parent D with regards to what went\non with the Early On assessment because Early On reported it to\nthe foster parent, who reported the information to GAL X. GAL X\nreported the foster care worker and Child A’s grandmother,\nRelative C should have been at that assessment.\nGAL X reported had the agency been making regular home visits\nwith Relative C and Child A, they would have known Child X was\nnot speaking and would have a better understanding of his\ndevelopment.\nProgram Director 2\nOn 7/24/2023 I interviewed Program Director (PD) 2 onsite at the\nagency. PD 2 denied the allegations. She reported the agency\nmade continued home visits with Child A and Relative C during\nChild A’s placement with Relative C. She reported it is true that\nChild A’s speech appears delayed. She said, Child A talks, but\nperhaps should be talking more; but Child A isn’t in a “derelict”\nstate of delay, as GAL X had described him.\n3",
    "PD 2 reported Child A came under the agency’s care and\nsupervision when he was less than a month old. During home\nvisits with Child A and Relative C the agency was monitoring his\nplacement, development and progress. She said, Early On\nreferrals were completed for Child A during Child A’s placement\nwith Relative C. Wolverine made four Early On referrals. There\nwas ones in October 2021 and July 2022. With regards to those\ntwo referrals, Relative C would either report Child A’s Early On\nservices were going well or that she could not get ahold of Early\nOn. Wolverine made another Early On referral in October 2022,\nand there was one in July 2023.. PD 2 reported the October 2022\nEarly On referral was sourced out to the Chitter Chatter agency.\nWolverine did not receive the results from Chitter Chatter until\nFebruary 2023, for a reported evaluation in January 2023. The\nChitter Chatter January 2023 evaluation indicated Child A had a\nminor speech delay, but he did not qualify for services. PD 2\nreported at some point Wolverine questioned that Chitter Chatter\nevaluation. PD 2’s supervisor, Administrator 4 contacted a Chitter\nChatter Supervisor (CCS) about the evaluation and the CCS\nreported there were issues contacting Relative C. That Child A did\nqualify, but Relative C never followed through. Administrator 4\ninquired of the CCS why the Chitter Chatter report indicated Child\nA did not qualify; and the CCS reported not knowing why..\nAdministrator 4 also asked the CCS why Chitter Chatter had not\ncontacted Wolverine, since Wolverine made the referral. The CCS\nreported since Relative C and Parent D signed the consent form,\nChitter Chatter staff were contacting those individuals. CCS\nreported Child A qualifies for Early On part C services, and they\nwould provide services. PD 2 reported another Early On\nevaluation occurred on 7/25/2023 in Macomb County because\nChild A was replaced to that county. An Easter Seal appointment\nwas set for Child A for 8/15/2023.\nPD 2 was not aware of a Court ordered Early On assessment,\nbrought on by GAL X. She said the four Early On referrals\nWolverine completed for Child A were all initiated by Wolverine to\nassess Child A’s needs, not due to a Court order. She said there\nwas a Court order for an Autism evaluation, which the Court\nindicated Wolverine could obtained by way of a second opinion via\na health care provider other than Child A’s primary health care\nprovider. She reported a change in the health provider seemed to\nhave been what GAL X wanted. PD 2 admitted she tried to\nexplain to GAL X how continuity with a health care provider is\nimportant and that Wolverine tries to maintain this, and not have\ncaregivers changing doctors. PD2 said Wolverine did not object\n4",
    "to the second opinion, to the Autism assessment; and did in fact\nfollow through on it. Child A had a Sprout Evaluation on\n6/27/2023, which was to assess for Autism and other\ndevelopmental disorders. During that evaluation Child A was not\ndiagnosed with Autism but was diagnosed with an adjustment\ndisorder and mixed receptive language disorder. The Sprout\nassessment/evaluator recommended a structured play group, a\ncomprehensive speech and language evaluation; and that Child A\nmay also benefit from receiving an occupational therapy\nevaluation. Continued consultation with a pediatric neurologist\nwas also strongly recommended; and a list of possible Support\nCoordinators to assist with getting/completing the needed\nreferrals/ service linkage and accesses to the recommended\nevaluations were also indicated by Sprout. The agency is\nfollowing up with those recommendations.\nPD 2 provided me a copy of the Sprout Evaluation, which showed\nthe psychological evaluation and indicated diagnostic and\nrecommendation information reported by PD 2.\nFoster Care Worker 3\nOn 8/2/2023 I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) 3 onsite at\nthe agency. FCW 3 did not recall GAL X recommending that an\nEarly On referral be completed for Child A. FCW 3 reported for\nchildren in foster care they routinely complete an Early On referral\nfor the child. She completed three Early On referrals for Child A.\nShe was assigned to Child A’s case sometime in September of\n2021 and on 10/19/2021 she completed and Early On referral as\nthe new worker on the case. That referral was also completed\nbecause the agency wanted to know if Child A was developing on\ntarget as he appeared to be. The Early On assessment from that\nOctober 2021 referral did not occur due to communication issues\nbetween Relative C and the Early On agency. Relative C reported\nshe was calling Early On, and she was not receiving a call back.\nEarly On indicated Relative C was not following. After two to\nthree incidents like that, Early On dropped the referral.\nThereafter, with various reports by Child A’s pediatrician indicating\nhe was developing, Wolverine saw Child A as developing age\nappropriately.\nFCW 3 completed another Early On referral for Child A on\n10/14/2022, after a meeting with Relative C and Parent D, where\nboth were reporting concern with Child A’s speech. Child A was\ntwenty-two months old, and Child A was babbling more so, than\nusing words. FCW 3 also noticed that, thus the referral. FCW 3\nreported the October 2022 Early On referral generated the Chitter\n5",
    "Chatter assessment. FCW 3’s reporting of the circumstances of\nthat Chitter Chatter assessment were as described by PD 2 with\nChild A reportedly not qualifying, though he had; and the agency\nfollowing up on that matter.\nFCW 3’s third Early On referral was on 7/5/2023, because Child A\nmoved to Macomb County. The evaluation for this July 2023\nreferral was on 7/25/2023, with Child A qualifying for speech and\noccupational therapy for a speech delay and impulse control.\nFCW 3 reported a meeting with Early On is scheduled for\n8/4/2023 to discuss goals for Child A.\nDocument Review:\nChild A’s MiSACWIS case record, and file documents which\nshowed:\n• He is a temporary court ward, who was born positive to\nTHC and Hydromorphone.\n• He was placed under Wolverine’s care and supervision on\n1/14/2021.\n• He was placed in Relative C’s care on 1/13/2021 until\n6/6/2023.\n• Three Early On referrals completed for Child A dated\n1/21/2021(from Oakland County DHHS) 10/19/2021,\n1/21/2022, 10/13/2022, and 7/5/2023(from Wolverine).\n• Ages, & Stages Questionnaires completed by Child A’s\ncaregiver examining Child A’s development dated,\n3/5/2021(for two months of age);5/18/2021(for six months\nof age);1/19/2022(for 12 months of age) 3/9/2022 for (18\nmonths of age; 8/24/2022(for 24 months of age) and\n7/27/2023 for 30 months of age) showing Child A,\ndevelopment was being tracked.\n• Medical exams/well child examinations for Child A for four\nweeks, two months, six months, nine months, 12 months\n15, months and 18 months showing no concerns or\ncomplaint, or indicating well child. A 1/12/2023 well child\nexam for Child A’s two year old examination documented\na delay with Child A’s speech and that the child would be\nreferred to Early On.\n• A Chitter Chatter Integrative report dated 1/17/2022(should\nhave read 1/17/2023. The report indicated:\n✓ There was an initial Early On referral related to this\nassessment on 10/14/2022 due to concerns\nexpressed by Child A’s assigned case worker,\nrelative foster parent and birth mother.\n✓ Child A was 24 months old at the time of this\nassessment.\n6",
    "✓ The Evaluation took place via Zoom with Child A\nand Parent D. Relative C, his primary caregiver was\nalso present during the evaluation, with Parent D\nanswering the evaluation questions.\n✓ Child A was assessed to have no physical, social, or\nemotional delays.\n✓ Child A’s adaptive behavior was assessed to not be\nwithin normal limit; and he had a receptive language\ndelay.\n✓ Child A will qualify for Early-on Part C services.\nChitter Chatter will provide the family with\ninformation, literature, recommendations and\nactivities to use regarding Child A’s development.\n• A 7/25/2023 Macomb ISD Multidisciplinary Evaluation\nTeam Eligibility Recommendation report which indicated:\n✓ Child A was referred by Wayne County Early On and\nthe family’s pediatrician related to concerns\nregarding Child A’s speech and language\ndevelopment.\n✓ The Team recommended that Child A be determined\neligible for special education programs/services\nunder the category(ies) of Speech & Language\nImpairment.\n• A Sprout Evaluation Center, Psychological Evaluation\ndated 6/27/2023, which ruled out Autism and indicated a\nmixed receptive language delay; and findings and\nrecommendations as indicated by PD 2 during my interview\nwith her.\n• Consistent foster home/caregiver home visits by agency\nstaff for placement and parenting time visits.\nAnalysis Child A is currently a two- and half-year male. The agency was\nmonitoring the child’s development, completed at least three Early\nOn referrals for the child with that regard; and sought to obtain the\nservices which were ultimately recommended in the two\nevaluations that resulted from those Early On referrals.\nThe evidence does not support the allegations that the agency\nwas not assessing Child A needs, failed to obtain services for\nthose needs, or that they failed to obtain an Early On\nreferral/assessment for Child A. Nor does it support a lack of\nworkers not working directly with the child, their families, and other\nrelevant individuals related to the service plan.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\n7",
    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207- Staff Responsibilities.\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency is not adequately assessing for safety related to the\nchild’s health and behaviors, his birth parents, and his\npermanency plan.\nInvestigati Complainant\non On 7/21/2023 I interviewed the complainant, Guardian Ad Litem\n(GAL) X by telephone. GAL X confirmed the information in the\ncomplaint and reported the agency was not adequately assessing\nfor Child A’s safety for the following reasons: Parent D is\nsupposed to have supervised visits with Child A, but Relative C\nmay have been allowing Parent D to have the child for\nunsupervised visits. Parent D was the one who took Child A to an\nEarly On evaluation, when Relative C and the foster care worker\nshould have been there. Parent D and the Child A’s father, Parent\nE were reportedly in a Facebook post where the two of them were\nin bed with together with Child A. GAL X did not report whether\nshe saw this Facebook post or was told about it. There is\nconcern Parent D’s supervised visits are not really supervised.\nThe Facebook photo may be an indication of that.\nGAL X reported when Child A was replaced from Relative C’s\nhome he came to the new foster home with marijuana in his\nclothing. Additionally, the clothing he brought were stained and\nmany were too small. He was also extremely dirty to the point\nwhen the foster parent bathed him, the water was filthy. GAL X\nreported if the agency was making required monthly home visits to\nRelative C’s home they would have been aware that Relative C\nwas not providing for Child A’s need. The agency would have\nknown Relative C was allowing Child A to just watch television,\nwas not providing stimulation or adequate nutrition for him,\nbecause Relative C has allowed Child A to be an overweight child.\nGAL X also expressed concern the agency was or had been\nexploring Relative C an adoption plan for Child A, especially\ngiven all that was going on with Relative C.\n8",
    "GAL X also reported Child A has head banging behavior, which\nhas resulted in him having a boney ridge bruise on his forehead.\nGAL X said the agency told Child A’s new foster parent, that Child\nA had no behavior issues; the agency alleged Child A’s head\nbanging was a new behavior. GAL X said she did not see the\nbruise on Child A’s head, but it was reported by Foster Parent B\nand Foster Parent G. GAL X found it hard to believe the head\nbanging behavior was new. She reported Foster Parent G, who is\na doctor, termed Child A’s bruise as a “boney bruise” and reported\none would not get that type of bruise from recent behavior.\nGAL X further reported the agency is not adequately assessing\nParent E. She reported Parent E said he did not have a home,\nbut the agency is seeking to place Child A with Parent E who is\nliving with his girlfriend and or mother. Additionally, Parent E has\nextensive drugs related issues, and he is a convicted felon. GAL\nX said Parent E also has no relationship Child A; and Parent E\nonly became Child A’s legal father in April of 2023. She said the\nagency was seeking permanent custody, but not this plan with\nParent E, which the court is adopting. GAL X expressed concern\nthat Parent E could easily relapse. And given Parent E’s issues,\nGAL X question Parent E’s appropriateness as the permanency\nplan for Child A. GAL X is seeking or may seek to appeal the\nCourt’s order to place Child E with Parent E.\nProgram Director 2 & Foster Care Worker 3\nOn 7/24/2023 I interviewed Program Director (PD) 2 onsite at the\nagency regarding the allegations. I interviewed Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) 3 onsite at the agency on 8/2/2023. I also spoke\nwith FCW 3 about aspects of the allegations by telephone on\n8/8/2023.\nParent D’s supervised or unsupervised contact with Child A:\n• PD2 reported it is true that Parent D parenting time is\nsupervised, but the Court has allowed there to be a\ndesignee to supervisor those parenting visits; and Relative\nC is the person the Court allowed as the designee. PD 2\nsaid GAL X is aware to this; so PD 2 is not sure why GAL X\nmay have an issue with that now. With respect to the\nparenting times, PD 2 reported when Parent D’s visitations\nwere at the office, they could tell Parent D had spent a lot\nof time with Child A, but parenting times had and have\ngone well. PD 2 reported from what the agency knows,\nRelative C has been in the line of sight for Parent D’s\nsupervised parenting time with Child A. PD 2 reported\nwhen a concern is brought to their attention about a\n9",
    "possible lack of supervision by Relative C related to the\nparent/child parenting visitations, they can address it. Like\non 6/5/2023 when Parent D was outside with Child A\nplaying and the two were not in Relative C’s line of sight.\nPD 2 reported she reminded Relative C about Relative C’s\noversight responsibility. PD 2 said when they have known\nabout parenting supervision concerns or issues they have\nacted on them. They have advised GAL X of that; and that\nthey can only do something about issues the agency knows\nabout.\nPD 2 reported it was true that at one point, the plan had\nbeen for Relative C to adopt Child A, because the agency\nhad submitted a supplemental petition to terminate on\nParent D; and Parent E’s location was unknown. A plan of\nadoption by Relative C would have been the normal plan of\naction in that scenario, but GAL X was disgusted with that\nplan. PD 2 reported all of that was before Parent E came\non the scene; and before all the other information got\ndisclosed related to Relative C that resulted in Child A’s\nneed to be replaced. A latter act and move that Wolverine\nkept GAL X informed of step by step, and which the Foster\nCare Review Board (FCRB)agreed with.\nAs for Parent D and Parent E living together or having a\nFacebook post of the two parents in bed with Child A, PD 2\nreported the following: It appears from what FCW 3\nreported that the foster parent looked Parent D up on\nFacebook and saw the picture and reported it. The picture\ndid not appear to be a selfie, someone took the photo,\nwhich may have been from October of 2022. PD 2 did not\nreport how she knew that possible date or the significant of\nsuch. She said Relative C is the designee for Child A’s\nparent/child parenting visitation, and Wolverine relied on\nRelative C giving them adequate information. She said\nParent D and Parent E are not living together. Parent E\nresides with his parents. Parent D is living at Parent E old\nhouse, and Parent E reports wanting Parent D out of that\nhome.\nPD 2 acknowledged that Parent D may have been at an\nEarly On assessment with Child A; and may have reported\ninformation to the evaluators, but that would have been in\naddition to Relative C being there. PD 2 reported, Parent\nD’s visitations with Child A is the one consistent thing\nParent D has done. PD 2 reported Parent D has not acted\n10",
    "on any other required mandates; and the agency still\nbelieves it is in Child A’s best interest for Parent D’s rights\nto be terminated to achieved permanency for Child A, Thus,\nWolverine still plans to move forward with termination of\nParent D’s rights.\n• FCW 3 reported supervision of Child A’s and Parent D’s\nparenting visits was approved by the Court and the agency\nsometime in May or June of 2021, before FCW 3 was the\nassigned worker on the case. FCW 3 provided me a copy\nof the 5/5/2021 court order showing that a designee could\nsupervise the parenting visits. FCW 3 said Relative C\nwould report to her that all parent/child parenting visitations\nwere being supervised; and would provide her with the\ntimes and dates of those parenting visits.\nFCW 3 said she did not have any reason to believe\nRelative C was allowing Parent D to just take Child A\nunsupervised. FCW 3 said, at times, she would visit\nRelative C’s home during the same times that Parent D\nwas having her parenting time, and she did not observe\nconcerns. FCW 3 affirmed PD 2 reporting that other than\nregular visits with Child A, Parent D has not been compliant\nwith other requirements required for reunification. FCW 3\nfurther affirmed information reported by PD 2 related to the\nreported Facebook post. FCW 3 did not see the post. Nor\nhad she referenced it with Relative C because when the\nfoster parent went back to see the post/picture, it was gone.\nFCW 3 reported she has had a number of conservations\nwith Relative C and Parent D that all the parenting visits\nhave to be supervised; and both parents denied them being\notherwise.\nFCW 3 reported Parent D, as well as Parent E denied a\nrelationship with one another; and she has no specific\ninformation that they are in a relationship.\nMarijuana in Child A’s clothing, him being extremely dirty\nwhen he was replaced from Relative C’s home and his\ngeneral care while with Relative C:\n• PD 2 reported on 6/6/2023 she grabbed Child A’s diaper\nbag as she was moving him from Relative C care. After\narriving at the foster home and reaching into the diaper bag\nto remove clothing for Child A, she saw a small container at\nthe bottom of the diaper bag. The container contained\nresidue of marijuana leaves and or seeds. It was not a\n11",
    "joint. PD 2 called Parent D about this container; and Parent\nD apologized, said it was hers. Parent D said it should not\nhave been there. PD 2 did not report whether Parent D\nreported how or why the container was placed in the diaper\nbag. PD 2 did not report there being a concern of this type\nin the past.\nPD 2 reported the agency completed regular ongoing\nmonthly visits to Relative C’s home. There were general\nconcerns with Relative C not always following up with the\nagency on phone calls, her rescheduling home visits,\nmedical or dental timeliness, and her home at time showing\nsigns of clutter. There were not concerns around Relative\nC not feeding Child A, his clothes being too small or reports\nof him being dirty or unkept. PD 2 reported when she\nreplaced Child A from Relative C’s care on 6/6/2023 Child\nA had dirt on him, which Relative C reported was from him\nplaying outside. Child A was not filthy from head to toe, as\nalleged. Nor did Foster Parent B report such as was\nindicated in the complaint. Foster Parent B informed PD 2\nvia text that Child A loved bath time and rested well. Foster\nParent B never reported that Child A was so dirty that his\nbath water was filthy.\nPD 2 provided a copy the text messages between she and\nFoster Parent B following Child A’s placement on 6/6/2023.\nThe texts affirmed PD 2’s reporting about bath time/ the\nfoster parent not reporting dirty bath water.\n• FCW 3 reported information pertaining to the marijuana\nissue, Child A allegedly being dirty and having stained or a\nlack of clothing upon his placement to Foster Parent B’s\nand Foster Parent G’s home was something that came to\nPD 2’s attention, not hers’. She said she learned that\ninformation may have been reported by Foster Parent B to\nGAL X. FCW 3 said Foster Parent B did not make a\ncomplaint or concern directly to her.\nFCW 3 reported during her monthly visits to see Child A in\nhis placement with Relative C, his clothing and how he was\ndoing in the home was always assessed via her\nobservation. She would also complete a Safety\nAssessment (this is documented via a checklist form\nindicating the home’s condition/safety) for each visit. She\nsaid Relative C’s home would often have some clutter,\nRelative C would report Child A was sleeping well, doing\n12",
    "well, and FCW 3 observed him to be safe and well. FCW 3\nwas not aware of Child A not having sufficient or adequate\nfood or activities. She had observed him playing with toys.\nChild A’s head banging behavior and resulting boney bruise:\n• PD 2 denied the agency being awareness of Child A having\nheading banging behavior prior to 6/5/2023. On the\naforementioned date, while visiting Relative C’s new\nresidence, PD 2 observed Child A to bang his head on the\nwindow. Child A had run forward, hit his head, and then\nthrew himself back and had a tantrum. PD 2 said she\nquestioned Relative C and Parent D, who was also present,\nwhether Child A had always displayed this behavior, and\nthey reported Child A only did so when he was mad.\nRelative C and Parent D did not report how often Child A\ngot mad. The two parents reported talking with Child A’s\ndoctor about the behavior. They reported the doctor did not\ngive the behavior much attention, advised them to not\nreinforce the behavior.\nPD 2 did not observe any mark or bruise to Child A’s\nforehead at the time of her 6/5/2023 home visit with\nRelative C. PD 2 said Child A’s hair was covering that part\nof his head. The next day, on 6/6/2023 during Child A’s\nreplacement and completion of a body chart, PD 2 noticed\na red mark at the top of Child A’s head/hairline. The mark\nprotruded out. At that time, PD 2 informed Foster Parent B\nand Foster Parent B’s husband, Foster Parent G that PD 2\ndid not know about Child A’s head banging prior to the\n6//5/2023. PD 2 said it was at this point that Foster Parent\nG, a doctor, described the type of bruise on Child A’s\nforehead; and said one gets that from repeated head\nbanging. That day Child A was also observed being at\nease, playing roughly, tumbling, but not head banging.\nPD 2 reported the agency contacted Child A’s health\nprovider related to his head banging and the information\nreported by Relative C and Parent D,. The health care\nprovider disputed Relative C’s and Parent D’s claim and\nsaid they did not know about Child A’s head banging. The\nhealth care provider had no problem giving Child A a\nreferral for a helmet. In the interim Foster Parent G\nobtained a temporary helmet for Child A. Child A has the\nregular helmet now.\n13",
    "• FCW 3 reported she had observed Child A to tantrum by\nthrowing himself down, if told no; but she denied observing\nor being aware of Child A having head banging behaviors.\nShe did not become aware of that behaviors until after it\ncame to PD 2’s attention on 6/5/2023. FCW 3 became\naware of the ‘boney” bruise on Child A’s forehead, what\nFoster Parent G termed it, and how it likely came to be via\nPD 2 also. FCW 3 said Relative C and Parent D never\nreported Child A to have head banging behaviors. She\nsaid during the home visits to Relative C’s, she always\nasked Relative C and Parent D (who would, at times, be at\nRelative C’s home for parenting time) whether Child A had\nbehavior concerns or new behaviors, and both Relative C\nand Parent D would indicate Child A had none.\nFCW 3 acknowledged Child A’s head banging behavior\ncontinued after 6/5/2023. FCW 3 completed two foster\nhome visits with Child A’ in Foster Parent B’s and Foster\nParent G’s home, and FCW observed the head banging\nbehavior. She advised the foster parents to follow up with\nthe primary health care provider, which they did. The\nprimary health care provider recommended a protective\nhelmet and gave the foster family a prescription for the\nhelmet. In the interim, as reported by PD 2 the foster\nparents obtained a soft helmet for Child A. FCW 3 reported\nthe foster parents were also advised to have Child A wear\nthe helmet all day, to watch him closely, and provide bear\nlike hug to calm him with if needed to prevent banging\nbehavior.\nThe agency is not adequately assessing Parent E:\n• PD 2 denied the allegation. She explained that Parent E\narrived on the scene related to Child A this year. Parent E\nsigned an affidavit of parentage on 4/6/2023. PD 2\nexplained Wolverine had filed an mandated petition to\nterminate Parent E’s parental rights due to prior\nterminations of his rights to other children. PD 2 reported\nthat petition was later dismissed by the Court. The latter\ncame to be after DHHS (Department of Health and Human\nServices), and the prosecuting attorney met with Wolverine\nand a determination that all aspects from Parent E’s prior\nterminations had been rectified. The Court agreed and\ndismissed the permanent custody petition, allowing for a\nplan of placement for Child A with Parent E.\n14",
    "PD 2 reported Wolverine has assessed Parent E for\nplacement of Child A. She acknowledged that it is true\nParent E has past drug related issues and has a lengthy\ncriminal history that sent him to prison. He is on parole.\nShe said he also has a job, housing and is complying with\nhis parole. He lives with his mother and father and\nWolverine completed an ICHAT, and children service\nclearance for him and his parents. A home visit to Parent\nE’s parents’ home was completed and the home was\nappropriate. PD 2 reported GAL X is concern with Parent\nE’s history. GAL X fears that Parent E will relapse,\nsomething PD 2 reports they can’t speak to, because there\nis no way to know that he will, because he also may not.\nPD 2 reported the DHHS monitor, who has been at the last\nthree court hearings, nor the Court had concerns with the\nGAL’s allegations.\n• FCW 3 denied the agency not assessing Parent E. She\nreported that in August 2022 Parent E really began to\nengage with the agency. She advised that in the past\nParent E had been recorded as the putative father, and in\nOctober 2022, Parent E initiated the DNA process. She\nsaid, at first Parent E was apprehensive about planning for\nChild A, because Parent E did not want to interfere with\nParent D’s chances. Once Parent E saw that Parent D was\nnot doing what was required to bring about Child A’s return\nhome, Parent E completed the DNA process in January\n2023; and completed an affidavit of parentage in April\n2023. FCW 3 said, Parent E has housing and has provided\nproof of employment. FCW 3 confirmed PD 2’s reporting\nrelated to Parent E’s parole, compliance with that parole,\nand residence with his parents. FCW 3 said Parent E had\nput off her checking out his parents’ home due to some\nmistrust; but a home visit was completed on 6/9/2023. The\nhome was assessed as appropriate; and Parent E’s,\nparents have adopted one of Parent E’s sons; so, if placed\nwith Parent E, Child A would be with a sibling.\nFCW 3 reported though there is an objection by GAL X\nabout Child A’s placement with Parent E, the Court has\naccepted the reunification plan with Parent E. The agency\nwas awaiting the court order for such.\n15",
    "Document Review:\n• Child A’s MISACWIS case record and social work contacts\nwhich showed no missed monthly home visits with the child\nand his care providers.\n• Copies of a year’s worth of Safety Assessments, which:\n✓ Are documented in the form of checklists. Are from\n7/26/2022 through 5/11/2023 at Relative C ‘s\nreported Belleville home.\n✓ For 6/8/2023, 6/22/2023, 7/7/2023 and 7/19/2023 in\nthe child’s respective foster home at the time.\n✓ Showed, with the exception of the 6/8/2023 Safe\nSafety Assessment, all others indicated, “Yes” to the\nquestion, does the child have adequate clothing\n(based on the child’s current\nsize/weather/appropriate/ minimum of a week’s\nworth). The 6/8/2023 Safety Assessment also\nindicated yes, with a written note that the “FCW\nbrought more clothes, shoes and toys”.\n• Copies of a years’ worth of monthly foster home visit sheets\nforms from 7//26/2022 to 7/30/2023. The foster home visit\nsheets from 6/6/2023 to 7/30/2023 are at Child A’s Foster\nhome. The ones from 7/26/2022 to 5/11/2023 are at\nRelative C’s Belleville home. A 6/5/2023 visit is at the\nreported Inkster home where Relative C reported residing\nwith Person H. The home visit sheets showed the worker\nvisited the caregiver’s home between 25 and 35 minutes.\nThe home visit sheets showed the FCW engaged the\ncaregiver in discussions about Child A’s dental and medical\nexams/ needs, development, what/how the child was\ndoing/progressing, Early On referrals/assessments, speech\nneeds/efforts, the home, and DOCs (Difficulty of Care). My\nview of social work contact entries confirmed these date\nand other monthly home visits.\n• Copies of an ICHAT with an all-clear central clearance\ncheck for Parent E’s girlfriend (dated 6/5/2023), and Parent\nE’s parents (dated 6/12/2023). Also, an ICHAT for Parent E\n(dated 6/12/2023) showing his past criminal history from\n2001-2022.\n• Copy of a May 5, 2021, court order related to a designee\nbeing able to supervise Child A’s parenting time.\n• A 6/9/2023 social work contact showing Parent E’s home\nwas assessed.\n• Case documentation showing a Team Decision Meeting\noccurred on 7/11/2023 to prepare for Child A’s placement\nwith Parent E and to discuss Child A’s developmental\n16",
    "needs, referrals for services, visitation requirements for\nParent D, and court.\n• An 8/11/2023 social work contact that indicated the court\norder was received and Child A was placed in Parent E’s\nhome on that date.\nAnalysis The agency was completing required homes visits to the child’s\nplacement, and with the child and caregiver to monitor his\nplacement. The agency also put forth continued actions to monitor\nand to remind Relative C of her responsibilities and parenting time\nsupervisory role.\nAdditionally, the agency completed a home assessment and\nsafety clearances related to Parent E and the other household\nmembers in the home Parent E resides. The placement plan for\nChild A with Parent E was approved by the court.\nThough the evidence suggest that Relative C was not completely\ntruthful with the agency related to Child A’s behaviors, or all of\nParent D’s interaction in the home; there is insufficient evidence to\nsupport the complaint allegations or a lack of workers not working\ndirectly with the child, their families, and other relevant individuals\nrelated to the service plans.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISH.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421- Visitation and family time; in person\nSection contact.\nDescription (2) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster child and\nthe foster parent, if applicable in the child’s placement at least\nonce every month.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not do adequate monitoring of the child by making\nrequired monthly home visits to the grandmother's home. The\ngrandmother was homeless as of October 2022, but the agency\ndid not know this; and did not report this to the GAL until June\n2023.\nInvestigation Complainant\nOn 7/21/2023 I interviewed the complainant, Guardian Ad Litem\n(GAL) X by telephone. GAL X reported the agency must have not\nbeen making required monthly home visit to Child A’s placement\nwith Relative C. She reported if the agency had been making\n17",
    "adequate home visits they would have known Relative C had a\nproblem with housing. Additionally, they would have been able to\nsee that Child A was not receiving the structure that he needed\nrelated to his needs. GAL X reported there were times she had to\ncontact the agency related to getting in contact with Relative C,\nbecause Relative C’s phone was out. Additionally, that there\nwere times Relative C would not allow GAL X to have GAL X’s\nvisits at Relative C’s home. Relative C would say Relative C\nwould bring Child A to GAL X’s office and the visit would take\nplace there. GAL X said she had multiple facetime visit with\nRelative C and Child A. GAL X reported some of those visit were\nduring COVID.\nGAL X reported after the agency reported Relative C’s\nhomelessness in June 2023, Relative C was then living with a\nrelative that had a Pitbulls and a cluttered home. The agency did\nnot seem very concerned about that, and PD 2 wanted to reserve\nChild A’s placement with Relative C. GAL X expressed safety\nconcerns and questioned why PD 2 would seek to maintain Child\nA's placement in that environment. GAL X acknowledged Child A\nwas replaced from Relative C/ was not maintained in the relative\nhome Relative C had moved to.\nProgram Director 2\nOn 7/24/2023 I interviewed Program Director (PD) 2 onsite at the\nagency. PD 2 reported Relative C lived in Belleville, Michigan\nand the FCW 3 always saw Child A with Relative C in the same\nhome/location. PD 2 reported an unusual incident came up at\nFCW 3’s 5/11/2023 home visit to Relative C’s home. The worker\nsaw an extra bed in the home in an inappropriate area. Relative C\nwould not tell FCW 3 a clear explanation as to why the bed was\nthere. FCW 3 advised Relative C to remove the bed, and\nexplained the safety issue, because mattress was in a\nnonapproved area of the home. The incident ultimately triggered\nWolverine’s licensing department’s intervention.\nThe agency’s licensing department staff reached out to Relative\nC’s landlord on 6/5/2023. At that time the landlord reported\nRelative C had not lived at the Belleville apartment home since\nOctober 2022. A specific date in October 2022 was not reported,\nand PD 2 did not know whether the landlord reported whether\nRelative C had moved or had been evicted. Nor whether their\nagency’s licensing staff had asked for that distinction. PD 2 said\nRelative C’s home was a duplex apartment and Relative C had a\nrelationship with the family next door. PD 2 said there was\nnothing that would have led them to know or believe Relative C\n18",
    "did not live there. Relative C was home for the FCW 3’s home\nvisits and Relative C’s and Child A’s belonging appeared in place.\nPD 2 reported after their licensing staff’s contact with Relative C’s\nlandlord on 6/5/2023, she made contact with Relative C by\ntelephone, and then in person. Relative C reported she and Child\nA were residing with a friend, Person H in Inkster Michigan. PD 2\nsaid she and a coworker spent two hours at this Inkster home.\nShe talked with Relative C, Person H and assessed the home for\nsafety. Prior to the home visit she contacted children services\nrelated to the situation with the placement and Relative C.\nRelative C told PD 2 she moved; and since she did to think she\nwas allowed to move; she did not tell the agency because she did\nnot want to jeopardy Child A’s placement with her. Relative C\nsaid she thought the agency would remove Child A from her care.\nPD 2 reported she advised Relative C that her reasoning was not\naccurate, did make sense; and PD 2 asked Relative C what was\nreally going on, but Relative C kept reporting the same statement,\nas before.\nPD 2 affirmed that their assessment of Person H’s home\nconfirmed some if not all that may have been reported in the\ncomplaint related to the home being clutter, and there being pit\nbulls. She said some rooms in the home had clutter stacked from\nfloor to ceiling, medication was on a table, cleaning supplies were\nnot stored properly out of reach, and no fire/ carbon monoxide\ndetector. Child A and Relative C were in a separate room from\nPerson H but were sharing a bed. PD 2 advised that she did not\nbelieves that Relative C was living in this home, because PD 2 did\nnot see many of Child A’s or Relative C’s person things. But\nRelative C and Person H insisted Relative C was staying there.\nNeither reported when Relative C had moved into the home. PD 2\nreported Wolverine safety planned with Relative C and Person H\nfor that evening. Wolverine purchased a pack and play for Child A\nto sleep in, a carbon monoxide/fire detector for the kitchen and\nobtained a baby gate which was used to block off Child A from the\nhallway and kitchen, keeping him from the cleaning supplies.\nPerson H said the dog were friendly and Child A has been around\nthen, but Person H agreed to keep the dog outside, and to lock up\nher medication immediately. Relative C signed the safety plan\nand PD 2 was to return the next date, which she did.\nPD 2 reported she contacted GAL X and informed her of Relative\nC’s living situation/move on 6/5/2023. PD 2 admitted that she told\nGAL X that in most cases when children are with relatives the\nagency tries to preserve the placement, when that goal is feasible.\n19",
    "PD 2 reported after some discussion and from seeing Person H’s\nhome, the agency removed Child A from Relative C’s care the\nnext date on 6/6/2023. PD 2 reported the move was based on\nsafety concerns at that time and what was in Child A best interest,\nnot any alleged threat from the GAL. She said Relative C was\nprovided a DHS-30- Foster Parent/Caregiver Notification of Move\nregarding the replacement. Relative C appealed to the FCRB and\nthe FCRB agreed with Wolverine’s replacement decision.\nFoster Care Worker 3\nOn 8/2/2023 I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) 3 onsite at\nthe agency. FCW 3 affirmed information as reported by PD 2\nrelated to monthly home visit being conducted regularly to\nRelative C’s home. Additionally, the results of a relative home\nvisit on 5/11/2023 whereby FCW 3 observed a mattress on the\nfloor of Relative C’s home in area with no egress and what\noccurred thereafter with the agency licensing intervention, and\nthere on. FCW 3 said Relative C denied anyone else living in the\nhome, and Relative 3 moved the mattress, as that was a red flag\nshe reported it to her supervisor and children services complaint\nwas called in. She reported there had been another time whereby\nshe had observed adults and children in the home, and she\nreported that also. Relative C’s explanation about that seemed\nplausible and ICHAT occurred for the adults then.\nFCW 3 denied having any suspicious or inclinations that Relative\nC had not been living in the Belleville home since October 2022.\nShe said Relative C would either be in the home when she arrived\nfor the home visitor or Resident C was arriving home just after\nFCW 3 arrived. FCW 3 reported not thinking more about the fact\nthat Relative C was arriving to home after her arrival, because\nalthough Relative C did not work, Relative C reported she was\nattending to medical needs and or errands. Those explanations\nseemed valid at the time. Additionally, Relative C’s and Child A\nbelongings, including the couch, Child A’s crib, toys were still in\nthe home during each of the visits. In hindsight FCW 3 surmises\nRelative C’s landlord who is either a relative or friend to Relative C\nmay have aided Relative C in hiding her housing situation from the\nagency.\nDocument Review:\n• Safety Assessment checklists and home visits sheets as\ndescribed earlier.\n• Monthly home visit social work contacts showing home\nvisits were made to Relative C’s home; and for issues\nobserved on a previous homes visits, action was taken.\n20",
    "• A copy of the 6/5/2023 Safety Plan Wolverine completed\nwith Relative C on 6/5/2022 which outlined the\ninformation/safety measures PD 2 reported Wolverine put\nin place for that evening.\nAnalysis The evidence does not support the allegations. Nor a lack of\nmonthly home visits by the agency to assess Child A’s placement.\nHome visits were occurring. Relative C was somehow able to\nconceal her housing situation/homelessness from the agency with\nthe aid from others.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12411- Clothing.\nSection An agency must ensure that a foster child has the minimum\nDescription required clothing specified by the department’s policy and leaves\nthe foster home with not less than the minimum required clothing.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency’s director told the foster parent to give the child's\nclothing back to his grandmother which violates the rule of a\nchild's clothing being the child's.\nInvestigation Complainant\nOn 7/21/2023 I interviewed the complainant, Guardian Ad Litem\n(GAL) X by telephone. GAL X reported it was reported that Child\nA’s clothing were stained and were not appropriated. Additionally,\nPD 2 told Foster Parent B to give Child A’s smaller clothing back\nto Relative C which is against State policy and rule.\nProgram Director 2\nOn 7/24/2023 I interviewed Program Director (PD) 2 onsite at the\nagency. I also had followed up email contact with PD 2 about\nChild A’s sufficiency of clothing on 8/12/2023 and 8/21/2023.\nPD 2 said she never told Foster Parent B Child A’s too small\nclothing had to go back to Relative C. She told Foster Parent B if\nthere were clothing items that were not useable or did not fit Child\nA, PD 2 could give them back to Relative C. She said she never\ngot any clothes back and the agency purchased clothing for child\nA the next day. She advised that since Child A’s move from\nRelative C was unplanned a clothing checklist was not completed.\nShe reported that typically a clothing checklist does not occur at\nreplacements, but they do them to determine initial clothing order\nrequests when the children come into care, and for special\nclothing order requests. She reported she told Foster Parent B\n21",
    "that day that if Child A needed something the agency would\npurchase it for him.\nPD 2 said she and Foster Parent B went through Child A’s items\nthe day he moved into the foster home; and immediately after\nFoster Parent B put the clothing in the washer. They discussed\nitems Child A needed and Wolverine purchased summer items for\nChild A the next day, so as to get him started with any clothing he\nneeded.\nFoster Care Worker 3\nOn 8/2/2023 I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) 3 onsite at\nthe agency. FCW 3 indicated Child A had clothing and the agency\npurchased clothing and toys for him when he was replaced from\nRelative C’s home. She reported she assesses for a child’s\nclothing needs during monthly home visits. She does that by\ntalking with the caregiver about what the child has or needs; and\nexamining the child’s clothing closet/area; as she did with Child A.\nShe then documents on the monthly Safety Assessment whether\nthe child has adequate clothing.\nFCW 3 was not aware of PD 2 telling Foster Parent B that Foster\nParent B could or should give Child A’s small clothes back to\nRelative C.\nFoster Parent B\nOn 8/8/2023, I interviewed Foster Parent B by telephone. Foster\nParent B was not sure of the agency’s clothing policy but admitted\nshe may have signed a document about it when she was first\nlicensed.\nFoster Parent B reported when Child A was placed in her foster\nhome he, did not have pants on and he was dirty. She said, Child\nA had some clothing in a diaper bag, and PD 2 did not leave the\nbag because of what PD 2 reported finding in the bag. The\nclothing PD 2 left had stains, and some things were too small.\nThe clothing were sizes 18-24 months and Child A is a size four.\nFoster Parent B said Wolverine purchased some clothes for Child\nA, like Croc shoes (which were too small) tank tops, and shorts.\nFoster Parent B reported she and her husband also purchased\nclothes for Child A. She reported being surprised that they would\nnot get reimbursed for the clothing, but PD 2 told them they could\nnot get reimbursed for the clothing because Child A was not\neligible for a new clothing order. She said PD 2 told them to not\nthrow anything out, that too small items would go back to Relative\nC. Foster Parent B was not sure if that was because the items\nwere purchased by Relative C.\n22",
    "Document Review:\n• The agency’s clothing policy which indicated:\n✓ To foster parents the daily clothing stipend amount,\nsemiannual clothing supplements information; and\nthe combined monthly stipend of the regular foster\ncare stipend to provide for the child’s needed\nclothing.\n✓ Other expectations for the foster parent/caregiver\nand that the form is to be signed by the foster\nparent/caregiver and agency.\n• Copy of a Clothing Policy signed by Foster Parent B and\nFoster Parent G on 2/25/2020.\n• Copies of a year’s worth of Safety Assessments for Child A,\nwhich: indicated, “Yes” to the question, does the child have\nadequate clothing (based on the child’s current\nsize/weather/appropriate/ minimum of a week’s worth).\n• A Safety Assessment for Child A dated 6/8/2023, indicating\nChild A had adequate clothing, and that the FCW brought\nmore clothes and shoes for Child A\nAnalysis PD 2 and the foster parent reported somewhat conflicting\nreporting as to what PD 2 told the foster parent related to what to\ndo with Child A’s too small clothing.\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the allegation or that\nChild A did not have the minimum required clothing.\nConsultation & Technical Assistance:\nThe agency was advised that the completion of the DHS-3377\nClothing Inventory Checklist at a child’s replacement may aid it in\nmaking and showing a clearer determination of the child’s clothing\nneeds and rule compliance documentation.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLSHED.\nII. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the agency’s current licensing status is recommended.\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date September 5, 2023\nLicensing Consultant\n23",
