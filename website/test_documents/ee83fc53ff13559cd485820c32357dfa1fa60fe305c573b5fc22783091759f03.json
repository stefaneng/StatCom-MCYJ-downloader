INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nDescription supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval checks\nshall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The facility did not complete variable interval checks every 15\nminutes or less for multiple days.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nThe Complainant is this Consultant as this Consultant was\nmade aware of the information during a quarterly\nunannounced visit to the facility on 8/17/23.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/30/23. Supervisor reported Staff 1 is a typical third shift staff\nmember who works Sunday-Wednesday and Staff 2 is a typical\nthird shift staff member who works Thursday-Saturday. Supervisor\nreported Staff 2 had been on vacation for two weeks, but she was\nable to speak to Staff 1 about the allegations. Staff 1 told\nSupervisor she sits in the hallway to avoid the youth going AWOL\nbut does not do eyes-on checks by going into each room because\nthe youth do not like it when staff open their doors as the light\nshines in their faces. Supervisor reported Staff 1 was not\ncompleting observation logs during her shift because Staff 1 said\nshe could not find the blank log sheets. Supervisor reported she is\nnot aware how long it’s been since Staff 1 stopped documenting\nobservations, but Staff 1 has been completing observation log\nsheets since 8/19/23 when Supervisor provided her with them.\nSupervisor reported she was unaware these checks were an issue\nuntil the unannounced visit completed by this Consultant on\n8/17/23. Supervisor reported she spoke with Staff 1 on 8/19/23\nand explained the process for conducting checks, importance of\ncompleting checks and what her requirements were. Supervisor\nreported staff are not conducting or completing eyes-on checks on\n2",
    "the youth after 8 am, even if the youth are sleeping or are in their\nrooms for extended periods of time.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/18/23.\nStaff 1 reported prior to this investigation, her understanding of her\nresponsibilities were to ensure the youth do not go AWOL\novernight and check on the youth if she heard something unusual.\nShe reported the youth are in their rooms but are frequently not\nsleeping until after 2:30 AM. She reported after 3:00 AM, she is\nvery tired and tends to rest her eyes at times, but reported she\ndoes not sleep. Staff 1 reported she wants to reduce her hours\nbecause it’s very hard for her to stay awake and it’s too much for\nher to go up and down the stairs so often due to her age. Staff 1\nreported having two people work during third shift would be much\nbetter; especially if one staff member was downstairs and one\nstaff member was upstairs.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 9/21/23. Staff 2 reported\nprior to this investigation, her understanding of her responsibilities\nwas if nothing is going on with the youth, and they are in their\nrooms, she didn’t have to check on them. Staff 2 reported she was\ndoing checks by being around the bedrooms but did not complete\neyes-on checks. She reported she documented completing\nchecks every fifteen minutes or less because she checked that the\ngirls remained in their rooms. Staff 2 reported it would be much\neasier to have two staff working third shift; especially if one staff\nmember was downstairs and one staff member was upstairs.\nVIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED:\nVideo footage was reviewed for three overnight shifts, which are\ndetailed below. It should be noted, Staff 1 was notified about the\ninvestigation as well as reminded of her responsibilities and\nrequirements by Supervisor on 8/19/23. It should also be noted,\nStaff 3 normally works second shift, but was helping out on third\nshift from 8/23/23-8/24/23 due to Staff 2 being on vacation.\n• 8/8/23 at 11:30 PM through 8/9/23 at 7:00 AM\no Basement: Staff 1 did not go downstairs the entirety\nof the shift, and therefore, did not complete any\neyes-on interval checks as required.\no Upstairs: Staff 1 did not complete any eyes-on\ninterval checks as required. For almost the entirety\nof the shift, Staff 1 was sitting in the chair at the end\nof the upstairs bedroom hallway under a blanket and\nit looks as if she is sleeping. However, there were a\nfew times she was on her phone or moving her foot.\n3",
    "• 8/23/23 at 11:15 PM through 8/24/23 at 6:30 AM\no Basement: Staff 3 completed interval checks in the\nbasement bedrooms at 12:15 AM, 1:43 AM, 4:05\nAM, 5:34 AM and 6:09 AM.\no Upstairs: Staff 3 completed interval checks in the\nupstairs bedrooms at 12:12 AM, 1:45 AM, 3:19 AM,\n4:04 AM, 5:04 AM, 5:11 AM, 6:08 AM and 6:25 AM.\nWhen Staff 3 was not completing checks, she is\nsitting in a chair at the end of the upstairs bedroom\nhallway or in other areas of the home.\n• 8/26/23 at 11:40 PM through 8/27/23 at 7:00 AM\no Basement: Staff 1 did not go downstairs the entirety\nof the shift, and therefore, did not complete any\ninterval checks as required.\no Upstairs: Staff 1 completed eyes-on checks at 12:37\nAM, 12:47 AM, 1:09 AM, 1:45 AM and 6:52 AM.\nFrom 2:00 AM-6:51 AM, Staff 1 was sitting in the\nchair at the end of the upstairs bedroom hallway\nunder a blanket and it looks as if she is sleeping.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Bethany Christian Services Bellaview Policies and\nProcedures: Staff to Resident Ratio (updated 8/3/23) states\nwhen residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval,\neye-on checks of the residents, which should not exceed\n15 minutes. It should be noted, this information is repeated\nunder the information “during awake hours” as well as\n“during overnight hours”. It notes staff must be always\nawake. It also notes visual checks must be electronically\nrecord on the unit computer, and if it’s not possible,\nmonitoring must be done via paper documentation.\n• Bed Check Observation Log for 8/23/23-8/24/23 completed\nby Staff 3 outlines interval checks Staff 3 reports she\ncompleted. It should be noted five of the interval checks\nlisted exceed fifteen minutes. In addition, these checks are\ninconsistent with the review of video footage outlined\nabove.\n• Bed Check Observation Log for 8/26/23-8/27/23 completed\nby Staff 1 outlines interval checks Staff 3 reports she\ncompleted.

It should be noted\nchecks were written as being completed every fifteen\nminutes exactly, rather than at variable intervals.\n• Bed Check Observation Logs for overnight shifts on\n8/21/23-8/22/23, 8/22/23-8/23/23, 8/27/23-8/28/23, 8/28/23-\n8/29/23, 8/29/23-8/30/23 completed by Staff 1 outlines\ninterval checks Staff 1 reported she completed. It should be\nnoted there were multiple interval checks listed exceeding\nfifteen minutes.\n• Staff 1 completed Shadow Shifts and Apprentice Shift to\nlearn the responsibilities of her role and policies associated\nwith her role (including observation checks & the facility’s\nstaff to resident ratio policy) between November-December\n2018. Staff 1 signed off that she understood third shift\nduties (including interval checks) on 8/17/23. Staff 1 has\none disciplinary record in her employee file (a performance\ncoaching form), which is related to this investigation.\n• Staff 2 completed Orientation, Shadow Shifts, and an\nApprentice Shift to learn the responsibilities of her role and\npolicies associated with her role (including observation\nchecks & the facility’s staff to resident ratio policy) between\nDecember 2022-January 2023. Staff 2 does not have any\ndisciplinary records in her employee file.\n• Staff 3 completed Orientation, Shadow Shifts, and an\nApprentice Shift to learn the responsibilities of her role and\npolicies associated with her role (including observation\nchecks & the facility’s staff to resident ratio policy) between\nJanuary-February 2023. Staff 2 does not have any\ndisciplinary records in her employee file.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted, documents reviewed, and video\nfootage reviewed, this violation is established. Staff 1, Staff 2 and\nStaff 3 failed to conduct eyes-on checks in intervals not to exceed\nfifteen minutes while youth were in their rooms and/or sleeping. In\naddition, Supervisor reported eyes-on interval checks are not\nbeing completed or documented past third shift, even if youth are\nin their rooms and/or sleeping.\n5",
    "Technical Assistance:\no Interval checks must be conducted not to exceed 15\nminutes; however, they should not be every 15 minutes\nexactly. Youth pay attention to when staff check on them,\nso if staff are checking every 15 minutes exactly, youth will\nnotice and will take advantage of it.\no Interval checks must be conducted when residents are\noutside of the direct supervision of staff. Therefore, if youth\nare in their rooms, outside, etc. interval checks must be\nconducted by staff anytime the youth is not within their line\nof sight (not to exceed 15 minutes). Staff will have to\nmonitor and time how long youth are out of their sight to\nensure they meet this requirement.\no Interval checks must be conducted eyes on, which means\nstaff must visually see the youth and verify they are okay.\nConsultation:\n• Ensure all staff policies and forms are written in a staff\nmember’s primary language to ensure ease of\nunderstanding. Consultant provided “How To” instructions\nto facility on 9/29/23 to convert forms.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & ACT 116 - 722.120 Investigation, inspection, and examination\nSection of conditions, books, records, and reports; access by\nDescription department, bureau of fire services, or local authorities;\nrecords; reports report; forms; confidentiality; disclosure of\ninformation; availability of confidential records; child\ninformation cards to be provided to department; failure of\nlicensee to cooperation with investigation, inspection or\nexamination.\n(1) The department may investigate, inspect, and examine\nconditions of a childcare organization and may investigate\nand examine the books and records of the licensee.
