Supervisor 1\nreported she was involved in a situation with Youth A on April 14th\nat the facility. Supervisor 1 reported she had been terminated due\nto the incident. Supervisor 1 reported she had just had an issue\nwith Youth A over the weekend and due to that incident, she\nspoke to Administrator 1 to remove her as supervisor. Supervisor\n1 reported she did not want to supervise anymore due the lack of\nrespect from the youth in the facility and lack of structure provided\nby staff. After this meeting, Administrator 1 went to the classroom\nand discussed disrespect with the youth. Youth A became upset,\npushed Staff 1 and went into the hallway.

Administrator 1\nleft the building and Supervisor 1 reported she did not leave for a\nbreak due to wanting to help the staff with Youth A.\nSupervisor 1 reported she saw Youth A in the cafeteria with Staff\n2. They were both sitting down at separate tables. Supervisor 2\ncame into the cafeteria and sat down at another table. She did not\nthink that Staff 2 should be alone with Youth A due to her\nbehaviors. There was no physical aggression shown by Youth A\n5",
    "at this point. Youth A was sitting at a table and got up when she\nsaw Supervisor 1 enter. Youth A attempted to walk out of the\ncafeteria and Supervisor 1 reported she called for a standing hold.\nWhen asked why she called for this, she thought Staff 2 was\npushed by Youth A. (Staff taking hold of the upper arms). Staff 2\nwas unable to get her hold stabilized so Youth A began punching\nSupervisor 1 multiple times in the face. Youth A grabbed her hair\nand they were “body to body” in the hallway. Supervisor 1\nreported she only spoke, “Let my hair go.” She reported she struck\nYouth A with a closed fist twice.

Once outside Youth A was\nreleased and no one was doing anything anymore.\nSupervisor 1 reported no one else punched Youth A. Supervisor 1\nreported Supervisor 2 was the only staff helping in the situation.\nSupervisor 1 reported Administrator 1, Staff 1, and Staff 2 did not\nhelp the situation and felt that if they were helping, this situation\nmight not have occurred the way it did. Supervisor 1 denied hitting\nYouth A in the corner and denied saying anything inappropriate to\nYouth A. Supervisor 1 also denied anyone else saying anything\ninappropriate to Youth A.\nAttempts were made to contact Supervisor 2 on 6/5/25, 6/11/25,\nand 6/13/25. Supervisor 2 did not return phone calls and on\n6/11/25 she reported she no longer works at the facility and did\nnot want to answer questions.\nVideo Observation:\nI reviewed the video on 4/14/25 and an additional video clip\non 5/15/25.

Youth A was seated in the\ncafeteria and was not displaying physically aggressive behaviors.\nYouth A became “angry” when Supervisor 1 came into the\ncafeteria, but this was not a valid reason to use the CPI hold and\nplace Youth A into a restraint.
