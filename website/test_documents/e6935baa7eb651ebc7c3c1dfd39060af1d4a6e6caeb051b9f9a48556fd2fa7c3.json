There was no\nevidence of rats at the facility. The facility was appropriately\n4",
    "maintained, and no safety hazards were noted. I interviewed Staff 2\nwho reported the agency does have a pest control company come into\nthe facility for inspections on a monthly basis. The most recent 3\nmonths of inspections were received to provide confirmation and did\nnot document rats. I interviewed Staff 1 who is the caseworker for\nComplainant 1. Staff 1 stated Complainant 1 later recanted his\nallegations other than the issue of the agency withholding the stipend\nchecks for the youth. I interviewed Staff 3 who reported everything is\ngoing well and expressed no environmental concerns. Staff 3 is the\ntherapist for participants in this program.\nI interviewed Youth A by telephone on 02/16/2023 and Youth A\nconfirmed he had not seen any rats in the facility.\nAnalysis There is no evidence of rats being found in the facility. The facility is\nwell maintained with no safety/environmental hazards noted. The\nagency is contracted with a pest control company for monthly\ninspections and maintenance.\nConclusion No Violations\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12503-2-f\nSection The policies and procedures shall cover at least all of the following\nDescription areas (f) Amount of financial support and how it is disbursed.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency is withholding payment checks to coerce youth compliance with\ncontract requirements.\nInvestigation I participated in a PCU conference on 11/22/2022 with Social Worker 1\nand agency representatives. The agency confirmed the withholding of\nsubsidy checks from participants as needed to coerce participant\ncompliance with their program contracts. It was reported the agency is\nin the process of completing meetings with program staff to review\nprogram policies and procedures and establish alternatives to this\npractice.\nI interviewed Complainant 1 at the agency/facility on 11/21/2022. The\ncomplainant stated the agency would sometimes withhold participant’s\nsubsidy checks until the participants cleaned their rooms or completed\nother responsibilities associated with their program contracts.\nComplainant 1 indicated that when a participant was in compliance,\nthey were given their program subsidy check.\n4",
    "I completed an exit conference on 01/04/2023 with Administrator 1 who\nacknowledged the practice of withholding participants subsidy\npayments and reported the practice was no longer being used.\nAdministrator 1 indicated the agency was reevaluating program\npractices to develop alternative methods of encouraging participants\ncompliance with their program contracts.\nA copy of the program policies, procedures, and supporting documents\nwere received. There is no provision noted for withholding checks due\nto negotiate compliance.\nAnalysis The policies/procedures received did not indicate/support the practice\nof the agency withholding participants’ subsidy checks as a form of\nenforcing contract compliance by the participants. However, interviews\nwith Complainant 1 and staff confirmed this had been a practice by the\nagency as a means of enforcing program participation expectations.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy.\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the that\nthe current license status be continued.\n02/16/2023\n_____________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/16/2023\n____________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4",
