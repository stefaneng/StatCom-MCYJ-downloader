She stated Youth A’s\nface is not shown in some of the pictures, but it is shown in others.\nShe believes the agency was already aware due to foster\nplacement’s employment and her connection to the agency.\nThese concerns were reported to the agency.\nBiological Mother was interviewed on April 15, 2024, via\ntelephone. She stated she became aware approximately 4 weeks\nago that Foster Parent had posted pictures of Youth A on\nFacebook and did not always conceal her identity. She stated\nthere are 2-3 pictures where Youth A’s face is visible.

She stated Biological Mother did\nnot notify her of concerns regarding Foster Parent posting pictures\nof Youth A on Facebook.

    "Foster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nApril 18, 2024. She stated Biological Mother did not inform her of\nconcerns regarding Foster Parent posting pictures of Youth A on\nFacebook. She is now aware of those concerns due to Foster\nParent’s licensing worker contacting her within the past week.\nDHS Licensing worker (DHS LW) was interviewed via\ntelephone on June 28, 2024. She stated she conducted an\ninvestigation involving Foster Parent regarding concerns that she\nhad posted 2-3 pictures of Youth A on Facebook that showed her\nface.

Biological Mother reported her religious preference to\nFCW shortly after Youth A was removed on September 1, 2023,\nand this can be verified through texts and emails between\nBiological Mother and FCW.\nComplainant stated FCW informed Biological Mother she never\nreported her religious preference to the agency. FCW stated she\nasked Youth A about religion, and she reported she has no\nmemory of that religion and, therefore, is able to choose what\nreligion she affiliates with. Youth A is required to attend weekly\nChristian church services, prayer in the home, attends Christian\npre-school and is subjected to religious discussions in the foster\nplacement that do not align with Biological Mother’s reported\nreligious preference.\nBiological Mother was interviewed on April 15, 2024, via\ntelephone. She stated she reported the religion that she and\nYouth A identify with immediately after removal and has several\ntimes throughout the case. She stated she was asked about her\nreligion during the Children’s Protective Services (CPS) case and\nstated several times to CPS that her religion is Norse Pagan.\nBiological Mother stated FCW told her that Youth A can choose\nher religious preference despite being 5 years old and has been\nraised in this religion since birth. She stated Youth A came in to\nparenting time a few times and made comments regarding\nChristianity and not wanting to learn more about Norse Pagan.\nBiological Mother stated her attorney informed the judge during a\ncourt hearing and during a Family Team Meeting (FTM) that her\nreligion is Norse Pagan, and she wanted her daughter to be raised\nthe same, but the agency has not taken any steps to ensure that\nis happening. Youth A is required to attend a Christian church with\nfoster placement, participate in prayer and attend a Christian\nbased school.\nBiological Mom stated she had no say in Youth A being enrolled in\na Christian based school. She was enrolled because it was easier\nfor Foster Parent, but she was never given a choice or consulted.\nShe was not told Youth A was enrolled in this school for months\nafter she was removed. She stated she has only known about the\nschool in the last 2-3 months. Biological Mother clarified she is not\n4",
    "against Youth A finishing the school year where she is since the\nschool year is almost over but if the case continues, she does not\nwant her to attend a Christian based school next year.\nBiological Mother stated Youth A is currently not practicing or\nparticipating in anything related to their religion. She stated she\nwas told she can introduce things to a point during her parenting\ntime but when she has attempted to do so she was told it was\ninappropriate and is not allowed to have her phone during visits.\nShe stated Youth A was upset during a parenting time before\nEaster and made comments about Jesus, the crucifixion and\nbeing nailed to the cross and stabbed. She stated Youth A was\nmaking comments about needing to help Jesus.\nFC Supervisor was interviewed via telephone on April 17,\n2024. FC Supervisor stated the agency was provided a 5-day\npacket upon case transfer from the referring agency after Youth A\nwas initially removed. The packet includes the removal petition,\nremoval order and documentation from Youth A’s foster care case\nin Washington. The packet was sent electronically in 3 separate\nattachments. She stated a case transfer meeting was held and\nthere was no discussion regarding religion. The agency was not\nprovided any documentation regarding the investigation that led to\nYouth A’s removal, specifically the Investigation Report. FC\nSupervisor did not recall specifically inquiring about Youth A’s\nreligion during the case transfer meeting. They usually ask the\nreferring worker for all of the information they have about the\ncase.\nYouth A has been placed in the same foster home placement\nsince she was removed on September 1, 2023. The foster family\nis part of a different religion and Biological Mother did not express\na preference. She stated the first time she was made aware of\nBiological Mother’s religious preference was during a court\nhearing on February 14, 2024. After the court hearing on February\n14, 2024, the agency asked Biological Mother to provide\nresources in order to learn more about her religion and provide\nage-appropriate material such as books and prayers. Biological\nMother is allowed to discuss her religion during parenting time as\nlong as it is age appropriate. On April 16, 2024, Biological Mother\ninformed the agency of what services or activities she does not\nwant Youth A to participate in while in the foster home placement\nor with the foster placement. FC Supervisor stated she will send\nthat information to the foster family’s licensing worker to review\nwith the foster family who has a scheduled visit on April 18, 2024.\n5",
    "FC Supervisor stated Biological Mother has expressed concern\nthat Youth A is participating in a religion she does not agree with\nand is being coached regarding things to say regarding religion.\nFC Supervisor stated she is aware Youth A has asked questions\nor made certain statements about Christianity during parenting\ntime. Upon learning of Biological Mother’s religious preference, FC\nSupervisor stated there was a discussion between FCW and\nFoster Parent. She stated the Foster Parent are open to sharing\nmaterials and having discussions with Youth A and have started to\nresearch Norse Pagan on their own. FC Supervisor stated now\nthey have a clear understanding of what religious activities\nBiological Mother does not want Youth A to participate in, they will\nhave more conversations with the Foster Parent’s. She stated up\nto this point Biological Mother’s preference were not clear and\ncommunication with her has been more challenging lately.\nFC Supervisor stated Youth A is currently participating in religious\ninstruction or practices that are not based on her religion while in\nher foster placement. Youth A attends a Pre-K program at a\nChristian based school and attends church services with the foster\nfamily on the weekends. She stated they hope to obtain\nclarification from Foster Parent regarding day-to-day religious\nbased activities and practices occurring in the home during the\nmeeting with Licensing Worker.\nFCW was interviewed via telephone on April 18, 2024. She\nstated she was initially made aware of Biological Mother’s\nreligious preference after a court hearing in February. She stated\nit was not discussed at any point prior to that. Once she became\naware she informed Biological Mother she was able to discuss her\nreligion with Youth A and provide religious based activities during\nher parenting time. FCW stated Biological Mother previously made\ncomments stating she was aware Youth A attended a religion-\nbased school and Foster Parents’ beliefs and was approving of\nYouth A being exposed to different religions. She stated she\nprovided that guidance to Biological Mother verbally and in writing.\nThe concerns being reported are new to the agency and has not\nbeen previously expressed.\nFCW stated Foster Parent was in attendance at the court hearing\nin February and is aware of Biological Mother’s religious\npreference. She stated she is scheduled to have a discussion with\nFoster Parents today (April 18, 2024) regarding her religious\npreference.

    "Parents’ religion. FCW stated Youth A prays during meals, reads\nChristian books, and attends church services weekly with the\nfoster family. In addition, she attends a Christian based pre-\nschool. Biological Mother has only recently, within the last 2\nweeks, stated that Youth A is participating in a religion she does\nnot agree with. She sent an email that stated her preferences as\nwell as religious services/activities she did not want Youth A to\nparticipate in.\nFCW stated Biological Mother has reported Youth A has made\ncomments regarding Christianity during parenting time. She stated\nthe agency has a visitation program within their agency who\nsupervise most of the parenting time and submit reports/notes.\nFCW stated she reviewed the visit notes, and it appears when\nreligion was discussed it was due to Biological Mother bringing it\nup.\nDuring the case transfer process, she was provided a 5-day\npacket that included the petition, allegations, placement\ninformation and services Youth A was participating in. She does\nnot recall the CPS investigation report being included in the\ndocumentation that was provided. FCW stated she spoke with the\nCPS worker a few times shortly after Youth A was placed in foster\ncare and does not recall him discussing her religion and does not\nrecall religious preference being discussed at the initial transfer\nmeeting. She stated the agency does not typically inquire about\nbiological family’s religious preference. The first occasion she can\nrecall where it was addressed was during the court hearing in\nFebruary 2024. She stated she inquired to Biological Mother in\nwriting why she had not expressed her religious preference\nsooner.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• FC ISP: 5-day transfer meeting between CPS and FC held\non 9/6/2023.

The\nfoster parents are to support a child's religious and cultural\npractices by demonstrating respect and by providing\naccess to services, ceremonies, and events. Children may\nnot be refused the right to attend the place of worship of\ntheir choice unless there are specific safety concerns.\nFoster parents must receive agency approval prior to a\ndecision to deny access to such activities. Likewise, foster\nparents must not require a foster child to attend church\nservices of the foster parents' choice, nor can they require\nthat a foster child follow specific religious training that is\nadhered to by the foster family.\n8",
    "• FOM 722-08A page 8: For each child included in the case\nservice plan, the caseworker must document and describe\nthe child's religious identity, including:\no Whether the parent or child has identified specific\nreligious preferences or practices.\no The family and child's history of participation in\nreligious practices and desired attendance\nrequirements.\no Description of any special dietary requirements,\ngrooming, dress, or makeup requirements for the\nchild in placement.\n• FOM 722-02 page 1: Services from child placing agencies\nare available to all children, regardless of the religious\norientation of the child or parent.

The agency will attempt to fulfill parental\nwishes whenever possible, while taking into consideration\nthe child's feelings and desires. If there is disagreement\nbetween the parents and child, parental wishes prevail.\nFoster parents/caregivers are expected to take into\nconsideration the child's religious preference, especially\nwhen the child has established a pattern of religious belief\nand practice. Foster parents/caregivers assume the\nresponsibility for providing opportunities for religious\neducation and attendance at religious services in\naccordance with the religious preference of the child and/or\nparent(s).\nChildren may not be refused the right to attend the church\ndenomination of their choice, unless there are specific\nsafety concerns.

    "FCW and FC Supervisor acknowledged Biological Mother’s\nreligious preference were discussed during a court hearing on\nFebruary 14, 2024, and this was not addressed with Foster\nParent, who was also present at the court hearing, until April 18,\n2024, when a licensing complaint was received. The Lenawee\nCounty CMH report also indicated Biological Mothers identified\nreligion.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Development of service plans\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418\nSection • (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents\nDescription and the foster parents in the development of service plans\nto enable the parent or parents and foster parents to\nunderstand the plan for the child and the parents' and the\nfoster parent's role in assisting the agency in carrying out\nthe plan. An agency shall give a copy to and review the\nparent-agency treatment plan with the parent or parents\nand foster parents. The agency must inform the parent or\nparents and foster parent that the information in the parent-\nagency treatment plan and any other information about the\nchild and the child's family is confidential.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The parent is not involved in the development of service plans.\nDocumentation of case planning is not provided when requested\nby parent.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed on April 3, 2024, via telephone.\nShe stated the agency does not review service plans and does not\noffer any assistance to reduce barriers. Biological Mother is told\nwhat services she needs to complete; however, she is not\nprovided a reason behind the service referral and is not involved\nin developing the service plans. Biological Mother has asked for\ndocumentation to be sent to her and was told by FCW that was\nalready provided. It was later determined the agency was sending\ninformation and documentation to an incorrect email.\nBiological mother was interviewed via telephone on April 15,\n2024. She reported FCW will occasionally email her but does not\n10",
    "meet with her. She stated she sends her Parent Agency\nTreatment Plan (PATP) to her but does not review it with her and\nshe is not asked for her input. She said FCW asks for a signature\nto verify it was provided but does not review it and has never been\npart of developing the document. There were occasions when it\nwas presented to her right before her parenting time, and she is\nrushed and pressured to sign it.\nShe stated the initial Parent Agency Treatment Plan (PATP) was\nemailed to her on 10/24/23 but was sent to her ex-boyfriend. It\nwas not sent to her email. She stated she provided her email\naddress multiple times to MDHHS worker. It was not presented to\nher to sign and there was no discussion regarding what was in the\nPATP. She stated there was never a discussion with FCW\nregarding expectations or barriers she needed to address. While\nshe was out of state, FCW never assisted her in locating services\nor resources in the area she lived that would address the barriers\nthat were identified.\nShe stated she has asked FCW multiple times for services and\nresources that would assist with barriers and reunifying with her\ndaughter. She stated she was willing to do whatever she needed\nto do. She specifically asked about parenting classes and housing\nresources.\nBiological Mother stated she asked multiple times for resources,\nprograms, and documentation related to her case to be emailed to\nher and was told it had already been sent. She stated the agency\nhad an incorrect email address for her from the time Youth A was\nremoved until sometime in March.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FC Supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on April 17, 2024. She stated prior to Biological\nMother being court ordered to complete her case service plan she\nand FCW held a Family Team Meeting with Biological Mother via\nZoom on November 8, 2023. The purpose of the meeting was to\nreview the case service plan. During the meeting FCW went\nthrough the case service plan line by line. Biological Mother\nagreed to each item listed. FC Supervisor stated Biological Mother\nhas been provided a copy in a timely manner and signed of all of\nher service plans with each court report. She clarified there have\nbeen 3-4 court hearings up to this point and Biological Mother was\ninvolved with the development of the service plans, was in\nagreement and provided a copy. While Biological Mother was\nresiding out of state her treatment plans were provided via email.\nThey were either sent to her directly or included in the court report\n11",
    "that is dispersed to everyone involved with the hearing. Since\nreturning to Michigan the agency has provided them directly to\nBiological Mother as well as including them in the court report.\nFC Supervisor stated she is not aware of any treatment plans that\nwere sent to an incorrect email address. She stated she was\nmistakenly provided an email address from the referring worker\nwhere her name was switched. A Zoom link was sent to the\nincorrect email. FC Supervisor stated that was a one-time\noccurrence and no personal information was shared in that email.\nFC Supervisor stated Biological Mother fled the state of Michigan\nwhen Youth A entered foster care on September 1, 2023. While\nBiological Mother was out of state she was residing in Kentucky\nand Washington for a period of time. During that time, the agency\nheld a Family Team Meeting via Zoom, Biological Mother\nparticipated in the court hearing via Zoom, and she had\nsupervised parenting time via Zoom. In addition, FCW maintained\ncommunication with her via Facebook Messenger. It was\nchallenging because Biological Mother was only able to connect to\ninternet when she had access to Wi-Fi or a hotspot. FC\nSupervisor stated she and FCW had a conversation with\nBiological Mother regarding the challenges of working toward\nreunification if she is residing so far away from Youth A. FCW\nworked with Biological Mother to make a plan to return to\nMichigan.\nShe stated she was gone for approximately two and a half months\nwhich created a barrier. FC Supervisor stated they did the best\nthey could with providing appropriate service referrals to address\nbarriers while she was residing out of state. When Biological\nMother returned to Michigan the agency provided her\ntransportation from the airport in Detroit and had worked to secure\nher temporary housing at a shelter in Lenawee County. The\ncurrent barrier is centered around Biological Mother’s advocate\nwho, at times, can be adversarial and communication has been\nchallenging. Recently Biological Mother has been deflecting and\nblaming and not admitting she has barriers she needs to work on.\nThe agency made a referral to Housing Help with Lenawee. She\nwas engaged with services through Community Mental Health\n(CMH) but has since discontinued those services. Youth A has\nbeen participating in services through CMH and Biological Mother\nwas invited to participate in those services. The agency has made\na couple other referrals. FC Supervisor stated all service referrals\nhave been completed timely.\n12",
    "Foster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nApril 18, 2024. She stated when Youth A was initially removed\nBiological Mother left the state for approximately 1-2 months. The\ninitial meeting was held via Zoom, and she reviewed the case\nservice plan in detail with Biological Mother. She stated the\nmeeting lasted approximately 2 hours. She stated another case\nservice plan was reviewed in February where Biological Mother\nsigned it after it was reviewed, and this was provided to the court.\nShe stated she has always reviewed the case service plans in\ndetail and made herself available in case there were any\nquestions. Appropriate service referrals were made to address the\nbarriers and they were made in a timely manner.\nFCW stated Biological Mother initially went to Tennessee and then\nto Washington shortly after. She stated it was difficult to develop a\nservice plan for Biological Mother due to her residing out of state.\nWhile she was out of state, FCW did not have her specific address\nor even a general location. Biological Mother expressed fear and\nconcern that her abusive ex-boyfriend would be able to locate her,\nso she was guarded with what information she provided. FCW\nwas unable to make any service referrals due to not knowing her\nlocation. While Biological Mother was out of state FCW\nmaintained contact and she was provided parenting time via\nZoom. FCW made arrangements for a spot at the homeless\nshelter when she came back to Michigan. Currently, there are\nbarriers regarding her advocates and the communication.\nCopies of case service plans were provided in-person, via email\nand/or through Facebook Messenger. FCW clarified that\ncommunication is mainly through Facebook Messenger. She\nstated she did not provide case service plans through email.\nThere was one occasion when she provided an incorrect email\naddress to her supervisor, but the mistake was realized quickly\nand corrected, and no confidential information was sent.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• 9/12/2023 text message between CPS and Biological\nMother: CPS states FCW said you are staying in Kentucky\nright now.

    "• b) Facilitating services and parenting time for\nchildren for purposes of reunification.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency is not working towards reunification with parent.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed on April 3, 2024, via telephone.\nShe stated the agency has not assisted Biological Mother with\nreducing barriers that would allow reunification to occur. One of\nthe primary barriers identified by the agency is housing and\ninstability. When Biological Mother returned to Michigan after\nYouth A was removed, she was residing in a homeless shelter.\nShe did not have an address, ID or birth certificate but agency told\nher she needed those things in order to obtain housing and did not\nassist with appropriate service referrals or work with her to obtain\nthe necessary documents. Complainant stated she assisted, and it\ntook one week. Biological Mother secured housing at the\nbeginning of February and the agency has not completed a home\nvisit in order to assess safety and appropriateness. She notified\nthe agency she is living with a roommate and has provided the\nagency with the roommate’s information in order for clearances to\nbe completed and that has not been done.\nBiological Mother has consistently participated in parenting time\nwith no concerns noted. The agency will not increase visitation. In\naddition, Biological Mother has requested community visits and\nsupervised visits in her home and those have not occurred. All of\nthe visitation is required to take place at the agency.\nComplainant stated Biological Mother was referred to a Christian\nbased parenting class (TIPS). She was instructed to watch a video\nand then hand in her packet when it was completed. Biological\nMother reported to FCW she was struggling with the parenting\nclass because it was challenging. At this point she has\nsuccessfully completed two parenting classes and the agency is\nasking her to complete another one. A recommendation was\nmade for Biological Mother and Youth A to complete a bonding\nassessment. She completed the assessment in February 2024.\nBiological mother was interviewed via telephone on April 15,\n2024. She reported she left Michigan approximately 5 days after\nYouth A was removed from her care. She stated she reported to\nthe CPS worker where she was going and what her plan was. She\nreturned to Michigan during the first or second week of November\n2023. While she was out of state, she never had a FCW from the\n15",
    "other state visit her. FCW did not make any referrals for services\nor programs in the area she was residing.\nWhen she returned to Michigan, she stayed at Share the Warmth\nShelter. She stayed there for a few months. During that time, FCW\nnever conducted a home visit while she resided there. She never\nprovided any referrals or assistance to address housing. She\nstated she was made to do it on her own. Biological Mother stated\nshe did not have an ID, birth certificate, employment, an address\nto list on an application or any support or knowledge to obtain the\nitems she would need to secure housing. FCW did not assist in\nany way to address these barriers. Biological Mother stated she\nhas resided in her current location since February 1, 2024. She\nstated FCW has picked her up on one occasion and dropped her\noff, but she has never conducted a home visit. Biological Mother\nstated she offered to show FCW her home when she was dropped\noff, but FCW did not want to go inside. She stated FCW has never\nmade any attempt to verify her housing and determine whether or\nnot it is appropriate and has never inquired about her housing\nsituation. She stated she has a bedroom set up for Youth A and is\nnot allowed to show her pictures during parenting time.\nBiological Mother stated FCW is aware she has a roommate and\nstated this in some of the court documents as well as her\npsychological evaluation. It was also mentioned during the\nFebruary 14, 2024, court hearing, however she has only recently\nasked for her roommate’s information in order to conduct\nclearances. Biological Mother stated in the email, agency made it\nsound as though they were just made aware of mom’s living\narrangement, but FCW has known about her housing status for a\nfew months and never made any attempt to inquire or verify\nanything related to her current housing situation.\nBiological Mother stated FCW insisted on speaking to employers\nwhere she had applied but not been hired. FCW has asked\nBiological Mother for verification of her employment status.\nBiological Mother stated there was a time she struggled to obtain\nthe verification due to issues with accessing the information. She\nstated she informed FCW about the barriers she had to obtain\nemployment verification and she never offered to assist her.\nBiological Mother stated FCW contacted her supervisor at one\npoint, so she is aware of her employer.\nBiological Mother was referred to one parenting class called TIPS.\nShe stated she successfully completed the class and provided\nFCW with verification. She was recently (on 4/12/24) referred to\n16",
    "another parenting class even though the court documents state\nshe only needed to complete one. She stated an additional\nconcern is one of the classes FCW wants her to complete is\nChristian based and she is not comfortable with that. She stated\nFCW should be able to refer her to a class that is not Christian\nrelated. She stated FCW has not provided any communication\nregarding the reason for being referred to additional parenting\nclasses and why there has been such a lengthy delay with the\nmost recent referral, and she is ignored when she asks about it.\nA recommendation was made for Biological Mother and Youth A\nto participate in attachment therapy. The recommendation was\nmade on January 16, 2024. Biological Mother states she had\nattempted to start therapy and received a phone call from Youth\nA’s therapist indicating they were not going to start this service at\nthis time and did not provide a reason. She is not aware if FCW\nmade a referral so she could get started.\nBiological Mother stated she consistently attends parenting time.\nAt one point, she tried to show Youth A appropriate videos\nregarding her religion during parenting time. The video was about\nThor sacrificing a goat for a meal and then being resurrected the\nnext morning showing them as uninjured.\nBiological Mother stated she is not provided feedback on how she\nis doing or regarding services she has completed. She stated she\nhas repeatedly asked FCW how she could improve or if there is\nanything else she could be doing.\nFC Supervisor was interviewed via telephone on April 17,\n2024. She stated the primary barriers at case opening was a\npattern of lack of appropriate housing, instability, and transience.\nBiological Mother has moved to approximately 10 states over a 2-\nyear period. There was concern regarding Youth A’s previous\nexposure to inappropriate things or people. She was previously in\nfoster care in 2021 in Washington and the reasons for removal\nwere similar to the current concerns in Michigan.\nThe agency did the best they could to engage mom and seek\nservices to address barriers while she was out of state. They\nincluded her in FTM’s and parenting time was conducted virtually\nbut it was difficult due to not knowing her exact location and how\nlong she indicated on staying in one place. Upon leaving\nMichigan, Biological Mother moved to Kentucky. FC Supervisor\nstated the agency did not know where she was residing and\nclarified that Biological Mother would not disclose the county\n17",
    "where she was residing. She stated Biological Mother is not\nalways forthcoming with information.\nWhen Biological Mother returned to Michigan the agency located\na homeless shelter for her to stay and connected her with local\nresources to assist with housing. FC Supervisor stated some\nbarriers to obtain housing included not having an ID (her advocate\nassisted her with this) and her overall history of housing instability.\nBiological Mother recently obtained housing with an individual she\nhas met within the past 2 months. FC Supervisor stated a home\nvisit has not been completed to assess Biological Mother’s\nresidence. She stated there has been concern due to recent\nallegations that have been made and communication lately has\nbeen uncomfortable. The agency will have 2-3 workers attend the\nhome visit once it is scheduled since they anticipate roommate will\nbe there along with Biological Mother’s advocate.\nFC Supervisor stated they have informed Biological Mother they\nwill need to run clearances on her roommates. They recently\nobtained releases and have not completed the clearances. There\nwas a delay due to roommate refusing to sign a release.\nBiological Mother has recently successfully completed online\nparenting classes. The agency planned on referring her to an in-\nperson parenting support program where the provider supervises\none parenting time per week and provides support and education.\nThe concern is that the online parenting classes are being\ncompleted with help of Biological Mother’s advocate.\nA recommendation was made for Youth A and Biological Mother\nto attend attachment therapy. Youth A has been receiving\nservices through CMH and participating in EMDR and the\nintention was to involve Biological Mother in those services to\nwork on their relationship and their bond. The idea was Youth A\nwould attend one week and Biological Mother the next week until\nthe therapist felt it would be beneficial to bring them together for\nsessions. Biological Mother attended one session and FC\nSupervisor did not believe she likes the EMDR modality based on\nstatements made by advocate and Biological Mother. The agency\nrecently made a referral for attachment therapy with a different\nprovider.\nBiological Mother attends parenting time consistently. The only\nconcerns during parenting time have been some of the video’s\nmom has shown Youth A where it displays animals being killed.\nThey want to ensure the videos shown are age appropriate. On\nanother occasion, Biological Mother played a video with a man\n18",
    "who referred to himself as “Daddy” and Youth A referred to him as\n“Daddy”. FC Supervisor stated overall there are no concerns\nregarding parenting time. Currently the court order states\nparenting time needs to be supervised. The agency has done\ncommunity visits when requested. Due to recent allegations from\nAdvocate the agency is doubling staff as a precaution. The\nagency is not comfortable with Advocate’s adversarial approach.\nIn addition, she will sit in the parking lot staring at staff which\nmakes them uncomfortable. This has been difficult to coordinate\nfor community visits. There was one occasion where Biological\nMother inquired about a parenting time visit in the community to\nparticipate in a program with Youth A. FC Supervisor stated she\nleft on vacation a few days later and did not have the opportunity\nto speak with FCW and respond to Biological Mother. She stated\ncommunity visits are offered on a case-by-case basis. They have\nbeen discussing doing parenting time visits in the park but\nreiterated they will need to double staff the visits due to concerns.\nThere have been concerns with Biological Mother’s Roommate\nand Advocate who often sit in the parking lot and stare at staff\nduring parenting time. In addition, Advocate has made several\nsevere allegations toward the agency. Advocate and Roommate\ndo provide transportation for Biological Mother.\nThe Advocate has been involved since sometime in February. She\ninitially called FCW from Biological Mother’s phone and was\nadvocating for her very intensely but would not provide her name.\nDuring the call the Advocate asked to speak with FC Supervisor.\nFC Supervisor informed her that she could not provide case\ndetails with her unless she knew who she was and had a release\non file. She would not provide her name until a Family Team\nMeeting was held. Advocate has been communicating for\nBiological Mother through Biological Mother’s email and Facebook\nMessenger as some previous messages stated Advocates name,\nbut this is no longer occurring. However, based on the tone of the\nemails/messages, it is suspected that this may have continued.\nFC Supervisor stated she feels appropriate referrals have been\nmade to address Biological Mother’s barriers and they were made\nin a timely manner. FC Supervisor stated the agency is working\ntoward reunification. That is stated during court hearings.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nApril 18, 2024. She stated the concerns at the time Youth A was\nremoved was transience and instability. FCW stated Biological\nMother had left Michigan shortly after Youth A was removed but\nhad made it clear her intention was to return to Michigan to work\n19",
    "on her case service plan. Biological Mother returned\napproximately a month and a half later and the agency had put\neffort into assisting her with returning to Michigan. FCW stated the\nagency arranged for her to have a bed at a local homeless shelter\nupon arrival in Michigan and for transportation from Detroit Metro\nAirport to the homeless shelter.\nFCW stated the agency made appropriate and timely referrals to\naddress the identified barriers and active efforts have been made\nto work toward reunification once Biological Mother returned to\nMichigan. A referral to CMH was made and Biological Mother had\nengaged with the service initially. Another referral was made for\nEMDR parenting attachment therapy for Youth A; however\nBiological Mother did not follow through on that service. FCW\nreferred her to a Trauma Informed Parenting course that was not\ncompleted until after her Advocate became involved. FCW\nprovided transportation to and from her trauma assessment and\npsychological evaluation. FCW secured a spot for Biological\nMother in the homeless shelter when she returned to Michigan\nand the shelter assisted her with housing resources in the\ncommunity. FCW also advised her to reach out to Housing Help.\nBiological Mother stayed in the homeless shelter for approximately\ntwo months after returning to Michigan. During that time, she also\nworked to obtain employment on her own and FCW felt the case\nprogression was moving in the right direction. FCW stated she\nwas not aware that Biological Mother did not have an identification\nsince she was able to board an airplane to come back to\nMichigan. She stated she would have assisted with that if she had\nknown. She stated she reached out multiple times and informed\nBiological Mother to let her know anything she could assist her\nwith.\nBiological Mother obtained her current housing around the time of\nthe court hearing in mid-February. FCW stated a home visit has\nnot been completed in order to complete an assessment on her\nhousing. She stated she discussed with her to engage with\nservices and then a home visit could be completed. Since that\ntime there has been a lot of contention with Biological Mother and\nher Advocate, and she does not feel safe conducting a home visit\nalone due to advocate’s adversarial tone and behavior, behavior\nincludes Advocate’s line of questioning to agency staff and staring\nat staff. FCW believes Biological Mother has one roommate. She\ninformed her that she will need to run a clearance on him and\nasked for his ID. She could not recall the date she asked for the ID\nand stated she has not received it.\n20",
    "Biological Mother has been referred to two online parenting\nclasses and successfully completed those. FCW is in the process\nof referring her to an in-person parenting class. There is suspicion\nthat her Advocate may have completed the material and not\nBiological Mother. There have been numerous occasions where\nthe Advocate communicates with the agency via Biological\nMother’s email or text. She clarified there is a notation at the\nbottom of the email that had stated these are Biological Mother’s\nwords but transcribed by her Advocate. FCW stated she asked\nBiological Mother for an update on the Trauma Informed Parenting\nand was told she had not started it, but had it completed one week\nlater with notes written on the side. FCW did not indicate these\nconcerns were discussed with Biological Mother.\nYouth A participated in a trauma assessment and\nrecommendations were provided to the agency in late January.\nPart of the recommendations included Youth A and Biological\nMother attend attachment therapy. Youth A is participating in\nservices through CMH, and her counselor had advised FCW in\nFebruary that she could incorporate Biological Mother into the\nservices to conduct attachment therapy. The counselor would see\nYouth A and Biological Mother on alternate weeks separately until\nit was determined to be appropriate to have them both attend\ntogether. FCW stated that Biological Mother was informed of the\nplan for attachment therapy by the court hearing on February 14,\n2024, and had agreed to participate but did not follow through with\nthe service. Recently she is reporting the agency never provided a\nreferral for attachment therapy, but FCW clarified a referral was\nmade but Biological Mother did not show up. A new referral was\nmade on April 12, 2024, for attachment therapy with a different\nservice provider.\nFCW stated Biological Mother has consistently attended parenting\ntime. She stated there have not been any significant concerns.\nParenting time was increased at the most recent court hearing on\nFebruary 14, 2024. Initially she was provided one hour per week\nand that was increased to two hours per week. Biological Mother\nhas requested increased parenting time and community visits.\nFCW stated community visits have occurred at the library, the\npark and walked to get ice cream. She stated interactions have\nbecome very contentious recently and have made communication\nmore difficult.\nFCW stated Biological Mother initially provided verification she\nhad obtained employment in January 2024. She did not report to\nFCW any barriers she had in obtaining the requested verification.\n21",
    "FCW stated she is able to accept several forms of verification and\nwould have accommodated this if she had known Biological\nMother had difficulty accessing her paystubs.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n• 2/2/2024 text message from Biological Mother to FCW:\nBiological Mother states “I found a safe place that was\nstable outside of the shelter. I will be giving you the\naddress and the information to the person that is helping\nme with a place to stay”. She then provides the address to\nFCW.

Diagnostic\nimpressions included: Other Specified Trauma and Stressor-\nRelated Disorder; Child Neglect; and Mixed Personality\nDisorder features. Recommendations include supervised\nvisitation that increases as she progresses on her Case\nService Plan, individual therapy, daily journaling, and task\nlists, obtaining housing, her driver’s license, and a healthy\nsupport network, therapy pertaining to abuse and neglect,\nand parent education. Parenting skills: During this reporting\nperiod, Biological Mother has been provided with supervised\nparenting time with Youth A at least two times per week, and\nshe has consistently participated in her scheduled visits.\nTypically, Biological Mother appears to interact with Youth A\n27",
    "appropriately during the visits, although there are times when\ntopics assessed as inappropriate are discussed and\nredirected. Biological Mother overall instability is of concern\nas it relates to her ability to manage Youth A’s needs and\nservice providers on her own. Biological Mother will be\nreferred for parent education in the next reporting period.\nResource availability/management: Biological Mother\nrecently secured employment in Adrian, MI, and she provided\nverification of this employment on 01/23/2024. Biological\nMother had stayed at Share the Warmth shelter for most of\nthis reporting period but reported moving in with a friend on\n02/02/2024. This area will continue to be monitored.\nCommunication/interpersonal skills: During this reporting\nperiod, Biological Mother has demonstrated more limited\ncommunication skills and has utilized her Advocate to\nadvocate and communicate for her. This is of concern as\nAdvocate’s communication with the caseworker, supervisor,\nand Court personnel has been observed as adversarial at\ntimes. Appropriate, effective communication skills will be\ndiscussed with Biological Mother and her support people\nduring the next reporting period in order to work toward\nreunification as a team. There is a case service for\ncounseling linked to emotional stability behavior, case service\nfor psychological evaluation linked to resource\navailability/management which are not related in any way,\ncase service psychological evaluation and counseling linked\nto parenting skills and there are no case services linked for\ncommunication/interpersonal skills.\nAnalysis The agency is found to be in noncompliance. The primary reasons\nYouth A was removed from Biological Mother are history of\ntransience, no financial means to provide, and not able to meet\nYouth A’s medical and mental health needs. The FANS\nassessment completed on 3/1/2024 indicated the following\nbarriers: resource availability/management, emotional stability\nbehavior, parenting skills and communication/interpersonal skills.\nBiological Mother has been employed part-time since January\n2024. She secured housing in February 2024 and the agency has\nnot conducted a home visit to determine appropriateness.\nInformation was not requested of her roommate in order to run\nclearances until mid-April 2024.\nBiological Mother participated in a psychological evaluation and\nwas attending sessions with CMH but requested a new provider.\nShe established care with a new provider mid-March 2024.\n28",
    "The Updated Service Plan dated 3/27/2024 indicates in order to\nexpand the frequency and/or duration of parenting time Biological\nMother will need to demonstrate sustained safe housing and\nemployment, engagement in and benefit from mental health\nservices, and appropriate parenting skills and stable behavior\nduring visits. Biological Mother has participated in almost all of the\nparenting time scheduled. She has repeatedly requested\ncommunity visits with Youth A and, for the most part, that has not\noccurred despite few concerns during parenting time and the\nlength of time the case has been open (approximately 10 months).\nThere are 88 social work contacts entered for parenting time and\nout of those, 3 parenting times were missed. Based on review of\nYouth A's MISACWIS case file, Biological Mother was referred to\none parenting class. However, based on completed interviews she\nhas completed two parenting classes and was being referred to a\nthird parenting class due to suspicion her advocate had completed\nthe second one and there is no indication this concern was\naddressed with Biological Mother.\nCommunication/interpersonal skills was not previously listed as a\nconcern but is now due to adversarial communication from\nBiological Mother’s advocate. Although, this concern needed to be\naddressed with Advocate, the agency cited another individual’s\nbehavior as a reason to add this as a need for Biological Mother\nwhich impacts reunification.\nYouth A has attended several medical and mental health related\nappointments; however, the majority of the appointments are not\nentered in her MISACWIS case file. Based on the information\ngathered during interviews and review of social work contacts and\ntext messages between FCW and Biological Mother it is evident\nBiological Mother was not informed of all medical and mental\nhealth appointments. In order for Biological Mother to show she\ncan manage Youth A’s medical and mental health needs it is\nimperative she is a part of all appointments and discussions.\nThe agency is required to provide active efforts toward\nreunification and there is not documentation in Youth A’s\nMISACWIS case file to determine that has occurred. Biological\nMother has reported several barriers throughout the duration of\nthe case including transportation, housing, lack of a valid ID,\nlimited communication capability unless connected to Wi-Fi and\nvery few resources/referrals were offered to assist her toward\nreunification with Youth A. Despite this, in the 10 months since\nYouth A entered care, Biological Mother has made progress\n29",
    "towards the needs listed in her treatment plan however\nreunification efforts and case progression have not matched her\nprogress.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection • (3) An agency shall facilitate in-person contact between\nDescription parents and children except where parental rights have\nbeen terminated or when there is a court determination that\nvisits are detrimental to the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency reduces parenting time in retaliation when parent raises\nconcerns.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed on April 3, 2024, via telephone.\nShe stated Biological Mother was threatened with reduction of\nparenting time. It was eliminated in the past for something minor.\nShe arrives on time and sometimes the agency is late, or Foster\nParent is late but that’s ok. Biological Mother was told if she is 2-4\nminutes late, she will lose parenting time.\nComplainant stated the agency asked Biological Mother to sign a\nform giving permission for Foster Parent to take child out of state.\nShe informed FCW she did not want to sign because she wanted\nto see Youth A at Christmas and agency told her she did not have\na choice. Agency used the form for Christmas as a blanket\npermission for future travel (Easter). Visitation during Easter was\non face time and Biological Mother was not given reason despite a\ncourt order that states visitation is supposed to be in person.\nBiological Mother wrote a document that stated in the future she\nwants to be informed and be able to know where Youth A is going\nand why and approve on a case-by-case basis. She revoked her\nprior approval that agency was using as a blanket approval for\ntravel. Agency said that was fine, they will go to the judge and\nobtain an ex parte court order.\n30",
    "Biological Mother’s visitation has not increased despite no\nviolations regarding parenting. Court order says parenting time\nshould be increased over time and it’s been 9 months with no\nincrease. Biological Mother has requested community visits and is\ntold no. FCW needs to be notified ahead of time and even when\nshe requests ahead of time, she’s told no.\nYouth A is excited to see Biological Mother and is sad when\nparenting time ends. She is not allowed to share pictures of her\nfamily or take pictures of herself with Youth A. She is not allowed\nto have phone in visits because it’s not part of her parenting plan.\nShe also used it to show videos to child of her religion. She had\nEaster eggs and a bunny for Easter and asked if she could take a\npicture and was told no. She asked if agency could take a picture\nand they said no.\nBiological mother was interviewed via telephone on April 15,\n2024. She stated she confirmed her parenting time recently and\nasked if she could take Youth A for a walk and get ice cream after\nthey ate dinner since the weather was supposed to be nice.\nAgency responded and said they need to make sure there is staff\navailable so visitation worker can go.\nBiological Mother stated she is required to confirm her visit by\n11:00am on the day of the visit. If she does not confirm, her visit is\ncancelled. She stated she does not recall being provided anything\nin writing that outlines these policies/requirements. Biological\nMother stated this is a barrier due to the time she is at work and\nthe nature of her job. She clarified she is employed at a restaurant\nand is not supposed to be on her phone and is usually too busy\nanyway. She stated she asked FCW to revise the requirements for\nconfirming her parenting time due to the barriers she has and was\ntold that was not an option. She specifically asked if she could\nconfirm her visits the night before and was told no.\nBiological Mother stated she arrives early to her parenting time\nand is made to wait outside even when the weather is cold. Her\nroommate sits across the street because Biological Mother has\ntold him she does not feel safe. He sits in his vehicle, he does not\nrecord or take pictures, and he does not speak with anyone. She\nwas told she cannot sit in her roommate’s vehicle in the parking lot\nwaiting for Youth A to arrive because she was told he looks\nthreatening. She stated Foster Parent made comments to FCW in\nfront of her and said she does not feel safe around Roommate.\nBiological Mother stated she has tried to bring activities that she\n31",
    "can complete with Youth A during her parenting time and is told\nshe cannot do them.\nBiological Mother stated she has asked FCW on April 12, 2024, if\nshe could do a supervised parenting time in her home. She was\ntold it was something they could work towards, but they plan to\nkeep the visits at the agency for the time being.\nBiological Mother stated FCW has never brought up increasing\nher parenting time. She stated she has asked and was told no.\nBiological Mother stated she has asked FCW for community\nparenting time visits many times and has been told no. She states\nshe has asked to go to the park and was told no. She stated now\nshe is being told she needs to email them ahead of time when\nmaking a request for community visits and is told they need to\nmake sure they have staff available. Biological Mother stated this\ndoes not make sense to her. She stated she has been compliant\nand appropriate during parenting time and an additional staff\nmember would not be necessary. Biological Mother stated she\nrequested to take Youth A for a walk during her parenting time on\n4/15/24 and was told no. A few weeks ago she asked to take\nYouth A for a walk during her parenting time and was told she\nneeded to ask ahead of time. There was additional\ncorrespondence from FCW that stated she could take Youth A for\na walk during parenting time if it was during the day. Biological\nMother stated she is told different things at different times. She\nstated she found an activity for her and Youth A to do and asked\nfor a community visit in advance and did not receive a response.\nBiological Mother stated she requested permission via email on\n3/28/2024 and the event was 4/10/2024 and she did not receive a\nresponse. She provided information about the event to the agency\nas well. She stated FCW has never brought up community visits\nwithout Biological Mother asking first. Biological Mother stated she\nis fearful that her parenting time will be reduced or suspended if\nshe presses the issue anymore. She stated there has been\noccasions where she is presented with documentation prior to her\nparenting time or at the end of her parenting time. She stated she\nwas told by FCW her parenting time would be reduced or\nsuspended if she questions the document or refuses to sign, dates\nwere unable to be provided.\nBiological Mother stated Youth A was in Florida with Foster\nParents for three weeks over Christmas. She stated she was\nprovided video visits. She stated she was not provided video visits\nfor all of the face-to-face visits she missed.\n32",
    "Biological Mother stated she is not permitted to have her phone\nduring visits. She is not allowed to take pictures of Youth A or with\nYouth A. Youth A has come to parenting time with bruises on\nnumerous occasions and she is not allowed to take pictures.\nBiological Mother stated she was allowed to take a walk with\nYouth A during a parenting time to get ice cream recently and did\nnot have her wallet because her money is part of her phone case\nand FCW makes her turn in her phone before the visits start.\nBiological Mother stated Youth A loves listening to music and\ndancing and she cannot do that because she is not allowed to\nhave her phone. She stated she does not recall being provided a\ndocument that states she is not allowed to have her phone but\nwas told she cannot have it during her visits.\nBiological Mother stated the only concerns regarding her\nparenting time she was told about is the video she has shown to\nYouth A regarding her religion. She stated that happened at one\nvisit and the video was age appropriate. Biological Mother stated\nshe has a few family members (fictive kin) that made a video with\nencouraging words for Youth A, and Biological Mother showed\nher. Agency told her that she should not be showing these videos\nduring parenting time.\nFC Supervisor was interviewed via telephone on April 17,\n2024. She stated the agency provides parents with written\nrequirements and guidelines for parenting time. In addition, the\nexpectations are included in the court reports. The expectation of\nconfirming parenting time is typically provided in writing however\nsince Biological Mother was residing out of state at the beginning\nof the case, she is not aware if those expectations were provided\nverbally or in writing.\nBiological Mother has never had her parenting time reduced at\nany point and she was never told her parenting time would be\nreduced or suspended in response to concerns she raised. Any\nmissed parenting time is made up or alternative methods are\nprovided, such as Zoom.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nApril 18, 2024. She stated the expectations for parenting time is\nin the visitation plan that is included at the bottom of the case\nservice plans. Confirmation of visits is required and verbally\ndiscussed with clients.\nFCW stated Biological Mother has had good attendance with her\nparenting time with no significant concerns. Her parenting time\n33",
    "has never been reduced at any point and she was never told\nparenting time could be reduced or suspended in response to\nconcerns she raised.\nFCW stated Youth A was out of town with Foster Parents over\nChristmas and arrangements were made for Biological Mother to\nhave parenting time via Zoom. All visits Biological Mother was\nscheduled to have occurred while Youth A was out of town.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Fostering Solutions agency policy: Parenting Time: An\nagency shall develop a plan of visitation and family time for\neach child in foster care consistent with the child’s service\nplans, as required by R 400.12419 and R 400.12420 to\nensure the safety and wellbeing of the child. The Agency\nshall facilitate in-person contact between parents and\nchildren except where parental rights have been terminated\nor when there is a court determination that visits are\ndetrimental to the child.\nThe Agency recognizes the critical importance of ensuring that\nparenting time occurs between children in foster care and their\nbiological parents, and the Agency will make all reasonable\nefforts to ensure that visitation occurs. The Frequency of\nparenting time must occur as indicated below:\n• Newborn through age two: visits occur, at a minimum, two\ntimes per week.\n• Ages three through five: visits occur, at a minimum, two\ntimes per week.\n• Ages six and older: visits occur, at a minimum, once per\nweek.\n• For sibling groups, the number of required visits is\ndetermined by the youngest child age.\n• Parenting time must not be reduced solely due to a child\nturning a year older.\nAs it pertains to the duration or length of the actual parenting\ntime, visits should be long enough to promote parent-child\nattachment and should occur in a family friendly setting\nconducive to normal interaction between the child and parent.\nIf visits are not occurring as outlined above, the barriers or\nfactors contributing to less frequent visits must be addressed\nin the Case Service Plan.\nParenting time social work contacts: 9/12/2023, 9/14/2023,\n9/21/2023, 9/26/2023-Zoom, 9/28/2023, 10/3/2023, 10/5/2023,\n34",

Biological Mother had no say regarding Youth A getting leg\nbraces or EDMR therapy.\nBiological mother was interviewed via telephone on April 15,\n2024. She stated she is not informed about the majority of Youth\nA’s appointments and when she is notified, she is not provided\nample time to secure transportation and let her employer know\nshe needs the time off. She stated there are situations where she\nis told about an appointment but is not told what the appointments\nare for. She stated the agency does not offer any assistance with\ntransportation other than an IEP meeting with Youth A’s school.\nYouth A has physical therapy. She stated she was not aware\nYouth A was doing this until a school meeting where foster parent\ndisclosed it. FCW informed her Youth A was given leg braces, but\nshe did not provide an explanation for why that was being done or\nhow that decision was made. She was also not informed of the\nappointment where those reasons were discussed.
