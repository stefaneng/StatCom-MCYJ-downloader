    "(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 3 allegedly strangled Youth A. There are no reported injuries\nnor visible injuries.\nInvestigation On 8/26/24 I left a voicemail for Complainant. A return call was\nreceived, and no new information was provided.\nOn 8/26/24, I spoke to Adoption Worker. Adoption Worker\nreported she saw Youth A on 8/24/24 and did not see any marks\nor bruises on Youth A.\nOn 8/26/24, I spoke to Administrator. No new information was\nprovided.\nThe alleged incident occurred on 8/24/24. All interviews were\nconducted face to face at the facility unless otherwise noted.\nStaff 1 reported he was in his office when he heard Youth A\nscreaming in the lobby area. Staff 1 reported when he entered the\nlobby area, Staff 2 and Staff 3 had their hands on Youth A’s arms\nand shoulders attempting to have him sit down. Staff 1 asked\nthem to let Youth A go, and they did. Staff 1 was hoping to be able\nto deescalate Youth A verbally because he felt he had a good\nrelationship with Youth A. Once they let Youth A go, Youth A\npunched Staff 2. Staff 1 reported he got in between Youth A and\nStaff 2. Staff 1 told Staff 2 to leave the area so Youth A would not\nattempt to attack him again. Staff 3 then grabbed Youth A by the\ncollar of his shirt and pushed Youth A into a nearby chair. (This\nchair had wheels on it). Staff 1 reported Staff 3 was yelling at\nYouth A. Staff 1 was unable to remember what was yelled. Staff 1\nasked Staff 3 to let go and he did. Staff 3 then left the room. Youth\nA was no longer escalated at this point. Staff 1 reported Youth A\ndid have red marks on his neck area due to the collar of his shirt\nrubbing against him. Staff 1 reported Staff 3 did not choke Youth A\nbut did grab his shirt.\nStaff 2 reported he was in the lobby area with Youth A and Staff\n3. Youth A was escalated and kicking doors and walls. Youth A\nkicked him in the private area and then went to pull the fire alarm.\nStaff 2 reported he stopped Youth A by wrapping his arms around\nhim and moving him from the alarm. While moving him, they lost\ntheir balance and began to fall. Staff 2 reported he did not fall the\n2",
    "entire way but did have Youth A still in his grasp. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 entered the lobby and told him to let Youth A go. Once he\nlet him go, Staff 2 reported Youth A began punching him in the\nface and head. Staff 2 reported “they” pulled Youth A off of him\nand he did see Staff 3 grab Youth A by the shirt to remove him.\nWhen Staff 3 moved him, he turned him and placed him in the\nchair. Staff 3 did not state that he pushed him into the chair, only\nthat he placed him in the chair. Staff 2 reported he did not see\nStaff 3 choke Youth A. Staff 2 reported he did not hear any staff\nthreaten Youth A during this time. Staff 2 reported he did not see\nany marks on Youth A nor did Youth A verbalize he was hurt.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via telephone on 9/10/24. Staff 3 reported\nYouth A was kicking on doors because he was told “no”. Youth A\nattempted to get into the chapel area and Staff 3 verbally\nredirected him and Youth A then attempted to punch him in the\nface. Staff 3 reported he blocked the punch. Staff 3 reported Staff\n2 was present. Staff 3 reported Youth A went to pull the fire alarm\nand Staff 2 followed him, verbally redirected him and then grabbed\nhis arms from behind. Staff 3 reported he attempted to come over\nand help Staff 2, but Youth A was punching and kicking. Staff 1\nthen came into the area and told Staff 2 to release Youth A. When\nhe did, Youth A started to punch Staff 2 four to five times. Staff 3\nreported he then went to grab Youth A’s arm but grabbed the\ncollar of his hoodie instead, this turned Youth A around and Youth\nA kicked him in the groin area. Because he had him by the\nsweatshirt, he pushed Youth A forward and Youth A went into the\nnearby chair. Staff 3 reported he had both hands on his\nsweatshirt, holding on to him so they both didn’t fall to the floor.\nYouth A then punched Staff 3 in the face and knocked his glasses\noff. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 told him to let him go and he did. Staff\n3 reported he never choked Youth A but did accidently grab his\nsweatshirt collar.\nYouth A reported he was placed in an “illegal restraint.” Youth A\nreported Staff 2 and Staff 3 were twisting his arm and hitting him.\nYouth A reported he could not remember what was going on\nbefore this happened. Youth A reported Staff 2 and Staff 3\nattempted to restrain him and then ended up placing him in a\nchair. Youth A did not report he was forced in the chair only that\ntheir attempted restraint wound up placing him in a chair. Youth A\nreported he was choked by Staff 3. Youth A reported Staff 3’s\nhand was wrapped around his neck. Youth A reported Staff 1\ncame in and told Staff 3 to leave and he did. Youth A reported he\nhad marks near his neck.\n3",
    "Video Reviewed:\nI watched the video dated 8/24/24 from 6:06pm-6:10pm. Youth A\nwas visibly upset. He was kicking doors and walls. This went on\nuntil 6:08pm where Youth A attempted to pull the fire alarm. Staff\n2 placed his hand over the fire alarm and was bit by Youth A. Staff\n2 then bear hugged Youth A and pulled him away from the fire\nalarm. Staff 3 then engaged and attempted to grab Youth A’s arm.\nYouth A was struggling during this. Staff 2 was heard saying, “Are\nyou going to hit me again?” Staff 3 was no longer holding Youth A.\nBoth Staff 2 and Youth A began to go towards the ground. Staff 1\ngoes down to one knee, but still has Youth A’s arm. Staff 1\nentered the area and said, “release him.” Staff 2 released him and\nYouth A then punched Staff 2 in the face and head area. Staff 3\nthen grabbed Youth A by the back of the shirt (upper arm/shoulder\narea) and moved him appropriately into the chair. Youth A\npunched Staff 3 in the face and his glasses fall off. Staff 3 is still\nholding onto Youth A’s left arm and right shoulder and bunches up\nthe sweatshirt. Staff 3 pushed the chair. Staff 1 told Staff 3 to\ndisengage and Staff 3 did not listen. Staff 3 then yelled at Youth A,\n“Try it again!” Staff 1 removed Staff 3’s hands from Youth A’s shirt\nand then Staff 3 left.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Medical documents were not completed after this restraint.\nStaff had assessed there were no injuries via incident\nreport.\n• Personnel files for Staff 2 and Staff 3. Both were up to date\nwith training. Neither had disciplinary action in their files.\n• Incident Report dated 8/24/24 was consistent with both\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 interviews. The video did not clearly\nshow Staff 3 being hit in the groin area, but this was\nrecorded on the incident report.\n• I reviewed the behavior management policy which is\nconsistent with the rules and prohibits any type of physical\npunishment.\nAnalysis The agency is in violation of this rule, but not due to the\nallegations of Staff 3 choking Youth A. Video observation and\ninterviews do not show Youth A being choked by any staff. Staff 3,\nafter being kicked in the groin area, grabbed and bunched up\nYouth A’s sweatshirt and pushed the chair, yelling at Youth A.\nStaff 1 had to remove Staff 3’s hands from Youth A. Although Staff\n3 was kicked in the groin, he should have released Youth A,\ninstead of pushing and increasing his grip on him.\n4",
    "Conclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2024C0001164SI dated 04/15/2024, CAP Approved\n05/07/2024.\nSIR 2024SIC0001235 dated 05/15/2024, CAP Pending.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n10/1/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
