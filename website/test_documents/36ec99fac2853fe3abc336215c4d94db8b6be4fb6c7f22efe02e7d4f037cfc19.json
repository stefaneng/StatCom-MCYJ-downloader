    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nDuring the period under review there has not been any special investigations.\nDuring the onsite visit, a walkthrough of the facility occurred. The facility was clean,\nmedications were locked and stored appropriately, food and menus were viewed, and\nthe facility did not have any safety concerns that were noted during the walk through.\nThe facility continues to have a variance through November 1, 2022, for Rule\n400.527(1): Sprinkler system. The facilities entrance is still under construction due to\nthe work on the dry system. The dry system was tested on 9/12/2022 and the facility\nreceived a test certificate for the hydrostatic two-hour test at 200 psi on the dry\nsystem following NFPA guidelines on the dry system. The dry system is currently\nturned off and drained of all water and air while Superiorland Electronics waits for dry\npendant heads to be installed. Once the dry pendant heads are installed the dry\nsystem can be placed back into service and the fire suppression inspection can then\nbe completed. The contractor is starting to do insulation work and once that is\ncomplete then drywall work will start. Fifteen-minute walk through checks of the\nfacility were viewed while on site.\nInterviews with staff and youth occurred. Staff are feeling safe at the facility and feel\na sense of connection with one another which has created a family feel work\nenvironment. Youth reported feeling safe at the facility and well cared for. Youth\nreported receiving schooling at the facility and being able to participate in credit\nrecovery. Youth reported receiving therapy and having good connection with staff.\n2",
