INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 10/07/23, youth was physically put in a room by staff member.\nStaff pushed youth on the floor to her knees and she hit her chin\non the cement from the bedframe. Youth has a nickel size bruise\non her arm and her back hurts. Youth has been at the facility since\n09/26/23. Staff were having issues with her behavior, so they were\ntrying to put her in a secluded room.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Administrator was interviewed face to face at\nthe facility on 10/10/23 alone and on 10/17/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Administrator reported he became aware\nof the allegations because Youth A met with Clinician and\nreported concerns. Administrator asked Clinician to have Youth A\nwrite a statement about the incident, which she did. Administrator\ncalled Supervisor 1 and told him he was being reassigned to a\ndifferent building until the investigation was complete. Consultant\nreviewed the video footage with Administrator. Administrator was\nasked about Supervisor 1 pushing Youth A and about Staff 1 and\nSupervisor pulling Youth A to the room by her arms. Administrator\nstated “It’s a culture here. What are staff to do when it’s a stand-\noff with a youth for 90 minutes? Staff feel we have lost all control.\nYouth know we can’t go hands on unless it’s life or death, so they\nsay, ‘fuck you’ and do whatever they want. Staff are burnt out.”\nWhen asked about Staff 1 and Supervisor 1 grabbing Youth A's\narms and yanking her down the hallway, Administrator identified\nthose actions as Staff 1 and Supervisor 1 completing a physical\nescort down the hallway. Administrator noted he did not feel\nSupervisor or Staff 1 did anything wrong during the incident.\nAdministrator stated, “The State has made it really punitive with\nthe new restraint rules, so staff feel they cannot do anything”.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/17/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported\non 10/7/23 she was talking to Staff 1 about what another youth did\n2",
    "to her the previous night, but it didn’t seem like he was listening.\nYouth A admitted she became angry and escalated. Youth A\nreported when she became escalated, Staff 1 called for\nassistance and Supervisor 1 came to help. Youth A reported\nSupervisor 1 must have thought she was going to hit Staff 1\nbecause he got in between the two of them, pushed her\nbackwards and said, “you’re too close to staff”. Youth A reported\nSupervisor 1 told her to get in a seclusion room, but she did not\nwant to go into a seclusion room, so she didn’t comply. Staff 1 and\nSupervisor 1 each grabbed one of her wrists/lower arms, yanked\nher in front of the room and shoved her into the room. Youth A\nreported she tried to resist going into the room because they\ngrabbed her, but she didn’t fight back.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/17/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 1\nreported Staff 1 called for assistance due to Youth A’s behaviors\n(i.e., threatening Staff 1 and throwing items down the hallway), so\nhe responded to help. Supervisor 1 reported when he arrived,\nYouth A was standing in front of the staff office and Staff 1\nprovided him with a summary of what occurred. Youth A then\napproached Staff 1 in an aggressive physical manner, so\nSupervisor 1 reported he stepped in between them and used his\nleft arm to swipe and create space in between them. Supervisor 1\nreported he also told Youth A to step back, back-up or stop, and\n“we’re not doing this”. Supervisor 1 reported he asked Youth A to\nsit down in the hallway and relax, but she refused. Supervisor 1\nreported he and Staff 1 helped Youth A to a seclusion room by\ncompleting a CPI two-man transport which included each of them\nputting one of their hands around Youth A’s wrists while their other\nhand was on her shoulders. Supervisor 1 was asked about\npushing Youth A when he stepped in between Youth A and Staff 1\nin the hallway. Supervisor 1 reported he was trying to create\nspace between Staff 1 and Youth A and there was no intent to\nforcefully push her, but it might have been harder than he thought.\nSupervisor 1 reported keeping personal space was the biggest\ngoal for him, which is why things quickly became more physical.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 10/17/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported on\n10/7/23, Youth A began talking to him about a situation that\noccurred the night before. Staff 1 explained to her he didn’t work\nthe night before, so he couldn’t speak about what happened or\nwhy. Staff 1 reported Youth A kept getting louder, so he tried to\nexplain to her again, but she wasn’t calming down. Staff 1\nreported Youth A threw a Pink Lotion bottle down the hallway.\n3",
    "Staff 1 reported normally he and Youth A have a decent rapport,\nso he asked her to sit and refocus, so they could continue the\nconversation when she was calmer. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nrefused to sit and called him a “fat motherfucker”. Staff 1 reported\nhe called for assistance and Supervisor 1 arrived. Supervisor 1\ntold Youth A to have a seat several times, but she didn’t listen.\nStaff 1 reported while he was debriefing with Supervisor 1, Youth\nA came towards him, so Supervisor 1 stepped in between them\nand said, “don’t touch my staff”. Staff 1 reported Supervisor 1 put\nhis arm out to stop her but did not push her. Staff 1 reported he\nand Supervisor 1 did a two-person CPI transport to get her into a\nseclusion room.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 10/17/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nwas attempting to talk to Staff 1 about an incident that occurred\nthe night before. Staff 2 reported while they were talking, Youth A\nwent from 0 to 100 quickly. Staff 2 reported Youth A was yelling\nand throwing grooming items down the hallway. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 called for Supervisor 1’s assistance. Staff 2 reported she\ndid not see or hear anything after Staff 1 called for assistance.\nClinician was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/17/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Clinician reported\nYouth A filled out a form on 10/9/23 requesting to meet with him.\nClinician reported during their meeting, she showed him a bruise\non her right top forearm which was approximately the size of a\nquarter. Youth A talked to him about the incident and reported the\ninformation in the allegations. Clinician reported Youth A stated\nshe felt safe going back to the unit. After the meeting with Youth\nA, Clinician spoke with Supervisor 2 about the incident. Supervisor\n2 sent the concerns via email to Administrator and Supervisor 1.\nAdministrator then filed a MDHHS complaint. Clinician spoke with\nYouth A to let her know a complaint was made and asked her to\nwrite a statement about the incident per the request of\nAdministrator.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via video\nconference on 10/19/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker.\nThe video footage was reviewed with CA. CA noted concerns\nYouth A was standing still in a corner when Supervisor 1 and Staff\n1 aggressively moved her down the hallway and to a seclusion\nroom, which was unnecessary. CA reported at the facility they\nwork towards very strategic interventions with youth and this\nphysical intervention happened quicker than normal.\n4",
    "VIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED:\nVideo footage for 10/7/23 was reviewed. It should be noted there\nwas no audio. Youth A is looking at a mirror hung on the window\nof the staff office. Supervisor 1 walks behind her, looks in a room\non the opposite side of the staff office and then walks back and\nstands behind Youth A. Staff 1 is seen on the lefthand side of\nYouth A and they are exchanging words. Youth A then walks\naway from the mirror and steps towards Staff 1. Youth A was\nstanding face to face with Staff 1 when Supervisor 1 stepped in\nbetween them. Youth A shoves her body against Supervisor 1 and\nSupervisor 1 takes his hand, puts it on her upper chest and\nshoves her backwards against the wall/glass windows of the staff\noffice. Supervisor 1 remains in between Staff 1 and Youth A.\nSupervisor 1 points down the hallway. Staff 1 walks to the room\ndirectly past the staff office and unlocks the door. Supervisor 1 is\nstanding side-by-side next to Youth A in front of the staff office.\nSupervisor 1 has his hand underneath Youth A’s arm, and they\ntake a couple steps towards the room Staff 1 unlocked. Youth A\nthen yanks her arm away from Supervisor 1’s grasp and steps\nbackwards. Supervisor 1 turns to face her, and they exchange\nwords. Staff 1 is seen taking the mattress out of the room and\nthrowing it on the hallway floor. Supervisor 1 is standing in front of\nYouth A while her back is up against the windows/wall of the staff\noffice. Staff 1 walks over, stands next to them and points down to\nthe open room past the staff office. Staff 1 walks away and stands\nin front of the open room while Supervisor 1 stands facing Youth\nA. Supervisor 1 points towards the room Staff 1 is standing by\ntwice. Supervisor 1 looks at Staff 1 and exchanges words. Then\nStaff 1 comes towards them. Youth A is in the corner outside of\nthe staff office. Staff 1 grabs one of Youth A’s forearms while\nSupervisor 1 grabs her other forearm and they both pull her out of\nthe corner by her arms. They position themselves on either side of\nher and push her into the open room with one of their hands\npositioned around her forearm and the other on her shoulder.\nYouth A is seen resisting while they push her towards the room.\nOnce she is in the room, they are out of camera view. Staff 1 and\nSupervisor 1 are in the room with Youth A for approximately 24\nseconds before they both exit the room (Staff 1 first, followed by\nSupervisor 1) and shut the door. Staff 1 is seen with Youth A’s\nglasses in his hand, and he puts them in the staff office.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Facility incident report dated 10/7/23 authored by Staff 1.\nThe incident report states Youth A started to become\n5",
    "disrespectful by cussing and yelling at Staff 1. Youth A was\nthen instructed to have a seat to refocus, but Youth A said,\n“fuck you fat motherfucker” and threw grooming products\ndown the hall where Youth B was sitting. Supervisor 1 was\ncalled. When Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 were talking, Youth\nA made verbal threats, walked up to Staff 1, and made\nphysical contact with Staff 1. Youth A was placed in a non-\nviolent two-person transport escorted to room. Youth A was\nheld by the wrist and shoulder area. Incident report notes\nYouth A was seen by Nurse 1 on 10/7/23 and was given\nTylenol as Youth A reported her “back hurt a little”.\n• MiSACWIS Incident Report #164690210 dated 10/7/23\nauthored by Supervisor 1. As Staff 1 was explaining the\nsituation to Supervisor 1, Youth A became even more\nangry. Youth A began aggressively approaching Staff 1\nwhile yelling and cussing at him. Supervisor 1 attempted to\nstep between the resident and staff. Clear and concise\ndirections were given to Youth A to stop and take her\nposition in the back hall. Youth A continued making\nphysical contact with Supervisor 1. Youth A continued to\nescalate and make verbal threats. Due to the unsafe\nbehavior of Youth A, her inability to comply with simple\ninstruction, and in the effort to keep a safe working\nenvironment for staff, Youth A was directed to enter a\nseclusion room. Youth A refused several times. Supervisor\n1 and Staff 1 utilized CPI team transport to escort Youth A\ninto a seclusion room.\n• Oakland County Children’s Village Prohibited Practices\nPolicy (rev. 10/1/22) states pulling or pushing a youth on\nany part of their body for the purpose of punishment is\nprohibited.\n• Youth A’s written statement was reviewed, and it was\nmostly consistent with Youth A’s interview. However, in the\nwritten statement, Youth A reported Supervisor 1 pushed\nher inside the room and onto her knees, which caused her\nchin to hit the bed.\n• Staff 1 has one disciplinary record in his employee file\nunrelated to this investigation. Staff 1 has completed CPI\ntraining on at least annually since 2002, with the most\nrecent time being on 10/5/23.\n6",
    "• Supervisor 1 has no disciplinary records in his employee\nfile. Supervisor 1 has completed CPI training at least\nannually since 2014, with the most recent time being\n9/15/22.\n• CPI Sample Workbook states individuals are obligated to\nreduce use and prevent the misuse and abuse of physical\ninterventions. CPI Manual outlining approved safety\ninterventions does not show any physical management\ntechnique that would involve pushing a youth or pulling a\nyouth’s arms to escort them to another area.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and video footage reviewed, this\nviolation is established. The video footage shows Supervisor 1\npushed Youth A backwards. The video footage also shows Staff 1\nand Supervisor 1 grabbing Youth A’s wrists/lower arms and pulling\nher to the seclusion room, prior to implementing the approved CPI\ntwo-person transport.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2022C0217061 dated 10/19/22; CAP approved 11/17/22\nSIR 2023C00000020 dated 12/27/22; CAP approved 1/17/23\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Supervisor 1 grabbed youth's arms, put them behind her back and\nlifted them to her neck.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/17/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker.

Supervisor 1 grabbed both of her arms behind her back and\nyanked them upwards (like chicken wings) and held them in place\nagainst her back. Youth A reported she wasn’t fighting against\nthem or resisting, so there was no reason to restrain her arms or\nhold her against the bed.
