    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4124 Communication\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a written policy regarding\nDescription communication that ensures that a child is able to communicate\nwith family and friends in a manner appropriate to the child’s\nfunctioning and consistent with the child’s treatment plan and\nsecurity level.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was forced to talk about something in therapy they did not\nwant to. Youth later placed a bag over their head and went back to\ntheir room. The youth was found with a bag over their head. Youth\nis not allowed visitors and will have to restart the program.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Youth A’s Mother (Mother) was interviewed via\nphone on 11/30/23. Mother reported after the incident occurred\nwith the bag, Youth A was not allowed visitors, which is against\nthe court order for visitation. Mother reported Youth A doesn’t\nwant to be at the facility and is upset she must start the program\nover. Mother reported Youth A is forced to talk in therapy and\nwants to “pummel [Therapist 1] to a pulp”.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n12/4/23. Therapist 1 reported in a therapy session on 11/2/23,\nYouth A disclosed she sexually abused her brother. Therapist 1\ntold Youth A she had to report it to MDHHS, which caused Youth\nA to become upset. As a result, Therapist 1 put her on 10-minute\nsafety checks for the night, but no incidents occurred. The\nfollowing morning (Friday 11/3/23), staff completed a suicide\nscreening with Youth A before school, and there was no risk\ndetermined. Youth A went to school and there were no issues at\nschool. Youth A came back to the facility after school and was fine\nfor about an hour. However, at around 4-4:30 pm, staff completed\na safety check on Youth A in her room and she had a bag over\nher head with a string tied around her neck. Therapist 1 reported\nstaff took Youth A to Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital for\nevaluation, and she was approved for inpatient hospitalization.\nTherapist 1 reported Youth A did not go into inpatient\nhospitalization until the following day (Saturday 11/4/23).\nTherapist reported Mother was notified of the incident by Therapist\n2 on 11/3/23 at 9:45 pm. Therapist 1 reported youth never go\n“backwards” in their program, and Youth A does not have to\nrestart the program. Therapist 1 reported she isn’t sure where\nanyone got the impression Youth A would have to start over.\nTherapist 1 reported she isn’t sure why anyone would state Youth\n2",
    "A wasn’t allowed visits, because it is not accurate. Therapist 1\nreported Youth A was in inpatient hospitalization at the time of the\nnormal visit, so the visit was cancelled. Therapist 1 reported\nMother and Stepfather went to the hospital to visit Youth A\nunauthorized and unsupervised, which is not allowed per court\norder. Therapist 1 reported afterwards, Youth A stated Mother and\nStepfather are “shady” and never follow the rules, so she no\nlonger wanted to see Mother. Therapist 1 reported Youth A has\nnot seen Mother face to face since then, per her own choice,\nwhich is Youth A’s decision according to the court order.\nYouth A’s Foster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via\nphone on 12/5/23. FCW reported the day after the therapy\nsession, Youth A called FCW to ask if she would still be able to\nvisit with her brothers after what she disclosed in therapy, and\nFCW told Youth A she didn’t know yet, so they would have to talk\nabout it at another time. Later that night, FCW received\ninformation from the facility Youth A was found with a bag over her\nhead and a string around her neck during one of their room\nchecks. Staff informed FCW they ripped the bag from Youth A’s\nhead to allow her to breathe. FCW met with Youth A on 11/30/23,\nafter these allegations came in, and Youth A told her she was not\nforced to talk about anything in therapy. Youth A told FCW she\nvoluntarily discussed her history in a therapy session with\nTherapist 1 and was not prompted. FCW reported she was never\ntold anything about Youth A being required to restart the program\nbecause of this incident. FCW reported after the incident, Youth A\nwas hospitalized for a few days. FCW reported Youth A normally\nhas a parenting visit with Mother on Monday, but Youth A was still\nin the hospital stabilizing, so the visit was cancelled. FCW\nreported Mother and Stepfather showed up at the hospital and\nhad an unauthorized and unsupervised visit with Youth A. FCW\nreported Mother is not allowed to have unsupervised visits and\nStepfather isn’t allowed visits at all, so this shouldn’t have\nhappened. FCW reported Youth A was upset during the visit\nbecause Mother and Stepfather were trying to convince her to\nleave the hospital and showed up without permission. Afterwards,\nYouth A reported she didn’t want to see Mother anymore. FCW\nreported Youth A has not seen Mother for a month, which is per\nher own choice, and is allowed by the court order.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n12/18/23. Youth A reported she has never been forced to talk\nabout anything in therapy, and Therapist 1 does the opposite by\nexplaining she doesn’t have to talk about anything she doesn’t\nwant to. Youth A reported she told Mother she couldn’t have\n3",
    "visitors as an excuse because she wanted Mother to leave her\nalone. Youth A reported she is allowed to make the choice not to\nsee Mother per the court order and hasn’t wanted to see her.\nYouth A reported Mother told her she would have to restart the\nprogram, which upset her. However, Youth A assumed Mother\nmight be lying, so she asked Therapist 1 the following day and\nTherapist 1 confirmed she would not have to restart the program.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Berrien County Court Order dated 6/27/23 states [Youth A]\nmay have parenting visits at her discretion.\n• None of the emails or incident notifications reviewed noted\nanything about restricting Youth A’s visitations or her being\nrequired to restart the program.\n• Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services Plan for\nResident Care Policy (rev. 06/2023) outlines the Maple\nLodge program, performance improvement, process for\nassessment of youth, program focus, admission steps and\nongoing treatment steps. No where in the document does it\nstate youth will have to restart the program for any\ncircumstances. The document also outlines parent\nvisitation. It notes all visits and passes may occur arranged\nby the treatment team under the following conditions: it’s in\nthe best interest of the resident, the resident has\ndemonstrated safe behavior, the visit is not prohibited by\nthe referring agency or court order.\n• Therapist 1 has one disciplinary record in her employee file,\nunrelated to this investigation. Therapist 1 completed policy\ntraining on 11/4/22.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. Youth A reported she has never been\nforced to talk about anything in therapy. There is also no evidence\nto support Youth A was told she could not have visits. Youth A\nreported she told Mother she couldn’t have visits as an excuse,\nbecause she didn’t want to see her. In addition, it was established\nYouth A would not have a visitation with Mother while she was in\ninpatient hospitalization. However, the decision is in line with the\nfacility’s policy surrounding parental visitation as Youth A was not\ndemonstrating safe behavior and it wasn’t assessed to be in the\nbest interest of Youth A. Since her hospitalization, Youth A has\nchosen not to have parent visits with Mother, which is her decision\naccording to the court order regarding parental visitation. Youth A\n4",
    "reported Mother is the one who told her she would have to restart\nthe program, but Therapist 1 confirmed with Youth A (at the time)\nand Consultant (during this investigation) they don’t restart\nprogramming for any youth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth’s toe was swollen, and she did not receive medical care for\na month. Youth also had a near-drowning experience and was not\ntaken for medical care until a week and a half after the incident,\neven though she was experiencing trouble breathing. Youth is on\ntoo many medications and parental consent was not obtained for\nmedications.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Youth A’s Mother (Mother) was interviewed via\nphone on 11/30/23. Mother reported Youth A’s foot was stepped\non by a worker at the facility and her toe was swollen for a month.\nMother reported she and Youth A requested medical care for a\nmonth before Youth A was seen by a doctor. Mother reported\nwhen the facility finally took her to the doctor, the doctor said there\nwas nothing he could do. Mother reported this summer, Youth A\nhad a near-drowning experience at a pool, and she wasn’t taken\nto a doctor until a week and a half later. Mother reported Youth A\nhas asthma and Youth A reported her head was fuzzy and she\nwas having trouble breathing for the week leading up to seeing the\ndoctor. Mother reported the only reason Youth A was seen by the\ndoctor was because Mother begged for it to happen. Mother\nreported Youth A is on too many medications and she never\nprovided consent for Youth A to be on any medications. Mother\ndoes not feel the medications are warranted and Youth A doesn’t\nfeel she needs all the medications. Mother reported due to all of\nthis, Youth A doesn’t feel safe at the facility. Mother reported she\nis supposed to receive all medical information about Youth A but\nhasn’t received any in a while.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n12/4/23. Therapist 1 reported Youth A has not had any breathing\nissues related to water activities. Therapist 1 reported Youth A has\ngone to the YMCA 2-3 times per week since March 2023 and\nswims almost every time. Therapist 1 reported Youth A went on a\n5",
    "trip to Michigan Adventures over the summer and there were no\nreported incidents or concerns after the trip. However, during the\nnext parenting visit, Youth A told Mother she almost drowned in\nthe wave pool and had to be pulled out by staff. Therapist 1\nreported she didn’t hear about this concern after the parenting\ntime. More than 24 hours after the visit, Mother emailed Therapist\n1 and said, “she almost drowned and needs to be taken to urgent\ncare ASAP”. Therapist 1 reported the email was sent on a\nweekend and she doesn’t work weekends, so she didn’t receive it\nuntil the following Monday. Therapist 1 reported the nursing\ndepartment completed an assessment on Youth A the same day\nshe received the email from Mother, and there were no concerns\nwith her breathing. Therapist 1 reported she sent an email to\nMother notifying her Youth A was examined and there were no\nconcerns. Therapist 1 reported she has no idea what happened to\nYouth A’s toe or when it happened because Youth A never said\nanything to staff about it hurting or bothering her. Therapist 1\nreported Youth A told Mother during a parenting time her toe was\nswollen. Therapist 1 reported FCW told her about the concern\nafter the parenting time and Therapist 1 agreed to have the\nnursing department examine Youth A. Therapist 1 reported the\nnursing department examined Youth A and the doctor instructed\nYouth A to wrap her toe, ice it, and take Tylenol as needed for\npain, so they followed those instructions. Therapist 1 reported\nwhen it didn’t get better, they took Youth A to urgent care and an\nx-ray was completed. Therapist 1 reported the x-ray showed the\ntoe was not broken or fractured, so the recommendations for\ntreatment remained the same. Therapist 1 reported Youth A\nwasn’t walking differently, and her toe injury didn’t seem to be\naffecting her daily functioning. Therapist 1 reported Youth A tends\nto be delayed in reporting issues and concerns, so they seem to\nbe coming up randomly, and after the fact, during conversations\nwith staff members or Mother. Therapist 1 reported Mother hasn’t\nconsented to medications because there is a court order stating\nMDHHS can consent to mental health treatment, including\nmedications. Therapist 1 reported Mother has a history of refusing\nto sign for necessary services and medications for Youth A, which\nis why the court order exists.\nYouth A’s Foster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via\nphone on 12/5/23. FCW reported there is a court order allowing\nMDHHS to sign for medications because Mother has repeatedly\nrefused to sign paperwork for services and medication. FCW\nreported she supervises parenting times between Youth A and\nMother. During one of the visits (unsure of which date), Youth A\ntold her mother her foot hurt. FCW reported during the visit, Youth\n6",
    "A had 4-inch heels on and was running in them during the visit.\nWhen Youth A took the heels off, she complained her toe hurt and\nit was swollen at the time. FCW reported Youth A then told Mother\na staff member (didn’t say who) stepped on her foot and she\nthought her toe was broken. Mother said she thought it was\nbroken too because it was swollen. FCW reported she reached\nout to Therapist 1 within the next day or two and asked the facility\nto have Youth A’s toe examined. FCW reported when Youth A\nsaw the nurse, it was determined it was not broken and they\nwrapped it. FCW reported Youth A also had an x-ray, which\ndetermined it wasn’t broken. FCW reported Youth A never\ndisclosed when a staff member stepped on her foot, so it is\nunknown the length of time between when it happened and when\nYouth A reported it during the parenting time. FCW reported Youth\nA was examined timely, and it did not take a month. FCW reported\nduring another parenting visit, Youth A told Mother during the\nMichigan Adventure trip over the summer, she “almost drowned”.\nFCW reported Youth A stated she fell in the wave pool and water\ncovered her face. FCW reported Youth A went to Michigan\nAdventure on a Saturday and it was the following Thursday when\nYouth A complained. Mother stated she needed to be medically\nexamined to determine if there was fluid in her lungs because she\nhas breathing difficulties. The day after the parenting time, FCW\ncalled Therapist 1 and requested an exam. FCW reported the\nfacility completed the exam timely and there were no findings.\nFCW reported she informed Mother of the findings from both\nsituations.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 12/8/23. Staff 1 reported\nhe was not around Youth A during most of the Michigan\nAdventure trip this past summer. Staff 1 reported he was never\ntold by Youth A or any other staff members Youth A had any\nincidents during the water park trip.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 12/5/23. Staff 2 reported\nshe was with Youth A the entire time she was at Michigan\nAdventures, which included the water park. Staff 2 reported Youth\nA had no incidents in the water park, never went under water in\nthe wave pool, never came up gasping for air and did not\ncomplain of any trouble breathing or her head being fuzzy after\nthe trip. Staff 2 reported Youth A did complain of a small migraine\nafter doing some laps in the wave pool, but nothing else. Staff 2\nreported while they were in the water park, there was a child who\nhad to be pulled out of the wave pool due to a near-drowning\nincident while they were present, but that child had no association\nto the facility.\n7",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed via phone on 12/14/23. Staff 3 reported\nshe went to Michigan Adventures with Youth A on 7/13/23. Staff 3\nreported she was around Youth A the entire time Youth A was in\nthe wave pool. Staff 3 reported Youth A was in the wave pool for a\nwhile and then came over to Staff 3 and stated, “I almost\ndrowned”. Staff 3 reported she was watching Youth A the entire\ntime and she never showed any signs of almost drowning (i.e.\nsputtering water, coughing, flailing her arms, panicking, etc.). Staff\n3 reported at one point she was holding Youth A’s hand in the\nwave pool, but she never pulled Youth A out of the water.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n12/18/23. Youth A reported her toe was swollen and hurt for 2\nmonths, but she told staff members at the facility and someone\nfrom nursing addressed it. Youth A reported she received an x-ray\nand there was nothing wrong. Youth A couldn’t remember if she\ntook medicine or what the actual issue with her toe was. Youth A\nreported everyone at the facility made sure her toe was taken care\nof appropriately and no one neglected her or left it unaddressed.\nYouth A reported she doesn’t remember telling Mother about her\ntoe until after all the care and the x-ray was done, so she would be\nable to tell Mother everything was fine. Youth A reported this past\nsummer she was on a trip to Michigan Adventures and was in the\nwave pool. She reported she didn’t know how wave pools worked,\nso she went into the deepest end of the pool. She reported when\nthe waves started coming, she didn’t know how to react. Youth A\nstated water splashed in her face and caused her to go under\nwater. Youth A reported she was underwater, then came up for a\nbreath and this repeated multiple times for about a minute until a\nstaff member (she couldn’t remember who), pulled her out of the\nwater. Youth A reported she went back in the wave pool multiple\ntimes afterwards because it was fun, and she wasn’t scared.\nYouth A reported when she arrived back at the facility, a staff\nmember (she couldn’t remember who) asked her if she felt any\nsloshing in her lungs, if her stomach hurt or if her throat hurt.\nYouth A reported she told staff members she was completely fine\nbesides a small headache and a sunburn, so she didn’t need to\nsee a doctor. Youth A reported she feels safe at the facility.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Berrien County Court Order dated 3/24/23 gives MDHHS to\nauthorize, request and consent to all recommended mental\nhealth treatment, including psychotropic medications for\n[Youth A].\n8",

Youth A reported she told staff\nmembers at the facility about her toe injury, and they addressed it\nquickly and appropriately. According to Therapist 1 and FCW,\nYouth A did not report her toe injury to anyone until she told\nMother at a visitation. FCW notified Therapist 1 late in the\nafternoon on Friday 9/29/23 and Youth A was assessed as well as\ntreated for the injury multiple times between 10/3/23-10/26/23.\nAny delay in treatment appears to be a result of Youth A not\nreporting her injury timely.\nAccording to Therapist 1, FCW, Staff 2 and Staff 3, Youth A did\nnot report an alleged near-drowning incident to anyone until she\ntold Mother at a visitation. Mother notified Therapist 1 on Saturday\n7/15/23, and Youth A was assessed by medical staff on Monday\n7/17/23.
