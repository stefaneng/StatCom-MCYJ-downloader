INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\nSection (3) The ratio formula for direct care workers shall correspond\nDescription with the institution’s purpose and the needs of the\nresidents and shall assure the continual safety, protection,\nand direct care and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The ratio of staff is not meeting the needs of the youth at facility as\nthere are multiple youth with suicidal, homicidal, and self-harming\nthoughts. Youth was being transported by one staff and sitting in\nthe front seat of a vehicle where they were able to put the vehicle\ninto gear and grab the keys. Youth was chased through a cornfield\nand brought to the hospital for injuries sustained.\nInvestigation The complainant in this investigation was anonymous and was not\nable to be contacted for any additional information.\nYouth A and Youth B were interviewed in person during an\nunannounced face-to-face visit on 11/23/2022. A full interview is\n3",
    "not conducted at the time in order to coordinate with DHHS\nWorker 1. This writer made contact with the Administrator to\ngather documents and staff and youth to be interviewed.\nIncident 1\nYouth A was interviewed on 11/28/2022 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated\nthat she recalled the incident in question where she was being\ntransported by a staff member and was able to grab the keys and\nrun away. She stated that Staff 1 was the staff member with her,\nand that there were no other staff involved. Youth A recalled that\nthey were being transported to a court meeting and on the way\nback they stopped at a gas station approximately a few miles from\nthe facility. Youth A stated that she grabbed the keys from the van\nwhile Staff 1 was in the driver seat, and immediately jumped out of\nthe car and ran away. Eventually Youth A made it a few blocks\ndown the road and jumped off a very short bridge to the ground\nbelow and hurt her ankle. By that time Youth A recalled there were\nadditional staff who had arrives to help her. Youth A stated that\nshe eventually voluntarily got in a car to go back to the facility and\nwas seen by the nurse for her ankle. Youth A stated that all of this\nwas caused by Staff 1 asking her if she was doing OK after the\ncourt meeting and Youth A being triggered. Youth A stated that\nshe did not believe Staff 1 was being negligent in any form. She\nalso stated that she has been transported by one staff many times\nin the past without issue and was not aware of any facility rules\nagainst this.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 12/05/2022\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. She\nconfirmed that she was the staff member who had given Youth A\na ride to her court meeting as alleged. Staff 1 stated that she\nrequested that Youth A sit in the front seat out of concern for\nsafety. Staff 1 stated a similar course of events as Youth A that\nresulted in Youth A taking the car keys and running away to\neventually be found and taken back to the facility. Staff 1 stated\nthat she has driven other youth alone in the past, and that there\nare no policies at the facility that prohibit this. She also stated that\nthere are times in her work with Youth A that Youth A had safe\nbehaviors and a baseline that would allow for this type of\ntransportation.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker\n1 on 12/21/2022. While Supervisor 1 was no longer employed by\nthe facility at the time of this interview, she did say that she felt\n4",
    "that there were many times when staff were stretched too thin and\nstruggled to maintain supervision and safety of the youth placed at\nthe facility. When asked to clarify, Supervisor 1 stated that what\nshe really meant was that ratios were always met and supervision\nrequirements such as one-on-one plans, but it generally meant\nthat staff were mandated to continue shifts or were working\novertime or were coming from other locations on the campus in\norder to help out with staffing. Supervisor 1 stated that she was\nthe supervisor at the time of the incident in question involving\nYouth A and Staff 1. She stated that she would have preferred two\nstaff be involved in the transportation, but that was not a\ndocumented requirement.\nIncident 2\nYouth B was interviewed on 11/28/2022 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. He\nconfirmed that she had an incident where she had to go to the\nhospital after escalating and self-harming as was described in the\nallegations. She stated that she ran out of the facility and into a\nfield during this incident and recalled that staff were following her.\nYouth B stated that she couldn’t remember exactly what staff this\nwas. Youth B also described several other recent incidents that\ninvolved self-harm, fights with other youth, restraints, or\nhospitalization trips. She stated that there were not any times that\nshe could recall during any of these incidents where there was not\nsufficient staff in the facility with her or outside of the facility.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 12/21/2022\nduring an announced face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nconfirmed that she was a part of the incident in question where\nYouth B ran from the facility and received minor injuries as a\nresult. Staff 2 also confirmed that she was a part of a separate\nincident involving Youth B where she attempted to tie a sweatshirt\naround her neck to self-harm. Staff 2 stated that incident ended\nwith Youth B sitting on the floor and giving up the sweatshirt and\nStaff 2 was able to de-escalate and talk with her. Staff 2 stated\nother staff were involved in the incident. A review of the incident\nreport indicates that there is not concern that a lack of staff\navailable to meet ratios lead to Youth B’s self-harming attempt.\nIncident 3\nDuring separate interviews in this investigation allegations were\nbrought up that there was an incident involving Youth D self-\nharming during his previous time placed at the facility. This\n5",
    "occurred on 11/17/2022 overnight. Youth D was able to take a\nscrap piece of a T-shirt and wrap it around his neck to only have\nstaff remove it quickly. Staff 3 was a direct care worker involved in\nthis incident. She was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on\n1/20/2023 over the phone. Staff 3 stated that Youth D had a safety\nplan set up the night of the incident where he had two staff\ninvolved in having eyes on supervision over the course of the\nnight. Staff 3 stated that there were more than two staff involved\nwith Youth D that night because he was escalated for a long\nperiod of time. She recalled that he had his safety blanket over\nhim as he was laying in bed, talking with staff when they noticed\nthat he stopped talking for a few seconds, and appeared to be\nstruggling to breathe. Staff 3 stated that she got her fingers\nunderneath the fabric on his neck and removed it from his hands\nwithin seconds. Staff 3 then re-confirmed that there never was a\nlack of supervision as required during the incident. She stated\nthat she later became aware that Youth D allegedly got his hands\non the scrap of fabric during his shower time earlier in the night\nbefore her shift.\nStaff 4 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n01/20/2023. She confirmed that she was a staff member involved\nin the incident where Youth D self-harmed overnight during two to\none supervision. She gave a very similar course of events and her\nrecollection of what had occurred. Staff 4 stated that she pulled\nthe blanket off of Youth D when Staff 3 quickly figured out that the\nyouth may have been harming himself. Staff 4 stated that Youth D\nhad something tied around his neck and it was removed almost\nimmediately. Staff 4 stated that she did not know how Youth D\nwas able to procure this item to attempt at self-harm but was\nconfident that he did not do so under her watch while she was\nsupervising him. She stated that she had heard from Youth D that\nhe had gotten the scrap of fabric during a shower earlier in the day\nand stuck it under his undergarments to hide it. Staff 4 stated that\nshe has acted as a one-on-one supervisor for several other youth\nin her time working at the facility and has never had any concerns\nabout being out of ratio or not able to provide that enhanced\nsupervision.\nAdministrator was interviewed in person during an announced\nvisit to the facility with DHHS Worker 1 on 01/25/2023. He stated\nthat he had been involved in the incident of self-harm overnight\nwith Youth D because he had asked staff to contact him if any\nsuch incident were to occur around that time. Administrator stated\nthat Youth D had admitted to unraveling the hem of a T-shirt\nduring shower time the evening prior to the incident because he\n6",
    "was able to do so while in a shower stall changing for a shower.\nAdministrator provided a consistent version of events that\noccurred when staff stopped Youth D from self-harming in the very\nearly morning hours the next day.\nStaff 5 was interviewed in person during an announced face-to-\nface visit at the facility on 02/01/2023. She stated that she\nremembered the Youth D incident and worked with him that day.\nStaff 5 stated that there was not a concern over lack of\nsupervision of Youth D the evening prior or during the actual\nincident of self-harm.\nStaff 6 was interviewed on 02/01/2023 With DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit at the facility. She stated\nthat couldn’t remember is she was involved with Youth D, taking a\nshower the night prior to his attempted self-harm, despite being\nnamed by other staff as working with Youth D that day. Staff 6 did\ndescribe the shower requirements that she makes sure staff\nenforce when there is a one-to-one or two-to-one supervision\nsituation.\nStaff 7 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n02/07/2023. She confirmed that she was involved with Youth D\nduring one-on-one as well as two-to-one supervision\nrequirements. Staff 7 stated that Youth D’s enhanced supervision\nhas always been able to be accomplished when she has been\ninvolved and she believed that even with this involvement it is\npossible for someone like Youth D to procure a small item and\nhide it on their person during showering time because there are no\nrules in place from the past facility to witness youth nude before,\nduring, or after their showers.\nIncident 4\nYouth C was interviewed on 01/18/2023 during an announced\nface-to-face visit at the facility. Allegations from other youth were\nshared with her in regard to instances where she did not have\none-on-one supervision as she needed. Youth C stated that she\ndoes not believe she has ever lacked one-on-one supervision\nwhen it was required. She did state that there may have been a\ntime where she shared one-on-one supervision with another\nyouth, meaning that both of the youth required this, and one staff\nfilled the role. When asked for any more details Youth C stated\nshe could not remember when this may have been or what staff\nmember may have been involved. Youth C was also interviewed\non 02/10/2023 to ask for any more details in regard to allegations\n7",
    "made by other youth that she has lacked one-on-one supervision.\nYouth C described a situation where she had attempted to self-\nharm with a fork as well as a situation where she ran out of her\nunit at night. Youth C stated that both instances involved staff\nmembers covering the one-on-one supervision and she noted that\nshe was not able to hurt herself in either situation because they\nintervened.\nIncident 5\nDuring the course of the investigation new allegations were\nbrought up that Youth A was able to procure a razor blade\nsometime during the month of December 2022 and use it to self-\nharm during a time that she had one-on-one supervision. The day\nthat this allegedly occurred was 12/22/2022. Both Staff 11 and\nYouth A were interviewed separately and presented consistent\naccounts of how Youth A was able to have a razor in her\npossession on that date through Christmas gift bags received by\nthe facility for the youth. Both individuals stated that Staff 11 was\nable to take the razor away from Youth A without incident before\nany self-harm occurred.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Staff schedules for the facility for the months of August\nthrough December 2022. Scheduling indicated a proper\ncoverage of ratio needed to supervise the youth placed at\nthe facility.\n• Safety Plan dated 11/16/2022 - Written by the facility\nTherapist and states that “Staff will stay within 6 feet of\nYouth A during waking hours and post by her bed during\nsleep hours.” Safety plan is signed by the Therapist and\nYouth A on 11/16/2022 and staff began to sign off receipt of\nthe plan from 11/21/2022 to 11/28/2022.\n• Incident Report dated 11/18/2022 - Provided consistent\naccount of Youth A attempting self-harm with a slap band\nbracelet during the early morning hours of 11/18/2022.\n• Incident Report dated 11/18/2022 - Provided consistent\naccount of Youth B attempting self-harm during the evening\nof 11/16/2022.\n• 1 on 1 Staffing Request & Approval Form for Youth C dated\n02/05/2023 and signed by the facility Therapist. This\ndocument indicates one-on-one supervision of Youth C\nbegan on 12/20/2022 but was not yet approved by Youth\nC’s case management. It also notes that the enhanced\nsupervision covers 16 hours per day and does not include\nnighttime hours.\n8",
    "• Safety Plan updated 12/08/2022 – Written by the facility\nTherapist and states that “Staff will stay within 6 feet of\nYouth A during waking hours and post by her bed during\nsleep hours.”\n• Documentation from Caro Community Hospital for a visit\nmade for Youth A on 12/22/2022. This visit was made to\nreceive medical attention for gastrointestinal discomfort on\nYouth A’s part. No self-harm injuries are noted that could\nhave resulted from having a razor.\n• Log sheet for the unit where Youth A resided on\n12/22/2022. This confirms that one-on-one staffing was\nsufficient for the youth on this date.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews with staff and youth as well as\ndocumentation review there was no evidence to support a finding\nthat staff ratios were insufficient to meet the needs of the youth\nplaced at the facility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents’ needs, implementation of treatment plans,\nand discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff member was texting while driving.\nInvestigation Staff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 12/05/2022\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. She was\ninterviewed regarding the incident of Youth A’s AWOL off campus\nunder her supervision. During this interview Staff 1 noted that she\nwas texting another staff member while driving Youth A just prior\nto the AWOL attempt. Staff 1 stated that she did this because she\nsensed escalating behavior from Youth A and she wanted to alert\nothers and get assistance without Youth A noticing, but also knew\nthat it was risky to text while transporting a youth.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• “Procedure for Transporting Youth” policy from the agency\nthat states “Do not use handheld cell phone while operating\nvehicle”\n• “Employee Handbook” policy from the agency that states\n\"Employees may not use a hand-held cell phone while\noperating a vehicle – whether the vehicle is in motion or\n9",
    "stopped at a traffic light. This includes, but is not limited to,\nanswering or making phone calls, engaging in phone\nconversations, and reading or responding to e-mails,\ninstant messages, and text messages.\"\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews with staff as well as\ndocumentation review there is evidence to support that Staff 1\ndrove in an unsafe manner while transporting a youth. Per the\nagency's Employee Handbook texting and driving a youth is not\nallowed.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2022C0137004; CAP approved 01/13/2022\n2022C0137012; CAP approved 04/13/2022\n2022C0137036, CAP approved 10/11/2022\n2023C0000063; CAP approved 02/21/2023\n2023C0137003; CAP approved 03/13/2023\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the\nDescription direct supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable\ninterval, eye-on checks of residents. The time between the\nvariable interval checks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff were sleeping during overnight third shift duties.\nInvestigation Youth A was interviewed on 11/28/2022 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. While\ndescribing circumstances surrounding staff supervision and any\nself-harm or AWOL attempts, Youth A stated that she has seen\nStaff 8 sleeping on several occasions while working as the third\nshift staff responsible for the youth overnight. Youth A noted that\nStaff 8 would often fall asleep while being the only staff working\nduring that shift. She also stated that she self-harmed one night\nwhen this occurred.\nStaff 8 was interviewed on 12/05/2022 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 8\nrecalled the incident that Youth A described where she had self-\nharmed over the course of the night. Staff 8 initially denied falling\nasleep, but then stated that there have been times working third\nshift where she would put her head down or close her eyes. Staff\n8 stated that she couldn’t say that she has never fallen asleep\nduring that overnight shift.\nStaff 9 was interviewed 12/05/2022 with DHHS Worker 1 during\nan announced face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated that she\ncommonly works third shift. When asked if she has ever fallen\n10",
    "asleep during that overnight shift Staff 9 stated that she believes\nthat she has before. Staff 9 stated that she has seen other staff\nasleep during that overnight shift as well, and stated Staff 8 as the\nonly name she could think of specifically.\nStaff 10 was interviewed on 12/21/2022 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated\nthat she generally works third shifts with the youth and is\nsometimes alone, and sometimes with another staff for whatever\nextra supervision might be needed. Staff 10 was asked about\nstaff sleeping during third shift and she recalled a specific incident\nwhere a youth was able to self-harm while she suspected that\nStaff 8 had fallen asleep as the assigned overnight staff that\nevening. Staff 10 stated that she had reported to the unit and she\nhad seen Youth A awake and while talking to her noticed fresh\nwounds on Youth A’s arms from self-harm. Staff 10 stated that\nshe immediately sought out medical attention for Youth A. She\nrecalled Staff 8 sitting at a table near the front door of the unit and\nStaff 8 looked very groggy and had no idea that Youth A had been\nawake or self-harming for any amount of time.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews with staff and youth there was\nevidence to support a finding that staff have fallen asleep while\nperforming third shift duties caring for the youth placed at the\nfacility.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & Public Act 116 722.120 (c) Investigation, inspection, and\nSection examination of conditions, books, records, and reports;\nDescription access by department, bureau of fire services, or local\nauthorities; records; report; forms; confidentiality; disclosure\nof information; availability of confidential records; child\ninformation cards to be provided to department; failure of\nlicensee to cooperate with investigation, inspection, or\nexamination.\n(c) Providing accurate and truthful information to the\ndepartment, and encouraging witnesses, such as staff and\nhousehold members, to provide accurate and truthful\ninformation to the department.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff member falsified documentation of overnight supervision.\nInvestigation Staff 8 was interviewed on 12/05/2022 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. While\ndiscussing the allegations that she had fallen asleep while\nperforming third shift duties, Staff 8 noted that she was aware of\nthe requirements that she “check on” the youth in the unit every\n11",
    "hour at the least. The third shift log for that evening is marked off\nin a fashion that suggests youth were viewed eyes on every 15\nminutes.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Unit Shift Log Entry dated 11/17/2022 for the evening of\n11/17-11/18/2022 - This third shift log shows 15 minute\nchecks on youth and is not consistent with Staff 8’s account\nof how frequently youth were checked during her interview\non 12/05/2022.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews with staff as well as\ndocumentation review there was evidence to support a finding that\nstaff falsified records while performing third shift duties caring for\nthe youth placed at the facility, and therefore violated Public Act\n116 722.120 (c).\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nStaff are to perform varying interval checks not to exceed 15\nminutes when youth are asleep or otherwise outside the direct\nsupervision of staff. The agency should ensure these are\noccurring in varying intervals and not on every 15 minutes.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nSection (1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-to-\nDescription resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Safety plans were not followed allowing a youth to self-harm.\nInvestigation Staff 10 was interviewed on 12/21/2022 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility. In regard to\nthe incident where she discovered that Youth A had self-harmed\nwhile Staff 8 was the third shift staff, Staff 10 stated that she was\nnot sure if Youth A was on a safety plan or not. She stated that\nthere had not been any enhanced supervision or other\ninterventions applied to Youth A’s care that night as would be\ncommon with a safety plan.\nStaff 8 was interviewed over the phone on 01/25/2023 with DHHS\nWorker 1. She confirmed that she was the third shift staff member\nworking the night of Youth A’s self-harm noted in the added\nallegations. She stated that she had not been made aware of an\nupdated safety plan signed the day prior designed to help Youth A\navoid self-harm. Staff 8 stated that she did not see a safety plan\nfor Youth A in the days after that, either, and that the instruction\nwas always to sign them after reading them to document the\n12",
    "information was provided to all who need it. Staff 8 also confirmed\nthat she had spent the evening of 11/17-11/18/2022 sitting at the\ntable near the front door of the unit and was not physically near\nYouth A’s bed.\nThe Therapist who authored Youth A’s safety plan from\n11/16/2022 was interviewed on 02/10/2022 during an\nunannounced face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated that it\nhas always been her practice to immediately place a new safety\nplan for a youth in the hands of the staff currently working with that\nyouth and/or to put a copy of that new plan in the binder in the\nunit, requiring that staff sign off on it as they begin new shifts.\nTherapist has stated that she printed the safety plan and put it on\nthe binder on the unit as well as handed it to working staff during\nthe evening of 11/16/2022.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Safety Plan – Staff for Youth A signed by Therapist on\n11/16/2022.
