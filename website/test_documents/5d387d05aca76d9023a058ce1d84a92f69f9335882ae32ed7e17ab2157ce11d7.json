Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not provide services to Youth A related to her\nspecial needs, by assisting the foster family in getting needed\nservices, inclusive of CMH and respite services.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nFoster Parent B\nOn 1/13/2023, I interviewed Foster Parent B/the Complainant by\ntelephone. Foster Parent B reported his second concern with this\nagency Genesee County (GC)-DHHS (Department of Health and\nHuman Services) is the lack of help he was getting from GC-\nDHHS related to getting services for Youth A’s special needs. He\nsaid Youth A’s special needs includes Mild Autism, Mood Disorder\nMild Cognitive Impairment, and possible Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.\nHe said he resides in Monroe, and he understood there would be\nsome coordination of services, but he should not have had to do\neverything. He had to do all the work with Community Mental\nHealth (CMH) and to get Youth A’s records, from the Lighthouse\nRehabilitation Center where Youth A received prior treatment.\n2",
    "Foster Parent B reported, nor did GC-DHHS help him get services\nrelated to Youth A’s Autism and special needs. GC-DHHS kept\ntelling him they didn’t’ know how to, but so many of the things he\ntried to set up required GC-DHHS involvement. He said the\nagency never explained/told him about a SED Waiver, whether he\ncould get this service, or if the SED Waiver and Wraparound\nservices were connected or the same. The agency also never got\nhim respite services that the worker told him he was eligible for.\nGC-DHHS said there were none in his area, so he was out of luck.\nHe said other County CMH families, and Community services\npersons saw he was struggling and assisted him. The CMH in\nMonroe got his respite and wraparound services in place. He said\nYouth A was receiving ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) therapy\nservices (services for children on the autism spectrum). Those\nservices ended in October 2022 and GC-DHHS did not act to get\nYouth A services reinstated via another provider. He reported it\nhas only been recently that GC-DHHS has tried to assist him. He\nsaid FCW 6 was assigned to Youth A’s case in December 2022;\nand in the last three weeks FCW 6 has been assisting him. He\nsaid, FCW 5 and FCW 5’s supervisor did not do their job on Youth\nA’s case. He said he had to do everything including medication\nchanges and reviews; trying to get prior services records for Youth\nA and school records, all of which were records that could help get\nneeded services for Youth A.\nAgency Staff Interviews\nAdministrator 2, Supervisor 3, Supervisor 4\nOn 2/2/2023 I had a special investigation onsite entrance\nconference with Administrator 2, Supervisor 3, and Supervisor 4,\nat which time I reviewed the allegations with them.\nSupervisor 3 reported the allegation to be false. She said they\nwere involved with CMH immediately, but it took some time to get\nservices in place due to there being a cross-county situation.\nYouth A also had gone inpatient for a while in 2021; and after\nYouth A came back Youth A was working with a therapy in the\nfoster home. Youth A was connected with ABA service (A type of\nservice- not a provider) related to her Autism needs. Foster\nParent B was on a wait list for two providers in his area.\nSupervisor 3 reported Foster Parent B3 wanted to work with one\nspecific provider, and this is why he was on a wait list. While\nFoster Parent B waited, Service Person C was still involved with\nYouth A and Foster Parent B in the foster home.\n3",
    "Supervisor 3 reported the agency did not address the SED Waiver\nbecause they were waiting on the ABA services. She said Youth A\nmay have been eligible for both services, but FCW 5 may not\nhave known that. She said Youth A was eligible for respite in\nFoster Parent B’s area, but none were available. That there were\nno providers in the foster parent’s area to facilitate the respite.\nShe reported with respect to school records for Youth A, Foster\nParent B worked at the school that Youth A was attending at the\ntime and could have accessed the school records. She said FCW\n5 could speak more to those records being requested.\nAdministrator 2 reported respite may be available in Youth A’s\narea now; and FCW 6 can assist Foster Parent B with exploring\nthose. She said given that Foster Parent B is getting a level III\nDOC for Youth A, Foster Parent B may be eligible for assisted\ncare, but that must be applied for. The agency will check on this\nand assist with that now.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)5\nOn 2/2/2023 I interviewed FCW 5 onsite. She was the FCW for\nYouth A until October 2022. She reported various information in\nthe complaint is not factual. She reported prior to Youth A\nreceiving ABA services, Youth A had in home mental health\nservices via Service Person C. She said, when Youth A was first\nplaced with Foster Parent B she reached out to CMH to get\nservices in place in Monroe. She said Foster Parent B\nstonewalled the CMH case manager. She said getting the referral\nand intake occurred quickly. Getting the evaluation via CMH to\ndetermine the level of services Youth A would require took some\ntime due Foster Parent B not making and maintaining contact with\nCMH to get everything set up. FCW 5 explained that then Youth\nA began having manic episodes and was hospitalized at Harbor\nOaks for a couple of months (MISACWIS showed this time as\n5/23/2021-7/9/2021). While Youth A was hospitalized Foster\nParent B was involved on the case and there were meetings with\nhim. Suggestions were made to him on how he could assist Youth\nA in home with her needs. Meetings included FCW 5, Foster\nParent B, the CMH supervisor, FCW 5, Supervisor 3 and Youth\nA’s adoption worker. During one meeting Foster Parent B made a\nformal complaint against the CMH case manager which lead to\nCMH pushing forward and getting in home-based therapy in place\nwith Service Person C. Service Person C went to the home three\ntimes a week and worked with Youth A on Youth A’s\nunderstanding her emotions, how to deal with them; her triggers,\nsocial issues and calming exercises.\n4",
    "FCW 5 reported there were only two ABA Early Autism providers\nin Foster Parent B’s area, and Foster Parent B wanted a specific\none, so any delay in services was related to the transfer. She said\nService Person C’s services ended in 2022 when ABA Early\nAutism services started, which was around April or May 2022. The\nABA services were also home-based and similar services\nprovided by Service Person C, but more intensive. FCW 5\ndenied Foster Parent B having to go out of his way to get any of\nthe services in place. She said Service Person C had\nrecommended the provider Foster Parent B chose to go with.\nFoster Parent B would just have been following up on that\nrecommendation. FCW 5 acknowledged Foster Parent B may\nhave also looked for programs; and may have asked his sister for\nadvice, because his sister has a child on the spectrum.\nFCW 5 denied there being a length of time that Youth A was\nwithout services prior to her going on medical leave of absence in\nOctober 2022. She said the service hours had reduced due to the\nsupervisor and worker at the ABA provider agency quitting.\nYouth A went from having 15 hours a week to just one session a\nweek, with the director providing those services. The director\nreported she was trying to get more staff. FCW 5 said Foster\nParent B asked her whether he should try to get on another\nservice provider’s list or wait until this current service provider hire\nmore staff. FCW 5 said, she knew the other ABA provider would\nbe the one Foster Parent B did not choose the first time around;\nso, she advised Foster Parent B that GC-DHHS would support\nwhatever decision Foster Parent B made. FCW 5 admitted to\nlearning the director at Youth A’s ABA service provider quit, just\nbefore she went on her medical leave of absence. She said\nbefore she left she spoke with FCW 7 about Youth A’s case\nissues. She did not know what if anything FCW 7 followed up on\nbecause she learned later that FCW 7 quit.\nI asked FCW 5 about Foster Parent B getting respite and a SED\nWaiver for services. FCW 5 said when Foster Parent B brought\nrespite up, she spoke with Service Person C about this. Service\nPerson C reported they did not have respite providers via CMH in\nFoster Parent B’s area. Service Person C suggested that Foster\nParent B check with his relatives about being able to provide\nrespite. FCW 5 did not believe Foster Parent B had relatives who\ncould provide the level of help that Youth A required. She said\nthere was not much discussion with Foster Parent B about an\nSED Waiver because, given his DOC level and the services\nFoster Parent B was already getting, it was not different than what\nwould occur with the SED Waiver. She said the SED Waiver\n5",
    "would afford Youth A the classification, and enable her to get\nspecializes services, but Youth A was already getting the\nspecializes service. Foster Parent B was also getting Parent\nsupport via CMH.\nI also asked FCW 5 whether Foster Parent B had to get\nmedication and medication changes for Youth A. FCW 5 denied\nFoster Parent B having to seek out Youth A’s medication or\nchanges to it. She said all of Youth A’s medications came with\nYouth A when she was placed with Foster Parent B. Youth A was\nset up with Dr. D. Dr. D monitored Youth A’s medication and\nconducted her medication reviews. FCW 5 reported there was a\nstruggle with getting Youth A’s medication levels right, but Foster\nParent B’s work with the doctor would have been by way of\nreporting how Youth A was adjusting to the medications. Foster\nParent B would have also been responsible for taking Youth A to\nher medication reviews and reporting her behaviors to the\nmedication so that adjustments and or changes could be made if\nwarranted. This would have been a normal part of his role as a\nfoster parent.\nLastly I asked FCW 5 whether Foster Parent B had requested any\ndocuments from her, inclusive of school record which may have\nbeen needed to secure services for Youth A. FCW 5 said, Foster\nParent B had mentioned something about a possible sexual\nallegation that a Casa Worker had mentioned to him. FCW 5\nwent back through Youth A’s record. She saw an old investigation\nthat mentioned something when Youth A was five or years old, but\nthe investigation could not conclude there was any truth a sexual\nact against Youth A. She shared that information with Foster\nParent B. As for any school records, FCW 5 reported there was a\ndelay in getting school records from the Lighthouse Residential\nplacement where Youth A had attended. She said that facility\nconverted to an Adult Foster Care. She said that was back in\n2020, and Youth A's new school needed to request those records\nfrom the old school. FCW 5 reported that when Youth A was at\nthe Redford School, Foster Parent B was a special education\nteacher there and would have had access to Youth A’s school\nrecord. She said Foster Parent B has Youth A placed in the\nAirport school district in Monroe County later; and when she left\nfor her medical leave there were no school records needed, or\nissues in that area. She said she was not aware of a fetal alcohol\ndiagnosis for Youth A. She said the main issue of the case when\nshe left was Youth A’s delayed adoption due to a special\nevaluation. She said Foster Parent B tends to make complaints\nwhen he is frustrated and not getting his way.\n6",
    "Foster Care Worker (FCW) 6\nI interviewed FCW 6 onsite on 2/2/2023. FCW 6 was assigned to\nYouth A’s case on 12/19/2022. She met with Foster Parent B for\nfoster home visit on that date. Foster Parent B mentioned all of his\nconcerns at that home visit. Foster Parent B reported all of Youth\nA’s services via ABA-Early Autism services terminated in October\n2022. Foster Parent B said Youth A was getting around 30 hours\nof services and those when down to four hour between August\nand October of 2022. Foster Parent said Youth A’s services then\nstopped completely. The latter was because that ABA service\nprovider/agency shut down because the workers, then the\nsupervisor and the director all quit. Foster Parent B told FCW 6\nhe was placed on “Illuminate’s” wait list, which is, another ABA\nservice provider. Foster Parent B reported, he had reached out to\nFCW 5 about this. FCW 6 said she was not sure what all had\noccurred before, because she was just learning all this from\nFoster Parent B on her first visit with him.\nFCW 6 reported Youth A’s services via Illuminated started in\nJanuary 2023. The service hours for now are limited (FCW 5 was\nnot sure of the number of hours) until the Illuminate service worker\ncompletes all her required training. Thereafter, Youth A will get full\nservices. FCW 6 denied there was anything she had to do to get\nthis new services in place, but she reached out to CMH to inquire\nwhether there anything more she could do to get Youth A full\nservices sooner.\nFCW 6 said no other services had fallen off for Youth A. She said\nFoster Parent B asked about Wraparound, SED Waivers and\nrespite. Foster Parent B said FCW 5 told him he had to get\nWraparound or Respite. She told Foster Parent B she did not\nknow how they all those programs or services connected or\ncompared; she would check matters out and get back with him.\nFCW 6 said, she contacted the CMH in Monroe and Youth A\nshowed in their system, Youth A CMH case manager reported that\nan SED Waiver and Wraparound were in the works for Youth A.\nFCW 6 reported based on the information she had learned; Youth\nA will be eligible for both ABA services and a SED Waiver.\nFoster Parent B will have to choose either Wrapround or respite,\neither would allow for someone to come into the home to help and\ngive him a break.\nFCW 6 said Foster Parent B did not mention any concerns related\nto Youth A’s medication, medication reviews or him needing\nschool records or other records for Youth A.\n7",
    "Supervisor 8\nI interviewed Supervisor 8 by telephone on 2/24/2023. She was\nthe supervisor to FCW 7, who had Youth A’s case for a short\nperiod of time. FCW 7 resigned 12/15/2022/ is no longer with the\ndepartment. Supervisor 8 did recall FCW 7 mentioning an issue\nrelated to Youth A’s case. Foster Parent B never reached out to\nSupervisor 8 about Youth A’s case.\nDocument Review\nMISACWIS case record for Youth A which showed:\n• Youth A is and permanent ward of the court and adoption is\npending with Foster Parent B\n• She was placed with Foster Parent B on 2/3/2021.\n• She had a mental health hospital stay on 5/23/2021 and\nwas returned to Foster Parent B’s care on 7/9/2021.\n• Her diagnoses include Autism Spectrum Disorder;\nAdjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct; Conduct\nDisorder Unspecified; Cognitive Impairment.\n• Youth A’s 9/21/2022-12/19/2022 Updated Service Plan that\nshowed a 10/3/2022 social work contact related to Youth\nA’s ABA therapy reducing from 9-15 hours weekly to two\nhours weekly due to staffing issue, and the director\nproviding those limited services. Also, a 10/14/2022\nconcern by Foster Parent B, denoting Youth A is regressing\nwithout the full ABA services; and it being unfair that Youth\nA must wait on a wait list. Additionally, a 11/7/2022 social\nwork contact home visit contact reporting by Foster Parent\nB repeating that Youth A is regressing due to the ABA\nservice pause. He is looking to get Youth A into a provider\nwith a shorter wait list.\n• An Early Autism service transfer report showing:\n➢ Youth A date of admission as 2/1/2022 and date of\nthe transfer plan as 10/12/2022.\n➢ Youth A was referred for ABA therapy services due\nto concerns of aggressive and impulsive behavior.\nShe received an autism evaluation and confirmed\ndiagnosis through Monroe County CMH.\n➢ The reason for transition indicated Youth A’s\ntreatment has been on hold since August of 2022,\ndue to a lack of staff. The program’s clinical director\nhas provided check in visits since the leave of her\nprevious providers to maintain continuity of care. At\nthis time, Youth A is transitioning from the care of\nthe current program, Autism Family Partnership\n(AFP), to their sister program, Early Autism\n8",
    "Services, due to the ABA program’s clinical director\nleaving. Also, that currently, the program does not\nhave a BCBA available to service Youth A’s case;\nand she will remain on the waitlist for service\nproviders with Early Autism Services until staff are\navailable or an alternative program with availability\nis identified.\n➢ Youth A’s case manager at Monroe Community\nMental Health has been contacted and updated of\nher status with the program. The Clinical Director is\navailable for coordination of care if another service\nprovider is identified.\nAnalysis Based on the interviews and documents reviewed there is\ninsufficient evidence to support that the agency did not provide or\nseek to provide services for Youth A. Nor that there was a lack of\nwork with the child, family, or relevant individuals related to the\nservice plan.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nII. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\nMay 2, 2023\n__________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 9, 2023\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n9"
