    "summary": "An altercation occurred at the Wolverine Center where Youth A was assaulted by Youth B and Youth C, leading Youth A to defend himself with a broomstick. Staff intervened but video evidence showed improper restraint by Staff 2 on Youth C and Staff 4 shoving Youth B. The facility was found in compliance regarding sufficiency of staff but violated intervention standards and restraint policies, with multiple repeat violations. Culpability lies with the facility for failing to enforce proper restraint procedures despite prior corrective actions.",

  "sir_violation_level": {
    "level": "severe",
    "justification": "The substantiated violations involve a youth-on-youth physical assault where a youth was tackled and struck, and staff used unsafe and prohibited physical interventions. Specifically, a staff member improperly restrained a youth (violation of R 400.4159) and another staff member shoved a youth during an intervention (violation of R 400.4158). The incident required police and EMS response. These findings fall under the 'Severe' category due to 'staff-on-youth violence' (shoving and improper restraint) and 'physical assault' (youth-on-youth). The failure to document the restraint (R 400.4163) is a related procedural failure stemming from the serious incident."
