Unknown to the youth, DHHS,\nand the youth's mother, the facility refused to give the youth their\nprescribed psychotropic medication without consulting a doctor.\nThe facility did not titrate or wean the youth off the medication as\nrequired.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on May 8, 2025,\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Complainant said Youth\nA’s behaviors have decompensated severely since stopping his\nmedications.

    "Youth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on May\n13, 2025. Youth A said he is prescribed Seroquel for Borderline\nPersonality Disorder, and Multiple Personality Disorder. Youth A\nsaid he was provided Seroquel for the first two days at Saginaw\nDetention. However, when Nurse came into work on the following\nMonday, she discontinued Seroquel, and he has not been\nprovided with it since. Youth A said the doctor that prescribed him\nSeroquel told him he cannot stop taking it as it will be harmful to\nhim. Youth A denied being given any other medication in place of\nthe Seroquel and denied being weaned off it slowly. Youth A said\nafter being taken off Seroquel he was having hot/cold sweats,\nhallucinations, and did not sleep for three to four days. Youth A\nsaid he is also prescribed Adderall twice per day and was not\nconsistently getting his afternoon dose.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on May 21,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 5 said he\ndoes not dispense Youth A’s medications. Staff 5 said he has\nheard Youth A refuse to take his medications due to them not\nproviding him with “all his meds”. Staff 5 said he is unsure what\nmedications Youth A is not being given. Staff 5 denied seeing\nYouth A have any withdraw symptoms. Staff 5 said Youth A is\ncapable of advocating for what he needs and will do so often.\nStaff 2, Staff 6, Staff 7 and Staff 8 were interviewed face-to-\nface at the facility on May 21, 2025, in collaboration with\nMDHHS Worker. Staff 2, Staff 6, Staff 7, Staff 8 said they do not\nhave any knowledge of Youth A’s medications. Staff 6 and Staff 7\nsaid they have not seen Youth A going through any withdrawals.\nStaff 9 and Staff 10 were interviewed via telephone on June 2,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 9 and Staff 10\nsaid they have seen Youth A be given medications; however, they\nhave never dispensed the medications and is unsure what Youth\nA is prescribed. Staff 9 and Staff 10 said he has not seen Youth A\nhave any withdraw symptoms and has not seen or heard of any\nsleeping issues he is experiencing.\nStaff 12 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on May 21,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 12 said he\nhas provided Youth A medications on occasion and each time\nYouth A would make a comment that he was supposed to have\nadditional medications that he was not being provided with but\nnever told him the name of the medication. Staff 12 said Youth A\nwould sometimes refuse his medications. Staff 12 said he has not\n3",
    "seen or heard of Youth A having any withdrawal symptoms,\nincluding hot/cold sweats, shaking, or sleeping issues.\nStaff 13 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on May 13,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. A follow-up\ninterview was conducted face-to-face at the facility on June\n17, 2025. Staff 13 said Youth A arrived at the facility on April 17,\n2025, and during the intake process he reported he receives\nmultiple medications and is schizophrenic. Staff 13 said Youth A’s\nmedications came in the original bottles. Staff 13 took them and\ncontacted Nurse to notify her of what medications Youth A was\ntaking. Nurse provided directions on when and how to dispense\nthe medications. Staff 13 said she provided Youth A a night\nmedication the first night he was there however Nurse came into\nthe facility the next day and Youth A no longer had a nighttime\nmedication. Staff 13 said she was not part of determining what\nmedications Youth A would remain on or discontinue. Staff 13 said\nYouth A never complained to her about not getting his\nmedications, never said he was unable to sleep, and she did not\nnotice any signs of withdrawals with Youth A. Staff 13 said Youth\nA is very capable of verbalizing anything he needs and advocating\nfor himself. Staff 13 said Youth A told her that he has a second\npersonality “Bob” that comes out whenever he is stressed,\nhowever she denied seeing this personality.\nNurse was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on May 21,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Nurse said she is\nemployed by Wellpath, which is a company contracted to provide\nmedical treatment to the youth at Saginaw Detention Center.\nNurse said Youth A was placed at the detention center on the\nweekend and Staff 13 called to notify her of the placement and\nmedications. Nurse said Doctor was out of the country at that\ntime, so no medication changes were made over the weekend.\nNurse said that when she arrived to work on the following\nMonday, she reviewed Youth A’s medications and “packed them”\nfor daily distribution. Nurse reported she contacted Doctor who\ndiscontinued Youth A's Seroquel but made no other changes.\nNurse said Seroquel is a “non-formulary” medication that Wellpath\ndoes not prescribe. Nurse said she was told Seroquel is a sleep\nmedication and they do not treat sleep issues. Nurse said Youth A\nwas prescribed Adderall in the morning and afternoon, however\nfor the first week of his placement she did not realize he had the\nafternoon dose and did not provide it to him. Nurse said once she\ncaught her error, Youth A was given the second dose of Adderall.\nNurse said Youth A did not come to the facility with enough\nAdderall to last 30 days, so she was working with Foster Care\n4",
    "Worker on getting a refill. Nurse said Foster Care Worker told her\nsince Youth A was no longer in their county the prescribing doctor\nwould not issue refills. Nurse said Foster Care Worker suggested\nusing Saginaw County CMH however CMH said due to Youth A\nbeing placed in the detention that is considered a “short stay”, and\nthey would not add him to their caseload to prescribe him\nmedications. Nurse said Doctor was not willing to refill the\nAdderall because it is a controlled substance. Youth A was only\ngoing to be there a short time so there would be no follow up, and\nDoctor is not a psychiatrist. Nurse said Youth A is not going to\nschool at the facility and so “does not really need it.” Nurse said\nYouth A is also prescribed Zyprexa as a PRN and has been taking\nthat at nighttime.\nDoctor was interviewed via telephone on June 2, 2025, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Doctor said he was unable\nto discuss client specific concerns due to confidentiality, however,\nwas willing to discuss the processes that are used at Saginaw\nDetention Center. Doctor said he is employed through Wellpath\nand contracted to provide medical services at Saginaw Detention\nCenter. Doctor said Seroquel is not on the formulary list and\ntherefore not approved for his distribution. Doctor said the\ncontracted pharmacy they use does not carry Seroquel as it is\nused as a sleep aid and not FDA approved for use in children.\nDoctor said Nurse sends him a list of medications that youth are\nprescribed, and he gives the directive for which medications are\ngiven to the youth. Doctor said there are no withdrawal symptoms\nfrom ending Seroquel so there would be no issue stopping it\nabruptly. Doctor said all psychiatric care would need to be done\nthrough a psychiatrist as he only sees youth for medical issues\nsuch as well-child exams and minor injuries. Doctor said he would\nnot prescribe or refill a prescription for Adderall as that would need\nto be done through a psychiatrist.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Offender Note for Youth A was reviewed. The note was\ndated April 22, 2025, and stated “Pt takes Seroquel 25mg\nQAM and Seroquel 400mg QHS [Doctor] will not continue\nthe Seroquel while in the facility. This is a drug we don’t\ngive.”\n• Medication Administration Record for Youth A was\nreviewed. Youth A was not provided with his 12pm dose of\nAdderall 15mg from April 17, 2025, until May 10, 2025.\nYouth A’s Adderall prescription ran out on May 15, 2025,\nand was not refilled during his placement at Saginaw\nDetention which ended on May 21, 2025.\n5",
    "• A review of the FDA website showed Seroquel is approved\nfor adolescents ages 13-17.\n• A review of Wellpath “Formulary Medication” document was\nreviewed. The documented included all of the approved\nmedications and Seroquel was not included on that list. The\ndocument outlines how Wellpath determines which\nmedications are included on the list which states, “We\nconcur and evaluate medications for the formulary based\non use, effect, and adverse drug effects to promote rational\ncost-effective use in the population(s) that we serve.” In\naddition, there is a process outlined for the use of non-\nformulary medications which states, “Non-formulary\nmedication requests and rationale for use (completed by\nprescriber) are reviewed by a Wellpath Regional Medical\nDirector, The Chief of Psychiatry for Corrections, or his\ndesignee. These requests will either be: approved; returned\nwith an alternative recommendation for; or there will be a\nrequest for additional information in order to further\nevaluate.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per staff and youth\ninterviews and documentation review, Youth A was not provided\nhis Adderall as prescribed between April 17, 2025, and May 10,\n2025, and then again after May 15, 2025.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTechnical assistance was provided for Saginaw Detention Center\nto explore options for youth psychiatric care. Wellpath indicated\npsychiatric care would need to be done through a psychiatrist as\nWellpath only sees youth for medical issues. There is concern\nyouth are admitted into the short-term program and although\nWellpath indicated they do not provide psychiatric care, they do\ndiscontinue medications and do not refill previously prescribed\nmedications that youth were prescribed when entering care.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10177 Resident restraint\nSection (1) The facility shall establish and follow written policy and\nDescription procedures specifying the use of resident restraint.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Incident 1: The youth was choked during a restraint on 4/17/2025.\nAdditional Allegation Incident 2: The youth was inappropriately\nrestrained on 4/29/2025.\n6",

Staff 1 stated, \"Everything was fine. Cool,\ncalm, and collected\" denying ever getting upset or frustrated with\nYouth A. Staff 1 said eventually he and Staff 2 placed Youth A in a\n7",
    "standing Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) hold, with one staff on\neither side of Youth A holding his arms, to escort him to his room\nbecause he would not leave intake. Staff 1 said once Youth A was\nout of the intake room, he was compliant and there were no\nfurther issues. Staff 1 said Youth A was saying “stuff” towards the\nstaff, but he was not able to remember any specific statements.\nStaff 1 said he recalled Youth A spitting at staff throughout the\nprocess as well. Staff 1 denied ever cursing or saying anything to\nprovoke Youth A throughout the process. Staff 1 said Youth A\nwas from out of county and it is not uncommon for there to be\nmore resistance from youth from other counties. Staff 1 said he\nbelieves all staff responded exactly how they were trained, and\nthey followed policy throughout this incident. Staff 1 said the\nrestraints done were “proper” and he did not have any concerns\nwith any of the staff's responses with Youth A during this incident.\nStaff 1 said “we had so many staff\" helping that the restraint was\neffective and there was no resistance from Youth A or any\nadjustments that staff had to make throughout the process. Staff\n1 denied ever hitting Youth A throughout the process. Staff 1\ndenied Youth A having any injuries after the incident, not even\naccidentally due to the restraint. Staff 1 denied Youth A ever\ncomplained about not being able to breathe. Staff 1 confirmed\nstaff were able to get a smock on Youth A but denied there was a\ntime Youth A tripped staff or there were issues with breathing\nonce the smock was put on. Staff 1 denied any times his\nbehaviors have become excessive with any youth, stating he has\na good relationship with the youth and just try to “show them love”\nwhen he works.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on May 21,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 said he was\ncalled by Staff 13 to come to the intake area and assist Staff 1\nwith Youth A. Staff 2 said when he arrived at intake Staff 1 was\nexplaining the expectations and intake process to Youth A who\nwas being hostile and refusing to comply with directions. Staff 2\nsaid he tried to take over talking with Youth A and it did not\nchange anything, and he continued to be threatening and refused\nto comply with directions. Staff 2 said it was decided Youth A did\nnot need to complete any of the intake process and walk to his\nroom. Youth A still refused even that and would not move. Staff 2\nsaid Youth A was fully dressed sitting by the shower doors and\nrefused to move. Staff 2 said Staff 13 said he needed to get up\nand gave him the choice to walk to his room and he responded,\n“fuck this nigger” and he was going to sit there all night. Staff 2\nsaid Staff 13 gave the directive to Staff 1 and Staff 2 to escort\nYouth A. Staff 2 said he once again gave Youth A the option to\n8",
    "walk on his own and Youth A said no so he and Staff 2 each took\none of Youth A’s arms and began to walk him out of intake. Staff 2\nsaid Youth A resisted and caused them all to fall forward onto the\nground. Staff 2 said Youth A grabbed and pulled his hair and\nYouth A was let go. Staff 2 said Staff 13 called for additional staff\nassistance and Youth A stood up, so Staff 1 and Staff 2 placed\nhim in a standing hold with one of them on each side of Youth A\nholding his arms. Staff 2 said he and Staff 1 began to move\nforward and Youth A fell backward on to Staff 13 and then ended\nup on the ground again. Staff 2 said Staff 3 arrived to assist and\ntook over for Staff 1. Staff 2 said Youth A was lying on his back on\nthe ground. Staff 2 was sitting with his knees on either side of\nYouth A’s elbows with his arm on Youth A’s shoulder to secure\ncontrol of Youth A. Staff 2 said he continued to try to verbally\ndeescalate Youth A. However, he was very upset screaming\nobscenities and racial comments. Staff 2 said he, Staff 1, Staff 3,\nand Staff 13 were able to get Youth A on his feet and then he\nkicked Staff 3. Staff 4 arrived to help, and they all got knocked\nback to the ground due to Youth A struggling and his momentum\ntaking them down. Staff 2 said Staff 13 brought out a suicide\nsmock and he, Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 13 “tussled” with Youth A\nto get his clothing off and got him to his underwear and got the\nsmock on him. Staff 2 said the thinking was the suicide smock\nwas heavy so might help wear Youth A out a bit so they could get\nhim to his room. Staff 2 said this whole process took about 20\nminutes and then they finally were able to escort Youth A out of\nthe intake room and into the hallway. Staff 2 said Youth A fell back\nonce again on Staff 13 and kicked Staff 3 for a second time. Staff\n2 said he and Staff 1 were able to get Youth A up on his feet by\nlifting him under his arms. Staff 2 said Staff 3 took over securing\nhis arms and Staff 2 was working on controlling Youth A’s legs\nfrom kicking out at staff. Staff 2 said in the process Youth A\n“headbutted” him, so he stepped back. Staff 2 said Youth A finally\nstarted to tire out and began walking down the hallway. Staff 2\nsaid he took over for Staff 3 and he and Staff 1 were walking\nYouth A. Staff 2 said Youth A hooked his legs around Staff 2’s leg\nand they lowered Youth A down to his knees so he could get his\nleg free. Then they stood him back up and Youth A walked with\nthem the rest of the way to his room. Staff 2 said Youth A walked\ninto his room and was released. Staff left and shut the door. Staff\n2 said he debriefed with Staff 13 and then went back to his unit for\nthe remainder of the shift. Staff 2 said he never saw Staff 1 place\nhis hands around Youth A’s neck. Staff 2 said Youth A said he\ncould not breathe several times throughout the incident and\nwhenever he said that the staff would reposition, stop what they\nwere doing, or sit him up. Staff 2 said he never saw any staff with\n9",
    "their knees on Youth A’s neck. Staff 2 said he never saw Staff 1\npunch Youth A. Staff 2 said Youth A had some scratches on his\narm and Staff 13 provided him with Band-Aids. Staff 2 denied\nYouth A have any major injuries from the incident.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via telephone on June 12, 2025, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 said she was called\ndown to the intake area and as she was walking down the\nhallway, she could hear Staff 1 cussing and yelling. Staff 3 said\nwhen she entered the room Youth A was undressed and being\nheld on the ground by Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 13. Staff 3 said\nshe told Staff 1 to be quiet and stop going back and forth with\nYouth A because he was making things worse. Staff 3 said Youth\nA “headbutted” Staff 2 however he continued to keep Youth A in a\nproper hold. Staff 3 said Staff 1 started calling Youth A “little bitch”\nand “motherfucker” over and over. Staff 3 said Staff 1 held Youth\nA by the neck and punched him with a closed fist in the head at\nleast three times. Staff 3 said she and Staff 13 were both telling\nStaff 1 to stop and he stopped hitting him but kept calling him\nnames. Staff 3 said Staff 13 got Youth A into the suicide smock\nand Staff 1 and Staff 3 were able to stand Youth A up and move\nhim into the hallway. Staff 3 said as they were moving down the\nhallway Youth A used his legs to wrap around Staff 3’s leg and\nshe was unable to move until Staff 4 arrived and helped get Youth\nA’s legs off hers. Staff 3 said Youth A began to call them “niggers”\nwhich set Staff 1 off again and he was yelling and cussing at\nYouth A. Staff 3 said they were finally able to get Youth A into his\nroom and shut the door. Staff 3 said Youth A had been\ncomplaining of not being able to breathe throughout the incident\nhowever she never saw anyone restricting his airway and believes\nit was just from “all the chaos”. Staff 3 said she did not see any\nmarks or bruises on Youth A after the incident. Staff 1 is “hard to\nreach as a staff” and engages in many power struggles and verbal\narguments with youth. Staff 3 said she has never seen him\nphysically hurt a youth until that day when he was “acting like he\nwas in a street fight”. Staff 3 said her concerns about this incident\nwere brought up to Staff 13, the supervisor on duty that night.\nStaff 3 said Director and Assistant Administrator are aware of the\nconcerns with Staff 1 engaging in verbal arguments with the youth\nat the facility.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via telephone on May 28, 2025, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker.

Staff 4 said when she returned with the scissors Youth A\n10",
    "was laying on the ground on his back kicking, yelling, calling Staff\n1 a “nigger”, pulling Staff 2’s hair and hitting Staff 13. Staff 4 said\nshe left to go do a round of checks on all the other youth and\nwhen she got back Youth A’s pants were down to his knees and\nhe was still resisting and fighting against Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff\n13. Staff 4 said she left to do another round of checks and when\nshe returned Youth A had been placed in the suicide smock. Staff\n1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 13 were in the hallway. Youth A was\nsitting on Staff 13’s back while Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 were\nverbally trying to convince Youth A to get off Staff 13. Staff 4 said\nshe left for another round of checks and when she returned Youth\nA was standing with Staff 2 on one side of him and Staff 3 on the\nother side of him. Staff 4 said Youth A had his leg wrapped around\nStaff 3’s leg and Staff 1 and Staff 13 were holding Staff 3 up and\nverbally encouraging Youth A to release her leg.

Staff 13\nsaid she sent Staff 2 into the shower area to assist Staff 1 in\n“motivating” Youth A to complete the intake process, and she\nstood outside the door. Staff 13 said Youth A continued to get\n“worked up” and began to refuse to do anything but sit on the\nfloor. Staff 13 said she returned to the intake room and Youth A\nwas given several opportunities to walk to his room, even without\nshowering or changing his clothing, however he refused. Staff 13\nsaid Youth A was calling names, using derogatory statements,\nand racial comments towards staff. Staff 13 said Staff 1 was\n“reacting” to what Youth A was saying however could not\nremember exactly what Staff 1 was saying. Staff 13 said she kept\nsaying “stay focused” to Staff 1 throughout the situation as he was\nvery frustrated with Youth A. Staff 13 said she was not able to\nremove Staff 1 from the situation as she needed him to help\n11",
