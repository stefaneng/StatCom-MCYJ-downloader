    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Initial documentation\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4152\nSection (1) At the time of admission, all of the following shall be in the\nDescription resident’s case record:\n(g) Authorization to provide medical, dental, and surgical care\nand treatment as provided in section 14 a (1), (2), and (3) of 1973\nPA 116, MCL 722.124a.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 6/14/24 facility staff brought Youth K to the hospital without the\nrequired documents.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI notified Chief Administrator of the allegation.\nOn 6/18/24 I notified Complainant of the investigation assignment\nby email and attempted to reach her by phone to no avail.\nI interviewed Hospital Social Worker on 6/20/24. She indicated an\nunidentified staff from Christ Child House brought Youth K to the\nhospital for a psychiatric evaluation on 6/14/24 without his medical\nauthorization card and a court order. The unidentified staff texted\nthe facility and was able to produce the medical authorization card\nin a timely manner. However, Hospital Social Worker said the\nthird-party evaluator also requires a court order which was not\nprovided and delayed the referral process. While waiting for the\ncourt order, Hospital Social Worker ended up obtaining permission\ndirectly from Youth K’s father. Youth K was evaluated and\nreleased back to Christ Child House the next morning.\nI notified Youth K’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation\nassignment. She had no information to provide relative to the\nallegation.\nI interviewed Staff 1 onsite on 6/20/24. She has worked at the\nfacility for one year. Staff 1 said on 6/14/24 at 2pm Residential\nDirector asked her to pick Youth K up from school and transport\nhim to Children’s Hospital because the school told her he had\nthoughts of suicide.\n2",
    "Staff 1 said she was aware of the hospital admission process\nbecause had taken several other youths there for psychiatric\nevaluations. Staff 1 said she provided a copy of the medical\nauthorization card within ten minutes after Complainant requested\nit. She said Complainant acknowledged receipt of the card and\nrequested no additional documents. Staff 1 remained at the\nhospital with Youth K until 6/15/24 at 7am when she was relieved\nby another staff.\nI interviewed Clinical Director at the facility on 6/20/24. She said\nYouth K has been to the hospital four times recently for psychiatric\nevaluations (4/7/24, 4/12/23, 6/9/24 and 6/14/24). Clinical Director\nindicated that medical authorization cards are kept in the\nchildren’s medical files and are available to staff afterhours for\nemergencies. However, she said Christ Child House does not\nalways receive copies of the court orders from the referral source\nand hospitals have never asked for them before this complaint\nwas filed.\nAt my request, Clinical Director contacted Children’s Hospital\nSocial Work Department Supervisor on 6/21/24. She said the\nHospital Social Work Supervisor told her Children’s Hospital\nneeds a court order identifying the child’s guardian and legal\nstatus. They can no longer accept the word of CCI staff as to who\nis legally responsible to sign consents – either parent/guardian or\nMDHHS. Children’s Hospital now needs the court order at check-\nin to minimize delays in any processes for mental health\nscreenings or otherwise. Previously the third-party assessor\ncompleted the mental health screenings without consent from\nlegal guardian/MDHHS and consent was only required if in-patient\ntreatment was recommended.\nGiven the apparent new change in documents required by\nChildren’s Hospital and the third-party contractor, moving forward\nthe Chief Administrator and Clinical Director committed to\ndiligently attempting to obtain all court orders from MDHHS foster\ncare workers identifying guardianship of current children placed at\nthe facility. They also plan to assure they have said court order\nprior to the placement of children to their facility.\nThe facility does not have a written procedure listing the specific\ndocuments staff must present when checking a youth in for\ntreatment at a hospital.\nDocuments reviewed:\n3",
    "Medical authorization card dated 6/1/24, which provides consent\nto the routine, non-surgical medical care and emergency\nmedical/surgical treatment of Youth K.\nAnalysis There is no licensing rule requiring CCI’s to maintain court orders\nidentifying guardianship in the child’s records.\nStaff 1 provided Complainant with a copy of Youth K’s medical\nauthorization card in a timely manner, but neither Staff 1 nor the\nfacility had Youth K’s court order so it could not be provided to the\nhospital at the time of check-in.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJuly 11, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 15, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n4"
