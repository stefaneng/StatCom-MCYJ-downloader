TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The agency has multiple case records containing youth information. It is\nrecommended that youth have one uniform file per the licensing rule.\n3",
    "• The agency has multiple records containing employee information (i.e. one file in\nHuman Resources and one file and/or other documents on-site at the facility). It is\nrecommended that employees have one complete file per the licensing rule.\n• It is recommended the agency follow a consistent process for new employees to\nensure all licensing requirements are met prior to hire and prior to assumption of\nduties.\n• All requested items need to be accessible and on-site on the day of the audit.\n• One staff file reviewed for an employee over 12 months had an annual evaluation\nnot in this period of review. The annual review was dated 1/1/21-12/31/21 but was\nnot dated by the supervisor until 2/9/22 and was not dated by the employee until\n3/12/22. The facility must complete, sign and date annual evaluations by January\n31st as required.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• The agency was notified as part of the quarterly unannounced visit they needed\nto complete their next fire drill during 3rd shift.\n• The agency was notified as part of the quarterly unannounced visit the spare fire\nextinguisher in the staff office was last inspected in January 2022 and needed to\nbe updated this month. In addition, the agency was notified the fire extinguisher\nmust remain stored at least 4 inches off the ground.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP was in response to two violations\nreceived during their 2022 Interim Inspection. They have implemented the CAP and\nno further issues have been identified when transferring a youth from one Bethany\nprogram to another such as health screening and grievience procedures.\nChief Administrator (CA) Assessment:\nCA noted there have been no barriers or systemic factors that have impacted rule\ncompliance. CA noted COVID positive staff challenge the agency’s ability to stay in\nratio, but the case manager and therapist continue to help by covering shifts as\nneeded. CA reported during the last inspection, there were two rules they were found\nin violation for related to missing documents due to youth transferring between\nBethany programs, and they have resolved both violations successfully. CA noted\nthey had an increase in AWOL episodes for youth and are continuing to explore ways\nto increase engagement in program participation. CA reported they continue to\nstruggle to fill youth specialist positions, but they are continuing efforts by partnering\nwith Human Resources, posting openings on social media and peer recruitment. CA\nreported they are working with USCCB and ORR to secure additional referrals and\nprovide services to additional youth since the agency’s capacity has increased to 12\nyouth. CA noted the agency will have bi-weekly team meetings to review applicable\n4",
    "policies and procedures as well as share program progress to allow for adjustments\nto programming as needed.\nStaff and Youth Interviews:\nYouth and staff interviews were very positive. The youth did not have any concerns or\ncomplaints to report. They feel very supported and safe at Bellaview. They feel staff\nmeet their needs and are very kind. Staff reported they feel Bellaview, as well as\nBethany Christian Services, are very supportive agencies. They feel they can go to\nupper management to express concerns and feel their concerns are heard and acted\nupon. One concern noted was a continued lack of communication, which was also\nnoted during the quarterly unannounced visit in October 2022. Staff noted there are a\nlack of defined roles amongst staff. Staff are feeling overwhelmed without having\nestablished and defined roles or knowing who to report to for certain issues. For\nexample, staff reported Youth Specialist meetings used to occur bi-weekly and those\nare no longer occurring. As a result, there have been communication gaps between\nstaff. Staff feel implementing the biweekly youth specialist meetings could improve\nthe communication between staff, which will in turn positively effect staff interactions\nand consistency with youth. However, it is unknown who should be initiating and\norganizing those meetings as well as who should hold staff accountable to attend.\nFinancial Overview:\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on a review of the facility’s budget\nand the agency’s financial audit.\nPREA Compliance (if applicable):\nNot Applicable\nDescription of Agency Walkthrough:\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of the facility occurred on January 17, 2023.\nThere were no issues or safety concerns noted.\n5",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 25, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 26, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
