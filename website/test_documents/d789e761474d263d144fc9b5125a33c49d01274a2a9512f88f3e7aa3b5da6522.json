(See JRM 202 RESIDENTIAL SCREENING AND ASSESSMENTS: Sex\nOffender Assessments)\nTwo of two applicable youth files reviewed did not contain documentation of use\nof a sex offender assessment tool as outlined in contract and policy. The facility\nreported that they were administering the assessment at a certain stage of their\nprogram. This is not in line with the required timeframes. REPEAT VIOLATION,\nRenewal Report, 07/21/21, and corresponding CAP, 08/11/21. The facility\nmust identify why the previous CAPs failed and how they will ensure\ncompliance. Despite the repeat violation, this is an improvement from the last\ninspection where there was a missing screening for one youth.

    "RFCJJ Contract: Treatment Plans\nThe Contractor must conduct individualized youth treatment planning in\naccordance with JRM 201, Residential Treatment Plans, Reentry Plans and\nRelease Reports and linked policies.\nTwo of three current youth files contained updated treatment plans that did not\nhave the youth signature.\nRFCJJ Contract The Contractor shall ensure that applicable CCI staff has access\nto the Michigan Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System\n(MiSACWIS) through a web-based interface, henceforth referred to as the\n“MiSACWIS application.”\nReporting:\n4) The Contractor must maintain youth case record in accordance with the\nadministrative rules for Child Caring Institutions, Mich Admin Code R\n400.4101-4666 and must be responsible for maintaining an up-to-date\nelectronic case record for juvenile justice MDHHS-supervised youth in\nthe MiSACWIS system including, but not limited to:\nf) Social Work Contacts.\ng) Clinical Case Notes.\nh) Treatment Plans and Release Reports (Mich Admin Code R\n400.4155-400.4156).\ni) Assessments and Assessment Scores.\nThe facility is noncompliant with the contract as the clinical staff have not been\nentering or uploading all required documentation to MiSACWIS. This includes\nsocial work contacts, clinical case notes, treatment plans, release reports,\nassessments and assessment scores as observed. Treatment plans and release\nreports were completed on Word documents instead of in the system. The facility\nprovided some documentation of having contacted MiSACWIS helpdesk for\nassistance, however, this issue has been ongoing for an extended period, and it\ndoes not appear the facility administration ensured that the staff were appropriately\nset up in the system once previous staff, who had access, left. Some functionality\nhas been restored but they are still working to get cases assigned in order to be\nfully operational. The CAP for this item must report how the facility is going ensure\nall applicable staff get the access they need in a timely manner and include a plan\nfor ensuring ongoing access should staff turnover.\n8",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR 116(2)(a): The Chief Administrator did one annual assessment from 10/01/19-\n10/01/20 and then did the next 01/01/21-12/31/21, which resulted in omitting October,\nNovember and December 2020 from the most recent review. The last assessment\ncontained an in-depth review, but the Chief Administrator must ensure there are no\ngaps if changing the period.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nIt is highly recommended that all employees are certified in CPR and First Aid.\nIt was recommended that upon return to a regular license status, and the facility\nplacement suspension lifted, that the facility administration work strategically with\nMDHHS as they begin taking new placements again, to ensure there is sufficient\nstaffing to comply with ratio and safety standards.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect and\ncorporal punishment during this licensing period (same incident).\nThe substantiated child abuse and the substantiated use of corporal punishment\noccurred in the same incident. SIR 2022C0207002, 11/17/21, and corresponding\nCAP, signed 12/16/21, noted a violation for R 158(2) for using corporal punishment.\nIn this case, the involved staff acknowledged biting the youth during the incident when\nthe youth attacked her as a reflexive/instinctive reaction instead of using her Handle\nwith Care training. The facility was also cited for R 112(4) as this staff demonstrated\nshe was not able to perform her job duties. Additionally, the DHHS Specialist deemed\nthe staff unsuitable. Finally, the facility was cited for R 131 as they failed to report the\nincident to Centralized Intake. The involved staff was terminated, and the facility\nimplemented trainings on mandated reporting and use of physical management. They\nhave been compliant with their CAP terms thus far as evidenced in their records and\ndocumentation.\nThe facility had only one investigation during this period under review\n(compared to 42 in the 18 months prior to this). They submitted 4 acceptable\ncorrective action plans not related to maltreatment during this licensing period\n(3 were for investigations completed during the prior licensing period).\nSIR 2021C0207030, 11/01/21, and corresponding CAP, signed 12/16/21, found the\nfacility in violation of R 150(3) due to not reporting an AWOL youth per the rule\n9",
    "requirement. This youth did not return to the facility from a home pass. The facility\nhas completed the CAP.\nSIR 2021C0207029, 11/03/21, and corresponding CAP, signed 12/16/21, cited three\nsections of R 159 in violation of restraint requirements. In this incident the youth’s\nbehaviors, although escalated, did not present an immediate risk of injury to anyone.\nThe staff were observed providing space for Youth A until Youth A squirted\nmayonnaise on a manager. This does not qualify as justification for physical restraint.\nAdditionally, the manger was observed on the video review to not use proper Handle\nwith Care technique during the escort to the youth’s room. The manager was\nobserved with his arm over the youth’s shoulder at one point and grabbing the back of\nthe youth’s jumper as well. Another staff was also observed grabbing the youth by the\nback of his jumper. The two staff pushed the youth into his bedroom. An escort is\npermitted but the youth must be walking on their own and not being forced to move\nwhile resisting, as occurred in this instance. The staff should have put the youth in a\nproper two person standing restraint until he was cooperative to walk. Additionally,\nthis restraint incident report was completed by a manager and should have been\nreviewed prior to submission. If a proper review had occurred, the non-compliances\ncould have been addressed by the facility. The facility was also cited for a violation of\ntheir contract due to not providing all required therapy sessions and not documenting\ntherapy sessions. Additionally, the facility was cited for R 109(1)(c) because they did\nnot follow their phone call policy as they were monitoring youth phone calls with\nworkers. Finally, the facility was cited for R 132(1) for not replacing one missing\ngrievance box on one pod, nor a damaged grievance box on another pod. This CAP\nis being actively monitored and thus far, the facility is compliant.\nSIR 2022C0207002, 11/17/21, and corresponding CAP, signed 12/16/21-see notes in\nabove section.\nSIR 2022C0207010, dated 01/05/22, with corresponding CAP, signed 02/17/22,\nnoted a violation for a repeat violation of R 131 as four staff had knowledge of the\nyouth’s allegation that a staff touched him inappropriately and did not report it to\nCentralized Intake. The incident was eventually reported, when the youth mentioned it\nto a DHHS PREA analyst who told the Director. The CAP was approved 02/22/22 and\nwill be monitored for compliance during the upcoming biweekly visits and quarterly\nCAP reviews. Although this was a repeat violation for a safety related rule, additional\nadverse licensing action was not recommended due to the overlapping timeframe of\nthe repeat violation, the recent approval of the previous CAP, as well as the change in\nleadership that occurred in October 2021 which has markedly improved the culture\nand compliance for the program.\nDuring this period, the facility has changed Directors and there is a notable\nimprovement in oversight and accountability which has improved the programming\nand decreased complaints, restraints, and seclusions. During this period there were\nonly 12 restraints and 2 seclusions. All restraints are reviewed for documentation and\nthere has been improvement in the content and accuracy of the documentation.\n10",
    "Weekly visits have been occurring since June 2021 and were reduced to biweekly in\nJanuary 2022 due to the progress at the facility. During these visits interviews were\ndone with youth and staff at all levels and typically includes direct care staff. During\nthis inspection, the interview focus was on administrative and supervisory staff. Youth\nare consistently reporting increased programming and use of the facility services,\nconsistent individual and group therapy sessions, improved facility maintenance, and\nincreased communication with staff and administration. The student council has been\nreinstituted and the youth report participating, feeling concerns are heard and\naddressed, and indicate the climate in the program has improved. Staff interviews\nincluded staff in various positions and levels of authority. Staff morale appears\nimproved with fewer complaints, although staff report increased wages is still their\nnumber one need. There have been no observed or reported issues with maintaining\nratio. The Director reports that some mandatory overtime continues when needed,\nbut they are monitoring who they keep over to reduce burnout and fatigue.\nThe facility has improved in their implementation of CAPs and in the transparency\nwith the Department. They have been working on several active CAPs from the prior\nperiod and have completed the majority of them during this period. Areas of focus\nwere proper restraint methods and use of verbal de-escalation, mandated reporting\nrequirements, maintaining ratio, staff supervision, and following facility policies. To\naddress these issues numerous staff trainings have occurred, meetings are\nstructured to address the issues and provide oversight, the quality assurance\nmanager has been enlisted to provide additional oversight to various areas, and the\nnew Director has provided increased structure, reinstituted programming, ensures\nfollow through, and requires accountability. Additionally, they have resolved physical\nplant issues that resulted in prior violations. The work and completion of these CAPs\nappears to have made a direct positive impact on the program as evidenced by the\nreduced number of investigations and violations in this period (one new complaint this\nperiod). They have also actively participated with the Residential Collaboration and\nTechnical Assistance Unit, and that has been reported as a successful and beneficial\npartnership by both the RCTAU staff and the facility administration.\nThe Chief Administrator Annual Assessment was thorough and identified ongoing\nneeds within the program. Although this inspection report outlines a number of\nviolations, there are 15 in this report when compared to 22 in the last report. There\nare also several repeat violations, but the number of occurrences on most were\nsignificantly lower than the last inspection. Five of the violations were for an isolated\nincident that was found in one applicable file. Employee files were markedly\nimproved, although violations continued. The clinical team had significant turnover\nand resulted in MiSACWIS access issues which directly impacted their performance\nas well. In summary, the facility has been observed making significant efforts to\nimprove their compliance and improve their services. Ongoing monitoring of CAP\ncompliance will continue to assist them in their follow through.\n11",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nMarch 22, 2022, Amended 04/19/22\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 23, 2022, Amended 04/19/22\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n12"
