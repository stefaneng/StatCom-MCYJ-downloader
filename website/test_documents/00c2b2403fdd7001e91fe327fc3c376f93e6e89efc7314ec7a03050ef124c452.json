    "summary": "The investigation found that Catholic Charities West Michigan failed to properly monitor and document the medical condition of a youth (Youth A) in their care, who suffered significant health deterioration including weight loss, weakness, and pressure sores. The agency violated multiple licensing rules, with repeat violations in staff qualifications, service plan documentation, and case file management, indicating a pattern of non-compliance. The Foster Care Worker and agency oversight bear clear culpability for neglecting timely follow-up and accurate record-keeping, leading to the youth's unaddressed medical needs.",

    "level": "severe",
    "justification": "The substantiated violations involve the agency's failure to monitor and document a youth's serious medical decline, including significant weight loss, muscle weakness, pressure sores, and medication side effects. The worker was unaware of emergency room visits and wounds, and critical medical information was not updated in the youth's file or passport. This constitutes a 'Medical and mental health concern' involving missed medical care and unmet treatment needs, falling under the 'severe' category."
