The\ndocumentation shall be completed not more\nthan 30 days prior to the start of employment\nand every 12 months thereafter.\nTwo of eight new employee files did not have central registry background\nchecks completed as required. One new employee file did not have a central\nregistry check completed on all previous last names. One new employee's\ncentral registry check was completed on 6/7/22, which was over 30 days prior\nto her hire date of 7/27/22.\nRepeat Violation Established\n2022 Renewal, CAP approved 5/4/2022\n2 021 Interim, CAP approved 3/31/2021\nCCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise\noutside of the direct supervision of staff, staff\nshall perform variable interval, eye-on checks\nof residents. The time between variable\ninterval checks shall not exceed 15 minutes.\nRoom checks were not completed at variable intervals. Room check logs had\nstandard 15-minute timeframes typed into the document so staff were not\nd ocumenting the times they completed the room checks.\n3",
    "CCI Rule 400.4506 Fire drills and telephone\n(1) There should be quarterly emergency fire\ndrills for each staff shift. Two of the drills shall\ninclude evacuations, unless approved by the\ndepartment, in writing, as clinically\ncontraindicated. Where a facility has a 24-hour\nstaff shift, the emergency drills shall be\nconducted at different times of the day and\nnight. Written records shall be maintained for\neach drill indicating the date and time of the\ndrill and, where evacuation was part of the\ndrill, the approximate evacuation time.\nFire drills were conducted quarterly but did not include each staff shift as it has\nbeen over a year since a fire drill was completed on third shift.\nCCI Rule 400.4167 Case record maintenance\n(1) The institution shall maintain a case record\nfor each resident.\nYouth files were not maintained. Two of eight closed youth files reviewed did\nnot contain discharge reports for the youth. One youth's case closed 8/8/22\nand another youth's case closed 10/28/22. These reports were printed on the\nday of the audit, signed, and back dated. One of the reports had a note stating\nthe case manager was no longer with the agency and could not sign. One of\nthree open youth files did not contain a service plan completed every 15\ncalendar days after the first 30 calendar days. The 45-day after admission\nreport for one youth was due by 9/27/22 and was not in the file.\nACT 116 722.120 Investigation, inspection, and examination of\nconditions, books, records, and reports; access\nby department, bureau of fire services, or local\nauthorities; records; reports report; forms;\nconfidentiality; disclosure of information;\navailability of confidential records; child\ninformation cards to be provided to department;\nfailure of licensee to cooperation with\ninvestigation, inspection or examination.;\n(1) The department may investigate, inspect, and\nexamine conditions of a childcare\norganization and may investigate and examine\nthe books and records of the licensee.

    "(c) Providing accurate and truthful information\nto the department, and encouraging\nwitnesses, such as staff and household\nmembers, to provide accurate and truthful\ninformation to the department.\nThere were youth reports printed on the day of the audit, signed, and back\ndated. A couple of the reports had a note stating the case manager was no\nlonger with the agency and could not sign.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Case files need to be kept up to date, and documents should not be printed on\nthe day of the audit to satisfy the licensing requirements.\n• Case files need to include signed reports by the case manager and case\nmanager supervisor. A few of the files reviewed had reports signed by the case\nmanager supervisor but there was a note the case manager was no longer\nworking there and could not sign. The agency admitted those reports were\nprinted the day of the audit, backdated, and put into the file.\n• One open youth file did not contain a dental exam completed within 12 months\nprior or 90 days after admission. The youth's dental exam was completed\n12/15/22 & his admission date was 8/11/22. However, the agency provided\ndocumentation the youth received a dental exam within 12 months prior the day\nafter the on-site inspection. The agency needs to make sure medical and dental\nexam documentation for 12 months prior to admission follows the youth's file to\neach CCI within Bethany Christian Services.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was not offered any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP was in response to nine\nviolations received during their 2022 Renewal Inspection. They have implemented\nthe CAP, and were able to resolve issues surrounding employee files containing\nwork history, job descriptions, education, references, TB testing and evaluations\nwithin 180 days. Unfortunately, the facility was not able to fully resolve issues\n5",
    "surrounding criminal history checks for employees, central registry checks for\nemployees and youth files containing discharge reports as those are all violations\nfound during this Interim Audit period.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on a review of the facility’s budget\nand the agency’s financial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported most of the violations from the 2022 renewal\naudit were a result of allowing federal employees to work in the facility due to low-\nstaffing levels at Bridgeway. During the last period, the facility was experiencing\nmany behavioral challenges with youth as well as language barriers due to a lack of\ninterpreters. CA reported during the 2022 audit period of review, they received a\nviolation surrounding missing discharge reports from youth files due to staffing\nchallenges within the case management team and miscommunications between\nquality assurance personnel. CA reported the error was eventually caught and\ncorrected, however there were obviously still some discharge reports missed, which\ncaused a violation during this period of review as well. CA reported the\ndiscontinued acceptance of federal volunteer workers in the program had a\nsignificantly positive impact on rule compliance. CA reported they hold an \"Annual\nDay\" which is a system wherein all staff members complete annual paperwork and\nbackground checks, which has been largely successful in helping the program\nremain in compliance with employee files for staff employed for longer than one\nyear. In addition, the facility has utilized a spreadsheet to track paperwork and\nannual checks for all current employees, which has reportedly been helpful for the\nfacility given the size of Bridgeway's team. CA reported there were no unplanned\ndischarges during the reporting period. CA stated bi-weekly team meetings and\nmonthly direct care staff meetings will continue to occur throughout the year. During\nthe meetings, staff review policies and procedures, receive specialized training on\ndifferent topics related to working with the residents, make enhancements to\nBridgeway programming and ensure high quality service provision at all levels.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nEmployees interviewed reported they all felt very supported by other staff,\nsupervisors, and upper management at the facility. One employee reported they\nare working on concerns with team dynamics as some team members are very\nstructured and others are very therapeutic, so they're trying to bridge the gap\nbetween the two work styles. The employee reported there is a staff member who\ntook a 6–8-month journey away from the facility and learned about communication,\ncommunication styles, etc. and is helping to be the neutral party to assist in these\nimprovements. Employees reported they are happy working at the facility, and they\nfeel there hasn't been a lot of staff turnover recently because it's such a great\n6",
    "environment to work in. Employees reported having two supervisors, two assistant\nsupervisors as well as staff who are willing to jump in and help whenever there are\ncrisis or stressful situations. Employees reported supervisors make time whenever\nneeded and they feel if/when they suggest changes or concerns, they feel they are\nheard. They also feel they are supported in having an appropriate home-work life\nbalance. Employees feel the communication regarding changes, information, safety\nneeds, etc. is adequate and they feel having consistent biweekly meetings has\nbeen very helpful. The only concern from employees was they wish the pay rate\ncould increase as the cost of living continues to increase.\nAll youth interviewed reported staff were nice and supportive. They reported they\nhad enough food at the facility and liked the food provided. They reported they felt\nsafe at the facility and felt all their needs were met. They reported they enjoyed\nstaying at the facility and did not have any concerns. They reported they didn't have\nany changes they would like to see occur.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of the facility occurred on April 4, 2023.\nThere were no issues or safety concerns noted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nApril 28, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 28, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
