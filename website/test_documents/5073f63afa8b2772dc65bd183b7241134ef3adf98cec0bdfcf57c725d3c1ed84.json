The agency was cited for 2\nviolations. Rule 400.12605 (1) and 722-08D. There were no repeat violations\nduring this reporting period.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) was discussed on site 4/29/2025 with\nthe Chief Administrator (CA). The (CA) reported it has been a challenge to\nmaintain compliance with the adoption rules and completing the adoption\nevaluation within 90 days. She reported outstanding documentation makes it\ndifficult especially when dealing with relatives. She said this process is also\ndifficult when dealing with the courts and Michigan Children’s Institute (MCI)\nwanting the agency to give caregivers additional time and not understanding why\nthe agencies try to deny due to the CPA rules of having the assessment\ncompleted in 90 days. The CA reported that the adoption supervisor resigned\nfrom the agency during this review period; however, one of the adoption staff was\npromoted to the supervisor position. She reported that the new supervisor has\nplenty of experience and is familiar with the CAP and has been able to support her\nstaff with remaining in compliance with the CAP.\nFinancial Overview:\nThe agency certified independent auditor’s report dated September 30, 2024, and\n2023 and the agency annual financial budget was reviewed. There were no\nfinancial concerns identified.\nStaff Interviews:\nThree staff members were interviewed on site 4/29/2025. The staff members\nwere all consistent in stating they are supported by their administration,\nsupervisors and coworkers. The staff members reported they love working for the\nagency because the culture and environment is a really good place to work. They\nare provided with the training they need to perform their jobs, and all departments\nget along with one another. The only change they would make is the mileage rate.\nOverall, the staff enjoy what they do and love working with families and keeping\nchildren safe.",

Physical CHRI and case files are all stored\nsecurely, preventing unauthorized access. No concerns were noted.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n5/22/2025\n______________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n5/22/2025\n______________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
