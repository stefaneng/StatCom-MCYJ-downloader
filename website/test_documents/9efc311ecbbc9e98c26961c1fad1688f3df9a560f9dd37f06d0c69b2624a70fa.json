Youth A put phone in their underwear and staff retrieved it.\nA youth’s arm was twisted by an LIRS staff member.\nINVESTIGATION:\nIncident One:\nA complaint was received on 2/22/22 that stated Youth A had a cell phone. Program\nDirector (PD) went to collect the phone from Youth A, but Youth A would not give it\nback. PD tried to take Youth A down to the ground to get his phone. Youth A was\nresisting the take down. PD then pulled Youth A’s shirt off. Youth A was made to\nstrip to his underwear. Youth A then put the phone in his underwear. PD reached\ninto Youth A’s underwear and took the phone. Youth A then ran away.\nInterviews:\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 2/22/22 via telephone and face to face at the facility on\n3/7/22 along with the DHHS Worker. He stated the information he received about\nYouth A was not witnessed by him but was put in a grievance form by Youth B. It\nwas reported Youth B, Youth C, and Youth D all witnessed the incident. The incident\nwas brought up in a meeting the facility had with the youth about the use of cell\nphones. The meeting happened approximately 1-2 weeks ago. The youth reported\nthe same information indicated in the complaint. A grievance was filled out after the\nother youth confirmed it happened. This was the first time Staff 1 heard of the\n5",
    "incident. Staff 1 stated all the staff are concerned about PD. The youth do not feel\ncomfortable around him.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via 3-way telephone call with the DHHS Worker on 3/4/22.\nShe stated she is a social work assistant. She was told to show all the youth their\npersonal belongings. She showed Youth A his belongings despite not wanting to\nbecause of Youth A's behaviors. When she showed him his items Youth A grabbed\nhis cell phone without her knowing. Another youth told Staff 5 that Youth A had his\ncell phone. She confronted Youth A in the living room of the house. Interpreter 3\nhelped her talk to Youth A. Youth A went into his bedroom and Staff 5 followed.\nWhen she got to his bedroom, Youth A had lifted his shirt up and said not to touch\nhim. Youth A grabbed the cell phone out of his cupboard and said if she got PD then\nhe would hand it over. Staff 5 got PD.

Youth A then tried to crawl under\nhis bed. PD grabbed Youth A's arm to keep him from going under the bed. When PD\nwent to grab Youth A, he had one knee on the floor with his other foot flat on the\nfloor and his hand holding Youth A's arm. PD was not over the top of Youth A but\nrather off to the side. PD was not forcing Youth A to the ground and did not place\nany pressure on his body. When Youth A went to the floor he was in a crawling\nposition. PD was not hurting Youth A, he just held him to prevent Youth A from going\nunder the bed. She did not see any injuries on Youth A. The other youth appeared\nand began watching. They were redirected to leave the area, but Youth C and Youth\nD went into the bedroom and hit PD. Youth A then ran outside without shoes or a\nshirt on. Youth A still had his cell phone in his pants. After he went outside, she got\nYouth A shoes and a coat because it was cold out and Youth A was not trying to\nrunaway. She and PD were focused on getting Youth A inside rather than the cell\nphone. They were outside for 10-20 minutes, then Youth A went inside. They did not\nget the cell phone from Youth A until the following day. Staff 5 thought Youth A took\nhis shirt off because he was preparing for a fight.

    "hand, twisting a youth’s arm, or wrapping arms around a youth to bear hug\nhim as their restraint techniques.\nIncident Two:\nA youth’s arm was twisted by an LIRS staff member.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring Staff 1’s interview on 2/22/22 he reported at night there was a riot and when\nhe pulled up to the facility, the police were there. The youth broke into the case\nmanagers office and took their belongings. The staff were then directed to search\nthe youth’s bedrooms. During the search, Youth D put his hand through a window\nand the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services (LIRS) staff grabbed his arm\nand twisted it until he agreed to go upstairs. Youth D was not harming himself or\nothers at the time. During a second interview with Staff 1 on 3/7/22, conducted with\nthe DHHS Worker, he changed his story regarding the incident on 2/21/22. He\nreported the LIRS staff was close to Youth D when he was picking up glass pieces\nfrom a broken window. She stood in front of Youth D to keep him from getting at the\nbroken window. The LIRS staff held Youth D's hand as he handed her the glass he\nhad in his hand, and she took it from him. This was the only touch he saw between\nthe LIRS staff and Youth D.\nYouth D was interviewed face to face at his school, along with the DHHS Worker, on\n2/24/22. Youth D stated when he and his peers wanted to go downstairs to get their\ncell phones there was a window in a door that was broken. Youth D put his arm\nthrough the window and the LIRS staff jokingly twisted his arm. He knew she was\njoking because she had a smile on her face, and she was not wearing a mask. He\nsaid his entire hand was twisted, but it was not painful. The LIRS staff did not say\nanything. He did not have any injuries. He was searching for his cell phone and\njoking around with the LIRS staff telling her to let him go.\nPD stated during his interview he was not present for the incident on 2/21/22. The\nLIRS staff did talk to him. He was called by the staff and told them to call the police.\nHe called the LIRS staff and told her what was going on and asked what he should\ndo. She told PD she would go to the facility instead of him. PD stated he did not\nthink the LIRS staff would be allowed to restrain the youth. She came to the facility\nas an administrator, so she did not need the training. The LIRS staff did not indicate\nto him she needed to restrain anyone.\nDHHS Case Conference was attended on 03/22/22 and they had no findings.\nIncident Three:\nInterviews:\nOn 2/22/22 Staff 1 reported Youth E was self-harming and attacked Program\nDirector (PD). Two interpreters had to restrain Youth E. Only Samaritas staff can\nrestrain the youth. Samaritas Staff stood by and watched Youth E harm himself\n9",
    "without intervening. PD ran out of the house. Staff 1 was not present when this\noccurred but was told by Federal Employee 2 and did not know what staff or federal\nemployees were present.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via three-way telephone call along with the DHHS Worker on\n3/3/22. Staff 6 is a therapist who usually works for another program within Samaritas\nbut has been helping at the shelter. Staff 6 reported there are a lot of people at the\nshelter but very few of them are actually trained to perform restraints. Staff 6 was\npresent for the incident with Youth E. Early in the day Youth E had run away and\nthen returned. He was barricading himself in his bedroom and smashed a phone.\nShe picked up the pieces of the phone and was in the hallway when she saw Youth\nE peak out the door and observed his arm bleeding. Staff 6 got an interpreter and\nthen saw there was a broken razor on the floor. Youth E left his bedroom and began\nto kick the office door requesting to talk to PD. Youth E banged his head into the\nwall. Staff 6 was trying to get people to help her. Someone, she did not recall who,\ncame to help and walked Youth E to the couch. Staff 6 began to clean Youth E’s\nwounds. PD then came out of the office and Youth E threw a chair at him. Staff 6\ntold PD to leave. Youth E calmed down and they were able to finish cleaning his\narm. An ambulance came and transported Youth E to the hospital. Staff 6 could not\nrecall who helped her with Youth E, but it could have been an interpreter She had to\nyell to get someone to help her. She reported it is the Samaritas staff's responsibility\nto address youth behaviors not the interpreters or the federal employees. She could\nnot recall if another Samaritas staff was present. Samaritas was having a shortage\nof staff (This is addressed in special investigation 2022C0103005). Youth E\nattempted to cut his arms again as staff were unable to get the razor from him. Staff\n6 and the interpreters held Youth E so the blade could be pried out of his hand. This\nwas not a typical hold as Youth E is much taller than Staff 6. She had her arm locked\nin with his and they were both being dragged around by the interpreters who were\nholding Youth E. Staff 6 reported that nothing they did was overly aggressive. Youth\nE was being held in a bear hug by Staff 6 and the interpreter. Staff 6 admitted she\nheld Youth E in a half bear hug herself. There were two interpreters, although she\ncould not recall their names, who pried the razor out of his hand.\nYouth E was interviewed face to face at his school along with the DHHS Worker. He\nstated he did hurt himself. He did this because PD was not listening to him or\nkeeping his promises. Youth E was worried about his family and their financial state\nat home. He cut himself with scissors while in his bedroom. He only did this the one\ntime. He showed his arms which were observed to have new scabs and old scars.\nPD was trying to get into his bedroom. PD promised he would do something about\nhis family's finances. He opened the door and went to PD. He hit his head against\nthe wall 3 times. He then got dizzy, and the police came. No one helped him but\nInterpreter 1 and Interpreter 2 who were trying to communicate with him. One of\nthem told him to sit on the couch. He denied that anyone held onto him. PD came\nout and stood in front of him. He became upset again and stood up. PD ran to his\noffice. Youth E sat for about an hour then he was taken to the doctor in an\n10",
    "ambulance. Interpreter 1 and Therapist went with him. That night the staff removed\nthe scissors from his bedroom and staff supervised him.\nInterpreter 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/10/22 along with the\nDHHS Worker. He was in House 2 when a federal employee asked for help because\nYouth E was cutting himself. When he entered House 1, he saw Youth E punching\nPD's office door. Youth E then began to hit his head on the wall. Staff 6 held Youth E\nwho also had a blade in his hand. She asked for help, so Interpreter 2 took Youth E\nand walked him to the couch with his arms wrapped around Youth E. Youth E still\nhad the blade in his hand. Youth E started to cut himself. Interpreter 2 was holding\nYouth E and Interpreter 1 was standing in front of Youth E. Youth E grabbed a chair\nto throw. Interpreter 2 helped Youth E to the couch again by wrapping his arms\naround him. Interpreter 1 took a towel and wrapped it around Youth E's arm. Each\ntime Interpreter 2 held Youth E it was for Youth E's safety and the safety of those\naround him.\nInterpreter 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/10/22 along with the\nDHHS Worker. He was in House 2 when Youth E cut himself. Someone called for\nhelp. He went to House 1 and Youth E had a razor blade and was punching and\nkicking the wall. When Youth E hit the wall with his head, he stumbled backwards so\nInterpreter 2 helped Youth E to the couch. Youth E still had the razor blade and was\ncutting his arms. No staff were intervening to stop Youth E, so Interpreter 2 stepped\nin and grabbed Youth E's hand to take the razor blade. A Samaritas staff, he did not\nknow which one, brought bandages to clean the blood and then the police arrived.\nInterpreter 2 said he was not the only person holding Youth E when he was on the\ncouch. There were 2-3 others holding Youth E, but he did not know who they were\nHe reported if the Samaritas staff present would have done their job then he would\nnot have had to step in. He did not know the names of the Samaritas staff who were\npresent.\nInterpreter 3 was present for the incident with Youth E on 2/17/22. He thinks Staff 6\nwas also present. Youth E barricaded himself in his bedroom and Staff 6 was able to\nget in by pushing the door. Youth E had at least 20 cuts on his arm. Staff 6 asked for\nthe blade, but he would not give it up. Youth E then left his bedroom and went to the\noffice door. Youth E began to hit his head on the wall next to the office door. He\nalmost went unconscious. Staff 6 and some other youth helped Youth E walk to the\ncouch. He still had the blade in his hand and cut himself again, approximately 10\ntimes. Interpreter 2 held Youth E from behind while he was standing, and Youth E\nwas sitting. Interpreter 3 then got the blade out of Youth E's hand. PD came to get\nthe blade and Youth E tried to throw chairs at PD. Interpreter 1, Interpreter 2, and\nInterpreter 3 held the chairs so he could not throw them. PD was asked to leave. PD\nwas not seen for the rest of the day. Someone called 911 and Youth E was taken to\nthe Emergency Room. Interpreter 3 stated there were only female Samaritas staff\nworking, and they could not manage the situation. Federal Employee 1 was also\nthere helping hold Youth E.\n11",
    "During her interview on 3/9/22 Therapist stated she was not present for the incident\nwith Youth E but came in to take him to the hospital. She reported PD was a trigger\nfor Youth E.\nFederal Employee 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility along with the DHHS\nWorker on 3/9/22. He remembered the incident with Youth E. He was there but he\ndid not engage with Youth E. He saw the blood on Youth E and did not want to get\nnear him. Youth E was anxious and angry at PD. Youth E had also hit his head on\nthe wall. He then laid down on the couch. Federal Employee 1 stated another youth\nhelped clean Youth E's wounds but did not know who. He was going to help but was\ntold Youth E still had the blade, so he did not go near him. One of the interpreters,\nhe could not recall which one, took the razor blade from Youth E. He never saw how\nthe blade was removed from Youth E. He said a Samaritas staff was also helping\nbut he did not recall who it was. An ambulance came and took Youth E to the\nhospital.\nPD was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/22 along with the DHHS\nWorker. He reported Youth E threatened PD. PD did not touch Youth E. PD tried to\ntalk to Youth E, but Youth E raised his fist at PD. PD backed up which allowed Youth\nE to close his door more and barricade himself in his bedroom. He smashed the cell\nphone he had and threw the pieces out his bedroom door. PD had a meeting he\nneeded to attend and told the staff to keep an eye on Youth E. The next thing PD\nknew Youth E was banging on PD's office door trying to get to PD. PD did not know\nwhy Youth E was upset with him. There were several Samaritas staff, federal staff,\nand interpreters, the PD did not know specifically which ones, who were with Youth\nE. PD stated if he came out of his office it would have just escalated Youth E further.\nYouth E had fallen backwards after hitting his head and Staff 6 held onto him. PD\ncame out of the office and Staff 6 was helping Youth E to the couch. He had a staff\nmember call 911. While Youth E was on the couch, PD was able to get the blade\nfrom Youth E and throw it away in the office. An interpreter tried to get the blade\nfrom Youth E as well, but he could not remember which interpreter. He tried to help\nget Youth E cleaned up, but when Youth E realized it was PD, he swung at PD. PD\nthen left the building. Staff 6 was present for the incident as well as three case\nmanagers and federal employees, he did not indicate which ones. PD reported he\nleft as there were plenty of staff present and Staff 6 was pushing for PD to leave.\nPD stated the interpreters are not allowed to restrain youth as they did not receive\nrestraint training. The first time the interpreters put their hands on Youth E was when\nthey helped him to the couch. The second time was when Youth E was on the couch\nwith the blade. PD stated that several of the youth have it out for him. If PD were to\nrestrain Youth E the other youth would get involved. He reported the other Samaritas\nstaff that were working should have intervened with Youth E, but he did not\nremember what specific staff were present. PD reported staff are not supposed to be\nin the house if they are not trained on how to restrain a youth. PD did not know what\nstaff were scheduled to work direct care as he reported he does not complete the\nstaff schedule.\n12",
    "Video Reviewed:\nIn review of the video of the incident with Youth E, Youth E is observed banging his\nhead on the wall. Interpreter 2, Interpreter 3 and Staff 6 help walk Youth E to the\ncouch by wrapping their arms around him. Youth E tries to pull away from them on\nthe way to the couch, but they manage to sit him down. Youth E begins to cut his\narm. Interpreter 1, Interpreter 2, Interpreter 3, and Staff 6 try to stop him by holding\nhis arms. When PD enters the scene, Youth E gets up and tries to pick up a chair.\nInterpreter 1, Interpreter 2, and Interpreter 3 hold the chairs and PD leaves.\nIncident Four:\nInterviews:\nThe Volunteer Coordinator (VC) was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/24/22 along with the DHHS Worker. She coordinates the federal employees. The\nVC does not oversee the interpreters. The federal employees work twelve-hour\nshifts and there is one federal employee in each house at a time. Federal employees\nare to provide line of sight supervision of the youth. They can assist with meals, take\nyouth for walks, and do activities. They are not allowed to perform physical\nmanagements.\nTherapist reported since the youth met with Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)\non 3/9/22 things have been very difficult. Prior to the meeting Youth A has had\nissues since 2/16/22 with ORR Field Specialist. ORR Field Specialist, who speaks\ntheir language, called Youth A's father to report his behavior and this triggered Youth\nA' s behavior. ORR Field Specialist wanted to meet with the youth and PD told him\nnot to meet with the youth at school so there could be better support when he talked\nto the youth. ORR Field Specialist met with the youth at their school anyways. The\nyouth did not respond well and rioted at the school. Youth A tried to harm himself by\njumping from the 4th floor balcony. Therapist and Federal Employee 1 held Youth A\nback from jumping by wrapping their arms around his torso. The other youth from\nthe facility that were present also helped hold Youth A back, but she could not recall\nwho those youth were. They were able to pull him down. Therapist said she has had\nrestraint training. Even though this was not an actual restraint technique it was still a\nrestraint. She knows she did not perform the appropriate restraint technique, but she\nreported they did not have any other alternative. PD was informed of the incident.\nDuring Federal Employee 1’s interview he reported while at the school he held Youth\nA when Youth A tried to jump. Youth A was upset with ORR Field Specialist. Federal\nEmployee 1 wrapped his arms around Youth A in a bear hug. One of his peers also\ntried to stop Youth A. Federal Employee 1 did not know what the youth’s name was.\n13",

These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their families,\nand referring agencies.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: Incident 1: Witnesses indicated PD pulled on Youth A’s arm\nrestricting his movement to keep him from going under the bed.\nHe was also observed on video restricting the movement of\nanother youth. The techniques utilized by PD were not Aegis\napproved techniques. PD, Staff 5, and Interpreter 3 all indicated\nPD did not reach into Youth A’s underwear to grab the cell\nphone, nor did he make Youth A strip, or take Youth A to the\nground to get the cell phone.\nIncident 2: There is not enough information to indicate the LIRS\nstaff twisted the youth’s arm as Staff 1 accounts of the incident\nchanged, the LIRS staff denied she twisted Youth D’s arm, and\nYouth D said LIRS staff twisted his arm in a joking manner.\nIncident 3: The interpreters reported they had to hold Youth E to\nkeep himself and others safe. The interpreters are not\nSamaritas staff and should not be restraining the youth.\nBecause the interpreters are not trained in restraints, the holds\nthey did were not Aegis approved techniques. Per facility policy\nonly Aegis approved restraints can be performed and only Aegis\ntrained staff can perform the restraints.\nIncident 4: Therapist and Federal Employee 1 both indicated\nthey had to restrain Youth A to keep him from hurting himself.\nFederal Employee 1 is not trained to do restraints and Therapist\nindicated the hold was not an Aegis hold. Per facility policy only\nAegis approved restraints can be performed and only Aegis\ntrained staff can perform the restraints.\nNone of the restraints discovered during this investigation were\nentered into MiSACWIS as required by the facility’s policy.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n14",
    "ALLEGATION:\nThe Youth are not provided with adequate dental, medical, or mental health\nservices.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews:\nDuring his interview on 2/22/22 Staff 1 reported the Program Director (PD) will not\nschedule dental appointments for the youth when they are in pain. PD also does not\ngive the youth medication such as pain medication when they ask for it. Staff miss\ngiving youth their medication.\nStaff 1 was again interviewed on 3/7/22 face to face at the facility along with the\nDHHS Worker. He has had several concerns with the facility but the main one is the\nunder reporting of suicidal ideation. About half of the youth at the facility have mental\nhealth issues. Staff 1 reported concerns that the psychiatrist does not see the youth\nin person, the psychiatrist puts the youth on medication, and then will abruptly take\nthem off. Staff 1 was told this was the only psychiatrist that would take the youth’s\ninsurance. He told PD and Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) that the youth\nneed more mental health support. He told them this prior to Youth E harming\nhimself. He talked to PD about his concerns. PD stated they were limited on what\nthey could do because of the youth’s insurance. Staff 1 said he checked with ORR,\nand they told him they pay for the medical, dental, and mental health treatment for\nthe youth. Some of the youth have tooth infections that they had when they were\nadmitted to the facility. He talked to the medical coordinator about it, and she\nindicated it was an insurance issue. After he brought it up one of the youths was put\non an antibiotic. He overheard a staff asking PD about a youth’s medication. The\nyouth did not receive his scheduled antibiotic so PD said he could take two at a time.\nStaff 1 reported staff are not logging medication correctly.\nDuring Youth D’s interview on 2/24/22 he stated he has medication to help him sleep\nbut it does not help so he is not taking it. Youth D did go to the dentist, but they did\nnot fix the problem. He has a black tooth and a cavity. Youth D meets with his\ntherapist at school, but he does not know her name. Youth D tried to cut himself, but\nhe was not serious. He saw a doctor about his sleep but never talked to him about\nhurting himself.\nYouth E said during his interview on 2/24/22 that he did go to the dentist for a\ncleaning, but he has cavities that hurt.\nDuring PD’s interview on 3/7/22 he reported there is a medical coordinator he\nsupervises. She is responsible to schedule the dental appointments. The youth had\ndental appointments but many of them have extensive problems and they need to\nschedule additional appointments. Those appointments are harder to schedule.\nWhen the youth complain of pain, Samaritas will take them to urgent care. They\n15",
    "must receive prior approval from the insurance company before any appointments\nand then they have to ask 2-3 times for approval before it gets approved. The facility\nhas a partnership with a psychiatrist who meets with the youth virtually and\nprescribes medication. The psychiatrist was sent to them from ORR. The youth\nrefuse to take the medication often; seeing it as a sign of weakness or that\nSamaritas is trying to drug them. Samaritas staff are responsible for passing\nmedication. PD stated he has never refused to provide medication to any youth.\nStaff 5 reported during her interview on 3/4/22 that she believes the youths mental\nhealth is being taken care of as best they can. The youth do not believe in mental\nhealth, so they often refuse services. Some of the youths have had a psychiatric\nevaluation with the doctor as well as follow-ups.\nOn 3/3/22 Staff 6 stated the doctor the youth see is a psychiatrist. A couple of the\nyouth are prescribed psychotropic medications, but they often refuse to take them.\nSome of the youth went to the dentist recently. She knows some of the youths have\nalso gone to urgent care. She believes they are offering all the mental health\nservices they can provide but they are a transitional placement, so their services are\nlimited. She believes they need more well-trained staff and a set routine for the\nyouth.\nMedical Coordinator (MC) was interviewed via telephone on 4/6/22. She reported all\nthe youth had physicals completed prior to admission but ORR requested new\nphysicals be completed, so all the youth received physicals. MC got the youth\nstarted with a dentist, but the dentist stopped seeing the youth. MC had to find a new\ndentist. It was difficult to find a dentist who would work with the youth’s insurance. A\nnew dental provider was found, but Samaritas did not like working with the provider\nbecause they would not provide after visit summaries. She reported Youth J needed\na lot of dental work but due to an infected tooth he needed to be on an antibiotic for\n10 days. Youth J refused to comply with the antibiotic, so it took him longer to finish\nit. Youth J and other youth were in the process of getting their dental work\nappointments scheduled when they left Samaritas.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Youth Case files: All youth case files were reviewed.

She reported she was the only\nSamaritas staff present, along with Interpreter 4. When she pulled over the van the\n19",
    "youth got out and Interpreter 4 followed the youth. When asked, she reported Youth\nA was in her van and he did not have a one-on-one staff. She had House 1 in her\nvan and the other van had youth from House 2, Staff 11 and Staff 12.\nOn 3/14/22 Program Manager (PM) was questioned about Staff 2 being the only\nSamaritas staff in the van the night of 3/5/22. He reported Youth G was left at the\nhouse without any Samaritas staff during the outing. He made arrangements for\nStaff 10 to stay with him but when she got to the house, Staff 10 did not see Youth G\nand she left. PM stated Staff 10 did not check both houses prior to leaving. She\nthought the youth went with the rest of the group. When PM discovered what had\nhappened, he sent a staff back to the house. He thought he sent Staff 3 back. By\nthen Youth G had run away from the facility. Youth G returned before the staff could\ncall the police.\nStaff 10 was interviewed by telephone on 4/7/22.

    "Incident Three:\nInterviews:\nStaff 1 reported during his interview on 3/7/22 Youth E made comments about self-\nharm in early February before he cut himself with a razor.\nOn 3/7/22 PD reported Youth E entered the facility with the razor. Because the youth\nwere all admitted at once, they did not have the staff to search all their belongings.\nHe further stated they must provide razors for the youth due to religious reasons. He\noffered electric razors, but they did not like that. The staff are supposed to get the\nrazor back from the youth after youth are done using it.\nStaff 6 stated in her interview on 3/3/22 Youth E should not have been allowed to\nhave a razor.\nYouth E was interviewed face to face at his school on 2/24/22 along with the DHHS\nWorker.

Additionally, youth should not dictate to staff what they will\nuse and not use. If staff determine an electric razor is safest,\nthen they have complied with meeting the youths’ needs and it is\nthen the youth’s decision to use it or not.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDING:\nThe youth in the program have needs that are outside the scope of the program.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews:\nDuring Program Director’s (PD) interview on 3/7/22 he stated they were set up to fail\nby Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) because they were not equipped to take\nnineteen Afghan youth in one day. They did not have the staffing. The youth’s\nbehaviors and mental health needs were outside the scope of their program. They\nhave different needs and were of a different culture than what Samaritas staff have\nworked with in the past, and are knowledgeable about.\nPhone conversations occurred with the Chief Administrator on 2/18/22, 2/24/22,\n3/9/22, 3/10/22, and 3/16/22. She indicated Samaritas was not equipped to take the\nyouth that ORR placed at Samaritas. They communicated this with ORR from the\nbeginning but since Samaritas is subcontracted with LIRS through ORR, ORR pays\nfor the Samaritas beds, they are required to take placement of the youth.\n22",
    "On 3/14/22 I reviewed a video dated 2/17/22 in which several Samaritas staff were\nnot intervening when a youth was self-harming. A video from 2/21/22 showed staff\nstanding around not engaging with the youth while the youths broke into the locked\nbasement. After reviewing these videos of staff standing around and not engaging\nyouth during two different crisis situations PM stated the staff were afraid of the\nyouth.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Program Statement: Youth accepted to the program must demonstrate the\nability to manage their behavior. The youth may have mild behavioral and\nmental health issues, but the program is not designed for high-risk youth,\nincluding youth who are physically or sexually aggressive or are not\nappropriate for a community-based setting.\n Significant Incident Reports: Youth A had an SIR indicating he wanted to\nharm himself and he had several SIRs indicating he assaulted other peers.\nYouth D and Youth F had SIRs in which they threatened to harm themselves.\nAlmost all the youth engaged in truancy from the program or from staff while\non outings. All the youth in House 1 engaged in property destruction by\nthrowing a chair through a window, hitting the TV causing it to break, and\nbreaking a window to gain access to the basement. All but one youth in\nHouse 1 had SIRs indicating they would hurt themselves or someone else if\nthey did not get what they wanted.\n Youth Case files: All 11 casefiles were reviewed. All the youth were admitted\nto the Shelter on 1/4/22. All but one youth had incidents of being verbally\nand/or physically aggressive toward both youth and staff. They also have\ndestroyed property, threatened self-harm, and ran away.\nVideo’s Reviewed:\n A video of an incident that occurred on 2/21/22 was reviewed that showed all\nthe youth from House 1 and some youth from House 2 breaking a window\nand entering the basement. Samaritas Staff did not engage with the youth to\nattempt to de-escalate the situation.\n A video of an incident that occurred on 2/17/22 was reviewed that showed a\nyouth banging his head into the wall several times causing him to stumble\nbackwards.
