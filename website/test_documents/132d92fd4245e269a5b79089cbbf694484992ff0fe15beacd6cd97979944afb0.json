He recalled the incident started while inside the\nfacility. Youth A recalled pushing Staff 1 while she was in the\nhallway. He stated the reason he pushed her was because she\nwas not allowing him to enter back into the unit. He believed she\nwas trying to slam his fingers in the door and recalled hearing\nSupervisor 3 instructing Staff 1 to leave him alone. After Youth A\npushed Staff 1, he recalled Youth B coming over to fight\nhim. Youth A stated this fight moved outside. Youth A recalled\nseeing Staff 1 outside, and he decided to punch her. Staff 1 then\nslapped Youth A with something in her hand, and Youth A could\nnot recall what this was. He believed it was a purse or a\nwallet. He was also not sure if she made contact but confirmed\nthat she swung at his face. Youth A recalled other staff being\naround but could not confirm who that was. Youth A believed the\noutside incident ended quickly because he AWOL’ed off the\nfacility grounds.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker\n1 on 04/28/2025. She recalled being called to the situation for a\ncrisis response. When she arrived the fight between Youth A and\nYouth B was outside.

She\nrecalled the incident in question beginning because she was\nattempting to prevent Youth A from AWOL’ing. She was\n4",
    "concerned Youth A would also attempt to get other youth to\nAWOL with him as that had occurred recently.
