She stated\nHoly Cross contacted her to discuss transfer of Youth A’s case\ndue to his age and court jurisdiction recently ending. The email\nwas sent from DHHS FC Supervisor 2 on September 7, 2023, and\nindicated Youth A turned 19 and based on policy the agency is not\nable to maintain the case and asked how they would like to\nproceed. On September 18, 2023, DHHS FC Supervisor 2\nindicated her office agreed Youth A was not ready to have his\ncase closed and asked if Youth A would be able to transition to\nYoung Adult Voluntary Foster Care (YAVFC).\nDHHS FC Supervisor 2 clarified their office did not at any point\nindicate they would be unwilling to accept the case transfer. A\ncase transfer meeting was held in November 2023 when it was\ndecided the case would transfer back to Department of Health and\nHuman Services (DHHS). Prior to transferring the case, the\nexpectation was the case would be up to date prior to case\ntransfer acceptance. The case file had two late service plans that\nneeded to be completed and DHHS FC Supervisor 2 requested\nmultiple times that face-to-face contact be made with Youth A to\nensure his safety and wellbeing since it was noticed that contact\nhad not been made with him in a few months and there were no\nsocial work contacts that indicated any attempts to verify wellbeing\nhad been made. She reminded the agency they are responsible\nfor case management responsibilities up until the case is\n2",
    "transferred. There was email correspondence between the two\nagencies for a few months while the case work was caught up.\nDHHS FC Supervisor 2 stated her office took the stance that it\nwould be appropriate to close Youth A’s case if they are unable to\nlocate him and he is not willing to engage in services. He could\ncome back and participate in YAVFC if he chooses to do so later.\nFoster Care Worker 1 (FCW1) was interviewed via telephone\non April 2, 2024. She stated she was Youth A’s assigned\ncaseworker until she left for maternity leave on October 13, 2023.\nShe returned from leave in January and was reassigned to Youth\nA’s case on February 22, 2024. Youth A contacted her on October\n25, 2023, while she was on leave and inquired who his\ncaseworker was. FCW1 contacted FCW2 and informed her Youth\nA had contacted her but neither one reached out to him. She\nstated there were no documented attempts in the case file.\nUpon her return she was advised face-to-face contact had not\nbeen made with Youth A since she left and to attempt face-to-face\ncontact with him. FCW1 was asked about Youth A’s level of\nparticipation, and she stated during the course of his independent\nliving placement he was not participating in work, school or any\nservices that would promote independence.\nFoster Care Worker 2 (FCW2) was interviewed via telephone\non April 2, 2024. She stated she reached out to the DHHS office\nthat oversees Youth A’s case prior to him turning 19 to advise of\nhis upcoming birthday at the beginning of September 2023 and of\nthe court hearing that was scheduled at the end of September\n2023. Upon receiving the court order that indicated court\njurisdiction had closed, FCW2 contacted the DHHS office again\nand it was agreed Holy Cross would complete some case\nmanagement items prior to transferring the case to DHHS.\nA case transfer conference was held in December 2023. FCW2\nstated DHHS did not at any point refuse to accept case transfer\nhowever, during the meeting DHHS insisted the case service\nplans were current and requested Holy Cross make face-to-face\ncontact with Youth A to verify his wellbeing prior to accepting case\ntransfer. FCW2 stated multiple attempts were made to contact\nYouth A but were unsuccessful. The attempts included\nunannounced visits, driving around the location Youth A resides,\nand mailing a letter to his PO Box. FCW1 returned from maternity\nleave at the end of February 2024 and was able to make face-to-\nface with Youth A.\n3",
    "During his independent living (IL) case, Youth A was not\nparticipating in work, school or any services. The agency hoped\nYouth A would be able to participate in YAVFC but due to his\nrefusal to participate in work, school and services he would not be\neligible.\nYouth A was interviewed via telephone on April 2, 2024. He\nstated FCW1 was on maternity leave from October 2023 through\nMarch 2024. During that timeframe his case was reassigned to\nsomeone else and no one from the agency ever reached out to\nhim. Youth A stated he had a government issued phone until the\nend of October and the agency could have contacted him via\nemail or through mail. Youth A clarified that FCW 1 had assisted\nhim with obtaining a PO Box prior to going on maternity leave. He\nstated he has been residing in the same location since prior to\nOctober and he is not aware of any attempts to complete a home\nvisit with him. Youth A stated he tried to locate a phone number\nfor someone at Holy Cross but was not able to find one. He was\nhopeful someone at the agency could assist him with some of the\nthings FCW1 had been working with him on prior to going on\nmaternity leave.\nPAFC Foster Care Supervisor 1 (FC Supervisor 1) was\ninterviewed via telephone on April 4, 2024.

At that point, DHHS\ninquired if Youth A was ready for closure and whether or not the\ncase was able to remain open. PAFC FC Supervisor 1 stated she\ninformed DHHS Youth A was not eligible for YAVFC due to not\nparticipating in any services, employment, or school. DHHS\nindicated Youth A’s case should remain open. PAFC FC\nSupervisor 1 stated there were discussions regarding whether or\nnot the agency could maintain case management and it was\ndetermined Private Agency Foster Care (PAFC) are not able to\nkeep cases when youth turn 19. She stated a case transfer was\nheld at the beginning of December 2023; however, it took over a\nmonth to schedule that.\nPAFC FC Supervisor 1 stated the agency was transparent about\nthe fact they had not made face-to-face contact with Youth A since\ncourt jurisdiction closed.
