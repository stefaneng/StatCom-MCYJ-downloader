FTMs\nserve as the primary forum for safety planning,\ncollaborative service planning, service identification, and\nassessing progress. The FTM represents a child-centered,\nfamily-driven, strength-based, team-guided approach,\ndesigned to engage families in developing plans for the\nsafety, permanency and well-being of their children and\nfamily….\nUpdated Case Plan (USP) - within 30 calendar days before the case plan\ndue date.\nPermanent Ward Service Plan (PWSP) - within 30 calendar days before\nthe case plan due date.\nThree of eleven open case files reviewed did not have the required FTM’s\nthroughout the duration of the case. This is a repeat violation cited in the 2019\nLicensing Inspection Report dated 8/21/19 for which a CAP was approved on\n9/3/20 and the 2018 Licensing Inspection Report dated 9/12/18 for which a CAP\nfor this violation was approved on 10/10/18\nFOM 722-06H Caseworker Contact\nCaseworker contact with children in out of home placement.\nSubsequent Months\nThe caseworker must have at least one face-to-face contact\nwith the child each calendar month.

Several signature pages or documentation of attempts to obtain\nsignatures had to be provided during the course of the inspection.\nSeveral documents were not uploaded at the time of initial review, rather had to be\nprovided only after being found to be missing. More regular internal case file reviews\nwould reduce the number of missing document and ensure complete files, as\nrequired.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require any consultation at the time of the review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\n7",

They\nindicate that, despite the challenges brought about by working from home and\nservice restrictions, they have maintained good communication with their peers,\nsupervisors, and the administration. They reported that this has helped them\nmaintain family services as well as rule/policy compliance during this period under\nreview.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nMISEP requirements or policy. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan,\nit is recommended that the facility continue on a regular license.\nOctober 8, 2020\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 8, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n8"
