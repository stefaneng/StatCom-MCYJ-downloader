    "Director of Quality and Compliance was interviewed face to\nface at the facility on July 5, 2023. Director of Quality and\nCompliance reported the incident report in MiSACWIS did not\ninclude the entire narrative from the Eagle Village incident report\ndescribing the incident with Youth A in its entirety. The narrative\nwas copied and pasted from the Eagle Village incident report but\nleft out the first two paragraphs describing Youth A’s behaviors\nleading up to the restraint.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Michigan Department of Health and Human Services\nIncident report 156900207 involving Youth A: Incident\nreport describes Youth A being placed in a restraint for\n“throwing things again and grabbing a spatula.”\n• Eagle Village Incident Report dated 6/17/2023 involving\nYouth A: Incident report describes Youth A threatening to\ncut his peers, grabbing a metal music stand smashing the\nTV, breaking windows, and cutting Staff 2’s hand with a\nspatula. This incident report is consistent with Youth A,\nYouth C, Staff 1, and Staff 2’s interviews.\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: There was one disciplinary record\nnot related to restraints and Staff 1 completed the required\nAegis training on 1/18/23.\n• Staff 2’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record\nand Staff 2 completed the required Aegis training on 2/8/23.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as the restraint was warranted\ndue to Youth A cutting Staff 2’s hand with a spatula. The incident\nreport I reviewed did not have the information describing the\nevents and Youth A’s behavior leading up to the restraint.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(d) Storage of medications.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The medication cart was unlocked and the door where the\nmedication is kept was unlocked. The staff office door was\nlocked.\nInvestigation I completed a walkthrough of Gerber House on July 5, 2023.\nUpon entering the medication office, the door was observed to be\nslightly opened, unlocked and the medication cart unlocked. The\n4",
    "staff office door leading to the medication room was locked.\nThere were no youth in the house at the time.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on July\n5, 2023. Supervisor stated it was “crazy” at the house when\nleaving that morning and locking the medication cart was\nforgotten. Supervisor showed me that he had the medication keys\nin his pocket. Supervisor stated the medication cart being\nunlocked would have been noticed when returning to the house or\nfor sure when the keys were passed to the next staff member.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Residential Services Standard Operating Procedures,\nResidential Storage of Medication: Policy states, “All\nmedication shall be stored in the locked medication cart.\nThis locked cart will be placed in a location within each\nresidence that is an area restricted to residents and that\nrequires entrance through one locked door.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as the medication cart was\nleft unlocked.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJuly 7, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nBarbara A Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 7, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5",
