Apple\nMuskegon, MI 49442\nRE: License #: CO610385814\nMuskegon County Juvenile Transition Center\n205 E. Apple\nMuskegon, MI 49442\nDear Ms. French:\nThis letter is a follow-up to the Department’s findings regarding the interim inspection\nconducted at your facility on 06/09/2022. The purpose of this inspection was to determine\ncompliance with applicable licensing statutes and administrative rules for Court Operated\nResidential Care Facility.\nYour facility was found to be in compliance with the requirements of Licensing Rules for\nJuvenile Court Operated Facilities.\nAn onsite tour was completed on 06/13/2022. The facility was observed to be clean and\nwell maintained. Ample staff were present and observed to be supervising the residents.\nThis consultant viewed all the pod areas where the youth are residing, and it was\nobserved to be clean and well maintained. Residents were attending their onsite\nschooling during the tour.\nDuring interviews staff reported feeling both staff and residents are safe at the facility and\nsupervision is provided as required. Staff expressed frustration with having a difficult\nyouth on the unit that has more mental health needs and not always knowing what will\ntrigger a youth to have escalated behaviors. During interviews with residents, they\nindicated they enjoy the food that is being provided at the facility and the staff treat them\nwith respect. Residents reported feeling safe at the facility. Residents noted they wanted\nto be able to listen to their own choice of music instead of just instrumental music. Staff\nreported the concerns that youth listen to inappropriate music that have swear words and\ntalk about violence. Both staff and residents interviewed stated residents are only\nrestrained after staff have attempted to verbally deescalate the situation first and is used",
    "as a last resort. Neither staff nor residents indicated concerns with restraints they\nobserved or participated in.\nTechnical assistance was provided to the administration team of making sure the staff\nhave role clarity as they expressed frustration on some new roles that have been\nimplemented on the unit. It was also discussed about helping staff understand the mental\nhealth needs of the youth and having clear communication about how to help support\nthose youth. This consultant discussed the increase in restraint numbers being solely due\nto one youth based on the high mental health needs and trauma the youth experienced.\nThe facility has maintained appropriate communication about the needs of this youth and\nwhat steps are being taken to make sure this youth is being transitioned into the next\nappropriate program. Consultation was provided about the treatment program, as it is not\ncurrently being used. The facility is looking at the potential options of changing the\ntreatment program to meet the community’s needs.\nPlease contact me with any questions. In the event that I am not available, and you need\nto speak to someone immediately, please contact the area manager, Jessica\nVandenHeuvel at (616) 204-6992.\nSincerely,\nCathrine Raftery, Licensing Consultant\nJune 13, 2022\nJessica VandenHeuvel, Area Manager\n2"
