    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nChange of the terms of the Boelkins program from male only to male and female.\nIII. Methodology\nOn 2/24/2021 I reviewed an updated program statement provided by the Chief\nAdministrator.\nOn 2/26/2021 I held a conference call with the Chief Administrator to discuss the\nproposed changes to the program including preparation of program staff for the\nchange, additional supervision concerns, and bedroom arrangements.\nOn 3/25/2021 I received and reviewed an application for the proposed change.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe Boelkins program has historically served male youth. Expanding the terms to\ninclude female youth would allow the program to accept additional placement\nreferrals. Wedgwood already has 2 co-ed programs on campus, so there is no\nneed to change the policies and procedures in place. The Boelkins home has two\nseparate hallways with youth bedrooms allowing for separation of genders. Each\nhallway has a single stall bathroom, which includes a shower. The bathrooms are\nlocked from the outside requiring staff to open the bathroom for youth’s use. The\nprogram has recently undergone staffing changes and there will be a new program\nsupervisor hired and all program staff will be trained regarding the change in the\nmilieu. There are no programming changes needed.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend that the terms of the Kentwood Campus license be changed to\ninclude female youth for the Boelkins program only.\nMarch 26, 2021\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved by:\nMarch 29, 2021\nClaudia Triestram\nArea Manager\n2"
