Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nOn Saturday 06/26/2021, Youth A had to be restrained after fighting with another\nchild at Kalamazoo County Juvenile Home.

He reported\nbeing made aware of the allegations by Supervisor 1 shortly after Supervisor 1\nreviewed the video recording of the incident on the same day as the incident. He\nalso reported observing the video recording and concluding Supervisor 1 did not use\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "the appropriate behavior management techniques. He reported speaking will the five\nother staff involved about the incident, and he also reported Supervisor 1 has not\nworked at the facility since the incident.\nI interviewed Youth A in person at the facility on 6/30/21. He reported being told\nby Supervisor 1 to go to his room and while he attempted to go to his room\n“Supervisor 1 grabbed me by my neck”. He also reported being choked by\nSupervisor 1 because “he squeezed a little bit”. He had no further information to\nprovide and ended when he reported feeling safe at the facility and never being\nabused by staff.\nI interviewed Staff 1 in person at the facility on 6/30/21. She reported being\npresent during the allegations and stated, “I witnessed Supervisor 1 grabbing\nYouth’s neck and forcing him into his room”. She reported staff “had the situation\nunder control and Youth A was going to his room at the time of Supervisor 1’s\nintervention. She also reported not believing Youth A was any type of threat to the\nstaff present or any other youth. She ended the interview when she reported telling\nSupervisor 1, he had “choked Youth A”.\nI interviewed Staff 2 in person at the facility on 6/30/21. He also reported being\npresent during the allegations and he stated, “when I got into the room, Youth A was\nacting out and refusing to go to his room”. He also reported Youth A was attempting\nto get to the other room to continue the fight with another youth that began the\nincident. He stated, “we were trying to calm Youth A down and he was no longer a\nthreat to us and not combative towards us”. Staff 2 continued, “Youth A stepped up\non a chair and at that point if felt like he needed to be restrained so I began the\nprocess. I put my arms around him and held him while beginning to walk towards his\nroom.” He reported Supervisor 1 “came out of nowhere and placed his hands near\nYouth A’s neck but his hands were near the neck area only a couple of seconds”. He\nreported Supervisor 1 did not use the trained method of behavior management.\nI interviewed Staff 3 in person at the facility on 6/30/21. He also reported being\npresent during the allegations and stated, “Youth A was not complying, but he was\nalso not putting up much of a struggle. We were inching him closer to his room.” He\nreported Supervisor 1 came into the situation and “told Youth A to go to his room but\nYouth A didn’t go to his room”. He also reported Supervisor 1 “reached over to grab\nYouth A and touched him in his neck area.” He reported Supervisor 1 never choked\nYouth A and “some staff may have thought Youth A was choked but Supervisor 1\nonly touched him on the neck”. He also reported the same as other staff that\nSupervisor 1 did not use an approved intervention technique with Youth A.\nI interviewed Staff 4 in person at the facility on 6/30/21. As with other staff\ninterviewed, Staff 4 reported being present during the allegations. He gave a similar\ndescription of the incident between Supervisor 1 and Youth A and reported\nSupervisor 1 had his hands on Youth A’s neck for “a few seconds”. He also reported\nif Supervisor 1 were choking Youth A he would not have been able to say, “get your\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "fucking hands off my neck”. He also reported Supervisor 1 was not using an\napproved technique during his intervention.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 in person at the facility on 6/30/21. He reported\nreceiving a “level one call around 10 o’clock in the morning” of the incident. He also\nreported Staff 1 called this report in and “sounded distressed” so he “got there\nquickly”. He reported getting to the location of the situation and finding Youth A\nfighting with another youth. He also reported helping with the other youth and having\nthe other staff escort Youth A to the other “pod”. He provided the following, “I looked\nup and saw Youth A beginning to move to his room but then stopped and took his\nsweater off. This is a sign a youth is getting ready to fight and then he pushed away\nfrom Staff 4 before breaking away from Staff 1 when she attempted to grab him\naround the waist.” He reported having a belief the staff engaged with Youth A were\nin danger because of his history and size. He also reported leaving the other youth\nwith another staff so he could help with Youth A in the other “pod”. He reported\ngoing into the other “pod” and the staff were silent and did not provide any\ninformation on the situation to him. He reported normally, the staff would tell him\nwhat was occurring. He reported observing Youth A step up on a chair and\nattempting to break away from Staff 2 before he intervened and “tried to support\nStaff 2 so he didn’t get hit or hurt”. He also reported Youth A was “hovering over me\nand I believed he would hit Staff 2 or myself, so my first thought was to push Youth\nA into Staff 2’s arms”. Supervisor 1 reported a belief this would allow Staff 2 to get a\nbetter hold on Youth A, so he “reached up but I reached up to high”. He reported he\nwas attempting to turn Youth A and when he “realized where my hands where I\ndropped my hands and let Staff 2 take full control”. He also reported pushing Youth\nA into his room in his effort to get Youth A into his room and “away from staff”.\nSupervisor 1 ended the interview when he reported not using the correct techniques\nduring the incident.\nOn 7/1/21 a phone message was left with Youth A’s probation officer but at the time\nof this report being written, no response has been received.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the Human Resources file for Supervisor 1. Documentation within the file\nindicates he has been employed at the facility for the past twenty-one years. Of this\ntime, he has been in the supervisor role for the past thirteen years. There is only one\ndocumented disciplinary action taken with Supervisor 1 and this occurred on May 6,\n2009. He was cited for dispensing the wrong prescription medication to a youth at\nthe facility. The letter indicated if any further errors occurred then disciplinary action\nwould be taken. Training records indicated Supervisor 1 is up to date on all his\nrequired training, and he is a trainer for the behavior management techniques used\nat the facility.\nI reviewed the manual for “Nonviolent Crisis Intervention” (CPI) used by the facility.\nThere were no physical interventions that would involve a staff touching or coming\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "close to touching a youth in the neck area or pushing a youth.\nI reviewed the facility’s Policy and Procedure for “non-violent Restraint”, Policy 5:10.\nThis policy states, “staff should only use the minimum amount of force necessary”\nand “should assess the situation”.\nI reviewed the video recording of the incident. The recording begins at 10:59:14.017\n-10:59:56.510 AM 06/26/2021 with a view of the “pod” in which the incident took\nplace. Staff and Youth A are observed entering the area. There are four staff present\nand Youth A walks away from the staff and removes his sweatshirt. Youth A is\nobserved to be trying to get back to the door they entered the area from, and staff\nare surrounding him and attempting to block his path. One staff is escorting Youth A\naway from the door and towards his room. Another staff is walking ahead and\nappears to be opening the bedroom door. The other staff are standing between\nYouth A and the door leading to the other area. Youth A appears to be struggling to\nget away from the staff who are holding him by his arms. Other staff are standing\njust outside of arms reach surrounding Youth A. Supervisor 1 is observed walking\ninto the area. The other staff have a hold of Youth A and are surrounding him. Staff\n2 escorts Youth A towards his room when Youth A steps upon a chair. Supervisor 1\nis standing in front of Youth A with Staff 2 holding him from behind. Other staff are\nstanding close by and surround them. Staff 2 begins to move Youth A off the chair\nand towards his room. Supervisor 1 moves forward and grabs Youth A near the neck\narea. His left hand appears to be on the neck area while his right hand is on Youth\nA’s left shoulder. Staff 2, Youth A, and Supervisor 1 move just out of camera view\nbut just prior, Supervisor 1 can be observed moving his hands from near the neck\narea of Youth A.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10177 Resident restraint.\n(1) The facility shall establish and follow written policy and\nprocedures specifying the use of resident restraint.\nANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews, written documentation\nand video review do support the allegations of Supervisor 1 not\nfollowing the written policies and procedures during the restraint\nof Youth A. Although, the allegation of Supervisor 1 choking\nYouth A is not supported as evidenced by most witnesses and\nthe video recording. It is clear Supervisor 1 failed to follow the\napproved CPI techniques sanctioned by the facility.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
