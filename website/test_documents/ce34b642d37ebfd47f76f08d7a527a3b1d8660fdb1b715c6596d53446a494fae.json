    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\n2.) The clients served by the facility are not part of the plaintiff class and therefor the\nfacility is not required to follow the ISEP.\n3.) The facility does not hold a contract with MDHHS/Children Services, so it is not\nsubject to contract or policy requirements.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility did not require technical assistance at this time.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require consultation at this time.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nSince the facility’s interim inspection in 2020 the facility had a Special Evaluation\n2021C0103011 in which a staff had inappropriate relationships with youth at the\nfacility, at another facility, and youth who had been discharged. The investigation did\nhave a finding of maltreatment in care and the facility was placed on a first provisional\nlicense. The facility was cited for R 400.4109 Program statement due to staff not\nfollowing the facility’s code of conduct. Because of the inappropriate nature of the\ncontact between the staff and youth the facility was cited for R 400.4112 Criminal\nhistory check, subject to requirements: staff qualifications. They were also cited for R\n400.4126 Sufficiency of staff due to female staff being left alone with male residents.\n4",
    "Throughout this six-month period the facility has done extensive work to train their\nstaff and supervisors on the code of conduct and appropriate boundaries between\nstaff and youth. Monthly unannounced visits to the home found that the facility had\nhired new staff and when questioned the new and old staff all confirmed their\ntrainings in boundaries and the code of conduct. The facility is in the process of hiring\na new supervisor. All corrective actions were implemented and continue to be in\nplace.\nAs with many other CCI’s in the State of Michigan Samaritas Jackson House\nstruggles to find quality staff. They have posted positions in many different forums\nand have offered incentives, yet it is still a struggle. The facility maintains their staff to\nyouth ratio however they are relying on a fewer number of staff to fill the shifts.\nThere have been no other findings or concerns since the provisional license was\nissued.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the facility be issued a regular license.\n9/1/21\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
