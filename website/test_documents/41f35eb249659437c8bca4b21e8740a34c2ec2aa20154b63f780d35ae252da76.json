DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The agency was informed that DCWL is no longer auditing any DHHS\nPolicy. DCWL Consultants will only be auditing those rules described in\nthe \"Licensing Rules for Child Placing Agencies\" rule book.\n• The agency was also informed that a social work contact documenting\nthat the foster care worker reviewed the PATP with the foster parent and\nother relevant parities and provided them with a copy of the treatment plan\nwould meet the rule when obtaining signatures was not possible.\nV. CONSULTATION\n• Consultation was not requested or required at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\n2",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual policy is as follows: The\nagency submitted an approved corrective action plan on 6-5-2024 in response to\nthose policy violations established during the renewal audit completed on 5-9-\n2025. The violations are as follows: FOM 722-08D Treatment Plans, FOM 722-\n06B Family Team Meeting, FOM 722-06H Case Contacts, and FOM 810-03\nMedical Passports. The current interim inspection did not establish repeat\nviolations indicating the CAP was successful in preventing repeat violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrators Annual Assessment was reviewed. The report\ndocuments that the agency reviewed their 2024 CAP and implemented corrective\nactions by 7-8-24. The assessment identified various barriers to rule compliance\nsuch as the lack of readily available medical services within the primary service\ndelivery area. Other barriers include absent or AWOL parents and homeless\nparents making it difficult to conduct reunification efforts. The agency has\nexperienced other barriers however staff retention is not one of them. Some staff\nare new and learning which can impact compliance, however there is a solid team\nin place.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a budget for the year as well as a certified public\naccountant audit of the agency. There were no financial concerns identified.\nStaff Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported feeling like they are members of a supportive foster\ncare team. Staff reported they can rely on each other when needed. Staff also\nreported their respective supervisors are supportive and readily available for\nassistance when needed. Staff further reported their supervisors are\nknowledgeable and provide consultation when requested.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is in a modern building located on tribal property. There is sufficient\noffice space. There is a spacious lobby and a receptionist to assist the public\nseeking services. No concerns were observed.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\n3",
