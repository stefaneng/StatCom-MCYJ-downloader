The 18-year old’s foster\nyouth’s bed room was observed with no reported concerns, a photo of the youth’s.\nbedroom was provided. No weapons, firearms or ammunition were in the home.\nThere was a working cell phone; medications and cleaning supplies were\nappropriately stored; there was operable running water, working utilities, toilets,\nsinks, and the home has an ADT security system. A concern was noted related to\nthe home’s roof/ceiling. The relative reported some drywall and roof repair is\nneeded. The relative reported the two rooms are unoccupied/only used for\nstorage. The plan is to obtain a repair assessment by a company located across\nfrom the relative’s home when the weather is warmer.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJune 14, 2023\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 15, 2023\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\n15",
