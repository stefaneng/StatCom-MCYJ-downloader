Interview with Foster Care Worker\n1.\n09/21/2022 Contact – Face to Face, Video conference pre-exit with LD.\nALLEGATION:\nFoster Care Worker 1 moved foster youth from placement without cause.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 7/28/22 Foster Parent 1 reported to DCWL that two foster children were removed\nfrom their home before a DHHS investigation was completed. Foster Parent 1 was\ntold by the agency that the move was temporary. However, the DHHS investigation\nis now concluded, and the children have not been returned to the home. In addition,\n2",
    "Foster Care Worker 1 did not provide Foster Parent 1 with a DHHS-30 as required at\nthe time of the move. Foster Care Worker 1 sent the DHHS-30 to Foster Parent 1\napproximately two weeks after the move. Foster Parent 1 refused to sign the form as\nit indicated Foster Parent 1 asked for the children to be removed, which was untrue.\nFoster Parent 1 reported Foster Care Worker 1 then began ignoring her calls and\nemails. On 7/20/22, Foster Parent 1 was informed by the agency that Foster Care\nWorker 1 was no longer employed.\nLicensee Designee (LD)\nOn 7/28/22 an on-site visit occurred at the agency where Licensee Designee (LD)\nwas interviewed in person. LD reported Foster Care Worker 1 is no longer with the\nagency, as she left employment on 7/15/22. LD reported Child A was hospitalized\non 6/5/22 after being violent and striking out at Foster Parent 1. Child A was not\napproved for in-patient care and discharged back to the foster home. Another\nincident occurred on 6/6/22 in which Child A was being aggressive and violent. This\nincident led to an allegation of improper behavior management and a special\nevaluation. After the special evaluation was initiated, Child A was moved to another\nhome. Foster Parent 1 and 2 had requested the move and the agency agreed it was\nin Child A’s best interest at that time. However, Child A’s siblings, Child B & Child C,\nremained in the foster home. On 6/22/22 an FTM was held regarding the special\nevaluation and findings. DHHS reported it was “more than likely” there would be\nfindings, which meant Child B and Child C would need to move from the home.\nHowever, DHHS had not yet completed their report. Foster Parent 1 told Foster Care\nWorker 1 that she would like Child B and Child C moved. LD was not present at this\nmeeting and indicated that only Foster Care Worker 1 had direct knowledge of this\nrequest.\nOn 6/24/22 Licensing Worker contacted Foster Parent 1 and informed her that a\nplacement was found. Replacement occurred on 6/27/2022. A few days later the\nagency was informed that DHHS was not going to have findings after all. However,\nthere were charges pending with law enforcement. At that time, the agency\nanticipated their special evaluation would have licensing violations regarding\nbehavior management. Because of the licensing findings and possible criminal\ncharges, returning the children to the foster home was not considered.\nOn 7/18/22 Foster Parent 1 emailed Foster Care Supervisor 1 and asked to have the\nchildren returned to her home. On 7/21/22 Foster Care Supervisor 1 notified Foster\nParent 1 that Foster Care Worker 1 was no longer with the agency and a new\nsupervisor was assigned. Foster Care Supervisor 1 also informed Foster Parent 1\nthat there were no plans to move the children back to the foster home at that time.\nOn 7/27/22 an internal meeting occurred, where it was discussed that Licensing\nWorker would contact the foster parents and update them on the special evaluation\nfindings. On 7/28/22 the new worker, Foster Care Worker 2, replied to an email from\nFoster Parent 1, and explained the agency would not be moving the youth back to\nthe foster home at that time. The worker explained that reunification was in process\nand the children’s new placement was within the school district where their parent’s\n3",
    "live, which would help with transitioning the youth home when reunification occurred.\nThe new foster home was close to the parent’s home, which also helped with\nvisitation. For those reasons, the agency felt another placement change was\nunnecessary for Child B and Child C. The agency was hopeful the kids next move\nwould be their return home.\nLD forwarded the emails that were discussed during the interview. The emails\nverified the information provided by the LD.\nLicensing Worker\nOn 8/13/22 an interview was conducted with Licensing Worker via Teams. Licensing\nWorker was unavailable on the day of the site visit. Licensing Worker reported she\nwas the assigned worker for the foster home and completed the recent special\nevaluation. Licensing Worker stated DHHS Worker anticipated they would have\nfindings in the investigation which would require Child B and Child C to move from\nthe home. However, the agency did not want to move the kids until they knew for\nsure and had the DHHS report. A family team meeting (FTM) occurred on\nWednesday 6/22/22, with DHHS, the foster parents, Foster Care Worker 1, and\nLicensing Worker to discuss the likely outcome of the investigation. Foster Parent 1\nwas very upset. Foster Parent 2 discussed moving out of the home, to allow Child B\nand Child C to remain there. The foster parents were encouraged to take some time\nto think about things. However, Foster Parent 1 said if the move was inevitable\nbecause of the DHHS findings, they would rather have the kids move sooner than\nlater. Licensing Worker told the foster parents the agency was still waiting for the\nfinal word from DHHS and the foster parents should take the weekend to talk things\nover. The following day, Foster Parent 1 called Licensing Worker and said she\nwanted to have Child B and Child C moved. Foster Parent 1 expressed she wanted\nthe kids moved before 1:00 Monday (6/27/22) as Foster Parent 2 would be at work,\nand the kids move would be too hard on him. Licensing Worker contacted Foster\nParent 1 again that Friday (6/24/22) to confirm the move, as she though the foster\nparent may have second thoughts. However, Foster Parent 1 agreed to contact the\nnew foster parent to provide information and make arrangements for the move. The\nkids then moved Monday, 6/27/22.\nAfter the move occurred, Foster Parent 1 told Licensing Worker that she wished to\nprovide permanence to the kids if reunification did not occur. However, prior\nconversations with Foster Parent 1 never included discussion of the move being\ntemporary or the kids moving back to the home.\nAbout two weeks after the move, the agency was informed DHHS did not have\nfindings in their investigation. After the foster parents were informed of this\ninformation by DHHS, Foster Parent 1 called Licensing Worker and wanted to\ndiscuss when Child B and Child C could return to the home. The agency then had an\ninternal meeting to discuss the situation. It was determined the children would stay in\ntheir new placement, as they were close to reunification and living in their parent’s\ncommunity. Foster Parent 1 was frustrated by this decision.\n4",
    "Foster Care Worker 2 (FCW2)\nAn interview was conducted via Teams on 8/13/22. Foster Care Worker 2 (FCW2)\nwas assigned to the children’s case in July 2022. FCW 2 reported being new to the\ncase as of 7/7/22. FCW2 was not present for the TDM or other phone calls. FCW2\nreviewed the case file and did not recall seeing any documentation about Child B\nand Child C’s removal being a temporary situation.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1\nAn interview was conducted via Teams on 8/16/22. Supervisor recalled that Foster\nCare Worker 1 and Licensing Worker had the most contact with the foster parents.\nBoth staff reported Foster Parent 1 said she wanted Child B and Child C to be\nmoved, because it seemed inevitable, and they were about to have family visiting\nthe home for an extended period of time. Supervisor did not attend the 6/22/22 FTM\nand she was on vacation when the move occurred on 6/27/22.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 recalled the foster parents were upset that they did not\nreceive the DHS-30 at the time of the move. When Foster Care Worker 1 later\nprovided it, the foster parents refused to sign it, because it was not given to them\ntimely. Foster Care Supervisor 1 had a meeting with the foster parents on 8/4/22 to\ndiscuss their concerns. The foster parents were informed of the agency’s decision to\nleave the children in their current placement. The foster parents seemed to\nunderstand that decision and did not pursue the issue further.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 stated she was unaware of any plans for the children’s\nmove to be temporary. However, there may have been some misunderstanding\nbetween the foster parents and worker. The new placement was intended to be\nshort term, only because reunification with the children’s parents was expected to\noccur shortly after.\nFoster Parent 1 (Complainant)\nOn 9/12/22 a phone interview occurred with Foster Parent 1 (FP1). FP1 stated Child\nB and Child C never should have been removed from the home. FP1 reported after\nthe DHHS investigation interviews occurred, a Family Team Meeting (FTM) was held\non 6/22/22 to discuss the findings. During the meeting it was discussed that if there\nwere not findings, the children (Child B & C) could stay in the home. If there were\nDHHS findings, the children would need to be moved. At that time, Child A had\nalready been moved from the home. During the meeting, the DHHS Worker\nindicated she would be off over the July 4th holiday, therefore a decision would not\nbe made until after that time. FP1 reported they had family coming to visit over the\nholiday as well and asked the agency if they should move the children. The agency\nresponded that a decision did not need to be made at that time, and they would wait\nuntil after DHHS findings were known. Everyone was in agreement to maintain the\nplacement until DHHS concluded their investigation. After the FTM, Foster Care\n5",
    "Worker 1 contacted FP1 twice, asking if they needed respite. FP1 declined the offer\nfor respite. On 6/24/22 Licensing Worker informed FP1 that a new placement was\nlocated for Child B & C. Licensing Worker stated the move was arranged as the\noutcome of the investigation was known and DHHS had findings which did not allow\nthe children to stay in the home. Licensing Worker indicated the move may be\ntemporary until the investigation was complete. FP1 told Licensing Worker that if the\nagency planned to move the children, they should do it while her husband was at\nwork, because he would be upset. It was agreed the children would move on\n6/27/22. At the time of the move, Child B and C were upset, and FP1 reassured\nthem the move was only temporary. FP1 recalled a later conversation with the new\nfoster parent in which they stated the move was intended to be permanent all along.\nOn 7/11/22 DHHS worker told FP1 there were no findings from the investigation.\nFP1 contacted FCW1 to request a meeting to discuss findings and a plan to\ntransition the children back to the home. FP1 stated she made several attempts to\ncontact FCW1, with no response. On 7/19/22 the agency informed her that FCW1\nwas no longer employed there, and a new worker was assigned (FCW2). FCW2\ncontacted FP1 on 7/28/22 to discuss the situation and schedule a meeting. At the\nmeeting on 8/4/22, the agency stated they were not going to move the children back\nto FP1’s home. The agency said the children were settled at the new home and had\nbegun receiving required services. The agency also informed FP1 that DHHS initially\nstated there would be findings in the investigation, which is what caused the move.\nHowever, after the children were moved, DHHS reported there would not be\nfindings. FP1 indicated she did not believe this was true, as she spoke with DHHS\nWorker and was never told this information.\nFoster Parent’s Daughter\nOn 9/12/22 a brief phone interview was conducted with the adult daughter of the\nfoster parents. She reported being present during the 6/22/22 FTM call as a support\nperson for her parents. During the call, there was no decision to move the children\nfrom the home; neither foster parents requested the children to be moved.\nRespite Worker\nOn 9/16/22 a phone interview was conducted with someone identified as a respite\ncare provider for the foster family. Respite Worker reported being present for the\n6/22/22 FTM call as a support person to the foster family. Respite Worker stated\nduring the call DHHS Worker indicated she was unsure what the findings would be.\nA plan was not developed during that call to move the kids. However, FP1 did state\nthat if the decision was made to move the kids, the agency should do it before they\nhad family visiting over the 4th of July holiday.\nDHHS\nOn 9/16/22 a Teams interview was conducted with DHHS worker. The information\nprovided by DHHS worker was consistent with agency staff. DHHS worker stated at\nthe time of the 6/22/22 FTM, it appeared there was enough information to have\nfindings that would result in the removal of Child B and C. At the FTM, the agency\n6",
    "and foster parent were encouraged not to make any decision until the report was\nfinalized as DHHS worker needed to confirm the findings with supervision. However,\nFP1 stated she would rather move the youth before the holiday, because they\nplanned to have family visiting and did not want to deal with the investigation and\nkids being moved while family was visiting. However, Licensing Worker encouraged\nFP1 to take time to think about it. According to the agency, FP1 called the day after\nthe meeting and asked to have the kids moved. Overall, DHHS worker indicated\nthere was a disconnect between the agency and FP1, resulting in trust issues and\nmiscommunication. DHHS worker could tell there was tension with FCW1 and FP1\nwhich may have contributed to a lack of clarity about the agency’s decision.\nFoster Care Worker 1\nA phone interview was conducted on 9/16/22 with FCW1. FCW1 reported that she\nleft employment with the agency in early July 2022. FCW1 stated that after an\nincident with Child A acting out violently, and an allegation of improper physical\ndiscipline by the foster parents, a special evaluation was initiated. Child A had been\nremoved from the home due to the special evaluation and also at the request of the\nfoster parents. There was some discussion about keeping the siblings placed\ntogether. However, before a determination could be made about placement for all\nthree children, DHHS reported there would be findings with the investigation and\nChild B and C would need to be moved. A meeting occurred on 6/22/22 in which the\nfoster parents were informed of the situation. A replacement decision was not made\nat that time. However, FP1 later called Licensing Worker and stated they had family\ncoming to stay over the holiday weekend, and the kids should be moved before\nthen. The kids were then moved to a new placement on 6/27/22. The new foster\nhome was in an area near their parents and the school the kids would continue to\nattend once reunification occurred. A few weeks after the kids moved, DHHS\nreported there would not be any findings after all.\nFCW1 stated she did not recall ever telling FP1 that the move was temporary. When\nFCW1 picked up the children to move them on 6/27/22, FP1 had all of the children’s\nbelongings packed. Which made it appear she understood the move was\npermanent. If the move were intended to be short-term, it seems FP1 would have\nonly packed a suitcase.\nDocument review\nOn 7/28/22 the children’s case file was reviewed. The following relevant information\nwas found:\n Child A, B and C were placed with Foster Parent 1 on 4/9/21. Child A moved\non 6/7/22, Child B and C moved on 6/27/22.\n A Special Evaluation was initiated on 6/7/22. The special evaluation was\nconducted in coordination with DHHS. It was alleged Foster Parent 2 used\ninappropriate behavior management with Child A. It was reported Foster\nParent 2 grabbed Child A’s arm, leaving a bruise, and hit his nose with his\nfinger. Foster Parent 1 reported the incident began when Child A was acting\nout violently toward her and also injuring himself. Foster Parent 1 reported\n7",
    "that Foster Parent 2 put his hands on Child A’s shoulders and pointed his\nfinger at Child A, accidentally hitting his nose. Foster Parent 2 confirmed\nFoster Parent 1’s account of events. The DHHS investigation closed on\n7/18/22, with no findings. The agency special evaluation closed on 9/7/22 with\na behavior management violation. A CAP was developed to bring the home\ninto compliance.\n The foster home had one prior special evaluation regarding behavior\nmanagement in April 2022. No violation was found.\n DHHS investigation report noted an FTM occurred on 6/22/22 to discuss\ninvestigation findings. At that time, there appeared to be enough evidence to\nsupport findings. However, it was later determined there would not be any\nfindings. This information was shared with the family on 7/11/22.\n 6/22/22 FTM documentation from DHHS showed the following people in\nattendance: FP1, FP2, Foster Parent’s Daughter, Respite Worker, DHHS\nWorker, Licensing Worker. Participants discussed likely outcome of\ninvestigation and findings, and what that meant regarding placement. Per\nreport, “pending supervisory approval, this will be a substantiated case”. FP1\nsuggested, “changing placement sooner than later since it seems inevitable,\nand they’ll have family visiting the next two weeks”. “Licensing Worker and\nFP1 will touch base Friday 6/24 to discuss placement”.\n Emails, from 7/19/22 and 7/28/22, between Foster Parent 1 and Foster Care\nWorker 2 were observed. In the emails, FCW2 explained the reasons why the\nchildren would not be returned to Foster Parent 1’s home. Foster Parent 1\nmaintained she believe the removal was temporary.\n Email from FCW 2 to Foster Parent 1, providing the agency’s grievance\npolicy.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-03D Placement Change\nPage 2\nWhen a caseworker suspects a child in foster care has suffered\nsexual abuse or non-accidental physical injury, or there is a\nsubstantial risk of harm to the child's emotional well-being or\nphysical safety in the caregiver's home, a CPS complaint and a\nlicensing complaint must be made immediately.\nAdditionally:\n• If the caseworker believes the child is at substantial risk in the\nhome, then child must be moved immediately. If the child is\nmoved due to the allegations, the caregiver may appeal the\ndecision to the Foster Care Review Board (FCRB). The appeal\ndoes not prevent the move…\n8",
    "ANALYSIS: Based on interviews and documents reviewed, it was\ndetermined the agency made a placement decision based on\nthe information they had at the time, that DHHS had findings in\ntheir investigation. The agency’s placement decision is in\nalignment with contract/policy item FOM 722-03D. Therefore, no\nviolation is found.\nRegarding Foster Parent’s assertion the agency initially reported\nthe move to be temporary, then made the move permanent\nwithout discussing it, no violation is found. There was conflicting\ninformation reported by the Foster Parent, support persons,\nagency staff, and DHHS regarding the plan for the children’s\nmove. In addition, policy does not prohibit staff from moving\nyouth on a temporary basis, then changing the placement to a\npermanent one if the placement meets the children’s needs.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThere are concerns procedure was not followed and communication was lacking\nthroughout and following this.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring a review of MiSACWIS documents relevant to this investigation, it was found\nthat a DHS-30, Foster Parent/Caregiver Notification of Move, was not uploaded into\nMiSACWIS.\nInterviews with Foster Parent 1, Licensee Designee, and Foster Care Worker 1\nconfirmed the DHS-30 was not completed or provided to the foster parent as\nrequired.\nEmail documentation was reviewed and verified Foster Care Worker 1 sent the\nDHS-30 to Foster Parent 1 via email on 7/14/22; 17 days after the replacement\noccurred. Foster Parent 1 refused to sign the document as it was not provided\ntimely.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-03D Placement Change\nPage 4\nThe caregiver must be notified of the intent to move the child 14\ndays prior to the intended date of the move unless the child’s\nhealth or safety is jeopardized.
