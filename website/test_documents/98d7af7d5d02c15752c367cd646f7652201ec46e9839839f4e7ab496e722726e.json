Staff 1 did not have\nYouth A in a restraint and was not restricting Youth A’s free\nmovement. Per PA 116 this was not a restraint as Youth A had\nfree movement of her body. In reviewing the video footage, this\nwas unable to be seen as the video camera angle does not show\nwhere this occurred.\nAdditional Findings:\nThe facility is found in noncompliance for Staff 2’s restraint with\nYouth A as Staff 2 was holding Youth A around the waist as he\nwas unable to secure Youth A’s arms in the upper torso restraint\nwhen Youth A was attempting to throw the chair which is not a\ntrained SCM hold technique.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2023C000770SI dated 10/18/23; CAP Approved 11/14/23\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4163 Health Status Assessment; notification;\nSection debriefing; reporting.\nDescription (5) An agency will provide an incident report on a form prescribed\nby the department for each incident involving the use of seclusion\nor restraint.
