The investigation\ndetermined violation of rule 400.12206 staff qualifications. A CAP was approved\non 11/14/2022 and was completed.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan in response to the\nrenewal inspection completed on 9/28/2022 with a corrective action plan approved\non 10/17/2022. During the review the agency had fifteen violations. Nine citations\nwere noted as repeat violations in the current inspection. During this period under\nreview the agency noted that overall compliance was impacted, in a part, by\nincreased staff turnover as well as increased placement issues.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment period reported the agency's difficulty in meeting requirements\nduring this review period. The Chief Administrator stated challenges to meeting\ncompliance include short turnaround times for certain documents such as PATP’s\nand DHS 1105’s. In addition, difficult cases are becoming more frequent and take\nup a lot of time for staff. The previous year CAP has been, in part, successful,\nhowever increased staff turnover during the past year has been challenging as\nwell as a high number of replacements.\nThe CA indicated the agency has come up with monitoring activities they feel will\nassist with overall compliance. Case managers will utilize calendar reminders for\nservice plan and PATP signature due dates. New case managers will be matched\nwith a peer mentor to assist with task completion. The CA expressed confidence\nthat several areas will improve over the next review period.\nFinancial Overview\nFinancial records were reviewed and there were no concerns identified.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via telephone. Staff report feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisors are available and coworkers assist as\nneeded. Staff did not report any concerns or areas of need.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, licensing and independent living services. All files were\nstored securely.\n9",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nN/A\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
