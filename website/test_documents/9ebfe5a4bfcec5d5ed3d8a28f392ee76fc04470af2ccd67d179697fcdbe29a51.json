    "development, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency has not provided reunification services to parent.\nInvestigation On 6/16/25 Complainant reported to DCWL that the agency had\nnot provided reunification services to Parent 1. Complainant\nstated Foster Care Worker “flat out refused resources and\nservices”. The case had been open over a year and a petition to\nterminate parental rights was filed. One of the reasons for filing\ntermination was due to a lack of housing, which the agency failed\nto assist with. The agency told Parent 1 that after completing a\nthree-month substance use program, they would provide a\nhousing voucher. But that never happened. Parent 1 reported a\nhistory of domestic violence to the agency, but did not receive any\nservices to address it. Complainant stated the case has dragged\nout intentionally to keep the children in care. Complainant\ndisagreed with the children being in foster care at all, and\nindicated there was no abuse or neglect, and the children should\nnot have been removed from Parent 1. Complainant stated Parent\n1 was in full compliance with their treatment plan. Services that\nhad not been provided include drug testing, housing, counseling,\nand visitation.\nInterviews:\nParent 1 was contacted via email on 6/16/25 and provided with\nquestions regarding the allegation. Parent 1 reported several\nconcerns regarding MDHHS Children’s Services and the\ninvestigation that brought the children into care. However, those\nconcerns are outside of the purview of DCWL. Parent 1 also\nexpressed concerns regarding the police, prosecutor and court,\nwhich are also outside of the scope of DCWL. Regarding Bethany\nChristian Services, Parent 1 stated Foster Care Worker refused to\nprovide her with services. Parent 1 indicated she spoke with\nFoster Care Supervisor, but it did not help the situation. Parent 1\nalso stated her lawyer was not doing anything to help her. Parent\n1 stated she had not received assistance with housing, food,\ntransportation, jobs, clothing, domestic violence counseling,\ndivorce proceedings, or medical care. Parent 1 recalled she had\nreceived $20 in gas cards, but that was all. Parent 1 reported she\nset up her own services through Arbor Circle, as well as therapy,\nrehabilitation, transportation, and substance abuse treatment.\nParent 1 stated she was in compliance with the treatment plan,\n2",
    "but did not do “every single thing” because the agency wasn’t\nproviding services. Parent 1 stated she did not have phone calls\nwith her children while incarcerated. Parent 1 stated there were a\nfew times when she arrived at the agency for parenting time, and\nwas told it was cancelled due to her husband’s behavior. Parent 1\nfelt degraded by the workers and felt that no one would help her.\nParent 1 reported that she was going to forensic fluids for\nsubstance use testing, but someone told her she did not have to\nsince she was also doing testing at a medical clinic. The agency\nthen changed their mind and denied ever agreeing to that plan.\nParent 1 stated she believed the relative caregiver for her son had\na household member that was using drugs and drove with her\nchild in the car. Parent 1 reported this to the agency, but the\nagency did not do anything. Parent 1 stated she asked for a new\nworker but continues to have the same one.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was contacted by email on\n6/26/25 and interviewed via video call on 6/30/25. FCS reported\nshe met with Parent 1 the week prior. Parent 1 had some\nquestions about the recommendation for termination. FCS\nexplained that Parent 1 had not participated at all when the case\nbegan in April 2024 and failed to follow through with\nrecommended services. Parent 1 was upset because she felt that\nshe completed everything she needed to do. When FCS asked\nabout services completed, Parent 1 did not have clear answers.\nFCS explained what was needed in order to move past\ntermination and keep working towards reunification. FCS stated\nthey had a lot of repeat conversations as Parent 1 seemed to\nhave difficulty understanding. However, the bottom line was that\nthe termination recommendation occurred due to the case being\nover a year old, Parent 1 being incarcerated for six months, in\nrehab for three months, and refusing to complete services after\nbeing released.\nFCS reported that Foster Care Worker (FCW) drove Parent 1\naround to obtain drug screen result documentation; to help show\nshe was compliant in that area. FCW received a packet of papers,\nwith a note on top stating that Parent 1 did not want the drug\nscreen results shared with FCW. As a result of Parent 1 not\nsharing information, she is considered to not be following the\ntreatment plan. FCS stated that to her knowledge Parent 1 had\nnot requested a worker change.\nProgram Manager was contacted by email on 6/26/25 and\ninterviewed via video call on 6/30/25. Program Manager stated\nshe had never received a complaint about FCW. Program\n3",
    "Manager also stated she never received a request from Parent 1\nto change the case worker, nor had she received a grievance from\nParent 1. Program Manager stated to her knowledge Parent 1 was\nnot difficult to work with. Parent 1 would yell and scream at the\nworker when she became upset, but she would calm down\nquickly. Program Manager noted that some parenting time was\nnot completed, as the oldest child was refusing to visit with Parent\n1.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was contacted by email on 6/26/25\nand interviewed via video call on 6/30/25. Follow-up occurred with\nFCW on 7/21/25 and 7/29/25 for additional information. FCW\nreported Parent 1 was released from jail in February 2025 and\nentered treatment at that time. FCW spoke with Parent 1 and her\ntherapist about completing the 90-day program, and what other\nservices were available while there, and post discharge. Parent 1\ncompleted the program in May 2025 and moved in with a relative.\nFCW visited the home, found it to be appropriate, and discussed\nhaving the children live there. Parent 1 inquired about a housing\nvoucher through Family Reunification Planning and was informed\none would be provided after all other reunification barriers were\nremoved. The additional barriers included substance abuse,\nemployment, and domestic violence. Once those services were\ncomplete, a housing voucher would be issued. Parent 1 was\nworking with a treatment program where she received therapy and\nhad a sobriety coach. FCW maintained contact with the sobriety\ncoach to ensure Parent 1 was engaged and benefiting from\nservices. Parent 1 continued to provide drug screens through the\ntreatment program, as well as through the Methadone clinic.\nHowever, FCW was unable to obtain results from the clinic. The\nagency received a 54-page packet from the clinic, but the packet\ndid not have the drug screen results and the front page stated that\nthe client (Parent 1) only wanted the dates released to the agency\nand not the results. Currently Parent 1 is screened twice weekly\nthrough two different facilities.\nFCW reported visits were never withheld. Visitation occurred twice\nper week after being released from jail. However, one of the\nchildren refused to visit about every other week while visits were\nat the rehabilitation facility. Since the visits moved to the agency,\nthe child has been consistently attending. FCW noted there was a\ncourt order regarding visits which stated Parent 1 needed to arrive\nan hour early, in order to complete a drug screen and confirm visit\nattendance.\n4",
    "FCW reported a lack of housing was not the main reason that a\ntermination trial was scheduled. Although housing was still a\nbarrier. The agency provided Parent 1 with a list of housing\nresources, but a voucher could not be provided until all other\nbarriers were addressed as part of the procedure for West\nMichigan Partnership for Children. This was explained to Parent 1\non a few occasions when she had asked for a voucher. Parent 1\nasked FCW for a letter stating that housing was her last barrier.\nFCW did not provide the letter, as that information was inaccurate.\nCompliance with services and sobriety needs to occur for six\nmonths before the agency can report the barrier was fully\naddressed. Regarding the statement that Parent 1 was told the\nagency would not pursue termination if she completed treatment,\nFCW stated that was not how the conversation went. FCW spoke\nwith Parent 1 about termination being recommended due to the\nlength of the time the case had been open, and the lack of\nprogress. FCW informed Parent 1 that due to being incarcerated\nand in treatment for a significant portion of the case, it was\npossible the termination recommendation would be denied in\norder to allow Parent 1 more time to continue working on services.\nLastly, regarding Complainant’s concern about Household\nMember at the relative caregiver’s home, FCW reported this\nconcern was voiced early in the case. Parent 1 initially reported\nthat she was in a car accident when she was younger and it was\ncaused by Household Member. Parent 1 told FCW that she did\nnot trust Household Member and did not want him to drive her\nchild around. FCW stated Household Member reported he had a\nsubstance abuse issue, for which he received treatment.\nHousehold Member reported being sober and actively working\nthrough recovery since 2019. In addition, Household Member\nsuccessfully completed probation for possession of substances.\nFCW stated the agency received a statement from the treatment\nprogram that reported Household Member was following the\nprogram. A driving record was also obtained and found to be\ncurrent and valid. FCW did not report any concerns about\nHousehold Member.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Court orders dated 12/4/24, and 3/4/25 indicated that\nreasonable efforts were made to achieve permanency.\nServices included scheduled intakes, parenting time, visit\ncoach, parenting specialist, drug screens, family team\nmeetings, housing assistance, parent nurturing referral, and\npsychological evaluation.\n5",
    "• The 4/3/25 Updated Service Plan recommended\ntermination. A termination trial was adjourned 4/21/25, then\ncontinued 6/11/25.\n• Parenting-time plan required two hours of visitation per\nweek, in the office, supervised. Parenting-time case\ncontacts were reviewed and found parenting-time to be\noffered as required. However, there were some cancelled\nvisits at the beginning of the case due to parent\nincarceration, parent not confirming they would attend visit,\nand youth refusing to visit.\n• 7/2/2025 Parent Agency Treatment Plan (PATP) noting\nareas of need for Parent 1:\no Substance Abuse- Goal: gain and maintain sobriety.\n“Partial” Progress: Parent 1 successfully completed\n90-day program on 5/29/25.
