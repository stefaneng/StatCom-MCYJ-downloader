    "Documents Reviewed:\n• Michigan Department of Health & Human Services Incident\nReport 171730213 for Youth A going AWOL. The incident\nreport is consistent with staff and youth interviews.\n• Truancy Policy and Procedure: Policy reads, Local law\nenforcement personnel will be notified immediately and\nreferring agency worker will be notified within one hour.\nThe policy also reads, once a client returns, all other parties\nnotified of truancy must also be notified at the time of\nreturn.\n• Vassar Police Department Case Report 240000055\nregarding Youth A’s AWOL. Report indicates on\n1/10/2024, at approximately 1720 hours an officer was\ndispatched to the facility for a runaway juvenile. The officer\nwas told Youth A was last seen by staff walking near Camp\n3, approximately 15 minutes prior to calling 911. The same\nofficer who was dispatched noted in the police report he\nobserved Youth A on Water Street, at approximately 1650\nhours, approximately 26 minutes before the facility reported\nYouth A AWOL.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance for not notifying the\nlicensing authority and referring agency of Youth A’s AWOL until\nYouth A returned to the facility. The facility had been making\nnotifications of a youths’ AWOL once the youths returned, not\nwhen the youths first went AWOL. The facility was unaware they\nneeded to notify when a youth first went AWOL.\nThe facility notified law enforcement at 5:16pm of Youth A’s\nAWOL. Text messages indicate Youth A was last seen at\n4:38pm. Staff 1, OM, and Supervisor reported searching the gym\nand cabins, not locating Youth A, and then contacting 911. The\ncall was made to 911 approximately 38 minutes after staff last had\neyes on Youth A.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe agency should review and update Truancy policy to ensure it\nis clear when a youth is considered AWOL vs truant and that all\nparties are to be notified immediately when youth is determined\nAWOL, not within 1 hour or other specific timeframes.\nIt was recommended to the facility staff are trained to notify the\nlicensing authority and referring agency of youths going AWOL\nonce it has been determined youths are AWOL, not only when\nyouths return to the facility.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nFebruary 14, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nBarbara A Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 15, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
