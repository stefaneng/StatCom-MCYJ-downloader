    "(b) A written corrective action plan has been\ndeveloped. The plan must comply with all of the\nfollowing requirements:\n(iii) Be signed and dated by the foster parent and the\nagency.\nOne of two open foster home records reviewed showed the foster home had a\nspecial evaluation that required a corrective action plan; and the corrective action\nplan on file was not signed by the agency or foster parents.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• R400.12325(3)(b)(ii) License recommendation: The agency was\napprised it shall consistently ensure for completion of the foster home’s\ncorrective action plan as required by the rule. If no date is listed, the date\ndeveloped with the foster home shall serve as that date. Additionally,\nCWLM issues preventing corrective action plan development or print out\nshall be timely worked through with the helpdesk.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• R400.12308(1) Application submission: The agency was advised\nensuring for consistent and regular social work contact entries in CWLM\non the status of the license being completed, (i.e. no monthly gaps) may\naid it in showing it is acting on a completed and signed application.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period. That corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024 Interim\ninspection where it received 9 rule violations. During this 2025 Renewal\ninspection the agency received 2 rule violations,1 of which was a repeat violation\nfrom 2024. The agency’s corrective action plan compliance around this 1 rule\nviolation is as follows: the number of individual cases cited remained the same, in\nthat 1 of 2 records was cited this year compared to 1 of 3 in 2024.",
    "A review of the agency’s 2024 Interim corrective action plan showed it completed\nand or implemented all aspects of the corrective action plan. Notwithstanding that,\nit is worth noting that the agency is still learning CWLM and has experienced some\ndifficulties around report generation and documentation. The agency admitted this\nis an area it is continuing to work on.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s (CA) report signed and dated\n6/9/2025. The CA reported the citations from 2024 and how action steps\nimplement to come into compliance. The reported indicated the corrective action\nplan enabled the agency to implement strategies that will have long term positive\nimpacts for its compliance to the personnel records rule, as well as the agency’s\nhiring practices for new staff. The agency reported its retention of staff,\nsupervisory overall support for the program, and increases in recruitment and in\nthe budget for recruitment are program strengths. An area of growth reported\nwas consistency in maintaining treatment foster homes and increasing the\nlicensing of treatment foster homes.\nDuring the entrance conference, the agency reported it has made some gains\ntoward licensing more foster homes. They reported their recruitment activities\nhave gone from 3 community outreaches a month, one of which included a\npresentation on a Podcast show. The agency attributed these community\noutreaches to having 6 enrolled foster homes. The licensing supervisor reported\nthey are shooting for licensing 1- 3 foster homes per year.\nThe chief administrator and licensing supervisor reported they are continuing to\nwork toward full compliance with the rules. They were also pleased with the fact\nthe number of violations the agency received this year decreased from the prior\nyear.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a 2025 annual budget, and independent financial audit dated\nfor 9/30/2024. A review of these documents did not show indications of any\nnotable areas of concern.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator and licensing supervisor, I\ninterviewed the licensing worker. No concerns were reported. Strengths for the\nagency were reported as the program’s tight-knit team; the wall of support from\nthe team and the administration; and the extra pay that’s offered. Area for growth\nwas cited as a need for the administration to reach out and do more to educate\nother components of The Guidance Center about the treatment foster care\nprogram and what the program does and offers.",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of this satellite office did not reveal any safety concerns. There\nappears to be sufficient equipment for staff; and licensing files were securely\nstored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis agency is not contracted with the Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices to provide foster care placement or certification services; therefore, this is\nnot applicable.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJune 23, 2025\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 24, 2025\n________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel\nArea Manager"
