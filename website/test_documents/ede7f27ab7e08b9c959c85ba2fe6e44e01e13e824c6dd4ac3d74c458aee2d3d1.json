    "Independent\nLiving Director\nIII. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12503 – Policy and Procedures\nSection\nDescription (2) The policies and procedures shall cover at least all of the\nfollowing areas:\n(h) Medical, dental, and mental health care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not provide adequate medical support.\nInvestigation I interviewed Agency Director on 07/05/2023. I reported to him\nthat I had not yet received the requested program statement\ninformation from Foster Care Worker 1. I asked if there was any\nand Agency Director 1 stated the program statement does\naddress the medical/health care issue. Agency Director 1 stated\nhe would submit that information to me. The information\nrequested was received 07/05/2023 from Agency Director.\nInformation from the Program statement includes as follows:\nTitle: Medical Care\nPolicy: Vista Maria shall ensure that a youth in an Independent\nLiving program receives all necessary medical and dental care. All\nmedical and dental care provided shall be documented in the\nyouth’s record.\nHealth Care\nEach youth will have physical and dental examinations and\ntreatments as needed while receiving services from Vista Maria. If\nwe do not get a copy of a recent physical or dental examination, a\nphysical or dental exam will be scheduled and completed. The ILP\nCaseworker will work with the youth in gathering information about\ntheir health conditions and any medications or treatments that are\nrecommended and/or provided.\nIL Specialists and upstairs staff are responsible for updating\nmedicine information in both the soft and hard files. When\nmedicine is picked up from the pharmacy, either the medicine\ninformation or the bottle should be copied and placed in both files.\n2",
    "Please Communicate All Medical Conditions and Needs\nDuring the course of a youth’s stay, he or she may become ill or\nsuffer an injury, and if this occurs, the youth should tell a\nresponsible adult in the program right away.\nThe youth should notify their ILP Caseworker of any needed\nmedical care that is not serious to warrant urgent, emergency\nroom or ambulance response, but requires care. Calls to the ILP\nCaseworker about emergency and urgent medical care should be\nmade no matter what time or day of the week.\nAny youth who are experiencing medical issues and feel as\nthough their medical need should be addressed immediately\nshould contact their ILP Caseworker for guidance and if an\nemergency, contact 911.\nAnalysis The agency does address medical/health care issues in their\nprogram statement and handbook that is given to youth who\nparticipate in the program as required by this rule.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code &\nSection CPA Rule 400.12502 – Program Statement\nDescription\n(1) An agency shall have and follow a current written program\nstatement that includes all of the following information:\n(g) Medical and dental care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not provide adequate medical support.\nInvestigation I interviewed State Worker 1 by telephone on 06/02/2023. State\nWorker 1 stated she interviewed Youth A at the agency on\n05/22/2023. State Worker 1 stated Youth A has Type 1 diabetes\nand Celiac's Disease. State Worker 1 stated Youth A reported not\nreceiving adequate support to appropriately address Youth A's\nmedical needs.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 at the agency with State\nWorker 1 on 06/05/2023. The supervisor for State Worker 1 also\nparticipated by telephone. Foster Care Worker 1 stated she would\nnormally pick up the medications needed by Youth A from the\npharmacy and give them to Youth A or place them in the\nrefrigerator of Youth A's room. Foster Care Worker 1 stated she\ndid not know staff working with Youth A needed training regarding\n3",
    "Type 1 diabetes until Youth A had already been in placement 3\nmonths. Foster Care Worker 1 stated Youth A would normally\nnotify Foster Care Worker 1 when Youth A was low on Youth A's\ninsulin/medications and Foster Care Worker 1 would pick them up\nand give them to Youth A. Foster Care Worker 1 stated she did\nnot log when Youth A is given prescriptions. Foster Care Worker 1\nstated the agency has a check in/out system and Youth A wasn't\ndoing that. Foster Care Worker 1 described Youth A as\noppositional and not wanting to be there. I asked Foster Care\nWorker 1 for a copy of the agency's program statement or\npolicies/procedures related to medical care for participants and\nFoster Care Worker 1 stated they did not have one. Note it has\nbeen established above that the agency does have a program\nstatement regarding health and dental care.\nI interviewed Youth A at the agency on 06/05/2023 with State\nWorker 1. The supervisor for State Worker 1 also participated by\ntelephone. Youth A stated she was first diagnosed with diabetes in\n2013 during the last 3 months of the 3rd grade. Youth A stated\nshe is currently doing OK but is not ready to manage her health\ncondition by herself. Youth A stated she had been out with her\nboyfriend for about a week, and she started to run out of insulin.\nYouth A stated she started to ration the insulin Youth A had and\nYouth A went to Foster Care Worker 1 and Agency Nurse 1.\nYouth A said Agency Nurse 1 told Youth A that Youth A would\nneed to take care of it herself. Youth A stated she called the\npharmacy to get a refill. Youth A said Foster Care Worker 1 told\nYouth A Foster Care Worker 1 would pick it up. Youth A reported\nother medications were there but not the insulin. Youth A stated\nshe rationed the insulin left. Youth A stated she is supposed to\nget 3 boxes monthly, and Youth A needs Gluten free food. Youth\nA stated her Bridge Card allowance is not enough to cover the\ntypes of food Youth A needs due Youth A's medical conditions.\nYouth A also stated she needs more help to manage her\nprescription process.\nI interviewed Agency Nurse 1 at the agency on 06/05/2023 with\nState Worker 1 and the supervisor for State Worker 1 also\nparticipated by telephone. Nurse 1 indicated she typically has little\nor no responsibility to participants in the independent living\nprogram regarding their medical needs. Nurse 1 reported she did\nhave some conversations with Youth A and attempted to help and\nprovide some direction to Youth A. Nurse 1 also stated the agency\ndoes not have a program statement for the independent living\nprogram that includes information related to medical/health care\npolicies and procedures.\n4",

The information requested\nwas received 07/05/2023 from Agency Director.\nAnalysis The agency does address medical/health care issues in their\nprogram statement and handbook that is given to youth who\nparticipate in the program. A significant part of the expectation for\ncompliance is that what is presented is also what is\nfollowed/implemented. This rule requires agency staff to follow a\ncurrent written program statement. Both staff working with Youth\nA were not aware of the program statement and were not\nimplementing the required services for compliance.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12504 – Eligibility requirements.\nSection\nDescription (2) All of the following shall be in the case record before a youth is\nplaced in independent living:\n(d) The availability of specific and relevant resources that\nprovide for suitable social, physical, educational, vocational, and\nemotional needs of a youth.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not provide adequate medical support.\nInvestigation I interviewed State Worker 1 by telephone on 06/02/2023.
