DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nCCI Rule 400.4407-1 Facility and premises maintenance\n(1) A facility and premises shall be maintained in a\nclean, comfortable, and safe condition. The facility shall\nbe located on land that is properly drained.\nDuring the on-site visit on 7/29/25 the facility indicated they had not requested an\nEnvironmental Health Inspection (EHI) from their local health department. When\nan inspection was received on 8/4/25 the inspection was completed on the",
    "incorrect form and with the incorrect rules. As of the date of this report a correct\nEHI has not been received.\nThe health inspector did find the following:\n• The Bathroom/Shower had holes in the walls/tile\n• There were no test strips for the cleaning solution.\n• The facility needs to use a cleaning solution that has a chemical\nconcertation verifiable with test strips. i.e. bleach or ammonia.\nCCI Rule 400.4409-2 Ventilation\n(2) During fly season, between May 1 and October 31,\neach door, window, and other opening to the outside\nwhich is used for ventilation purposes shall be\nsupplied with standard screens of not less than 16\nmesh.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The application, environmental and fire inspections were not complete upon\nvisit to the agency. The facility was able to get the fire and environmental\ninspection completed on 8/4/2025 but the environmental was completed\nincorrectly. This late request for the inspections does not leave enough time to\nwork out any violations or issues prior to the expiration of the license. EHI’s for\nCCI’s need to be completed utilizing the form specifically for CCI’s and the\nfacility should be ensuring they are requesting this of their health inspector.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency did not require consultation at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance",
    "The agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had one CAP as a result of SIR #2024SIC0001687 dated 8/15/24 with\na CAP approval date of 03/21/2025. The facility was found in violation of Rule\n109(1)(c) Program statement due to staff using tobacco products and not doing\nan incident report; Rule 128(3) Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training\ndue to staff lacking the required training hours and orientation; Rule 126 (1)\nSufficiency of staff due to inadequate staffing and appropriate supervision.\nOngoing monitoring of CAP compliance continues.

There were no concerns\nnoted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A",
    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nThis year has been a transitional period for the Sanctuary program, including\nchanges in key leadership roles. The Director of Homeless Youth Programs\nposition experienced turnover, and both the Counseling Manager and Case\nManager left the organization within a one-month span. Although offers were\nextended and accepted by qualified candidates for these roles, both offers\nultimately fell through due to circumstances unrelated to Lighthouse Sanctuary.\nThe Chief Administrator reported ongoing difficulty in maintaining staff in critical\npositions such as the Director, Manager of Counseling, Case Manager, and\nResidential Specialists. Despite these staffing challenges, current Sanctuary staff\nhave significantly increased their familiarity with CCI licensing rules. As a result,\ncompliance has improved across several areas, including those cited in the 2024\nCorrective Action Plan (CAP), with all concerns now fully addressed and\ncorrected.\nIn September 2024, a new Quality Performance and Compliance Manager\nposition was created. David Permaloff was hired at the end of that month and has\nsince taken on the role of Chief Administrator for CCI licensure. Following the\nresignation of the RHY Program Director at the end of September 2024, L’Vette\nRamsey was hired in March 2025 as the new Director.\nTo further enhance compliance oversight, a comprehensive internal compliance\nchecklist was recently developed and will be implemented by RHY leadership.\nInternal reviews will now take place twice a year to monitor licensing compliance,\nin addition to the annual CA assessment.\nProgress and corrections have been made on all violations noted in the previous\nCAP. All staff submitted their annual CPS clearance request forms in June 2025,\nand clearance results were received in July 2025. Initial treatment plans for both\nSanctuary and ASF residents are being completed by counseling staff and are\nreviewed, approved, and countersigned by supervisory staff, which may include\nthe Counseling Manager, RHY Director, or Chief Administrator.\nA structured training plan has been created through the Relias training platform to\nensure all staff meet the minimum requirement of 25 hours annually. New staff\nare receiving an additional 25–30 hours of training, including orientation and\nselected external trainings, such as courses offered through the RHYTECH\ntraining platform. Staff files are being reviewed to ensure compliance with CCI\nnew hire requirements, including verification of three references, education, TB\ntesting, fingerprinting (FBI clearance), CPS clearance, and CPR certification.\nIncident Reports are being completed and reviewed promptly. When required,\nreports are submitted to the Licensing Consultant. All incidents involving police\ncontact or staff involvement are being reported within the designated timeframes.",
    "CAP-related activities have positively impacted programming. Staff have shown\nincreased engagement in meeting training requirements. Given the high rate of\nstaff turnover, all new employees receive written documentation outlining training\nexpectations and immediate access to the Relias platform.\nThe RHY Program Manager developed a comprehensive orientation plan that\nhas been completed by all current staff and is now implemented on the first day\nof employment for new staff. This ensures all team members meet required\ntraining standards from the onset of employment.\nUnplanned discharges have been rare, with only two youth experiencing\nunplanned discharges during the reporting period.\n• The first case involved a youth who fled from school and abandoned their\ntransportation following a school suspension. The youth later contacted\nSanctuary staff, expressing stress and a desire to take a break from the\nprogram. The youth returned to retrieve personal belongings. Staff\nattempted to deescalate the situation, but the youth left on foot. Royal Oak\nPolice were contacted to initiate runaway protocol. The youth's mother\ngave police permission to transport the youth to the hospital, where she\nmet them. The mother later called The Sanctuary to express her gratitude\nfor the staff’s dedication and efforts to ensure her child’s safety.\n• The second case involved a youth who requested to leave the program\nafter being informed that eating in their bedroom was not permitted. The\nyouth contacted police, expressing frustration over chores and a desire to\ngo to the hospital. The youth's mother was contacted and chose to take\nthe youth to the hospital herself. The youth self-discharged and did not\nreturn to the program.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed expressed overall satisfaction with the program, highlighting its\nfocus on providing shelter, therapeutic services, life skills, and wellness activities\nto youth. They reported that children are respected, receive adequate therapeutic\nsupport, and generally get along well with each other. Staff emphasized the\nimportance of clear communication with youth and noted feeling supported and\nconfident in their roles, including during crisis intervention. Several staff members\nexpressed a need for more full-time staff to enhance continuity of care and\nrelationship-building. A common concern raised was the mixing of youth from the\nA Step Forward (ASF)and Basic Sanctuary Center ( BSC) programs, as each\nprogram has different structures and rules—ASF focuses on independent living\nwhile BSC is more structured. This overlap can lead to confusion and conflict\namong the youth, particularly around differing expectations such as curfew times\nand telephone usage. For example, ASF youth may have later curfews and more\nflexible phone access, while BSC youth follow stricter time constraints and limited\nphone privileges, which can cause tension or feelings of unfairness. Staff\nsuggested separating the two populations to better support their distinct needs and\nmaintain consistency in expectations.",
    "Youth interviewed from the A Step Forward program expressed overall satisfaction\nwith their experience and indicated that the program is meeting their needs. They\nreported feeling safe, well-supported by staff, and having access to adequate food.\nSeveral youth highlighted enjoying the meals, with one noting a particular interest\nin cooking. All youth confirmed participation in both group and individual therapy\nand expressed that they feel comfortable engaging in the services offered. One\nyouth mentioned an interest in transitioning into the Graduated Apartment Program\n(GAP) program and stated that they would not change anything about their current\nexperience. No concerns were raised by the youth during the interviews.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA tour of the facility occurred during the inspection on 07/31/25. The facility was\nclean and in good condition. There were no safety concerns noted during the\ninspection.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n___________________________________ 09/03/2025\nErica Marshall Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n09/03/2025\n___________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager"
