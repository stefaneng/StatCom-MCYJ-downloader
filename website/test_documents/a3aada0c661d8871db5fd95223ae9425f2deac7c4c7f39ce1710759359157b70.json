    "(ii) Of the current foster parent’s rights concerning the\nchange in placement.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Parent was not provided required notification.\nInvestigation It was alleged the foster parents of Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C\nwere not given notification by the agency of a change in\nplacement for the foster children.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Complainant 1 and Complainant 2 by telephone on\n10/18/2023. They reported the foster children had been placed in\ntheir home since May 2022. They stated they were given notice\nby the agency that the children were to be moved effective\n8/14/2023. This was confirmed with a DHS 30 document that was\nsigned 8/1/2023. They stated they appealed the decision to the\nFoster Care Review Board. The Foster Care Review Board\ndecision supported the agency's intent to move the children to\nanother foster home. Complainant 1 and Complainant 2 reported\nthey were a borrowed bed/home for the placement of these\nchildren. They reported they had a good working relationship with\ntheir certifying agency, but they had communication issues with\nthe placing agency. Complainant 1 and Complainant 2 stated the\nchildren had medical needs that they did not think other\nplacements could meet.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 by telephone on 12/6/2023.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported the children were doing well in\ntheir new placement. Foster Care Worker 1 indicated the new\nplacement is able to meet the medical needs of the children. The\nworker reported the complainants were notified as confirmed by\ndocumentation and the Foster Care Review Board findings.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\nI reviewed placement information for Youth A, Youth B, and Youth\nC in the MISACWIS information system. Documentation for the\nidentified change in placement included the completion of a DHHS\n30 notifying the foster parents of the change in placement to be\neffective 8/14/2023. The foster parent confirmed receipt of the\nnotification as they appealed to the Foster Care Review Board.\nThis notification was signed by the worker, supervisor, and foster\nparent 8/1/2023. The foster parents appealed this decision to the\nFoster Care Review Board. The Foster Care Review Board\nHearing occurred 8/11/2023. The Foster Care Review Board\n2",
    "findings dated 8/16/2023 supported the change in placement by\nthe agency. The change in placement occurred effective\n9/15/2023. The agency received permission/approval for the\nchange in placement from MCI 9/6/2023. The children were\nsubsequently moved 9/15/2023 and the documentation for this\nmove included the DHS 69, Foster Care/Juvenile Justice Action\nSummary forms for each child that were completed 9/14/2023.\nAdditional documentation included Family Team Meetings (FTM’s)\nthat were completed 8/22/2023 and 11/20/2023.
