Turning right at the top of the stairs\nleads you into the large living room with a large window. At the end of the living room is\na doorway leading to the third bedroom which is also set up for two youth. Turning left\nafter entering the living room you enter the dining room which has the back door on the\noutside wall. Facing the dining room, you have a doorway in the right wall that leads to\nthe office. Turing to the left you have the large entrance to the kitchen.

    "history of abuse/neglect, mental/emotional instability, parent abandonment, a need to\ndevelop skills for independent living, history of mild substance abuse (only marijuana),\nminimal behavioral issues (minimal aggression), at least 30 days without being\nphysically restrained, difficulty establishing healthy relationships, and/or a history of\nsexual abuse is acceptable with at least one year since last assault with no pending\ncriminal sexual misconduct charges or pending allegations.

The program will provide an average length of stay between six and nine\nmonths with general outcome goals of family reunification, entrance into independent\nliving or adoption, if applicable. Pine Way Group South will provide supervision for\nresident 24/7. Because the residents will attend public schooling, the staff will supervise\nyouth during school hours by monitoring youth attendance at school (absences and\ntardiness) while making themselves available for any need that arises at the school\nsetting. This program does not use physical restraint with youth.\nThe program will provide treatment planning with a variety of treatment services.\nPsychiatric Services will include consultation (Psychiatric services will be contracted\noutside the facility) and psychotropic medication management. Services to be provided\nto each youth include individual therapy, group therapy, family therapy, and other\ncommunity outreach services if determined necessary and part of the youth’s treatment\nplan. Treatment provided through the program involves the Trauma Focused Cognitive\nBehavioral Therapy (TFCBT) modality. Educational services will be provided to support\nthe youth’s educational goals and each youth will be enrolled in a local academic\nprogram that best suits their individual needs. Additional services include tutoring,\nadvocacy at IEP meetings and coordination of all meetings, mentoring, and athletic\nparticipation. Pine Way Group will also focus heavily on assisting the youth with\nacquiring and developing independent living skills. Various topics presented to the youth\nwill include substance abuse education, health education (hygiene and sexual choices),\nmoney management, public transportation, meal planning/cooking, employment\ntraining, and secondary educational goals. These skills are developed and practiced\nthrough group sessions, phase booklets, individual therapy, and/or community outings.\nAll youth will be scheduled for and transported to medical appointments, dental\nappointments, psychiatric assessments and medication reviews.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThere were no Rule violations found.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend issuance of an original license to this Therapeutic Child Caring\nInstitution, private.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
