DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules.\nCPA Rule 400.12303 Financial Stability\n(1) An agency shall demonstrate sufficient financing,\non an ongoing basis, to ensure the agency is carrying\nout its programs and meeting the requirements for\nlicensing. A plan of financing must include all the\nfollowing:\n(e) An audit of all financial accounts conducted\nannually by an independent certified public\naccountant not administratively related to the agency.\nA copy of the audit shall be available to the\ndepartment upon request.\nThe agency did not have an independent financial audit completed for 2024.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n10/1/24 Interim, CAP approved 11/6/24\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Financial Audit: The agency made a good faith effort to complete an audit as\nrequired, but there was a misunderstanding with the certified public\naccountant of what was required. The agency had a Compilation Report\ncompleted by their certified public accountant for 2023 and 2024. The agency\nreported they were advised by their accountant that this Compilation report\nwould meet the audit requirement. However, upon review of the report, it\nspecifically stated that an “audit” was not completed. The agency was advised",
    "that an audit was required and should include statement of financial position,\nactivities, functional expenses, and cash flow.\n• Adoption Applications: The agency was reminded to ensure that applicants\nsign and date their Orientation and Application with the correct dates.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request or require consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\n10/1/24 Interim, CAP approved 11/6/24: The agency was cited regarding Rule\n203, as an annual financial audit had not been completed. The agency indicated\nthey successfully implemented their CAP as they submitted a document from their\naccountant for 2023 and 2024. However, the document was reviewed and found\nto be a Compilation Report, not an audit. Therefore, a repeat violation was found\nand the agency is required to submit a CAP. The agency is now aware of what is\nrequired for a financial audit to meet the rule requirement.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment dated 9/29/25 was reviewed and discussed.\nThe agency did not identify any needs or systemic issues. There was one\ndisrupted placement during this review period, for a child that was placed in a pre-\nadoptive home for six months. The adoptive parents chose not to finalize the\nadoption, without explanation.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided their 2025 budget, as well as a Compilation Report from their\naccountant for 2023 and 2024. No concerns were noted. However, the agency did\nnot submit an annual audit completed by their accountant, as required by the rules\nand reflected in the citation of rule 400.12303 (1)(e).\nStaff Interviews\nTwo adoption staff were interviewed. Both had been with the agency for over one\nyear. Staff reported they enjoyed their positions and working with families and\nchildren. Staff stated their caseloads are manageable, Administration is easy to\ncommunicate with and open to feedback, and flexibility in their schedule is",
    "something they really appreciate. Staff did not report any concerns regarding the\nagency or their supervisor.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as previous years. The\nbuilding has sufficient space for staff to work and meet with clients. Files and\nconfidential information are kept in locked storage cabinets. Closed adoption files\nare kept in a separate locked cabinet in the basement of the building.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis agency is not contracted with MDHHS to provide foster care placement or\ncertification services, therefore this is not applicable.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes. A corrective action plan is required.\n_ ____________September 30, 2025______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 1, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
