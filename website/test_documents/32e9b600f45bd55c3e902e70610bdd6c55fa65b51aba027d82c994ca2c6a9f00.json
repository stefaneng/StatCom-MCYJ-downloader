    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection • (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family\nDescription time for each child in foster care consistent with the child's\nservice plans, as required by R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420 to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Parenting time is being cancelled by the agency due to staffing\nissues and the time is not being made up.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on October 3,\n2024. There was no additional information provided.\nBiological Mother was interviewed via telephone on October\n3, 2024. She stated she has supervised visitation with her two\nchildren. It is supposed to be three times per week for two hours\neach visit. There is also an option for a relative to supervise an\nadditional visit each week. Her mother was supervising a visit\neach week at one point but this is no longer occurring. She\nbelieves the agency has discretion to change the visitation to\nunsupervised. She stated she doesn’t recall visitation\nrequirements being specified during any of the recent court\nhearings. There was a parenting time agreement drafted in April\n2024 that included the visitation schedule were on Monday’s,\nWednesday’s, Friday’s and a relative supervised on Sunday’s by\nmutual agreement. She doesn’t recall the agency providing an\nupdated parenting time agreement since the one dated April 2024.\nShe stated there have been several occurrences where her\nparenting time was cancelled for various reasons. She stated this\nhas been a pattern and is not something that recently started. She\nstated she has text messages to verify this as well. A few months\nago, the agency took away her scheduled parenting time on\nMonday’s due to staffing issues. Her visit was cancelled and there\nwas no plan to make up the lost time. She stated the agency does\nnot make alternative arrangements to make up the time she lost\ndue to the agency cancelling. She stated the agency will say they\nowe her time, but it is never made up.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nOctober 14, 2024. She stated she has been the assigned worker\n2",
    "since May 2024. When she was assigned to the case, she was\nnotified parenting time is three times per week. It was four times\nper week at one point, but the relative Caregiver stopped\nsupervising visitations due to some conflicts between her and\nBiological Mother.\nMonday visits ended right around Labor Day due to staffing issues\nbut have recently started up again due to staff availability.\nBiological Mother was informed a few weeks ago that Mondays\nare covered starting 10/7/24, however Biological Mother has new\nemployment, and this day no longer works for her schedule. The\nvisits have been two days per week, approximately two to two and\na half hours per visit. FCW stated Biological Mother is still having\nsupervised visits for 4 hours per week. She informed her she\nwould attempt to speak with relative Caregiver to see if she would\nbe willing to supervise an additional visit each week.\nFCW stated the agency has visitation specialists who supervise\nthe majority of the parenting time. They try to be consistent for\neach case. The specialist for Wednesday and Friday has\nmaintained the visits but the assigned worker on Mondays was no\nlonger able to supervise visits that day due to school obligations.\nFCW stated she usually steps in if the visitation specialist isn’t\navailable, however she was out of the office for a significant\namount of time in September and wasn’t able to find another\nworker to cover.\nFCW stated the court doesn’t specify the time or frequency of\nparenting time. They only specify supervised by agency or\ndesignee and unsupervised visits needs to be consulted by\nchildren’s GAL. FCW stated the court was notified the amount of\nparenting time Biological Mother is given and were happy with the\nagency’s effort. She stated the agency goes above and beyond\noffering additional parenting time on their cases. She stated\nBiological Mother receives the most parenting time on any of their\ncases.\nIf parenting time is missed the agency attempts to make up the\nmissed time. In the summer it was easier to make up missed\nparenting time but adding to scheduled visits. Due to school being\nin session, it has become more challenging to make up lost time.\nThe agency is planning to start doing longer day visits.\nUnsupervised visits were occurring but stopped due to a positive\ndrug screen. Biological Mother was told that would start up again\nafter a reporting period with just her medication showing in drug\n3",
    "screen results. FCW stated in a few weeks it will be a full reporting\nperiod.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FC Supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on October 15, 2024. She stated the court has not\nspecified an amount of parenting time. The agency has attempted\nto be expansive with the number of hours that are provided to\nBiological Mother. At one point during the summer, the agency\nwas providing Biological Mother with six hours of supervised\nparenting time along with a few hours of parenting time with\nCaregiver supervising. Caregiver is no longer supervising due to a\nconflict with Biological Mother.\nThe parenting time agreement from April 2024 outlined the\namount of parenting time the agency will provide to Biological\nMother. That form is provided so everyone is on the same page\nwith the visitation schedule. If, for whatever reason, a scheduled\nparenting time is cancelled the agency keeps track of any time\nthat may be owed to a parent and then a plan is made to make up\nthe time. Regarding Biological Mother, FC Supervisor stated she\nhas already spoken with FCW to determine how they will make up\nparenting time owed to Biological Mother. FC Supervisor stated\ncoordinating a parenting time schedule can be challenging due to\nBiological Mother’s schedule, along with the children and\nCaregiver’s schedule.\nFC Supervisor acknowledged the agency has experienced some\nstaffing challenges and the month of September was extremely\nchallenging for the agency regarding staffing. She clarified\nBiological Mother has never received less than 4 hours of\nparenting time per week. The agency has hired additional staff\nand now have a plan in place moving forward to provide the\nparenting time outlined in the parenting time agreement. The plan\nis to move toward unsupervised parenting time in November 2024.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• 4/26/2024 (signed by FCW and Biological Mother)\nparenting time agreement states “your current visit\nschedule between you and your children is Monday,\nWednesday, Friday and relative supervised Sundays by\nmutual agreement. Effective date is 4/19/24.\n• 6/25/2024 & 9/16/2024 court order states parenting time is\nsupervised by MDHHS or its designee. The agency has\ndiscretion for unsupervised visits if LGAL agrees. Court\norder does not state the minimum amount of parenting time\nper week.\n4",
