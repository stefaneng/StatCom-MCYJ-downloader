Former Staff 1 put\nhim in a bearhug implying improper restraint. Former Staff 1 put Youth J outside\nwhere he stayed for three hours implying inappropriate discipline.\n2",
    "INVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Youth J, age 15, jointly with Government Worker 1. He has been at\nthe facility for just five days. Youth J said he has ADHD and mentioned he likes to\n“fight/box.” He was hyperverbal and blended his words together. His thoughts were\ndisorganized, and he was unable to present information in chronological order.\nOn 7/11/21, Youth J said he and another youth were held back from an outing due to\ntheir behavior. When his peers returned from the outing, he said “Two kids hit me. I\nwas bumping my back against the wall for no reason.” Former Staff 1 redirected the\nboys. “She (Former Staff 1) told me if I wanted to do that, I could leave and\nthreatened to put me out. She bearhugged me. I flipped the couch. She lifted me\nup and put me outside.” Asked to clarify, Youth J claimed Former Staff 1 physically\nlifted him up off the floor, walked with him out the exit door and set him outside on\nhis feet.\nWhile outdoors, Youth J said Supervisor 1 talked to him “for a long time.” They\nwaited for Former Staff 1 to get off work and Supervisor 1 let him back into the\ncottage.\nAfter being “put out” of his cottage, initially Youth J admitted he never attempted to\nget back inside because he knew he would not be let in. Then he changed his story,\nstating he repeatedly knocked on the door trying to get in. At this point of the\ninterview, Youth J mumbled, “I’m a liar and a thief.”\nFormer Staff 1 no longer works at the facility. According to Director 1, she had no\ndisciplinary record. Former Staff 1 worked at Methodist for eight months and\nresigned on 7/12/21. I interviewed Former Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1\nvia telephone. She told us she never intended to resign but was asked to sign a\nresignation letter after she complained to Human Resources that she “did not feel\nvalued as an employee.” Former Staff 1 said her resignation was unrelated to the\nincident under investigation in this report.\nFormer Staff 1 was asked to recall the afternoon of 7/11/21. She said Youth J was\ndisruptive to peers, physically destructive and verbally abusive to staff. Youth J left\nthe cottage without permission at 3pm, Staff 2 intervened, Youth J returned,\napologized, and picked up the mess he had made. After that, Former Staff 1 said “I\nsat with Youth J for hours. He was fine until his peers returned from an outing with\nSubway (fast food). Youth J had already eaten and was upset.” Former Staff 1 said\nshe explained to him that the fast food was a treat that came with the privilege of\nqualifying for the outing.\nLater during shower time (7 – 7:30pm), Former Staff 1 said Youth J was “teasing\nand agitating” his peers. Staff tried to redirect him. Youth J banged on a peer’s door\n3",
    "and “cursed me.” Staff 2 directed him to his room. “Youth J ran around, flipping\ncouches and jumped the counter onto chairs…We tried to ignore some of the\nbehaviors. He walked into my personal space calling me the ‘N’ and ‘B’ words.”\nFormer Staff 1 suggested Youth J go outdoors to cool down. “He asked for his\nshoes and threw them at the door. I left the area. When I returned, he had gone\noutside to the playscape. We (Former Staff 1 and Staff 2) watched him from the\nwindow. He returned with the hose on and started spraying the building with water.\nHe did not respond to redirection. He threatened to tell his worker I abused him. I\nwent outside and asked if he wanted to come inside. He said ‘No’ and that he would\ntell his worker I made him stay outside. I told him to let us know when he wanted to\ncome back in. He told Supervisor 1 that I abused him. Supervisor 1 talked to him\noutside until about 9pm.” Former Staff 1 said she was working at 9:30pm when\nYouth J returned with the supervisor, showered, and went to bed.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has worked at the facility\nfor five months and has 13 years of experience working in a secure child caring\ninstitution. Staff 2 told us he had not received CPI training at Methodist since he\nwas hired in Feb 2021. Rather than physically intervene with youth, Staff 2 said they\ncall the police if youth require physical intervention. I checked Staff 2’s Orientation\nTraining record. It showed 1.75 hrs. of CPI training and 2.0 hrs. of child discipline\ntraining. (See additional finding)\nStaff 2 said he worked with Former Staff 1 on 7/11/21. When five youth and one\nstaff returned from an outing, he said Youth J started agitating a peer, flipped the\nfurniture and became verbally abusive toward Former Staff 1. Former Staff 1\nsuggested he go outdoors for a walk. “She escorted him toward the door, got his\nshoes and he went outside.”\nStaff 2 said he stood in the cottage doorway and watched Youth J while he was\noutside. Youth J started destroying property. “I redirected him and disconnected the\nwater hose. He was banging on the cottage door and windows. It got to raining\nhard. He walked to the playscape. He stayed outside for 30 or 40 minutes. Staff 2\ntended showers inside the cottage while Supervisor 1 talked to Youth J outside.\nStaff 2 said Former Staff 1 never put Youth J in a “bearhug” or small-child restraint.\nShe also did not physically lift him off the floor and “put” him outside. Staff 2 said\nYouth J left the cottage on his own and never asked to come back in until he\nreturned with Supervisor 1.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has worked at\nMethodist for one year and is a CPI instructor. Around 9:30pm, Supervisor 1 said he\nwas in his office when he saw Youth J outdoors trying to break a window in the\nadministrative building. Former Staff 1 was outdoors monitoring the youth from a\ndistance. Supervisor 1 sat down with Youth J and had a conversation outside.\n4",
    "During their talk, Supervisor 1 said the youth never told him that Former Staff 1\nrestrained or disciplined him inappropriately. “He (Youth J) vented and then wanted\nto go back to his cottage.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand procedures regarding restraint. These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their families,\nand referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: Based on the interviews, there is no evidence Former Staff 1\nphysically managed or restricted Youth J’s movement in any\nway. There is also no evidence Former Staff 1 lifted Youth J off\nthe floor and physically placed him outside.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(h) Denial of shelter, clothing, or essential personal\nneeds.\nANALYSIS: On the night of 7/11/21, it was determined Youth J left his\ncottage voluntarily after Former Staff 1 suggested he go\noutdoors to calm down. The youth engaged in destructive\nbehaviors both inside and outside the cottage. He eventually\nsettled down while talking with a supervisor. There was no\nevidence any staff “put” him out or denied him access back into\nthe cottage.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nStaff 2 is a youth specialist hired in Feb 2021. His Orientation Training record\nindicates he has 1.75 hrs. - CPI training and 2.0 hrs. - child discipline training. There\n5",
    "was no record he is CPI certified or had any additional physical management\ntraining since February.\nThe facility’s residential policy section F.9 indicates “The CPI model has ten (10)\nunits which are taught over a two (2) day period to all youth specialists.” Staff 2 did\nnot have the two-day CPI training written in the agency’s physical\nmanagement/restraint training policy.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nRule 2. Prohibition of Prone Restraint; Procedures Involving Other\nRestraints in Child Caring Institutions\nThe written policy must include all of the following:\n(f) Procedures for the provision of sufficient and adequate\ntraining for all staff members of the CCI who may use or\norder the use of restraint using the CCI’s written\nprocedures.\nANALYSIS: The agency’s policy pertaining to CPI training indicates there\nare ten modules taught to all youth specialists over a two-day\nperiod. Staff 2 was hired in Feb 2021 and as of July 2021, he\nhad not had two days of CPI training.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe staff training model that utilizes CPI techniques for physical\nrestraint & TCI techniques for verbal de-escalation was\napproved by the department in 2017. The approved model and\ntechniques should reflect the agency’s current practice and be\nconsistent with the agency’s written policies. If the agency\nwishes to change their crisis intervention techniques and/or staff\ntraining model, this must first be approved by the\ndepartment.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nStaff 2 stated that Staff 3 took five youth on an outing to the movies on 7/11/21 and\nDirector 1 confirmed this.\nMethodist contracts with DHHS for treatment and shelter beds. Both contracts\nrequire a staff-to-youth ratio of 1 staff for every 4 youth. The facility was out of ratio\non 7/11/21 when Staff 3 took five youth off the grounds on an outing.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nRFCAN/RFCJJ 1. General Residential\nStaffing Ratio\nThe Contractor must:\na. Provide a minimum of one on-duty direct care worker for\nevery four youth during waking hours.\nANALYSIS: The agency’s contract indicates they are required to have a 1:4\nratio and they were out of ratio on 7/11/21.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its Regular License.\nJuly 22, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 29, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
