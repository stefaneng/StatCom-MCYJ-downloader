    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4129 Institutions serving developmentally\nSection disabled youth; written procedures.\nDescription (1) An institution providing care to developmentally disabled\nresidents shall require staff to follow written procedures for\nbathing, feeding, toilet training, and daily activities of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff won't check youth’s brief before they go to bed. Staff has\nsaid to just let the overnight staff worry about it. This has\nhappened on several occasions.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 3/4/24.\nComplainant reported she received the complaint from an\nanonymous source and did not have any contact information for\nthe person who made the complaint. Complainant reported there\nwere no youth or staff names associated to this allegation. Since\nthe original complaint source was anonymous and no contact\ninformation was provided, no further details could be requested.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at a\ndifferent facility on 3/5/24, at this facility on 3/15/24, and via\nphone on 4/10/24. CA reported it is obvious when a youth has\nsoiled their briefs, and she hasn’t heard about or received\ncomplaints about any staff neglecting to change a youth’s briefs\nbefore they go to bed. CA reported Youth A and Youth C are the\ntwo youth at the facility who wear briefs. Youth A always wears\nbriefs and Youth C only wears briefs at night. CA reported\nbecause the youth are teenagers, it is not appropriate for staff to\nrandomly checking youth’s briefs as a standard practice. However,\neach youth in briefs has an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) plan\nand/or a bathroom protocol. Part of each youth’s ADL is to take\nthem to the bathroom before bed, and it is expected staff would\nchange a youth’s brief at that time. CA reported all staff receive\non-going training and feedback about bathroom protocols and\nADLs from BCBA (Board-Certified Behavior Analyst) staff during\nfrequent observations of staff & youth interactions and data\ncollection throughout their employment.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/5/24.\nStaff 1 reported Youth C is non-verbal, but when he has\naccidents, he gets up quickly and let’s staff know because he\ndoesn’t like the feeling. Staff 1 reported Youth A can say\n“bathroom” or expresses in another way if he has an accident.\nStaff 1 reported both youths have bathroom protocols and ADL\n2",
    "plans, which requires them to use the bathroom prior to going to\nbed. If staff notice they have soiled themselves prior to bed, it\nwould be the responsibility of those staff to change their briefs at\nthat time. Staff 1 reported she has not witnessed or heard of any\nconcerns regarding staff not following these protocols or not\naddressing any youth’s bathroom needs.\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 were interviewed face to face at the facility\non 3/5/24. Both staff reported all youth, including Youth A and\nYouth C, do their ADL plans right before bed, so if they have a\nsoiled brief, it gets changed then. Both staff reported Youth A and\nYouth C are supposed to be taken to the bathroom every hour\nduring waking hours and if they were soiled, they would be\ncleaned up and their brief would be changed. Both staff reported\nthey have never witnessed or heard of those duties get pushed\nonto another shift or a youth’s bathroom needs going\nunaddressed.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/15/24.\nStaff 5 reported the same information as Staff 2 and Staff 3. Staff\n5 also reported there are times third shift staff have had to help\nwith ADL plans if second shift is running behind, but it only\nhappens if there’s an escalated youth or they’re short staffed. Staff\n5 reported it hasn’t happened often or consistently, and if it\nhappens, it is always communicated in an appropriate way rather\nthan being pushed off to third shift.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/15/24.\nStaff 6 reported she has never heard of or witnessed any staff\nintentionally leave youth soiled, not address their ADL plan,\nneglect a youth’s bathroom needs, or leave a youth’s soiled brief\nfor third shift to handle.\nStudent 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n3/15/24. Student 1 reported she is part of the clinical staff, and\nthey do frequent observations of ADL plans. Student 1 reported as\npart of those observations, she has never seen any staff disregard\na youth’s bathroom needs. Student 1 reported she has never\nwitnessed or heard of any staff leaving a youth’s bathroom needs\nfor another shift to handle.\nYouth A and Youth C are non-verbal and were unable to be\ninterviewed.\n3",
    "DOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• ADL (Activities of Daily Living) Policy states these plans\ninclude information on a youth’s bathing, toileting, feeding,\nand other individually identified needs. Assistance will be\nprovided by support and assessment, training, and/or\nongoing support. Staff are to follow the steps as described\nin the plan.\n• Youth A’s Bathroom Protocol dated 8/9/23 states Youth A\nshould be using the bathroom once every hour during\nwaking hours and staff should record bathroom trips on\ndaily data sheets.\n• Youth A’s January 2024 daily logs do not reflect any\nconcerns about staff not changing youth’s brief as required.\n• Youth C’s Bathroom Protocol dated 3/22/23 states staff\nshould place any soiled clothing items in a nearby laundry\nhamper to be washed. Youth C should wear underwear\nwhile at home. At the facility, Youth C will be prompted to\ngo to the bathroom every 30 minutes during waking hours.\nIf Youth C independently asks to use the bathroom, staff\nwill immediately stop the current activity/demand and take\nhim to the bathroom. Youth C must sit on the toilet for 5\nminutes. All data must be entered on a data sheet for every\nscheduled sit, self-initiation, and accident.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. No employees had any concerns with\nstaff not checking any youth’s briefs before bed or leaving a\nyouth’s bathroom needs for another shift to handle.\nDocumentation for the youth who wear briefs do not note any\nconcerns for this occurring.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff used blocking pads to push youth into their room.\n4",
    "Investigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 3/4/24.\nComplainant reported she received the complaint from an\nanonymous source and did not have any contact information for\nthe person who made the complaint. Complainant reported this\nallegation was specific to Youth A, but there were no staff names\nprovided with the allegation. Since the original complaint source\nwas anonymous and no contact information was provided, no\nfurther details could be requested.\nStaff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 were interviewed face to face\nseparately at the facility on 3/5/24. Staff 5, Staff 6, Student 1\nand Student 2 were interviewed face to face separately at the\nfacility on 3/15/24. They all reported they have never seen or\nheard of any staff using a blocking pad to push Youth A into his\nroom. They all reported Youth A loves being in his room, so they\ncould not think of any situation in which someone would have to\nforce him into his room. They all reported the use of force with a\nblocking pad is prohibited, and if they would have seen this occur,\nthey would have reported it.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at a\ndifferent facility on 3/5/24, at this facility on 3/15/24, and via\nphone on 4/10/24. CA reported blocking pads would be used if a\nyouth was being aggressive towards staff but shouldn’t ever be\nutilized to push a youth. CA reported she has never seen or heard\nof any staff utilizing blocking pads to push Youth A into his room.\nYouth A was unable to be interviewed because he is non-\nverbal.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Youth A case file documents Youth A has resided at this\nfacility since 1/23/24.\n• Blocking Pad Procedures outlines when and how to utilize\nblocking pads at the facility. It outlines what are appropriate\ntechniques when using the blocking pads. It says pushing,\nstriking, or shoving of someone with the pad is not allowed.\n• Great Lakes Center for Autism Treatment and Researched\nLicensed Settings Policy Regarding Discipline and\nBehavior Management states pushing a youth on any part\nof their body is prohibited.\n5",
    "Analysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. All employees interviewed reported\nthey have never seen or heard of any staff using a blocking pad to\npush Youth A into his room.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation One youth is fearful of staff, and this same staff ignores\nBehavioral Support Plans (BSP's).\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 3/4/24.\nComplainant reported she received the complaint from an\nanonymous source and did not have any contact information for\nthe person who made the complaint. Complainant reported this\nallegation only provided a last name for a youth, but not the first\nname. Complainant reported there were no staff names provided\nwith the allegation. Since the original complaint source was\nanonymous and no contact information was provided, no further\ndetails could be requested.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were interviewed face to face separately at\nthe facility on 3/5/24. Both staff stated they have never known\nYouth B to be fearful of any staff at the facility. Both reported\nYouth B has never complained, stated he was fearful, or reacted\nin a way to make them think he was fearful of a staff at the facility.\nBoth reported they have no knowledge of any staff intentionally\nignoring Youth B’s BSP. Both reported there are times when staff\nmay forget little pieces of a BSP, but they’re honest mistakes, and\nnothing that would be harmful towards a youth.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/5/24.\nStaff 3 reported she has never seen or heard of Youth B being\nfearful of any staff. Staff 3 reported he demonstrates and\nexpresses fear towards other youth if they become aggressive,\nbut not staff. Staff 3 reported she has never seen or heard of\nanyone blatantly ignoring Youth B’s BSP. Staff 3 reported one part\nof Youth B’s BSP is to watchfully ignore his problem behaviors.\nStaff 3 reported she can see how a staff may make an honest\n6",
    "mistake in not following it or someone might have seen a staff\nignoring Youth B’s behaviors and misinterpreted the situation.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at a different facility on\n3/7/24. Staff 4 reported he worked at this facility from November\n2023 until mid-January 2024. Staff 4 reported he never saw or\nheard of Youth B demonstrating or expressing any fear towards\nhim or any other staff at the facility. Staff 4 reported he has never\nseen any staff blatantly or intentionally ignore Youth B’s BSP.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/15/24.\nStaff 5 reported she has never known Youth B to be fearful of any\nstaff at the facility. Staff 5 reported some days he just likes some\nstaff more than others. Staff 5 reported there are times Youth B\nexpresses he is happy certain staff aren’t working, but there’s no\nconsistency to which staff he picks each time. Staff 5 reported she\nhasn’t seen or heard of any staff intentionally or blatantly not\nfollowing Youth B’s BSP.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/15/24.\nStaff 6 reported she has never seen or heard of Youth B showing\nor expressing fear towards any staff. Staff 6 reported she has not\nseen or heard of any staff ignoring Youth B’s BSP. Staff 6\nreported Youth B has a little bag with a timer that goes off every 7\nminutes. If he has had good behaviors after the timer going off 4\ntimes, Youth B will get a candy as a prize. Staff 6 reported there\nare times when the timer or prize gets missed by staff sometimes,\nbut this is not a consistent practice by any staff. Staff 6 reported\nit’s not intentional when it happens because sometimes staff just\nforget because it is busy, or they are focused on other things.\nStudent 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n3/15/24. Student 1 reported she has never seen Youth B\ndemonstrate or express fear towards any staff. Student 1 reported\nthere are times when various staff negate some small nit-picky\ncomponents of his BSP, but nothing regarding the well-being\ncomponent of his BSP. Student 1 reported Staff 7 disagreed with\nsome small components of Youth B’s BSP, and the clinical team\nfrequently received negative feedback from Staff 7. Student 1\nreported Staff 7 didn’t do anything rising to the level of a recipient\nrights complaint. Student 1 reported the relationship between Staff\n7 and Youth B was different, but Staff 7 didn’t do anything to make\nit that way. Student 1 reported there were times Youth B would\nrepeat “[Staff 7’s] not here” in a loud tone, and normally Youth B is\nlouder about things he has anxiety about. Student 1 reported\nwhen Youth B would engage in targeted or aggressive behavior, it\n7",
    "was typically towards Staff 7. However, Student 1 noted there are\nnot a lot of male staff at the facility, so that could have been a\nreason for Youth B’s behaviors towards Staff 7.\nStudent 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n3/15/24. Student 2 reported she has never seen Youth B\ndemonstrate or express fear towards any staff. Student 2 reported\nYouth B had a different relationship with Staff 7, but she isn’t sure\nit was a lack of trust, dislike, or something else. Student 2 reported\nYouth B would aggress towards Staff 7 more than anyone else.\nStudent 2 reported even after Staff 7 hadn’t worked at the facility\nfor a month, Youth B would still fixate on repeating “[Staff 7’s] not\nhere” or “Is [Staff 7] coming?”, which is a symptom of his\ndiagnosis. Student 2 reported it was clear Staff 7 cared about the\nyouth at the facility, but it was difficult to work with him because it\nwas obvious, he didn’t care as much about the BSPs. Student 2\nreported Staff 7 treated the BSPs as a choice and not something\nhe had to run each shift. Student 2 reported when she would\nprovide Staff 7 with feedback, he would become frustrated and\nsay, “it’s easier for me to do it this way”. Student 2 reported she\nwould frequently have to remind Staff 7 the BSP was a legal\ndocument and needed to be run correctly. Student 2 reported Staff\n7 would comply with the most important parts of the BSP, which\nwere the well-being portions of Youth B’s BSP. However, Staff 7\nwould struggle to consistently implement the behavior reduction\nportions, transition warnings and proactive strategies of Youth B’s\nBSP. Student 2 reported Staff 7’s feelings or actions regarding not\nfollowing the BSP would not rise to the level of a recipient rights\nworthy complaint or be considered harmful to Youth B.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed face to face at\nanother facility on 3/7/24. PM reported Youth B is very\nexpressive and very anxious. PM reported around mid-January\n2024, he received concerns from Staff 3 about observations she\nhad regarding Staff 4’s interactions with Youth B. Staff 3 reported\nStaff 4 appeared frustrated by Youth B’s constant questions and\nbehaviors. PM reported no one knows Youth B’s BSP better than\nYouth B and it takes him a while to build rapport with staff. PM\nreported they didn’t feel that it rose to the level of a recipient rights\nviolation, but they did provide Staff 4 with feedback within his\nperformance evaluation.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at a\ndifferent facility on 3/5/24 and at this facility on 3/15/24. CA\nreported Youth B’s last name matches the Complainant’s\ninformation. CA reported some of Youth B’s scripting behaviors\n8",
    "can possibly be seen as fearful. CA reported it’s in his BSP to\nignore some of these behaviors because the more you talk to him\nabout his past trauma, it’ll escalate him further. CA reported if the\ncomplainant wasn’t familiar with his BSP, they might think staff\nwere just generally ignoring him. CA reported she hasn’t seen or\nheard of Youth B expressing or demonstrating any fear towards\nany staff. When asked about Staff 7, CA reported he was having\nsome performance issues, which consisted of mainly bumping\nheads with Staff 3. CA reported Staff 7 was disciplined for not\nfollowing BSPs for youth and not documenting program data. CA\nreported it is unreasonable to say staff are supposed to run a\nyouth’s BSP 100% of the time, so goals for all BSPs are expected\nto be 80% implementation or higher. CA reported Staff 7 was\nnever in blatant disregard of Youth B’s BSP, but it was clear he\ndidn’t value the BSPs and had a hard time understanding how the\nBSPs helped youth improve their skills and behaviors. CA\nreported Staff 7 felt youth should be making more progress at a\nfaster pace than they were, but he didn’t always document data to\nshow progress was being made. CA reported Staff 7’s non-\ncompliances with the BSP were never neglectful to any youth,\ncaused harm to any youth, etc.\nAn attempt was made to interview Youth B face to face at the\nfacility on 3/15/24. Due to Youth B’s diagnoses and abilities,\nYouth B was unable to answer any questions, and only repeated\nback everything this Consultant was asking.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Youth B case file noted he has been at the facility since\n4/17/23.\n• Youth B’s Behavior Treatment Plan (a.k.a. BSP) (updated\n7/11/23) outlines Youth B’s history, diagnoses,\nmedications, assessed behaviors, target behaviors,\nmonitored behaviors, proactive strategies, reactive\nstrategies, restrictive activities, and data/documentation\nrequired.\n• Great Lakes Center for Autism Treatment and Researched\nLicensed Settings Policy Regarding Discipline and\nBehavior Management states each youth will have a\nbehavior treatment plan developed that addresses how\nstaff are to respond to that individual’s target behavior.\nWhen a youth demonstrates a behavior not accounted for\nin the plan, or when the prescribed response cannot be\nimplemented, staff will be required to use their discretion as\n9",
    "to how to respond to the behavior. The policy outlines\nappropriate responses that could be used in these\nsituations.\n• Staff 4 has one disciplinary action in his employee file,\nunrelated to this investigation. Staff 4 received training on\nthe discipline/behavior management policy during new hire\norientation in August 2023 and was trained on Youth B’s\nBSP on 11/14/23.\n• Staff 7 has one disciplinary action in his employee file,\nunrelated to this investigation. Staff 7 received training on\nthe discipline/behavior management policy during new hire\norientation in October 2020 and was trained on Youth B’s\nBSP in May 2023.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. No staff interviewed expressed any\nconcerns about Youth B being afraid of any staff. Student 1,\nStudent 2, and CA reported Staff 7 would express his dislike for\nBSPs, not understand BSPs, or not follow some of the\nprompts/rewards/etc. for Youth B’s BSP. However, they all\nreported Staff 7 never ignored the main components of Youth B’s\nBSP or did anything that would be considered harmful or a\nrecipient’s rights violation towards Youth B.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 11, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 17, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
