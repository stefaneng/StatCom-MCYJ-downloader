Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nOn 2/28/21, adult at the facility grabbed youth and pushed youth into the wall when\nyouth was trying to run down the hall. Youth has a few carpet burns from the fall on\nforearms and knees.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 3/1/2021 I received the allegation that Youth A was grabbed and pushed to a\nwall by Staff 1 as Youth A was running down the hall. Youth A had carpet burns on\nhis forearms and knees. Additionally, the allegation indicated that the Complainant\nhad reviewed video footage of the incident and it appeared that Staff 1 did not push\nYouth A, rather Youth A was “unintentionally tripped.”\nINTERVIEWS\nDHHS Worker 1 and I made an unannounced visit to the facility at 12:00PM on\n3/1/21. We met with the Director of Quality and Risk with whom we reviewed the\nvideo footage of the event and discussed a safety plan requiring Staff 1 to not have\ncontact with Youth A until the resolution of the investigation.\nYouth A - DHHS Worker 1 and I interviewed Youth A in person. Youth A reported\nthat he and Youth B do not get along and they had gotten into an argument on\n2/27/21 that resulted in Youth A being physically restrained. Youth A reported that\nthe following day, 2/28/21, Youth A was hitting, punching, and choking Staff 1. He\nstated that he attempted to run down the hallway where Youth B’s room is located.\nYouth A stated that Youth B had said he wanted to talk to Staff 1 earlier, so Youth A\nwas running to his room to tell him that Staff 1 couldn’t talk to him because he was\nbusy with Youth A. Youth A stated that he did not tell Staff 1 his intention when he\nstarted to run but reported that he is not supposed to go down Youth B’s hallway and\nwill typically do so to make staff mad. Youth A reported that, as he was running\ndown the hall, Staff 1 ran after him and attempted to get in front of him. Youth A\nreported that, as he was running, he tripped causing his knee to hit against a wall.\nHe stated that, at the time, he thought Staff 1 tripped him on purpose, but he thought\nabout it and realized that his foot hit a chair which caused him to trip and fall. He\nstated that Staff 1 never physically came in contact with him as they were running\nand denied having any injuries as a result of the fall. He reported that he feels safe\nat the facility and has no concerns with staff.\n3",
    "On 3/2/21 DHHS Worker 1 and I made a scheduled visit to the facility at 1:30pm to\ninterview Staff 1 and Staff 2. Director of Quality and Risk was present during the\ninterviews.\nStaff 1 - Staff 1 reported that on 2/8/21. Youth A had been escalated for\napproximately an hour during which he was hitting, kicking, and choking Staff 1. He\nstated that Youth A was not responding to de-escalation attempts and Staff 1 was\ntrying to keep Youth A’s focus on him so he wouldn’t direct his aggression toward\nother staff or youth in the home. Youth A attempted to run down Youth B’s hallway\nand since he had an altercation with Youth B earlier in the day, Staff 1 reported\nfeeling that he had to prevent Youth A from getting to Youth B’s room in order to\nkeep Youth B safe. Staff 1 stated that he perceives himself as a quick person, so he\nthought he could run faster than Youth A and “body block” Youth A from getting to\nYouth B’s room. When asked to describe a body block, Staff 1 stated that staff\nmembers place their bodies in a position to prevent a youth from getting to a\ndestination. He stated that there is no specific proximity in which the staff place their\nbodies. He stated that Youth A was faster than he expected, and he ended up\ncolliding with Youth A rather than getting in front of him and Youth A’s body hit\nagainst a wall in the hallway. He stated that the collision was unintentional, but\nYouth A immediately accused Staff 1 of hurting him intentionally. Staff 1 stated that\nhe apologized to Youth A, but he remained escalated and continued to be physically\naggressive with Staff 1. Staff 1 stated that he later learned that Staff 2 was already\ndown the hallway near Youth B’s bedroom and he should have allowed her to\nprevent Youth A from getting to the room instead of running after Youth A. He stated\nthat he felt he had to protect Youth B and did what he thought was best in the\nmoment. Staff 1 stated that he didn’t feel that he could keep youth at the facility safe\nanymore and would be resigning from his position.\nStaff 2 - Staff 2 reported that on 2/28/21 Youth A had been chasing Youth B, so\nYouth B went into his room. Staff 2 was in Youth B’s room with him, with her back\nagainst the door to make sure Youth A couldn’t get inside because Youth A was\nescalated and had a previous altercation with Youth B. She reported that when she\nfelt it was safe for her to leave the room because she couldn’t hear Youth A nearby,\nshe exited the room and stood in the hallway near the door. Youth A attempted to\nrun down the hall toward Youth B’s room and Staff 1 ran after him and tried to get in\nfront of him, but when they came around the corner, which is narrow, Staff 1\nunintentionally collided with Youth A. She stated that she has worked with Staff 1 for\n3 months and does not believe that he would intentionally trip or push a youth.\nDirector of Quality and Risk - Director of Quality and Risk reported that she has\naddressed the use of the term body block with the staff trainers as this is not a term\nused by CPI when teaching physical interventions. She states that she recognizes\nthe concerns with the method being used by staff as it has led to other incidents of\nconcern in the program.\n4",
    "Supervisor 1 - On 3/9/21 I interviewed Supervisor 1 along with DHHS Worker 1 via\nvideo conferencing. Director of Quality and Risk was present during the interview.\nSupervisor 1 reported that he heard Staff 2 call for assistance over the walkie talkie,\nso he responded. When he arrived at the home where Staff 2 was working, he met\nStaff 1 and Youth A outside of the home. Youth A was escalated and pushing Staff\n1. Youth A told Supervisor 1 that Staff 1 had pushed him into a door. Supervisor 1\nreported that Staff 1 interrupted and stated that’s not what happened. Youth A then\nshowed Supervisor 1 his right forearm and left leg. Supervisor 1 stated that the skin\nin these areas looked irritated and was red and peeling. He reported that he watched\nthe video footage of the incident that night and it appeared to him that the collision in\nthe hallway was accidental.\nVIDEO REVIEW\nYouth A is seen hitting, kicking, and grabbing Staff 1’s face and neck while yelling at\nStaff 1 after which Youth A takes off running toward hallway. Staff 1 runs after Youth\nA and they collide at the entrance of the hallway, near a corner. Staff 1’s body\ncollides with Youth A’s right side, causing Youth A to fall sideways against a door\nbefore falling to the floor. He immediately stands up and begins yelling at Staff 1 for\nhurting him intentionally. Staff 2 is standing nearby in the hallway, in clear view of\nthe interaction.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nOn 3/1/21 I received and reviewed a Critical Incident Report (CIR) completed by\nStaff 1 on 2/28/21. The CIR documented the events as reported by Staff 1 during his\ninterview. No injuries were documented on the CIR.\nOn 3/1/21 I reviewed the training documents of Staff 1 verifying that he participated\nin 2-hour verbal de-escalation training on 9/16/20, 14-hour CPI Initial Training\ncompleted on 2/6/20, and a 3-hour CPI 90-day refresher on 6/8/20.\nOn 3/5/2021 I received and reviewed a Medical Note written by the facility’s Medical\nServices Coordinator on 3/1/2021. The note documented that Youth A had a “red\narea” on his left wrist that was “smaller than a dime but larger than a pen hole.” The\nskin was not broken so no treatment was needed.\nOn 3/17/2021 I reviewed a copy of the behavior management system utilized by the\nfacility.\nOn 3/19/2021 I participated in a phone conference with DHHS Worker 1 during\nwhich he reported that his investigation resulted in no findings.\n5",
