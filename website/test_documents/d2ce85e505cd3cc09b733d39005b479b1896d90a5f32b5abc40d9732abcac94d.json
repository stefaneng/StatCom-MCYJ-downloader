    "to the start of employment and every\n12 months thereafter.\nTwo out of seven new employee files reviewed did not have a central registry\nclearance completed within 30 days of the staff's hire date. One staff member\nwas hired on 4/3/23, but her central registry clearance was completed on 3/3/23,\nwhich is 31 days. The facility hired the other staff member on 9/5/23 and allowed\nthe staff member to work without an approved central registry clearance. The\nfacility emailed DCWL GOA the forms on 8/24/23, and the GOA emailed the\nfacility on 8/28/23 notifying them she could not open the attachments. The facility\nnever returned the forms, so DCWL never approved the staff member to begin\nworking at the facility.\nCCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\n(1) An institution shall maintain employee\nrecords for each employee and shall include\ndocumentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the\ntime specified in this rule:\n(j) A written evaluation of the employee’s\nperformance within 30 days of the\ncompletion of the probationary period or\nwithin 180 days, whichever is less, and a\nwritten evaluation of the employee’s\nperformance annually thereafter.\nTwo of three seasoned employee's files did not have an annual evaluation\ncompleted. One staff's annual evaluation was due in July 2023 and one staff's\nannual evaluation was due in November 2023.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n The facility was provided information about background clearance timeframes\nand what to do if the central registry checks are getting close to 30 days old.\n The facility was informed if they have a supervisor leave, they need a process to\nview, track, and complete annual evaluations for employees.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD",
    "Maltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during this\nperiod under review.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's budget and financial audit were reviewed. There were no concerns\nnoted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted the last audit resulted in no findings and there have\nbeen no identified areas of non-compliance over the last year. CA did not identify\nany barriers or systemic factors impacting statute, rule, MISEP, policy and/or\ncontract compliance. CA reported there were no unplanned discharges during the\nperiod of review.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported the support they all provide for each other and receive from\nsupervisor’s is excellent. They reported they feel things amongst staff are\nconsistent and structured because they do not have a lot of turnover. They\nreported they feel they have enough training and adequate training to complete\ntheir position requirements. They reported they have enough resources to help\nand support the youth at the facility. One staff member reported they love the staff\nrecognition and praise during staff meetings. However, the staff member wants to\nensure staff who always go above and beyond are also recognized for \"the little\nthings\" because a lot of times, the little things make the biggest impact in the\nfacility's daily functioning and success. Supervisor reported the direct care staff do\na great job of handling things independently without always involving managers,\nwhich speaks to their work ethic and confidence in their positions.\nYouth interviews were conducted. Youth feel staff interact appropriately with them,\ncare about them and keep them safe. They reported they have enough food at the\nfacility, and they like the food provided. One youth reported she doesn't have the\nfreedom she wishes to have and does not feel safe with one of the other youth in\nthe home.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of the facility was completed on December\n18, 2023. There were no safety concerns observed.",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 12, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 24, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
