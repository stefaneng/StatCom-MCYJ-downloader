    "Agency Staff witnessed two separate alleged assaults to a youth by a CCI staff\nmember while required to supervise youth. Agency Staff were aware of these\nevents minimally since 2/23/22 but failed to comply with CPL Mandated\nreported policy. Alleged abuse/neglect was not reported for over a week after\none of the most recent assaults.\nINVESTIGATION:\nReporting Source 1 and 2 basically reported the same information as in the\nallegation. Their concerns were that an investigation was being conducted at a Child\nCaring Institution regarding the possible assault of Youth A by the staff member who\nwas monitoring him at the hospital. The Reporting Sources stated the alleged\nassaults occurred at the hospital on 2/23/24 and 2/24/2022. Agency Staff witnessed\nthe alleged assaults; however, the allegations were not reported to Central Intake\nuntil almost a week later. The Agency Staff are mandated reporters and are required\nto report allegations of abuse and/or neglect immediately to Central Intake.\nI reviewed case notes in MiSACWIS written by Staff 1 on 2/24/2022, and Staff 1\nprovided clarification to the notes. The notations and clarifications are as follows:\n Upon arriving at McLaren Caro Hospital, Staff 1 walked into the building and\nsigned in right behind the staff member from a Child caring institution who was\nresponsible for monitoring Youth A during the shift. Staff 1 spoke to the Child\ncaring institution staff that was being relieved and the staff member provided\nStaff 1 with an update on Youth A. The staff member from Child caring\ninstitution reported that Youth A slept through the night but woke up in an\nirritated state. Staff 1 said she witnessed Youth A pushing against the Child\ncaring institution staff that was being relieved and was trying to get into the\nhallway. Staff 1 said Youth A attempted to punch the Child caring institution\nstaff who reported on duty to monitor him. The Child caring institution staff put\nknee pads on and immediately threw Youth A onto the floor of the hospital\nroom and scolded Youth A not to punch staff. Child caring institution staff\ncontinued to restrain Youth A and Youth A’s behaviors continued to escalate.\nStaff 1 said five nurses came into the room to hold Youth A down while the\nChild caring institution staff and nurses put Youth A in restraints on his legs\nand arms.\nYouth A fought and started to spit at the nurses and staff member faces. A\nsheet was put over Youth A’s face to prevent him from spitting on the nurses\nand staff. Youth A was given an injection in his back side, Staff 1 said she\nassumed it was to calm Youth A down. Staff 1 said Youth A was able to\nremove his restraints within minutes and continued to do so for about ½ hour,\nwhile the nursing staff continued to put them back on.\n Staff 1 reported Youth A eventually calmed down and asked to eat his\nbreakfast, around 8:45a.m. Restraints were taken off, he drank apple juice, ate\na pancake, sausage, and toast. After breakfast, Child caring institution staff\n611 W. OTTAWA  P.O. BOX 30664  LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/lara  517-335-1980",
    "member attempted to read a book to Youth A. He listened for a while but was\neasily distracted. At one point, a nurse stated that Youth A had not taken his\nmedications from last night or that morning.\n Staff 1 said Youth A was pleasant and asked to play on Staff 1’s phone. A\nnon-violent game was downloaded, and a ten-minute timer was set. When the\ntimer went off, Youth A let Staff 1 know. Staff 1 allowed Youth A to keep the\nphone and look for an appropriate movie to watch. He was told by Child caring\ninstitution staff member that he could not watch Walking Dead or anything but\nPG movies. Youth A attempted a few minutes to watch an appropriate movie\nand gave the phone back to Staff 1.\n About 9:30 a.m., Staff 1 asked if there was anything Youth A could or would\nlike to do, because he had been doing well. Youth A stated that he wanted to\ntake a walk, so Staff 1 and Youth A went to the nurses’ station to ask. The\nnurse agreed that he could take a walk as long as someone was with him.\nStaff 1, Youth A, and the Child caring institution staff member proceeded to\ntake a walk around the hospital floor. Youth A was redirected several times\nfrom going into rooms. A hospital staff member opened the cafeteria so Youth\nA could go in and have a drink of pop. Youth A had a pleasant conversation\nwith cafeteria staff and asked for shrimp, then asked for several other things\nand wanted a snack. The cafeteria staff was unable to give Youth A anything\nbut talked about what she was able to make for lunch and dinner. Staff 1 then\ndirected Youth A out of the cafeteria. Youth A stated he wanted a snack and\nstopped at the vending machines to pick out what he would like. Staff 1 told\nYouth A that if he behaved, she would buy him a snack when he returned to\nhis room. Youth A tried to go to the gift shop, which was not open, and asked\nseveral hospital staff members to open it for him. He was then directed back\ntowards his room. Youth A went into the physical therapy room and refused to\nleave, stating he was allowed in that room. When Staff 1 tried to direct Youth A\nout of the room, he started to escalate. Child caring institution Staff member\naggressively pulled Youth A towards the door; Youth A fell to the ground. Child\ncaring institution staff member and a male nurse then dragged Youth A on the\nfloor back to his room. Youth A then escalated further, got away from staff and\nlocked himself in the bathroom. Youth A then proceeded to break the paper\ntowel dispenser, squirt conditioner all over the ceiling, walls and mirror and\nthrow whatever he could around the bathroom. Hospital maintenance unlocked\nthe door with a screwdriver.\n About 10:30 a.m., during the incident described above Child caring institution\nstaff member grabbed Youth A and put him on the bed, while two nurses came\ninto the room to restrain him. Staff 1 grabbed the bag of restraints while Child\ncaring institution staff member held down Youth A’s legs and the nurses held\nhis upper half. Youth A was again restrained to the bed with 6 restraints. Two\nfor each arm and one on each ankle. Youth A complained of his ankles\nhurting, so the male nurse checked his pulse in both ankles and made sure\n611 W. OTTAWA  P.O. BOX 30664  LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/lara  517-335-1980",
    "there was enough room. A female nurse gave Youth A another shot in the\narm. She was also scratched on the arm while holding Youth A down, she\ncleaned herself and Youth A of blood, right after. Youth A started to calm down\nand asked why his blood was so thick today. Child caring institution Staff\nmember explained that Youth A probably did not have enough water to drink\nand was dehydrated. Staff 1 noticed that there was blood on the sheet under\nYouth A’s arm and dried blood where he may have been given a shot\npreviously.\n About 11:00 a.m., Male nurse talked to Youth A at length, about his behaviors\nand how he would not be allowed to take another walk that day. Youth A said\nhe understood and was calm now that the nurse had given him a “pep talk”\nand wanted out of his restraints. The nurse explained that Youth A needed to\nbe in the restraints for an hour or until he was very calm. The nurse then asked\nif Youth A would like his morning medicine and Youth A stated that he would.\nWhen the nurse returned with two meds, Youth A attempted to negotiate for\nhis release from the restraints in return for taking the medication. There was\nmore talk and Youth A allowed the nurse to put the pills in his mouth and took\na drink of water.\n 11:30 a.m., at this time, Staff 2, the next DHHS worker arrived and Staff 1\nupdated Staff 2 about the morning shift. Staff 1 left the hospital.\nInterview Staff 1\nI interviewed Staff 1 regarding this allegation. She reported basically what was in\nher social work notes regarding the allegation. She added when the Child caring\ninstitution staff member noticed that Youth A was escalated and punching at staff, the\nstaff immediately put his knee pads on and walked towards Youth A in an aggressive\nstance. Staff 1 said the Child caring institution staff member explained to her that Youth\nA had left their staff members, as well as nursing staff, bruised and he hurt his knees,\nwhich is why he was wearing knee pads. Staff 1 said Youth A attempted to run out of\nhis bedroom and that the Child caring institution Staff member grabbed Youth A’s arm\nand forcefully threw him back into the room onto the bed. Staff 1 made the observation\nalong with another staff that the Child caring institution staff was excessive and that the\nstaff seems to be protecting himself and others rather than Youth A. Staff 1 said she did\nnot report the information to Central Intake until a week later because she was waiting\nfor a meeting to discuss the incident with her manager and director. She said she\nimmediately discussed the incident with her supervisor. Staff 1 said she was unsure\nabout this incident and if it was child abuse because she lacked experience in child\ncaring institutions and restraints. Staff 1 said she also observed the hospital staff’s\ninvolvement in the restraint, and she was usure if anything was wrong. Staff 1 said in\nher opinion, Youth A was very aggressive and physical at times, but she felt that Child\ncaring institution staff was overly assertive and that his behaviors were unnecessary.\nStaff 1 said she was unaware of the guidelines put in place for the safety of Youth A and\nothers, and this is why she discussed the incident with her supervisor.\n611 W.

    "Interview Staff 2\nI interviewed Staff 2 regarding the allegation. She reported observing the Child caring\ninstitution Staff member on 2/24/22 exhibit aggressive behaviors towards Youth A and\nthat she reported the information to her supervisor after her shift ended. Staff 2 said she\nwas not sure if the situation rose to abuse or not. Staff 2 said she did not witness the\nstaff member hit Youth A but rather held him down forcefully on the bed while restraints\nwere being applied to his legs and arms. She was concerned about the size\nof Youth A compared to Child caring institution staff member. Staff 2 said a meeting\nwas held with the program manager and the director a week later regarding the incident.\nShe said she was informed to contact central intake 30 minutes later after the meeting.\nInterview Licensing Supervisor\nI interviewed the Licensing Supervisor regarding the allegation. She is the supervisor\nof Staff 1 and Staff 2. The Licensing Supervisor reported she and the administration\nwere aware of the incident at the hospital on 02/24/2022, however, she was not\naware of anything occurring on the 23rd or another incident on another date. She\nsaid Staff 1 and staff 2 (both licensing workers) only supervised Youth A once and\nthat was on the 24th. Both staff (both licensing workers) met with the Licensing\nSupervisor the day after the incident that they were unsure how to categorize what\nthey saw. They described a very aggressive child, an aggressive Child caring institution\nstaff and hospital staff who participated in the restraints and gave the youth injections to\ncalm his behavior. Due to the concerns raised, a meeting was scheduled with upper\nmanagement.\nThe Licensing Worker reported at this meeting with upper management Staff 1 and 2,\nwere again asked to report what they saw. When asked if they felt the child was\nbeing abused, both staff still said they felt what they saw was excessive but could\nnot say they felt it was abuse based on the child’s aggressive and sometimes\nassaultive behavior and need to be restrained, sometimes by more than one\nperson. She said Staff 1 and 2 also didn’t know what the Child caring institution staff\nmember was instructed to do in a situation when a youth is totally out of control. It\nwas decided by upper administration that based on the description of what occurred\nand the use of the word excessive by Staff 1 and 2, the lack of information about\nhow Child caring institution staff person was to perform his job, and the participation of\nhospital staff that a report would be made to Central Intake. Staff 1 and 2 were\ninstructed to call Central Intake immediately. They complied with this directive and\ndirection from upper management.\nDHHS policy for reporting to Central Registry\nDHHS policy regarding reporting child abuse is that any suspicion of child abuse\nshould be reported to Central Intake. The policy states:\nStaff are held to the standards set in the Mandated Reporter Training and information\nin the online manuals for services workers. Department employee who is one of the\n611 W.

Neither of the\nLicensing Workers has experience with child caring institutions,\nor restraints. They both viewed the restraint on Youth A as\npossibly excessive based on Youth’s A’s size. Staff 1 seemed\npuzzled about Child caring institution staff member wearing\nknee pads. Staff 1 and 2 also observed hospital nursing staff\ninvolved in the restraint of Youth A as well as giving Youth A\ninjections to calm him down. They did not describe Child caring\ninstitution staff to be assaultive or to restrain Youth A without\nprovocation. Staff 1 nor Staff 2 reported that they suspected\nchild abuse, although both describe the handling of Youth A’s\nbehavior as excessive.\nIt is for that reason that Staff 1 and 2 sought guidance for their\nsupervisor who sought guidance from their upper administration.\nAfter some discussion among the administrators, Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 were told to contact Central Intake. The incident\noccurred on February 24, 2022, and Central Intake was\ncontacted on March 3, 2022. Staff 1 and 2 did not suspect child\nabuse. Their lack of experience with restraints and the\nparticipation of the medical staff led to their confusion. They\nsought the advice of their superiors who determined that it was\nbest to let Central Intake staff decide if this situation was child\nabuse. Please note the behavior of Child caring institution staff\nmember is the subject of Special Investigation 2022C0137017.\n611 W. OTTAWA  P.O.
