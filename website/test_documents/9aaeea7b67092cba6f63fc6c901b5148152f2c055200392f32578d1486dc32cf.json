This is not\nconsistent with what the video shows.\n• Osceola Youth Center Policy, Standards of Conduct:\nIncludes the expectation staff are to interact with youth in a\nmanner promoting their emotional and physical safety.\n• DHHS Worker interviewed Youth D face to face at Youth\nD’s residence on November 29, 2023. DHHS Worker’s\nnotes from the interview are:\n“[Youth D] reported he did get in trouble prior to leaving the\nfacility. [Youth D] reported he was just joking around but\n[Youth A] told staff he was trying to hurt him. [Youth D] told\nthe [DHHS Worker] he was referring to the incident with\n[Youth A]. [Youth D] was asked to walk the worker through\nwhat happened with him and [Youth A]. [Youth D] stated he\nwas just \"joking\" around on the unit with another youth\n[Youth B]. He reported they were seeing how long they\ncould hold their breath. He reported [Youth A] was sitting\ndown at the table. [Staff 1] was sitting right in front of them.\nHe walked up to [Youth A] and plugged his nose and\ncovered his mouth. He stated [Youth B] walked over and\nwas holding his arms. [Staff 1] told them to stop so they did.\n5",
    "He reported [Youth A] was breathing heavy but also\nlaughing after it. [Staff 1] just told them once and they\nstopped. If he had to put a time frame on it, he would say\nmaybe 10 seconds that he covered [Youth A’s] airways. He\nstated he was not trying to harm [Youth A] at all. They were\njust \"goofing\" around. He was asked if he did anything else\nto [Youth A]. He reported he did pick him up off the ground.\nHe wasn't trying to hurt him. [Youth D] reported they were\njust bored and messing around. He did not try to harm\n[Youth A] at all. He reported he put [Youth A] back on the\nground safely. [Youth D] was asked if other staff allowed\nhim and [Youth B] to act that way. [Youth D] kind of\nlaughed and stated, \"not at all\". [Youth D] gave an example\nthat if [Staff 2] was working he would have stopped them\nwell before any of that happened. He reported none of the\nother staff that generally work on the unit allow that kind of\nbehavior. He reported [Staff 1] was just sitting there and not\nreally doing anything so they just had a fun time. He\nreported the other staff are strict, but they are nice. He had\nno concerns regarding any of the staff at the facility. He felt\nsafe at the facility. He reported he liked the facility\ncompared to other places.”\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance as Staff 1 did not intervene\nto stop Youth B and Youth D from holding Youth A down in a chair\nand covering Youth A’s nose and mouth. Staff 1 sat in a chair\ndoing diamond art, across the table from Youth A during the\nincident, only verbally redirecting Youth B and Youth D. Not only\ndid Staff 1 not follow the facility’s policy of promoting youths’\nphysical safety, but she also allowed a situation that was unsafe\ncreating an environment where Youth A felt scared and afraid.\nAdditionally, Staff 1 was observed sitting in a chair when Youth D\npicked up Youth A and threw Youth A to the floor.\nConclusion Violation Established\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n12/12/2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nBarbara A Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 15, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
