CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nOne CAP, aproved 1/17/23, was the result of the 12/19/22 interim review. The\nagency reported implementation of most parts of their CAP. However, due to\nsome staffing issues, some parts of the CAP were not as successful as\nanticipated. During the previous review the agency had eleven violations. During\nthe current review six violations were found. Three were repeat violations. Overall,\nthe agency has shown improvement in several areas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed. The agency\nreported struggling with staffing over this past year. Over the past several months,\nthere were vacancies in many full-time positions. The agency continues to post\nopen positions but has had difficulty finding qualified applicants. Staff turnover has\nimpacted some implementation of the 1/17/23 CAP. The CAP continues to be\nreviewed during monthly staff meetings. Supervisors have also increased\nmonitoring of timeframes which has aided in improved compliance. Although some",
    "adjustments will be made as a result of the current review, some portions of the\nprior CAP will remain in place as they have been effective.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were found.\nStaff and Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed. One staff was a new licensing worker. She reported\nbeing very satisfied working at this agency. Her supervisor is helpful and\nencouraging. Staff are supportive and kind. The licensing worker stated she gets\neverything she needs there and does not have any concerns or suggestions for\nimprovement. The second staff was a foster care worker that has been with the\nagency less than a year. She reported that her supervisor is knowledgeable and\ngreat at keeping her on track. The worker indicated the agency is engaging and\nlistens well to staff. She did not have any concerns or suggestions for\nimprovement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2022 review. The\nlarge office holds several CSSW programs. The foster care area of the building\nhas adequate space for staff and clients. There is sufficient secure storage for\nconfidential information.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n12/21/2023\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n12/27/2023\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager",
