    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nChange of location/address\nIII. Methodology\nWolverine Human Services Aftercare formerly located at 20600 Eureka in Taylor\nmoved to 20300 Superior in Taylor. An on-site visit was conducted by this\nconsultant on June 29, 2016.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nWolverine’s new office is located in Suite 160 on the first floor of a modern multi-story\nshared office building. There is ample parking and a private entrance for consumers. A\nfoyer separates the exterior entrance from the lobby. Consumers will be “buzzed in” by\na receptionist located left of the foyer. The lobby is spacious with new chairs and a\nlarge flat screen television. Glass windows and locked doors separate the staff offices,\nkitchen/break room, visiting, storage, training and conference rooms on either side of\nthe lobby. Docking stations are available for mobile staff. A locked file cabinet is being\nprepared to house confidential FBI clearance information.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend this agency continue its current licensing status at the new location.\nJuly 5, 2016\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n2"
