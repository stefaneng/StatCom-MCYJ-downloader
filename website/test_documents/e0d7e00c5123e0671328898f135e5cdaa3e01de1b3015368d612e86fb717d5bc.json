    "INVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/23/2022 I reviewed the complaint, and contact was made with the complainant\nvia email by my Peer Consultant. I made initial contact with the agency about the\ncomplaint via email on 5/24/2022.\nOn 5/25/2022, Adoption Departmental Manager (ADM) X provided information about\nthe complaint to me, and a Peer Consultant, via email. ADM X reported her\ndepartment had been in contact with agencies about their closed adoption records.\nThe department had inquired with the agencies as to the status of the closed\nadoption files requested. Her department found that these files either had not been\nsubmitted to the local office at all or were submitted outside the required timeframe\nof 12 to 13 months following finalization. ADM X listed five finalized adoption files for\nMethodist Children Home that may not have been submitted.\nADM X provided clarity on how the files are to be closed and sent to the County\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) office, and the DHS-788 form to\nbe attached on the closed file boxes. Additionally, ADM X provided information with\nrespect to if an agency still has old closed adoption records outside the ones on the\nlist provided related to the complaint; and what that agency should do with those\nrecords. Whether those closed records should come to ADM X’s office or the\nCounty DHHS Office. ADM X reported, when R400.12713 was updated in 2015,\nagencies were instructed to send their backlogged adoption records directly to\nCentral Office. She reported, it has been seven years and at this point agencies\nshould be caught up, and on schedule to send closed records to the local offices\nbetween 12-13 months following finalization. If an agency still has old closed\nadoption records, her office will work with the agency, accept those old records, so\nas to not have the local county office bombarded with old records. She advised it\nwould be very helpful if the agency would include in any corrective action plan the\nagency’s plan to ensure that Lansing/the department gets those old records.\nOn 5/25/2022, via telephone and 6/9/2022 via onsite visit, I interviewed Chief\nAdministrator A about the complaint. Chief Administrator A admitted to having\nclosed adoption files which were beyond a year after finalization that had not been\nsubmitted to DHHS. She reported not becoming aware of the request related to the\nfive named adoption files until 5/3/2022. She advised the agency’s new Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO) forwarded an email to her on that date. The email had\napparently been sent from State Adoption Analyst (SAA)T to the agency’s prior CEO\nin April 2022, about the records. Chief Administrator A said she followed up with\nSAA T via email on 5/3/2022. She inquired where/whom to send the records; but\nSAA T was not able to provide the needed contact information to her. Chief\nAdministrator A made contact with various County DHHS offices; and as of\n5/25/2022 the agency’s plans were to drop off the closed files within the next five\ndays.\nOn 6/9/2022, during my onsite visit, Chief Administrator A reported closed adoption\nfiles for DHHS- North Central and DHHS- South Central were dropped off on\n3",
    "6/8/2022. One record related to Child 5, out of DHHS- Western Wayne, would be\ndropped off on 6/10/2022. Chief Administrator A provided a copy of three closed file\ntracker lists totaling 43 children’s names, whose adoption had been finalized ranging\nfrom January 2019 to October 2020. These closed records were submitted to the\ncounty offices on 6/8/2022. Twenty-nine were submitted to DHHS- North Central,\nwhich included, Child 1, Child 2, Child 3 and Child 4; and 14 were submitted to\nDHHS- South Central.\nDuring my onsite visit I observed the agency’s secure storage for closed records.\nChief Administrator A reported the agency has 15-20 outstanding closed adoption\nrecords where finalization occurred in 2019-2020, which they are working on to\nsubmit to the department. She reported in the past they had a staff person who\nhandled the submission of their finalized records to Lansing/the department. She\nreported the agency’s plan going forward to maintain compliance is that in the month\nof December (starting this year), they will submit the finalized adoptions records for\nthe prior year.\nReviewed\n A copy of an adoption file records’ list from Adoption Departmental Manager X,\nas referenced in this report.\n A copy of an email from SAA T to a staff person at Methodist dated 4/13/2022.\nThe email advised that Child 1’s, Child 2’s, Child 3’s, Child 4’s and Child 5’s\nclosed adoption record had not been provided to DHHS for permanent retention.\nThat if the record had, to please provide the date; and to respond by 4/27/2022.\n A copy of three Methodist Closed File Tracker lists, as referenced in this report:\n One list related to DHHS-South Central file submissions. It showed Chief\nAdministrator A’s signature for Methodist, and DHHS K’s name/signature for\nDHHS-South Central. Both parties dated the form for 6/8/2022.\n The other two lists related to DHHS- North Central file submissions. Both lists\nwere signed and dated for 6/8/2022 by Chief Administrator A. A DHHS-North\nCentral staff signature was blank. Chief Administrator A reported the agency\nforgot to obtain the form/ signature. She provided an email to and from\nDHHS D showing documentation related to the submission, the agency\nforgetting the form; and DHHS D’s thanking Chief Administrator A for the\nsubmissions.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12713 Adoption placement record.\n(5) The Michigan department of human services must\npermanently retain all adoption records for children\nadopted from Michigan's child welfare system. The\nadoption agency must forward any adoption records for\nchildren adopted from the Michigan child welfare system to\nthe department one year after finalization of the adoption.\nThe adoption agency may not retain the original copies or\nany other copies of the adoption records.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency did not timely submit Child 1’s, Child 2’s, Child 3’s,\nChild 4’s, Child 5’s, nor 38 other closed adoption files where the\nrespective child’s adoption had been finalized in 2019 and 2020\ntimely, as required by the rule. Additionally, the agency\nadmitted to having 15-20 other closed adoption cases on\nchildren whose adoptions have been finalized for more than a\nyear. Those case submission to DHHS is pending.\nThe agency is in violation of the rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, continuation of the facility’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant June 23, 2022\nApproved By:\nJune 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
