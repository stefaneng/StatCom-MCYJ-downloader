Compliance\n01/16/2020 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION: The agency allowed an applicant to voluntarily withdraw their\napplication when there was evidence of rule noncompliance.\nINVESTIGATION: An investigation into the allegation was conducted on 1/16/2020\nat Bethany Christian Services. The licensing supervisor stated that the original 3130\nwas sent to DCWL recommending licensure of the foster home applicants. Shortly\nafter the 3130 was sent to DCWL, the licensing worker terminated her employment\nwith Bethany Christian Services and the current licensing supervisor took over.\nThe current licensing supervisor stated a request for further information on the 3130\nwas received from DCWL and he contacted the applicants. He stated while\nspeaking with the potential foster mother she mentioned a police investigation that\nhad been done, and said it was no big deal. The supervisor used a FOIA request to\ngain access to the report which indicated an inappropriate relationship between the\npotential foster father and a teenager. He was not charged.\n2",
    "The current licensing supervisor stated that the potential foster mother also stated\nthat she and her husband went to therapy due to marital problems. This had not\nbeen disclosed to the previous licensing worker and was not in the 3130.\nThe licensing supervisor stated after learning of these situations, he gave them three\noptions; transfer to another agency, withdraw their application or denial of the\napplication. The applicants chose to withdraw their application.\nThis information was corroborated by the foster care supervisor and agency director.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12309 Records check.\n(1) An agency shall, upon receipt of an application, request the\ndepartment of state police to conduct both a criminal history\ncheck and a criminal records check through the federal bureau\nof investigation for applicants.

Additional\nchecks shall pertain to previous licenses, and substantiated\nchild abuse and neglect records for all applicants and persons\nresiding in the home 18 years of age or over in Michigan and in\nall states where the applicant has resided in the 5 years\npreceding the application.\nANALYSIS: The licensing worker that wrote the original 3130 conducted a\ncriminal history check on the applicants. The current licensing\nworker, upon receiving information of further involvement with\nlaw enforcement, submitted a FOIA request to the local county\nsheriff’s department and received additional information\ninvolving the potential foster father applicant.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12310 Initial evaluation.\n(3) The report shall be an assessment of all of the following:\n(i) Marital and family status and history, including current and\npast level of family functioning and relationships and any\nincidents of domestic violence.\n(c) Previous criminal convictions, and substantiated child abuse\nor neglect investigations or concerns brought to the agency’s or\ndepartment’s attention for any member of the household.\n3",
    "ANALYSIS: Upon receiving a request from DCWL for an addendum to the\noriginal 3130, related to previous law enforcement involvement;\nand after learning of martial problems that had not been\ndisclosed to the previous licensing worker, the licensing worker\nfailed to complete an addendum updating the original 3130 with\nthe new information and make an appropriate recommendation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12325 License recommendation.\n(1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nappropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained in\nthe foster home evaluation and any special evaluations.\nANALYSIS: Upon receiving a request from DCWL for an addendum to the\noriginal 3130, related to previous law enforcement involvement;\nand after learning of martial problems that had not been\ndisclosed to the previous licensing worker, the licensing worker\nfailed to complete an addendum updating the original 3130 with\nthe new information and requesting a denial of licensure.
