INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention: (a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to: (ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing a youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff pushed youth down and dragged him across the parking lot.\nInvestigation On 12/5/24 Chief Administrator reported it was alleged that\nYouth A was pushed down to the ground and dragged across the\nparking lot by Staff 1. This allegedly occurred on 12/4/24. Youth A\nsustained scratch marks and a big bruise across his back. Staff 1\nwas placed on administrative leave, pending an investigation.\nChief Administrator was not sure exactly how the bruises and\nscratches occurred as Youth A was not always truthful about\nthings. Youth A initially said he fell down after leaving the building.\nChief Administrator was contacted via email on 12/5/24 and\nreported they did not have any additional information.\nInterviews:\nMDHHS Worker was contacted by phone on 12/6/24 to\ncoordinate interviews. However, interviews were rescheduled for\n12/16/24, due to worker illness. On 12/16/24 MDHHS Worker\nreported they had attempted to briefly interview Youth A on\n12/6/24. However, Youth A refused the interview.\nProgram Manager was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n12/16/24 in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Program Manager\nreported Youth A initially refused a medical on the day of the\nincident, but later went to the hospital. Program Manager reported\nYouth A recently went AWOL and had not returned. Program\nManager agreed to notify DCWL and MDHHS Worker when Youth\nA returned. On 12/23/24 Program Manager contacted DCWL and\nMDHHS Worker via email to report Youth A was no longer placed\nat the facility, as he was moved to a juvenile detention facility due\nto charges stemming from an incident while AWOL.\n2",
    "Staff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/16/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 denied pushing or\ndragging Youth A. Staff 1 stated Youth A was outside, standing by\nthe fence to the employee parking lot. Youth A looked upset. Staff\n1 walked over and asked Youth A if he wanted to talk about\nanything. Youth A did not respond. Staff 1 tapped Youth A’s arm\nand asked again if he wanted to talk. Youth A pulled away and\ntried to swing his fist at Staff 1. Staff 1 stated he tried to block a\nsecond hit by putting Youth A in a “bear hug”. Staff 1 stated his\nintent was to protect himself, but also to help Youth A calm down.\nYouth A was twisting and moving around. Staff 1 stated they\nbecame unbalanced and fell. Staff 1 clarified Youth A landed on\nhis back, with Staff 1 on top of him. Staff 1 moved off Youth A but\nbelieved Youth A hit his back on the parking lot gate sensor when\nhe fell. Staff 2 walked over to assist, and Youth A got up and ran\naway. Youth A later came back and apologized to Staff 1. Staff 1\napologized to Youth A and asked if he wanted to get checked out\nat the hospital. Youth A declined and signed a refusal form. Staff\n1 stated he could not recall which other staff were present, as it\nwas dark and snowing out during the incident. Staff 1 denied\nobserving any marks on Youth A’s back. Staff 1 confirmed he was\nnot trained in one-person standing restraints and was not\npermitted to initiate a restraint by himself. Staff 1 stated that in\nhindsight he realized he should have known better and called for\nassistance when Youth A became physical. Staff 1 reported he\nhad never been involved in an incident of this nature and had no\ndisciplinary action on file prior to this.\nChief Administrator was interviewed face-to-face at the facility\non 12/30/24. Chief Administrator stated she did not witness the\nincident. Staff 1 was immediately placed on leave when the\nallegations were reported. Staff 1 remained on leave until the\ninvestigation was completed. Chief Administrator was waiting for\nthe findings of the investigation before deciding if Staff 1’s\nemployment would continue. The reported behavior seemed very\nuncharacteristic for Staff 1. However, Chief Administrator was\naware that prior to starting his shift on 12/4/24, Staff 1 received\ndevastating news about a murder in his family. Not that it was an\nexcuse for his behavior, but it may have contributed to Staff 1’s\nunexpected behavior. On 1/8/25, Chief Administrator emailed\nDCWL and MDHHS Worker to report the decision was made to\nterminate Staff 1’s employment.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/30/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported he worked on\n12/4/24. Staff 2 had just ended his shift and was sitting in his\n3",
    "vehicle in the employee parking lot, waiting for his car to warm up.\nIt was snowing that day and visibility was not great, but when he\nlooked up, he saw Staff 1 and Youth A in a “scuffle”. Staff 2 got\nout of his car and went to assist. Staff 1 and Youth A were going\nback and forth at one another. Staff 1 appeared to be holding the\nshoulders of Youth A, but not in a way that was trained in Crisis\nPrevention Institute (CPI). Staff 2 stepped in to separate them.\nYouth A refused to tell Staff 2 what happened. Staff 2 stated he\ndid not observe anyone on the ground at any point. The incident\noccurred in the employee parking lot by the fence, but Staff 2 did\nnot see anyone against the fence. Staff 2 stated Staff 1 always\nhad a good relationship with Youth A. Youth A would typically talk\nto Staff 1 over anyone else at the facility. Youth A could be very\nagitated at times and make threats towards people, but Staff 1\nwas always successful at getting Youth A to calm down and\ndiscuss issues. This is why the situation on 12/4/24 was surprising\nto Staff 2. Staff 2 stated after separating them, Youth A was upset\nand pacing. When Staff 2 asked what happened, Staff 1 said\nYouth A was upset and tried to punch him. When Youth A tried to\nswing at Staff 1 a second time, Staff 1 grabbed Youth A.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/30/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported she left her\nshift on 12/4/24 at the same time as Staff 2. However, she pulled\nout of the parking lot, realized she forgot something and parked\nalong the street in the front of the building. Staff 3 ran inside to\nretrieve something, came out, and observed Youth A standing by\nthe parking lot gate with Staff 1. Youth A’s fists were balled up and\nhe appeared upset. Youth A was staring at Staff 1, as if he were\nabout to start a fight. Youth A jumped at Staff 1. Staff 1 pushed\nYouth A down to the ground. Youth A started kicking Staff 1. Staff\n1 grabbed Youth A’s leg and dragged him across the pavement,\nabout two feet. Staff 3 walked over and told Staff 1 repeatedly to\nstop. Staff 2 then approached to assist. Staff 3 was unsure what\nStaff 2 saw due to it being dark and snowing. Staff 2 grabbed Staff\n1 and pulled him away from Youth A. Staff 3 did not observe any\ninjuries on Youth A. Staff 3 denied seeing Staff 1 attempt any CPI\ntechniques prior to pushing Youth A. Staff 3 saw Youth A jump at\nStaff 1, but did not see Youth A hit Staff 1.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at his new placement on\n1/6/25. Youth A did not have any visible marks or bruises on him\nat that time. Youth A reported he preferred being at Wolverine\nCenter, as he had more freedom there. Youth A stated while at\nWolverine Center he had some favorite staff, but Staff 1 was not\none of them. Youth A stated Staff 1 slammed him on his back and\n4",
    "dragged him. Youth A explained that the incident occurred around\n7-8:30PM in the parking lot at Wolverine Center. Youth A was\nupset that night. Staff 1 was in a bad mood due to a family\nmember passing away. Youth A stated when he was upset, he ran\nout of the building. Youth A hit Staff 1 because he was upset. Staff\n1 then picked Youth A up by his shoulders and slammed him on\nhis back, on the ground. Staff 1 then attempted to drag Youth A.\nStaff 3 tried to get Staff 1 to let go of him. Staff 2 also appeared,\nbut did not do anything. Youth A stated he then got up and ran\naway from the building. Youth A reported he eventually returned to\nthe building, and no one spoke with him about the incident. Youth\nA stated he had scratches and bruises on his back, that have\nsince healed.
