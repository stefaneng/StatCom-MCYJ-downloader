IW stated as\npart of her role she fields inquiries regarding youth that are in\nneed of placement. She had received previous emails regarding\nYouth A stating he was ready for a community placement. She\nreviewed the agency vacancy list previously but did not have a\nplacement that matched his needs. She stated the license for FP1\nand FP2 had recently opened so she contacted them regarding\nYouth A. She stated she provided them some information. She\nwas in contact with Foster Care Worker (FCW) and a family team\nmeeting was set up that included Youth A, FCW, IW, FP1 and\nFP2. During the meeting Youth A and FCW provided some\nbackground information and answered any questions that came\nup. She stated after that there was email communication between\nFP 2 and FCW. She was included in the emails, but she was not\npart of further conversation regarding Youth A being placed with\nFP1 and FP2.\nIntensive Placement Unit contacted IW regarding Youth A. She\nstated they sent her his write up, his MARE video and indicated he\nhad made a lot of progress and ready for a community setting. In\ngeneral, upon receiving placement inquiry emails, IW will reach\nout to foster parents that have an opening and explain the\ninformation that was provided to her. Generally, the placement\nwrite up does not have a lot of information. She will reach out to\nthe assigned foster care worker if more information is needed, or\nprospective foster parents have any questions. Once the foster\n2",
    "parents and foster care worker connect, she allows the assigned\nworker to provide additional information or answer specific\nquestions about a youth.\nFoster Parent 1 (FP1) and Foster Parent 2 (FP2) were\ninterviewed together on November 15, 2023, via telephone.\nFP2 stated their concern was they were not made aware of all of\nYouth A’s diagnosis prior to him being placed in their home. She\nstated they were not made aware of all of Youth A’s diagnosis\nuntil the day he moved into their home. They were provided a\nlarge amount of documentation and they did not have adequate\ntime to review and familiarize themselves with. FP2 stated they\nwere provided the most recent trauma assessment for Youth A but\nnot other trauma assessments that had been completed. She\nstated Foster Care Worker (FCW) and Pine Rest had been\nworking with Youth A for a long time and they had adequate\nopportunities to provide all of the information to them but did not\ndo so.\nFP2 stated they were contacted by their licensing agency\nregarding a few youths that were in need of placement. Regarding\nYouth A, the agency described his profile and did not have\nconcerns with him in their home. At that time, the licensing agency\nintroduced them to Youth A’s foster care case worker. During the\nintroductory call with FCW there was a discussion regarding Youth\nA’s trauma history and diagnostic history. FP2 stated they were\nonly informed Youth A was diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD.\nFP1 stated FCW informed them Youth A was born to an addicted\nmother. FP1 inquired if Youth A demonstrates any type of\nbehavior that may be associated with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and\nwas told he does not. Upon review of documentation, they read\nYouth A tested positive for opiates including heroin at birth and\nthat was not disclosed to them prior to placement.\nShe further explained they were not able to provide the required\n14-day notice to the agency due to an emergency situation where\nthey were not receiving appropriate responses from professionals\ninvolved with Youth A and, as a result, felt unsafe to continue the\nplacement.\nFP2 stated they felt like Youth A’s placement with them was\nrushed and reckless. FP2 further explained they felt as though\nthey were tricked into taking placement and were not adequately\nprepared for all of Youth A’s needs and behaviors due to not being\ntold up front. FP2 stated the medication they were provided for\nYouth A did not seem to match all of his needs. In addition,\n3",
    "service providers, including home based therapy and\nWraparound, had not started timely.\nFP1 stated they had 2 calls with several individuals involved with\nYouth A less than one month prior to his placement in their home.\nHe stated they were not made aware of all of the individuals\ninvolved and their roles until that time.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed on November 28,\n2023, via video conference. CA stated she was surprised FP1\nand FP2 felt they were not provided all of the relevant information\nregarding Youth A prior to placement. The agency goal was for\nthe foster parents to be as prepared as possible. CA stated the\nagency held multiple meetings that included FP1 and FP2 as well\nas Youth A’s therapist from Pine Rest and the LOTUS program\nand tried to include everyone at each step along the way and not\nomit anything. In addition, the agency worked to build a support\nnetwork for Youth A prior to his placement with FP1 and FP2.\nCA stated Youth A was never diagnosed with anything related to\nFetal Alcohol. Over the years there have been questions\nregarding this but during his stay at Hawthorn it was determined\nthere was not appropriate documentation and testing to make this\ndiagnosis.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FC Supervisor) was interviewed on\nNovember 28, 2023, via video conference. She stated FP1 and\nFP2 came to the agency’s attention through an Intensive\nPlacement Unit search. Once they were identified as a potential\nplacement the agency was in contact with the licensing agency\ninitially and then foster parents were brought into the\nconversation. There was an initial meeting with the licensing\nagency, FCW, FP1 and FP2. FCW provided a lot of information\nregarding Youth A’s history and emphasized how intensive his\nneeds have been historically, especially in community placements.\nFP1 and FP2 indicated they were interested in pursuing\nplacement. At that point, there were phone calls, emails and\nmeetings where documentation was provided. These contacts\nincluded the therapist at the step-down program, LOTUS. FC\nSupervisor stated FP1 and FP2 were focused on prior concern\nthat Youth A may have been Fetal Alcohol. However, Youth A was\nnever diagnosed with that. She emphasized some of the\ndocumentation was older and it should be reviewed in a\nprogressive manner to get a better understanding of Youth A’s\ndiagnoses and current needs. During his most recent placement\nat Hawthorne this was reviewed again, and it was determined a\nFetal Alcohol Diagnosis is not appropriate.\n4",
    "Foster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed on November 29,\n2023, via video conference. He stated there were numerous\nstatewide searches for placement. The Intensive Placement Unit\nidentified FP1 and FP2 as a possible placement. FCW stated he\ninitially connected with FP1 and FP2 approximately 2 months prior\nto Youth A being placed in their home. FCW stated the agency\nconducted a 2-month transition prior to placing Youth A with FP1\nand FP2. The transition consisted of local visits, multiple emails,\nphone calls, and video conference meetings. During meetings\nthere were numerous discussions regarding Youth A’s behavioral\nhistory and diagnosis. FCW stated he connected FP1 and FP2\nwith Youth A’s therapist at Pine Rest and was told they had\nregular communication. In addition, there were almost daily phone\ncalls between Youth A and FP1 and FP2 for approximately 2-3\nweeks prior to placement as well as occasional phone calls\nbetween Youth A and FP1’s adult daughter. FCW stated he\nprovides hard copies of documentation that was previously\nreviewed at the time of Youth A’s placement with FP1 and FP2.\nFCW stated FP1 and FP2 became upset after Youth A was placed\nin their home after reviewing documentation that mentioned Fetal\nAlcohol Syndrome. He stated that was not shared due to it being\nruled out as a diagnosis while Youth A was placed at Hawthorne.\nFCW stated Youth A’s CTAC assessment thoroughly documents\nYouth A’s behavioral history and diagnosis, and that document\nwas provided to FP1 and FP2 by FCW via email in August 2023.\nFCW stated he had regular meetings with Pine Rest regarding\nYouth A and FP1 and FP2 had been invited to those meetings. He\nstated they attended the majority of the meetings once they were\ninvited so they were aware of the updates.\nFCW stated he was somewhat concerned that FP1 and FP2 were\nnewly licensed and had not had a child placed in the home before.\nHe stated that he wanted to make sure they had all of the\ninformation regarding Youth A so they were aware of what they\nwere committing to.\nYouth A’s Therapist (Therapist) was interviewed on\nDecember 6, 2023, via telephone. He stated he was Youth A’s\ntherapist during his time at the LOTUS program. He stated he\nattended meetings with FP1 and FP2 present when FCW\ndiscussed Youth A’s history, behaviors and diagnosis. He clarified\nthe majority of the meetings took place prior to Youth A being\nplaced with FP1 and FP2. Therapist stated he was also open and\n5",
    "honest regarding Youth A’s behaviors during meetings and\ndiscussions with FP1 and FP2 present. He stated he worked with\nFCW to coordinate multiple visits between Youth A and FP1 and\nFP2.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Email from Youth A’s assigned foster care worker to\nlicensing agency intake worker on April 13, 2023. The email\nstated: “We have really struggled to find a placement for\nhim as he has been in multiple residential facilities and two\nadmissions to Hawthorn Center. He truly has made\nSIGNIFICANT progress during this admission at Hawthorn\nCenter. He was admitted in September 2020 and cleared\nfor discharge on November 16, 2022. Unfortunately, the\nresidential facilities have probably labeled him in a negative\nlight and are not willing to give him a chance. It will take a\nvery specific trauma-informed foster home to take him\non. The psychologist at Hawthorn Center has informed us\nthat she would be willing to work with a prospective\nplacement to learn his triggers and to learn strategies to be\nsuccessful with him as he has experienced so much trauma\nand loss in his 12 years of life”. Attachments to the email\ninclude a 1.5-page treatment update and recommendation\nsummary from Hawthorn Center that lists current diagnoses\nand medication.
