Staff 1 placed Youth A in\na standing hold after Youth A punched Staff 2 in the head. Youth\nA climbed on a table causing Staff 1 and Youth A to fall to the\nground and Staff 1 let go of Youth A as they were falling.

    "through the window in the door of the bedroom hallway, but she\nwas able to see the restraint through the window in the office\nwhere she made the phone calls. She denied observing Staff 1\never push Youth A into the wall. After speaking with Youth A’s\nmother, Youth A’s mother is reported to not be surprised by the\nrage Youth A was displaying.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n4/11/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nresponding to a call. As soon as he entered the unit, he observed\nYouth A being physically aggressive towards Staff 1, Staff 2, and\nSupervisor 2. Staff 2 and Supervisor 2 were standing between\nYouth A and Staff 1 with Staff 1 standing behind a table and away\nfrom Youth A. Youth A was saying all the staff were going to be\nfired and Foster Care Worker was going to get Youth A out of this\nprogram. Youth A attempted to pull the fire alarm off the wall\nbefore attacking Staff 2. Staff 2 put out her hands to block Youth\nA’s fists. Supervisor 3 stepped between them, and Youth A started\nswinging at Supervisor 3 to which Supervisor 3 blocked with his\nhands. Youth A increased the verbal aggression while Supervisor\n2 continued with the verbal de-escalation. Supervisor 3 reported\nwhen Youth A was not able to strike Supervisor 3, Youth A began\nto spit on Supervisor 3 causing Supervisor 3 back up, giving more\nspace. Youth A ran after Supervisor 2 causing Supervisor 3 to\nstep between them again.

Supervisor 3 never observed\na mark on Youth A's chin but did a few days later. Supervisor 3 did\nnotice bruising on Youth A’s upper arms.\nNurse was interviewed via phone on 4/25/2024. She reported\nobserving Youth A on 4/8/2024 and receiving information from\nstaff following the restraint on the day of the restraint. In her\nobservation of Youth A, she noted that the bruise on his chin was\ninconsistent with the information about being slammed against the\ndoor frame by Youth A. She reported if Youth A was slammed\nagainst the door frame, there would be other marks rather than\njust a small bruise on Youth A’s chin. She believed Youth A may\nhave received the mark on his chin when falling to the floor\nalthough, Youth A reported falling backwards at the time. She\nreported the marks on Youth A’s arm appears to be from a finger\nbut could have been caused when Staff 1 and Youth A fell to the\nfloor and didn’t appear to be malicious in any manner. It appears\nthat the grip was tightened at some point.\n8",
