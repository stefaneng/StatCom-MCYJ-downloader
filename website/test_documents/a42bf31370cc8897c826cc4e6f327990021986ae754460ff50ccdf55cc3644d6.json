Foster Care Supervisor has recently transitioned to a\nnew position at the agency and is no longer assigned to the case.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via Teams on 4/13/2023.\nShe reported the court has not ordered parenting time for Parent\nA, so she has not seen Youth A since his birth.

She reported that she has not been to any of the\ncourt hearings, but Foster Care Worker told her that parenting\ntime has not been ordered.\n5",
    "DOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n• Court Orders\no Youth A placed in foster care on 1/17/2023, hearing\nadjourned for continuation, parenting time not\naddressed.\no 2/13/2023 hearing adjourned.\no 3/28/2023 ordering Parent A’s parenting time\nsuspended “until such time as mother avails herself\nto the department”.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance due to the court order requiring\nParent A to participate in services prior to beginning parenting\ntime and Parent A’s lack of participation.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 24, 2023\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 25, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
