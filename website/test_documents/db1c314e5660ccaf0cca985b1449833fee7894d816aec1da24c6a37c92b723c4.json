Youth B then\nbegan to touch Youth A inappropriately as Youth A told Youth B to stop. Youth B\nsucked Youth A's penis, licked Youth A's buttocks and anally penetrated Youth A.\nYouth A was shaking uncontrollably and felt pain in his rectum. Youth B then\ninstructed Youth A to sit up on the bed and Youth B sat on Youth A's erect penis and\nmoved up and down until Youth A ejaculated inside Youth B.\nThe incident lasted no longer than 15 minutes, and during this time the on-duty staff,\nStaff 1, and the on-duty supervisor were on another wing of the facility making their\nrounds. Youth B admitted to sneaking into Youth A's room but denies any sexual\ninteraction. There are video cameras in the facility facing Youth A's room, but the\ncameras did not catch Youth B entering or leaving the room. Youth A was\ntransported to the hospital for an exam and when he is discharged, Youth A will be\nplaced on a quarantine unit for 14 days, so he will not have any contact with Youth\nB.\nThere have been previous allegations involving Youth A and Youth B, but nothing\nhas ever been substantiated.

Special Investigation 2021C0219026 involved Youth A and Youth B\nengaging in sexual acts with each other. No violations were found. In Special\nInvestigation 2021C0108010 the facility was found in violation because a youth was\nable to enter another youth’s bedroom and assault him.

Youth A denied the allegation that force was used.\nHe did admit the sexual acts were consensual. The report stated the facility was\nensuring heightened supervision for Youth A. Another investigation found that Youth\nA had touched another youth, not Youth B. Youth A has charges of Criminal Sexual\nConduct (CSC) 1st and 3rd degree.\n4",

He is 19 years\nold and has made some progress at the facility. She believes he is appropriately\nplaced. Youth A knows treatment but has a hard time not grooming or flirting with\nothers. Currently he is in quarantine for 14 days and she has been told she cannot\neven talk to him on the phone as he needs to stay in his room. He has had other\nallegations at the facility and he has been moved to different Pods due to those\nallegations.\nProgram Director: An e-mail was sent to the Program Director on 3/30/21. He\nreported that Youth A was in quarantine and could only be interviewed via Zoom.

Youth A said he remembered Youth B turning him\naround to penetrate him. Youth A was shaking and telling Youth B to stop. Youth B\nthen said it was Youth A’s turn and told Youth A to turn around while Youth B licked\nYouth A’s butt. Youth A could not remember how many times Youth B penetrated\nhim, but it was on and off. Youth A turned around and Youth B sucked his penis.\nYouth A said he then sat up and felt pain in his rectum. Youth B then turned around\nand sat on Youth A’s erect penis. Youth B moved up and down until Youth A\nejaculated. Youth B then licked the ejaculation off Youth A’s penis. Youth A wrote\nthat he enjoyed it, but he did not want it to happen. Youth B resumed penetrating\nYouth A until he suddenly stated he was done and left the room. Staff 1 came to\nYouth A’s room and Youth A told him Youth B had raped him.\nThe incident report from staff stated Youth A was immediately taken to another pod.\nHe was then transported to the hospital for an exam.\nPolice: The police department was contacted, and it was reported that the detective\nhad three investigations at the facility involving Youth A.\nYouth B Interview: Youth B was interviewed at the facility on 4/1/21.

Youth B stated he thought Staff 1 was \"resting his eyes.\" Youth B went\ninto Youth A's bedroom around midnight.

He stated he has\nbeen at the facility for seven years and he always works at night. On the night of the\nincident he came in around 10:30pm. Youth B was out of his room and gave some\nexcuses as to why he did not want to go back in his room. Another staff tried to get\nYouth B to go to his room, but Youth B continued to refuse. Staff 1 had Youth B take\na seat at the control window so he could see him. Staff 1 completed paperwork he\nwas required to do and would occasionally go to the J pod side of the control room in\norder to complete paperwork over there.

    "Policy: The facility’s Supervision and Staffing Policy states the following:\n Staff are responsible for the monitoring and supervision of the youth at all\ntimes. Staff may not leave youth unattended for any reason.\n Staff need to maintain continuous line of sight supervision when youth are\noutside of their bedroom.\n Staff are to be awake during youth sleeping hours.\nStaff 1 Employee File: Staff 1 was hired on 2/16/16. During his time at the facility\nhe was disciplined four times. Three of those disciplines were due to attendance and\nthe fourth was due to failing to abide by safety rules and policies. Since 2020 Staff 1\nhas received nine separate trainings on Supervision of youth.\nPre-exit: A meeting was held with the Program Director and the Chief Administrator\non 5/6/21. They both indicated the problem with the doors was fixed. A company\ncame out and looked at the locks and repaired some of them. The reason it took so\nlong was that it took some time to find a local vendor.\nThe director was informed that the bedroom doors can still be popped open from the\noutside. A safety plan will need to be in place to address the doors. The facility's\nassigned consultant worked with them to come up with a safety plan.\n9",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: All youth reported that Staff 1 sleeps on his overnight shifts.\nStaff 1 did not follow the facility’s policies on Supervision which\nled to Youth B being able to enter Youth A’s bedroom.\nTechnical Assistance: The facility should quarantine youth\naccording to the MDHHS guidelines. Youth should only be\nquarantined if they were exposed to someone who is suspected\nof having COVID rather than every time they leave the facility.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nThis is a repeat violation cited during Special Investigations\n2021C0108025, 2020C0219029, 2020C0219019, and\n2020C0108070 with CAP’s accepted on 4/22/21, 5/18/20,\n5/21/20, and 1/27/21.\n10",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform the duties of the position assigned.\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position\nassigned.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 indicated he was aware the youth could get into each\nother’s bedroom. Youth A and Youth B both have CSC charges\nand were already found to have acted out sexually with each\nother. Despite this, Staff 1 did not provide adequate supervision\nfor the youth on the night of the incident which indicates he does\nnot have the ability and/or the experience to perform the duties\nas assigned to him.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nThis is a repeat violation cited during Special Investigation\n2021C0108004 with a CAP accepted on 12/23/20.\n11",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4407 Facility and premises maintenance.\n(1) A facility and premises shall be maintained in a clean,\ncomfortable, and safe condition. The facility shall be\nlocated on land that is properly drained.\nANALYSIS: All the youth interviewed indicated they could get into certain\nbedrooms when those bedrooms were locked. This incident\noccurred on 3/28/21. During a visit to the facility on 5/6/21 the\nyouth continued to state they could get the doors open. Youth D\nwas able to demonstrate this on his bedroom door. This was an\nissue that was brought up and addressed in a CAP dated\n12/22/20. Because the youth can enter each other’s bedrooms\nin a secure facility, the facility is found to not be maintained in a\nsafe condition.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nThis is a repeat violation cited during Special Investigation\n2021C0108010 with a CAP accepted on 12/23/20.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon acceptance of a Corrective Action Plan, it is recommended that the facility be\nissued a 2nd provisional license.\n5/12/21\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 16, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n12"
