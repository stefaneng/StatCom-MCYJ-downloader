    "Placement in independent living may be an acceptable living\narrangement for youth 16 years or older. Prior to placement in\nindependent living, the caseworker must assess the youth, with\nthe Casey Life Skills Assessment, as being prepared for\nindependent living and demonstrate a pattern of mature\ndecision making.\n3 of 3 IL files reviewed did not contain Casey Life Skills documentation.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas\n Dates emergency procedures practiced need to be documented in each\nhome study\n Contacts with the required caregivers with youth in CCI’s should be\ndocumented in case contacts\n All signed documents should include dates of signature\n Contact with secondary caregivers shall be documented clearly in the case\ncontacts at the required intervals\n FTM’s must be linked to the correct report\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nConsultation was provided regarding developing a consistent plan for uploading and\nmaintaining documents within each case file.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted 5 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The agency is in compliance with\nthe following:\nSIR 2021C0112010 dated 3/21/21, CAP Approved 4/14/2021\nSIR 2021C0112012 dated 1/21/21, CAP Approved 2/1/2021\nThe agency is not in compliance with the following as noted within the\nviolations in this report:\n5/30/2019 INTERIM, CAP Approved 6/28/2019\n06/4/2020 RENEWAL, CAP Approved 7/21/2020\nSIR 2021C0112017 dated 3/23/2021, CAP Approved 4/14/2021\nChief Administrator Assessment – I reviewed the Chief Administrator Assessment\ndated 5/20/2021 which indicated that while the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and\nstaff turnover made compliance difficult in areas such as face to face contacts,\n9",
    "obtaining signatures, completing medical passports timely, and conducting FTM’s as\nrequired, the CAP submitted following the 2020 licensing inspection has had a\npositive impact resulting in improved compliance overall. The findings of this\ninspection corroborate the assessment, with the addition of concerns related to\nuploading documentation and completing and approving service plans timely.\nCHRI - On 5/24/2021 I virtually viewed the storage of the key and the locked storage\narea for CHRI information. I also viewed the dissemination and destruction logs\nstored in this secure area.\nOther Document Review - On 5/23/2021 I reviewed the agency’s current financial\nrecords, AFPRR, Organization Chart, and case ratios. While the agency has had a\nsignificant reduction in census resulting in a dramatic decrease in revenue, they\nwere able to maintain financial solvency. This reduction in census has allowed for\ncompliance with case assignment ratios as well.\nStaff Interviews – The staff reported that there have been several\nstaffing/supervision changes during the year, which has led to adjustments in how\nwork is completed, but there has been regular communication and support provided\nby administration. The staff described issues with documents being uploaded timely\nand consistently due to supervisors requiring this be done differently amongst\nteams. This was reflected in the files I reviewed.\nVII. ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo Safety Concerns Identified\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules or MISEP requirements and contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\n10",
