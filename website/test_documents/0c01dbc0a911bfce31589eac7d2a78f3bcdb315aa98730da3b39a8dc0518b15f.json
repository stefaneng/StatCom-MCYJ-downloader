    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112: Staff Qualifications\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nDescription following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Unknown male staff is raping Youth A at the facility daily and staff\nare “hitting” on her.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on 3/6/25.\nComplainant reported Youth A was raped by a male staff every\nday and staff were hitting on her (flirting). Complainant reported\nYouth A did not provide her any details to these allegations.\nComplainant reported she has never seen any staff act\ninappropriately towards Youth A. Complainant reported Youth A\nhas been in and out of the facility since 2/7/25 due to self-harming\nbehaviors. Youth A has been at the hospital and not at the facility.\nDue to this, the allegations do not make sense, because Youth A\nis not at the facility daily. Complainant reported Youth A has made\nnumerous allegations with the intentions to be removed from the\nfacility. Complainant reported Youth A is usually on a 1:1 staffing\nwhen she returns from the hospital, which means that only female\nstaff are allowed to supervise her. Complainant 1 reported Youth\nA is known to fabricate things.\nAdministrator was interviewed on 3/7/25 at the facility.\nAdministrator reported Youth A has not been at the facility daily\nbut at the hospital. Administrator reported Youth A was at the\nfacility from 2/1/25-2/9/25 and 3/3/25-3/6/25. All other days she\nwas hospitalized due to self-harming behaviors. Administrator\nreported when youth are placed on a 1:1 staffing, the staff\nsupervising are normally female. Administrator reported there\nwould not be a time that only one male is staffing the girl’s unit.\nAdministrator reported there are no grievances filed by Youth A.\nThe following interviews were conducted at the facility with\nMDHHS Worker on 3/20/25.\nInitially Youth A was to be interviewed at Kids Talk on 4/1/25, but\ndue to her recanting allegations, the Kids Talk was cancelled.\nYouth A reported she has never been sexually abused by a staff\nat the facility. Youth A reported she has never been with any male\n2",
    "staff on the unit alone. Youth A reported no staff has ever touched\nher in an inappropriate way. Youth A reported every time she has\nbeen on a 1:1 it has been a female staff. Youth A reported no staff\nhas ever flirted with her or “hit on her.”\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 both reported they work on Youth A’s unit.\nBoth reported they have never witnessed or heard about any staff\nsexually assaulting Youth A. Both reported they have never heard\nany staff, including themselves flirt with Youth A. Both reported\nYouth A is frequently on 1:1 staffing and male staff do not\nsupervise female 1:1 supervision. Both reported they have never\nseen a male on her 1:1 supervision. Both reported male staff are\nnot left alone with the youth on the unit. Staff 1 additionally\nreported it would be impossible to sexually assault a youth due to\ncameras everywhere in the unit.\nYouth B reported she is on the same unit as Youth A. Youth B\nreported she has never heard anyone state they have been raped\non the unit. Youth B reported she has not seen anyone raped on\nthe unit. Youth B reported she has never seen male staff enter\ninto Youth A’s bedroom. Youth B reported when a youth is on a\n1:1 staffing, only female staff are allowed to monitor the youth.\nYouth B reported she has never heard any staff flirt with or “hit on”\nyouth in the program.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the Staff and Client Interaction policy.\n…Male staff are not to make visual checks of a resident’s\nroom…Staff members should never present themselves in\na manner that could be construed as flirtatious or sexual in\nnature to clients.\n• I reviewed Youth A’s hospitalization dates through Youth\nA’s Demographics document. Youth A was at the hospital\nfrom 2/9/25-2/20/25. On 2/20/25, she returned to the facility\nand then was taken back to the hospital and stayed there\nuntil 3/3/25.\n• There are no 1:1 observation for 2/1/25-2/8/25 and 3/3/25-\n3/6/25; therefore, Youth A was with her group when she\nreturned from the hospital.\n• There are no grievances filed by Youth A.\nAnalysis The agency is found compliant with this rule. Youth A reported she\nwas not sexually assaulted nor verbally flirted with by staff. Staff 1,\nStaff 2, and Youth B all reported they have never heard or seen\nanyone sexually assault or flirt with Youth A.\n3",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical Assistance was provided for R.400.4407: Facility and\npremises maintenance. Inside the facility building, there were\nmultiple plywood boards screwed to the walls due to damage. This\ndamage was caused by the youth housed in the building. Based\non an interview with Administrator 2 on 3/28/25, the plywood has\nbeen there for about a month. Due to the current destructive\nbehavior of the youth, they were planning on keeping the plywood\nup until they were able to change the culture. It was discussed\nthat the plywood is not considered “sound and in good repair” as\noutlined in R.400.4407. Although it may take time to fix the\ndamaged caused by the youth, the agency cannot wait until the\nculture of the youth is less destructive to make the necessary\nrepairs. The agency is to come up with a date that they will make\nthe necessary repairs and provide this to their assigned\nconsultant.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n4/18/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.

    "summary": "The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services investigated allegations of a male staff member sexually assaulting a youth daily and staff flirting with her at the Vista Maria facility. The investigation found the allegations unsubstantiated, as the youth recanted her claims, multiple interviews and document reviews contradicted the initial report, and the youth's frequent hospitalizations made the alleged daily assaults implausible. Based on the evidence gathered, the facility was found to be in compliance with all applicable rules, with no substantial violations identified. The facility's staff is cleared of wrongdoing in this matter.",
