He reports being a\ncontingent staff at the facility for six years noting that he is not assigned to one\nspecific pod and is aware of PREA. The allegations were read to him as he did not\nrecall anything out of the ordinary while on pod A approximately two months ago.\nHe recalls resident C standing at resident A’s door and repeatedly walking back and\nforth to resident A’s bedroom door and peering in window. Staff person 1 states\nquestioning resident C as to why he was standing at resident A’s door and\nrepeatedly asked for him to step-down.

Therapist states administration was made aware of the\nincident and it was investigated.\nIncident report dated 06/26/2019 was reviewed. It states resident’s A and C were\nobserved continually fondling each other under the pod table. Once redirected to\nseparate from each other, it was observed that resident C had an erection.\nAppropriate disciplinary measures have been taken.\n4",
    "Resident A was again interviewed on 08/29/2019. He was questioned about the\n06/26/2019 incident involving him and resident C. He states resident C wanted him\nto do it (fondle him) and that he did it over his clothing. He states staff person 2 was\non the pod and intervened when she observed what was occurring under the table.\nResident A was also questioned about him admitting to giving resident A oral sex.\nResident A states the incident occurred prior to the 06/26/2019 incident and within\nthe visitation area during phone calls. Resident A reports he, and resident’s C and D\nwere transported to the visitation area for phone calls by staff person 3. Staff person\n3 entered one visitation room with resident D to make his phone call, whereas\nresident C and D were placed in another visitation room across the hall. Resident A\nstates the room, this writer and he were sitting in for this interview, was the same\nroom he and resident C were placed in.

He then states that\nhe stopped again when he heard staff person 3 exit the visitation room with resident\nD and enter the room that he and resident C were in. Resident A states staff person\n3 asked what residents A and C were doing and that he informed her that he had\njust performed oral sex on resident C. It is noted that resident A repeatedly stated\nthat staff person 3 did not report the incident.

It is noted that resident C\nexclaimed “Oh, no. Not more” when he saw this interviewer again. Resident C was\nquestioned about the 06/26/2019 incident involving he and resident A. He states\nresident A “grabbed my stuff” from under the table and that he continued to grab for\napproximately one to two minutes. Resident C states staff were present and that he\ntold resident A to stop. Resident C was also questioned about an alleged incident\ninside the visitation area involving he and resident A. Resident C states, “She said\nshe sucked my (expletive).” Resident C denies the incident as occurring though\nstates “they (the pod) said she did it”, as well as staff person 3. Resident C\nrepeatedly denied the allegations of oral sex occurring and adamantly exclaimed\nthat there are no cameras in the visitation area. Resident C reports sitting in the\nvisitation room in front of the window and that he had visual contact of staff person 3\nduring the entire time of resident D’s phone call. Resident C does not recall\nobserving any security personnel or other staff being present other than staff person\n3 in the other visitation room.

    "Former staff person 3 was interviewed via telephone on 08/31/2019. She states\nbringing residents A, C and D to the visitation area for phone calls. She reports her\nand resident D being in the visitation room closest to the control room and has a\nroom next to it with a window that spans the distance of the connecting wall starting\nat approximately four feet from the floor. She reports residents A and C were placed\nin the room across the hall that has a window across from where her room was\nlocated. She states being able to directly observe resident C sitting in front of the\nwindow though could not see resident A as he was sitting in a chair where the wall\nbegan. After resident D’s phone-call she went into the visitation room where\nresident A and C were located and did not observe anything out of the ordinary. She\nstates resident A did not inform her of any inappropriate sexual interactions\noccurring while she was in the other room with resident D as he reports. She reports\nfacility management implemented a process in which any additional residents during\nphone calls be placed in the adjoining, entire windowed, room only.\nStaff person 4 was interviewed via telephone on 08/31/2019. He does not report\nbeing made aware of any allegations involving residents A and C in the visitation\narea. He states room 1 is where phone calls are to occur and the room next door\nthat shares a window should be where any additional residents are to be placed as\nto maintain constant visual supervision of them. He states residents should not be\nplaced in the room across the hall. He reports making rounds through the visitation\narea though is not required to provide direct visual supervision of residents as the\nstaff person accompanying the residents are to supervise.\nDirector was interviewed on 08/28/2019. He reports resident A making allegations\nregarding him performing oral sex on resident C after the 06/26/2019 incident\ninvolving him grabbing resident C on the pod. He reports an internal investigation\noccurred and the facility determined the allegations to be unfounded. He further\nstates staff person 3 did not report any inappropriate behaviors occurring or being\ninformed of any inappropriate behaviors occurring after the phone calls.\nStaff persons 2 was not interviewed she terminated her employment with the facility\nprior to the onset of this investigation.\nThe facility is aware of the allegations regarding a resident who throws feces and is\nbeing addressed with clinical staff.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Staff qualifications.\n(1) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nANALYSIS: There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that staff instructed\nresident A to get naked. Resident A is transgendered with a\nhistory of fashioning female undergarments with facility supplied\nclothing. Approximately two months ago, resident C repeatedly\napproached resident A’s bedroom door and interacted with him\nthrough his closed bedroom door. Resident C assumed\nresident A was naked under his blanket though could not\nconfirm. Staff person 1 redirected resident C from resident A’s\ndoor-window and questioned resident A what was happening. It\nis noted that resident’s A and C previously engaged in sexually\ninappropriate behaviors which occurred around the same time\nperiod as resident A’s allegations.\nThere is further no conclusive evidence to suggest staff person\n1 of inappropriate sexual dialogue occurring as resident A\nalleges.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nsupervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these\nadministrative rules and in the agency's program statement and\nto provide for the continual needs, protection, and supervision of\nresidents.\nANALYSIS: The facility did not provide for adequate supervision of\nresidents. Staff brought three residents into the visitation area\nfor phone calls. Staff person 3 placed two residents inside of\none visitation room, whereas she and the third resident were in\na separate room across the hall. Windows are noted in both\nvisitation rooms, but the entire rooms cannot be viewed. Staff\nreport being able to directly observe resident C through the\nwindow, but not resident A as he was sitting in a chair where the\nwall blocked her visual line of sight. Security personnel walked\nthrough the visitation area but did not maintain constant visual\ncontact with residents A and C as that was staff person 3’s\nresponsibility.\nIt cannot be conclusively determined whether resident A and C\nengaged in inappropriate sexual contact while in the visitation\nroom. Resident A states he gave oral sex to resident C,\nwhereas resident C denies such an incident as occurring. Such\ncontact appears probable given their 06/26/2019 confirmed\nincident of fondling and because staff person 3 could not directly\nobserve resident A as he was initially seated behind a wall and\nout of her view. It is noted that the facility implemented\nunwritten procedures in which additional residents be placed\nonly in the adjourning visitation room with full window, rather\nthan any other visitation rooms in which constant visual contact\ncannot be maintained.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n8",
