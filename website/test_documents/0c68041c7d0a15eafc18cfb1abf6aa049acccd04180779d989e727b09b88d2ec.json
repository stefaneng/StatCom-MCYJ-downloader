When Staff 1 let Youth B go, Youth B hit Staff 1 and\nStaff 3 reported Staff 1 said “if you hit me, I will hit you” and hit\nYouth B in his right facial cheek.

    "summary": "On July 20, 2025, Staff 1 at Adrian Group Home, after youth became dysregulated and aggressive, struck Youth A in the face (leaving a small scratch) and later slapped and pushed Youth B, also making derogatory verbal threats. The investigation substantiated these physical and verbal abuses, which violate policies prohibiting physical punishment and verbal abuse. The primary culpability lies with Staff 1 for her abusive actions, though the facility's administration is also accountable for inadequate oversight and a recent prior similar violation.",
