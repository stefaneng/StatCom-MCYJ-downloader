    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation In the process of breaking up a fight, Staff 2 grabbed Youth T's\nthroat causing scratches and neck pain.\nInvestigation DCWL received this allegation reported by Complainant who is\nalso Calumet Staff.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI reviewed the incident report dated 11/2/23 by Supervisor 1. It\nwas noted Supervisor 1 was not present for the entire incident.\nThe report indicated Youth T got into a verbal altercation with her\npeer. Staff 1 attempted to verbally de-escalate the situation but\nwas unsuccessful. Youth T assaulted Staff 1 by striking her in the\nface. Staff 1 called for assistance and removed herself from the\nPod. Staff 2 and 3 arrived and put the youths in their rooms for\ntheir safety. Youth T kicked her peer’s door; Staff 2 and 3\nattempted to verbally deescalate Youth T but were unsuccessful.\nYouth T grabbed and pulled Staff 2’s braids. Supervisors 1 and 2\narrived to assist. Supervisor 1 verbally deescalated Youth T until\nshe released Staff 2’s hair. Youth T was examined by the nurse.\nI reviewed photos of Youth T’s neck taken by the Facility Nurse\non 11/3/23. Photos show 1” and ¼” superficial abrasions on her\nneck.\nI reviewed the medical assessment by Facility Nurse dated\n11/3/23. It indicated “Youth T reports neck pain…Per youth, ‘Staff\n2 grabbed me by the neck’…Youth reports Staff 2 scratched her\nneck and had her hands around the front of her neck and choked\nher. Youth then pulled Staff 2’s hair. Youth was then tripped and\npulled to the floor. Superficial abrasions obs (5) to anterior\nneck…neck xray (stat) ordered.”\n2",
    "I arrived at the facility on 11/07/23 accompanied by Government\nWorker 1 and viewed video footage. Video of the entire incident is\ndescribed below under additional findings.\nIn terms of the scratches on Youth T’s neck, the video does not\nshow Staff 2 grabbing her neck or choking her. It does, however,\nshow an unidentified staff standing behind and beside Youth T\nand wrapping her arm around the youth’s neck holding her for 5\nseconds. It is likely the neck scratches were unintentional but\noccurred as a result of improper restraint techniques (see\nadditional finding).\nGovernment Worker 1 interviewed Youth T on 11/03/23 before I\nwas assigned this investigation. Youth T reported she had been\nat the facility for one week and knew Supervisors 1 and 2 were\npresent but did not know the names of any other staff involved.\nYouth T told Government Worker 1 that one staff grabbed her\nfrom behind and scratched her neck with her fingernails, they fell\nto the floor and started fighting. She said her hand was sore\nbecause she may have punched a wall when swinging at staff.\nYouth T grabbed one staff by her hair. That same staff bent down\nand tried to loosen her grip on her hair. She and the staff were\nboth holding the staff’s hair tugging on it. The supervisors got her\noff the staff.\nGovernment Worker 1 observed three scratches. One was\napproximately 1 ½” and the other two were ½”. Youth T saw the\nnurse and denied any other injuries.\nGovernment Worker 1 requested to Director that Staff 2 not have\ncontact with Youth T until the investigation is completed.\nI interviewed Youth T at the facility on 11/7/23. She refused to\nanswer any questions because she said she already talked with\nGovernment Worker 1. “I’m sick of talking about it,” she explained\nand left the room.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. She has\nworked at the facility for six months and was last trained in\nphysical management in May 2023. Staff 2’s fingernails were\nsquared off and manicured with extensions. Asked if she\nscratched Youth T’s neck, she responded, “There’s no way\npossible I scratched Youth T. I was holding my own hair.”\nGovernment Worker 1 and I interviewed Staff 3 and Staff 4\nseparately. Both denied that Staff 2 scratched the youth’s neck or\n3",
    "held her throat. After the incident, neither staff saw any marks on\nYouth T.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 jointly with Government Worker 1.\nShe said she was present for the incident and was not aware of\nany injuries to Youth T.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis Photos of Youth T’s neck after the incident showed scratches.\nAll staff denied scratching Youth T’s neck or seeing another staff\nscratch her. Video also does not show the youth’s neck being\nscratched. The scratches on her neck were not a form of\npunishment but likely occurred as a result of improper restraint\ntechniques utilized by staff (as cited below).\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth’s\ntreatment plan.\nViolation Additional Finding of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff did not follow the procedures for Handle with Care.\nInvestigation Video of the Girl’s Detention Pod on 11/02/23 (3 min. duration)\nAll of the youths are in their rooms and five staff are with Youth T\nin the living area. Youth T lunges toward Staff 1, pushes her and\nreportedly hits her. From behind, another staff person utilizes the\nprimary restraint technique (PRT), pivots and moves Youth T in\nthe opposite direction for 3 seconds. Youth struggles, breaks free\nfrom the hold, walks back toward Staff 1 and kicks a door. Three\nstaff approach her from behind and attempt to restrain her. Youth\nT resists, drops her weight, and pulls and backs away from the\nstaff. Two staff approach her from the front and try to grab her\narms on either side. Youth T resists, drops her weight again and\n4",
    "lowers herself to the floor. The two staff initially release her. Then,\nrather than back away to safety, Staff 2 bends over and grabs\nboth of the youth’s arms while another staff holds her feet above\nthe floor. A third staff moves in and takes Youth T’s right arm.\nYouth T is still on the floor and the three staff stand over her\nholding her limbs for 2 seconds. At this time, it appears that Youth\nT grabs Staff 2’s braids and holds them for 10 seconds.\nSupervisor 1 and two more staff arrive on the pod. Several staff\nattempt to release the youth’s grip from Staff 2’s hair. After\nanother 12 seconds, Youth T finally releases the staff’s braids and\nremains on the floor, raising and kicking her legs. Five staff stand\nover her grabbing at her limbs. Youth T is on the floor for 64 more\nseconds but only her feet are in the camera’s view. One by one\nstaff leave the youth and come back into the camera’s view.\nYouth T stands up and walks back toward the staff who just\nreleased her. One staff blocks and holds her again, wraps her left\narm around the front of the youth’s neck from the side and holds\nher for 5 seconds. Youth T continues to jump, resist and kicks\nover a chair. After 40 more seconds of verbal intervention by\nstaff, she appears to deescalate.\nStaff 1 could not be interviewed. She was suspended from work\nfor attendance issues and did not respond to voice messages\nfrom Director.\nStaff 2 said she and Staff 4 responded to a call for assistance. “I\nsaw Youth S and T yelling at each other. We cleared the area.\nYouth T spazzed out and hit Staff 1 in the face with an open hand.\nYouth T acted irate, slipped on the floor, then came for me and\ngrabbed my hair. I leaned in toward her. She pulled me down by\nthe hair. I held my hair to keep it from being pulled out. Three\nbraids were torn out…I couldn’t see who was there to help. I\nstepped off the pod. Youth T was still yelling.”\nStaff 3 has worked at the facility for six months and was last\ntrained in physical management in May 2023. She reported “All\nthe youths were in their rooms and Youth T was yelling on the\npod. Staff stood around her. Youth T reached around staff and\nslapped Staff 1 on the side of her face. I was on one side and\nStaff 2 was on the other side. We were standing. Youth T\ngrabbed Staff 2’s hair. I tried to get the braids. Youth T fell. Staff\n2 was standing over her. Someone came and tried to help get the\nbraids loose.” Staff 3 denied holding one of Youth T’s arms and\ndenied that anyone was holding her feet as seen in the video.\n5",
    "Staff 4 has worked at the facility for six months and was last\ntrained in physical management in April 2023. She said she left\nthe pod after all the residents except Youth T were in their rooms.\nWhen she returned, she saw Youth T on the floor kicking and\npulling Staff 2’s hair. “Staff 3 untangled Youth T’s hands and\nYouth T sat on the floor.” Including herself, Staff 4 said there were\nfive direct care staff and three supervisors “around” Youth T.\nHowever, she did not hear any supervisor directing the staff what\nto do or not to do.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 jointly with Government Worker 1.\nShe has worked at the facility for five years and was last trained in\nphysical management in March 2023. When she arrived on the\npod, Supervisor 1 said Youth T had Staff 2’s hair in her hand.\nYouth T was on the floor with Staff 2 standing over her. “I was\nverbally deescalating and used a defensive move to release Youth\nT’s hand. I had Staff 2 step off the pod. Me and Supervisor 2\ndeescalated Youth T. She apologized to me. We have not let\nStaff 2 work with Youth T.”\nSupervisor 2 has worked at the facility for one year and was last\ntrained in physical management in March 2023. She said she and\nSupervisor 1 arrived on the pod and tried to release Youth T’s grip\nfrom Staff 2’s hair. “Staff 2 was on the bottom and Youth T was\non top of her. Youth T had two hands full of braids. Staff 3 was\nalso trying to stop Youth T verbally. Staff 3, Supervisor 1 and I\ndidn’t touch Youth T. She was enraged.”\nI reviewed the facility’s Handle with Care instruction manual.\nHolding a youth’s arms and/or feet from a standing position while\nthe youth lie on her back and wrapping an arm around a youth’s\nneck while standing are not approved techniques.\nAnalysis Video shows improper physical restraint techniques were used.\nStaff held a youth’s arms and feet from a standing position while\nthe youth lie on her back and then while standing one staff\nwrapped her arm around the front of the youth’s neck, which are\nnot approved Handle with Care techniques.\nCONSULTATION\nStaff call supervisor(s) when the need to physically restrain a\nyouth is anticipated or in progress. Once supervisor(s) arrive,\ntheir primary role is to coach and direct the staff, which includes\nassuring physical restraint(s) are justified and executed properly.\n6",
    "Once Youth T lowered herself to the floor, staff should have\nbacked away to a safe distance. They should not have reengaged\nor held her arms or feet. Then after Youth T stood up and\nreapproached staff aggressively, staff should have initiated a two-\nperson control hold or primary restraint technique and should not\nhave wrapped her arm around the front of the youth’s neck.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2022C0207019 intake 1/31/22; CAP approved 3/29/22\n2022C0108014 intake 2/17/22; CAP approved 3/16/22\n2022C0446034 intake 7/14/22; CAP approved 8/29/22\n2022C0108032 intake 7/29/22; CAP approved 8/30/22\nRule Code & Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (1) A childcaring institution, including private secure juvenile\njustice facilities, shall establish a process improvement and\nrestraint reduction/elimination plan that:\n(a) Includes documentation of each restraint.\nViolation Additional Finding of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The incident report does not include documentation of each\nrestraint (proper or improper).\nInvestigation Video footage shows Youth T’s free movement was restricted in at\nleast three instances. One staff used a primary restraint\ntechnique (PRT), three held her arms and feet while she was on\nthe floor, and another wrapped her arm around the youth’s neck\nfrom a standing position. These restraints were not reflected in\nthe incident report by Supervisor 1.\nI reviewed the facility’s Unusual and Critical Incidents Policy. It\nindicates the facility manager or supervisor writes an incident\nreport summarizing written statements from staff who were\ninvolved or who witnessed the incident.\nAnalysis The report written by Supervisor 1 focused on Youth T’s behaviors\nand verbal interventions by staff but did not include three\ninstances where staff restricted her free movement (physical\nrestraint).\nCONSULTATION\nThe difficulty of accurately describing long and complicated\nincidents involving eight staff is acknowledged. However, written\n7",
    "statements from staff used by supervisors to summarize an event\nmust include the actions displayed by both the youth(s) and the\nstaff. All points of physical contact between staff and youth should\nbe identified to determine if one or more restraints (restriction of\nthe youth’s movement) occurred, and if the restraints were\njustified and executed properly according to Handle with Care\nprotocol.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2022C0207019 intake 1/31/22; CAP approved 3/29/22\n2022C0108014 intake 2/17/22; CAP approved 3/16/22\n2022C0446034 intake 7/14/22; CAP approved 8/29/22\n2022C0108032 intake 7/29/22; CAP approved 8/30/22\nRule Code & Rule 400.4150 Incident reporting\nSection (1) Any incident resulting in serious injury of a resident or illness\nDescription requiring inpatient hospitalization, shall be reported to the parent/\nlegal guardian, responsible referring agency, and the licensing\nauthority as soon as possible, but not more than 24 hours after the\nincident.\n(2) The death of a resident shall be reported immediately to the\nparent/legal guardian or next of kin, law enforcement, the licensing\nauthority, and the referring agency.\n(3) If an institution determines that a youth is absent without legal\npermission, then the institution shall immediately report the\ninformation to law enforcement, the parent/ legal guardian or next\nof kin, the licensing authority, and the referring agency.\n(4) When a resident’s behavior results in contact with law\nenforcement, the incident shall be reported to the parent/legal\nguardian, responsible referring agency, and the licensing authority\nas soon as possible, but not more than 24 hours after the incident.\nViolation Additional Finding of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The facility’s Unusual and Critical Incident Reporting Policy (Rule\n400.4150) is inconsistent with the reporting timeframes required\nby the rule and does not include notification to parents/guardians.\n8",
    "Investigation The facility’s Unusual and Critical Incident reporting policy is\nconfusing and insufficient. It combines internal incident report\nwriting and approval processes with verbal/written notifications to\nexternal sources, i.e. referral sources and licensing.\nIn terms of the internal incident report writing process, the policy\nallows staff to complete and provide written witness statements to\nthe Supervisor or Facility Manager by the end of their shift (which\ncould be up to 12 hours after the event). Then the Supervisor or\nFacility Manager gathers all of the written statements, summarizes\nthem, and writes one incident report. By the “next office day”, the\nCenter Director reviews and signs the report. Including\nweekends, holidays, and other days off, the “next office day” could\nbe up to 5 days after the actual event took place.\nIn terms of external notifications, the policy indicates if the incident\nmeets the criteria for reporting to outside sources, the Supervisor\nimmediately informs the Facility Manager and Center Director.\nIncidents requiring external notifications trigger “procedures\noutlined in steps H-J,” but there were no such “procedures” found\nin this policy. Within 24 hours of the Center Director “being\nnotified” of the event, Center Director ensures the notifications and\nthe written incident reports are forwarded to licensing and referral\nsources “within the timeframes established by those agencies.”\nThe licensing rules says notifications are to be immediate or within\nno more than 24 hours of the actual event, not within 24 hours of\nthe Center Director becoming aware of the event. The policy also\ndoes not address how parents/guardians are notified.\nAnalysis The facility’s procedures for notifying external sources of events\nlisted in Rule 400.4150 needs to be revised so it is consistent with\nthe rule.\nCONSULTATION\nIn addition to revising procedures for notifying external sources, I\nrecommend the facility’s internal incident report writing and\napproval process be revised and written on a separate document.\nConclusion Violation Established\n9",
    "Rule Code & Rule 400.4163 Health status assessment; notification;\nSection debriefing; reporting.\nDescription (1) The agency shall develop and implement written procedures\nfor health status screening, notifications, debriefing, and reporting\nwhen a restraint, including an emergency restraint, or seclusion is\nused.\nViolation Additional Finding of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The agency did not develop and implement written procedures to\nfacilitate compliance with this rule since it came into effect in May\n2022.\nInvestigation I requested written procedures pertaining to compliance with this\nrule and the agency was unable to provide it.\nAnalysis The agency failed to develop and implement written procedures\nfor health status screening, notifications, debriefing, and reporting\nwhen a restraint, including an emergency restraint, or seclusion is\nused.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nNovember 29, 2023\n_______________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 29, 2023\n____________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n10"
