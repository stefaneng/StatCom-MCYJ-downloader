    "Personnel records\nI reviewed Staff person 1, 2, 3 and 4’s personnel file on 07/28/2020. None contained\ndiscipline issues related to this complaint.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nANALYSIS: Staff person 1 facilitated Resident A’s intake in a straightforward\nmanner. Although Staff person 2, 3 and 4 denied speaking\nloudly and using profanity while in the multipurpose room it was\nheard by Staff person 1, Resident A and Department of Health\nand Human Service worker 1 and 2. It is found that Resident A’s\nintake was not completed in a desirable setting. Staff also serve\nas role models and the use of appropriate language is expected\non facility grounds.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRepeat Violation\n2019C0325054\nCorrective action plan approved 10/23/2019\nRepeat Violation\n2019C0325030\nCorrective action plan approved 05/07/2019\nALLEGATION:\nResident A was not permitted to keep and wear his personal clothing at Clarence\nFischer Center.\nINVESTIGATION:\nResident A\nI interviewed Resident A in person on 07/28/2020.

    "Department of Health and Human Service worker 1 and 2\nI interviewed Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) worker 1 by\ntelephone on 07/22/2020.

It is not a licensing or contractual violation\nfor a facility to provide residents a uniform like wardrobe in place\nof his personal clothing.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDING:\nINVESTIGATION:\nStaff person 1\nI interviewed Staff person 1 in person on 07/28/2020.

Staff person 1 stated he was trained to\nfacilitate a resident’s intake when he became a Safety and Security Team staff\nperson.\nPersonnel file\nI reviewed Staff person 1’s personnel file on 07/28/2020. Staff person 1 became a\nSafety Security Team staff person in 03/2020. The Safety Security Team job\ndescription does not list intakes but includes the responsibility of “task and duties are\nsubject to change to meet the needs of program.” Staff person 1’s training\ndocumentation does not show Staff person 1 completed Safety Security Team\ntraining or intake training.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 499.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(1) The licensee shall provide an orientation program for new\nemployees. Job shadowing shall not be the only form of\norientation.\nANALYSIS: Staff person 1 became a Safety and Security Team staff person\nin 03/2020. Staff person 1’s training documentation does not\nsupport he was trained in his new job as a Safety and Security\nTeam staff person and trained to facilitate intakes. It is found\nthat Staff person 1 was not provided orientation in his new\nposition as a Safety and Security Team staff person and how to\nfacilitate intakes.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nThe continuance of a regular license is recommended for Clarence Fischer Center\nupon receipt of an approved corrective action plan.\n08/12/2020\n________________________________________\nVivian D.
