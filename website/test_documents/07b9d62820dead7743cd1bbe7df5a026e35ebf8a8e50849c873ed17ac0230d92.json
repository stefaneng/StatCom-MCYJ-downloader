It was reported that youth was\ndenied entry due to his possession of a ski-mask which was\nassessed as “contraband”. After the review of the AWOL policy, it\nfailed to identify this process, and the agency does not have a\nworking definition of contraband in its policy and procedures that\nwould support the decision of the staff to not allow the youth entry\ninto the facility. Although several interviews of both staff and\nyouth denied knowledge of residents not being allowed entry after\n10",
    "being AWOL, the interview of Supervisor 2 confirmed failure to\nallow Youth A entry when he returned from AWOL as it was\nassessed that he possessed contraband.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nIV.

    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted at the Wolverine Center following allegations that a youth (Youth A) was physically abused by staff and sustained bruises and a swollen face. The investigation, which included interviews and document reviews, found no evidence to substantiate the claims of physical punishment or improper intervention by staff. However, the investigation did confirm that the facility failed to ensure the youth's safety and protection when a supervisor denied him re-entry to the building after an AWOL incident because he was wearing a ski mask, which was deemed 'contraband' despite no policy defining that term. While the facility was cleared of the abuse allegations, the report places culpability for the safety violation squarely on the agency for its failure to have and follow clear policies regarding re-admission and contraband.",
