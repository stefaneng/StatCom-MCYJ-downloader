I reviewed the details of the complaint with Foster\nParent X, which indicated the case worker and licensing worker\nhad threatened and harassed her and her husband around issues\nwith their foster children’s biological parent’s visitations. It was\nreported this threat happened via a written text on 2/28/2024 but\nhas also happened a few other times in the last two months.\nAdditionally, the Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) and the licensing\nworker know about this threat. The foster parents have gone up\nthe chain of command to complain about the case worker’s\nbehavior.\nFoster Parent X reported this involves Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) 3, not the licensing worker. She reported her\nlicensing worker, Certification Worker (CW) 2 and the children’s\nGAL know that FCW 3 threatened them. She reported FCW 3 is\nthe fifth case worker for Child A and Child B whom they have\n2",
    "fostered since 2020 and 2021 respectively. She reported the\nchildren’s case had been moving toward termination prior to FCW\n3’s assignment to the case. A petition for permanent custody had\noccurred, they were all awaiting permanent custody, but birth\nparent and sibling visitations were still occurring. She said her and\nher husband have been working with the agency around the\nscheduling of these visits. She denied ever not cooperating with\nthe children’s visitations and reported the birth mother and the\ndifferent fathers have consistently missed these visitations. She\nreported visitations in December 2023 were not occurring. Those\nvisits were assumed cancelled due to the birth parents not\nconfirming the visit 24 hours before the scheduled visit was to\noccur, as had been the agreement by the worker/the agency.\nFoster Parent X reported, recently the birth mother wanted the\nvisitation to occur on Saturday, which is difficult for Foster Parent\nX, but she had been able to handle it for the past two months.\nShe reported since termination was originally supposed to occur\non 2/27/2024, she told FCW 3 she could not make the 10am-12\nnoon Saturday visits due to a standing 10am appointment Foster\nParent X has on Saturday. Foster Parent X suggested an\nalternative Saturday visitation time of 8am-10am, and FCW 3\nchecked with the other parties on that alternative time. The\nvisitation alternative time change was denied by the birth mother\nand the relative who cares for Child A’s and Child B’s two other\nsiblings. Foster Parent X said she then asked whether the\nvisitation for the birth mother could occur on a weekday, a\nMonday- Friday afternoon for 3:30pm-5:30pm. Additionally, she\nasked that they do sibling visitations once a month on Saturday\naround noon, as opposed to weekly (the times the birth parent\ndoes not show for the parenting time). Foster Parent X reported\nher suggestions were not agreed on. She said, it was after she\nwas not committing to the original Saturday visit time that she\nreceived a text message from FCW 3 threatening to open up a\nspecial investigation on their foster home and removing Child A\nand Child B from their care if she does not comply. Foster Parent\nX reported there were two other times where she felt FCW 3 was\neither displaying harassing behavior toward her or being\nunprofessional in FCW 3’s demeanor. These were via a text\nmessage on 12/5/2023 and 1/19/2024. She reported, FCW 3 was\nindicating Foster Parent X was violating licensing rules, but it was\nthe birth parents missing the visits not them. Foster Parent X\nadmitted those text messages may not have been actual threats,\nbut she perceived them as unprofessional and disrespectful.\nFoster Parent X also admitted FCW 3 has never been verbally\n3",
    "disrespectful to her or her husband. Nor has FCW 3 been\nphysically threatening to either of them.\nFoster Parent X reported calling Supervisor 1 about the 2/28/2024\ntext message from FCW 3. She left Supervisor 1 a message, but\nnever received a call back. She also contacted CW 2 with\nconcern about this alleged threat. During the call with CW 2, she\nheard FCW 3 coming in yelling “What is her problem with me”;\nand saying, “I would leave early from visitations”. Foster Parent X\nreported the latter was not true.\nFoster Parent X reported she also called GAL 4 and provided him\na copy of the text message from FCW 3. Foster Parent X\nadmitted she never reached out to the agency’s director, or a\nhigher-level administrator about her concerns about the text\nmessages or with FCW 3.\nOn 3/12/2024 I interviewed Supervisor 1 by telephone.\nSupervisor 1 admitted the case is approaching termination; and\nparent visitations are still scheduled. She explained a hearing\nrelated to parental rights termination was to occur on 3/14/2024\nand was adjourned to 4/2/2024. These delays likely\ncaused worry for the foster parents. She denied hearing or\nobserving FCW 3 to be threatening or unprofessional in her\ndemeanor to Foster Parent X. Nor had she received any prior\ncontacts from Foster Parent X alleging such by FCW 3. She said\nwhen she missed Foster Parent X’s telephone call on 2/28/2024\nshe assumed the call was for that reason, as Foster Parent X had\nalso contacted CW 2 about the text message.\nSupervisor 1 reported she is aware that Foster Parent X was\nfrustrated with parenting times. The parenting visits for the birth\nmother were occurring on Saturday in the community. The\nagreement was if the birth parent did not attend the visit, that visit\nwas to turn into a sibling visitation, and everyone had been okay\nwith that. Then on or about 2/28/2024, after the time had already\nbeen worked out for the parenting visits, Foster Parent X wanted\nto move the visiting time. Supervisor 1 said she was not a part of\nthe scheduling conversation for those, but it was reported Foster\nParent X wanted to move the visit to a weekday and was not\nwilling to work with the birth mother’s schedule. Supervisor 1\nreported up until this incident in February 2024, Foster Parent X\nhad been participating and cooperating with the visitation. As the\ncase grew close to termination Foster Parent X had been\ncomplaining and indicated she was ready for it to be over.\n4",
    "Supervisor 1 admitted to seeing the alleged threatening text\nmessage. She said the message indicated if Foster Parent X was\nnot willing to comply with parenting time we may have to open a\nspecial evaluation or look at moving the children. She said, FCW\n3 and another certification worker (Certification 6), came to her\nand reported Foster Parent X was complaining and had been\ndifficult with parenting time in the past. Supervisor 1 advised\nthose workers if what they said was true then it would be\nappropriate to inform Foster Parent X in such a manner as FCW 3\ndid. Supervisor 1 reported Program Manager 5 also told her what\nhad been reported about Foster Parent X was accurate.\nSupervisor 1 admitted there is no plan or desire to replace Child A\nand Child B from Foster Parent X’s home. She denied the purpose\nof FCW 3’s text statement was to threaten and frighten the foster\nparents with removal of the children. She stated it was appropriate\nbecause the agency does not know what will happen around the\nchildren’s parent’s rights being termination.\nAside from CW 2, Supervisor 1 was not aware of Foster Parent X\ncontacting any other agency staff or administrator to complain\nabout FCW 3’s behavior. She said Foster Parent X would contact\nCW 2 to try to get things changed to the way Foster Parent X\nwanted.\nOn 3/12/2024 I interviewed Certification Worker 2 (CW 2) by\ntelephone. She reported she had a working relationship with FCW\n3 and the foster parents. She admitted an awareness of the text\nmessage this complaint speaks of, but not its full details. She said\nthe text was just reminding Foster Parent X they have to be\navailable for the visits and stay the whole time. She later said\nFCW 3 read the text message to her after FCW 3 sent it. She\nreported the latter occurring after she received a call from Foster\nParent X who was upset about the text message, and reported it\nstated if she did not follow the rule then they would open a special\nevaluation and remove the children. CW 2 said she “did not recall\nthe part about removing the children; or it being said, if they don’t\nthen we’ll remove the children”.\nCW 2 said both Foster Parent X and FCW 3 were frustrated\naround issues pertaining to the foster children’s visitations. She\nsaid Foster Parent X would call her when things wouldn’t go\nFoster Parent X’s way, and CW 2 would mediate and assist with\ngetting things worked out. Foster Parent X had also called her a\ncouple of times with frustrations about the foster children’s parents\ncancelling visits at the last minute, or not confirming visits.\n5",
    "Additionally, Foster Parent X had reported concerns about sibling\nvisits being conjoined on Saturdays with parenting time and when\nthe birth parent didn’t show they had to schedule a different time.\nCW 2 said FCW 3 had to make a lot of contacts to get visits set up\nand FCW 3 was also irritated about how difficult things were\naround the visitation issues. Aside from observing those\nfrustrations by FCW 3, CW 2 denied witnessing or having any\nawareness of FCW 3 threatening, harassing or being\nunprofessional to/with Foster Parent X, or Foster Parent X’s\nhusband.\nCW 2 acknowledged FCW 3 came to her office during a time\nFoster Parent X was talking with her about the alleged text\nmessage. FCW 3 was upset and made a statement to the effect\n“What did I do to make her mad.” FCW 3 was just asking a\nquestion, not talking about the foster parent. CW 2 advised FCW 3\nto leave her office and CW 2 finished her conservation with Foster\nParent X. She was then able to assist in getting the Saturday\nvisitation schedule worked out.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 3 (FCW 3) about this complaint\nvia telephone on 3/14/2024. FCW 3 reported being assigned to\nChild A’s and Child B’s case for the last eight months. She said\nwhen she first received the case, Foster Parent X said the parents\nwere always cancelling visits and asked if the agency could agree\nto a 24-hour confirmation for visits. Meaning that if the birth\nparents did not call to confirm the visit within 24 hours of the set\nvisit, it would be assumed the visit was cancelled. She said,\nvisitation for the children’s birth mother were less complicated\nearlier when the birth mother lived with the relative that has the\nother two siblings. After the birth mother moved, FCW 3 and the\nagency had to readjust visits. She said at first Foster Parent X was\nagreeing to any parenting time, because most of the time the birth\nmother was not confirming them, and Foster Parent X believed the\nvisit would just get cancelled. FCW 3 reported, around November\nor December of 2023, everyone agreed to the birth mother’s\nparenting time occurring on Saturday from 10am -12 noon. If the\nbirth parent did not confirm the visit, that visit would then be a\nsibling visit. FCW 3 said two such sibling visits occurred that way.\nOn the third visit, after the parent had not confirmed, the siblings\ncaregiver called to reported Foster Parent X cancelled the sibling\nvisitation. FCW 3 contacted Foster Parent X on the relative\ncaregiver’s behalf and Foster Parent X asked why they needed to\ndo sibling visits weekly when they are not required weekly. Foster\nParent X reported having another commitment for the reported\n6",
    "Saturday visit and she would not be moving forward with the\nsibling visit. FCW 3 said she was texting back and forth with\nFoster Parent X. She said she received an email from the GAL\nalleging she was trying to force weekly sibling visits, when\nparenting visits should be weekly, and sibling visit monthly. FCW\n3 explained since the children do not see each other often, she\nbelieved if the birth parents do not show up, why not use that\nopportunity for the siblings to visit. FCW 3 tried to get Foster\nParent X to understand this. FCW 3 reported, in an effort to work\nthrough issues, another plan was agreed to at an FTM. There\nwould be two different Friday visits and two Saturday visits, all to\noccur pending the children 2/29/2024 court hearing, where they\nthought visitation issues would end, as parental rights termination\nwould occur.\nFCW 3 reported the new plan, (as mentioned above) was working.\nThen a week before the 2/29/2024 court hearing the agency was\nadvised by the Attorney General to pull the permanent custody\npetition, and visitation scheduling became a problem. FCW 3 said\nshe explained the permanent custody petition situation to\neveryone on or about 2/27/024. She also spoke with Foster Parent\nX again about a need to reschedule visitation for the birth mother\nand the siblings. She knew Saturdays didn’t work for Foster\nParent X due to Foster Parent X’s personal commitment, and so\nthe birth mother and relative caregiver agreed to have visits on\nFriday. Then Foster Parent X reported no weekday during the day\nworked for her. Foster Parent X gave no explanation as to why\nnot. Foster Parent X said she could do an evening, which did not\nwork for the birth mother. Foster Parent X proposed an earlier\ntime (8am-10am) on Saturday, but the relative caregiver and the\nbirth mother declined that proposed time due their schedules.\nFCW 3 said Foster Parent X kept bringing up issues, so FCW 3\nmade the decision to keep the visits on Saturday at 10am,\nbecause she felt Foster Parent X was being difficult. FCW 3 said\nshe spoke with her supervisor and a licensing person about Foster\nParent X not being cooperative around the visits. Those staff\nadvised her it would be appropriate to let Foster Parent X know if\nFoster Parent X did not cooperate with the case plan what could\nhappen. That was how the 2/28/2024 text message she sent to\nFoster Parent X came to be. Her text was advising Foster Parent\nX that if Foster Parent X did not cooperate the agency would open\nup a special evaluation and would remove the children. FCW said\nshe is a newer worker, and she was relying on the advice of her\nsupervisor and the licensing staff. She showed the text to them\nbefore she sent it.\n7",
    "FCW 3 reported understanding Foster Parent X’s frustration with\nvisits and in retrospect is able to see how her 2/28/2024 text\nmessage could be seen by Foster Parent X as a threat. She\nstated since the agency’s licensing department had advised her\nwhat to say she assumed it was correct. She admitted the text\nwas meant to get the foster parent to comply, but not to harass or\nthreaten the foster parent. She denied being disrespectful or\nunprofessional with the foster parents. She admitted despite what\nhad occurred with the recent visitation difficulties, Foster Parent X\nhad not refused visits or missed visits in the past. She said Foster\nParent X has given her push back but has, for the most part,\ncomplied.\nOn 3/14/2024 I spoke with GAL 4. GAL 4 reported the foster\nparents are upset about the situation around parenting time visits\nand scheduling given that parental rights termination is going to\noccur. GAL 4 reported the foster parents are frustrated, because\nit seems FCW 3 wants to bend over backward to accommodate\nthe birth parent for a Saturday visit when the foster parent has\nanother commitment on Saturday and is free all week. GAL 4\nreported agreeing with the foster parent’s frustration, but reported\nhe was not aware of any physical threats by FCW 3. He recalled\nseeing a text message from FCW 3 that if the foster parent does\nnot cooperate the worker will remove the children.\nDocumentation Review:\nChild A’s and Child B’s MISACWIC case record which showed:\n• The children are temporary court wards.\n• Child A was placed in Foster Parent X’s and her husband’s\nfoster home on 9/11/2020; and Child B on 12/1/2021.\n• FCW 3 was assigned to the children’s case in September\n2024.\n• A 9/12/2023-12/8/2023 updated service plan, and social\nwork contacts which showed Foster Parent X was working\nwith FCW 3 to negotiate on parenting and sibling visitation\ntimes and locations for the children.\n• Documentation of numerous cancelled visits or no shows\nby the birth fathers and the birth mother.\nText message thread between Foster Parent X and FCW 3:\n• Foster Parent X confirmed a visit for the next day, while\nalso advising FCW 3 that as of the next week and onward\nthe time for visits will be changing because the current time\nno longer works for her, but evenings after 3pm with the\nexception of Thursdays do work.\n8",
    "• FCW 3 responded by asking why the time that was\ndecided on no longer worked.\n• Foster Parent X responded: “It no longer works with our\nweekend and upcoming events”.\n• FCW replied “right you said that. But I am asking for more\ndetail.”\n• Foster Parent X then responded: “Upcoming medical\nappointment.”\nA 2/28/2024 text message from FCW 3 to Foster Parent X at\n12:46pm that indicated:\n• “The birth mother and relative caregiver are able to make\nSaturdays at 10am work, as originally discussed.”\n• “We change the visits so frequently and it is hard to keep\nchanging the times and days for something that needs to\nhappen weekly,\n• “The consist rescheduling is hurting this case more than\nanything, I understand everyone has a life, I understand\neveryone has “busy” days, but you are the only one that\nconstantly gives me push back. I understand you have\nobligations, but I am respectfully asking that you plan your\nobligations around our parenting time or I will look into a\nspecial evaluation or moving the children to a different\nhome.”\nAnalysis The interviews and documentation showed there was a great deal\nof frustration around visitation both by the foster parents and FCW\n3. Those frustrations and a perceived lack of cooperation by the\nfoster parent, lead to FCW 3 sending a text message to Foster\nParent X intended to get Foster Parent X to comply as a foster\nparent.\nTechnically Assistance.\nFCW 3 would benefit from additional education and training on\nengaging and working with foster parents/caregivers. As well as\nhow to develop strategies toward cooperation without resorting to\nwritten threats during challenging times.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing rules and statutes.\n9",
