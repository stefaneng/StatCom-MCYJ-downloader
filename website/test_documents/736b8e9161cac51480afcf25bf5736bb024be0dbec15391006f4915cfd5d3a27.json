INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nand able to meet the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that Staff 1 an IL staff person failed to intervene and\nprotect Youth A from other youths who were assaulting Youth A.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 8/4/2025 Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)\nWorker and I interviewed Youth A on the porch at her current\nLakewood Independent living (IL) placement. Youth A reported\nengaging in a physical altercation with other youths on two\noccasion on the same day one day last week. Youth A did not\nrecall the exact day of the incident. She described the chain of\nevents that day. She reported that the first incident occurred\nearlier in the day, while at a school location where she and other\nIL youths were assigned to work, but no staff were present. She\nreported having a bruise on her face and the back of her neck\nfrom that incident, but stated those marks are gone now. She\ndenied the police being called about that altercation or her\nshowing the bruise to the Program Director (PD), or another staff;\nnor that the PD asked her about the fight at the school.\nYouth A reported once she and the other youths were back at the\nIL house, Youth B came to her room upset over something, called\n2",
    "her a bitch and left. Youth A said she followed Youth B\ndownstairs. She reported Staff 1, who was the staff on shift at the\ntime, told her, Youth B and Youth C to let their feelings about what\nhad transpired between them earlier go. Staff 1 told them if they\nstarted fighting she was not going to break it up. Additionally,\nStaff 1 told Youth A that Youth A had been attacking everyone\nverbally. Youth A reported not knowing what Staff 1 meant by that\nremark. She asked Staff 1 to explain, but Youth D responded\ninstead. Youth D told her that she had been disrespectful to the\nstaff; “was always starting shit”; and Youth D “stepped to me”.\nYouth A said she pushed Youth D back and the two of them\nstarted fighting. Youth A said Youth C jumped into the fight by\ngrabbing her; and Youth C and Youth D were tag teaming her in\nthe fight. Youth A said Youth D also threatened that if Youth A did\nnot let her go, Youth D would punch her. She said Youth C got her\nin a choke hold, while they were on the floor, but she was able to\nget free; and she got up from the floor. Youth A reported thereon,\nYouth C and Youth D went into Youth D’s room. Youth A reported\ngoing to Youth D’s door, banging on it, trying to get in because\nshe was still upset. She said Staff 1 was still present in the home.\nStaff 1 told her to get away from Youth D’s door. Youth A\nreported that Staff 1 stated, “She must want her ass kicked again”,\nreferring to Youth A. Youth A reported Youth C and Youth D\ngrabbed her and were punching her again. They got her to the\nfloor; but she was able to kick them. She also threw a mop head\nas Youth D was going out the door; but Youth D made it out the\ndoor. She tried also to grab someone’s purse to throw but Youth\nE told her not to threw it. Youth A did not report where Youth E\nhad been previously; as Youth’s A reporting on the chain of\nactions happening was not consistently cohesive. As Youth A\nalso reported being put in a choke hold by Youth E and that they\nwere outside. It was not clear from Youth A’s statement when they\ngot outside and whether the choke hold happened inside or\noutside. Youth A did not state where Staff 1 was during this\nincident.\nYouth A reported she was able to hit Youth E with a stick, but\nYouth E was able to get the stick and was hitting her with it. While\nthis incident was happening with Youth E, Youth A said Youth C\nand Youth D were sitting on the porch cheering Youth E on calling\nYouth E the “Queen” and telling Youth E to get her. Youth A\nreported at some point she saw a cop and the cop tackled her and\nYouth E, but during that process she pulled Youth E’s hair. She\nsaid Staff 1 also reported Youth E was pregnant and so Youth E\nyelled “If you kill my baby, I’m going to kill you”. Youth A reported\nthat the police put her in the car and initially told her they were\n3",
    "going to charge her. Youth A believed that was because Youth C,\nYouth D had reported things in Youth E’s favor and because\nYouth E is pregnant.\nYouth A reported that the police took her to the hospital, but she\nwas later released to the Community Care Organization staff. She\nsaid she was moved from the Lansdowne IL home where the fight\noccurred. She was placed at the agency’s Lakewood IL home. As\nto how the police got on the scene, Youth A said Staff 1 had told\nthem if they fought she would not break it up; she would call the\npolice. But Youth A stated she believes the neighbor called the\npolice.\nOn 8/13/2025, I interviewed Youth B with DHHS Worker at\nLansdown’s IL home. Youth B acknowledged that she and Youth\nA got into a physical altercation at a landscaping job they were at\nearlier in the day a couple of weeks ago. She said no police were\ninvolved and no staff were present. She did not have any bruises\nfrom the incident. She was not sure whether Youth A had any\nmarks or bruises. She said when they got back to the Lansdown\nIL home Staff 1 told them to let go of what had happened earlier;\nto not make it worst by bringing that situation back up.\nYouth B said she did not see how the fight started with Youth A\nand Youth E, because she had gone to the store. She said when\nshe returned she saw Youth A and Youth E on the ground across\nthe street from the IL home. The fight had ended, and the police\nwas present. Youth B reported with respect to the physical\nincident that had occurred in the house earlier, Staff 1 did not\nencourage she and Youth C to fight Youth A, and told them to\nstop fighting. As to who called the police that day, Youth B was\nnot certain. She thought it may have been Staff 2 because before\nYouth B left for the store, she saw Youth A push Staff 1 into a\nwall. Though Youth B did not report Staff 2 being the staff on shift.\nOn 8/13/2025 DHHS Worker and I interviewed Neighbor Man\n(NM) outside his home. NM’s home is across the street from the\nLansdown IL house, and he was listed in the police report as a\nwitness. NM acknowledged witnessing a fight between two\nyouths. He reported the Big Girl” (whom we determined to be\nYouth E) kept telling the “Little Girl” (whom we determined to be\nYouth A) to leave and to stop. NM described Youth A as the\naggressor. NM reported that Youth A picked up a stick and was\nhitting Youth E with it while Youth E kept telling Youth A to stop\nand to go. Then Youth E got the stick from Youth A and was\nhitting Youth A with it. NM said when the police arrived, they put\n4",
    "handcuffs on Youth A. NM was asked whether he observed a staff\nperson at the IL home on the scene. NM reported observing a\nwoman whom he surmised was the staff person. He said, “she\nwas standing around; she looked like she was scared”. NM said\nthe staff person was not doing anything. He did not observe the\nstaff to encourage or push the two youths to fight.\nOn 8/20/2025 during a telephone call with DHHS Worker, she\nreported having a telephone contact with Youth E whom we had\ntried to contact on 8/13/2025. She reported that Youth E had\nconfirmed information reported by Youth A related to Youth A\npicking up a purse and throwing it. Youth E reported the purse\nwas hers and she had told Youth A not to throw it, but Youth A\nignored her. Youth E reported after Youth A ignored her about\nthrowing the purse, they had a physical altercation. Youth E\nreported putting Youth A in a headlock and dragging Youth A\noutside; and the two of them fighting outside. DHHS Worker said\nYouth E reported Staff 1 was not outside when she and Youth A\nwere fighting. Additionally, DHHS Worker said Youth E told her\nwhen Youth A, Youth C and Youth D were involved in the physical\naltercation inside the IL house, Staff 1 was telling them to stop;\nand so was Youth E.\nOn 8/25/2025 I interviewed Youth E by telephone. She reported\nnot being present for the incident between Youth A, and other\nyouths at the job site. She confirmed information as reported by\nDHHS Worker. She clarified as it pertained to the fight between\nYouth A and other youths at the house, Case Manager had called\nStaff 1 while she was in the car with Staff 1 to say the girls were\narguing and fighting. Case Manager reported she needed to\nleave; that she was “too old for this shit”. Youth E reported Youth\nA had been arguing or trying to start stuff with different girls all\nday. Youth E said when Youth A and Youth D began to fight,\nYouth C jumped in. Youth E said Staff 1 was telling them not to\nfight, and to stop fighting. Youth E said Staff 1 also tried to help\nher break up the fight, because Youth C and Youth D were\nbeating up Youth A. She said Staff 1 trying to break up the fight is\nhow Staff 1 broke her nail. Youth E reported then Youth C, Youth\nD and Youth A went into a bedroom and Youth C and Youth D\nwere beating Youth A up again. Youth E reported she and Staff 1\ngot the girls separated again. She reported that after the latter\nevent, they went into the living room and that’s when Youth A\ngrabbed her purse and threw it at her. Youth E said she put Youth\nA into a headlock and took Youth A outside. While outside Youth\nA picked up a stick and hit her with it. Youth E said she really did\nnot want to fight Youth A, that she was telling Youth A to stop, but\n5",
    "Youth A would not. Youth E reported while in the house Staff 1\nwas trying to deescalate the situation. She said Staff 1 called the\npolice when they were in the living room, but it took a long while\nfor the police to get there. Youth E was not sure what more Staff 1\ncould have done.\nOn 8/25/2025 I interviewed Program Director (PD) with DHHS\nWorker at the agency’s office in Eastpointe Michigan. PD\nreported the incident occurred on 7/28/2025. She reported it was\nwhat was told to her by youths, but more actually what she saw on\nvideo of the incident led her to self-report the complaint. She said\nshe saw Staff 1 moving furniture out of the way when the youths\nwere fighting, and Staff 1 was not trying to de-escalate the\nsituation. Nor was Staff 1 seen quickly calling the police. PD\nreported the agency’s protocol related to this type of physical\nincident is staff will not try to break up a fight but will immediately\ncall the police; and will send a special text code in the staff group\nchat, (the special code, is meant for staff to come the house)\ngroup chat. PD reported Staff 1 had sent a text that afternoon,\nindicating Doctor Brown (the code) but then replied back that it\nwas a typo. Staff 1 never called or texted to say there was a\nproblem at the house, that the girls were fighting or that Staff 1\nneeded assistance. PD reported Staff 1 was suspended pending\nthe departmental investigation, but at this point, she does not\nforesee the agency reinstating Staff 1. PD provided DHHS\nWorker and I a copy of the videos she had.\nOn 8/25/2025, I interviewed Staff 1 at the agency’s Eastpointe,\nMichigan office, with DHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported employment\nwith the agency as a Youth Advocate since July 2025. Her work\nshift is 3:00PM-11:00PM. She reported receiving training on the\nagency’s behavior policy/how to handle incidents such as physical\nfighting and the safety protocol. She reported if youths are\nfighting the staff are to call 911, and to do a group text denoting\n“Call Doctor Brown”, which would let other staff know there is an\nemergency situation.\nStaff 1 reported the day of the alleged incident, the girls (at this\ntime she did not qualify who those girls were), had got into a fight\nprior to her shift. She reported receiving a call from Youth\nAdvocate Supervisor prior to the start of her shift telling her to get\nto the IL house because the girls had been fighting. Staff 1\nreported that when she arrived at the IL house, Case Manager\nwas there talking with the girls about fighting. Staff 1 reported\nafter that, and even an hour later, all the girls were okay with one\nanother. She reported that day was also check day, and she,\n6",
    "Staff 3 and Case Manager where onsite. Staff 3 and Case\nManager were handing out checks; and later she and Case\nManager took the girls out to cash their check and to grocery\nshop. She advised Youth A did not receive a check and Youth A\nwas upset about that. She added prior to her and Case Manager\ntaking the girls out, an incident occurred between Youth A, Youth\nB, and Youth C. She stated Youth A and Youth B argued over a\npen and then all three of the youths were arguing. Staff 1 reported\nshe believed that tension may have existed between the youths,\nbecause she had learned that earlier in the day Youth B and\nYouth C had attacked Youth A. Staff 1 reported that she and\nCase Manager deescalated the tension/arguing between these\nthree youth and then separated the youths to take them to cash\nchecks. Staff 1 reported having Youth B, Youth C, Youth E and a\nyouth (whom she did not identify) from the Lakewood IL home in\nher vehicle. She reported while out shopping at the beauty store,\nYouth B and Youth C separated from her group. She sought to\nfind them and when back to the Lansdown IL house. She said\nwhile she was in route to the IL house, Case Manager called her\nvia Youth E’s phone (she did not clarify why the contact occurred\nthat way) and reported the girls (she did not identify which girls) at\nthe house were fighting again. Case Manager told her, “I’m too\nold for this”; and upon Staff 1’s arrival at the IL house, Case\nManager “left promptly, and left [Staff 1] alone”. Staff 1 said when\nshe got inside the house, Youth A and Youth C were ready to\nthrow blows. She said as a staff they are not to put hands on the\ngirls, so she tried to calm Youth A down. Staff 1 reported Youth B\nwas not at the house; it was Youth A and Youth C having words\nover what had transpired between the two of them earlier. Staff 1\nsaid she and Youth E were trying to de-escalate Youth A and\nYouth C. She said Youth C asked Youth A whether Youth A\nwanted to fight; and when Youth A said yes, the two started\nfighting. Staff 1 reported because the two youth were fighting she\nwas not to touch them. She said she moved the table and a chair\nout the way, for her safety. She said that was because the girls\nhad already fought, and she was not going to get hit with a table\nor chair.\nShe said there was so much happening that day. She said the\nfirst was with Youth A and Youth C. The second was with Youth A\nand Youth D and that Youth C jumped into. Staff 1 reported the\nlatter fight “was a bad fight”, the girls were on the floor, pulling\neach other. She said she did try to pull them apart at the time.\nThen after that she told Youth A to reflect on the situation and to\nchill, and Youth A pushed her.\n7",
    "Staff 1 reported she called 911, but she was not sure when that\nwas. She thought it was after the second fight in the house; and\nbefore the incident in the bedroom, when Youth A tried to go into a\nbedroom after Youth C and Youth D. Staff 1 admitted she did not\ncall the police as fast as she should have. She stated “that’s\nwhere I messed up. I should have called the police, after the first\nfight.” She stated, “but I was trying to de-escalate” Youth A. She\nsaid Youth A was not listening to anything she said. She said she\ncould not de-escalate Youth A. She did not report what if anything\nshe did to try to calm or de-escalate the other youths. Staff 1 also\nreported that she texted the “Code Brown” in the group chat at\nabout 7:42PM after the second fight between the youths. She\nreported she did not retract that text; she said someone\nresponded back what is Code Brown. She did not report in the\nchat she needed help. She said she had also called Youth\nAdvocate Supervisor five times that day indicating the girls were\ntrying to fight. Staff 1 did not report on the incident with Youth E\nand Youth A outside. Staff 1 denied making a statement to Youth\nA or others that “she wants to get her ass kicked again”.\nOn 8/25/2025, I interviewed Youth D at the agency’s Eastpointe,\nMichigan office with DHHS Worker. Youth D said after they all\nreturned from grocery shopping, Youth A and Youth C argued.\nYouth A asked Youth C whether Youth C wanted to fight. Youth D\nsaid as Youth A and Youth C were arguing she was telling the two\nof them to calm down. She said she was in the middle of them;\nand Youth A asked Youth D whether she was talking to her. Youth\nD reported then Youth A got in her face, so she put down her\nfood, took off her glasses and Youth A hit her and the two of them\nstarted fighting. Youth D said Staff 1 was telling them to stop and\nthen Youth E started recording the fight. Youth D said then she\nand Youth C went into her bedroom, and she held the door\nclosed, while Youth A tried to get inside. Youth D reported Staff 1\nand Youth E were telling Youth A to calm down while Youth A was\ntelling Youth D and Youth C to open the bedroom door and calling\nthem bitches. Youth D said she let go of the door; and Youth A\nentered the bedroom and started fighting Youth C. Youth said\nafter Youth A stopped attacking Youth C, Youth A attacked her\nand they were fighting. Youth D reported while she and Youth C\nwere in the bedroom, she heard Staff 1 calling whom she\nassumed was the police or PD. She assumed that because she\nheard Staff 1 describing what was happening with the fighting.\nYouth D further reported something happened to Staff 1 when\nYouth D and Youth C was in the bedroom. Youth D stated Staff 1\ngot hit with a chair or something, though Youth D did not report\nactually seeing that. Youth D reported after her fight with Youth A,\n8",
    "Youth A threw Youth E’s purse at Youth E. Youth E head locked\nYouth A and took Youth A outside. Youth D stated that’s how the\nfight outside happened, and eight police and one fire truck came.\nYouth D affirmed Case Manager had been on site earlier that day\nbut clarified for us Case Manager is not a youth site worker.\nOn 8/25/2025, I interviewed Youth C at the agency’s Eastpointe,\nMichigan office with DHHS Worker. Youth C reported information\nsimilar to Youth B, Youth E and Youth D related to events that had\ntranspired the day of the incident, and related to all of their\ninteractions, and fighting with Youth A. Youth C reported when\nthey were all fighting in the house Staff 1 was trying to calm\neverything down, by telling them to calm down, to stop, but there\nwas not much Staff 1 could do with teenagers. Youth C reported\nshe would not say Staff 1 encouraged them to fight, but Staff 1 let\nthe fights happen. Youth C said once Staff 1 broke Staff 1’s nail,\nwhich Youth C admit she did not see take place, Staff 1 just let the\nother fighting happen. Youth C said Staff 1 definitively watched\npart of the fighting play out before Staff 1 called the police. Youth\nC reported that when the first fight with her and Youth A occurred\nStaff 1 should have separated them, by telling her to go to one\narea and Youth A to another, but Staff 1 did not do that. Youth C\ndenied witnessing Staff 1 moving furniture during the fighting; and\nshe was not sure if Staff 1 was recording the incidents, but\nreported Staff 1 may have been.\nOn 8/28/2025 DHHS Worker and I spoke with Juvenile Justice\nWorker (JJW), the JJ Worker for Youth A. JJW reported getting\nnotification about the incident about Youth A from the Community\nCare Organization (CCO). She reported being new to Youth A’s\ncase and not being aware of any other incidents for Youth A at\nCCO prior to this incident.\nOn 9/4/2025 I interviewed Youth Advocate Supervisor (YAS) by\ntelephone. YAS affirmed PD’s reporting as to the protocol for\nemergencies related to calling the police, and the Doctor Brown\ncode in a group text if there is an assault. YAS denied Staff 1\ncalling her five times about the youths fighting. She said she had\nchipped in that day and worked the 7:00AM-3:00PM shift prior to\nStaff 1’s shift. She said the youths were all getting along fine\nduring that time. She reported at about 3:08PM she received a\ncall from Staff 4 and another call later from HR (Human\nResources) that there had been a fight at the work site; and the\ngirls could not come back. She said Case Manager went over to\nthe IL house to talk with the girls about them fighting on the\nworksite between 3:30PM-5:00PM. YAS denied any awareness\n9",
    "of Case Manager reporting there was fight or Case Manager\nsaying something to the affect she was too old to deal with such\nshit. She reported Staff 1 and Case Manager should have been\nwith the girls together. She admitted to seeing a text message in\nthe agency’s group chat from Staff 1 about something, but Staff 1\nsaid it was a typo. YAS said Staff 1 never called or texted to say\nthe girls were fighting or that she needed assistance like she\nshould have. YAS reported becoming aware of the girls fighting\noutside from Staff 5 (a worker from another nearby CCO’s IL\nhomes). Staff 5 had seen the typo text from Staff 1 and had gone\nover to the Lansdown IL house at which time Staff 5 and called\nYAS. YAS reported that when she arrived at Lansdown IL house\nthe fighting was over, the police were there, and Youth A was in\nthe ambulance. YAS said she called Case Manager to come back\nonsite to go to the hospital with Youth A. YAS said Case Manager\nseemed surprised to learn about the fight. She also reported that\nYouth A was transferred from the Lansdown IL home to the\nLakewood IL home.\nOn 9/4/2025 I interviewed Case Manager (CM) by telephone. CM\nrecalled going to the Lansdown IL home to talk with the girls about\na fight some of the youths had at their work site. She reported the\ndiscussion was between 1:00PM and 2:00PM. She said she\nstayed onsite until Staff 1 arrived. She said the girls were not\nphysically fighting while she was there, but they were in a verbal\nconfrontation. Youth A and Youth D were calling each other the\n“B” word, and she advised them if they got into a physical fight,\nshe would call the police. She affirmed reports by Staff 1 that they\nseparated the girls to take them to cash checks and shopping.\nShe denied the girls were fighting when she was onsite, or that\nshe called anyone to say the girls were fighting or that she said\nshe was too old for this shit. She said she became aware of a fight\nbetween the youths when PD or YAS called her to come back\nonsite, which was well after 5:00PM.\nVideo footage reviewed:\n• A scene in the living room with Youth A, Youth E, Youth D\nalong with Staff 1. Youth A appeared to be talking and\nwaving her hands, putting them on her hip, taking off her\nshoes, and the other youths appeared to be listening to her,\nthen they walked off and she followed. Staff 1 walked\naround as well.\n• A scene in the dining room where Youth A, Youth E, Youth\nC and Youth D are standing near a dining room table.
