Youth A was specifically assaulted by Youth B\nand staff that were around failed to intervene. Staff failed to\nrestrain a youth harming another youth.\nInvestigation On 3/11/24, I spoke to DHHS Worker 1. Allegations and\nscheduling were discussed. No additional information was\nprovided.\nOn 3/11/24, I left a voicemail for Complainant 1. Complainant 1\ndid not return the voicemail.\nOn 3/11/24 I left a voicemail for Foster Care Worker 1 (FCW 1).\nReturned communication for FCW 1 was not received.\nOn 3/12/24 I spoke to Administrator 1. Administrator 1 reported\nYouth A displays a lack of boundaries with other youth. Youth A\nwill initiate problems amongst his peers and then get upset when\nhis peers get upset at him. Youth A wants to socialize with others\nbut doesn’t have boundaries and doesn’t handle transitions well.\nAdministrator 1 reported they do have a safety plan in place for\nYouth A that staff are aware of. He also has an upcoming\npsychiatric evaluation scheduled for medication adjustments.\nSpecific allegations are for an incident on 3/7/24 at 11:41am. The\nincident occurred in the dining room while the unit was eating\nlunch.\nThe following interviews were conducted with DHHS Worker 1\nat the facility on 3/18/24:\n2",
    "Clinical Director 1:\nClinical Director 1 reported he is aware of the incident in question.\nHe reported he watched the video and did not find any issues with\nhow his staff handled the situation. He reported staff were actively\nengaged with the youth and they intervened. He reported Youth A\nhas been involved in multiple situations, usually back and forth\nverbally with other youth. But would not state that Youth A is the\nonly one in the incidents. At times Youth A starts the verbal\naggression and at times other youth start it. Clinical Director 1\nreported Youth A is not always involved in the issues in the unit.\nClinical Director 1 reported they have a treatment plan in place\nthat staff are aware of. Youth A has difficulties during transitions,\nso they have staff near him during transitions.

Youth\nA reported Staff 1 usually stays with him. Youth A reported he\nlikes Staff 1. Youth A reports other kids bully him, but when\nquestioned did not want to talk about it.\nYouth B was unable to be interviewed at the time of the\ninterviews. Youth B was AWOL.\nStaff 1\nStaff 1 reported he was working on 3/7/24 during the incident.\nBoth Youth A and Youth B were throwing food back and forth at\neach other. Staff 2 and himself intervened and redirected Youth A\nto stop and move his seat. Youth A did not listen to the directive.\nThey continued to throw food back and forth although verbally\nredirected. Youth A began to use profanity and Youth B then\nstood up and attempted to go around the lunch table to fight Youth\nA. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 went over to Youth B and talked to him\nwhile he stayed with Youth A. Staff 1 reported the two youth were\nnever able to physical touch each other and not seen by the nurse\nbecause there was never a fight. Staff 1 reported they have\ndiscussed Youth A’s behaviors and treatment plan in team\nmeetings and came up with a 1:1 staffing plan. Staff 1 reported he\nis the 1:1 staff on his shift because he has a good relationship with\nYouth A. Staff 1 reported Youth A does create situations for\nhimself. Staff 1 reported he will say sexual comments to the other\nyouth and upset them. Staff 1 reported that in school Youth A is\n3",
    "unable to sit still for long periods of time, so they give him breaks\nevery 10-15 minutes. Youth A will take walks with him when he\nneeds space as well. Staff 1 reported he has never witnessed\nanyone able to physically assault Youth A. Staff 1 reported the\nstaff verbally redirect and get in between the youth if they attempt\nto fight.\nStaff 2\nStaff 2 reported he was working on 3/7/24 during the incident.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A and Youth B were pushing a milk carton\nback and forth on the table. Staff 2 reported he stood behind\nYouth A and redirected them to stop. Youth A stood up and then\nYouth B did. Staff 2 reported he intervened and stood between the\nyouth. Staff 1 was present, along with Youth A. Staff 2 reported\nthe youth never physically fought. Staff 2 reported Youth A is\ncognitively low functioning and has a hard time socializing with the\nother peers. Staff 2 reported he does not get targeted by other\nyouth but does place himself in situations where he and the other\nyouth want to fight. Staff 2 reported the treatment team is\nattempting to help Youth A vocalize appropriately with other youth\nby not cussing at them or yelling at them. Staff 2 reported they\nhave discussed Youth A in team meetings and have made some\nchanges with his line transitions. Staff 2 reported when Youth A is\nin line there are two staff near him to help him transition well. In\nschool, he has a 1:1 staff that helps him throughout the day. Staff\n2 reported he has never seen other youth allowed to fight Youth A\nand has always seen staff intervene and redirect the other youth\nas well as Youth A when needed.\nStaff 3\nStaff 3 reported she was working on 3/7/24 during the incident.\nStaff 3 reported Youth A and Youth B were tossing food back and\nforth towards each other at the lunchroom.

He misses\nsocial cues as well. Staff 3 reported they have discussed Youth A\nin team meetings and have set up different interventions for him.\nStaff are to be near him to help him process situations and to\nprotect himself and others from physical altercations. He also is\ninvolved in the Pathways program for sex offenders with his\ntherapist.\n4",
    "Staff 4 was contacted via telephone on 3/18/24 and 4/11/24 and\nreturn communication was not received.\nVideo Review:\nI watched the video concerning the specific incident. The incident\nin question occurred on 3/7/24 in the dining room. It started at\n11:41:48am and ended at 11:44:42am. Youth A and Youth B were\nsitting across from each other at the lunch table and began\ntossing food items back and forth towards each other. Staff 1,\nStaff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 were all present. Staff used proximity,\nverbal redirection, and separation to deescalate the situation. All\nstaff intervened. Youth were not physical towards one another.\nDocumentation Review:\nYouth A Safety Plan: The safety plan was created on 2/15/24.\nYouth A has additional staff near him, availability of breaks from\nthe group and interventions to help with positive interactions with\npeers. Once escalated, verbal redirection will occur, and he will be\nremoved from situations.\nYouth A’s Intake: Youth A has been placed in the facility since\n2/6/24.\nUnusual Incident Report Summary: I reviewed the facilities\nelectronic case noting and incident reporting system, Carelogic.\nYouth A has had 8 incidents from 2/6/24-3/7/24. Only one incident\nreport dated, 2/24/24 noted Youth A was antagonized by another\npeer. All other reports noted Youth A as escalating the situation,\nassaultive to other peers or not listening to staff directions.\n• 2/24/24 incident: Youth A was being antagonized by\nanother peer, so Youth A slapped the other youth, the other\nyouth responded by punching Youth A. Staff separated\nthem.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to validate Youth A was assaulted often or\nassaulted in this incident on 3/7/24. Interviews, video, and incident\nreports support the agency is aware of Youth A’s needs and have\nplaced appropriate interventions in place. All staff were able to\nverbalize those interventions and video demonstrated their\ncompliance to them. Youth A verbalized he was not assaulted on\n3/7/24 and that a staff remains with him all the time. In this specific\nincident, the staff did not need to intervene with a restraint, they\nverbally deescalated, used proximity, and separated the youth\n5",
    "from each other. Allegations noting the staff allowed Youth B to\nassault Youth A without intervening is unfounded.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Behavior Management\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4157\nSection (2) At a minimum the behavior management system shall\nDescription include all of the following: (b) positive interventions\nstrategies to assist residents in developing improved\nproblem solving, self-management, and social skills.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency is not doing anything to prevent incidents from\noccurring with Youth A.\nInvestigation\nAdministrator 1\nOn 3/12/24 I spoke to Administrator 1.

    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted into allegations that staff at Queen of Angels failed to intervene and restrain Youth B from assaulting Youth A, and that the agency was not doing enough to prevent incidents involving Youth A. The investigation, which included interviews, video review, and document analysis, found that staff appropriately used verbal de-escalation, proximity, and separation to manage a lunchroom incident on March 7, 2024, preventing physical contact. It also found that a safety plan and multiple interventions (1:1 staffing, transition support, treatment plans) were in place for Youth A. Culpability lies with the complainant, as the allegations were unfounded and the facility was found to be in compliance.",
