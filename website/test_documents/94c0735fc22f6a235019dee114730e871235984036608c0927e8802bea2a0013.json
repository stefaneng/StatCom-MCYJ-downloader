    "03/10/2022 Pre-Exit conference\nWith the Program Manager.\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that Youth A was able to access medication and ingest the bottle\nof prescription medication. Staff do not have an explanation for how Youth A\nwas able to access the medication.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI received video footage of Youth A’s medication. The medication was in a pink\nstorage container lock box. There was no other youth’s medication in the box.\nI interviewed Youth A, age 17, in her current placement location. Youth A alleged\nshe swallowed a half bottle of Lithium pills that was prescribed to her. She said no\none witnessed her taking the pills. She said her pills were on the kitchen table and\nthey had just been refilled. She said she took the pills because she was upset and\nwanted to take her life. Youth A did not disclose why she was upset or why she\nwanted to take her life in the beginning of this conversation. She said one of her\npeers told Staff 1 that she had ingested the pills and Staff 1 made her throw up. She\ndid not identify the peer who told staff that she had taken the pills. She said she was\nangry with the staff and the program because she felt she was lied to about the\nprogram. She said she could not excel in the program and that she wanted to leave\nand this was her way out. Youth A said she only took her pills that was sitting out on\nthe kitchen table. She vacillated between the number of pills she swallowed. She\nsaid she took a half of bottle and there were 60 pills in the bottle. She then stated\nshe was unsure of how many pills she took on that day.\nYouth A said she was transported to emergency at St. John’s hospital, and that her\nagency caseworker went to the hospital with her. Youth A said she was at the\nhospital for about a minute. She said the hospital staff monitored her Lithium levels\nand she was released and went back to the Independent Living program.\nI reviewed documentation from St. John’s Hospital dated 01/21/2022. The\ninstructions were to follow up within 3-7 days and continue to take medication as\nprescribed. There were no procedures performed or documented for Youth A.\nI interviewed Youth B, age 17, regarding the allegation. She said she did not\nobserve Youth A take any pills. She said she was in the area with Youth A the entire\ntime and that the girls had been smoking “Weed” including herself. She said the next\nthing she knew; Youth A was told by Staff 1 to throw up and the supervisor call for\nemergency and Youth A was transported to the hospital. Youth B said she was the\nonly other youth in the program who is prescribed medication. She said her\n3",
    "medication as well as Youth A’s medication is in a lock box and kept in their\nbedrooms. She said they do not have access to each other’s medication.\nI interviewed the agency caseworker. She reported Youth A told her she had\nswallowed half of her medication and she told Youth A to throw up. She said she did\nnot know how many pills Youth A had swallowed because she did not know how\nmany pills Youth A had in her possession. She said she contacted the agency\nsupervisor and was informed to take Youth A to emergency. She said Youth A was\nvery rational while being transported to the hospital. Staff 1 said the doctor\nexamined Youth A and reported her vital signs were normal and her Lithium levels\nwere low and in average range. She said there were no other procedures\ncompleted on Youth A and Youth A was discharged from the hospital.\nI interviewed Youth A’s DHHS Worker. She reported that Youth A case is very\nchallenging and takes a lot of work. She described Youth A as being very intelligent\nand knows the child welfare system very well. She said Youth A is influenced by her\nmother. She said Youth A has AWOLed several times since being place in the IL\nprogram and she does not follow directions. The worker said Youth A is very\nmanipulative and knows how to get her way. She said Youth A has been involved in\nmany fights and most of the fights, she instigates. She said Youth A is in the IL\nProgram because she is a hard to place youth given the fact that she is a dual ward\nwith assaultive behaviors.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Probation Officer. She reported that Youth A does not have\nany appropriate coping skills to assist her in de-escalating when she is out of control.\nShe said she was unaware that Youth A was prescribed Lithium pills. She said no\nother placement was willing to take Youth A right now because she continues to\nAWOL from her IL placement. She said Youth A was placed on 11/17/21 and have\nhad three AWOL’s. She said she wanted to file a petition on Youth A for violation of\nprobation for removal but was not able to do so. The Probation Officed said Youth A\nwas not ready for an IL placement because it afforded her to much independence\nand Youth A cannot handle that. She said when Youth A was in her prior\nplacement, she completed her levels because she knows how to manipulate the\nsystem and this was how she was able to go to an IL program. She stressed that\nYouth A is a very intelligent young lady. She said Youth A had two drug screens\nand they both tested positive for marijuana. The Probation Officer said she visited\nwith Youth A the day she said she swallowed her medication. She said when the\nmedication was dropped off she witness Youth A take the medication off the table\nand place the medication in her lock box.\nI reviewed the agency policy on medication. The policy states, youth are\nresponsible for prescribed prescriptions and non-prescription (over the counter)\nmedication. All medication prescribed and non-prescribed are stored in an assigned\ncontainer that will be given to the youth. The caseworker will assist the youth in\nprefilling a prescribe medication, if applicable.\n4",
    "Youth will not exchange, administer or take another youth’s medication; this includes\nprescribed and non-prescribed medication. Youth will not accept medication\n(prescribed or non-prescribed) from Community Care Organization.\nStaff may prompt the youth to take their medication but ultimately it is the youth\nresponsibility to take medication at the scheduled time. If the youth refuse to take\nthe prescribed medication, three times, a family team meeting (FTM) will be\nscheduled. The youth may or may not be ask to attend the FTM.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is suggested that the agency put in place a system that is more accountable\nin regard to medication being administered. It is suggested that an\nassessment of the youth’s maturity level, cognitive functioning, and past\nsubstance use be taken in consideration. It is suggested that a discussion\ntake place with the IL home and placing professionals to determine if the IL\nhome is the best placement to meet the needs of the IL youth regarding\nprescribed medications prior to acceptance into the IL program.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12507 Medical/dental and mental health care.\n(1) An agency shall ensure that a youth in independent\nliving receives any needed medical, dental, and mental\nhealth care as required in R 400.12413. Medical, dental, and\nmental health care provided shall be documented in the\nyouth's record.\nANALYSIS:\nYouth A said she took a half of bottle of Lithium pills. She said\nno one observed her take the pills but later said one of her\npeers shared the information with the staff. The hospital\ndischarge papers performed no procedure on Youth A noting\nher vital signs were good and her Lithium levels were low. She\nwas sent back to her IL placement. It is undetermined if Youth\nA swallowed pills or not. There were no evidence to suggest\notherwise. The agency is not in violation with this rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n5",
