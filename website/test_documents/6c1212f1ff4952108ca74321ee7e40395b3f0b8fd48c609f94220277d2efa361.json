EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one corrective action plan (CAP) during this period\nunder review. The CAP related to the agency Renewal Inspection completed on\n6/9/2023 with a CAP approved on 6/28/2023. During inspection the agency\nreceived 4 rule violations, 1 of which was a repeat violation this year. The\nagency’s compliance around this repeat violation remained the same this year as\nlast year, in that the individual cases cited for the violation was 1 of 3.\nIn the agency’s 2022 Interim inspection, 12 violations were established, 1 of which\nwas a repeat violation this year. That violation is for the same repeat violation\ncited last year; and the agency’s compliance around it as it relates to individual\ncases cited was also the same 1 of 3.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a Chief Administrator’s (CA) report dated 5/16/2024.\nThe assessment report indicated the agency believes it is in substantial\ncompliance with the rules and policies. In terms of key performance indicators\n(KPI) the CA reported the agency had a couple of late dentals due to independent\nliving youth’s refusal and also foster parent /relative caregiver’s procrastination.\nAdditionally, the agency reported not being able to meet all parent-child contacts,\ndue to the parents consistently not showing up for the visit.\n4",
    "The CA indicated a system’s issue they have been dealing with is the long wait for\nnon-emergency dental appointments in Jackson for dentist who take Medicaid.\nThe agency continues to work around this issue.\nThe agency reported staffing has been stable and they have been able to increase\ntheir client counts. They have also purchased an agency car which they anticipate\nwill assist them around matters of visitations and various other transportation\nneeds. As for last year’s CAP, the CA reported the CAP was beneficial in\nhighlighting areas of concern; and had a positive effect on helping supervisors and\nmanagers track compliance and implement necessary new procedures.\nOverall, notwithstanding the one repeat violation, they agency is in compliance\nwith their CAP.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a 2024 annual financial budget, and end of the year\n9/30/2023 independent financial audit. A review of these documents did not\nreveal a major area of concern.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to my discussion with the chief administrator, program manager and\nfoster care supervisor during the entrance conference, I interviewed a visitation\nworker, foster care worker, adoption worker, and the adoption worker/licensing\nsupervisor. The staff reported positive remarks about the agency, the\nadministrators, and management of the agency. All reported feeling appreciated\nand supported. They viewed the agency as a good place to work, and where there\nis good communication, and solutions are offered and/or sought. Areas of growth\nor improvements indicated was for more meaningful family team meetings; and\nimproving communication across programs related to shared/ and or transferring\ncases, so as to ensure all are on the same page.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility was conducted and no area of concerns were\nobserved. The agency had adequate accommodations for it staff, and case\nrecords were properly stored and secured.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one safety alert received this period, on 3/4/2024.\nSafety Alert:\nThere is a mobile toy attached to one of the cribs that needs to be.\nremoved.\n5",

RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJune 17, 2024\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 26, 2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n6"
