TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTechnical assistance was provided regarding proper documentation of initial health\nscreenings of youth being admitted to the facility from the other residential programs\nwithin the overall organization.

EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: Two\ncorrective action plans were approved during this reporting period, both the results\nof special investigations. SIR #2025SIC0000390 produced a CAP related to rule\nviolations for staff using inappropriate language towards youth. The CAP included\naction steps for the staff being involved having their employment terminated and\nre-training of remaining staff on facility policy regarding the treatment of youth.\nStaff were all trained as required on the CAP and no follow up concerns have\nbeen found. SIR #2025SIC0000420 produced a CAP related to the same rule\nviolation. The CAP contained similar action items.\nFinancial Overview\nThe organization’s most recent financial audit for 2023 and a current budget was\nreviewed, and no concerns were noted about the organization.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe annual Chief Administrator assessment was completed on 06/30/2025. The\nChief Administrator discussed an influx of newly hired staff, contractual changes\nthat resulted in programming changes, successful discharges with only one being\nunplanned and the facility restraint reduction efforts.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff were interviewed during an unannounced, face-to-face visit on 07/03/2025.\nStaff reported positive experiences working at the program.

    "program. They also felt that the milieu of the program allowed them to get to know\nthe youth well.\nYouth were interviewed during an unannounced, face-to-face visit on 07/03/2025.\nYouth reported positive experiences at the program overall. They felt that the\ncommunication within the program was adequate, and their personal needs were\nmet well. Struggles were noted with the smaller size of the census of the program\nand the frequency with which decisions about safety from staff regarding youth\nwould cause activities or outings to be difficult to implement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe facility house was toured during an unannounced, face-to-face visit on\n07/03/2025. No safety concerns were noted. It was in clean and organized\ncondition and there were ample supplies and groceries.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n07/14/2025\n___________________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 15, 2025\n___________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
