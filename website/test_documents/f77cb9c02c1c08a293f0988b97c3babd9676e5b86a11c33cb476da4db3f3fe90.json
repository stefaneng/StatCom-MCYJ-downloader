He stated that\nhe has been at the facility for 4 1/2 months and has been in Unit 2 the\nentire time. Youth A stated that the alleged incident started at about\n7:15 PM on 12/03/2022. Youth A recalled the beginning of the alleged\nincident in that another youth, Youth C, was trying to fight him. He\nstated he came out of his unit and attempted to get to the other unit\nwhere Youth C resides. Youth A recalled that Staff 1 was in the other\nunit as he approached, and Staff 1 noticed Youth A and came outside\nof that unit and shut the door. Youth A remembered that Staff 1 was\ntrying to get some paper to put over the window of the unit. Youth A\nstated that at that point he was trying to get into the unit and break the\ndoor handle. He remembered Staff 1 stating “What are you doing?” and\nYouth A stated that he was ignoring him. Youth A then recalled that\nStaff 1 grabbed him by the throat and started choking him. He said that\nStaff 1 had both hands around his neck. Youth A then stated that his\nhead was slammed against the brick wall five or six times by Staff 1. As\na scuffle ensued, Youth A stated that the entire incident lasted about a\nhalf a minute and Staff 1 briefly let him go. Youth A stated that he then\npushed Staff 1 out of the way and ran through the common area and\nout of the building. Youth A believed that there was no one out in the\nhallway or common area as he ran out. Youth A stated that Staff 1 then\nfollowed him outside as Youth A broke a few exterior windows. Youth A\nremembered that other staff, including Supervisor 1, came out and at\nthat point, Staff 1 was removed from the situation and sent home.\nYouth A said he had never had a physical incident like this with Staff 1\nbefore, only that they had gotten into verbal arguments, but nothing that\nescalated further. He also stated that he has not seen any other youth\nget into physical altercations with Staff 1.\nStaff 1 was interviewed during an unannounced face to face visit to the\nfacility on 12/05/2022 with DHHS Worker 1 and Law Enforcement.\nStaff 1 confirmed that he was a part of the alleged incident that\noccurred the prior Saturday, 12/03/2022.

Staff 1\nbelieved that he was alone in the common area at the time, and that he\nwas near the Program Manager's office.

    "grabbed some paper from the Program Manager‘s office to cover the\nwindows of the unit Youth A wanted to get in to, hoping that would help\nde-escalate him. He said he attempted to hang paper up but wasn’t\nable to because he didn’t have enough tape. Staff 1 stated that, at that\npoint, he stood in front of the door to be in Youth A’s way, so he cannot\nsee into the unit. He believed that Youth A was trying to get to another\nyouth within the unit that he had issues with. Staff 1 remembered Youth\nA getting very upset and attempted to push him. Staff 1 remembered\nYouth A taking a swing at him in an attempt to punch him at that point.\nStaff 1 stated he put out his arms to push Youth A away from him and\nYouth A attempted to punch him several more times. Staff 1 believed\nthat he then pushed Youth A toward the wall next to the door of the unit\nthey were near.
