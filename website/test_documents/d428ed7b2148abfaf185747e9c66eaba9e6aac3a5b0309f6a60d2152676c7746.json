At the\nbeginning of the interview, Youth A failed to distinguish several\nintroductory questions from DHHS Worker 1, including making the\nstatement that he has been hiding chainsaws under his bed as an\nexample of a truth when distinguishing between truths and a lie.\nYouth A stated that he could not remember which staff had hurt\nhim, but that during the incident in question the staff member had\ndug her nails into his forearm. He stated that he had grabbed the\nstaff members glasses and was breaking them at that time. Youth\nA stated this occurred near the fence behind his unit. Youth A\nstated the staff member pushed her forearm into his neck,\npressing him up against the fence and punched him in the lip\nduring this altercation. Youth A remembered the staff member\nattempted to kick him in his legs, but they missed. Youth A stated\nthis entire incident ended with the staff member “pretending” to try\nto help him as they went back inside the side entrance of the\nunit. Youth A reported the staff member pushed him to the ground\nfirst before any of the other actions he described. Youth A\nadmitted to punching the staff member in the stomach during the\naltercation. Youth A believed no one was watching and no other\nstaff or youth were around to have witnessed this interaction.\nYouth A recalled the staff member stating she “could handle this\nby herself” as the two of them first went outside. Youth A also\nstated he felt like the female staff member pushed him in the chest\nas they walked back inside. He reported the staff member has\nnever hurt him before. He described her with short hair, dyed\ngreen hair, blue eyes that “turn green, and then red when she gets\n2",
    "angry.” Youth A stated several times he felt like the staff member\nwas very mean. When asked to describe his injuries from the\nincident, Youth A stated he had a cut on his lip, but that it had\nhealed by the point in time of the interview. He also stated he had\ncuts on his left forearm. Youth A stated he gets frequent skin\nrashes that he sometimes itches until they bleed and is given a\ncream every day for his forearms. Youth A stated he got three\nblack eyes from the incident, but no black eyes were visible during\nthe interview.\nLater that same day, Youth A was re-interviewed with DHHS\nWorker 1 and showed the location where the incident occurred.\nYouth A reported he and Staff 1 had both come out of the back\ndoor of the unit and this is where Staff 1 had pushed him against\nthe fence with her arm. Youth A then stated that he moved about\n10 or 15 feet to his right side of the building and that is where he\nbroke her glasses. Youth A stated multiple times that she was\nbeing “fake” with him when she attempted to let him inside. Youth\nA stated that he was sitting on some cinder blocks that are located\nin between his unit and the one next to it when Staff 5 came out to\nsee him. Youth A stated several times “this stuff happened for\nreal” and “she was way super mean to me.” Youth A stated Staff 5\nwas the first staff member other than Staff 1 he encountered after\nthe incident and Staff 5 took him to play basketball afterwards.\nYouth A was interviewed on 05/17/2023 at a local child advocacy\ncenter and this was able to be viewed over video. Youth A stated\nhe was able to distinguish between a truth and a lie and\nunderstand if the interviewer was saying something incorrect by\nresponding with a story about how he had taught a professional\nbasketball player how to shoot the basketball just the other day.\nHe also stated “I’m not sure what is the truth” at one point during\nthe beginning of the interview. When asked to describe the\nincident in question, Youth A stated Staff 1 had pushed him into\nthe fence, and she had locked him outside. Youth A confirmed he\nhad broken Staff 1 glasses during the incident. He stated Staff 1\nhad dug her nails into his arm. Youth A believed this all happened\nabout one or two months ago. He also stated Staff 1 scratched\nhim on the face. Youth A stated he initially was upset with Staff 1\nbecause she followed him outside and he stated, “stop following\nme.” He believed Staff 1 had pretended to call the police during\nthe incident. Youth A stated he was bleeding on his arm, and\nStaff 5 had seen him bleeding after the incident. He stated Staff 1\nalso tried to kick him during the peak of the incident. Youth A\ndenied he had been bit.\n3",
    "Staff 1 was interviewed on 04/19/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. Staff 1\nstated she has worked at the facility since October 2022 as a\ndirect care staff. Staff 1 stated she does not usually work in Youth\nA’s unit but on the day in question she was asked to come over\nand assist because several youths were struggling, and more staff\nwere needed. Staff 1 confirmed she was the staff member in\nquestion that Youth A was referring to. Staff 1 stated around\ndinner time, the facility’s Crisis Response Team was called\nbecause Youth A had been struggling all day, including a fight with\nYouth B. She recalled during this incident; Youth A was punched\nin the eye by Youth B. Staff 1 stated the other staff that were\ninvolved after the incident were Staff 2, Staff 4, and Staff 7. Staff\n1 stated the beginning of this incident occurred when Youth A\nstormed out of the unit and began to grab on doors and knock on\nwindows. Staff 1 believed he was trying to set off an alarm. Staff 1\nstated she followed Youth A outside to maintain line of sight and\ntry to talk to him. She noted she had stayed arms reach away from\nhim. Staff 1 stated Youth A did not say much and turned around to\nstart attempting to hit her. She stated she blocked these attempts\nwith her forearms, and in the process reached in her pocket to\ngrab her cell phone, causing her glasses to fall off. Staff 1 stated\nshe remembered Staff 4 coming outside behind them at this point.\nStaff 1 stated Youth A took her glasses from her hand and broke\nthem. Staff 1 stated she attempted to block the punches from\nYouth A for about 45 seconds from start to finish. The whole\nincident occurred near the back door of the unit. Staff 1 stated she\ndid not recall seeing Youth A fall by the door. Staff 1 stated she\ncalled the Crisis Response Team number twice and both times it\nwent to voicemail, so she called Staff 2 for assistance, and he\nanswered his phone. Staff 1 denied shoving or pushing Youth A\nduring the incident. She stated she only used her forearm and was\nblocking his punches. Staff 1 stated she never grabbed Youth A at\nany point during the interaction. As they were walking back into\nthe unit, Youth A attempted to hit her again and she blocked his\narm once more. Staff 1 reiterated she never shoved Youth A and\nshe did not believe he made contact with the back fence at any\npoint during the interaction. She recalled when he made contact\nwith her and hit her in the face during one of his attempts, he was\nclose to the fence, though. Staff 1 believed there was not anyone\noutside that could have seen this and the windows that look out to\nthat area are covered in a film that would not make it easy to see\nwhat was occurring. Staff 1 did not know what might have caused\nthe cut on Youth A‘s lip. She denied punching Youth A in the face.\nShe stated she did not know an arm injury had occurred to Youth\nA. Staff 1 stated she later heard Nurse 1 refer to a “prick” on\n4",
    "Youth A‘s arm. Staff 1 stated she did not believe she caused any\nscratches or cuts to Youth A‘s arm during the incident because\nshe doesn’t have long fingernails. She stated she has been\ntrained to keep her hands off and open during an incident like this\nin order to avoid having her hands closed in a fist and accidentally\nhitting someone.\nStaff 1 was interviewed again over the phone with DHHS Worker\n1 on 05/02/2023. She stated she had been informed of all of the\nallegations made by Youth A after the fact, but also stated she\nhad heard him say something to the same effect when they came\nback inside the building. Staff 1 stated once the incident had\nended, and they came back inside the unit she attempted to stay\naway from Youth A because of his escalated state. She stated she\nhad not seen any injuries on his arm or any injuries to his lip prior\nto the incident in question. Staff 1 was asked more about any\npossible physicality during the incident itself. She stated she had\nonly been trying to block any punches thrown by Youth A by\nkeeping her hands open and using her forearms. She stated\nYouth A had hit her in the face, body, and stomach with punches\nduring the peak of the incident. This is when her glasses were\nknocked off, and as she went to pick them up, he grabbed them\nfrom her hand and kept them. She did not believe Youth A ever hit\nher with his forearms themselves, but more like punches with his\nhands. She believed when he was trying to kick her, it was\npossible he had tripped or stumbled, but she was not 100% sure if\nhe ever fell to the ground. Staff 1 stated she had walked back into\nthe building alone with Staff 2 outside with Youth A. She stated\nshe could not see very well when she came in because she was\nnot wearing her glasses at the time. Staff 1 stated she did not\nbelieve she did anything that could have caused Youth A‘s injuries\nto his forearm or his lip during the accident.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed on 04/19/2023 with DHHS Worker\n1 during an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She\nstated she is a manager that generally works in a different unit\nthan Youth A. Supervisor 1 reported she was with Youth A when\nhe went to bed the night of the incident and he did not state\nanything about being hit or harmed by Staff 1.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 04/19/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He stated\nhe generally works in the same unit as Youth A. It has been Staff\n2's experience that Youth A runs outside the side and back doors\nof the unit when he gets escalated and upset, but this generally\ndoes not turn into a more escalated situation. He has seen Youth\n5",
    "A punch walls and hit his own head on the wall. Staff 2 stated the\nincident in question occurred during shift change and extended\ninto the night. Staff 2 stated Youth B and another youth that he\ncould not remember walked out of the unit behind Youth A but\nquickly came inside. He remembered Staff 4 and Staff 5 coming in\nto assist. Staff 2 stated he couldn’t see anything once Staff 1 and\nYouth A went outside. He said they were outside for a few\nminutes. Staff 2 saw Youth A and Staff 1 walking back toward the\nside door and noticed Youth A had Staff 1 glasses, and Youth A\nproceeded to snap them in half within Staff 2‘s view. Staff 2\ncouldn’t remember exactly what Youth A was saying other than\nnotable cursing towards Staff 1. Staff 2 stated Youth A and Staff 1\ncame right back inside next to each other. He recalled Staff 1 did\nnot have her hands on Youth A. After they came back inside,\nStaff 2 stated Youth A was still escalated while in the unit,\nincluding cussing and yelling. He recalled hearing Youth A say\nthat “she bit me.” Staff 2 believed Staff 5 took Youth A to the\nnurses station. Staff 2 did not believe Youth A was bleeding when\nhe came inside. Staff 2 stated he was concerned about how\ntruthful Youth A was in that moment because there had been\nconcerns about similar statements being made in the past,\nincluding that day when Youth A had stated he broke his arm\nwhen playing basketball. Staff 2 stated he did not have any\nconcerns about Staff 1, as he has never seen her be physical, and\nthe older youth on the unit she generally worked had great\naffection for her. Staff 2 reiterated he never saw Staff 1 touch or\nassault Youth A. Staff 2 recalled prior to this specific part of the\nincident Youth A had a pencil and had attempted to stab himself in\nthe arm as well as stab other staff. Staff 2 stated incidents like this\nhappen very frequently with Youth A. He reiterated that this is the\nkind of incident where Youth A would attempt to self-harm, and in\nthe same action state staff were doing it to him.\nNurse 1 was interviewed on 04/19/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced face-to-face visit at the facility. She stated\nshe saw Youth A twice on the day in question. Once was because\nhe had been involved in a restraint the day prior, and that visit\nproduced no concerns. Later that evening, she saw Youth A and\nprovided a quick examination because he had a bruise on his\nforearm that appeared to have a poke in it. She recalled it was\nbleeding at the time. She cleaned the wound and asked him to\ntake a shower. Nurse 1 stated she asked Youth A to shower\nbecause he has significant struggles with hygiene, and this greatly\nexacerbates the rash and skin issues on his arms which he\ncommonly picks at. After the shower, she was planning on seeing\nYouth A again to treat the wound and his irritated skin. Nurse 1\n6",
    "stated Staff 5 was with him, and she took photos of his arms, and\nin doing so Youth A alleged he was bit by Staff 1. Nurse 1 stated\nat first, she asked what had occurred and he stated that he “did\nthat outside” when referencing the injuries on his arm, but then a\nminute later he stated that staff did that to his arm. Nurse 1 stated\nthere were no marks on Youth A‘s arm or lip that looked like a\nbite, they looked more like bruising from a blunt force and a poke\nthat had severed the skin and caused it to bleed slightly. She\nstated it looked fresh. Nurse 1 stated she works to ensure Youth A\ngets ointment on breakouts that occur all over his body, most\ncommonly on his forearms. She stated it is used as needed, but\nthis comes up frequently. Nurse 1 recalled Youth A stated he had\na cut on his lip, and it was red but not bleeding at the time. Youth\nA stated he had a run-in with staff. She stated she was not sure\nwhat had actually occurred or not, and believed it was difficult to\ntell just from comments made from Youth A. She stated she has\nheard him allege different times in the past that staff have hurt him\nwhen that did not appear to be true. Nurse 1 also stated there\nhave been times that Youth A has escalated to the point of\npunching her while attempting to provide him treatment. The only\nthing she could remember that Youth A said more specifically was\n“she kept making it so that I can’t do stuff.”\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed on 04/19/2023 with DHHS Worker\n1 during an unannounced face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nstated she often works in Youth A‘s unit and was working on the\nday in question. Supervisor 2 stated she was off grounds with\nanother youth and returned about 8:30 PM. At this time the\nphysical part of the incident in question had already occurred.\nSupervisor 2 stated she and Staff 6 woke Youth A up in order to\ntake him to the hospital to ensure that any possible injuries were\nproperly treated and examined. Supervisor 2 stated Supervisor 3\nhad made this decision. Youth A was asked about what happened\nand said that the back of his foot hurt and “that’s where she kicked\nme.” Supervisor 2 stated she took pictures of his foot, arms, lip\nand face, around 10 PM. Supervisor 2 recalled Youth A stated that\nhis injury on his arm came from playing basketball earlier in the\nday. Supervisor 2 also recalled Youth A stated that “she bit me\nhere” but could not specify which arm he was referring to when he\nsaid this to her. Supervisor 2 stated she heard from other staff\nYouth A stated something to the effect of being punched in his\nface and that’s what caused his lip to bleed. She stated she heard\nfrom Nurse 1 that he may have rubbed himself with a pencil or\nstabbed himself with a pencil and that’s what might have caused\nhis forearm injuries. Supervisor 2 stated she had no prior\n7",
    "concerns with Staff 1 and noted she observed Staff 1 as cool,\ncalm, and collected after this incident occurred.\nStaff 3 was interviewed on 04/19/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. He stated\nhe was the assigned case manager for Youth A for about the last\ntwo years. Staff 3 stated Youth A is playful, and then he often tries\nto come off “bigger than he is.” Staff 3 stated Youth A often gets\ninto fights and altercations with other youth, and sometimes staff.\nStaff 3 stated he believes Youth A has decent relationships with\nmany of the staff despite often lashing out at them. Staff 3 stated\nYouth A has tried to hit him a few times during their time working\ntogether, and he also tries to climb things when he is upset.

Youth B\nstated she had an incident earlier in the day on the day in question\nwith Youth A. She remembered him throwing a water bottle at her\nand she attempted to throw a chair at him. Youth B stated this\noccurred because Youth A thought she had “lied on him” to staff.\nYouth B stated she had seen part of the alleged physical incident\nwith Youth A and Staff 1 outside the back of the unit because she\nhad the back door open. Youth B stated this is the only way to\nhave a clear view of this area unless you are looking through\nsome of the windows in the front of the unit, which cannot see all\nthe way to the back door. She stated she saw Staff 1 trying to\npush Youth A off of her. Youth B stated the part of the incident she\nsaw involved Staff 1 not attempting to hit or harm Youth A, but\nYouth A was the aggressor towards Staff 1. Youth B stated she\nwas not able to see anything further because a “code red” was\ncalled, and that requires her to voluntarily go by her room, so she\ndoes not accidentally become involved in the incident. She stated\nthe last thing she saw was Youth A going inside and throwing\ntrash cans around. Youth B stated she and Youth A have gotten\ninto several fights recently, including earlier on the day in question\nwhen they both had punched each other in the head.\nYouth C was interviewed on 04/19/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced face-to-face visit at the facility. She stated\nshe has seen Youth A escalate almost every day recently, and\nthis involved witnessing him attempting to hit Staff 1 and walk out\nof the units.

    "the face. Youth C stated she has seen Youth A attempt to make\nhis nose bleed in the past in order for it to seem like he was hit by\nsomeone else. During the incident in question, she was in her\nroom, and came out and saw Youth A escalated in the unit and\nattempted to hit a female staff member which she couldn’t\nremember which staff member. Youth C stated she saw Youth A\ngo outside and Staff 1 follow him. Youth C stated she did not see\nwhat occurred outside after this point in time. Youth C expressed\nStaff 1 is a good staff and she has never seen her be physical or\nmean with any youth.\nStaff 4 was interviewed on 04/25/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit at the facility. He stated he\nwas working in Youth A’s unit on the day of the alleged incident.\nHe stated he entered the unit from the hallway, and noticed\nimmediate commotion involving Youth A while he was still inside.\nAll Staff 4 could recall hearing was various youth stating they saw\nYouth A break Staff 1’s glasses. Staff 4 said he went to the side\ndoor and saw through the window Youth A holding the door and\nStaff 1 standing behind him. Staff 4 stated he heard Youth A\nyelling towards Staff 1 and cussing at her but could not recall\nexactly what was being said at that point. Staff 4 stated he saw\nStaff 1 nonverbally calling for help by waving towards other staff\nthat were inside. Staff 4 stated Youth A and Staff 1 came inside\nfrom the side door of the unit and Staff 4 was concerned Youth A\nwas attempting to get to Staff 1 and hit her.

Staff 4 stated he encountered Youth A about 30 or 45\nminutes later and he heard Youth A stating Staff 1 had bit him.\nStaff 4 stated he did not see any injuries or blood on Youth A and\ndid not hear where he may have been bit. Staff 4 stated he has\nworked with Youth A a significant amount and has had concern on\nYouth A’s quick ability to escalate and attempt to hit people as\nwell as his frequency of stating he is being hurt by a staff or youth\nwhen that is not the case. Staff 4 stated he has worked with Staff\n1 many times and he has never had a concern, noting that he has\nseen Youth A seek her out for comfort on more than one occasion\nin the past.\n9",
