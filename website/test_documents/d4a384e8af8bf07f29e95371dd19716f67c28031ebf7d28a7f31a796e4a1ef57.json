    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff member made verbal threats to physically harm youth and\nreferenced gang involvement. Staff member used profanity while\nmaking the threats towards youth. Youth does not feel safe.\nInvestigation I reviewed intake dated 09/01/2023. It states Staff Person 1 made\nverbal threats to physically harm Youth A and referenced gang\ninvolvement. Youth A does not feel safe, and Staff Person 1 has\nbeen reassigned to another building. Complainant is the facility\nChief Administrator and provided no additional information.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Youth A onsite on 09/07/2023 with DHHS Worker.\nHis statement was read to him as noted below in the\nDocumentation section and states it is accurate. He reported\npreviously on an unknown date that Staff Person 1 showed Youth\nA a bullet hole in his arm and informed Youth A how seriously he\ntakes the streets noting how much of a gang-banger Staff Person\n1 is. Youth A then reported that on 08/31/2023 that Staff Person 1\ninformed him that Staff Person 1 is one of the biggest Crypts and\ncalled Youth A, “A (expletive) (expletive) 17-year-old.” Youth A\nsaid Staff Person 1 told him he would show up in the parking lot\nthe day Youth A turned 18. Youth A said he believed Staff Person\n1 meant to kill him.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite on 10/25/2023. His statement was\nread to him as noted below in the Documentation section and\nstates it is accurate. Youth B reports Youth A and Staff Person 1\nwere going back and forth and that both were cussing at each\nother. Youth B does not report Staff Person 1 ever making gang\nrelated threats or referencing gang-like activities as Youth A\nreports during the incident in the day room or at any other time on\nthe unit.\n2",
    "I interviewed Youth C onsite on 10/25/2023. His statement was\nread to him as noted below and states it is accurate. He adds that\nYouth A and Staff Person 1 were going back and forth and\ncussing. Youth C does not report Staff Person 1 ever making gang\nrelated threats or referencing gang-like activities as Youth A\nreports during the incident in the day room or at any other time on\nthe unit.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 via telephone on 09/19/2023. He\nreported being employed as a direct care worker for six years and\nis up to date with training requirements. He said Youth A was\nupset with him for sanctions that got placed on him. Youth A then\nbegan swearing at Staff Person 1 because Youth A felt like he\ndidn’t deserve them. Staff Person 1 reported he did have a back-\nand-forth conversation with Youth A and notes they both had an\naggressive tone. Staff Person 1 states he did not use profanity\nwith Youth A and denies calling Youth A a, “(Expletive)\n(expletive”). Staff Person 1 adamantly states that he has no gang\ninvolvement and has never discussed gang-like activities with the\nresidents. Staff Person 1 went on to state how he grew up in a\nChristian home and that the scar on his arm came from a burn\nand not a gunshot wound.\nI interviewed Staff Person 2 via telephone on 09/18/2023. She\nreported Youth A got upset after Staff Person 1 gave him\nconsequences for a rule infraction. Staff Person 2 reported she\ndoes not recall ‘the verbiage used” but stated that the language\nused by Staff Person 1 was not appropriate. She did not report\nStaff Person 1 threatening Youth A and has no knowledge of Staff\nPerson 1 having any gang-affiliation or mentioning gang-affiliation\nin front of the youth.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 onsite on 09/19/2023. He reported\nupon entry onto the J-Down dayroom that Staff Person 1 was not\nsaying anything, and that Youth A was stating that Staff Person 1\njust called him a “(Expletive expletive) little boy”. He reported\nYouth A was then escorted back to the unit. He did not report\nhaving any knowledge of Staff Person 1 having any gang-\naffiliation or mentioning gang-affiliation in front of residents.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 via telephone on 09/25/2023. He\nreported upon entering the dayroom that Youth A was stating, “So,\nI’m a little (Expletive)” and kept mentioning how staff should not\ndiscipline him in front of other residents. Supervisor 2 then\nreported Youth A was escorted back to the unit. Supervisor 2\n3",
    "reported he does not have knowledge of Staff Person 1 having\nany gang-affiliation or mentioning gang-affiliation in front of\nresidents.\nVideo Review:\nI reviewed video surveillance of the J-Down dayroom at 8:00pm\non 08/31/2023. It shows nine residents sitting with Youth A\nstanding and facing Staff Person 1 who is sitting. Staff Person 2\nis present and is also sitting. Youth A becomes somewhat\nanimated and then Staff Person 1 stands up. Supervisor 1 and\nSupervisor 2 enter the dayroom and escort the nine residents out\nof the dayroom and then begin talking to Youth A who eventually\nexits the dayroom as well.\nDocumentation:\nI reviewed Youth A’s written statement dated 08/31/2023. It states\nstaff was mad and gave me days (consequences) and the two had\nwords. Staff called him a “(expletive) (expletive) little boy” and to\n“(Expletive) me”. Supervisors didn’t do anything, and he wants to\npress charges because he feels unsafe in a place where staff are\nsupposed to keep us safe.\nI reviewed Youth B’s written statement dated 08/31/2023. It states\nStaff gave Youth A a two-day sanction. Youth A gave feedback\nand staff fed into it. Staff could have handled it a lot better in his\nopinion. If you swear at a juvenile, you should expect us to react\nin the same way.\nI reviewed Youth C’s written statement dated 08/31/2023. It\nstates Youth A got upset for “getting days” (sanctions) and that\nStaff Person 1 told Youth A “(Expletive) you” at which point a code\nwas called and when walking out heard someone say they would\n“Beat Youth A’s (Expletive)”.\nI reviewed Youth D’s written statement dated 08/31/2023. It\nstates Staff Peron 1 saying to Youth A, “I’m not about to argue\nwith no (expletive expletive) 17-year-old boy”. Youth A responded\nwith, “Don’t talk to me like that. Who the (expletive) do you think\nyou talking to?” Staff Person 1 responded, “You soft (expletive)\nlittle boy. I will beat your ass. (Expletive) you.”\nI reviewed the facility’s merit system rule violation policy. It states\nverbal and physical abuse or improper treatment of an inmate,\npatient or client of any County institution or department is a merit\nsystem violation of rule. It then notes the Child Caring Institutions\nIntervention standards and prohibitions rule.\n4",
    "Staff Person 1’s personnel record indicates being hired in\n10/2017, receiving orientation, and is up to date on his training\nrequirements.\nAnother State of Michigan department did not have any findings.\nAnalysis There is ample evidence to conclude that Staff Person 1 did use\nprofanity directed at Youth A. Youth A, other residents present,\nand Staff Person 2 reported Staff Person 1 used inappropriate\nlanguage. There is no evidence to indicate Staff Person 1\nthreatened Youth A with gang-affiliation.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2022C0217061 initiated on 09/12/2022; CAP approved 11/30/22\n2023C000020 initiated on 11/20/2022; CAP approved 01/24/23\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an approved corrective action plan no change to the current license\nis recommended.\n10/27/2023\n_____________________________________\nChristopher M Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n11/10/2023\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n5"
