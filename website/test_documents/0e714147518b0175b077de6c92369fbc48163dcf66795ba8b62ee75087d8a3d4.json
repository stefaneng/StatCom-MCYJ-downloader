    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Supervision\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all of the following:\n(a)Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation On 3/28/2024 Youth A presented to the hospital with mental\nhealth concerns and was to receive inpatient psychiatric\ntreatment. On 3/29/2024 Youth A was reevaluated and was ready\nfor discharge and the agency administration did not make\narrangement with the hospital for the youth’s discharge, despite\nthe hospital's repeated attempts to contact the agency to arrange\ndischarge, causing the hospital to believe the youth had been\nabandoned.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 4/3/2024, I interviewed Youth A’s Michigan Department of\nHealth and Human Services-Purchase of Services (MDHHS-\nPOS) Worker 2 by telephone. MDHHS-POS Worker 2 reported\nthe hospital left her a message, an email and contacted her\nsupervisor on Friday (3/29/2024). MDHHS-POS Worker 2 did not\nget the telephone message or email until Monday (4/1/2024). The\nHospital Social Worker (HSW) also called her on 4/1/2024. The\nHSW reported Youth A needed to be picked up from the hospital,\nand if not, the hospital would call children protective services\n(CPS). The HSW admitted the hospital had previously indicated\nthey were going to admit Youth A, but on Friday, the hospital\nassessed Youth A could do a partial stay and Youth A would\ncome to the hospital for outpatient treatment.\nMDHHS-POS Worker 2 reported the hospital reported they could\nnot get in touch with a supervisor/ administrative staff at Spectrum\nrelated to Youth A’s discharge. MDHHS-POS Worker 2 reported\nSpectrum had workers on shift at the hospital with Youth A. She\nsaid she spoke with a worker (she didn’t say who) while the staff\nwere onsite and this person tried to call their supervisor without\nsuccess (no answer). MDHHS-POS Worker 2 said she knew the\n2",
    "Case Manager was out. She did not understand why no other\nadministrative staff was reachable.\nOn 4/5/2024 I interviewed the Case Manager about this allegation\nface-to-face at the agency’s administrative office in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Worker 1 (MDHHS Worker 3 was also present\nobserving the interview). Case Manager said she was out of\ntown on leave from 3/29/2024- 4/2/2024. She said on 3/29/2024\nshe had received a phone call from Hospital Worker 1 (she could\nonly recall his first name) about discharge planning for Youth A.\nShe called Hospital Worker 1 back and spoke with them on\n3/29/2024 around 6:40pm. Hospital Worker 1 wanted the Case\nManager to call Hospital Worker 2 (whose name the Case\nManager could not recall). The Case Manager phoned Hospital\nWorker 2 that same day and Hospital Worker 2 told her to call\nHospital Worker 1. The Case Manager reported since she had\nalready spoken to Hospital Worker 1 on 3/29/2024 and had\nadvised Hospital Worker 1 to contact the Case Manager’s\nsupervisor, she did not make another call to Hospital Worker 1.\nThe Case Manager said she did not provide her supervisor’s\nname or number as she assumed the hospital had the Chief\nAdministrator’s (CA) and other agency staff contact information on\nfile. She said, if the hospital had emailed her, (which she\ndiscovered they had on 3/29/2024) her out of office notification\nwould deploy and give instruction as to whom to contact in her\nabsence, that being the CA.\nThe Case Manager reported there is not a 24-hour contact\nnumber and that the hospital had her work telephone number and\nthe CA’s work number. The Case Manager said on 3/29/2024 she\nalso reached out to the CA by text; and advised the CA the\nhospital had contacted her about Youth A on 3/29/2024. She did\nnot recall whether she told the CA the call was about Youth A\nbeing discharged. She said when she spoke with the hospital\nworkers, she thought they wanted to know if Youth A could come\nback to Spectrum’s IL home; but she now understands it was\nabout Youth A being released from the hospital.\nThe Case Manager reported Spectrum has staff to supervise a\nyouth when a youth is at or admitted to a hospital. This happened\nwith Youth A’ past hospital stays. To her knowledge staff were at\nthe hospital during Youth A’s entire stay. When asked whether\nstaff were told what to do about a youth’s discharge, the Case\nManager reported that staff would know this would be coordinated\nby other supervisory staff.\n3",
    "On 4/2/2024 I spoke with the Chief Administrator (CA) about this\nallegation by telephone. I interviewed the CA face-to-face at the\nagency’s administrative office on 4/5/2024 in collaboration with\nMDHHS Worker 1 (MDHHS Worker 3 was also present observing\nthe interview). The CA reported being surprised about the\ncomplaint. She said youth workers had been at the hospital\nmonitoring Youth A since Youth A went to the hospital on\n3/28/2024 related to the last incident of Youth A taking edibles.\nShe said the hospital had initially indicated they were admitting\nYouth A; and prior to this Spectrum was connecting with MDHHS\nabout Spectrum’s Independent Living (IL) placement not being\nappropriate for Youth A. The CA reported she had advised\nMDHHS, Spectrum could not accommodate Youth A for 30 days.\nSpectrum was awaiting a TDM (Team Decision Meeting) that was\nset for 4/3/2024; at which time they could have Youth A with\nanother placement.\nThe CA admitted the Case Manager contacted her on 3/29/2024\nreporting the hospital contacted the Case Manager. The CA\nreported there were no other conservations with the Case\nManager. The CA did not say whether or not she knew that the\ncontact was about Youth A’s discharge. Nor did she report\nSpectrum was not open to Youth A being discharged back to\nSpectrum. Her response was she contacted Spectrum’s\nResidential Supervisor and advised that supervisor the CA\nneeded to talk with MDHHS about the CA’s concerns with Youth\nA’s continued placement with Spectrum prior to accepting the\ndischarge. The CA acknowledged receipt of an email from the\nhospital about Youth A’s readiness for discharge on 4/1/2024. She\nsaid she advised the hospital that the agency needed to talk with\nMDHHS. She asked the hospital for more time related to Youth\nA’s discharge. The hospital asked what her timeframe was, but\nshe was not aware of the hospital’s question until the next day.\nShe reported she was trying to work Youth A’s placement situation\nout with MDHHS. She said she spoke with the MDHHS\nSupervisor on 4/1/2024 between 5:00-6:00pm; and that supervisor\nindicated the MDHHS Supervisor would need to speak with her\ndirect supervisor about the matter. The MDHHS Supervisor\nadvised the CA afterwards that per the MDHHS Supervisor’s\ncontact with their supervisor, Spectrum must submit a 30-day\nremoval request to have Youth A’s placement moved. The CA\nreported on 4/1/2024 she informed her administrator of MDHHS’s\ndecision about Youth A and she made it clear to the hospital they\nwere taking Youth A back. The CA did not clarify how she had\nmade that clear. She said on 4/2/2024 she called the staff to tell\nthem to advise the hospital Spectrum was able to complete the\n4",
    "discharge. On 4/2/2024 she and the Residential Supervisor also\nsaw the email from the hospital that was mentioned prior, and she\nreplied to it. The CA said she also spoke with a female hospital\nsocial worker on 4/2/2024 and she advised this person Spectrum\nwould be taking Youth A back.\nThe CA reported Spectrum staff is/were aware they could not\nbring Youth A from the hospital prior to an approval from their\nsupervisor or her. She denied the agency abandoning Youth A at\nthe hospital.\nThe CA did not perceive the agency’s delayed actions pertaining\nto Youth A ‘s discharge as not appropriate. Nor that there may\nhave been some confusion by the hospital as to what the agency\nwould be doing related to Youth A. The CA accepted the\nindication it could be seen that way; because when a youth is\nready for discharge, arrangement for such is to happen swiftly.\nShe thought she had made it clear to the hospital on 4/1/2024\nthey were taking Youth A back, though she did not clarify how she\nhad done that.\nOn 4/3/2024 I interviewed the Hospital Social Worker (HSW) by\ntelephone. The HSW reported on 3/29/2024 at approximately\n4:00pm, the hospital told Spectrum staff onsite that Youth A was\nready for discharge. The staff attempted to reach the Case\nManager more than once without success. The HSW reported at\napproximately 10:00pm the Case Manager called the hospital and\nreported the Case Manager would contact the Guidance Center to\nauthorize mental health care for Youth A. Additionally, the Case\nManager was going to speak with her supervisor, but the Case\nManager, nor another Spectrum supervisor, or administrator\ncalled the hospital back that day. The HSW reported over the\nweekend their department continued their efforts to facilitate Youth\nA’s discharge. He said his co-worker left messages for the Case\nManager on Saturday and Sunday. The HSW did not report\nhaving an on-call number for the agency. The hospital’s contact to\nthe Case Manager was by cell phone and email. They had also\nspoke with a prior provider of Youth A, in hopes of facilitating a\nplan for Youth A.\nThe HSW reported after failed attempts to execute Youth A’s\ndischarge over the weekend, on Monday morning he sent an\nemail to MDHHS staff and the Spectrum CA asking about a\ntimeline for Youth A’s discharge. Spectrum did not respond, and\nlater that afternoon the HSW sent another email to MDHHS, the\nCase Manager, and CA asking if Youth A had been abandoned.\n5",
    "The HSW said the CA responded around 2:40pm with a vague\nresponse, “something about being in discussions with MDHHS”.\nOn Tuesday after 2:00pm the CA responded indicating they would\nmake arrangements for Youth A’s discharge.\nThe HSW reported Spectrum never said they would not or could\nnot take Youth A back. He also confirmed Spectrum had staff\nonsite at the hospital supervising Youth A all weekend. But those\nstaff reported they could not connect with a supervisor related to\nYouth A’s discharge plan. The HSW reported he learned via Youth\nWorker (YW)1 they/staff onsite at the hospital had information\nabout what was going on, but they were not to update the hospital.\nThe HSW said per YW 1 and the last email from the CA, he\nsurmised the agency was having discussions about whether\nYouth A would or would not be returning to the agency’s program,\nbut they were not telling the hospital this information.\nOn 4/22/2024, I interviewed Youth Worker (YW) 1 by telephone.\nShe reported she and other staff were supervising Youth A the\nentire time Youth A was in the hospital. She worked the morning\nshifts 7:00am- 3:00pm and sometime 4:00pm. YW 1 said she\ncould not speak to the other staff’s location during their time at the\nhospital, but she was always in Youth A’s room during her entire\nshift. She reported not being able to speak to whether staff could\nreach a supervisor related to Youth A’s discharge, but reported\nthe Residential Supervisor also completed some shifts. She\nreported the administration makes the decisions about youth’s\ndischarge planning.\nOn 3/28/2024 I interviewed Youth A at the hospital related to\nspecial investigation 2024SIC000274, and just prior to receipt of\nthis complaint. At that time the Hospital Psychiatrist reported\nYouth A would be admitted. A staff person was supervising Youth\nA at this time. I attempted contact with Youth A after her\ndischarge from the hospital, return to Spectrum independent living\nhome, but thereafter she was sent to Havenwyck and contact was\nnot able to occur.\nDocument Review:\n• Youth A’s MISACWIS case record which showed she is a\npermanent court ward, who has had numerous placements,\ninclusive of a number of past residential placements.\n• A copy of a 3/23/2024, 3/24/2024, and 3/25/2024 unusual\nincident report related to Youth A’s hospital visits due to\nself-harming/suicidal ideations, and the Hospital Visit\nSummaries related to those visits.\n6",
    "• A copy of the email chain from the hospital to MDHHS,\nwhich included the Case Manager and the CA at different\ntimes as recipients. These emails showed:\n✓ On 4/1/2024(8:16am) the HSW contacted\nMDHHS-POS Worker 2, the MDHHS Supervisor,\nanother MDHHS Staff and the Case Manager\nadvising that Youth A was ready for discharge\nfrom the emergency department, and asking when\nYouth A would be picked up.\n✓ On 4/1/2024(12:57pm) the MDHHS Supervisor\nemailed the HSW, (with a copy to the other\nrecipients on the HSW first email), asking whether\nYouth A had been picked up. The HSW replied to\nall (which now included the CA) Youth A was still\nat the hospital.\n✓ A 4/1/2024(2:22pm) reply from the MDHHS\nSupervisor asking for the CA’s assistance with the\ndischarge plan, since the Case Manager is out.\n✓ On 4/1/2024 (3:11pm) The HSW seeking a time for\nYouth A’s pick up after being advised by the CA\nthe agency is in discussion with MDHHS about\nYouth A’s placement and what’s in her best\ninterest, and will respond back as soon as\npossible; thereon the HSW asked about the time\nframe for the discussion, no reply back that day\nfrom the CA.\n✓ A 4/1/2024 (3:42pm) from the Hospital\nPsychiatrist to the HSW (with a copy to the other\nprior recipients) advising all that soon there will be\npressure from physicians related to Youth A’s\ndischarge and for the department/Spectrum to\nremedy the situation. Thereafter, another email by\nthe HSW indicating a concern Youth A has been\nabandoned.\n✓ A 4/1/2024(7:18am) email from the HSW advising\nas the Youth A has been ready for discharge since\n3/29/2024 and the hospital had to make a referral\naround the child likely being abandoned by the\nagency. Then a response by the CA (at 8:07am)\nthat Youth A has not been abandoned, the agency\nstaff has been at the hospital the entire time.\nAdditionally, it has been in discussion with MDHHS\nas previously mentioned; and at this point since\nthere is no other placement available for Youth A,\nYouth A will be returning to the independent living\nplacement with Spectrum; Spectrum will follow the\n7",
    "safety plan and discharge plan provided by the\nhospital.\nAnalysis The agency is not in compliance with the rule:\nIt is established by way of individuals interviewed that the agency\nprovided staff supervision of Youth A while she was at the\nhospital. It is also established that the hospital indicated Youth A\nwas ready for discharge to her placement on 3/29/2024; and after\nshe wasn’t discharged, the hospital sought MDHHS assistance\nand pressed the need for Youth A’s release from the hospital to\nthe agency’s Case Manager and CA via email on 4/1/2024. The\nagency did not have clear communication with the hospital about\nYouth A’s discharge and did not arrange for her discharge to her\nplacement until 4/2/2024.\nThe agency did not work promptly with the hospital related to\nYouth A’s discharge, return to placement and allowed Youth A to\nremain at the hospital in a limbo state from 3/29/2024 until\n4/2/2024.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the facility’s current licensing status is recommended.\nMay 14, 2024\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 30, 2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n8"
