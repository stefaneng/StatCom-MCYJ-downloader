The agency on call worker was unable to be reached\nduring this time. When worker and supervisor were contacted, they indicated\n2",
    "there was no one working until after 01/01/2022. It appears that there I not an\nemergency plan for cases or staff were not adequately aware of the process.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A, age 5, is currently placed in the home of her maternal aunt where she has\nbeen residing since 11/05/2021. Youth A ingested a half bottle of liquid Tylenol on\n12/27/2021 and was taken to the hospital.\nThe reporting source had no additional information to add to this allegation. She\ndid report there were a case conference meeting held on 01/05/2022 and a Team\nDecision Making meeting (TMD) held on 01/12/2022 with Youth A and her\ncaregiver with the agency and governmental worker.\nI interviewed the agency caseworker (Staff 1) regarding the allegation. She\nreported she received a telephone call from another governmental worker on\n12/29/2021 regarding Youth A who is on her case load. Staff 1 reports that during\nthe call the governmental worker expressed concern about the office protocol\nduring the holiday but failed to mention Youth A’s name or the nature of the incident\nshe was concerned about. Staff 1 said she explained to the worker that the office is\nclosed due to the holidays, however telephone calls to the agency are transferred\nto the supervisor on call. She said the governmental worker never mentioned to her\nthat there was a complaint on a child or a home. Staff 1 said the governmental\nworker was only concerned about the office being closed until 01/03/2022 and\nrequested the name of the agency supervisor. She said she provided the name\nand telephone number of the agency supervisor and they hung up. Staff 1 said she\nwas contacted by her supervisor on 12/29/2021 who provided her with Youth A's\nname and the nature of a complaint. She said she went to the home when she\nreceived the information on 12/29/2021 and spoke with the caregiver and Youth A.\nShe said a safety plan was put in place for the caregiver and Youth A. She said\nsince she was assigned to Youth A’s case, she discussed with the caregiver the\nimportance of contacting the agency or Staff 1 in the case of an emergency\nbecause the caregiver had Staff 1 telephone number.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 regarding the allegation. She reported on 12/29/2021\naround 1:30pm she received a text message from Staff 1 informing her that a\ngovernmental worker wanted to talk with her regarding Youth A. Supervisor 1 said\nshe contacted the telephone number provided to her from Staff 1. She said she was\ninformed by the governmental worker there was a complaint made on the home\nregarding Youth A on 12/27/21 and that the governmental worker had tried to\ninform the agency to no avail. She said the governmental worker explained to her\nthat she sent an email but did not receive a bounce back saying the office was\nclosed or that Supervisor 1 was out of the office. Supervisor 1 said she apologized\nto the worker as she was the supervisor on call and had not received a message.\nSupervisor 1 explained that the telephone system in the building had not been\nworking properly for months but the agency assumed it was fixed before the start of\n3",
    "the holiday season. Supervisor 1 said she apologized repeatedly assuring that an\naway email had been set up on the agency telephone prior to closing the office.\nSupervisor 1 said she explained the after-hour phone protocol to the government\nworker. Supervisor 1 explained that the agency receptionist is required to check\nthe phone for any messages. The receptionist then forwards the messages to the\nsupervisor’s extension. Supervisor 1 stated she explained that if someone calls, the\ncall goes directly to the supervisor extension which in turns goes directly to the\nsupervisor cell phones. However, due to technical problems with the telephone\nsystem, this process did not work properly.\nSupervisor 1 said she informed the governmental worker that the situation would be\ntaken care of immediately with Youth A. She said she informed Staff 1 the nature\nof the complaint and requested her to go to the home on 12/29/2021, to complete a\nwellness check and develop a safety plan for Youth A.\nSupervisor 1 said the caregiver of Youth A had her assigned agency caseworker\ntelephone number and she was aware that she could call the caseworker (Staff 1)\nat any time regarding Youth A. She said the caregiver was trained on the agency\npolicies and procedures and signed documentation stating she understood the\nprocess. She said the caregiver called another government worker to report that\nYouth A had ingested a half of bottle of liquid Tylenol and was taken to the hospital.\nShe said when Staff 1 spoke with the caregiver, the caregiver reported she acted\nabruptly and called another governmental worker because that was the first number\nshe found at the time. The caregiver did not contact Homes for Black Children\nregarding Youth A and the Tylenol incident.\nI interviewed the Chief Administrator regarding the allegation. She reported the\nagency was having issues with the telephone system prior to this incident. She said\nsince the incident, she has contacted the technology company to work on the\nsystem because when messages were left, the messages were being erased and\nnot saved therefore, the receptionist were not getting the messages to leave for the\non-call supervisor. She said the company technician came out, worked on the\nsystem and provided training to the receptionist and now phone calls can be\nanswered remotely.\nI reviewed another governmental worker report regarding the allegation. The\nfollowing information were noted from the report:\n The caregiver called the governmental worker and reported that Youth A had\ningested a half bottle of Tylenol. It was reported the incident occurred on\n12/27/2021, around 11:00pm but then the story changed and said the\nincident occurred around 6pm. The caregiver delayed taking Youth A to the\nhospital and did not have an explanation of how Youth A swallowed the\nmedication.\n It was discovered that the Tylenol was in liquid form.\n4",
    " The caregiver reported that Youth A was staying overnight with her maternal\ngrandmother’s house (MGM). The MGM called the caregiver and reported\nbetween 6-7pm she had left a bottle of children’s liquid Tylenol on a counter\nand discovered Youth A had retrieved and opened the bottle. It was unsure\nif Youth A ingested the medication or how much medication was in the\nbottle. The MGM gave Youth A a glass of milk and watched her closely.\n Youth A fell asleep and woke up around 11:00pm complaining of abdominal\npain. The caregiver picked Youth A up and took her to the emergency room.\n Upon an assessment the medical doctor ran blood work and tests and\nadvised that Youth A’s Tylenol levels were below the recommendation\ndosage for her age and weight.\n Youth A was discharged with instruction to follow up with her pediatrician.\n Based on another governmental worker’s report, there were insufficient\nevidence of improper supervision or medical neglect of Youth A.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is suggested that Homes for Back Children revisit the procedure for reporting\nunusual incidents with this foster parent. It is also suggested that the agency\ntelephone numbers are posted in a place where the foster parent have easy\naccess to obtaining the phone number when and if the need arises.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12403 Policy and procedures.\n(2) The policies and procedures shall cover at least all of\nthe following areas:\n(f) Unusual incidents\n5",
    "ANALYSIS:\nThe agency Supervisor 1 and Chief Administrator admitted that\nthe agency had a faulty telephone system during the Christmas\nholidays. The telephone system was not saving the messages\nand erasing the messages as well causing the receptionist to\nnot send the messages to the supervisor.\nThe agency had an emergency system in place but had a faulty\ntelephone system, which they were aware of prior to the holiday\nseason prevented them from addressing an emergency in a\ntimely fashion. The emergency call came in 12/27/21, and they\nwere not able to address it until 12/29/21 due to the faulty\ntelephone system. The agency is found in noncompliance for\nnot making sure their telephone system was in proper working\ncondition prior to closing the office for the holidays. The\nadministration was aware they were having issues with the\ntelephone system.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that Homes\nfor Black Children license remains unchanged.\n03/01/2022\n________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 2, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n6"
