No exception was\ndocumented.\nSibling visits\n One file did not have sibling visits documented for January and August 2019.\n One file did not have sibling visits documented from February to May 2019.\nUnannounced visits\n One file did not have unannounced visits completed from October 2018- July\n2019. The supervisor reported that the visits were all unannounced, but\ndocumented incorrectly.\nThis is a repeat violation from the 1/7/19 interim review (CAP approved\n1/29/19), 10/4/17 renewal (CAP approved 11/7/17), and 10/4/16 interim (CAP\napproved 11/30/16).\nR 400.12405 Change of placement\n(3) The agency shall document all of the following in the child’s\nrecord before a change of placement…\nTwo of eight foster care case files did not have the proper documentation for a\nchange of placement (DHHS 69).\nThis is a repeat violation from the 1/7/19 interim inspection (CAP approved\n1/29/19), and the 10/4/17 renewal (CAP approved 11/7/17)\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance with all additional ISEP requirements, except for the following:\n5",
    "ISEP 6.24 Caseload, Foster Care Workers\nPage 26\n(a) 95% of foster care caseworkers shall have a caseload of no\nmore than 15 children.\nPer the caseload count on 12/28/18, only 86% of foster care staff had caseloads of\n15 children or less. Per the caseload count on 10/9/19, only 75% of foster care staff\nhad caseloads of 15 children or less. During the on-site visit for this review, it was\ndetermined that caseloads were at 19, 18, 17, and 15.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a MDHHS Contract violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MDHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included in\nsection 1. The facility is in compliance with all additional MDHHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements except for the following:\nFOM 722-08C Parent Agency Treatment Plan- required participation in\nPage 2 development\nWhen completed, obtain all signatures as appropriate, including\nthose of parent(s)/guardian(s), foster care worker, supervisor,\nfoster parent, caregiver, any youth age 14 and older and in the\ncase of placement agency foster care cases, the local DHS office\ndesignee.\nSix of eight foster care USP/PATP were missing required signatures.\nThis is a repeat violation from the 1/7/19 interim review (CAP approved\n1/29/19), 10/4/17 renewal (CAP approved 11/7/17), and the 10/4/16 interim (CAP\napproved 11/30/16)\nFOM 722-06H Timely Entry of Caseworker Contacts\nAll caseworker contacts must be entered in MiSACWIS; this\nincludes attempted contacts and missed appointments, and all\npertinent information obtained must be summarized and included\nin the appropriate section of the case service plan.\nAll face-to-face contacts must be entered in MiSACWIS, within five\nbusiness days of the contact.\nThree of eight case files had contacts that were not entered within the required\ntimeframe.\nFile one: Almost all June, July and August contacts were entered on 8/27/19.\nFile two & three: All contacts were entered. However, they were entered outside of\nthe 5 day requirement.\n6",
    "This is a repeat violation from the 1/7/19 interim review (CAP approved 1/29/19)\nand 10/4/16 interim review (CAP approved 10/30/16).\nFOM 722-06B Family Team Meeting\nPage 1-7\nFTMs must occur within the required time frames as outlined…\nFour FTMs were missing the completed 1105 report.\nOne FTM did not occurred prior to a USP in August 2019.\nThis is a repeat violation from the 1/7/19 interim review (CAP approved 1/29/19)\nand the 10/4/17 renewal (CAP approved 11/7/17)\nFOM 722-03B Relative Engagement and Placement\nPages 14-19\n(Page 14) The DHS-588, Initial Relative Safety Screen, is used to\nexamine basic qualifications of a prospective caregiver and to\nidentify immediate safety concerns in the caregiver's home. The\nRelative Safety Screen must be completed and approved prior to,\nbut no more than 30 calendar days before a child's placement. 4\n(Page 19) The Relative Placement Home Study (3130A) including\nall clearances must be completed and approved annually (within\n365 days of the previous Relative Placement Home Study\ncompletion date) for unlicensed caregivers. An approved Relative\nPlacement Home Study is valid for one year.\nTwo relative placement were found to be in violation of this policy.\nOne relative accepted placement on 10/18/18. A 588 safety screen was not\ncompleted until 11/1/18. It was noted that this was a court ordered placement,\nhowever a safety screen is still required at the time of placement.\nOne relative had a 3130A which was last updated on 9/12/18. The agency is in\nviolation as an update is due annually and one was not completed as of October\n2019.\nFOM 801 Medical Passport\nPage 11-13\nAll medical information within the medical passport must be current\nand updated at least quarterly to reflect the child's current and\ncomplete health information…\nFour of eight case files did not have medical passports as required.\nFile One: The file only had one medical passport during the past year.\n7",
    "File Two: The file was missing three quarterly updated passports for the past year.\nFile Three: The file was missing a quarterly report for January 2019.\nFile four: A quarterly updated medical passport was not completed from February to\nJuly 2019.\nThis is a repeat violation from the 1/7/19 interim inspection (CAP approved\n1/29/19) and 10/4/17 renewal (CAP approved 11/7/17) .\nFOM 722-03 Placement Exception Request\nPage 14-16\nCaseworkers must complete a placement exception request (PER)\nwhen there is a need to waive placement standards to maintain\nsibling and caregiver bonds or to meet the medical, emotional, and\npsychological needs of children in care. PERs must be completed,\nreviewed, and approved in MiSACWIS.\nOne of eight foster care files was missing a PER for a sibling split during July-\nAugust 2019.\nANALYST SAFETY CONCERNS\nSafety Alert 1: The infant is currently sleeping in a drop side crib. The foster\nplacement indicated that they were unaware this was a safe sleep issue. The foster\nhome stated that previous to the crib that the child was sleeping in a pack and play\nsince she was placed with them. There is not a variance request in MiSACWIS for\nthe child to sleep in a pack and play instead of a crib.\nUpon receipt of this alert, the foster parent was contacted by the agency. An\nappropriate crib was placed in the home as observed by the foster care worker on\n7/9/19. The infant has slept in the crib every night since that time.\nSafety Alert 2: The relative placement indicated that they do not have a carbon\nmonoxide detector.\nUpon receiving this notification, the agency contacted the relative caregiver and a\ncarbon monoxide detector was installed.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nMiSACWIS documents: The agency asked about utilizing the “documents” section in\nMiSACWIS case records, for all case documents. The agency was reminded that\nthat MiSACWIS flow chart must be utilized when uploading documents.\n8",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nInformation was relayed to the administrator and supervisors, regarding the\ninterviews conducted with foster care staff. Staff reported having difficulty\ncommunicating with co-workers in children’s services at the initiation of cases. They\nexpressed that they are two very different units and this divide sets the tone for new\ncases. Workers also reported not getting vital documents in a timely manner at the\nearly stages of the case. The Supervisors expressed that they recently had a\nmeeting with the children’s services supervisor, and put a plan together to address\nthese concerns. Several strategies were identified, which will be utilized to bring the\ntwo units together.\nIt was also shared with supervisors that caseworkers are overwhelmed by the case\nload sizes. Supervisors expressed that two staff are currently on medical leave and\none staff left the agency recently. The supervisors are confident that once they are\nback to a full staff, case numbers will return to normal. Until then, Supervisors are\ndoing what they can to support and assist their staff.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP, approved 1/29/19, was required after the 1/7/19 interim evaluation. While\nthere were some repeat violations during this review period, the agency has shown\nimprovement in many other areas. No significant safety issues have been identified\nand all violations appear to be correctable with a Corrective Action Plan, and lower\ncaseloads.\n9",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, ISEP requirements, or MDHHS contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nOctober 17, 2019\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 22, 2019\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n10"
