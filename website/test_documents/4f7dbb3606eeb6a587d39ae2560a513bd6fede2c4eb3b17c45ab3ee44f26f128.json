Staff\nwere aware and safety planned to keep the youth in different groups within the\nhouse. However, youth were still able to engage in intercourse when staff were\ndistracted. A request was made to move one youth to a different house and the\nfacility has not responded.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn May 5, 2021 it was reported to me that 22 youth out of 44 had tested positive for\nCOVID-19. Based on this information, this special investigation was not completed\nwith in-person contacts, rather completed virtually.\nOn May 6, 2021 I interviewed Chief Administrator 3, Youth A (female, age 15), and\nAdministrator 4 with DHHS Investigator 1. All were interviewed using Microsoft\nTeams.\nYouth A said on three occasions she and Youth B (male) had sexual intercourse at\nthe facility. She said the first occasion was on March 23, 2021. Youth A and Youth B\nwere in the common area and Former Staff 10 was supervising.\nYouth A said she and Youth B “had sex” on Saturday, April 24, 2021 and on Sunday,\nApril 25, 2021 in the bathroom on the living unit. Youth A said both times she had\nsex with Youth B Direct Care Worker 5, Direct Care Worker 6, and Direct Care\nWorker 7 were supervising seven youth. Youth A said that she and Youth B did not\nget caught on Saturday but ended up getting caught on Sunday.\nOn May 12, 2021, another Microsoft Teams meeting was set up with DHHS\nInvestigator 1 and Eagle Village. We reviewed training and discipline of Direct Care\nSupervisor 8, Direct Care Worker 5, Direct Care Worker 6 and Direct Care Worker 7.\nDirect Care Worker 5 was interviewed she said she and Direct Care Worker 6 and\nDirect Care Worker 7 were supervising 8 or 9 youth. Direct Care Worker 5 said she\nwas unaware of Youth B need for one-to-one supervision. Direct Care Worker 5 said",
    "that when Youth A came out of the bathroom and the door was closed, the light was\nturned off, then the light came back on, as seen under the door.\nProgram Manager 12 was interviewed by Microsoft Teams on May 12, 2021. He\nsaid that Youth B was on a one-to-one “as needed”. He said the one-to-one was\nbased on Youth B being assaultive.\nEagle Village requested one-to-one supervisor of Youth B in a request dated March\n23, 2021, which requested up 16 hours of one-to one per day “as needed”. Eagle\nVillage billed for 91.5 hours in March 2021 and 214.05 hours in April 2021.One-to-\none hours started in March on the 25th. Eagle Village did not bill for one-to-one hours\nbetween April 22 and April 26th. They billed for 13 hours of one-to-one on Friday,\nApril 22, 2021 and 11.5 hours on Monday, April 26, 2021.\nAdministrator 4 was interviewed by telephone on June 15, 2021. She said the\ncriteria for one to one for Youth B was based on his assaultive and aggressive\nbehavior. The decision to put Youth B on one to one was made by Direct Care\nSupervisor 8 and Youth B’s Therapist 13. Administrator 4 said the decision for one to\none was communicated by Direct Care Supervisor 8. Administrator 4 said the one to\none was for aggressive behavior and not based on Youth A and Youth B’s sexual\nbehavior. She said that Youth B was only on one to one when it was deemed\nimportant to keep other youth, staff and Youth B safe from Youth B’s assaultive\nbehavior.\nThe letter requesting one to one, dated March 23, 2021, for Youth B read in part as\nfollows:\nThis letter is to request compensation for individual supervision of (Youth B)\nduring waking hours, maximum of 16 hours, as needed. This request is due to\nthe recent behavioral/aggressive behaviors that (Youth B) has been displaying.\n(Youth B) has been struggling with demonstrating safe and consistent positive\nbehaviors. He continues to become escalated quickly, resulting in him being\nphysically assaultive towards staff and on one occasion a peer. (Youth B)\nassaulted staff on the following dates: 2/21/2021, 3/10/2021, and 3/17/2021.\nCharges were pressed by staff on the 3/17/2021 incident. On 3/22/2012, (Youth\nB) physically assaulted a peer while they were in school, during this incident he\nalso bit a staff member in the head when the staff was attempting to get (Youth B)\noff the other peer that he was attacking. Charges were pressed by this peer on\n(Youth B) on 3/23/2021. (Youth B)’s behaviors have continued to fluctuate with\nremaining unsafe and assaultive when he becomes upset.\nDirect Care Worker 7 was interviewed over Microsoft Teams on May 12, 2021. He\nsaid he lost track of Youth B and was checking every room on Sunday, April 25,\n2021. He said he looked for two minutes. Direct Care Worker 7 said he thought that\nYouth B was in the bathroom first, then Youth A went in while Youth B was in there.",
    "The next staff to be interviewed was Direct Care Supervisor 8 over Microsoft Teams\non May 12, 2021. Direct Care Supervisor 8 said he thought Youth A and Youth B\nwere acting suspicious on March 23, 2021 and he then reviewed the video and saw\nthat Youth A and Youth B had sexual intercourse on the couch in the television area.\nDirect Care Supervisor 8 said he reviewed the video on March 23, 2021 right after\nhe felt Youth A and Youth B were acting suspicious. Direct Care Supervisor 8 then\nconfronted Youth A and Youth B and they were required to stay apart with staff\nbetween them. The letter requesting one to one for Youth B was dated March 23,\n2021. This letter cited three assaults on staff and one assault on another youth as\nthe reason for the one-to-one request.\nFormer Staff 10 was supposed to be supervising Youth A and Youth B and was\nsitting nearby. Direct Care Supervisor 8 said that Youth B was on a one-to-one\nsupervision as needed. Direct Care Supervisor 8 said he was not working on April\n24 and April 25, but Youth B was still on a one-to-one as needed on those dates.\nDirect Care Worker 6 was interviewed over Microsoft Teams with DHHS Investigator\n1 on May 12, 2021. He said he was in the office area doing paperwork on Sunday\nwhen Youth B was caught coming out of the bathroom after Youth A was in there.\nHe said that there were nine youth and three staff at the facility.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency’s\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Despite having three staff to nine youth, staff were not providing\nthe required supervision of Youth A and Youth B, evidenced by\nthe youth having sexual contact three times over a two-day\nperiod, twice after the facility was aware it occurred the first\ntime. Additionally, the facility lacked sufficient supervision and\noversight of the youth, staff and unit, evidenced by the\nsupervisor being aware of the initial instance of sexual acting\nout and not placing Youth B on one-to-one supervision, not\nimplementing a safety plan and not providing supervision to staff\nto prevent further incidents.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED",
    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nI received an email from DHHS Worker 11 which had a letter from Youth A to Youth\nB. The envelope was addressed by Youth A to Youth B in his new placement. Eagle\nVillage did not have the authority to provide Youth B’s contact information to Youth\nA. Youth A, age 15 is below the age of consent for sexual behaviors in Michigan.\nYouth B is above the age of consent.\nThe letter from Youth A to Youth B was dated May 7, 2021 and it was postmarked\non May 17, 2021. Youth B was placed in another facility on May 6, 2021. The letter\nwas in an Eagle Village envelope and it was after the three incidents of sexual\nintercourse between Youth A and Youth B.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4130 Privacy and confidentiality.\n(1) An institution shall assure resident and parent privacy\nand confidentiality and shall protect residents from\nexploitation.\nANALYSIS: Eagle Village did not protect Youth B or Youth A by providing\nunauthorized contact information.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nUnder Eagle Village’s policy for compliance with the child protection law it reads in\npart:\n1. Immediately notify the DHHS Child Protective Services--Centralized Intake\nDivision at (855)444-3911 and the referring worker by phone that physical\nabuse, sexual abuse, or neglect has been suspected.\nEagle Village was aware of three times that a youth under their direct supervision\nhad sexual relations with one another in the residence with staff present, and they\ndid not follow their policy of reporting to central intake.",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4131 Compliance with child protection law; development of plan\nrequired.\nThe licensee shall develop and implement a written plan to\nassure compliance with the child protection law, 1975 PA\n238, MCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nANALYSIS: Eagle Village did not follow their policy regarding compliance\nwith the child protection law.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that there be no change to the licensing status of this private\nchild caring institution upon the receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan.\nJune 15, 2021\n________________________________________\nDon Collier Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 16, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager"
