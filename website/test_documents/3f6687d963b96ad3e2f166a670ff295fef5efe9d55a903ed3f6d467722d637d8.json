CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Nothing this inspection.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThis incident related to a complaint received against a foster home on\n7/26/2023.The complaint alleged that the foster father had a video of himself\nsexually maltreating his 13-year-old adoptive son. Additionally, that the foster\nfather inappropriately touched the private parts of his 11year old adoptive son.\nDuring the investigation the foster parent denied the allegations. During interviews\nwith both children by the agency worker, as well as via Kids-Talk interviews, the\nchildren reported inappropriate sexual maltreatment by the foster father. The\nchildren were removed from the home. The agency found the foster parent in\nviolation of the foster parent reporting rule because the foster parent did not report\nhis arrest related to the allegation. The agency also found the foster parent in\nviolation of the applicant/license qualification rule, based on the evidence at hand.\nRevocation of the foster parent’s foster home license was recommended.\nThe agency appeared to have acted appropriately in this incident. The agency\nadhered to all departmental requirements.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period.\nThe first corrective action plan related to the agency’s Interim inspection where it\nreceived the following rule and policy violations:\n• R400.12212(2)(a) Personnel records.\n• R400.12306(4) Application request.",
    "• R400.12324(8) Reevaluation.\n• R300.12413(1)(c) (ii) Medical and dental policy.\n• ISEP 4.22 MIASCWIS (Commitment 22).\n• FOM 722-8 Case Service Plans-Overview, Types, And Time frames.\nSupervisor Approval.\n• FOM 722-8D Treatment plan. Agreement and signature.\n• FOM 722-8E Foster Care/Juvenile Justice Action Summary.\n• FOM 802 Mental Health and Behavioral and Developmental Need of Children\nunder supervision of MDHHS.\nAs it relates to the agency’s efforts to achieve this corrective action plan, the\nagency provided documentation showing its use of spreadsheets to track\nperformance evaluations, medical health screens, and initial medical passport due\ndates for submission of that document to the caregivers. Not all of these tools\nindicated success. Other actions indicated in the corrective action plan, such as\nutilization of a licensing upload checklist, routing of service plans within seven days,\nand trauma screening completions at the time of the five-day case transfer\nconference between children protective services and foster care were items shown\nby way of the file reviews. Additional documents provided by the agency to aid in\nshowing its compliance to the corrective action plan were samples of email\nreminders to staff related to treatment plan signature due dates and MISACWIS\ndocument upload day reminders; a licensing team meeting agenda for 7/18/2023,\nand sample calendar reminders by foster care supervisors/administration related to\nperformance evaluation due dates, social work contact training, quarterly and\nmanagement team meetings; and sample calendar reminders by licensing\nsupervisors to staff related to foster parent licensure renewal due dates, 45-day\nletters due dates; and foster parent orientation dates.\nThe agency’s efforts to complete this corrective action resulted in some progress in\na few areas, but the agency was not totally successful with all, as indicated by the\nrepeat violations indicated in this report. Additionally, as seen in this report the\nagency’s rule non-compliance in various areas increased from the previous year.\nThe second corrective action plan related to Special Investigation 2023C0000332.\nThe complaint was received on 3/17/2023 and it alleged the agency placed a foster\nyouth in a non-legal placement and incorrectly added the placement in the\nMISACWIS system as an unlicensed relative, which was inaccurate. During the\nspecial investigation the agency was found in violation of rule R400.12404(1) due to\nthe agency’s placement of the child into a fictive kin placement on 6/24/2022 when\nit did not receive approval from the court to do so until 8/10/2022. The agency has\nimplemented this corrective action plan by way of uploading the court order from\nthe court on that placement, creation of a spread sheet to track such\ncases/placements, and reminders to staff on kinship placement requirements. The\nagency had not had additional placements of this type at the time of review, so\nsample home studies and referrals to kinship staff by workers, and monitoring of\nneeds requires later assessment.",
    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nA chief administrator’s report was received dated 11/15/2023. Aside from my\nadvisement to the chief administrator to show the actual number of disrupted and\nunplanned removal within the report, there were no noted concerns for this\ndocument.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable. This is a Department of Health and Human Services child welfare\nfoster care program.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nAside from my discussion with the chief administrator, four section managers, and\ntwo licensing supervisors during the entrance conference, I interviewed one foster\ncare supervisor, one licensing worker and one foster care worker. The staff did not\nreport notable concerns or issues.\nYouth interviews were not applicable. The agency does not have youths in\nindependent living placements.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility did not reveal any noted concerns or safety issues.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe agency had three safety alerts during this licensing inspection period:\nConcern:\nThe first safety alert was received on 10/10/2023 related to an unlicensed relative’s\nhome not having an operable smoke detector on each level of occupancy and/or\nnear all sleeping areas. The unlicensed relative’s home did not have a smoke\ndetector in the basement.\nResolution:\nThe agency provided the unlicensed relative smoke alarms for the basement level of\nthe home on 10/11/2023. Photos showing the installation of all three devices were\nprovided.\nConcern:\nThe second safety alert was received on 10/10/2023 related to a foster home not\nhaving an operable smoke detector on each level of occupancy and/or near all\nsleeping areas. The foster home did not have a smoke detector on the main level of\nthe home.\nResolution:\nOn 10/11/2023, the licensing worker took a smoke detector to the foster home and\nensured that it was appropriately installed. A photo showing the installation of the\nsmoke detector was provided.",
    "Concern:\nThe third safety alert was received on 10/25/2023 related to a foster home not\nhaving an operable smoke detector on each level of occupancy. A smoke detector\nwas not observed in the basement of the home; and one of the smoke detectors on\nthe main level was beeping and needed to be replaced.\nResolution\nThe agency’s licensing worker went to the foster home with two new smoke\ndetectors on 10/26/2023. The worker replaced the smoke detector in the living room\nand installed a smoke detector in the basement. Photos were provided showing the\ninstallation of both devices.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nDecember 11, 2023\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 12, 2023\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager"
