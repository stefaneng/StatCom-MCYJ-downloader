    "ALLEGATION:\nThe facility is not entering restraints into MiSACWIS as required per emergency\nrules, despite emergency rules being in place for several months.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDirector 1 and Social Worker 6 were interviewed at the facility on June 8, 2021.\nSocial Worker 6 said her access to MiSACWIS was blocked because she had not\nsigned into MiSACWIS in a couple of months. She said that there had not been any\nreportable restraints before she tried to sign in.\nSocial Worker 6 sent me emails showing seven restraint were not properly recorded\nin MiSACWIS.\nCentral Office Staff 8 sent me an email on June 10, 2021, which said that\nMiSACWIS access is lost if the user does not log into MiSACWIS within a 60-day\nperiod, which is what occurred. Social Worker 8 applied to regain access but was\ndenied on May 26, 2021 because she did not put down a sufficient reason for\nneeding access.\nCentral Office Staff 9 sent the following email on June 10, 2021:\nIn looking at Social Worker 6’s MiSACWIS record she was auto terminated back\non 2/20/2021. It looks like her request from 5/26/2021 was denied because her\nrequest reason to gain her access back was not sufficient. It looks like she\nsubmitted a new request on 06/03/2021 that is pending with Application Security\nfor approval. There is one request for access through South Bluff and one for\nIndian River. Each “home” requires the user to have a profile set up under that\ncontract to do the Incident Report for the youth in that home.\nFor Director 1, he also submitted a new request on 5/17/2021 for access as he\nwas auto terminated.\nCentral Office Staff 9 sent another email on June 10, 2021, which read in part:\nSocial Worker 6 put her reason as “add back to MiSACWIS”. The denial from\nApplication security said “The request reason provided by the user is not\nsufficient. For audit purposes, the request reason should provide details\nexplaining how each of the requested user groups access will assist the user with\ncompleting their job duties.”\n…It appears that we have a hierarchy issue, as Social Worker 6 has listed\nDirector 1 as her supervisor, and Director 1 does not have access, and Dustin\nhas listed Director 8, who has not done any requests in DSA so even if",
    "everything was done perfectly by Social Worker 6 and Director 1, it would be held\nup because Director 8 has not done his part.\nI received an email on July 21, 2021, with Teaching Family Homes restraint policy which\ndid not mention MiSACWIS. I replied and received their Critical Incident Reporting for\nEmergency Rule Implementation which listed steps to report in MiSACWIS.\nI received a copy of an email dated September 13, 2021, which Social Worker 6 said\n“Attached are all incident reports from 7/25/21 until now that have been entered into\nMiSACWIS”\nI called Director 8 on September 29, 2021, who said Director 1 went on leave on\nSeptember 16, 2021 and did not return.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nRule 2 Prohibition of Prone Restraint; Procedures Involving Other\nRestraints in Child Caring Institutions\n(d) Procedures to submit the incident report regarding all\nrestraints within 12 hours to the parent or legal guardian in\nwriting and in writing to the Michigan Department of Health and\nHuman Services within 24 hours, as well as the review and\naggregation of incident reports regarding restraints at least\nbiannually by the CCI's director or designee.\nANALYSIS: The facility did not enter any physical restraints in MiSACWIS\nfor several months, evidenced by those responsible, Director 1\nand Staff 6, having not used MiSACWIS for at least 60 days,\nlosing access and not requesting access back timely or\nappropriately. While the emergency rules have expired\n7/16/2021, this requirement has been built into your contract;\ntherefore, requiring corrective action.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended this\ninvestigation be closed.\nSeptember 29, 2021\n________________________________________\nDon Collier Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager"
