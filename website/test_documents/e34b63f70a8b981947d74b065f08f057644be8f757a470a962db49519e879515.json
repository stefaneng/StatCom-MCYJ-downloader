The website is Cair Solutions, see below, and the\ninformation entered into “myadoptionportal” includes confidential information\nabout families and MDHHS children. A foster parent reported to MDHHS\nyesterday that he saw an article related to this website on Facebook, that he\nwas able to pull up a report that listed confidential information about FCS\nMacomb, and that by doing a Google search on a foster parent’s name was\nable to pull up the “myadoptionportal” PDF report that listed confidential\ninformation about families and kids.\nThe Wayne DHHS analyst was able to do the Google search herself and\nreceived the same report. She may be a person to contact for information if\n3",
    "needed. The concern is that both agencies appear to be using this website,\nand it is resulting in a violation of confidentiality of protected information.\nAgency director email dated 05/01/19 states the following:\nYesterday around 2:30ish we were notified that somehow one of our internal\nbilling reports was able to be located by an outside party via Google.\nCurrently, we utilize an internal database system - Cairs Solutions (My\nAdoption Portal - MAPS) to log all of our internal information including our\nfoster parent information, the children’s information, billing, stipends, clothing\nallowances, mileage, etc. Our foster parents do not have access to this. We\nalso use this with our international/domestic families whom do have access to\nthis portal to upload their documents for their home studies, etc. including\nmarriage certificates, birth certificates, etc. Within one hour of being notified of\nthis issue we contacted MAPS and they restricted access within 3 minutes.\nThis program is a secured program that is protected by multiple firewalls, an\nindividual cannot get into their internal network to the production data without\ngoing through multiple layers/firewalls. For example, in order for us or our\nadoptive parents to get into the program a username/password is required.\nWhat happened in this situation is that one of our billing reports was being\nused in their “testing environment” and somehow the security feature for this\nmalfunctioned, allowing public access. Per the CEO at MAPS, in order for\nsomeone to have gained access to this they would’ve had to type in the name\nof the family + the name of the testing environment, which is not public\nknowledge. We don’t even know that information so I’m not sure how an\noutside person would know that. Also, according to MAPS only four people\ngained access to this (as they can and did track the IP addresses) – one was\nthe State of Michigan, one was the person who initially accessed the\ninformation, one was us (FCS) and one was another party whom clicked the\nlink whom I’m assuming may be the person who forwarded the information to\nyou. I asked MAPS how long they believe this was accessible to the public\nand they are under the belief that it was a short period of time as from what\nthey can see Google indexed this very recently.\nAll this being said, I asked them what would be done to ensure something like\nthis does not occur again. They have indicated that they will no longer be\nputting billing reports into testing environments and would be placing them\ninto a “privileged only” category where only certain people are granted\naccess. According to MAPS, this did not affect other agencies or other billing\nreports, just this one. This billing report included the foster parents\nname/address, child’s name, SACWIS person ID#, DOC level and placement\ndates.\nDirector emailed to request a copy of the entire list of families observed on the\nwebsite on 05/02/19 and reported the following update:\n4",
    "I only have the screenshot that consultant 2 sent me and the link is now\nrestricted. I did request it from the computer data program but because it was\na “testing environment” as soon as they restricted the access they also lost\nthe information in the testing environment (I guess, I’m not super-computer\nsavvy) since it was not a full report and only a sample.\nAlso, I did call the compliance office however, they told me that because we\nare not DHHS they do not deal with us. I explained that we are a PAFC that\nwas contracted through DHHS but they said that doesn’t matter. Anyhow, that\ndoesn’t really seem right to me so I’m going to send in the DCH 1422 form as\noutlined in the policy: APL 68E-130 BREACH, SECURITY INCIDENT OR\nIMPERMISSIBLE USE OR DISCLOSURE, to the Privacy Security e-mail and\ngo from there. From how I’m reading this policy, once I send this document in\nthey determine the level of risk of harm under the HIPAA Act which\ndetermines if we have to notify the individuals of the breach. While a DOC in\nand of itself doesn’t verify any health breach (could be educational) in my\nopinion a SED is directly a result of mental health issues so that would fall\nunder the HIPAA Guideline. I will send this document in when completed (I\nhave attached for your viewing) – hopefully by tomorrow as the one question I\nneed to answer is how many people were affected but I can’t do that\naccurately without the full report.\nIf I don’t get a response from the compliance office in a reasonable period of\ntime as we are not DHHS I will follow the HIPAA Guideline and notify the\neffected parties.\nThe Wayne DHHS analyst confirmed via email, on 05/02/19, that she was initially\nable to click the link when this information came up. She tracked a couple of families\nback to the agency. When asked for some clarifying information, the analyst was not\nable to connect via the link any longer.\nDirector emailed the following update on 05/20/19:\nAs outlined in DHHS policy APL-68E-130 I called DHHS Privacy Security on\n5-2-19 to notify them of the breach, the woman on the phone told me that\nbecause we were not DHHS (even though were a contracted PAFC) they did\nnot care and wouldn’t look into this issue. I didn’t think that was accurate so I\nalso followed up with an e-mail on 5-3-19. On 5-15-19 I received an e-mail\nback from the Privacy and Compliance Analyst indicating “We have reviewed\nthe incident but have not completed an assessment yet.” I did ask if there was\na time frame for receiving an assessment and this was the response “Every\nincident is different – it depends on the severity, data, risk, and other\nincidents. HIPAA incidents must be resolved within 60 days, but they don’t\nusually get that far.”\n5",
    "That being said, we are just waiting for their risk assessment and how they\nare requesting we move forward.\nDirector emailed on 06/05/19 that they still had not received an update from DHHS\nPrivacy Security.\nDirector emailed on 09/09/19 that they had never received a risk assessment from\nprivacy security but did send a letter to the individual this affected (per HIPAA\nGuidelines) within the appropriate timeframe.\nDirector provided the following updates on 09/27/2019:\nDirector reported that Cair Solutions is a “computer database system in which\nwe enter in our families, dates of placement, per diems, etc. in order to be\nable to generate our internal billing reports, monitor our internal finances, etc.\nIn addition, families within our international and domestic adoption programs\ncan make their own login and upload their documents needed for their\nadoption home study (i.e. marriage license, driver’s license, etc.) for us to\nhave access too. This is all password protected.” The Director verified that\nCair Solutions did not, and does not, have access to MiSACWIS. In regard to\nnotifications to those affected by the breach, the director noted that they sent\na letter to the individual whose medical information was breeched (SED\nWaiver child) via the HIPAA protocol. Per HIPAA we had to notify anyone\nwhom has health information breeched within 60 days. The 60th day in this\ncase was on 7-1-19 and we sent the letter on that date as we hadn’t heard\nback from the DHHS Security Breech department with regards to any\ndirection. We did not send letters regarding the other individuals with DOC’s\nas a DOC in and of itself does not necessarily pertain to physical or mental\nhealth, it can be geared toward education or behavior.\nFollow up communication with director dated 10/07/19 states the following update\nwas provided in regard to feedback from MDHHS Privacy and Security:\nWe sent the initial e-mail on 05/03/2019 and did not receive a response. I\nsent a follow up on 05/15/2019 and the Privacy and Compliance Analyst\nresponded that they have not completed an assessment yet. I asked if there\nwas a time frame for this and he said typically 60-days, but it usually doesn’t\nget to that. We never heard anything else, so I followed up again on\n06/07/2019 because the 60th day was approaching (07/01/2019) and I was\ngoing on maternity leave and wanted to have this wrapped up. We did not\nget a response to that e-mail and hadn’t heard anything by the 60th day so\nwe sent out the letter to our foster parent per HIPAA guidelines on the 60th\nday.\n6",
    "Privacy and Security analyst emailed the following on 10/15/2019 stating:\nWe completed the incident below as low risk, with no notice required to the\nindividuals. HIPAA is not applicable to the data and the incident did not meet\nthe breach criteria of the Michigan Identity Theft Protection Act – the two\nregulations with notice requirements. Even if they had been applicable, the\nincident still appears to be low risk per the situation.\nA copy of the document alleged to have been subject to this breach was provided by\nthe agency and was found to be labeled, “Foster Care Billing Report.” It was dated\n04/03/2017 with a time of 10:31:24AM. The information contained on this report was\n“Family,” “Family Address,” “Child,” “Age Group,” “DOC Level,” “Case No.,” “No of\nDays,” “Placement Date,” and “End Date.” There were 5 families identified and 8\nchildren.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12211 Privacy safeguard.\n(1) An agency shall safeguard the privacy of a child and his or\nher family.\nANALYSIS: There is clear evidence in this case to demonstrate\nnoncompliance as foster parent information and children’s\nnames were briefly available to unauthorized users. Although\nthe third-party provider is contracted by the agency, it is the\nagency who is ultimately responsible for compliance with\nlicensing rules.\nCONSULTATION: The agency should consider discussing the use of third-party\ncontractors with their assigned MDHHS contract analyst to\nreview and for potential contractual concerns.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
