    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code COF Rule 400.10107 Employment policies and procedures;\nTitle & establishment\nSection (1) A facility shall establish and follow written employment policies\nDescription and procedures that shall assure that staff are emotionally stable\nand of suitable health, ability, experience, and education to\nperform the duties assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 1/16/25, a staff member allowed two youth to enter a storage\nunit and fight. Both youths sustained hand injuries.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 1/27/25 in coordination with MDHHS Worker. CA\nreported Staff 1 began working at the facility in November 2024,\nand just completed her training two weeks ago. CA reported the\nweek of 1/12/25 was Staff 1’s first week of working as a fully\nactive staff. CA reported Youth B went to the clinic to be seen for\nan unrelated situation, and, while at the clinic, Youth B reported\nhis hand hurt because of a fight with Youth A. Youth B reported\nthe fight occurred in a supply closet, so Supervisor was notified.\nCA reported Supervisor asked Youth B some questions, and then\nSupervisor involved CA as well. CA reported Youth B stated Staff\n1 allowed him and Youth A into a supply closet to fight for a “30”.\nCA reported a “30” means a fight for 30 seconds. CA reported he\nchecked the video on the pod and verified the fight occurred and\nStaff 1 was present. CA reported Staff 1 was suspended pending\ninvestigation, and she is supposed to be terminated this afternoon.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/27/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported he and\nYouth B took advantage of Staff 1 (because she was a new staff)\nso they could fight. Youth A reported he approached Staff 1 and\nasked her if he and Youth B could “blow off some steam” by\n“having a 30 with body shots”. Youth A reported Staff 1 agreed to\nlet them do it. Youth A reported it didn’t take any effort to convince\nStaff 1 to let them fight, and she didn’t ask any questions or object\nto their request. Youth A reported he was surprised Staff 1 agreed\nso easily. Youth A reported Staff 1 allowed him and Youth B into\nthe supply closet, and Staff 1 kept the supply closet door cracked\nwhile she stood outside of the door. Youth A reported he and\nYouth B punched each other, and they each punched the wall too.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 did not say anything during the fight and\n2",
    "did not try to intervene. Youth A reported they stopped fighting\nbecause Youth B ended up hurting his hand after punching the\nwall. Youth A reported he was not sure if Staff 1 was watching the\nfight, but he thought Staff 1 could hear or see what was happening\nbecause she left the door cracked and stood outside. Youth A\nreported he is not aware of Staff 1 or any other staff allowing fights\nlike this to occur previously.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/27/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported he and\nYouth A were in the dayroom one day, and he was sick of Youth A\ntalking down to him. Youth B reported he and Youth A asked Staff\n1 if they could go into the storage room and “blow off some\nsteam”. Youth B reported they did not specify they were going to\nfight or what “blow off some steam” meant. Youth B reported Staff\n1 replied, “are y’all sure that’s what you want to do?”. Youth B\nreported he and Youth A both said yes, so she agreed to it. Youth\nB reported she opened the storage room to let them in, and then\nshe stood right outside the door with the door cracked. Youth B\nreported he and Youth A punched each other in the storage room,\nand it lasted about 30-60 seconds. Youth B reported they stopped\nfighting because Staff 1 opened the door and said, “alright,\nalright”. Youth B reported Staff 1 did not try to intervene or stop\nthem from fighting prior to that. Youth B reported he hit his hand\non the wall in the storage room, and his hand was swollen for\nabout a week, so he went to the clinic to have it looked at. Youth B\nreported after the clinic, Supervisor approached him and asked\nhim about the situation. Youth B reported after he spoke with\nSupervisor, CA also got involved and spoke with him about the\nsituation. Youth B reported he isn’t aware of any staff, including\nStaff 1, allowing fighting like this to occur prior to this incident.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via video conference on 2/7/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported Youth B\napproached her and asked if he and Youth A could “let off some\nsteam”. Staff 1 reported they didn’t tell her what they were going\nto do, and she didn’t ask. Staff 1 reported Youth A told her a male\nstaff lets the youth into the storage room to blow off steam all the\ntime. Staff 1 reported Youth A did not tell her who the male staff\nwas, and she doesn’t know if Youth A was being truthful or if he\nwas saying it to manipulate the situation because she was a\nbrand-new staff. Staff 1 reported she asked Youth A why they had\nto go into the storage room, and Youth A told her it was because\nof space. Staff 1 reported she opened the storage room and let\nYouth A and Youth B in, but didn’t know what they were going to\ndo in the room. Staff 1 reported Youth A and Youth B had no\n3",
    "animosity towards each other that she had witnessed, so she\nwould never have imagined they were going to fight. Staff 1\nreported as soon as she saw they were fighting; she told them to\nstop. Staff 1 reported they didn’t stop right away but did after a\ncouple more punches. Staff 1 reported she didn’t willingly allow\nthem to fight, but she admits it was against her best judgement to\nallow them into the storage room and not ask more questions.\nStaff 1 reported she didn’t write an incident report or notify anyone\nof the incident afterwards because she was in shock. Staff 1\nreported she thought the situation would just blow over. Staff 1\nreported she realizes now she should have given Youth A and\nYouth B a consequence, and document the incident occurred\nbecause it likely would have avoided this investigation. Staff 1\nreported she knows she didn’t follow procedure, and she takes\nresponsibility for her actions.\nSupervisor was interviewed via phone on 2/5/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor reported he was\nnotified of the situation after Youth B was seen in the clinic for an\nunrelated situation. Supervisor reported he spoke to Youth B and\nasked him about the fight he was in. Youth B told Supervisor, Staff\n1 allowed him and Youth A to “run a 30” in the closet. Supervisor\nreported the fight occurred on 1/16/25, but he didn’t find out about\nit until Youth A was seen in the clinic, which was about a week\nlater. Supervisor reported he did not speak with Youth A about the\nsituation. Supervisor reported he told CA about the situation right\naway, and they both watched the video. Supervisor reported Staff\n1 was a brand-new staff, and he didn’t have any concerns about\nStaff 1 prior to this incident.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 1/16/25 was reviewed. Although there’s audio,\nit’s difficult to hear what the individuals on the video are saying\ndue to the echo in the pod. Youth A, Youth B and Staff 1 are seen\nin the milieu area of the pod. Youth A and Youth B are standing by\none table while Staff 1 is sitting at another table. Youth A and\nYouth B walk over to the storage room. Staff 1 stood up, followed\nthem to the storage room, and opened the door for them to enter.\nYouth A and Youth B entered the storage room. Staff 1 was\nlooking into the room, began shutting the door, and left it cracked\nwhile she stood outside the door. While she is shutting the door,\none of the youth ran towards the other youth (hidden by the door)\nwith his fists up. While Staff 1 is outside the door, she looked into\nthe room through the cracked door the entire time Youth A and\nYouth B are in the room. Through the crack, movement can be\nseen by the youth inside the room, and the squeaking of shoes on\n4",
    "the floor of the storage room can be heard. After about 30\nseconds, Youth A and Youth B exit the room laughing. Staff 1\nshuts the door and followed them back into the milieu area of the\npod. Youth A and Youth B shook hands while talking and\nlaughing.\nTOUR OBSERVATION:\nA tour of the facility occurred on 1/27/25. Viewed the storage room\nwhere Youth A and Youth B fought and took pictures of the\nstorage room.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Agency Response Strategy dated 1/24/25 authored by\nPrimary Consultant states she spoke with CA, and he noted\nStaff 1 was put on administrative leave as of 1/24/25\npending investigation.\n• Email from CA dated 1/28/25 states Staff 1 did not show for\ntheir scheduled termination meeting on 1/28/25, and\ninstead sent a letter of resignation effective immediately.\n• Medical report for Youth B dated 1/17/25 notes Youth B\nwas seen due to right hand soreness after punching a wall\non 1/16/25.
