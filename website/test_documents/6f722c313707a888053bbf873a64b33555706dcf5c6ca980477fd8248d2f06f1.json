    "Youth A\nOn 4/10/24 Youth A was interviewed by Consultant 1 and I. Youth\nA was no longer at Holy Cross Queen of Angels. Consultant 1 was\nat the Midland County Juvenile Center, and I was on the phone.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 physically assaulted him.\nYouth A reported they would “punch, push, and grab” him. Youth\nA was unable to provide details on when this occurred. Youth A\nreported it happened in the hallways. Youth A reported Staff 2\nbent his fingers back once. Youth A reported he had “something”\nin his hand but couldn’t recall what it was. Youth A reported this\nwas why Staff 2 bent his fingers back. Youth A was unable to\nprovide any details on any of the allegations. Youth A reported\nNurse 1 never physically hit him.\nNurse 1\nI interviewed Nurse 1 face to face at the facility on 4/10/24. Nurse\n1 reported she has never physically assaulted Youth A. Nurse 1\nreported she has been attacked by Youth A with a piece of glass\nand witnessed staff place him in a standing hold to stop his violent\nbehavior. Nurse 1 reported the staff (unknown) in that situation\ncompleted the standing hold appropriately. Nurse 1 reported she\nhas never been involved in an incident with Staff 1 or Staff 2.\nNurse 1 reported she has seen Youth A attack staff and staff allow\nhim to punch them, while they are attempting to verbally\ndeescalate Youth A. Nurse 1 reported she has also seen Youth A\npick up glass and staff remove that glass from his hands. Nurse 1\nreported this happened a few times. Nurse 1 reported the times\nthat she had seen this, the staff (unknown) did it appropriately.\nStaff 1\nI interviewed Staff 1 face to face at the facility on 4/10/24. Staff 1\nreported he was involved with a situation with Youth A when\nYouth A attempted to break into the company van in the parking\nlot. Staff 1 reported he kept standing in between the van and\nYouth A. Staff 1 reported he never had to restrain Youth A and did\nnot physically assault him. Staff 1 reported during another time,\nYouth A was attempting to grab the fire extinguisher from the wall\nand Staff 1 pulled his arms back from grabbing it. Staff 1 reported\nthere was another incident when Youth A was attempting to break\nthe window in an office and Staff 1 redirected him. Youth A did not\nlisten and pushed the glass, and it broke. Staff 1 reported he\ngrabbed Youth A’s hands at that time, because the glass pieces\nwere in Youth A’s hands and Youth A was attempting to close his\nhands around the glass. Staff 1 reported they took him to the\nhospital on that occasion. Staff 1 reported all staff were “well-\nversed” in how to interact with Youth A. Staff 1 reported he never\n4",
    "physically assaulted Youth A and never seen any staff become\naggressive with Youth A or assault Youth A.\nStaff 2\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 5/13/24 via telephone. Staff 2 reported she\nwas involved in one incident where she had to restrain Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A had completed a court hearing and was\ngetting ready to go to school when he took off running and went\noutside. Youth A found a pipe near the maintenance shed and\nwent around the building and broke five windows and two doorway\nwindows. Staff 2 reported he climbed through the doorway window\nand locked the door. Staff 2 was able to get through the door and\nYouth A had a large piece of glass in his hand. Staff 2 reported\nshe had restrained him and held him down until police came, this\nrestraint was appropriately conducted. Staff 2 reported she has\nnever seen any staff physically assault Youth A and staff keep him\nsafe. Staff 2 reported she has never physically assaulted Youth A.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI requested and reviewed any incident reports that had Nurse 1,\nStaff 1 or Staff 2 involved with deescalating Youth A.\n• Incident report dated 3/20/24 included Staff 2. Staff’ 2s\ninterview is consistent with the incident report.\n• Incident report dated 2/21/24 included Staff 1. Staff 1’s\ninterview is consistent with the incident report.\n• Incident report dated 3/22/24 included Nurse 1. Nurse 1’s\ninterview is consistent with the incident report. Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 were not involved in this incident.\n• I reviewed their behavior management policy which\nprohibits physical punishment as a form of intervention.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Youth A was unable to\nprovide details to being physically assaulted by staff other than\nreporting Staff 1 grabbed him and bent his fingers back and Staff\n2 punched and pushed him. These incidents, if in fact the\nincidents reported on documentation above, reveal Youth A\ncreating a dangerous situation for himself and others around him.\nStaff acted appropriately in each situation.\n• Due to the unsafe behaviors of Youth A, Staff 1 did have to\nhold his hands to stop him from hurting himself.\n5",
    "• Staff 2 did have to restrain Youth A which would result in\nStaff 2 “grabbing” him. Based on interviews and incident\nreports, the allegations are unfounded.\n• Nurse 1 witnessed staff conducting a standing hold\nappropriately. She also witnessed staff removing glass from\nYouth A’s hand and staff allowing Youth A to punch them\nwithout staff retaliating.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n5/14/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
