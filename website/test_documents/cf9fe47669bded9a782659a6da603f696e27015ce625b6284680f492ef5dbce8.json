    "the unit, and at that time Staff 2 believed Youth A was attempting\nto walk off the unit without permission. He did not recall Youth A\nsaying anything. Staff 2 stated Staff 1 then came to the same\ndoorway and pushed Youth A, causing Youth A to fall to the\nground. He specified Staff 1 pushed Youth A with one hand into\nYouth A’s chest. Staff 2 commented that this physical contact felt\nexcessive compared to the behavior presented by Youth A. Staff\n2 had never seen Staff 1 behave this way or react to a youth’s\nbehavior this way.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed over the phone on\n04/18/2024. She confirmed Staff 1 was still on administrative\nleave and she had not spoken with Staff 1 specifically about the\nincident or since the time that he was put on leave because of the\npending investigations.\nDuring a video conference call on 04/05/2024 DHHS Worker 1\nstated her investigation would not produce any findings.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 04/22/2024. He was\nable to recall the incident in question. Staff 1 stated he was\nwalking out of the unit when he moved through the doorway, and\nwhen he turned around to close the door behind him, he realized\nthat Youth A was behind him and attempting to come out of the\nunit as well. Youth A was not moving quickly and did not say\nanything at that time. Staff 1 stated Youth A had his hand on the\ndoor as Staff 1 attempted to close it. In response, Staff 1 stopped\nclosing the door and put his hand out to Youth A and made\ncontact with Youth A’s shoulder. Staff 1 stated this resulted in a\npush and caused Youth A to fall to the ground. Staff 1 clarified\nthat he did not know that Youth A had fallen to the ground until he\nreturned to the unit 15 or 20 minutes later. Staff 1 stated his intent\nwas not to push Youth A but to remove him from the doorway and\nprevent him from exiting the unit and having the door closed on\nhim. Staff 1 stated Youth A did not say anything during this\ninteraction, and Staff 1 did not say anything to Youth A either\nbecause he then turned around and walked away.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• The personnel file for Staff 1 was reviewed. He had no\nformal discipline noted but did have several examples of\ndocumented coaching regarding agency values,\nconsistency with staff and youth, paperwork, spatial\nawareness and line of sight efforts, proper locking of doors\nand personal cell phone use.\n3",
    "• An incident report dated 03/05/2024 was provided and\nreviewed. This was authored by Supervisor 1, although he\nwasn’t a witness to the event. This documentation noted\nStaff 2 witnessed Youth A being pushed by Staff 1 as a\nresponse to Youth A attempting to walk off the unit. The\nsame documentation contained narrative from Staff 1\nstating Youth A had attempted to push past him to get to\nthe main hallway, and Staff 1 prevented this by protecting\nhis physical boundaries.\n• Video footage was provided and viewed:\no One camera angle was located directly above the\ndoorway within the unit, and the end of the\nhallway. Staff 1 was first seen standing near the\ndoorway and then exiting out of the unit. Youth A\nwalked toward the same doorway and arrived at it\nabout 15 seconds later. Staff 2 can be seen walking\nbehind Youth A. He then opened the door and\nattempted to pass through the doorway. Youth A\nthen fell backward to the ground directly in front of\nStaff 2. Staff 1 could not be seen at that point in\ntime.\no Two other camera angles of the incident were\nviewed during the 03/13/2024 on-site visit. One\ncamera angle was in the space outside of the\nunit. No parts of the incident itself could be viewed\nbecause of a small alcove area located directly\noutside of the unit doorway. A second camera angle\nwas viewed inside of the unit at the opposite end of\nthe hallway from the door where the incident\noccurred. Because of the distance and other youth\nand staff that were in the hallway more near this\ncamera angle there was no view of the incident\nitself.\n• Facility policy titled “Residential AWOL Protocol” was\nprovided and reviewed. This policy provided proper\ninstruction on staff’s responsibilities as a result of an AWOL\nyouth. It did not provide instruction on how to attempt to\nprevent an AWOL, including physical contact.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was evidence found that Staff 1 pushed Youth A\nduring the incident in question.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2024C0001164SI dated 04/04/24, CAP pending.\n4",
