Pre-exit with Program\nManager/Chief Administrator, with email follow-up.\nALLEGATION:\nEmployee at agency sent a nude picture of themself to a foster youth. There are\nadditional concerns that youth has stayed with this employee at a motel.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 4/29/22 it was reported to DCWL that Staff 1, a Michigan Youth Opportunities\nInitiative (MYOI) case worker sent nude photos to Youth A. Youth A is a person with\na cognitive impairment. It was reported Youth A may have stayed with Staff 1 in a\nhotel. However, further details are unknown.\nComplainant\nOn 4/29/22 the complainant was interviewed by phone. The complainant reported\nthe photos on Youth A’s phone were found by his mother. The complainant reported\nobserving the photos as provided by Youth A’s mother. They were fully nude photos\nof Staff 1. Staff 1’s face could be seen in the photos. It was believed Staff 1 was\nYouth A’s MYOI worker. DHHS and Law Enforcement (LE) were contacted and\nprovided with this information. Complainant reported Youth A’s mother informed her\nthere was something with Youth A and Staff 1 at a hotel but did not have any further\ninformation.\n3",
    "Chief Administrator\nOn 4/29/22 the Chief Administrator (CA) was contacted via Teams video call. The\nCA reported being aware of the allegation and the involvement of LE. CA was\ninformed that while LE would be investigating any criminal actions, DCWL needed to\ninvestigate to determine if the staff member acted in manner that was inconsistent\nwith licensing rules and her role as an agency staff. CA reported Staff 1 was placed\non administrative leave. However, they had not been able to reach her by phone or\nemail.\nLaw Enforcement\nOn 4/29/22, 5/4/22, 5/10/22, 5/18/22, and 5/24/22 LE was contacted by phone;\nmessages were left for the officer. On 6/7/22 LE was contacted via email. A\nresponse was received on 6/9/22, in which LE reported the investigation was\nongoing. LE further reported interviews were completed with Youth A and his\nmother. LE stated Staff 1 was refusing to comply with an interview. On 6/17/22,\nadditional information was requested from LE. On 6/28/22 LE reported the\ninvestigation would be completed and referred to the prosecutor’s office within the\nnext few weeks.\nFoster Care Supervisor\nOn 5/4/22 an interview was completed at the agency with Foster Care Supervisor\n(Supervisor). Supervisor reported Staff 1 was an MYOI coordinator at the agency.\nShe explained Staff 1’s role was to reach out to youth in foster care and notify them\nof programs and training opportunities that are available through MYOI. It was\nbelieved Staff 1 met Youth A through one of these programs. However, Youth A’s\nfoster care case was managed by another agency.\nSupervisor verified Staff 1 was the person in the photos. Supervisor also provided\ndocumentation that Youth A attended MYOI meetings with Staff 1 on the following\ndates:\n Virtual meetings in a group setting: 10/5/2021, 10/11/2021, 10/14/2021,\n11/16/2021, 11/17/2021, 11/30/2021, 12/2/2021, 12/7/2021, 12/9/2021,\n12/21/2021, 1/5/2022 and 1/10/2022.\n Face to face contact between Staff 1 and Youth A: 12/1/2021 and 12/8/2021\nSupervisor verified Staff 1 was placed on leave. After initially being unable to contact\nher on 4/29/22, Staff 1 arrived at the agency to turn in her computer and phone. The\nagency also blocked her access to the MYOI Facebook page. During this interaction,\nStaff 1 reported Youth A’s family was trying to extort her for money. Staff 1 reported\nthere were messages on the MYOI Facebook about it, but the messages were no\nlonger there. Supervisor reported prior to this, there were no concerns regarding\nStaff 1. Staff 1 was always professional and organized. Staff 1 did not have any\ndisciplinary action and never mentioned Youth A.\n4",
    "Program Manager\nOn 5/4/22 an interview was completed at the agency with Program Manager.\nProgram Manager reported being aware of the allegation and attempting to have\ncontact with LE. However, they had not been responsive. Program Manager stated\nprior to the allegation, she did not have any concerns about Staff 1 and there was no\ndisciplinary action on file. Program Manager reported she initially became aware of\nthis situation as Youth A’s mother was in the DHHS lobby showing the photos and\ntelling everyone in the lobby about it. Program Manager and Supervisor were not in\nthe building at the time, but they were informed by other staff. The photos were later\nsent to Supervisor’s phone, where Program Manager viewed them. Program\nManager reported the nude photos were of Staff 1. Staff 1’s face was visible in a few\nof them. Program Manager also stated the tattoos on the person in the photos\nmatched those of Staff 1 as posted on her social media. Labor relations and LE were\ncontacted. Staff 1 came to the building around 5:00pm and turned in her computer\nand phone. Program Manager then changed the MYOI Facebook account to prevent\nStaff 1 from further accessing any messages. Program Manager reported checking\nthe account and found all private messages had been deleted. As Youth A’s foster\ncare case is managed by another office, that office was contacted and informed of\nthe situation. A welfare check was completed with Youth A by his assigned foster\ncare worker on 4/29/22. A safety plan was reportedly implemented by the worker, in\nwhich Youth A agreed not to have any contact with Staff 1.\nOn 5/5/22 Program Manager contacted DCWL by phone and provided contact\ninformation for LE as a new officer had been assigned. On 5/13/22 Program\nManager contacted DCWL by email and reported that she was no longer attempting\nto contact LE as Labor Relations had concluded their investigation. Effective\n5/11/22, Staff 1 was no longer employed with the agency.\nFoster Care Worker\nOn 5/23/22 phone contact occurred with Youth A’s foster care worker (Worker).\nWorker stated she never had contact with Staff 1 as they are with different agencies.\nWorker reported never hearing Youth A mention Staff 1, or any photos, or any other\nindication of an inappropriate relationship. However, Youth A’s mother sent the nude\nphotos of Staff 1 to Worker when the allegation was made. Worker reported seeing\nYouth A on 4/29/22 for a ‘welfare check’ to make sure he was ok after the\nallegations were reported. Worker stated Youth A made a safety plan with his\nattorney, not to have any contact with Staff 1. The safety plan also indicated Youth A\nwould not be alone with any staff at any time. When Worker completed her face-to-\nface contact with Youth A on 4/29/22, she had another staff accompany her. Worker\ndid not have a copy of the attorney’s safety plan.\nYouth A’s mother\nA phone number listed in MiSACWIS was attempted for Youth A’s mother. However,\nthe number was out of service. Several attempts were made to obtain contact\ninformation from professionals involved in the family’s case previously. Two\nadditional phone numbers were obtained. However, attempts to both numbers on\n5",
    "6/28/22, went unanswered. On 6/29/22 Youth A’s mother called and completed a\nphone interview. She reported Youth A came to her with concern about Staff 1\ncontacting him frequently and sending him pictures. Youth A indicated he was\nannoyed by the constant attention from Staff 1. Youth A provided the nude photos to\nhis mother. His mother then went to DHHS to speak with Supervisor. However, the\nSupervisor was not there. Youth A’s mother then sent the photos to the Supervisor\nvia text. Youth A’s mother indicated she only knew about the photos from Youth A\nand did not have any direct knowledge about a hotel room. Youth A’s mother also\nreported that regarding this allegation, a new detective has been assigned, and LE\nstated their investigation was ongoing, due to additional victims coming forward.\nYouth A’s mother discussed some prior incidents of alleged abuse while Youth A\nwas previously in a foster home in 2016 or 2017 and a residential facility in 2019. A\nreview of MISACWIS found the allegations regarding the residential facility were\ninvestigated by DCWL and DHHS in 2019 (SIR 2020C0214007). A review of Youth\nA’s placements in 2016/2017 did not find any special evaluations or allegations of\nthe described sexual abuse toward Youth A in a foster home. Although a review of\nChildren’s Services history found a DHHS investigation from 2016 that matched the\nallegation. This abuse allegedly occurred in 2015/2016 while Youth A was living in\nhis adoptive home. DHHS completed an investigation, which resulted in Youth A\nbeing removed from the adoptive home and placed in foster care. As both\nallegations have been previously investigated, no further action is required at this\ntime.\nYouth A\nA phone call was attempted on 6/21/22. The person that answered, reported it was\nthe wrong number. During a call with Youth A’s mother on 6/29/22, Youth A was on\nthe line briefly, but declined an interview. An email was sent to Youth A on 7/6/22\nrequesting an in person or phone interview. On 7/7/22 Youth A responded and\ndeclined an interview, referring DCWL to his attorney.\nLaw Enforcement\nOn 6/29/22 emails were exchanged with the assigned officer. LE reported Youth A’s\nmother was incorrect, there have been no additional victims identified and no\nchange in the assigned officer.\nStaff 1\nA phone call was attempted on 6/24/22, a message was left. A follow-up text was\nsent to Staff 1’s personal phone number, requesting that she call or text back, even\nif she did not wish to be interviewed. No response was received.\nDocuments reviewed\n The photos sent to the agency by Youth A’s mother, were reviewed while on-\nsite on 5/4/22. The photos of Staff 1 were nude and showing her face in some\npictures. In addition, there was a private message from the MYOI Facebook\naccount in which Staff 1 asked Youth A why he had not been contacting her.\n6",
    "Youth A stated he was busy. Staff 1 replied that it seemed like he stopped\nmessaging her after she showed him what she did. There was no clarification\nabout what she was referring to.\n Staff 1’s personal social media profile was reviewed and confirmed the photos\nsent to Youth A, were of Staff 1. Confirmation occurred by matching Staff 1’s\nface and multiple body tattoos.\n A review of Staff 1’s HR file was completed. Staff 1 was hired on 2/2/2009,\nnew hire and annual training was completed as required, and there was no\ndisciplinary action on file.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: A violation was found as it was determined that Staff 1 provided\nnude photos of herself to Youth A.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend no change in the\nlicense status. The investigation will be re-opened by DCWL if law enforcement\ndetermines any information indicating any additional licensing violation.\n_ _______________July 8, 2022__________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 8, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
