The source\nreported that it appeared the agency should have cited the foster parent for non-\ncompliance in both incidents. However, the agency found the home in full\ncompliance.\n2",
    "Chief Administrator\nOn 1/27/22 a phone call occurred with the Chief Administrator (CA), in which they\nwere notified of the allegation and investigation. The CA provided contact\ninformation for the licensing workers that completed the reports, as well as the\nlicensing supervisor that approved the reports. On 1/31/22 a follow-up email was\nsent to confirm the on-site visit for 2/1/22. The CA noted that one staff was on\nvacation and the other on maternity leave. It was determined with the DCWL Area\nManager that interviews would be conducted remotely via Teams.\nDocument Review\nSER #1 summary: Authored by Worker 1\nIt was alleged on 9/3/21 the foster child (Youth A) and foster mother (FP1) got into\nan argument while in a parked car. FP1 grabbed Youth A by the arm. No injuries\nwere noted. Youth A then exited the car and walked to the other side of the car and\nopened the door to retrieve her daughter. FP1 was in the driver’s seat and pulled the\ncar forward while Youth A was leaning into the car. Youth A was half-in and half-out\nof the car as it moved. During interviews, FP1 reported pulling the car forward as an\nattempt to shut the door and keep Youth A from entering the vehicle. The foster\nfather (FP2) reported not being present at the time of the incident. He arrived shortly\nafter and indicated they were not willing to let Youth A into the car because of her\nbehavior of yelling at another youth in the car. Law enforcement and DHHS\nresponded. No arrests were made. Youth A moved from the home to another\nplacement. DHHS determined no findings in the incident. However, DHHS noted\nconcern as it appeared FP1 did not have concern for Youth A or the youth’s child in\nthe moment. The agency concluded insufficient information to establish a violation.\nLicensing Supervisor\nOn 2/3/22 an interview was conducted with the Supervisor via Teams. Regarding\nSER 1, the Supervisor remembered discussing the investigation with Licensing\nWorker 1 and reading the report. Supervisor recalled that Youth A was in an\nargument with another child in the car. Youth A then tried to remove her child from\nthe car. The foster parents then called law enforcement (LE) and DHHS. It was her\nunderstanding that DHHS and LE were mainly concerned the foster parents\nintended to leave Youth A behind. Both entities determined the foster parent locked\nYouth A out of the car as a means to protect the other children and did not intend to\nleave Youth A behind. The agency moved Youth A to another placement after this\nincident. DHHS chose not to open a case regarding the incident.\nWhen asked how the agency came to their determination in SER 1, Supervisor\nstated they felt FP1’s actions were due to her concern for the safety of the children\nin the car. Supervisor indicated there had previously been concern about how Youth\nA behaved with her child in the past. It was noted that Youth A’s child is not a state\nward. The foster parent was worried Youth A may take her child and leave or put her\nin danger, which would then put the foster parents at risk of failure to protect. When\nasked why the agency did not determine a violation for FP1 moving the car with\nYouth A partially in the door, the Supervisor indicated that DHHS did not open a\n3",
    "case and therefore the agency felt their recommendation was in line with what\nDHHS found. The Supervisor stated the agency felt the investigation was\ninconclusive regarding the foster parent grabbing Youth A and therefore did not\nbelieve a violation could be found.\nWorker 1\nAn interview was completed on 2/3/22 via Teams. Regarding SER 1 Worker 1 stated\nthe investigation was mostly focused on the physical harm aspect of FP1 grabbing\nYouth A’s arm. As the investigation was inconclusive about if this occurred, a rule\nviolation was not found. Worker 1 stated that she did not focus on the piece about\nFP1 and Youth A with the car, as determining if abuse occurred with the arm grab\nseemed most urgent. However, Worker 1 noted that after the investigation\nconcluded she realized there may have been a violation due to FP1 driving the car\naway while Youth A was leaning into the back seat. However, Worker 1 stated she\nwould not know how to cite that. Worker 1 explained that during the incident Youth A\nwas upset and FP1 did not want her in the car. They were in a van with a sliding\ndoor. FP1 pulled forward in an attempt to make the door slide shut. FP1 understood\nit was not the best decision, but in the heat of the moment, she was concerned\nabout the safety of the other children and wanted to keep Youth A out of the car. I\ndiscussed with Worker 1 which rules the incident could have been cited under.\nWorker 1 stated that since DHHS determined they did not need to investigate, she\nwas under the impression there would not be any findings by the agency either.\nWorker 1 reported that she was not aware of any concerns regarding Youth A or her\nability to care for her child or interact with other children in the home. Worker 1 was\nnot aware of any history of physical violence with children that the foster parents\nneeded to be concerned about in this incident. However, she did note that Youth A\nhas a history of becoming escalated easily and becoming verbally aggressive.\nWorker 1 reported she did not have any concerns about the family or the safety of\nchildren in their home. Although, she noted that she could see how someone from\nthe outside may view the situation. Worker 1 indicated that she could see how a\nviolation may have been cited for this incident.\nDocuments Reviewed\nSER #2 summary: Authored by Worker 2\nOn 11/22/21 it was alleged that FP1 grabbed Youth B by the back of neck. DHHS\nwas assigned. It was noted this was the third complaint regarding the use of physical\nforce with foster children at this home. “Safety Plans” had been developed with the\nfoster parents in the past to refrain from using physical force. During interviews\nYouth B reported FP1 believed she was hiding a cell phone at school. Youth B\ndenied having a phone and walked away to calm down. It was noted this was one of\nthe Youth B’s coping skills. Youth B reported she remained on the property but hid\nbehind a barn for a few hours. Youth B then walked back to the house where FP1\nyelled at her, grabbed her by the back of the neck, then “sat” her down on the couch.\nNo bruises or marks were observed on the youth’s neck. When interviewed, FP1\nand FP2 stated Youth B was posting inappropriate things online while at school. FP2\n4",
    "was not present when FP1 confronted Youth B about the phone. FP1 stated that\nYouth B escalated and left the property. FP1 went out to look for Youth B but could\nnot find her. When Youth B returned, FP1 reportedly put her hand on the youth’s\nshoulder to guide her to sit down. Other children in the home corroborated FP1’s\nversion of events. However, the other children also noted that FP1 will “use her body\nto move (another foster child) out the door to calm down”. A safety plan was\nimplemented that FP1 will never be home alone with the other foster child. DHHS\ndid not have any findings from this investigation. The agency report indicated no\nlicensing violations found.\nLicensing Supervisor\nOn 2/3/22 an interview was conducted with Supervisor via Teams. Regarding SER\n2, Supervisor recalled the investigation and stated that DHHS was involved as well.\nTherefore, Worker 2 “shadowed” the DHHS Worker. Supervisor stated that she\nbelieved their investigation was in-line with DHHS findings. When asked why FP1\nfelt the needs to go “hands on” with Youth B, Supervisor indicated that DHHS\ndetermined the action was not inappropriate. Therefore, the agency did not believe\nthey could find a violation. Supervisor further stated this foster family is experienced\nwith difficult teens and generally does very well with them. In this situation, the foster\nparent was worried if Youth B ran away, she may self-harm. Which is why FP1 did\nnot want Youth B to go to her room. FP 1 then used her hand to guide Youth B to sit\ndown.\nSupervisor was asked about the statement in the report regarding FP1 using her\nbody to move another child out the door and the “safety plans”. It was noted there\nwere no safety plans uploaded in MiSACWIS. Supervisor clarified the safety plans\nwere something the foster parent did on their own. It was not something completed\nwith or approved by the agency. Supervisor also clarified that FP1 “using her body”\nmeant that when the child is escalated, she blocks him with her body to prevent him\nfrom accessing the other children. Typically, FP1 has this child step outside or to\nanother room to calm down.\nSupervisor stated that overall, the agency thinks the foster parents do a really good\njob and there are no concerns.\nWorker 2\nOn 2/3/22 an interview was completed via Teams with Worker 2. Regarding SER 2,\nWorker 2 reported she coordinated her investigation with DHHS. Worker 2 confirmed\nthat Youth B left the home after being instructed by FP1 to stay in the house. Youth\nB had a history of self-harming, which made the foster parents concerned about her\nbeing alone somewhere. When Youth B returned to the house, FP1 wanted to talk\nwith her about the cell phone incident. Youth B wanted to go to her room as that is\none of her coping mechanisms when she is confronted with something she does not\nwant to talk about. FP1 was either concerned about Youth B self-harming or wanted\nYouth B to sit and listen. FP1 felt she could deescalate Youth B and have a\nconversation about the situation. FP1 put her hand on Youth B as an attempt to\n5",
    "have the youth focus. FP1 denied shoving Youth B and denied keeping the youth\nfrom leaving. Worker 2 reported that DHHS did not have any findings as it was\ninconclusive about whether the foster parent pushed the youth or guided them with\nher hand. Therefore, the agency did not have any findings.\nRegarding the statement about FP1 using her body to move another child, Worker 2\nstated she recently reread the report and realized there were details missing. Worker\n2 explained there was a safety plan for this youth as he could become aggressive\ntowards FP1 when escalated. The safety plan was something the family instituted,\nnot the agency. The foster parents used their bodies to block access to other parts\nof the house and guide the youth to his room or outside when escalated. This\ntechnique had been successful with helping the youth deescalate. Worker 2 noted\nthe agency was not aware of this safety plan, or of the youth being aggressive, until\nSER 2. I explained to the worker that additional detail and investigation were\nnecessary regarding this situation.\nDCWL Director\nOn 2/25/22 a meeting was held with agency members and the DCWL Director\nregarding a placement exception request. In the meeting, the Director expressed her\nconcern regarding both incidents. The concerns expressed are in alignment with the\nfindings of this report.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of the\nfollowing information:\n(e) Findings of fact, based upon the evaluation.\n(f) Conclusions regarding licensing rules compliance or\nnoncompliance based on the findings of fact.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency is found to be in violation of this rule as the conclusion\nof two special evaluations did not accurately reflect the information\ncontained in the report.\nSER #1- A violation should have been found due to the foster\nparent’s behavior. While it was unclear if the foster parent grabbed\nthe youth’s hand, or the phone in her hand, this action was\nunnecessary as the youth was not harming anyone with the phone.\nThis action also escalated the youth, leading to the incident with the\ncar. The foster parent admitted to moving the car in an attempt to\nclose the car door, knowing the youth was leaning into the car. The\nfoster parents indicated this was an attempt to keep the youth out of\nthe car as they were afraid of what she would do to the children in\nthe car, although there was no history of the youth being physically\nviolent.\nSER #2- A violation should have been found due to the foster parent\nactions. In this situation, the youth returned to the foster home\nwillingly, and in a safe manner. The youth wanted to be alone to\ndeescalate. Yet the foster parent insisted on discussing the situation\nthat caused the youth to leave the home initially. The foster parent\nalso insisted the youth stay in one area of the home and put her\nhands on the youth to “guide” her to a seat. While the investigation\nfrom DHHS was inconclusive about the youth being pushed or\nguided by the foster parent, the physical interaction by the foster\nparent was unnecessary as the youth was not harming anyone. The\nfoster parent should have used other techniques to address this\nsituation or reached out to the agency for guidance. A CAP\nidentifying additional training in this area could have benefitted the\nfoster parents.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\n DHHS and agency findings may not match, as they are\nassessing different criteria. While DHHS may not have\nfindings in their investigation, or may chose not to open an\ninvestigation, the agency may still find a violation of licensing\nrules.\n During investigations, staff must detail all information in\nreports as if the reader has no knowledge of the case history\nor foster family.\n During investigations, staff must review any documents\nreferenced in the report and indicate what information the\ndocument provided.\n Regarding SER 2, the foster parent’s action of confronting the\nyouth when they returned to the home, and placing their hand\non the youth, may be escalatory or triggering for a youth with\n7",
    "a trauma and a history of self-harm. The foster parent would\nbenefit from additional training regarding the use of coping\nskills, de-escalation techniques, conflict resolution, crisis\nmanagement, or working with kids that have experienced\ntrauma.\n As this home has multiple allegations of physical\nmanagement and no corrective actions plans or safety plans,\nthe agency was informed that it appeared they were not\nidentifying violations or developing CAPs. Any “safety plans”\nimplemented by a foster parent, must also be approved by\nthe agency. Any findings of non-compliance, must have an\napproved CAP.\n Reviewing a foster home’s investigation history is part of the\ninvestigation process, in order to identify and address a\npattern of behavior or needs of the foster parent.\n The agency was reminded that consultation with DCWL is\nalways available if they are ever unsure about investigation\nprocesses or findings.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\n_ ____________March 10, 2022_______\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 11, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
