DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nResponsive Deployment Children’s Shelter is located on the campus of STARR\nCommonwealth in Albion. The facility consists of 13 buildings, which includes 9\ncottages which will house youth, 1 educational/administrative building, 1\nrecreation center, 1 administrative/medical unit building which will house youth\nand a mason/supply building. Upon entering the campus down the main drive,\nyou'll come to a dead end. To the left is the road leading to all the cottages, the\nschool building, and the supply center. To the right is the road leading to the\nadministrative/medical unit and the recreation center.\nThe administrative/medical unit building is called Mary Katherine. One entrance to\nthe Mary Katherine building leads to all the administrative offices and a\nconference room. The other entrance to the Mary Katherine building leads to the\nintake area, which contains a lobby and some offices. It also contains two\nproposed intake units (Towsley Unit & Kresge Unit), which can each\naccommodate up to 15 youth (30 total). One unit will be dedicated for female\nyouth and the other unit will be dedicated for male youth. In each unit there is a\nrecreational/game area, lockers for youth's personal items, bedrooms, a dining\ntable, a staff office, community bathroom/showers, and a laundry room. Mary\nKatherine has a total of 10 bedrooms; 5 bedrooms on each unit. Each bedroom\nhas 2-3 beds/bunk beds. Behind the intake units is a medical area which includes\n2 exam rooms, storage, and a medical office. This is where over-the-counter\nmedications and other medical supplies will be kept, and routine medical exams\n5",
    "will be conducted. The main kitchen is also located in the Mary Katherine building.\nThis is where all the food for the entire campus will be prepared on a 5-week\nrotating menu. Once the food is prepared, it will be transported to each of the\ncottages for everyone to partake in a family-style dinner.\nThe 9 cottages are named Ceeley, Kutshe, Kresge, Herrick, Flynn, Oliver, Kindel,\nAllen and Besser. The first five cottages are proposed to accommodate female\nyouth and the last four cottages are proposed to accommodate male youth. There\nwill not be any co-ed cottages on campus. However, each of the cottages may\nchange their proposed gender accommodations based on the needs of the\nchildren being placed (i.e. if ORR refers more males than females or vice-versa).\nEach of the 9 cottages is an individual, single floor home, and are almost identical\nin their arrangement. Each cottage has 6 bedrooms. Bedrooms have\nbeds/bunkbeds that can accommodate 2-3 youths depending on square footage,\nbut the total number of youths in each cottage will not exceed 14. Each cottage\nhas a staff office, storage closet, closet for chemical storage, living room, dining\nroom, lockers, laundry area, community showers/bathrooms and a\ngame/recreational room. Each cottage also has a kitchen; however, the kitchen\nwill not be utilized for preparing food as the food will be brought to each cottage\nfrom the main kitchen in the Mary Katherine building. Each bedroom is set up with\nwood framed beds or bunkbeds, mattresses, appropriate bedding, desks, and\nchairs. The 13 personal lockers in the home are located as you enter the cottage\nand are available for youths’ personal inventory and property. None of the\nbedrooms in the cottages have doors, so to maintain privacy, all youth will be\nrequired to change their clothes in the bathroom. Only one youth at a time will be\nallowed to be in the shower and/or use the restroom. Each of the bedrooms has\nwindows, but not all windows open. The windows that open have alarms on them.\nEach of the cottages also has a shared basketball court and outdoor picnic tables\nfor outdoor activities.\nThe Montcalm School Klare Building is located between the cottages and the\nMary Katherine building. This building will contain all the clinician offices and case\nmanagement offices, a call center for the youth to speak with their families, a\nconference room, 5-6 classrooms, a staff lounge, a warehouse with shelves for an\noverflow of youth belongings, a computer lab, and a cafeteria. Youth will receive\ntheir education on-site and there will be no more than 30 youth per classroom.\nThe Towsley Center for Recreation is down a small road from the Mary Katherine\nBuilding. The Towsley Center has a large gym with basketball hoops, volleyball,\nracquetball, etc. Down the hall from the gym is a large weight room. There are\nlocker rooms for males and females located within the Towsley Center as well.\nThere is also a large indoor pool located in the building; however, the facility will\nnot be utilizing the pool area, and it will always remain locked. Outside of the\n6",
    "Towsley Center is a large athletic track, which can also be used for recreational\nactivities.\nAn Environmental Health Inspection completed on 12/14/2023 resulted in an \"A\"\nrating.\nSheridan Township approved the facility to be zoned for the purpose of a CCI on\n2/14/24. The facility has working cameras in all the main living areas of each of\nthe buildings, but not in the bedrooms or bathrooms. The cameras have access to\na live stream of those areas and recordings are kept for up to 30 days. There will\nbe a security monitor watching the live feed videos 24/7/365, but this will not\nreplace required supervision or ratio requirements. This is meant to be an added\nlevel of safety and security for the campus. The area surrounding the cottages\nand buildings the agency is using has an 8-foot welded-wire fence for safety and\nsecurity. The security monitor will be doing regular perimeter checks around\ncampus to ensure safety.\nBureau of Fire Services provided a plan review approval for Allen and Kindel\ncottages. Bureau of Fire Services provided an approved final inspection report\ndated 3/21/24 for Allen and Kindel cottages. Responsive Deployment continues to\nwork on bringing the remaining buildings into compliance with fire safety rules.\nB. Program Description\nResponsive Deployment Children's Shelter is a program designed to offer a\ntemporary, safe placement for Unaccompanied Children who are under the care\nof the Office of Refugee and Resettlement (ORR). The facility is being licensed for\na capacity of 156 male and female youth, ages 10-17. None of the cottages will be\nco-ed. However, each of the cottages may change their proposed gender\naccommodations based on the needs of the children being placed (i.e. if ORR\nrefers more males than females or vice-versa). The facility could serve youth from\nvarious parts of the world, but the most common countries include Central\nAmerica, South America, and Mexico. The staff-to-resident ratio is 1:8 during\nawake hours and 1:16 during sleeping hours.\nYouth will stay in the shelter until an identified next placement is found, which\ncould include, but is not limited to, renunciation with a family/sponsor, a more\nappropriate shelter setting, long-term foster care, or repatriation. The average\nlength of stay for youth will be approximately 30-45 days but could be extended if\nit takes longer to find a placement.\nDuring a youth's stay, they will be assigned a bilingual case manager who\nprovides intensive case management services. The youth will meet with their case\nmanager a minimum of once per week. During meetings, the case manager will\nassess and determine what types of supports and interventions are needed.\nServices offered include case management services, unification services, medical\nservices, mental health services (1 individual and 2 group counseling sessions per\n7",
    "week), educational services, recreational services, community outings, and\ninterpretation services. The facility uses the Managing Aggressive Behavior\nmodel for de-escalation and restraints. Crisis intervention and support is available\n24/7.\nC.

RECOMMENDATION\nResponsive Deployment requested a variance which was approved on\nMarch 21, 2024. The variance was granted to allow a license to be issued\nwith a capacity of 156 youth, however only 28 beds (Allen and Kindel\ncottages) at the time of licensure are in full compliance with Part 5 of the\nrules. The remaining 128 beds (Mary Katherine, Besser, Ceeley, Flynn,\nHerrick, Kresge, Oliver, and Kutsche) will gradually come into compliance\nas the agency plans to have the remaining 8 buildings/cottages, come into\nfull compliance by June 3, 2024.\nDuring the time of this variance, youth can only initially be placed in the 28\nbeds located in Allen and Kindel cottages. Mary Katherine, Besser, Ceeley,\nFlynn, Herrick, Kresge, Oliver, and Kutsche cottages will not have youth\nplaced until all of the following is met:\n• All deficiencies for fire safety rules come into compliance.\n• The Bureau of Fire Services have approved the specific\ncottage/building as documented in the plan review report.\n• The Bureau of Fire Services have approved the specific\ncottage/building as documented in the inspection report.\n9",
    "• Division of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL) has approved in writing\nthe cottage/building can begin accepting youth.\nDue to established rule violations, a written corrective action plan is required. Upon\napproval of the corrective action plan, a six-month original license is recommended.\nMarch 21, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 21, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
