On 12/6/2022 the DCWL\nAnalyst contacted the foster care worker and requested the worker to reach out to\nthe relative and have the relative to contact the DCWL Analyst for a home visit for\nthe audit. On 12/11//2022 the relative texted the DCWL Analyst indicating she was",
    "not interested in having such a visit and was refusing the audit. The DCWL Analyst\nadvised the agency to please complete a visit in the unlicensed relative’s home to\nverify the safety of the child in the home.\nResolution:\nOn 12/13/2022 at 3:40 pm, the foster care worker made a home to the unlicensed\nrelative’s home. The worker had face to face contact with the child and caregiver,\nviewed the home, and verified the well-being of the child and home.

Please verify the situation is repaired.\nResolution:\nThe agency contacted the foster parent on 11/29/2022 and 11/30/2022. On\n11/30/22, the foster parent reported that the Water Department came to her home\nand checked the drains, which were all clear and the water had gone down. They\ninstructed her to contact a plumber for future concerns. Several photos were\nprovided to the agency on 11/30/22 showing that there is no longer any water in the\nfoster parent’s basement. The foster parent contacted a plumber and will keep the\nagency informed of any updates as it relates to her basement drains/water issue for\nthe future. The safety concern has been resolved.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\nLonia Perry Calloway Date January 27, 2022\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 30, 2023\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager"
