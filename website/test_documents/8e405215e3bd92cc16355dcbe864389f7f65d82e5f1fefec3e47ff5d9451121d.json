She has seven to ten one-inch cuts on her right\narm from an incident today. There are concerns the youth was\nplaced in the facility inappropriately by the agency.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 3/27/2024 I interviewed the Chief Administrator (CA) about\nthis allegation by telephone. I spoke to the CA again face-to-face\nat the independent living (IL) house on 3/28/2024; and a third time\n2",
    "face-to-face at the agency’s administrative office on 4/5/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS (Michigan Department of Health and\nHuman Services) Worker XX (MDHHS Worker XXX) was also\npresent observing the interview).\nThe CA confirmed Youth A’s placement with the agency. She\nreported Spectrum did not know about Youth A’s current suicidal\nideations and self-harming behaviors when they agreed to Youth\nA’s placement. She described the agency’s intake process. The\nreferring agency provides various documents to Spectrum, which\nshe and the agency’s Intake Worker reviews, discusses; and\nthereafter decides whether to admit the youth for placement. The\nCA reported she makes the final decision as to whom to accept in\nthe program. She said an intake meeting with the potential youth\noccurs; and in most cases there would be a TDM (Team Decision\nMeeting) related to the youth prior to placement occurring. In this\ninstance, with Youth A, a TDM occurred on 3/18/2024. During that\nTDM it was discussed that Youth A was feeling alone. The CA\nsaid that was likely connected to the fact that Youth A had only\nbeen in the home for three days and had not yet entered into\nschool. The CA reported they surmised once Youth A got into\nschool, she would feel better. The CA denied anyone reporting\nduring the TDM that Youth A was having suicidal ideations or self-\nharming behaviors. Nor did anyone report how Youth A reacts to\nnew placements, or Youth A might do so by self-harming. The CA\nadmitted a safety plan was mentioned, but this was in connection\nto MDHHS-POS (Purchase of Service) Worker Y reporting Youth\nA has anxiety, but no specifics.\nThe CA reported based on the referral package/information\nreceived; and what was reported about Youth A before placement,\nYouth A met their program’s eligibility criteria. She reported it was\nreported by Youth A’s previous placement, Vista Maria, that\nagency’s IL program was less appropriate for Youth A as Youth A\nneeded a smaller house environment like Spectrum’s IL program.\nThe CA reported Spectrum’s Whitehorn IL house, where Youth A\nis placed is a smaller setting. It normally houses only three youths;\nand it reopened to take placement of Youth A. She reported\nMDHHS-POS Worker Y; and Youth A knew upfront that Youth A\nwould be the only youth in the house for a while.\nThe CA expressed concern that MDHHS and Vista Maria did not\nshare all appropriate information and details related to Youth A’s\nself-harming behavior or level of need. She said she went back\nand reviewed the referral information to see if she had missed\nanything about Youth A, around her self-harming; and she had\n3",
    "not. She initially acknowledged knowing Youth A’s past\nhospitalization in December 2023 pertaining to suicidal ideations,\nbut later reported only becoming aware of Youth A’s suicidal/ self-\nharming behaviors on 3/23/2023, when an outside source\ncontacted the police to report Youth A was feeling suicidal. The\nCA subsequently clarified she didn’t know these behaviors were\ncurrent.\nThe CA reported after Youth A’s first hospital visit/ incident on\n3/23/2024, she began staffing Whitehorn IL house 24 hours a day\n(as opposed to the program’s contractual required16 hours), so as\nto provide supervision to Youth A, after Youth A’s self-harming\nissues, they also put a written safety plan in place. The CA stated\nSpectrum does take youths with a history of self-harming,\nbehavior, but they did not know those behaviors were active for\nYouth A at the time of Youth A ‘s placement. The CA said Youth\nA’s hospitalization for suicidal ideation would not have been a red\nflag against placing Youth A in their program. They look for three\nmonths of stable behavior; and Youth A appeared to have had\nthat. She reported if there had been an incident of self-harming for\nYouth A in January or February of 2024, that would have been a\nred flag; and they would not have accepted Youth A.\nThe CA reported around 3/25/2023 Spectrum was talking with\nMDHHS about Spectrum’s IL placement not being appropriate for\nYouth A. The CA advised MDHHS that Spectrum could not\naccommodate Youth A for 30 days; and asked for a TDM for\nreplacement consideration. The CA thought residential may be a\nbetter fit for Youth A. MDHHS did not agree, they indicated\nexploration of a relative. The TDM was pending for 4/3/2024.\nOn 3/28/2024 I interviewed the IL Case Manager about this\nallegation by telephone while I was onsite at the IL home. I also\ninterviewed the Case Manager face-to-face at the agency’s\nadministrative office on 4/5/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS\nWorker XX (MDHHS Worker XXX was also present observing the\ninterview). The Case manager reported the CA and Intake\nWorker takes care of the IL homes’ placements. She said she is\nnormally present at TDMs around placements, but she was not\nincluded in Youth A’s. She was not able to say whether MDHHS\nhad indicated a safety plan needed to be in place for Youth A at\nplacement; nor whether a need for safety would be a red flag\nagainst placement. She reported not getting that information from\nMDHHS; and not being able to make such a determination about\nplacement without having seen the specific safety plan MDHHS\nmay have had or indicated.\n4",
    "On 4/3/2024, I interviewed Youth A’s MDHHS-POS Worker Y by\ntelephone. MDHHS-POS Worker Y reported she made the\nplacement of Youth A in Spectrum’s IL program. She said, she is\naware of Youth A’s reports that Youth A was not ready for\nplacement but that was not what Youth A had reported before\nplacement. She reported Youth A’s prior placement was at Vista\nMaria; and as Youth A’s worker she had regular contact with the\nVista Maria staff and Youth A’s therapist about Youth A and Youth\nA’s readiness for replacement from the Vista Maria program. A\nweek prior to Youth A’s placement with Spectrum, MDHHS-POS\nWorker Y said she spoke with Vista Maria Therapist (VMT) about\nperhaps not having Youth A move. The VMT advised if Youth A\nwas not allowed to leave it would be a monumental mental health\nsetback for Youth A. MDHHS- POS Worker Y admitted she had\nsome concerns, but she was going with the therapist’s\nrecommendation; and that fact Youth A had made huge\nimprovements. Youth A also said she was ready, and they had to\ngive Youth A a chance in a less structured setting. She reported\nYouth A did not go into Vista Maria’s IL program on that agency’s\nresidential site, because that program said to wait for Youth A to\nhave an additional 30 days without any incidents, and they would\ntake her. Everyone said Youth A was ready to leave Vista Maria\nfor a less structured program. The VMT expressed if they waited\nto have Youth A go into an IL program Youth A could back-slide\nand her behaviors of suicidal ideation might return. Thus, the\nSpectrum IL placement occurred as Spectrum was able to take\nYouth A sooner.\nMDHHS-POS Worker Y said she and Vista Maria thought Youth A\nmight have a rocky start, may have some acting out behaviors,\nwhich could include suicidal ideations or self-harm, but Youth A\nwould settle in once Youth A saw that she would not be rejected.\nMDHHS-POS Worker Y could not recall whether she told\nSpectrum Youth A could likely self-harm. She reported, if she\ndidn’t tell Spectrum this, she did give them all the incident reports\nfor Youth A, and Vista Maria also gave them paperwork about\nYouth A’s history. She said there was also a TDM on 3/18/204, a\nfew day after Youth A’s placement. At that TDM it was mentioned\nYouth A would have a transition period. She said during Youth A’s\ntransition periods Youth A acts out by self-harming. MDHHS-POS\nWorker Y did not remember if that was told to Spectrum at the\nTDM. She reported she would not have moved forward with\nYouth A’s IL placement if she thought Youth A would not have\nbeen safe in placement. She reported Youth A’s thoughts of\n5",
    "suicide/self-harm after the Spectrum placement may have been\nset off by a loss Youth A learned about.\nOn 4/11/2024 MDHHS Worker XX and I interviewed the Intake\nWorker by telephone. The Intake Worker reported MDHHS- POS\nWorker Y sent Spectrum a referral form on 1/9/2024, and she sent\nMDHHS- POS Worker Y a referral document to complete/of the\npackage of information Spectrum would need. She reported what\nthe CA had related to who reviews the placement\nreferral/information package and who makes the final decision\nabout a youth’s acceptance in the program. She also reported\nbased on the information Spectrum received it was determined\nYouth A was appropriate for their IL program.\nThe Intake Worker also affirmed Youth A’s intake interview at\nplacement on 3/14/2024. Youth A was advised the Whitehorn IL\nhouse was reopening, Youth A would be the only youth in the\nhome, and staff would be there some hours. Additionally, she\naffirmed the CA’s reporting related the agency’s looking to see\nthat a youth has a three-month window of a lack of active mental\nhealth issues to be considered for placement. She reported a\nyouth having suicidal ideations would be a red flag for her and\nreason for discussion with the CA due to the level of\nindependence a youth needs be in their IL programs. She denied\nthere being any reports by MDHHS or in the referral material, that\nYouth A needed greater supervision. She did not recall there\nbeing information in Youth A’s referral package related to Youth A\nbeing hospitalized for suicidal ideations.\nOn 4/15/2024 I interviewed the Vista Maria Therapist (VMT) by\ntelephone. The VMT reported Youth A was in Vista Maria’s short\nterm treatment program from 11/14/2/2023 until 3/14/2024.\nYouth A initially spent more time in the hospital than in the\nprogram. After Youth A’s 12/1/2023- 12/13/2023 hospital stay\nYouth A committed to treatment; did very well; and Youth A was\ninterviewed for different placements. Youth A interviewed with\nVista Maria’s Shepherd Hall’s IL program on 2/13/2024; and\nSpectrum’s IL program on 2/5/2024. Vista Maria’s IL program was\nopen to accepting placement of Youth A, but they wanted 40 more\ndays of stability. The Spectrum program was able to take Youth A\nsooner. Also, Youth A wanted a community-based placement,\nwhich Vista Maria’s Shepherd Hall IL program is less like; and was\nperceived by Youth A that way. The VMT reported Youth A was\nnervous about going into IL placement, but Youth A was ready for\nthe placement. Youth A had come from a community level IL\n6",
    "placement, and Youth A’s choice was Spectrum’s IL program over\nthe Shepherd Hall’s IL program.\nThe VMT reported being in attendance of Youth A’s TDM along\nwith the Spectrum’s Intake Worker and MDHHS-POS Worker Y.\nShe did recall whether there was discussion with Spectrum about\nhow Youth A behaves when Youth A goes into a new placement.\nShe recalled MDHHS-POS Worker Y’s discussion of a safety plan\nrelated to if Youth A was to feel unsafe. MDHHS-POS Worker Y\nverbalized removing all sharp object. The VMT was not sure who\nwas to complete that safety plan but recalled an email from the\nSpectrum’s Intake Worker to MDHHS-POS Worker Y asking\nMDHHS-POS Worker Y if MDHHS completed that safety plan.\nSpectrum needed to include it in Youth A’s file. MDHHS-POS\nWorker Y response to Spectrum Intake Worker was MDHHS-POS\nWorker Y did not recall she was to complete the safety plans, that\nthe safety plan was to be formulated from the discussion at the\nTDM. Spectrum Intake Worker replied to MDHHS-POS Worker Y,\nthis was to be provided by MDHHS.\nDocument Review.\n• Youth A’s MISACWIS case record which showed she is a\npermanent court ward, who has had numerous placements,\ninclusive of a number of past residential placements.\n• A Referral to Spectrum completed by MDHHS that\nindicated Youth A has demonstrated she, can be left alone\nin the home unsupervised and in the community; can be\nunsupervised for at least three hours; has demonstrated\nshe can handle emergencies. That IL will assist her in\ndeveloping life skills to live independently. Additionally,\nYouth A continued area for growth was in mental health,\neducation, and financial literacy.\n• Referral data provided on Youth A that indicated\ninformation as alluded to in this report. It also showed\nYouth A’s last hospital stay was 12/1/2023-12/13/2023.\n• Spectrum’s IL program statement, which showed per the\nreferral data Youth A, age 16, met the program’s\nrequirements, at the time.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per staff and collateral\ninterviews, Youth A was not showing active signs of suicidal\nideation or self-harming behaviors at the time of her placement or\nsince December 2023; she met the agency’s criteria for placement\nat that time. Additionally, Youth A’s MDHHS-POS Worker and\nprior therapist had advised the agency Youth A was ready for\nplacement in a community-based IL placement.\n7",
    "Conclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code Supervision.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12505\nSection (1) An agency shall provide supervision for a youth in independent\nDescription living consistent with the youth's need for supervision, as required\nby R 400.12504(2)(e).\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation (1) The youth is struggling with suicidal ideations and informed\nstaff they wanted to harm themselves, but it was not taken\nseriously. Youth has seven to ten one-inch cuts on her right arm\nfrom today. It is unknown if staff sought medical treatment for\nconcerns. There are concerns of a lack staff supervision for this\n16-year-old youth, who was home alone when she was having\nthoughts of self-harm.\n(2) On 3/27/2024, EMS were called to a residence in Saline\nTownship where the youth was with a friend. The youth and her\nfriend had taken edible gummies. The youth was paranoid and\nmaking suicidal ideations. The youth has new self-harming marks\non her left arm. The youth was taken to the hospital for her\nsuicidal ideations. It is unknown who was supervising the youth.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAllegation (1)\nOn 3/27/2024 I interviewed the CA about this allegation by\ntelephone. I spoke with the CA again about the allegations face-\nto-face at the agency’s Whitehorn IL house on 3/28/2024; and\nface-to-face at the agency’s administrative office on 4/5/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker XX (MDHHS Worker XXX was\nalso present observing the interview)\nThe CA denied the allegations. On 3/27/2024. she reported Youth\nA had gone to the hospital three or four times since Youth A’s\n3/14/2024 placement date; and each time the hospital had\nreleased Youth A. She reported Youth A’s initial thoughts of\nsuicide and self-harming came to the agency’s attention after\nYouth A posted something on social media and a friend/outside\nsource called the police on two separate occasions. In each of\nthose incidents, first on 3/23/2024, then on 3/25/2024 the police\nshowed up at the IL house and reported the incident. Youth A was\ntaken to the hospital by EMS and a staff accompanied Youth A.\nThe CA reported Youth A had not informed them/the staff onsite of\n8",
    "her suicidal thoughts or self-harming. The CA reported each time\nYouth A has reported suicidal or harmful thoughts to staff, they\nhave taken her to the hospital. She reported Youth A seemed to\nhave been trying get to a specific hospital, where Youth A thought\nthey would keep her. Youth A had reported she wanted to get\nadmitted, to stay at a hospital for two weeks; that she would be\nokay after such an admission. The CA said Youth A had not\ndisplayed or reported any incidents of suicidal thoughts or self-\nharming behaviors prior to 3/23/2024. The only unusual incident\nwas related to Youth A dying her hair black.\nThe CA reported after Youth A’s first hospital visit/incident on\n3/23/2024, she began staffing the IL house 24 hours a day (as\nopposed to the program’s contractual required16 hours), so as to\nprovide supervision to Youth A. She said a staff person was at the\nhome with Youth A both on 3/23/2024 and 3/25/2024. Youth\nWorker 3 was the staff on shift at the time of 3/25/2024 reported\nincident; and Youth Worker 1 the staff on shift at the time of the\n3/23/2023 reported incident The CA reported, they also put a\nwritten safety plan in place. She reported the later plan was\nsomething other than some type of plan the MDHHS-POS Worker\nY had wanted prior to these incidents, and which the CA had\nasked the Intake Worker to follow up on. The CA reported she\ninstructed, the Case Manager and the team to put the safety plan\nin place on 3/23/2024. (The CA had provided a copy of that written\nsafety plan to me on 3/27/2024). The safety plan was dated\n3/22/2024, signed by the Case Manager for that date, and signed\nby Youth A on 3/26/2024. The CA believed the Case Manager\nplaced the incorrect date on the plan, that it should have been\ndated 3/23/2024. She reported the staff had been advised verbally\nof the safety concerns, to check on Youth A every 15 minutes,\nmonitor closer, to keep her bedroom door open, the bathroom ajar\nwhen Youth A is inside, and to call the Crisis line Hotline if Youth\nA reported suicidal/harmful thoughts/concerns. On 3/25/2024 she\ntold staff to check the youth’s belonging for sharp objects and to\nremove them. She reported they do not keep sharp items, like\nknifes out in the home. Also, that given, they are an IL program\nthey do not normally go through a youth’s belonging to check for\nobjects. They ask the youths whether they have any weapon, cell\nphones, etc. and document the items. She said youth are allowed\nto have a razor but not razor blades, which was what Youth A\nreportedly used to scratch/cut the various marks on Youth A' arm.\nThe CA said the staff were following the safety plan\nrecommendations.\n9",
    "On 3/28/2024 I interviewed the Case Manager about this\nallegation by telephone, while I was onsite at the IL home. I also\ninterviewed the Case Manager face-to-face at the agency’s\nadministrative office on 4/5/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS\nWorker XX (MDHHS Worker XXX was also present observing the\ninterview). The Case manager reported meeting with Youth A\napproximately six times since Youth A’s 3/14/2024 placement; and\nYouth A had gone to the hospital several times since 3/23/2024.\nShe confirmed the CA’s reporting as to how Youth A’s incident of\nsuicidal thoughts and self-harming behavior came to the agency’s\nattention on 3/23/2024 and 3/25/2024, and the hospital’s repeated\ndischarge of Youth A. She said on 3/23/2024 staff had seen\nYouth A on her tablet, but staff did not know Youth A was posting\nany concerns or thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation. Staff\nthought Youth A was talking and interacting with a friend. The\nCase Manager reported the staff took Youth A to the hospital a\nfew times after that; and staff provided supervision to Youth A at\nthe hospital both when Youth A was transported by the EMS and\nwhen staff took Youth A. The Case Manager said she received\nthose incident reports. She reported after Youth A went to the\nhospital for the cutting of Youth A’s arm on 3/25/2024, staff asked\nthe psychiatrist why the hospital was not keeping Youth A. The\nhospital advised the staff the hospital was referring Youth A to a\ntherapist and Youth A was being discharged. The Case Manager\nreported Youth A went back to the hospital a second time on\n3/25/2024 because Youth A reported having suicidal thoughts.\nStaff called the Crisis Hotline and were advised to take Youth A\nback to the hospital. Staff took Youth A to the hospital in Taylor.\nYouth A didn’t want to go there. Youth A wanted to go to\nAnnapolis hospital, because she thought her chances of getting\nadmitted would be better. Youth A was discharged from that visit\non 3/26/2024 around 6:30pm. Then on 3/27/2024. Youth A left\nthe IL house and was involved in another incident that lead to\nanother hospital visit and overnight stay.\nThe Case Manager reported meeting with Youth A at the IL house\nafter the first incident on 3/25/2024. Youth A had several cut\nmarks on her arm. Youth A told her Youth A was going to “keep\ndoing it” (Youth A didn’t clarify) until the hospital admitted her.\nYouth A reported she used a razor blade to cut her arm. Youth A\nreported having the razor blade in a box of things she brought\nfrom Vista Maria. The Case Manager said a safety plan was\ndeveloped; she met with Youth A about the safety plan and Youth\nA agreed to it and signed the plan.\n10",
    "Case Manager reported the discrepancy with the dates on the\nsafety plan. She said she must have also met with Youth A on\n3/26/2024, after Youth A came home from the hospital. She\nreported she had started the safety plan on 3/22/2023 based on\nMDHHS telling someone (the Case Manager did not say whom) at\nSpectrum that a safety plan was needed, but the Case Manager\ndid not know why. She said she spoke with the staff about\nmonitoring Youth A, and if Youth A exhibited or indicated anything\naround wanting to harm herself the staff was to contact the Crisis\nHotline. She did not recall instructions to staff around removing\npossible items from Youth A’s room, until after the incident of\nYouth A cutting on 3/25/2024. She believed staffing at the IL\nhome changed to 24-hour supervision after Youth A’s reported\nincident on 3/23/2024; but since she does not handle staff\nscheduling, she was not sure of this. She reported prior to Youth\nA’s incidents of self-harming staff were monitoring Youth A as they\nwould any other IL youth. There is nothing in their policy that\nrequires line of site supervision for IL youths. She said, after Youth\nA’s suicidal thoughts incident, and act of self-harming, the staff\nwere instructed to monitor her every 15 minutes, and as\npreviously reported by the CA.\nOn 3/28/2024 I interviewed Complainant X about this allegation\nby telephone. Complainant X reported knowing Youth A and\nYouth B from their placement at another facility; and to being a\nperson who set up a crisis intervention program for them. She\nreported on 3/23/2024 Youth A and Youth B were on a video call\nvia snapchat; and Youth A put a statement out that she was going\nto self-harm. The two youths were talking out loud, as Youth A\nwalked around the house. Youth A told Youth B she had not\ntaken her medication in 24-hours, and she had started to\nhallucinate. Youth A told Youth B there was not a staff at the IL\nhome, and one would not be there until 3:00am. Complainant X\nreported feeling Youth A could be hallucinating, and she advised\nYouth A she had an obligation to call the police. Complainant\ncalled 911 around 7:55pm and the police arrived at the home\nbetween 8:10-8:15pm.\nComplainant X reported as Youth A was walking around the\nhouse, she did not observe a staff there. She said the staff person\nand police arrived around the same time. The staff asked what\nwas going on. Complainant X reported from what she could tell\nthe staff had come from the outside as opposed to another part of\nthe house because Youth A had been sitting by the front door.\nComplainant X reported Youth A did not know the staff’s name\nand had reported that staff had left the home at 1:30pm. Youth A\n11",
    "also reported during her conservation with Youth B, Youth A told\nthe staff before that staff left that she felt anxious, didn’t feel safe,\nand she wanted to harm herself. Youth A said that staff told her\n“that’s your problem and that’s on you if you choose to do that”.\nComplainant X reported being concerned for Youth A.\nComplainant X reported calling the police a second time on Youth\nA’s behalf on 3/25/2024. She reported sometime after 2:00pm\nthat day, she learned Youth A was sending pictures of cuts Youth\nA was making to Youth A’s arm to a friend. Complainant X did not\nsee the photo but assessed that Youth A was in crisis at that\nmoment. She called the police; and the police made a home visit.\nComplainant X denied suggesting to Youth A that Youth A needed\nto be hospitalized for a few weeks to stabilize herself. She\nreported having a conversation with Youth A about Youth A self-\nharming and explained to Youth A if she was going to keep self-\nharming it may be best for Youth A to get into a crisis intervention\nprogram to have her medication evaluated and adjusted, if need.\nComplainant X did not report contacting the IL staff or agency\nadministrator about her concerns with this youth.\nOn 3/28/2024 I interviewed Youth A about this allegation face-to-\nface at Trinity hospital in Ypsilanti, MI. Youth A denied being told\nshe would be the only youth in the home. She said the IL Intake\nWorker completed her intake and told her a staff person would be\nat the home morning, noon and night. She said a staff person\nwas with her when she arrived at the placement the afternoon of\n3/14/2024; and all day the next few days after that. Youth A\nreported one day, the following week, Youth A could not call which\nday, she left the IL home, and when she returned around 3:00pm\nno staff was on site until around 9:00pm. Youth A reported this\nwas the day she was over thinking, and a lot was going on in her\nmind. She said she was facetiming with her friend, Youth B. She\ntold Youth B how she was feeling, and Youth B called the police\nabout her negative feelings. Youth A said she did not call or tell\nthe staff on duty how she was feeling, because no staff was there.\nShe did know that staff name, but reported the staff arrived at the\nhouse about five minutes before the police arrived. Youth A said\nthe staff asked the police what was going on, suggesting the staff\nwas in fact onsite, somewhere prior to the police’s arrival. She\nsaid the police took her to Beaumont Wayne hospital, but the\nhospital did not admit her. She said she was feeling the same as\nwhen she got there, but the hospital only kept her for 24-hours.\nThe hospital discharged her with a referral to New Oakland Family\nService for mental health services. Youth A said the following day\nstaff were with her all day and night. She said she went back to\n12",
    "the hospital on 3/25/2024. She reported that she woke up feeling\nterrible and she carved up her arm. She allowed me to view her\nleft forearm, which had numerous superficial scratch marks on it.\nThe wording “Fat Pig” was also carved into her left forearm. The\ncuts did not appear deep, there was no bleeding, nor bandaging.\nYouth A reported using a razor blade from her art stuff. She had\nthe item in a bag she brought from her last placement. She said\nstaff do not check bags, but once they learned of this, the staff\ntook the razor blade, and later they searched her belongings, and\nremoved various items, sharp objects from the house. She said,\nthe staff found out she had self-harmed that day from the police.\nShe called Youth B; Youth B called the police. The police came\nout to the house and took her to Beaumont hospital.\nYouth A reported Youth Worker (YW) 1 was the staff onsite on\n3/25/2024. She did not tell YW 1 how she was feeling and what\nshe had done, the police did. She said she didn’t tell YW 1,\nbecause YW 1 had overheard her and a friend talking, calling\neach other crazy and YW 1 had called her crazy. Youth A did not\nelaborate on when that exchange between she and YW 1\noccurred; the content in which it occurred, nor why that stopped\nher from telling the staff about her thoughts or act of self-harming.\nShe said the hospital released her again, told her she was fine\nand told her if she had any more problems to talk with the IL staff.\nYouth A reported staff were on duty at the hospital watching her,\nand onsite at the IL home when she returned there. She reported\nthere was nothing staff could have done to stop her from doing\nwhat she had. She reported she did not self-harm due to feeling\nlonely, but reported having another youth in the home would not\nhave hurt.\nOn 4/1/2024 Youth Worker (YW) 1, YW 2, and YW 3 were\ninterviewed about this allegation face-to-face, with MDHHS\nWorker XX at the agency’s Whitehorn IL home. All three staff\nreported the Whitehorn IL house was reopened on about\n3/14/2024 for Youth A’s placement; and that prior to Youth A’s\nplacement they worked at one of the agency’s other IL houses. All\nreported prior to Youth A’s reported thoughts of suicidal on\n3/25/2024, there was no requirement for them to keep a youth in\nthe line of sight. The IL house’s supervision requirement was for\nthem to assist the youths with daily activities/tasks related to\nindependent living. With the exception of YW 3, who did not work\nwith Youth A after 3/23/2024, YW 1, an YW 2 reported after Youth\nA’s incidents, they were advised to, check on Youth A every 10-15\nminutes, ensure that Youth A’s door was kept open; to remove all\n13",
    "sharp objects, to contact the Crisis Hotline should Youth A have\nthoughts of suicide or self-harm and to take her to the hospital if\nneeded.\nYW 1 reported she was the only staff on duty on 3/25/2024; the\nday it came to the agency’s attention that Youth A had self-\nharmed by cutting her arm. She reported around 2:15pm or\n2:30pm, the police arrived at the house. The Officer reported a\nfriend of Youth A’s had called reporting Youth A had harmed\nherself. YW 1 reported being confused about the police’s visit\nbecause she had just checked on Youth A 10–15-minutes prior,\nand Youth A reported being fine. YW 1 said she and the Officer\nwent to Youth A's room; and when the Officer, asked Youth A had\nshe harmed herself, Youth A said, yes, YW 1 reported saying\naloud “no that’s not true”; and at that point Youth A showed her\nleft arm, which had more than 7 scratch cuts to it, and the wording\n“Fat Pig”. Youth A pulled out a razor blade and said, “this is what I\nused” YW 1 reported being stummed by what she was seeing.\nShe said the day had been going fine. She was checking on Youth\nA every10-15 minutes; and Youth A had given no signs of\ndistress. She said that morning Youth A had put on makeup,\nwhereby Youth A had a red colored makeup coming out of her\neyes. Youth A had used scissors with YW 1’s supervision to cut\nstrings from her pants; and Youth A went to her room to do her\nnails. In hindsight YW 1 wonders whether Youth A’s unusual\nmakeup choice may have been some kind of mental health sign\nthat she did not see. She said this had been her first experience\ndealing with something like this. She confiscated the razor blade\nand called her supervisor about this incident. The supervisor\nadvised her to complete an unusual incident report and go to the\nhospital with Youth A, which she did.\nYW 1 reported YW 2 relieved her at the hospital, while the hospital\nexplored sending Youth A home. YW 1 said she went back to the\nIL house to remove sharp objects from the home/cabinets/kitchen\nand to go through Youth A’s belonging for other possible harmful\nobjects. Thereafter they continued following Youth A’s safety\nplan.\nYW 2 reported she was not present at the time of the alleged\nincidents on 3/23/2024. She heard about the incident and was\nadvised it had been a normal day until police arrived reporting the\nconcern. On 3/25/2024, YW 2 relieved YW1 for shift change at\nthe hospital. She observed the cuts to Youth A’s left arm. She\nsaid, Youth A was still threatening to self-harm while at the\nhospital, but the hospital discharged her back to the IL home; with\n14",
    "instructions for therapy and for staff to contact the Crisis Hotline if\nneeded. YW 2 was surprised by Youth A’s discharge but\ntransported Youth A to the IL home. She reported between\n4:00pm and 11:00pm, Youth A was fine. Youth A was having a\nconversation on her tablet. Youth A also met with the Case\nManager and signed-off on her safety plan. YW 2 reported they\nhad operated on a verbal safety plan for Youth A prior to one on\n3/25/2024. She described that plan as YW 1 had related\nmonitoring times, etc. She reported sometime prior to her shift\nending on 3/25/2024, Youth A reported having “the thoughts”,\nYouth A didn’t clarify what kind of thoughts. YW 2 called the New\nOakland Crisis Hotline. A Crisis person spoke with Youth A and\nadvised YW 2 that Youth A needed to be taken to the hospital,\nwhich YW 2 did. That occurred near midnight, and the midnight\nshift staff person came on shift, and the hospital kept Youth A until\nthe following day.\nYW 3 reported being employed by Spectrum for the last 11\nmonths. She reported working three days a week, with her shift\neither being the 4:00pm- 12:00am/Midnight: or 12:00am/midnight\nto 8:00am. YW 3 admitted to being on shift on 3/23/2024, the first\ntime Youth A reportedly went to the hospital. YW 3 reported she\nwas in the staff office getting ready to give Youth A her medication\nwhen the police arrived at the door. The police reported a friend\nhad called and reported Youth A had posted something on social\nmedia about having suicidal thoughts and harming herself. Youth\nA was taken to the hospital.\nYW 3 reported if a youth is talking about self-harming the policy is\nto call the police, call the supervisor and complete an incident\nreport. She denied Youth A making any comments to her about\nwanting to harm herself or of Youth A appearing to talk to herself.\nShe also denied not being onsite at the time the police arrived but\nadmitted to having left to pick up food at 6:30pm. She returned\naround 7:00pm and the police arrived around 8:00pm.\nYW 3 reported no concerns related to Youth A; and she was not\naware of any special needs for Youth A. Nor was she aware of a\nsafety plan for Youth A. She reported she has not worked with\nYouth A since 3/23/2024.\nAllegation (2)\nOn 3/28/2024 I spoke with CA about this allegation face-to-face at\nthe agency’s Whitehorn IL house on 3/28/2024. She reported\nYouth A was not at the IL home when the incident occurred.\nYouth A had left against staff advisement. YW 2 was the staff on\n15",
    "shift at the time of this alleged incident. Youth A ended up at the\nhospital due to Youth A’s action of ingesting an edible, not a lack\nof supervision by any staff person.\nOn 3/28/22024 I interviewed the Case Manager about this\nallegation by telephone, while I was onsite at the IL home. I also\ninterviewed the Case Manager face-to-face at the agency’s\nadministrative office on 4/5/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS\nWorker XX (MDHHS Worker XXX was also present observing the\ninterview). The Case Manager reported Youth A left the IL house\nthe night of 3/27/2024. She reported similar information to what\nthe CA had about the staff trying to get Youth A not to leave the IL\nhome; Youth A leaving anyway. She reported the staff thought\nYouth A was AWOL; and the agency learned after the fact, Youth\nA had eaten an edible while at a friend’s house and someone took\nYouth A to the hospital. Thereafter, staff went to the hospital to be\nwith Youth A.\nOn 3/28/2024 I interviewed Complainant X about this allegation\nby telephone. Complainant X was not the one who reported this\nallegation, but she was aware of the situation. She said Youth A\nwent to visit Youth B against Youth B wishes. Youth A was\npanicky while at Youth B’s and was refusing to go back to the IL\nhome; and Youth B called the police. It was not reported to\nComplainant X that Youth A had any new cuts.\nOn 3/28/2024 I interviewed Youth A about this allegation face-to-\nface at Trinity hospital in Ypsilanti, MI. Youth A said she left the\nIL home on 3/27/2024 to go visit her friend, Youth B. She said\nthe staff on shift, whose name she didn’t recall did not ask her not\nto leave. The staff asked her where she was going, said she had\nto sign out and she did.\nYouth A said she took her anxiety and sleep medication before\nshe left the IL home. She said while she was at Youth B’s home\nshe ate three edibles and had a bad reaction to them She said\nshe thought she would have been fine taking the gummies with\nher medication because in the past she had smoked weed while\non her medication and was fine. She said this time she was not\nreally trying to kill herself. She said she couldn’t move her legs,\nand it felt like her body was attacking her. She said her body was\ntrying to kill her. She reported Youth B called the police, and the\npolice took her to the hospital.\nYW 1, YW 2, and YW 3 were interviewed face- to- face about this\nallegation with MDHHS Worker XX at the agency’s Whitehorn IL\n16",
    "home on 4/1/2024. All three staff reported in general youths in IL\nare able to leave the home. The youth are to sign in and out on\nthe sign in/out sheet.

YW 1 and YW2 reported they\nare not to go out into the community to search for the youth, they\nare to call the police.\nYW1 reported knowing about the alleged incident on 3/27/2024,\nbut not being around when the incident occurred. She reported\nhearing Youth A had left the IL house, and while in the community\nate edible gummies while with a friend, had more marks on her left\narm, and was taken to the hospital. YW 1 reported speaking with\nYouth A at the hospital about what happened. Youth A denied\nsuicidal ideations or getting into a situation with her friend’s\nboyfriend as someone had alleged. Youth A only reported having\na bad reaction to the gummies.\nYW 2 reported she was the staff on shift on 3/27/2024. She\nreported under normal circumstances an IL youth, a youth not on\na safety plan, would be able to leave and go into the community.\nSince Youth A was on a safety plan and it was too close to curfew\nYW 2 advised Youth A against leaving the house. The IL\nSupervisor had also been present and advised the same. Youth A\nleft anyway. Youth A reported she was going to a friend’s and\nwould return by curfew. YW 2 reported they are in an IL home\nand cannot physically keep a youth from leaving. She had Youth A\nsign-out.\nYW 2 reported Youth A missed her curfew time.
