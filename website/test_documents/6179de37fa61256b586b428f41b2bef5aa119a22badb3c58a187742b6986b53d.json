Staff 1 denied touching\nYouth A when she was attempting to stop her from spitting. Staff 3\nalso denied that she choked Youth A or put her hands near her\nneck. She stated she let Youth A go as she was the only one\nattempting to restrain her and policy does not allow a one-person\nrestraint.

She recalled that\nStaff 2 was attempting to calm Youth A down and denied that any of\nthe staff attempted to tap her out. Staff 1 stated that the other staff\npresent only attempted to speak with Youth A. Staff 1 reported that\nshe felt fearful and wanted to leave the pod but could not because\nStaff 3 had already left.

Staff 1 reported\nthat she informed Supervisor 1 that Youth A bit her and that is why\nshe went to Concentra for medical follow up.

DCWL reported preliminary findings of non-compliance with\nlicensing rules and advised that final findings would be provided at\nfinalization of report.\nVideo Review:\nThe footage showed that the incident occurred between 11:08AM\nand 11:11AM.

Staff 2 was\nobserved to be attempting to prevent Youth A from spitting by\nplacing her hand in front of Youth A’s mouth. Youth A was seen\nwalking around/away from Staff 2. Due to the camera angle, it was\ndifficult to see anything additional as they were out of camera view.\nA little later, Staff 3 is seen moving around and engaging with the\nother staff and Youth A. Staff 3 is seen grabbing the arm of Staff 1\nin an attempt to pull her away from the situation and Staff 1 snatches\nher arm back and does not remove herself.\n6",
    "The second video was observed to be from the camera from the\nother side of the hallway and the images are obstructed due to the\ndistance and positioning of youth and staff. During the second video\nthe same actions can be observed by Staff 2 and Staff 3. The\nactions of Staff 1 are observed and she can be seen forcefully\npushing Youth A down into the chair. She can also be seen to be\npushing Youth A, who then rolls in the chair back to the wall. Again\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 are seen attempting to intervene. A few moments\nlater, Supervisor 1 enters through the door and Staff 1 leaves.\nAdditional video footage was provided by Compliance for review\nbased on statements by Youth A that she was inappropriately\nrestrained.
