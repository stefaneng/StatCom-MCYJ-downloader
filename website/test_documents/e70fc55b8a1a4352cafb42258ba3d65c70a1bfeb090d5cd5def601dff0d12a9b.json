She reported being told\nthere was no other staff present from the facility. She is\nquestioning why the facility sent Youth A alone with a male staff\nwhen Youth A has a history of sexual behaviors.

Staff 1 was hired on 7/31/23 and his employment\nwith the facility was terminated on 10/9/23. She reported Staff 1\nwas terminated for several reasons. Several female staff members\nfiled sexual harassment claims against Staff 1, Staff 1 would leave\nhis supervision responsibilities to visit with Youth A in the house\nwhere Youth A was lodged, falling asleep while working, refusing\nto transport a youth, and poor boundaries with youth at the facility.\nAll of these issues are reported to have taken place within a 2-\nweek period. Administrator 1 reported being told about the\nincident during the transport to court by Youth A. Administrator 1\nreported Youth A told her Staff 1 put his hand on Youth A’s\nshoulder and asked Youth A if she felt uncomfortable to which\nYouth A replied no. Staff 1 then placed his hand on Youth A’s\nbreast and again asked if Youth A felt uncomfortable and Youth A\nagain said no. Staff 1 then asked Youth A if Youth A would give\nStaff 1 “head”. Youth A is reported to have not been forced but\nfelt that Youth A could not say no. Administrator 1 reported Youth\nA informed her, Youth A was communicating with Staff 1 on\nFacebook and Youth A showed Administrator 1 the text messages\nbeing exchanged between Youth A and Staff 1. Administrator 1\nreported Youth A informed her that the message about Youth A\ngiving “head” to Staff 1 was deleted by Youth A. Youth A informed\nAdministrator 1, Staff 1 believed he would lose custody of his\nchildren if someone found out what he had done. Youth A told\nAdministrator 1, Staff 1 was smoking marijuana and asked if\nYouth A would like to smoke marijuana with him. Youth A reported\nStaff 1 asked Youth A to have sex with him. Administrator 1\nreported the day before the report was made to MDHHS, Youth A\nattempted to go AWOL, and another (unidentified) youth reported\nYouth A was attempting to meet with Staff 1. Youth A later\nadmitted to Administrator 1 that Youth A was trying to meet with\nStaff 1.

Youth A reported being told by MDHHS to get\nStaff 1 to talk. Administrator 1 reported Supervisor 1 was the\nsupervisor on duty when Staff 1 was assigned to transport Youth\nA to court and the facility has no transportation policy nor\ntransportation logs.

Supervisor 1\nfound Staff 1 to transport Youth A, and she had no awareness of\nany issues between Youth A and Staff 1. Supervisor 1 reported\nthere are no policies about having a staff of the opposite gender\ntransport youth and doesn’t see this as an issue because several\nof the youth are LGBTQ which Supervisor 1 believes negates the\nissue of cross gender transportation. When asked about the prior\nspecial investigation involving Youth A and exposing herself to a\npeer, Supervisor 1 reported this took place months prior and didn’t\ninterfere with her judgement.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 11/7/23\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker and Law Enforcement.\nShe reported being told last week by Youth A about the\nallegations of Youth A giving oral sex to Staff 1 during the\ntransport to a court hearing.

Youth A also\nreported to Staff 2, Staff 1 wanted more sex on the ride back to\nthe facility, so Youth A put Youth A’s vagina on Staff 1, but Youth\nA gave no clear details about this action. Staff 2 reported when\nYouth A informed staff about the allegations, Supervisor 2 was\nalso present. Staff 2 does not fully believe the allegations because\nYouth A was smiling and happy when telling Staff 2 about the\nallegations and Youth A has a habit of making up stories for\nattention. Staff 2 reported observing Staff 1 come into work early\nand “hanging out” with Youth A at Youth A’s residency. Staff 2\nreported there is a policy that staff are not to come to campus\nunless they are on the “clock”. Staff 2 believed Staff 1 could have\nbeen more professional as Staff 1 acted more like a friend to the\nyouth than a staff. Staff 2 denied telling management about her\n5",

Youth A wanted to be tested\nfor venereal disease.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n11/16/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker and Law\nEnforcement. He reported not being aware of the allegations and\nwas not Staff 1’s direct supervisor. He did not have any concerns\nabout Staff 1 and found the youth to really like Staff 1.

Staff 1 appeared to gravitate towards Youth A,\nYouth C, and Youth D. In regard to the transportation of youth,\nstaff are assigned the day of the transport and assigned by the\nsupervisor present. The supervisor will consider which staff will\nmake the youth the most comfortable and a youth can request a\nspecific staff to transport them.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n11/16/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker and Law\nEnforcement. He reported being Staff 1’s direct supervisor and\ndescribed Staff 1 as being nice and trying to build relationships\nwith the youth. He reported having no concerns about Staff 1’s\nwork in the treatment home he was assigned to work in. Staff 1\nwould come to work early and at times would stay late. Supervisor\n3 thought Staff 1 just wanted to help out. There were no concerns\nof Staff 1 transporting youth to different appointments. Supervisor\n3 reported Staff 1 did not work in the house with Youth A very\nmuch and he was unaware of the situation with the transportation\ndocumented in the allegations. Supervisor 3 reported\nunderstanding Staff 1 was trying to have relationships with other\nstaff, but Supervisor 3 believed it was not his place of what staff\ndo outside of the work environment.

Youth A reported Staff 4\nwas going to take Youth A to court but feared driving on the\nhighway so Staff 1 said Staff 1 would drive Youth A to court. On\nthe way back, Staff 1 first touched Youth A’s shoulder, then breast\nbefore asking Youth A to give Staff 1 “head”. Each time Staff 1\nwould touch Youth A, Staff 1 would ask if his touch was too much\nfor Youth A. Youth A reported telling Staff 1 no when Staff 1 asked\nfor “head” because Youth A was scared. Youth A reported feeling\nscared because Staff 1 was 20 years old, and Youth A was only\n16 years old. Youth A reported this interaction took place on the\nway back from the court hearing. Staff 1 wanted to touch Youth\nA’s breasts in the elevator when they were leaving because Youth\nA was making Staff 1 “hard”. Staff 1 took Youth A to a Walgreens\nupon leaving the court building and once in the parking lot of the\nWalgreens asked for “head”. Youth A reported Staff 1 climbed in\nthe back seat of the vehicle and Youth A followed. Youth A told\nStaff 1 she didn’t want to engage in the activity, but Staff 1 pushed\nYouth A’s dress up to her breasts. When Youth A asked Staff 1\nwhy he pushed Youth A’s dress up, Staff 1 became angry with\nYouth A, so Youth A began to give Staff 1 “head”. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 ejaculated in Youth A’s mouth. Staff 1 tried to rub\nthe cum on Youth A’s breast before telling Youth A thank you.\nYouth A denied vaginal penetration by Staff 1 but wanted to be\ntested for sexual transmitted diseases because Staff 1 had\n“bumps” on his penis.

The day of the transport Staff 4 realized she would have\nto drive on the highway and because of a prior accident, she is\nfearful of highway driving.
