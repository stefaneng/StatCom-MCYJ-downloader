Youth A\nreported when she was in the hot tub area with these two male\npeers, Staff 1, Staff 2, and Youth B were sitting there listening to the\nconversation, which she noted was appropriate. Youth A reported\nYouth B wanted to leave, so Staff 2 walked her upfront while Staff 1\nstayed with Youth A. She reported after a bit of time she headed to\nthe family locker room to change and Staff 1 followed her. Youth A\nreported in the family locker room there are single-stall rooms so she\ncould change in privacy and reported typically staff stand outside the\ndoor until the youth comes out. She reported she went into the\nsingle-stall room to change and Staff 1 was standing there when she\nclosed the door. Youth A reported Staff 1 knocked on the\ndoor asking her if she was still in there which she responded she\nwas. She reported she thought that was strange that she was being\nasked because Staff 1 would know if she left the room if she was\nstanding where staff are supposed to be.

She\nreported she came out of the room and left to go back to the facility\nwith Staff 1, Staff 2, and Youth B.
