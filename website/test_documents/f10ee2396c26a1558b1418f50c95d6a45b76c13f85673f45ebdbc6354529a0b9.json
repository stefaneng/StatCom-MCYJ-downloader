INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327 Special evaluation\nSection\nDescription\n1",
    "(1) Upon receipt of any information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule, the agency must do all\nthe following:\n(b) Initiate a special evaluation of the foster home as soon as is\nindicated, based on the information received, but not later than 7\ncalendar days after receipt of the information.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency was aware that the foster parents were allowing a\nchild to sleep in a basement bedroom which did not meet licensing\nstandards, and the agency did not initiate a special investigation,\nnor submit for a variance to the rule.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 6/10/2025 I spoke with Division of Child Welfare Licensing\nAnalyst (DCWLA) by telephone related to the allegations.\nDCWLA confirmed the information in the complaint. She reported\nthe agency was aware Child A (age 2) was sleeping in a living\narea in the basement of the family’s new home as a bedroom, and\nthe room does not meet bedroom compliance, per the foster home\nlicensing rules. DCWLA reported the agency’s licensing worker\nassessed the foster home on 5/12/2025 and told the family the\nspace was okay for the child to use as a bedroom. DCWLA\nreported there is no door directly leaving in and out of the room;\nthat the entrance to the garage is used as an entrance, which\nenters a mudroom; and the mudroom enters directly into the\nchild’s room. Additionally, this room as a bedroom does not\nensure rest and privacy for the child; and does not have the\nrequired items permitting it as a bedroom, such as closet, and\ndresser. DCWLA also reported that pending the agency getting a\nvariance submitted and approved, the current safety plan is for\nChild A to sleep in the room with his brother. The latter is\nreportedly where Child A slept previously.\nOn 6/12/2025 I interviewed Chief Administrator (CA) about the\nallegations by telephone. CA reported Foster 2 is an architect and\nthe family is residing in a new home Foster Parent 2 designed.\nThat, with respect to the complaint, the issue seems to be around\na garage door, and where the child is sleeping. CA reported\nbased on Licensing Worker’s assessment of the foster home\nrules, the room in question, how the home is set up, Licensing\nWorker assessed that the room was appropriate for the child to\nuse as a bedroom. CA reported the foster parents’ garage was\nnot being utilized and Licensing Worker believed the room met all\nlicensing requirements. CA reported the foster care staff was\n2",
    "aware of the child’s sleeping quarters, and all felt it was okay. CA\nreported the child was originally sleeping in a bedroom with his\nsibling, but the sibling was keeping this child up and Foster Parent\n1 and Foster Parent 2 moved the child to enable him to get rest.\nCA reported the family is willing to install a door, but that was not\nconsidered in discussion with DCWL (Division of Child Welfare\nLicensing) Manager, whom the agency had gone back and forth\nwith over this matter, and a variance being needed. CA reported\nthe variance has already been submitted.\nOn 6/17/2025, I interviewed Licensing Supervisor (LS) about the\nallegations by telephone. LS reported Licensing Worker was\naware of Foster Parent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s sleeping\narrangement for Child A prior to DCWL indicating a concern with\nthat arrangement. LS reported that Licensing Worker had received\na call from either Foster Parent 1 or Foster Parent 2 who\nexplained that Child A’s brother, Child B (age 3), whom Child A\nhad shared a room with, was causing sleeping difficulties for Child\nA, and they wanted to move Child A into the basement area. LS\nreported that the basement area is fully furnished, and the\nLicensing Worker inquired of the foster parent whether the room\nthe foster parents were moving Child A to had a required smoke\ndetector, space for Child A’s clothing, a closet, means of egress\nand allowed for privacy; and Licensing Worker was advised it did.\nLS acknowledged that Licensing Worker did not advise Foster\nParent 1 and Foster Parent 2 she needed to come out to view the\nroom/area so as to ensure the room/area met licensing\nrequirements. LS reported Licensing Worker had recently gone to\nthe foster family’s home for their licensing reevaluation. Licensing\nWorker had knowledge of the room. LS reported Licensing Worker\nwas aware that the room was off from a mudroom and Licensing\nWorker had deemed the room appropriate. LS reported DCWL’s\nconcern seems to be that this basement room, which can be\naccessed from a door from the garage, does not meet foster\nparent rules’ privacy requirements. LS reported Foster Parent 1\nand Foster Parent 2 had recently built this home; and the garage\nis not the entryway into the home. He reported he/the agency\ndoes not fully understand DCWL Analyst’s assessment of this\nsituation; and that they had gone back and forth with her over this\nmatter. He reported in the future, if the agency sees something\nlike this room situation, the agency will request a variance for the\nbedroom. He reported a special evaluation on Foster Parent 1’s\nand Foster Parent 2’s foster home, around this matter, had since\nbeen opened.\n3",
    "On 6/17/2025 I interviewed Licensing Worker (LW) by telephone.\nLW was aware of the allegations but reported she had some\nconfusion on the matter. She reported the first safety alert the\nagency received from DCWL Analyst was about a smoke alarm,\nbut there was already a smoke alarm in the area. She reported\nthe room DCWL reported concern with had all the things needed\nfor a bedroom. She reported on 5/12/2025 while at Foster Parent\n1’s and Foster Parent 2’s home they spoke with her about\nchanging Child A’s room due to Child B being a noisy sleeper and\nkeeping Child A up at night. LW reported not being sure whether\nshe went down to the basement to assess the room on 5/12/2025.\nShe stated she had gone down to the basement space in\nDecember 2024 when she had gone to assess this home after the\nfamily had moved there. She reported Foster Parent 1 and Foster\nParent 2 had designed the home with extra space, and there had\nnot been a set purpose for the room area when the family moved\nin. LW said the family made the room change to allow Child A to\nobtain rest and peaceful sleep. She reported what she recalled of\nthe space, was it was okay and appropriate because Child A was\nable to have his crib down there; there was a smoke alarm located\nin the room area and outside near the steps on the main floor; a\nmeans of egress existed by way of a sliding glass door that walks\nout to the side level of the house, the patio area. LW reported she\ndid not think of the privacy aspect. She was looking at the fact that\nthe room switch would avail Child A of the ability to sleep without\nbeing awakened by Child B ’s loud moaning/ self-soothing\ntechnique for himself. She reported now understanding the\nconcern being the room where Child A is allowed to sleep\nconnects to the mudroom and the room can be accessed via the\ngarage and does not have a private entrance.\nLW reported she completed a variance related to the room being\nused as a bedroom, but DCWL then reported a concern with Child\nA, a toddler, being in the basement. She said to correct the\nmatter, Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 have moved Child A\nback into the bedroom with Child B.\nOn 6/26/2025 I interviewed Foster Parent 1 by telephone. Foster\nParent 1 confirmed information reported as to why Child A was\nseparated from Child B to sleep, and where his bedroom area was\nrelocated to. She thought moving Child A to the basement room\nwould be best until she and Foster Parent 2 could find another\nsolution. She reported once they decided to move Child A to the\nbasement room, they did not contact their licensing worker about\nthe move, because LW knew. She said LW had been in and out of\ntheir home; that they moved to their new home prior. LW came out\n4",
    "to see the home for their address change; and they told LW Child\nA would be in the basement room. Foster Parent 1 reported LW\nviewed the basement area/room at that time, and did not evaluate\nit as not appropriate or needing a variance.\nFoster Parent 1 described their home as a three-level home with\nfully finished basement and garage. She described the basement\narea and room, in question for this complaint to be finished room\nwith a closet and there is a door with a handle at the head of the\nstairs. There is also a sliding door in the room that leads outside to\na patio. There is another door that leads to the garage, which she\nsaid, she was advised is the licensing issue/problem now. She\nsaid if one walks in from the garage there is a room with the crib\nfor Child A’s bedroom, and there is a mudroom, but there is no\nprivate entrance for Child A’s room. Foster Parent 1 affirmed\nLW’s reporting they moved Child A back into the bedroom with\nChild B.\nDocument Review:\nChild A’s and Child B’s MISACWIS record which showed:\no They were placed in Foster Parent 1’s and Foster Parent\n2’s foster home on 5/2/2024 and 6/9/2023 respectively.\nDCWL Safety Alert dated 5/22/2025 which indicated:\no Child A is sleeping in the basement living room which has\nnot been assessed as a bedroom in the home.\no The agency’s response which indicated Child A was/is\nsleeping in the basement and the area had been assessed\nas appropriate by licensing on 5/12/2025. Additionally,\nsince DCWL’s concern with the basement space, on\n5/29/2025, the family moved a pack and play into Child B’s\nroom for Child A, until the agency completes a variance for\nthe space. A photo of the pack and play, in place was\nshown. The agency further indicated a variance had been\ndrafted.\nPhotos of the basement area which showed:\no A living room area with a crib, a sofa chair and toys on the\nfloor.\no A sliding glass door in the same room appeared to lead to\nthe outside where a trailer or camper was seen outside on\na cemented driveway.\no An area where a white door with a handle was seen near\nstairs.\nFloor Plan which showed by arrows pointing to/identifying:\n5",
    "o The area where a bed is identified to be located.\no A smoke alarm near the room where the bed was\nidentified.\no A closet under the stairs.\no A door to the upstairs\no An egress door, which was on the opposite side, away\nfrom the room with the bed.\no A smoke alarm plus Carbon Monoxide device near the\negress door.\no An egress door/window, which appeared to be the sliding\ndoor seen in photos, mentioned above in this area.\nFoster Parent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s 6/24/2024 reevaluation;\n1/15/2025 relocation evaluation; and 7/11/2025 reevaluation which\nindicated:\no During the first reevaluation Child A was in a crib in Foster\nParent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s bedroom.\no During the relocation reevaluation the report indicated the\nfinal bedroom had two cribs and was used for placements.\nThis reevaluation also indicated that down the stairs in the\nbasement, there is a second living room area with chairs,\nworkout equipment, and a sliding glass door to the side\npatio of the home. Nobody was indicated to occupy a room\ndownstairs in the basement.\no The 7/11/2025 revaluation indicated Child A occupied a\nbedroom with a crib to the east of Child B’s bedroom.\nAnalysis The evidence showed at the time of the complaint Child A was\nbeing allowed to sleep in a living room area in the family’s\nbasement which did not meet foster home licensing requirements,\nrelated to rest and privacy; and the agency had not requested a\nvariance to request an exception to the rule, nor had it initiated a\nspecial evaluation on the foster home related to the\nnoncompliance. It is noteworthy that prior to the writing of this\nreport the agency had since initiated both.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency\ncurrent license status is recommended.\nAugust 7, 2025\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 19, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n7"
