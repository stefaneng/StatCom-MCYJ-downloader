    "need for care.\nTwo of three resident records were non-compliant.\nOne resident had no initial placement outline.\nOne resident’s initial placement outline was not completed\nweeks after the time of admission.\nR 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; initial treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and date\nan initial treatment plan for each resident within 30\ncalendar days of admission.\nTwo of three ITPs were completed 4 and 6 days late.\nR 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; updated treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and date\nan updated treatment plan for each resident at least once\nevery 90-calendar days following the initial treatment\nplan.\nTwo of four UTPs were completed 2 and 13 days late.\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan.\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional care, all of\nthe following information shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n3",

    "One resident had no documentation that aftercare services were\nprovided.\nOne resident was only visited once in the first 30 days after\ndischarge.\n(repeat non-compliance)\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nDuring this licensing period, Girlstown has struggled to maintain a sufficient number of\ndirect care staff. Also five of seven staff were new to their positions in 2019. To\nmaintain the required staff-to-resident ratio, the facility has been utilizing clinical and\nmanagement staff to provide direct care. This month, there was a great deal of staff\nturnover. A supervisor of direct care staff was terminated, a therapist resigned, the\nformer supervisor of direct care staff was re-hired and two new direct care staff were\nhired.\nI requested the facility submit an interim plan identifying who will be responsible for\nproviding therapy, writing ITPs/UTPs, and supervising/approving ITPs/UTPs until a\ntherapist is hired and trained. The person supervising/approving the reports cannot be\nthe same person writing them. Once Girlstown is fully staffed, I suggest all employee’s\nadhere to their designated roles. If the case manager position needs to be versatile (ie,\nto provide direct care at times), that should be included in the job description. If a new\ntherapist is hired, I recommend the therapist be the sole person responsible for writing\nreports.\nPersonnel information for each intern should be organized and maintained separately\nin its own file.\nContinue using the discharge form developed by Girlstown that meets all of the\nlicensing rule requirements.\nThe child status section of updated treatment plans should assess and summarize\nthe resident’s behavioral/emotional functioning throughout the designated report\nperiod.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nPer R 400.4156 (3) (a) – Dates, persons contacted, type of contact, and place of\ncontact should be included in the updated treatment plan (social work contacts).\n5",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility submitted one acceptable corrective action plan resulting from the\nRenewal inspection of 2019 in which the following was cited:\nR 400.4128 (3) Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training\nR 400.4144 (2) (b) Admission health screening; physical examinations\nR 400.4152 (a) (c) (d) (h) Initial documentation\nRFCAN Contract 2.10, pg 27 Planned discharge – contact\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective\naction plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on their regular license.\nFebruary 3, 2020\n________________________________________\nDate\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 3, 2020\n6",
