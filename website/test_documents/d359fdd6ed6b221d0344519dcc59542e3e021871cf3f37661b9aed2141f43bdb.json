    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. Special evaluation 2024SEC0001578 was initiated on 5/6/2024 regarding\nallegations a licensed foster parent utilized corporal punishment. The licensed\nfoster parent was found in violation of licensing rules. The evaluation was thorough\nand well written. A CAP was implemented that is still in place.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency renewal inspection was completed on 8/24/2023 and the CAP was\napproved on 9/20/2023. The agency was cited for 10 violations, 3 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 3, there was an improvement in individual incidents of\nnon-compliance within 2 of the violation areas (placement outline and supervisor\napproval) and an increase in the number of individual incidents in 1 area (PATP).\nIn 2022, 8 violations were established, 2 of which were repeated this year. All of\nthe repeated violations remain close to the same number of individual incidents of\nnon-compliances. The agency will need to establish additional corrective planning\nfor the repeated violations to ensure a reduction of incidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated the previous year's CAP has had a positive impact on overall agency\ncompliance. For the past several years the agency has included direct staff,\nsupervisors and program manager in development of their CAP. The chief\nadministrator indicated this has been helpful to ensure all staff understand the\nexpectations. The CA also noted the agency experienced placement disruptions\ninvolving older youth.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisors and coworkers are available to assist as\nneeded. Staff did not report any concerns.\n7",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n____10/7/2024_______________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/08/2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n8"
