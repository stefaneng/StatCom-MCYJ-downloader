    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n The agency was reminded to generate/save reports, to make them accessible\nunder the documents hyperlink in MiSACWIS. The agency also was advised to\ncontact the help desk if they have any problems with reports; then document the\ncontact and ticket number for the issue.\n PATPs must have dates with the signatures to verify they were signed within the\nrequired timeframe.\n For licensing renewals and annuals, the 4004 report and 3080 compliance record\nmust both identify the agency’s recommendation, including specifics such as the\nnumber of children, age, gender, and characteristics.

Children should receive\ntheir COVID-19 vaccine unless their medical provider indicated the child should\nnot receive it due to a medical condition, or if the parent of a temporary court\nward refuses the vaccine.\n7",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP, approved 2/16/21, was required after the 1/27/21 interim inspection. The\n2021 inspection found 10 violations of licensing rules and DHHS contract. The\n2/10/20 renewal inspection found 13 violations. During the current review, six repeat\nviolations were found. However, it should be noted the agency has made many\nchanges over the past year, including a new chief administrator, and additional staff.\nThese changes have supported many improvements and it is anticipated these\nareas will continue to improve over the next year.\nA CAP, approved 7/8/21, was required after special investigation 2021C0207012\nwas completed on 6/14/21. The investigation determined violation of rules 309\nRecords check, 319 Substitute care policy, 206 Staff qualifications, and 327 Special\nevaluations. These violations were found due a foster home having an unapproved\nperson living in the home. The agency became aware of the situation but did not\naddress it appropriately or complete a thorough investigation per licensing rules. At\nthis time, the issue with the foster home has been resolved. The agency has\nimplemented their CAP and no further concerns were determined.\nA CAP, approved 8/31/2021, was required after special investigation 2021C0207019\nwas completed on 8/10/21. The investigation determined a repeat violation of rule\n325 License recommendation and a violation of rule 404 Placement. These\nviolations were found due to special evaluation reports lacking content required by\nlicensing rules and due to the foster home’s license not specifying a placement type\nthey had accepted. The agency has implemented their CAP and no further concerns\nwere determined.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed during the\nentrance meeting on 12/13/21. The Chief Administrator (CA) is new to the position\nthis year and reports the transition to have gone well. The CA reported the agency\nhas been understaffed over the past three years, which has resulted in difficulty\nmeeting licensing/contract requirements. This year a full-time licensing, foster care\nand adoption staff were all added. A part time licensing worker was also added, but\nlater left. The CA reported the CAP from the 2021 Interim assessment was\nimplemented immediately and included new practices, updated forms, additional\ntraining, and supervision. Clerical staff have also assisted with tracking due dates,\nwhich has assisted case workers. Administration has been reviewing case files,\nCAPS, and following-up with staff. Staff are included in reviews and reminders on a\nregular basis, which has helped with compliance and made staff more aware of\n8",
    "requirements and expectations. The result has been that staff have become more\nconfident in their work and able to assist co-workers when needed. Overall, the CA\nreports feeling positive about the changes during this past year.\nInterviews\nTwo staff members were interviewed and reported significant positive changes over\nthe past year. Both staff indicated the CAP from 2021 is reviewed frequently and has\nhelped the agency improve in several areas. Neither staff had any concerns\nregarding the agency.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, and contract/policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be\nissued a renewal of their regular license.\n_ _________________January 6, 2022_____________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 7, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n9"
