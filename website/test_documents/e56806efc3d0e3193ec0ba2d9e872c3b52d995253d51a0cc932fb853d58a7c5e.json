He recalled the incident in\nquestion. Youth A recalled that all the youth in the unit were going\ninto their group session, and he did not hear Staff 1 tell them to\nget a notebook and pencil. He stood up to go to his room to get\none. Youth A recalled Staff 1 stepping in front of him and telling\nhim to stop because another youth was going to get one at that\ntime. Youth A recalled stating to Staff 1 “Not everything is going\nto go your way” while telling him he was still going to go to his\nroom. Youth A recalled Staff 1 stating he was a “16 year old\njuvenile” in response. Youth A stated he and Staff 1 started\narguing and Staff 1 repeatedly told him he was not going to go to\nhis room, and instructed Youth A to sit down. Youth A stated he\nthen tried moving around Staff 1 to get past him. Youth A believed\nStaff 1 then shoved him first, and Youth A confirmed he shoved\nStaff 1 back. He then clarified this largely occurred at the same\ntime. Youth A stated he then tried to fight Staff 1 and the situation\nescalated physically. He recalled Staff 2 and Staff 3 getting\ninvolved to try to stop the fighting. Youth A could not remember\nspecifics next but recalled he eventually went to the ground on his\nback, and Staff 1 and Staff 3 were next to him. Youth A recalled\nStaff 3 lifting him up off of the ground and putting his arm around\n2",
    "him and walking him out the side door of the unit. Youth A gave\ncredit to Staff 3 for de-escalating the situation.\nYouth B was interviewed on 05/24/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He stated he saw the beginning of\nthe situation and described it as Youth A trying to shove and kick\nStaff 1, with Staff 1 shoving Youth A back.\nYouth C was interviewed on 05/24/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled being present for the\nincident in question. He stated both Youth A and Staff 1 started\npushing each other simultaneously and when other staff had to\nget involved, he was instructed to leave the common area of the\nunit and go to his room.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone on 06/06/2024. She stated\nshe was present for the incident of concern. She recalled it began\nwith Youth A leaving the group to go back to his room, and Staff 1\nstepped in between to block him. Staff 2 could not recall what\nYouth A or Staff 1 said to each other. She recalled this escalated\ninto bumping chests and shoving quickly. Staff 2 could not recall\nwho put their hands on who first, but confirmed both individuals\nwere pushing each other. Staff 2 recalled she and Staff 3\nattempting to get in between Youth A and Staff 1. She stated she\ndisengaged when Staff 1 and Staff 3 attempted a restraint move\nwith Youth A as he was throwing punches.

Staff 3 recalled a pushing match\nbeginning at that time, with Youth A initiating physical contact but\nStaff 1 reciprocating by pushing back at Youth A.

    "Staff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 06/06/2024. He\nrecalled that he was trying to get Youth A to wait to go down the\nhallway to his room when Youth A approached him. Staff 1 stated\nthat this was protocol to ensure that only one youth were near the\nbedrooms at a time when the rest of the group is in the separate\ncommon area. Staff 1 stated he calmly explained this to Youth A.\nStaff 1 recalled Youth A walking into his chest, and Staff 1 then\nput his arms out to use proxemics and keep Youth A at a distance.\nStaff 1 recalled Youth A stating he “didn't have time for that” when\nbeing instructed to wait, and Staff 1 stating in response “I need\nyou to do what you need to do.” Staff 1 denied calling Youth A a\ndelinquent during the interaction. Staff 1 recalled Youth A\ncontinued to escalate, bumping into his chest and eventually\npushing Staff 1 first. Staff 1 stated he pushed Youth A back. Staff\n1 recalled Youth A then escalating more to throwing punches and\npushing with greater force. Staff 1 believed this was when Staff 2\nand Staff 3 intervened and attempted to restrain Youth A. A few\nseconds later Staff 1 stated he took Staff 2’s place in the restraint\nattempt because she was smaller than him and Youth A was\nescalated. Staff 1 and Staff 3 attempted a proper standing team\ncontrol restraint hold and this was immediately not effective\nbecause of Youth A fighting back and falling to the ground. Staff 1\nrecalled that Staff 3 assisted Youth A back up and then took him\noutside of the unit to de-escalate.\nVideo reviewed:\nVideo footage of 05/18/2024 from within the unit was reviewed on\n05/24/2024. No audio was available for the footage. The\ncommon area of the unit was in view with several youth sitting\ndown. Youth A was seen at the beginning of the hallway when his\npath was impeded by Staff 1. They could be seen talking to each\nother. Youth A attempted to step around Staff 1 and Staff 1 kept\nstepping with him to not allow him to pass by. As Staff 2 is walking\npast them to their left, Staff 1 can be seen raising his right arm\nand making contact with the left shoulder of Youth A. Youth A\nthen attempted to move past Staff 1 to his right and Staff 1 and\nYouth A bumped chests as described in interviews. Staff 1 then\npushed Youth A back with his right hand. Youth A attempted to\nwalk past Staff 1 again. Staff 1 then pushed Youth A back a\nsecond time in a similar manner. Youth A then leaned into Staff\n1’s space and the two began pushing and grappling, escalating\nphysically. Staff 2 and Staff 3 attempted to intervene between the\ntwo unsuccessfully. As Youth A continued to be escalated Staff 1\nand Staff 3 could be seen attempting a standing team control\nrestraint of Youth A. Youth A struggled during this attempt and he\nand Staff 1 fell to the ground. Youth A turned to his back upon\n4",
    "landing on the ground, and then proceeded to kick up at Staff 1.\nStaff 1 grabbed on to Youth A’s feet and threw them to his right\nside on to the ground. Youth A then got up and while Staff 3 still\nhad hands on him, moved to the side of the common area room.\nStaff 3 then could be seen walking Youth A out of the side door of\nthe unit and Youth A appeared to be de-escalating.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Staff 1’s personnel file was reviewed and there was no\ndiscipline noted. He was up to date on the training for the\nfacility’s approved restraint model, Nonviolent Crisis\nIntervention, as of 12/21/2023.\n• An Incident Report was reviewed dated 05/20/2024\ndescribing the 05/18/2024 incident. The incident report is\nlargely consistent with interviews.\n• Facility policies and procedures titled “Aggressive\nBehavior” and “Assaultive Behavior” were reviewed. These\npolicies outline staff’s preventative and reactive procedures\nin response to escalated behaviors from students. There\nwas no language in the policies that stated that pushing\nwas allowed.\nAnalysis The facility was found in non-compliance as per staff and youth\ninterviews and video review, Staff 1 pushed Youth A multiple\ntimes and threw Youth A to the side during the escalated incident\nthat occurred on 05/18/2024.\nConsultation provided:\nConsultation was provided in the area of best use of staff during\nan escalated incident. This incident involved a restraint attempt\ninitiated by Staff 1 when Staff 1 was directly involved in the\noriginal escalation of Youth A. In addition, staff involved felt that\nStaff 2 would not be able to attempt to de-escalate the situation.\nYouth A may not have been able to benefit from any staff’s de-\nescalation attempts at that point but it should be considered and\nexplored in staff meetings and trainings how staff can avoid\nsituations with youth escalated specifically at them and how other\nstaff can assist in their stead.\nConclusion REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n• SIR 2023C0000338 approved 05/09/2023, CAP approved\n05/23/2023\n• SIR 2024C0000983SI approved 05/22/2024, CAP not yet\napproved\n• SIR 2024C0001074SI approved 03/12/2024, CAP\napproved 04/16/2024\n5",
