    "identify and document additional action needed to secure the parent’s and/or youth’s\nparticipation in service planning and compliance with the PATP. As the goals are\nachieved, modified or expanded, the updated PATP will reflect this process. Parents and\nyouths age 14 and older must participate in the development of each updated treatment\nplan, allowing for opportunity to evaluate their progress towards completing goals.\nNineteen service plans were reviewed. One caregiver PATP and two birth parent\nPATPs were signed more than 30 days after the end of the report period. A corrective\naction plan is required.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not offered technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nDCWL Analyst Report Findings\nThe assigned analyst between 9/4/18 and 9/20/18 visited three foster parents and\nthree unlicensed relatives. Seven foster children were observed. Three birth parents\nwere contacted. The following concerns were reported.\n5",
    "Concern # 1.\nOne parent report they did not sign the service plan. The agency responded that the\nparent refused to sign the service plan. This was documented in the case file and\ncourt record.\nOne parent said she was not involved in the medical decisions concerning her child.\nThe agency responded that reports reflect many efforts to engage the parent\nevidenced by contacts by assigned case managers. The children have been in care\nsince 12/29/16. The goal for her children changed in December 2017. Three of her\nchildren were changed to a goal of full custody with their fathers. One child’s goal\nwas changed to adoption at this time. One child was removed from her 1/22/18 and\ntwo other children were removed 3/16/18. At removal from the fathers, the goal was\nchanged to guardianship. Two previous complaints of similar nature were received\nby the agency from the mother, but it was found there was no evidence to support\nher concerns.\nOne parent said she was not invited to medical appointments, school meetings or\nemergencies involving her child. The agency responded, this complaint was\nreceived by the department from the parent in the summer of 2018 after her parental\nrights were terminated/goal changed. The assigned case manager reports that the\nparent never asked for medical information and at that time the goal had been\nchanged. She was provided with all the children’s medical information at the time\nand she again refused to sign. She had refused to sign all medical passports\npreviously as reported by the assigned case manager. There are contacts in\nJanuary and February 2017 that indicate attempts to complete the medical passport.\nThe parent has never requested to be at medical appointments or get information\nfrom school but was made aware of them. The supervisor when the complaint was\nreceived had a conversation with the parent instructing her that she can call the\nschool or medical provider at any time to get information. She has not done this. The\nparent is present at FTMs and all hearings and it was not a voiced concern until after\nher rights were terminated/goal changed.\nOne parent said she is not involved in decisions regarding the physical appearance\nof her child. The agency responded the parent has signed for ear piercing for one of\nthe girls. The fathers are involved with the children have provided approvals for\nhaircuts. The birth mother has not previously expressed this complaint.\nOne parent said the foster care does only visited her home one time since 2017. The\nagency responded the assigned case manager documented efforts to go to the\nhome and the mother would not answer the door. Another case manager went to the\nhome in March 2018 and was able to see the parent in her home. The goal changed\nso there was not longer the requirement to visit in her home.\nOne parent said she is not offered weekly visitation. Visits are scheduled every two\nweeks.\nConcern #2\n6",
    "There were no concerns reported.\nConcern #3\nOne parent does not feel supported or respected by the foster care worker. The\nagency responded that the analyst visited with the bio parents on 9/13/18. The goal\nwas changed to adoption and parental rights were terminated on 9/12/18. That\nwould be a difficult time for the parents and it would be reasonable for them to feel\nthis way at the time. Reports throughout the time the case was in reunification\nstatus document efforts to reduce the barriers and reunify the family.\nConcern #4\nThe relative care giver was not offered the option of becoming licensed. The agency\nresponded that the children were placed in the relative home on 8/6/18. The date of\nthe analyst visit was 9/6/18. The 3130A was also completed on 9/6/18. They were\nreferred for licensure 9/19/18 and a private agency is currently working with the\nfamily on the licensing process.\nConcern #5\nOne foster parent said the foster care worker does not make unannounced visits.\nThe agency responded unannounced home visits were done on 5/1/18, 8/10/18 and\n9/20/18.\nOne foster parent said a foster child does not have month sib visits. The agency\nresponded the child does not have any siblings.\nConcern #6\nOne relative caregiver was not made aware of financial assistance. The agency\nresponded the caregiver did sign the DHS-972 on 6/8/18 with CPS for placement\nand a licensing worker talked with her to complete the 3130A on 7/3/18 and 7/18/18\nto review the finances as well as benefits available to her in becoming licensed.\nOne relative caregiver did not sign the service plan. The agency responded the\ncaregiver signed the PATP on 8/9/18 and 10/23/18.\nOne relative caregiver is not notified of FTMs. The agency responded that the\ncaregiver was in attendance at the FTM on 9/28/18, which was after her meeting\nwith DCWL on 9/20/18. The only other FTM was the removal FTM that CPS would\nhave held on 6/14/18. It did not appear the caregiver was in attendance for that\nmeeting.\nOne parent said he did not sign the service plan or participate in its development.\nThe agency responded that the parent has a traumatic brain injury and lives with his\n7",
    "mother the caregiver. The parent attends several group therapies throughout the\nweek that help integrate him into the community. He is unable to care for his child\nindependently and requires a caregiver himself, which is why he lives with his\nmother. He functions at about the level of a 4-year-old. He did not attend the FTMs\nand this likely the reasoning.\nOne parent said he has not participated in any FTMs. The agency responded with\nthe above comments.\nThe annual review was completed on 10/31/17. The following rule, policy and\nISEP violations were issued.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(1) An agency shall develop service plans with the child,\nthe child's parents or legal guardian, the referring agency,\nand the other parties involved in providing needed\nservices, or medical care, unless the agency documents\nwhy any of the entities have not been involved.\nSeventeen service plans were reviewed. One youth over 14\nyears did not sign the PATP.\nThe 2018 renewal inspection found two birth parents signed\ntheir PATP more than 30 days after the end of the report period.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(5) An agency shall involve the foster parents in the\ndevelopment of service plans to enable the foster parents\nto understand the plan for the child and the foster parent's\nrole in assisting the agency in carrying out the plan.\nSeventeen service plans were reviewed. Five care givers signed\nthe PATP more than one month after the end of the service plan\nperiod. Four care givers did not sign the PATP.\nThe 2018 renewal inspection found one foster parent signed\ntheir PATP more than 30 days after the end of the report\nperiod..\n8",
    "ISEP 4.22 MiSACWIS (Commitment 22). DHHS will maintain an operational\nstatewide automated child welfare information system (“MiSACWIS”) which\nwill be the primary tracking system and satisfy federal reporting\nrequirements.\nThis consultant found nine documents that should have been uploaded into\nMiSACWIS across six foster care cases during the early part of the review period.\nThe agency was able to upload all required documents into MiSACWIS for second\nhalf of the review period.\nThe 2018 renewal inspection found six documents not uploaded into MiSACWIS.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective\naction plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular\nlicense.\n________________________________________1/14/19\nJames B.
