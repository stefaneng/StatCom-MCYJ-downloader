There are concerns\nthat Youth A is not being protected.\nINVESTIGATION:\nAdministrator was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on March 22.2022 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported being aware of the situation and\n2",
    "having a safety plan in place for both Youth A and Youth B because of past\nconfrontations between them. Currently, the facility has issued a 30-day removal\nletter for Youth B because of her violent behaviors toward peers and staff. Today,\nthe facility has issued a 24-hour removal letter because of the violent behavior of\nYouth B. Youth A is lodged in a different unit at the facility as part of her safety plan\nand Youth B’s bedroom was moved to another hallway in the facility so she is away\nfrom peers.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on March 22.2022 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported the incident described in the\nallegations began on Sunday, March 20, 2022 in the kitchen area in the facility.\nYouth A was completing her chores while waiting for Youth B to return to the area.\nUpon her return, Youth B informed Youth A that she needed to \"get out\" of the\nkitchen and Youth A replied, \"I was here first\". Youth B \"told the staff to tell\" Youth A\nto leave the area before \"talking about Youth A's mother\". Youth A responded by\nasking her what she said before leaving the area and going into the television room.\nYouth A also reported Youth B followed her into the television room and pulled a\ncord from the back of the television. Youth B then struck her with the cord before\nYouth A began hitting and kicking her back. Youth A believed Youth B when she\nsaid she would kill her because Youth B had attacked her in the past. \"Staff took a\nlong time to respond\" and once responding, Youth B was able to break free from the\nrestraint. Both youth began to fight again, until staff were able to get Youth B away\nfrom Youth A. Youth A identified Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 as the staff that\nintervened in the incident. Youth A reported having a bruise on her leg and\nAdministrator provided a picture of a large, long mark on Youth A's leg that appeared\nto be caused by the cord, confirming her allegation. Youth A reported not feeling\nsafe at the facility because Youth B is always fighting other youth and threatening\nher. Youth A did state staff are always intervening when Youth B is attacking her or\nothers. Youth A has Therapist as a support person but also believes Therapist is not\ndoing anything to stop the attacks because she is always placed back with Youth B.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on March 22.2022 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported getting into a fight with Youth A\nlast Sunday (March 20, 2022) but was unable to identify the cause of the fight. She\nreported she doesn’t remember what happened. Youth B described the incident,\n\"we were hitting and kicking each other with extension cords before the staff took\nthe cords away from us\". Youth B reported staff are quick to respond to any fighting\nfrom youth and will process with the youth what occurred. She believed a safety\nplan was put into place because Youth A was moved to a different unit. She stated\nshe feels safe being on the unit and has no concerns about the facility.\nNurse was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on March 22.2022 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported observing Youth A on Monday\n(March 21, 2022) and the only concerns presented by Youth A was her back was\nbothering her. Nurse observed her later in the day and she appeared to be walking\nnormally. She also reported observing Youth B the same day and Youth B\n3",
    "minimized the incident with Youth A. Youth B informed Nurse \"I got hit with a cord\nwhen I was little, so I hit her with a cord\". Youth B had no medical issues or\nconcerns.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on March 22.2022 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported being the primary therapist for\nboth Youth A and Youth B. Both youth shared their version of the incident which\nmatched what Youth A reported during her interview. According to Youth A she\nbegan to fight back while Youth B was in a restraint after being hit by Youth B with\nthe cord. Therapist also reported conducting individual therapy sessions with each\nyouth weekly and observing them daily at times. She believes Youth B will be\nreplaced on Friday (March 25, 2022).\nStaff 1 was interviewed via TEAMS, on 3/25/2022 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. She reports working at the facility as a \"Youth Treatment Specialist\" and\nbeing present during the incident outlined in the allegations. She recalled the\nincident taking place during chore time and Youth B becoming upset after Youth A\nmade an unknown gesture towards her. Youth A went into a smaller room to read a\nbook and Youth B began swearing at her. After asking why Youth B was upset,\nYouth B responded with \"I'm sick of these motherfuckers and I'm going to beat her\nlike her mother beat her\". Staff 1 attempted to deescalate Youth B just before Youth\nB went into the room with the television and pulled the HDMI cable from the back of\nthe television. Youth A was sitting on the couch in front of the television when this\naction by Youth B occurred. Staff 1 overheard Staff 3 tell Youth B “no”, just before\nStaff 3 tried to deescalate Youth B.

Staff 1 reported\nbeing able to get Youth A away from Youth B and taking her into the office, shutting\nthe door behind them. While trying to deescalate Youth A, Youth B was \"ramming\"\nher body into the staff room door to break in and get at Youth A again. As Another\nstaff (who was in the bathroom during the incident) came into the staff office, Youth\nB rushed the door and entered the room and tried to attack Youth A again. Once\nYouth B was removed from the room, she began to flip furniture in the living area.\nSupervisor came into the space and tried to calm Youth B down. Once Youth B was\nremoved from the unit, Staff 1 came out of the office with Youth A. Staff 1 reported\nbeing aware of the history between Youth A and Youth B and being aware of the\nsafety plan in place. This was the reason staff were keeping the Youth separated.\nThis was occurring when they would only allow one of the two youth in the kitchen\nor in a specific space at a time. A follow up telephone interview with Staff 1 was\ncompleted on 4/05/2022. She reported the incident did not involve a restraint of\nYouth B because staff were just trying to pull them apart.

Staff 2 reported all of a sudden Youth B came into\nthe room, grabbed the HDMI cable from the television and moved towards Youth A.\nStaff 2 stepped in between Youth A and Youth B to keep Youth B from getting to\nYouth A. Youth B swung the cable around Staff 2 and hit Youth A. Staff 2 stayed\nbetween the two youth until Staff 1 removed Youth A to the office. Once this\noccurred, Staff 2 took the other youth in the unit down to their rooms so Youth B\nhad no other youth around her that she could attack. Staff 2 reported Youth B tried\nand finally got into the office. Supervisor came on the unit and helped deescalate\nYouth B. Staff 2 reported the safety plans are in place and posted in the office. Staff\nare also informed of safety plans during team meetings. A follow up telephone call\nwith Staff 2 was completed on 4/05/2022. She denied staff used any restraint\ntechniques with Youth B and were only trying to separate the two youth.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via TEAMS, on 3/25/2022 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. She reported working at the facility as a \"Youth Treatment Specialist\" and\narriving for her shift when the incident occurred.

Upon his arrival, he found Staff 1\nand Youth A in the office and Youth B trying to break into the office. He made\nefforts to deescalate Youth B and was able to plan with the other staff to get Youth\nB off the unit.
