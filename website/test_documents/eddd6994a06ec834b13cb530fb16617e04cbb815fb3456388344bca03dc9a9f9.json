    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404 Placement\nSection • (2) Initial consideration must be given to placement with a\nDescription relative or placing siblings together, or both.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There are concerns that relative placements were not explored.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nParent A was interviewed by phone on 5/23/2025. Parent A\nexpressed concern regarding her daughter’s current placement\nand agency staff’s failure to place Youth A with a relative. Parent\nA’s statements were, at times, disjointed and attempts to seek\nclarification were unsuccessful. She stated Youth A accused\nParent A of physically abusing her after which Youth A ran away.\nWhen Youth A was located, MDHHS placed Youth A with her\nfather. Youth A kept running away from her father’s home to\nCaregiver A’s home, during that time. Parent A stated MDHHS\nremoved Youth A from her father’s care at which time she was\nplaced with Caregiver A. She stated Caregiver A is an unlicensed\nfoster parent who they are referring to as fictive kin; however,\nParent A does not know the family. She initially stated Youth A\nwas having sex with Caregiver A’s brother, then later stated she\ndid not know how Youth A knows Caregiver A. At a different point\nin the interview, she stated Caregiver A is Youth A’s boyfriend’s\nsister, but later stated Youth A did not have a boyfriend as she\nwas not allowed to “do anything out of the will of God,” and Youth\nA could not spend time with anyone Parent A had not met. Parent\nA also stated Caregiver A lived in the same apartment complex as\nParent A and Youth A, but they did not know one another.\nParent A reported Youth A has adult siblings with whom she could\nlive, but the agency has not pursued those options. Parent A\nstated Sibling 1, who lives in Texas, expressed interest in\nplacement of Youth A so the Judge ordered that Interstate\nCompact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) become involved.\nParent A reported the agency staff lied and said Sibling 1 became\nhomeless, so ICPC closed the case. Parent A stated the agency\ncontacted Sibling 2 for placement of Youth A , but Youth A said\nshe didn’t want to go to any of her siblings’ homes. Parent A\nstated she believed Youth A thinks her siblings are mad because\nParent A went to jail and has a criminal case pending for allegedly\nabusing Youth A, which Parent A denies doing. Parent A stated\nSibling 3 was living with Parent A and has an MDHHS case open,\nso she wasn’t a placement option and Sibling 4 is in jail. She did\n2",
    "not mention any other siblings. During this interview, Parent A\nstated multiple times that Youth A talks with her siblings and has\ntold them she wants to stay with Caregiver A and does not want to\nlive with her siblings or Parent A. Parent A ended the placement\ndiscussion by stating the agency staff have never searched for a\nfamily placement.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via video conferencing on\n5/30/2025. She reported not working for the agency when the\ncase first came into care, but she knows agency staff made efforts\nthrough ICPC to locate relative placement with Sibling 1 in Texas;\nhowever, Sibling 1 became homeless so Youth A could not be\nplaced with her. Program Manager did not know any details about\nthe other siblings, but remembered none of them were appropriate\nfor placement. Program Manager stated Youth A is placed with\nher ex-boyfriend’s sister, who is considered fictive kin.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing\non 6/3/2025. She reported Youth A’s case was assigned to the\nagency on 12/8/2023. She stated, at the onset of the case, the\ngoal was reunification with an order to pursue placement with\nSibling 1 in Texas through ICPC. Foster Care Supervisor attended\ncourt in May of 2024 at which time Parent A’s attorney reported to\nthe court that Sibling 1 had become homeless. In June or July of\n2024, the court changed the goal from reunification to epic\nguardianship with Caregiver A. Foster Care Supervisor stated it\nhas been difficult to get contact information for any relatives as,\nwhenever she was asked, Parent A would state they didn’t have\nany relatives. Parent A told Foster Care Supervisor that Sibling 2\nis sick, Sibling 3 was living with Parent A until they became\nhomeless, Sibling 4 was in jail, and another of Youth A’s sisters\nwas living out of the country. Foster Care Supervisor stated she\ncontacted Sibling 1 who reported she was willing to take\nplacement of Youth A only if Youth A wanted to live with her. She\nalso had contact with Sibling 2 who stated she did not want Youth\nA to live with her unless Youth A wanted to. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated Youth A remained in contact with her siblings\nthroughout the case but expressed her desire to live with\nCaregiver A and not her siblings. Foster Care Supervisor stated\nthe goal changed from reunification to epic guardianship, but\nParent A opposed the guardianship, so the goal was changed to\nAnother Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA.) Parent\nA did not want the goal of APPLA; however, that remains the\ncurrent goal.\n3",
    "Foster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on 6/18/2025.\nShe stated Youth A recently provided her with a list of siblings\nwhich included Sibling 1 who lives in Texas, Sibling 2 who was\nliving with Parent A and is “sick“ which Foster Care Worker\nbelieved had something to with her organs, Sibling 3 with whom\nYouth A reported having “burned bridges,” Sibling 4 who is\nincarcerated, Sibling 5 who lives in Texas, Sibling 6 who in in the\nAirforce and living in Italy, and Sibling 7 who lives in Ghana. Youth\nA has told Foster Care Worker and the court on multiple\noccasions that she does not want to live with any of her siblings.\nFoster Care Worker stated the initial goal was reunification and to\npursue placement with Sibling 1; however, it was changed to\nguardianship with Caregiver A, then APPLA with Caregiver A.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nCourt Orders\n• 11/7/23 - Youth A remain in current placement, Youth A\ncannot move to Texas pending disposition in Parent A’s\ncriminal matter involving Youth A as the victim.\n• 2/6/2024 – DHHS to file ICPC request for placement in\nTexas.\n• 5/22/2024 – ICPC pending with MDHHS.\n• 7/16/2024 – Youth A continue in current placement who\nmay file for epic guardianship.\n• 9/17/2024 – Goal changed to guardianship with Youth A’s\ncurrent placement.\n• 12/17/2024 – Placement not addressed.\n• 3/25/2025 – Goal Change to APPLA.\n• 6/20/2025 – Reasonable efforts were made toward relative\nplacement, Permanency goal is APPLA.\n5/22/24 Letter from Youth A stating she:\n• does not want to leave her current school or placement.\n• does not want to go to Texas until after she finishes high\nschool.\n• wants to stay with Caregiver A until after she graduates.\nScreenshot of text from Youth A to Foster Care Worker with\nthe following list of her siblings’ locations:\n• Sibling 1 –Texas\n• Sibling 2 – Flint, Sick\n• Sibling 3 – Flint, specific location unknown\n• Sibling 4 – Jail\n4",
    "• Sibling 5 – Texas\n• Sibling 6 – Italy\n• Sibling 7 – Ghana\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as Youth A has expressed her\ndesire to live with her current caregiver and to not live with any of\nher siblings. Agency staff discussed placement with two of Youth\nA’s siblings who both expressed they would only take placement\nof Youth A if Youth A wanted to live with them. The permanency\ngoal has been either guardianship or APPLA for the past year,\nnegating the need to pursue relative placement. Additionally, the\ncourt made a finding that the agency made reasonable effort\ntoward locating relative placement.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12419 Initial service plans\nSection • (1) The initial service plan, as required in R\nDescription 400.12418(2)(a), must include all the following information:\n• (e) A plan that has as its goal reunification of the\nchild with his or her family or another goal of\npermanent placement. The plan shall include all the\nfollowing information:\n• (i) The permanency goal for the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There are concerns that reunification was not appropriately\nexplored.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nParent A was interviewed by phone on 5/23/2025 and 5/28/2025.\nShe was largely focused on what she stated is a “false case”\nagainst her and the federal lawsuit she is pursuing against all\nparties involved, which made it difficult to attain needed\ninformation. She stated the assigned foster care agency staff have\nnever given her a chance, have lied, and have falsified\ndocuments. She stated she has never been provided with any\nservice referrals and had to find service providers on her own. She\nstated she has completed everything on her service plan, but they\nkeep changing the goal; reporting the goal was initially\nreunification, then it was changed to guardianship, and now it has\nbeen changed to APPLA. She later stated she initially agreed to\nguardianship as the goal because Youth A’s behaviors got to be\ntoo much for her. When asked if she had spoken to her attorney\n5",
    "about the goal changes, she stated she has fired several\nattorneys and is representing herself. She reported Youth A’s\nattorney is “awful” and has tried to terminate Parent A’s rights.\nParent A stated the agency has put a no contact order in place so\nshe can only communicate with them through email. When asked\nfor clarification regarding the no contact order, she stated the\nagency staff have not responded to her text messages, phone\ncalls, or emails for months; however, this contradicted several\nstatements she made about her recent contact with the worker\nand supervisor. She then stated she was told by agency staff\nyesterday she can only communicate with them via email.\nThroughout the interview, Parent A repeated agency staff have\ntold all of her service providers and Youth A’s school that Parent\nA’s rights are terminated, so they will not provide her services or\nany documentation she requests.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via video conferencing on\n5/30/2025. She stated the goal of the case was changed from\nreunification to guardianship at which point the agency staff\ntypically do not provide services to parents, but the judge on this\ncase continues to order services be provided, so the assigned\nfoster care worker continues to assist Parent A with services. She\nstated, at one point, the court ordered all communication with\nParent A occur via email, which it does. She stated the agency\ncontinues to work with Parent A; however, Parent A is threatening\ntoward agency staff and service providers, so there is currently a\nplan being developed with MDHHS as to how to proceed with the\ncase in order to keep everyone safe. Program Manager denied\never telling anyone Parent A’s rights have been terminated.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing\non 6/3/2025. She stated, when the agency accepted Youth A’s\ncase in December of 2023, the goal was reunification, and all\ncommunication occurred through Parent A’s attorney. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated the case was not adjudicated until September of\n2024 at which time the goal was guardianship; however, agency\nstaff had been providing services to Parent A since case\nacceptance. She reported Parent A was provided with housing\nreferrals/resources, bus passes, and parent education referral and\nservice. She stated Parent A has been homeless throughout most\nof the case and has moved between Saginaw, Detroit, and Flint,\nwhich the agency has provided resources and services for all\nlocations. Foster Care Supervisor stated Parent A also has a\ncriminal case for which she was ordered to complete conflict\nresolution, anger management, and psychological evaluation.\n6",
    "Foster Care Supervisor reported Parent A has completed all court\nordered services.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on 6/18/2025.\nFoster Care Worker stated she has provided Parent A with\nreferrals to the parent partner program, mental health providers,\nand has provided housing and transportation\nassistance/resources. She stated reunification has not been the\ngoal since last April. Foster Care Worker reported there was a\ncourt hearing the same day as the interview during which Parent A\nstated she does not want Youth A and called Youth A a liar.\nFoster Care Worker stated all services for Parent A were\nsuspended during the hearing and the goal remains APPLA.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nCase Contacts\n• 3/13/2024 – Email from Foster Care Supervisor to Parent A\nand Parent A’s attorney with a list of service providers for\nparent education, anger management, and conflict\nresolution\n• 11/25/2024 – Email from Foster Care Worker to Parent A\nand Parent A’s attorney with list of service providers in\nDetroit for parent education, anger management, and\nconflict resolution as Parent A moved to a homeless shelter\nin Detroit\n• 1/2/2025 – Email from Foster Care Worker to Parent A with\nhousing resource referrals in Flint as Parent A had\nrelocated to that area\n• 1/6/2025 – Email to Parent A from Foster Care Worker to\nParent A with anger management resources\n• 2/10/2025 – Email to Parent A from Foster Care Worker\nwith referral to conflict resolution class\n• 4/7/2025 – Phone call between Foster Care Supervisor and\nParent A during which Foster Care Worker reported to\nParent A\n• 4/30/2025 – Phone call from Foster Care Worker to Parent\nA to inform her of family therapy arrangement, voicemail\nleft\n• 5/2/2025 – Phone call to Foster Care Worker from Parent\nA.

Goal changed\nto APPLA.\n• 6/20/2025 – Reasonable efforts were made toward\npermanency goal, Parent A no longer required to engage in\nservices with the agency.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as, at the time the agency\naccepted case responsibility, they provided referrals to Parent A\ndespite her not having been adjudicated. When Parent A was\nadjudicated, the permanency goal was changed to guardianship\nafter which the agency continued to provide services. Currently,\nthe goal is APPLA and Parent A no longer has to be provided with\nservices. Additionally, the court found that the agency provided\nreasonable efforts toward the goal during every court hearing\nsince Parent A was adjudicated.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and family time; in person\nSection contact\nDescription • (4) An agency shall facilitate in-person contact between\nsiblings who are not placed together except when there is a\ncourt determination that contact is detrimental to either\nchild.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Parenting time visits have not adequately been offered.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\n8",
    "Parent A was interviewed by phone on 5/23/2025. She reported\nshe has only had one face to face contact with Youth A in 2 years.\nShe was unable to provide a clear explanation as to why this was\nthe case as she, at times, stated the judge ordered no contact, but\nat other times during the conversation stated the agency was\nrefusing to facilitate parenting time or that Youth A did not want to\nvisit with Parent A. She stated she and Youth A were in\ncounseling for three weeks before the court ordered there be no\ncontact between them. She stated this was based on lies the\nGuardian Ad Litem told the court. She stated Youth A called her\non Mother’s Day this year for the first time in 2 years. Parent A\nstated the court has now ordered that parenting time and\ncounseling occur, but there have not yet been any parenting\ntimes.\nOn 5/28/2025 Parent A called and stated her daughter was\nsupposed to attend counseling with her on Tuesday via Zoom, but\nher daughter jumped onto the meeting then left, stating she had to\nattend a graduation. Parent A stated she didn’t understand this\nbecause Youth A is not graduating. Parent A was then asked if the\nZoom counseling was supposed to be parenting time. Parent A\nresponded that the judge ordered counseling in a therapeutic\nsetting, but parenting time was supposed to be supervised which\nthe agency was not making happen. Parent A then read her court\norder aloud, which stated parenting time was to occur in a\ntherapeutic session. Parent A quickly ended the call so she could\nfollow up with her therapist.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing\non 6/3/2025. She reported the agency took over case\nmanagement responsibility for Youth A on 12/8/2023. She stated\nshe was the assigned foster care worker until April, when she\nbegan supervising Foster Care Worker to whom the case was\nreassigned. She stated, when the agency took over case\nmanagement, parenting time between Youth A and Parent A was\nordered to take place with the family’s therapist via Telehealth;\nhowever, the court suspended parenting time at the 5/22/2024\nhearing due to Parent A’s behavior during parenting time. At that\nsame hearing, the judge ordered no contact between Youth A and\nParent A because mom had sent threatening texts to Youth A.\nFoster Care Supervisor reported visits were ordered to resume in\na therapeutic setting in March of 2025. She stated there have\nbeen a few virtual visit attempts since; one visit was cut short due\nto Youth A leaving the visit to attend a graduation event, and the\nmost recent visit did not take place due to Parent A not showing\nup.\n9",
    "Foster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on 6/18/2025.\nShe stated there has been no parenting time allowed in person\nsince she was assigned the case in April of 2024 due to the court\nhaving ordered no contact between Youth A and Parent A as the\nresult of Parent A engaging in witness tampering related to her\ncriminal case. Foster Care Worker stated, at the 3/25/25 hearing,\nvirtual visits in a therapeutic setting were ordered. Since that time,\nthere have been three visit attempts. Foster Care Worker stated\nthe therapist told her Parent A and Youth A attended the first visit,\nwhich was “very explosive.” Youth A showed up to the second\nvisit, but Parent A did not. Youth A showed up in a timely manner\nto the third visit, but Parent A was having difficulty with her\nconnection. She did eventually join, but Youth A had left after 15\nminutes to attend a graduation event. Foster Care Worker stated\nthe therapist provided a written report to the court recommending\nthe family therapy and visits be suspended. Foster Care Worker\nstated there was a hearing earlier in the day during which the\ncourt ordered contact between Youth A and Parent A be at Youth\nA’s discretion.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nCourt Orders\n• 11/7/23 - Parenting time supervised, only in therapeutic\nsetting by Zoom until Parent A’s hospital release.\n• 2/6/2024 – Parenting time supervised in therapeutic setting\nto continue with MDHHS discretion to expand to face to\nface visits.\n• 5/22/2024 – Parenting time suspended, family therapy\ndiscontinued due to alleged disrupted behavior by Parent\nA, No contact between Parent A and Youth A.\n• 7/16/2024 – Parenting time suspended.\n• 9/4/2024 – Parenting time suspended.\n• 9/17/2024 – Parenting time supervised in therapeutic\nsetting.\n• 12/17/2024 – In best interest of Youth A to suspend contact\nwith Parent A.\n• 3/25/2025 –Parenting time supervised in a therapeutic\nsetting at the recommendation of the therapist.\n• 6/20/2025 – Communication with Parent A is at Youth A’s\ndiscretion.\nSocial Work Contacts\n10",
