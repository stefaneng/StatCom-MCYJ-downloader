    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff gave youth edible and was transported to hospital due to\nreaction.\nInvestigation On 6/28/23, I spoke to Administrator 1 via telephone.\nAdministrator 1 reported that Youth A and Youth B went to the\nhospital after taking a marihuana edible. Administrator 1 reported\nthere were four staff on the unit at that time. Three of the staff\nhave been placed on administrative leave. Administrator 1\nbelieves that Staff 4 gave Youth 1 the edible but Staff 2 and 3\nwere aware of the exchange. Administrator 1 reported she does\nhave video footage showing Staff 4 giving Youth A a book with\nsomething inside of it.\nComplainant 1 was contacted on 6/28/23 and provided no further\ninformation.\nOn 6/30/23, I completed the following interviews at the\nfacility:\nAdministrator 1 reported that Staff 4 provided Youth A with a\nbook. Staff 4 did not have approval to give Youth A the book\nmaking the transaction suspicious because it is the agency’s\npractice that books cannot be given to youth with approval.\nAdministrator 1 reported that when she discussed the incident with\nStaff 2, Staff 2 lied about the incident at first then acknowledged\nStaff 4 brought the edible in and provided it to the Youth A in the\nbook. Administrator 1 reported that Youth A and Youth B ate the\nedible and were throwing up. Administrator 1 reported that Nurse\n1 checked on both youth and advised the agency to take them to\nthe hospital. Administrator 1 reported both youths went to the\nhospital and Youth A refused to take the urine test. Youth B had\ncannabinoids in his system.\nStaff 1 reported she was assigned to the POD and Staff 3 was\nworking as well. Staff 4 came into the POD and handed Staff 3 a\nbook and then Staff 3 gave the book to Youth A. Staff 1 reported\nthat staff are not allowed to give youth items and Staff 4 should\nnot have given Youth A the book. Staff 1 reported there was\n2",
    "something in the book and it was not a bookmark. Staff 1 reported\nthe book was halfway open because of the item in the book. Staff\n1 reported she left the POD at 2:00pm and was told that the youth\nwere sick later in the evening. Staff 1 then reported to Nurse 1\nwhat had happened earlier in the day with the book. Staff 1\nreported that Staff 4 is too friendly with the youth. Staff 1 reported\nthat Staff 3 was aware of what was in the book and didn’t say\nanything.\nYouth B reported he did receive the edible from staff. Youth A\nwould not report which staff did this. Youth A reported he ate the\nedible around 1:45pm. Youth A reported around 3:00pm he was\nfeeling “weird” and couldn’t talk or walk normal. At 4:00pm they\nwent to dinner and then he went to the hospital.\nYouth A reported he took an edible, threw up and then Nurse 1\nsaw him and sent him to the hospital. Youth A would not report\nwho provided him with the edible.\nStaff 2 reported she was completing her rounds and was asked to\nprovide breaks to the staff on the POD. Staff 2 reported that she\ndid not see a book passed between staff and youth. Staff 2\nreported she did not tell Administrator 1 that she saw them\npassing a book. Staff 2 reported that she heard from Staff 3 there\nwas something in a book that Staff 4 gave to Youth A.\nStaff 3 reported he was working on the POD when Staff 4 came\ninto the POD and gave him a book. He held onto it and then gave\nit back to Staff 4. Staff 4 then gave Youth A the book. Staff 3\ninitially reported he didn’t feel anything the book yet disclosed to\nDHHS Worker 1 that there was “candy” in it. Staff 3 reported he\ndidn’t say anything to anyone about the candy because he didn’t\n“want anything to do with it.”\nStaff 4 reported he was not supposed to be in the unit that he\nwent into the POD. Staff 4 reported he was assigned in a different\narea but had a book for Youth A. Staff 4 reported he did not get\napproval for the book. Staff 4 reported that he did not give Youth A\nanything else but the book.\nYouth B documentation:\nI reviewed the Incident Report dated 6/27/23 at 4:45pm.\nDocument reports Youth B vomited on the floor and was seen by\nNurse 1 and then sent out to Detroit Receiving Hospital. He was\ndiagnosed with marihuana usage.\n3",
    "I reviewed the Detroit Receiving Hospital medical document for\nYouth B. Youth B was positive for cannabinoids.\nYouth A documentation:\nI reviewed the Incident Report dated 6/27/23 at 5:15pm. Youth A\nwas nauseous and vomiting and transported to Nurse 1 then to\nDetroit Receiving Hospital. It was noted that he had an “altered\nmental status.”\nI reviewed the Detroit Receiving Hospital document for Youth A.\nHe was diagnosed for “altered mental status”. Youth A refused a\nurine test.\nI reviewed the Professional Boundaries: Employee\nRelationships with Youth Policy:\n• “…a professional relationship implies that the relationship\ndoes not extend outside professional duties and that all\nplanned interactions between staff and youth only occur\nduring the course of work and are authorized by the\ntreatment or service plan, and or agency procedures…”\n• “Examples of Unprofessional Boundaries: buying and/or\ngiving gifts to youth that are unauthorized or outside the\nscope of the program”.\n• “…if an employee witnesses another employee behaving in\na manner that is contradictory to a professional relationship\nand/or could be potentially detrimental to a youth, the\nwitness employee has a responsibility to report the\nsuspected behavior/relationship to the Program Director…”\nStaff 3 was provided the following training:\nTreatment overview, Policies and Procedures, Crisis Intervention,\nProfessional Boundaries (5/8/23)\nStaff 2 was provided the following training:\nOrientation/policies and procedures, Treatment Overview, Policies\nand Procedures, Professional Boundaries,\nAnalysis Staff 4 provided Youth A with a book and “candy” when he was\nnot working with Youth A that day. These are outside the planned\ninterventions as noted in the Professional Boundaries Policy.\nAdministrator 1, Staff 1 and Staff 4 all confirmed that Staff 4 did\nnot have permission to give Youth A gifts. The candy that was\nprovided was a marihuana edible that caused nausea, vomiting,\ndisorientation and an “altered mental state” as noted in the\nincident reports and Detroit Receiving Hospital.\n4",
    "Both Staff 2 and Staff 3 reported they knew Staff 4 gave Youth A\nthe marihuana edible but did not report this information to their\ndirect supervisor. Both failed to follow policies and procedure\ndesigned to protect youth as required by this rule.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to\nSection requirement: staff qualifications.\nDescription (1) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(b) A check of Michigan’s child abuse and neglect central\nregistry or Canadian provincial agency referenced in R\n400.4113(i)\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 4 provided Youth A with an edible marihuana candy and\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 did not report this to supervision.\nInvestigation DHHS Worker 1 reported findings.\nStaff 4 was provided the following training:\nYouth Worker Treatment Functions, Crisis Intervention, Discipline\nTechniques\nBoth Staff 2 and Staff 3 reported they knew Staff 4 gave Youth A\nthe marihuana edible but did not report this information to their\ndirect supervisor.\nAnalysis Staff 4 was provided training to perform the duties outlined for a\ndirect care worker and did not fulfill that role.\nStaff 2 and 3 both reported they knew about the marihuana edible\nand did not report this to their supervisor. They have been trained\non the policies and procedures which discuss how to intervene\nwhen witnessing suspect behavior. They failed to follow policy.\nAlthough trained on policy they do not have the ability to perform\nthe duties outlines. Another department in the state had findings\naround this investigation.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
