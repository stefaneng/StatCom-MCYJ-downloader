    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth R alleged Staff 1 & Staff 2 attempted to fight her on 5/17/24.\nYouth R has a scratch on her wrist.\nInvestigation Video:\nAccording to Complainant, Youth R said the alleged incident\noccurred in bedroom 4 on 5/17/24 between 10:09pm – 10:12pm.\nThere are no video cameras in the youths’ bedrooms, and nothing\nwas seen on the footage reviewed.\nInterviews\nI notified Complainant of this investigation assignment in person\non 5/22/24. She said Youth R showed her a 1” superficial scratch\non her wrist and told her Staff 1 and Staff 2 tried to fight her. If\nthis happened, Complainant said it would be out of character for\nStaff 1 and Staff 2.\nI notified Youth R’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation, and\nshe expressed no additional concerns.\nI interviewed Youth R jointly with Government Worker on 5/22/24.\nShe claimed she did not know anything about the alleged incident.\n“I’m not talking to CPS. This is triggering me. Fuck. Shit. No.”\nYouth R walked out of the interview room before we could observe\nthe abrasion.\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker on\n5/22/24. She said she was on Youth R’s wing and left for a few\nminutes. When she returned, Youth R showed her a scratch on\nher left wrist and said she got it from Staff 1 and Staff 2 who had\nfought her in room 4 while Supervisor was off the wing.\n2",
    "Supervisor did not witness Staff 1 or Staff 2 fighting Youth R. She\nsaid Youth R had destroyed property, assaulted staff and was\nphysically managed in the preceding 90 minutes so could have\nscratched herself or been accidentally scratched by another\nperson in the process. Supervisor said she completed a body\nchart and administered first aid to the abrasion on Youth R’s wrist.\nLater that evening on-call Government Worker 2 arrived and\ndirected Supervisor to have Youth R taken out for medical\ntreatment. Supervisor arranged for Youth R to be transported to\nthe emergency room for additional treatment for the abrasion.\nI interviewed Youth J jointly with Government Worker on 5/22/24.\nShe said she told Youth R to “shut the fuck up or I’d kick her ass.”\nIn the hallway Youth J said she saw Youth R kicking the wall and\nhitting Staff 1 and Staff 2 on various parts of their bodies. “They\n(Staff 1 and Staff 2) let her hit them. I got mad so I started hitting\nYouth R…Staff 1 and Staff 2 did not hit Youth R. I don’t know why\nshe says that. The police came and Youth R calmed down.”\nI interviewed Youth A jointly with Government Worker on 5/22/24.\nShe denied witnessing anything on 5/17/24 related to Youth R,\nStaff 1 and Staff 2.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker on 5/22/24.\nShe is a case manager but assumed the role as direct care staff\non 5/17/24. Ninety minutes prior to the alleged incident, Staff 1\nsaid Youth R refused to step in her room for her safety as\ndirected. “She kicked, punched, picked holes in and was covered\nin drywall. She kicked a male staff and fell on the ground. Youth\nR pulled insulation out of the wall and threw it in our faces. She\nflashed her private parts to Staff 2 and used profanity. Supervisor\nand Staff 2 cleared out Youth R's room for her safety. Youth R\nbecame loud, banging on doors and unscrewed a bathroom\nmirror. I verbally de-escalated. Youth R stood on a table and\ntried to use the phone without permission. She flicked lights on\nand off and swung the phone at Staff 2. Her peers were getting\nirritated. Youth J and Youth R exchanged words. I blocked them\nto prevent a fight. They got hold of my hair.” Youth R went into\nYouth J’s room and threatened to destroy it. “She threw water in\nthe room and kicked us. We (Staff 1 and Staff 2) attempted to\nrestrain her but were not able to…Police were called to transport\nher to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.”\nStaff 1 denied fighting Youth R and also denied that Staff 2 fought\nher. She insisted, “We followed Vista Maria’s behavior\nmanagement model for de-escalation.”\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker on 5/22/24.\nShe has worked at the facility for two years. Staff 2 said Youth R\ndisplayed dangerous behaviors prior to the alleged incident. “She\nscratched me and tried to bite me. We observed marks on Staff\n2’s right forearm. We separated her from a peer. Youth R ran into\nYouth J’s room and started tearing it up. Staff 1 and I tried to\nblock her from trashing the room. Youth R poured water from a\nwater bottle. We stepped in to get the water bottle and she\nattacked us. We were unable to manage her. She sat down on\nthe floor and then exited Youth J’s room. Youth R showed me a\nscratch on her wrist. At the end of the shift, I found out she\nalleged that me and Staff 1 fought her in Youth J’s room.”\nStaff 2 denied fighting Youth R and also denied that Staff 1 fought\nher.\nDocuments reviewed:\nPhoto of Youth R’s left inner wrist taken by Government Worker 2\non 5/18/24 showing a ½” horizontal abrasion.\nAn incident report by Staff 1 dated 5/17/24 at 10:33pm indicates\n“Youth R entered Youth J’s room… Staff 1 and Staff 2 entered in\nattempts to stop Youth R from destroying Youth J’s things. Youth\nR poured water all over Youth J’s floor, bed, and stuffed animals.\nYouth R began to swing and hit Staff 1 and Staff 2 with a closed\nfist. Staff 1 and Staff 2 attempted to place Youth R in a CPI hold.\nYouth R began to kick Staff 2 and bite then dropped to the floor,\nsitting in between the desk. Staff 1 and Staff 2 continued to offer\nverbal support to Youth R, asking for her to come out of Youth J’s\nroom. Youth R exited the room…”\nEmergency room discharge instructions indicate Youth R was\nseen on 5/18/24 for pain in her right hand after she punched a\nwall. She was not seen for the abrasion on her left wrist that she\nalleged was caused by Staff 1 and Staff 2. Youth R’s right hand\nwas x-rayed, a splint was applied, and she was given Tylenol and\nMotrin. Follow up with an orthopedic surgeon was recommended.\nOn 6/6/24, this case was transferred from Government Worker to\nGovernment Worker 2.\nGovernment Worker 2 had no findings.\nAnalysis There is no evidence Staff 1 and/or Staff 2 physically fought Youth\nR or attempted to fight her. Prior to the alleged incident Youth R\n4",
    "punched a wall and injured her right hand. The abrasion on her\nleft wrist was likely caused by Youth R physically acting out and\ndestroying property.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJune 18, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 21, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n5"
