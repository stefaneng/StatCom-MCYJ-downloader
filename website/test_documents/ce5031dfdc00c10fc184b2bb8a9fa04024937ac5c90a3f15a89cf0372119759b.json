    "ALLEGATION:\nAgency recommended revocation of the foster home license without justification.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 06/02/21, I received an email notification of this complaint indicating the following\nhad been reported to DCWL Area Manager 2,\nI received a complaint from the complainant. She states that Catholic Social\nServices placed kids with the foster parent contrary to what the foster parent put\nas her preference on the 3706. When the foster parent was unable to care for\nthese kids, one of which had to be placed at (a residential facility) and had been\nrestrained 40 times, they eventually moved to revoke her license.\nI interviewed the complainant via phone on 06/14/2021. The complainant reported\nthat she feels the agency placed several children in the foster home that did not fit\nthe placement specifications of the home, and when those children acted out, the\nagency moved to revoke the license and blame the foster parent. The complainant\nidentified Foster Child A, Foster Child B, Foster Child C, Foster Child D, and Foster\nChild E. The complainant said the children were autistic, assaultive, and some of\nthem had eating disorders, walked out of the house, and defecated on the floor. The\ncomplainant also reported that some of the youth were bedwetters and noted that\nthe foster parent did not take bedwetters. The complainant said that the placing\nworkers for Foster Children A and B minimized the kids’ behaviors to get them\nplaced. The complainant said the worker (the Chief Administrator) for Foster\nChildren C, D, and E (a sibling group) did not disclose all of the kids’ behaviors at\nthe disclosure meeting. The complainant said that the Chief Administrator was\npresent at the meeting with the placing workers from another agency. It was then\nclarified that Foster Child A and Foster Child B were placed as borrowed bed\nplacements through another agency and not by Catholic Social Services of\nWashtenaw. The complainant alleged the one of the workers from the other agency\ntold the kids to make complaints against the foster parent and that the foster parent\ncaught the worker in lies when the foster parent recorded conversations. The\ncomplainant reportedly felt that the foster parent would not have had these problems\nif the agency did not put children in the home that were outside the placement\nspecifications. The complainant noted that the foster parent wants to move her\nlicense to another agency.\nMiSACWIS case information was reviewed for the foster home license as well as the\nchildren named in the complaint. The foster home placement specifications indicated\nthat the foster parent would not take youth who smeared stool, were delinquent,\nautistic, encopretic, were sexually aggressive, or were LGBTQ. Placement\nspecifications that were permitted were bedwetting, mental health diagnosis, ADHD,\nspecial education, emotionally disturbed/impaired, and cross racial. These\nplacement parameters were noted on the 2019 and 2020 CWL 3080 CHILDREN’S\nFOSTER HOME RULES COMPLIANCE RECORD. The 2019 CWL 3080 was\n3",
    "signed by the foster parent. The 2020 CWL 3080 was electronically signed due to\nCOVID. It was also confirmed, via MiSACWIS case reviews, that Foster Child A and\nFoster Child B were placed by another agency as borrowed bed placements. I\nreviewed case history information for both Foster Child A and Foster Child B and\nfound neither to have a diagnosis of autism noted in MiSACWIS. I reviewed case\nhistory information for Foster Children C, D, and E. They were placed by the agency.\nOnly Foster Child C was found to have a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, but\nat the time of placement in the foster parent’s home, it was only found on his\nIndividualized Education Plans, dating back to 12/06/18. The most recent Case\nService Plan (04/12/21-07/9/21) notes that the child has ADHD and is on the autism\nspectrum. There was no diagnosis of autism for Foster Child D or E in the historical\ninformation or in the most recent Case Service Plan. Social work contacts were\nreviewed and did not document any disclosure of autism for any of the named\nchildren. One provider contact, dated 07/23/20, entered by the Chief Administrator,\nnoted that the kids (Foster Children C, D, and E) still needed trauma assessments,\nthe behaviors reported by the foster parent were not reported in previous\nplacements, and identified that one of the children was encopretic and smearing\nstool.\nThe Chief Administrator (CA), who was also responsible for the direct case at the\ntime of services, reported phone interview and via follow up emails that the children\ndid not have any behaviors prior to their placement in the foster parent’s home. The\nCA acknowledged that Foster Child C had an IEP for Autism, but it was only from\nthe IEP and not a formal mental health diagnosis. The CA said he fidgets a great\ndeal but other than that, the children were good children. The CA said that in the full\ndisclosure meeting for adoption, the foster parent was advised of this and many of\nthe workers and supervisors asked the foster parent if she would be okay parenting\nthree to four additional children. Per the CA, the foster parent indicated that she\nwould be fine. The CA reported that it wasn’t until after the children were placed in\nher home, that the foster parent started calling the staff related to the kids’\nbehaviors. The CA said that the foster parent complained that the children were\neating all the time and Foster Child E was giving her problems. As time went on, the\nfoster parent continued to call workers and asked for removal of the children, but\nlater said Foster Child E could stay. The agency removed Foster Child C and Foster\nChild D while Foster Child E remained until they found a home for all three of the\nchildren. The CA said that MCI was consulted on this case and a case conference\ncall took place as well. MCI reportedly gave permission to split Foster Child C and\nhis two siblings until the agency could find a home for all three. The CA also\nreported that she felt the problem was that as time went on in the foster home, the\nfoster parent indicated that the children were having all these behaviors. When the\nincreased difficulty of care rate was denied, the foster parent then asked for their\nremoval. The CA reported that since the children have been out of the foster\nparent’s home, they all are doing very well. Most all of the issues that were brought\nto their attention by the foster parent have not been present in their new foster\nhome. The CA forwarded some emails related to setting up the full disclosure\n4",
    "meeting, one of which showed that she sent the IEP to the foster parent. This was\nnot sent to the foster parent until 07/07/20, which was one week after placement.\nThe agency was previously investigated for their special evaluation work related to\nthis foster home in Special Investigation Report (SIR) 2021C0207012. The agency\nwas cited in this investigation for R 327 Special Evaluation, as they did not\ndocument a thorough investigation of the allegations. They combined multiple intake\nallegations, some received three weeks apart, into one report and did not clearly\nidentify all the allegations and when they were received. Additionally, the findings\nand conclusions were not supported by documented facts and information, as the\nagency failed to include the worker’s analysis of gathered information, or\ndescriptions of findings, observations and supporting documentation. The SIR had\nother violations noted for the facility, but also found that the foster parent had three\nadults move into the home prior to obtaining clearances, one of whom had a criminal\nhistory. The foster parent also allowed one of the adults to share a bedroom with\none of the current foster children and to provide care and supervision of the child\ndue to the child’s aggression.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Foster Parent licensing information in MiSACWIS\n Foster Children A, B, C, D, and E-applicable case information reviewed in\nMiSACWIS\n Special Investigation Report 2021C0207012\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12325 License recommendation.\n(1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nappropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained\nin the foster home evaluation and any special evaluations.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation of the rule as the special evaluation\nreports used for the revocation were not completed per licensing\nrules and lacked content.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRenewal Report, 02/10/20, CAP 02/21/20\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12325 License recommendation.\n(5) An agency shall recommend to the department the\ndenial of license issuance, the revocation of a license, or\nthe refusal to renew a license only when both of the\nfollowing conditions exist:\n(a) The applicant or the foster parent falsifies\ninformation or, the applicant or the foster parent\nwillfully and substantially violates the act, 1or more\nof the licensing rules for foster homes, or the terms\nof the license.\n(b) The applicant or the foster parent has been informed,\nin writing, of the facts and the basis for the\nrecommended action.\nANALYSIS: Evidence in the record and discovered in SIR 2021C0207012\nshows the foster parent to be willfully and substantially\nnoncompliant with licensing rules.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nAgency placed youth in licensed foster home that were contrary to preference\ndocumented on the 3706. When foster parent was unable to care for the youth,\nlicense revocation was pursued. One of the youths was eventually placed in a\nresidential where they have been restrained over 40 times.\nINVESTIGATION:\nSee investigation notes above.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12404 Placement.\n(3) An agency's placement of a child in a foster home shall\nbe consistent with the placement specifications for the\nhome.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation of the rule, as Foster Child C’s record\nshows that he was receiving special education services via his\nIndividualized Education Plan, for having an Autism Spectrum\nDisorder, which was not an acceptable specification of the foster\nhome license. Even though the agency reported that the foster\nparent was told of this, there was no documentation in the\nrecord to show that the foster parent was provided this\ninformation prior to placement. Other behaviors the complainant\nreported to be outside of the foster parent’s specifications were\neither found to be listed as acceptable, or not noted in the case\nhistory until after being placed in the foster home.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings in this report, I recommend no change to the current license\nstatus. This recommendation is contingent on the agency submitting an acceptable\ncorrective action plan for the noted violations.\nAugust 09, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 10, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
