Staff Person 1 and\nYouth A did not have questionable boundaries or behaviors after\n12/04/2023, but Staff Person 1’s employment was terminated on\n02/07/2024. It is found that Mott Childrens Residence provided for\nthe needs, protection, and supervision of Youth A.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV.
