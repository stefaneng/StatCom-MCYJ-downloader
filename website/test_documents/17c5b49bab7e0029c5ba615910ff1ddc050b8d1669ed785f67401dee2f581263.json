When Staff 1 was following Youth A, Youth A\nnoticed Staff 1 and ran up to her. When Youth A ran up to Staff 1,\nYouth A poured an entire bottle of water on her and then started pulling\nStaff 1's hair. Staff 1 attempted to get Youth A's hands out of her hair\nand scratched Youth A's arm in the process. Youth A currently has a\nscratch on the left-hand side of her neck that travels on to her chest.\nInvestigation Administrator 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n1/3/2023. She reported Youth A was back in the home and doing well.\n4",
    "She had spoken to the DHHS worker and interviews with Youth A and\nstaff are scheduled for the end of the week.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 1/3/2023.\nShe refused to speak but appeared to be in good health. She presented\nverbal aggression towards staff when asked a question.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n1/9/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported being\ninformed of the incident later in the day after the incident occurred. She\nwas told by Staff 1 and Lead Trainer that the two youth went AWOL,\nand Staff 1 followed them. The youth split up and Staff 1 followed\nYouth A because Youth A is “cognitively impaired” (IQ 65), and they\nfeared for her safety if not unsupervised. Staff 1 informed her that\nYouth A threw a bottle of water at her and then grabbed her hair. This\ncaused them both to fall to the ground. Administrator 1 was unaware if\nLead Trainer was witness to this incident. She also reported staff\nbelieved Youth A may have been on a substance since her eyes were\ndilated, so the EMS was called. She described Staff 1 as the most\nprofessional staff at the facility, who also works in the community and\nschool systems.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n1/9/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported Staff 1\nworks part-time on the overnight shift at the facility. She also reported\nStaff 1 has a “long history” of community involvement and has\ncompleted all required trainings include the “six core” training. Staff 1 is\ndocumented to have attended all staff meetings.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 1/9/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported being present when\nYouth A and Youth B put their coats and backpacks on appeared to be\nready to leave the facility. She attempted to de-escalate the situation by\ntalking to the two youth, but her efforts were unsuccessful. The two\nyouth had reportedly just returned to the facility prior to Staff 1\nbeginning her shift. Staff 1 also reported Lead Trainer was present\nduring their intervention with the youth and was also engaged in the\ndiscussion with the youth. Staff 1 reported the two youth left the facility\nand began walking towards the east with her following approximately\n100 feet behind. At Cedar Street, the two-youth separated, and Staff 1\ncontinued to follow Youth A because of her limited cognitive ability.\nStaff 1 said all at once, Youth A turned and began to swear at Staff 1\nbefore charging towards her. Youth A yelled that she hated Staff 1 and\nwanted to “beat my ass”. As Youth A was approaching Staff 1, Staff 1\nsaid she started backing up. Youth A stopped approaching Staff 1 and\nturned to walk away. As Staff 1 began following Youth A again, Youth A\n4",
    "turned and ran towards her. Staff 1 said when Youth A reached Staff 1,\nshe “dumped water” on Staff 1 before attempting to hit her with the\nwater bottle. She “dumped the whole bottle” on Staff 1 before dropping\nthe bottle. Staff 1 reported attempting to kick the water bottle away from\nthem before “tripping” over Youth A. Youth A tripped over Staff 1 and\ngrabbed Staff 1’s hair. Staff 1 said they both fell to the ground with\nYouth A laying on top of Staff 1. Staff 1 also reported trying to get her\nfingers between Youth A’s fingers so she would let loose of Staff 1’s\nhair. As soon as Youth A let go, Staff 1 said she jumped up and moved\naway from Youth A. At this time, Youth A began to yell to a passerby\nthat Staff 1 was attempting to rape her. Staff 1 reported Youth A had\nahold of her hair for approximately 25 seconds and the whole incident\nbeginning with the water bottle lasted approximately 2 minutes. Staff 1\ndenied grabbing the wrists of Youth A. She also denied telling law\nenforcement she had grabbed Youth A’s wrist but that she just put her\nhands close to Youth A’s wrists. The couple who were walking by the\nincident stopped and Staff 1 informed them of her role at the facility and\nYouth A attempting to go AWOL. Youth A had asked to use their phone\nand Staff 1 informed them they should not allow this. Law Enforcement\nshowed up and Youth A reported Staff 1 was trying to rape her. Staff 1\nreported she didn’t tell Law Enforcement that she grabbed Youth A’s\nwrists but rather just put her hands near Youth A’s wrists. Law\nEnforcement took both Youth A and Staff 1 back to the facility. Lead\nTrainer then took Youth A to the hospital for an evaluation where Youth\nA refused to be seen at the hospital. Youth A noticed a scratch on her\nneck area and reported it occurred during the altercation with Staff 1.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 1/9/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker.

She reported being the other\nyouth who went AWOL with Youth A. She remembers Staff 1 following\nthem until they separated, and said Staff 1 kept following Youth A. She\nalso reported being near the location when the incident between Staff 1\nand Youth A took place. She reported Youth A grabbed Staff 1 and\nStaff 1 pushed Youth A in the chest with one arm. She never observed\nthem on the ground and was told later by Youth A she had been\nscratched and hit by Staff 1.\nMDHHS Case Worker was interviewed face-to-face at the facility,\non 1/9/2023. She reported Youth A is in the process of being moved to\na more secure location. She also reported having no issues with the\n4",
    "facility at this time. She believed the facility had provided services to\nYouth A.\nLead Trainer was interviewed by phone, on 1/9/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported receiving a call of\nYouth A and Youth B getting ready to go AWOL and she went to the\nfacility. She also reported trying to deescalate the youth but them\nleaving anyway. She was only aware of what occurred when Staff 1\nfollowed the youth because she overheard Staff 1 giving a report to\nLaw Enforcement. She denied speaking to Staff 1 about the situation\nand had no concerns about Staff 1’s work with youth at the facility. She\ndescribed the AWOL policy and said staff are to follow the youth and\nkeep them in sight. Staff need to make sure the youth are safe if they\ncan follow them. Staff are to stay behind them until they lose them. The\nother two staff are to stay at the facility for supervision of the other\nyouth. She reported staff are trained to keep distance when following\nbut they have no training about a bite or hair pulling release technique.\nStaff 2 was interviewed by phone, on 1/9/2023 in collaboration with\nMDHHS worker. He reported the incident had already occurred by the\ntime he arrived at the facility at 11:00 pm.

He has never observed any\nnegative issues between Staff 1 and Youth A at the facility and Staff 1\nis the “sweetest” person he knows. He gave a similar description of the\nAWOL policy as Lead Trainer and added that staff need to keep talking\nto the youth to get them to change their mind about going AWOL. One\nstaff should follow the youth and the other staff at the facility should call\nthe police. He described his training on the appropriate action if a youth\nattacks a staff. He reported staff need to put their arms up to protect\nthemselves and “move out of the line of fire.” “Staff are not to push\nthem but rather just back up and get away.”\nWitness was interviewed by phone, on 1/12/2023 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS worker. She reported observing the incident with Youth A\nand Staff 1. She observed Youth A throw water at Staff 1 before\nthrowing the water bottle at Staff 1.

It appeared both Staff 1 and Youth A fell to\nthe ground, but she didn’t see clearly “how they went to the ground”.\nShe also reported they were on the ground for approximately 30\nseconds before getting up. Youth A began screaming at this time. She\nwas not close enough to observe any hair pulling or either hitting each\nother. She reported calling Law Enforcement and was surprised how\nquickly Law Enforcement showed up because she was still on the\nphone with the operator when they showed up. Staff 1 and Youth A had\n4",
    "gotten up and started walking towards the facility when Law\nEnforcement met them.\nDHHS Case Manager was interviewed by phone, on 1/18/2023. She\nreported Youth A is doing much better in her new placement because it\nis a secure facility.
