    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 10/26/23 Staff 1 caught Youth H and Youth M in the bathroom\nstall together in the school on Vista Maria's campus.\nInvestigation I reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI notified Complainant also School Staff 1 of this investigation\nassignment. She expressed no additional concerns.\nI notified Youth H’s Foster Care Worker that I was assigned to\ninvestigate the allegation. She indicated a separation plan has\nbeen in place for the two youth since Spring 2023. Youth H’s\nFoster Care Worker did not have a copy of the plan.\nI notified Youth M’s Foster Care Worker that I was assigned to\ninvestigate the allegation. He expressed no additional concerns.\nI contacted Therapist and requested a copy of the plan to\nseparate Youth H and Youth M. Therapist provided two written\nplans dated 6/22/23; one for each youth entitled Special Plan for\nInappropriate Contact/Boundaries. Each plan only named one\nyouth and referred to the other as “Specified Youth.” Besides not\nidentifying both youths on a single plan, the plans were\ncomplicated and detailed down to the amount of space that should\ncome between the youths. Item 1 of 8 indicated “Youth H and\nSpecified Youth will be placed on a 6-foot status from each other\nensuring safety for both until further notice. This includes school\nhours.”\nTherapist indicated that written separation plans are kept in a log\non the residential units for building staff to review. She said the\nreason they do not include the names of both youths involved is\n“so when they are distributed to each resident’s workers, we are\nnot breaching confidentiality.”\nCCI licensing Rule 400.4130 Privacy and Confidentiality\nindicates a resident’s identity may only be disclosed for public\npurposes if certain criteria are met. The rule does not prohibit\nsharing youth names among facility staff, privately contracted and\ngovernmental child welfare placing agency staff (foster care,\nadoption, juvenile justice, CPS/MIC), DCWL, courts, or\nMISACWIS.\nI interviewed School Staff 3 who has worked at Vista Maria for\nnine years. He said according to the School Principal, “We don’t\n2",
    "abide by separation plans.” Further he said written plans are not\nkept in the school and school staff are not aware of youths who\nmay require separation.\nI met with School Principal for Clara B. Ford; the private charter\nschool located on Vista Maria’s campus. He said that separation\nplans are not in effect and logistically cannot be abided by in the\nschool.\nVIDEO\nI reviewed video of the school hallway the morning of 10/26/23\nshowing Youth M and H in the bathroom together unsupervised\nfor approximately 7 minutes.\n• 9:27:18 School Staff 2 is stationed at the far end of the hallway\nnear the exit door. Youth M leaves her classroom and enters the\nbathroom.\n• 9:28 Youth H is seen around the corner from the bathroom\ntalking to School Staff 1\n• 9:28:20 Youth H enters Youth M’s classroom which is not\nassigned to her.\n• 9:28:55 Youth H leaves Youth M’s classroom, enters a different\nclassroom and exits.\n• 9:29:06 Youth H enters the bathroom where Youth M has been\nfor two minutes.\n• 9:37:30 School Staff 1 walks up and down the hall, then enters\nthe bathroom.\nI interviewed Youth M, age 15, with Rights Officer present. She\nhas been at the facility for ten months and resides in Myriam Hall.\nShe said she and Youth H met at Clara B Ford School and are\n“friends.” The two also see each other at “events” and group\ntherapy. On 10/26/23 Youth M said she was in the bathroom\nwhen Youth H came in. She denied the two planned to meet\nthere at 9:30am. “I was in a stall. She slid under the door…I don’t\nwant to talk about it.” I asked if School Staff 1 caught them in one\nstall together. Youth M said School Staff 1 entered the bathroom\nand told them they were “both in trouble.” “I’m getting punished\nand didn’t do anything,” she complained. I asked how she is\nbeing punished and Youth M refused to discuss the matter further.\nYouth H stated preferring they/them pronouns. I interviewed\nthem, age 16, with Rights Officer present. They said they have\nbeen at Vista Maria for 18 months and reside in Freedom Hall.\n3",
    "Youth H said they attend school, groups and have the same lunch\nperiod as Youth M. “I knew she (Youth M) was in the bathroom\nbecause we planned to meet at 9:30am. We kissed inside the\nstall.” Youth H said the kissing was consensual. I asked why they\nslid underneath the stall. They said they locked the stall next to\nYouth M then climbed into hers so they would appear to be in\nseparate stalls to reduce the likelihood of getting caught by staff.\nYouth H referred to Youth M with she/her pronouns during the first\nportion of the interview. Midway through, they informed me Youth\nM also prefers they/them pronouns and began referring to Youth\nM as they/them. “They’re my girlfriend. We’ve been dating for\neight months as of Wednesday and it’s our anniversary,” they\noffered excitedly.\nI asked Youth H what happened when School Staff 1 caught them\nin the bathroom. They said School Staff 1 saw them through the\ncrack in the door, wrote an incident report and the youths received\nconsequences. “We were not allowed to attend the Homecoming\nDance and Youth M can’t go to Trunk or Treat.”\nI interviewed Complainant/School Staff 1 who has worked at\nVista Maria for five years. She said School Staff 2 was monitoring\nthe far end of the hallway and she and at least three other school\nstaff were monitoring the exit doors and other hallways. “I went\ninto the bathroom because I noticed Youth H was gone too long.\nBoth of the two stalls were locked. Through the crack, I saw them\njump away from each other.” I asked if Youth H and M are on a\nspecial separation plan and she said, “No.”\nI interviewed School Staff 2 who has worked at Vista Maria for\nfive months. She said she was at the far end of the hall and did\nnot see Youth M or Youth H enter the bathroom. There are two\nstalls, but when two are inside, a staff person is supposed to stand\nin the doorway. I asked if Youth H and M are on a special\nseparation plan. She said separation plans are not applicable at\nschool.\nI interviewed School Supervisor who has worked at Vista Maria\nfor 22 years. She said there are usually six school staff assigned\nto monitor the halls and exit doors. “Whoever is in the hall\nwatches the bathroom. No particular staff is assigned to monitor\nthe bathroom. We have no knowledge of documented safety or\nseparation plans. If we had a simple, uncomplicated plan to keep\ntwo youths separate, it still wouldn’t be 100% foolproof.”\n4",
    "I attempted to interview Vista Maria’s Vice President of\nAcademic Programming. However, she resigned six weeks ago\nand could not be interviewed.\nI reviewed Vista Maria’s Guidelines for Staff called Back to Basics.\nIt indicates that school staff supervise clients while they are in the\nbathroom. Rights Officer clarified that this applies if more than\none youth is in the school bathroom.\nAnalysis School staff did not follow Vista Maria’s Guidelines that requires\nthem to supervise more than one youth in the school bathroom.\nSchool staff must abide by separation plans that indicate youths\nwill be separated at school.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nIt is not only acceptable, its essential to identify both youths on\nwritten separation plans. Separation and other special behavior\nplans should be available to staff who work in the school.\nAs stated above, Rule 400.4130 Privacy and confidentiality\ndoes not prohibit sharing youth names among facility staff,\nprivately contracted and governmental child welfare placing\nagency staff (foster care, adoption, juvenile justice, CPS/MIC),\nDCWL staff, courts, and MISACWIS. Youth identities must be\nshared as it is required for facility and child welfare staff to perform\ntheir jobs.\nAdditionally, Vista Maria has provided redacted incident reports\nand other documents missing the names of youths to DCWL\nConsultants during the course of special investigations and should\nnot be.\nSee Public Act 116 – MCL 722.120 Investigation, inspection, and\nexamination of conditions, books, records, and reports; access by\ndepartment (defined as MDHHS on page 2), bureau of fire\nservices, or local authorities; records; report; forms; confidentiality;\ndisclosure of information; availability of confidential records; child\ninformation cards to be provided to department; failure of licensee\nto cooperate with investigation, inspection, or examination\nindicates:\n(1) The department may investigate, inspect, and examine\nconditions of a childcare organization and may investigate and\nexamine the books and records of the licensee.

However, school staff indicated they did not\nsee the plans or abide by them in school. Before writing plans to\nbe implemented by other staff, therapists should first check with\nUnit Managers, Residential Supervisors, School Supervisor, and\nanyone else involved to make sure staff are able to follow the\nplan. Plans should be distributed to all staff, including school staff,\nand written in a way that is realistic and easy to understand.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2023C0000510, intake 6/1/23, CAP approved 7/25/23\nIV.
