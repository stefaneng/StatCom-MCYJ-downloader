DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nIV.

CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• There was no consultation requested or required.\n2",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The CAP\nrequired was the outcome of the Renewal Inspection for 2024 and involved\naddressing 4 rule violations. The violations involved CCI Rule 400.4113 1.f.ii, CCI\nRule 400.4113 1.i, CCI Rule 400.4113 1.j, CCI Rule 400.4114 1. The facility\nupdated policies/procedures as required, updated the electronic HR record\nkeeping system as requested, and informed the identified administration staff of\nthe changes. This CAP was reviewed quarterly and successfully completed on\n3/27/25.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator identified that a CAP prior to this reporting period was\nsuccessfully completed as was the CAP for the renewal inspection last year. She\nsupports this success on the fact that there were no repeat violations found during\nthis interim inspection. Because of a budget increase the program has been able to\nhire more staff thus ensuring the appropriate level of supervision is being provided\nthrough the overnight hours. It is also documented the onboarding process for new\nemployees now includes “in-person bed-check training”. They are providing more\noversite for new employees as part of the on-boarding process. The Chief\nAdministrator notes there is a change in stays at the shelter with more youth seeing\nalternative places to stay quickly so stays at the shelter are shorter in duration. She\nnotes with the higher level of oversite; there is a higher level of staff turnover since\nnegative issues with staff are identified quicker. Thus, the staff who stay are more\nqualified to provide the level of care required.\n3",
    "Staff and Youth Interviews\nStaff were interviewed and all were part of the administration team. No direct care\nstaff were present because currently the program has no youth. Staff reported they\nare in the transition phase of putting all records into a new electronic system. They\nreported some struggles with the new system but understand as they use the\nprogram more, it will help with record keeping. They reported with no youth in the\nprogram; they are able to clean the building and make any changes to the physical\nstructure such as painting and rearranging items.\nNo youth are currently in the program and the last youth left about a week ago.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThis is a two-story facility of which youth only use the first floor. The facility is\nanother structure but well maintained and clean. All systems (heating, plumbing,\nelectrical) are in working order. Fire extinguishers are up to date, emergency drills\nare in compliance with rules, and bed check logs are being completed\nappropriately. Medication, cleaning supplies, and all chemical items are locked in\ncompliance with rules. Required postings were observed and youth files were\nsecured.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n9/11/2025\n_____________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n9/12/2025\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4",
