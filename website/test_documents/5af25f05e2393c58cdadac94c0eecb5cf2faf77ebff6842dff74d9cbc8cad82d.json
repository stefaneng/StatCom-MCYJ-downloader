    "Staff to Student Resident Ratio and Supervision of Residents policy:\nYouth Specialists will keep their assigned residents within their Line of Sight at all\ntimes. This means a Youth Specialist will be able to see and notice all movement\nand be aware of the whereabouts of their assigned residents at all times during\ntheir shift…\nVehicle sign out sheet:\n July field trip dated on 7/25/19 to Auburn Hills playground.\nI interviewed Resident A. Resident A reported the staff drove the residents to a\nplayground in July using a van. The van had four or five rows. Resident A reported\nResident B, Resident C and herself were in the last row. Resident A reported there was\nmore than six residents in the van, but unsure of the total number. Resident A reported\nthere was one staff driving and Staff 1 sitting in the first row of the van. Resident A\nreported both staff could not see what they were doing. Resident A reported she\ndigitally penetrated Resident B and Resident C vaginas. Resident A reported they all\nshowed each other their pubic hair as well. Resident A reported, Staff 1, Youth Care\nSpecialist, did ask what they were doing because they were laughing loudly. Resident A\nreported the staff were unaware of what they did.\nI interviewed Resident B. Resident B reported the staff drove the residents to a\nplayground. The staff drove a van with five rows. Resident B reported there were\naround eight residents in the van. Resident B reported Resident A and Resident C and\nherself were in the last row.

The other staff was not consistent.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n3",
