DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThis agency is located on the first floor of a single-family home located at 1653 Herrick\nNE, in Grand Rapids. It consists of a meeting room and an equipped office with\nsufficient space for 3 people to work. There is also a locking, fireproof file cabinet for\nstorage of records.\nB. Program Description\nThis agency intends to write home studies for adoptive parents who are interested in\ninternational adoption. The initial focus of the program will be on Chinese adoptions.\nThe agency has a working relationship with the Chinese Children Adoption International\nin Centennial, Colorado.\nThe agency also intends to provide post placement supervision as required by Chinese\nlaw.\nFamilies Through Adoption intends to maintain a client base through direct referrals\nfrom Chinese Children Adoption International. The Agency’s contract with adoptive\nfamilies specifies that while the family contracts with Families Through Adoption for a\nhome study and / or required post adoption services and supervision, Families Through\nAdoption is not involved in the actual foreign adoption process and requires the family to\nenter into a separate contract with an international adoption program such as Chinese\nChildren Adoption International for the placement and adoption of the child.\nCharlene Lanning, the chief administrator of Families Through Adoption, is qualified for\nthis position and has not yet hired staff.\nThe policies, procedures, and forms of this agency have been reviewed and meet\nlicensing rules.\n2",
