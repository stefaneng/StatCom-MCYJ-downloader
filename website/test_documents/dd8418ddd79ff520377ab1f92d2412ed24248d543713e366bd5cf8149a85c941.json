    "7/14/24 PC Prelim Exit\nwith CA\n8/2/23 PC DHS\nDisposition:\nNo findings\nIII. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection\nDescription (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A former staff inappropriately touched a youth's inner thigh.\nInvestigation On 6/13/23 I spoke to Complainant 1. No additional information\nwas provided.\nInterviews at the facility on 6/14/23 with DHHS Worker 1 and\nLaw Enforcement:\nYouth A reported during the interview that Staff 1 has tickled her\nall over and down by her pants, lower belly and inner thigh, genital\narea. Youth A reported Staff 1 doesn’t tickle anyone else. Youth A\nreported she did not tell anyone about it. Youth A reported that\nStaff 1 also ticked Youth B, but was told to stop. Staff 1 then\ndiscontinued tickling Youth B.\nYouth B reported during the interview that staff tickle the youth.\nYouth B reported that staff have tickled her feet, belly, chest,\nbehind the knees and neck. Youth B reported that staff do hug as\nwell.\nYouth C reported during the interview that staff do tickle the youth.\nYouth C reported she has not been tickled by Staff 1.\nAdministrator 1 reported during the interview that she has not had\nissues in the past with Staff 1 tickling youth inappropriately.\nOn 7/13/23 the following phone interviews were done:\n2",
    "Supervisor 1 reported that they don’t have a policy that states the\nstaff cannot tickle the youth. Supervisor 1 was unsure if tickling\nwas ok and stated she would have to look up policies to see.\nSupervisor 1 reported there would not be tickling on the bed\nthough. Supervisor 1 reported she has never had any youth tell\nher that staff were tickling them, and they did not want staff to do\nso. Supervisor 1 reported that Staff 1 has been told to stop\nrubbing a child’s back once. Supervisor 1 reported she had\nstopped and then started again later. Supervisor 1 reported that\nshe did have to repeat herself to Staff 1 to follow various\nexpectations. Supervisor 1 reported she would show\nunderstanding but then go back to doing the previous activity\nagain. Supervisor 1 reported that Staff 1 would have “power\nstruggles” with administration at times. Supervisor1 reported she\nhas never seen or heard about Staff 1 touching a youth\ninappropriately.\nStaff 2 reported staff are allowed to use Haptic Touch. Staff 2\ndescribed this as side hugs, hand holding, and back rubs. Staff 2\nreported staff have to use their discernment to recognize when to\ntouch and when not to based on the youth’s background. Staff 2\nreported tickling is allowed. Staff 2 reported they have had several\nmeetings and trainings pertaining to haptic touch. Staff 2 reported\nshe never noticed any inappropriate touching done by Staff 1.\nStaff 2 reported she never saw Staff 1 tickling a youth. Staff 1\nreported that it would be out of character for Youth A not to be\nvocal if someone touched her in a way she didn’t like. Staff 2\nreported she might be quiet if it was bullying from other youth\nthough. Staff 2 reported that Staff 1 was good at being at\ntrainings.\nInterview 7/13/23 with DHHS Worker 1:\nStaff 1 did bring a support person into the interview. It was clear\nthat Staff 1 would need some accommodations due to cognitive\nunderstanding. DHHS Worker 1 and I rephrased questions and\nbroke down words for better understanding. Staff 1 reported the\nagency encouraged physical touch with the youth. Staff 1 reported\nthey could give high fives, play tag, and tickling. Staff 1 reported\none time she was asked to stop tickling a youth and she did listen.\n(This was not Youth A). Staff 1 reported she has not touched\nanyone in the genital area while tickling on accident or purpose.\nThe following documents were reviewed:\n3",
    "Haptic Support and Physical Touch Policy:\n…children need positive haptic support and loving guidance to\nunderstand positive touch and healthy affection…trauma informed\nguidelines…govern physical touch between staff and residents.\n• No laying with a resident\n• No resident heads resting in laps\n• No “spread eagle” positioning on a staffs lap, or anywhere\nelse on a person\n• No piggy back rides\n• No full front hugs\nThe policy does not specify that tickling is disallowed.\nYouth A safety plan:\nIdentified strengths-based strategies that have helped you de-\nescalate in the past:\n• Haptics\nI reviewed Staff 1’s training and policy compliance meetings with\nadministration. Staff 1 was compliant with training requirements.\nStaff 1 had one “Policy Compliance Meeting” where she had a\ndiscussion on respecting youth’s boundaries. Staff had refused to\ncomply when told to respect boundaries.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to validate the allegations. The agency\nallows tickling of youth by staff. Staff are to use discernment when\ntickling or touching a youth in a nurturing way. The agency policy\ndoes not specify that tickling is not allowed. There were no\nwitnesses to collaborate an inappropriate touching from Staff 1\ntowards Youth A. Should additional information become available\nthis investigation will be re-opened.\nAnother Department of the state had no findings.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\n4",
    "Based on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n7/26/23\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
