Physical Description of Facility\nThe facility is located in a residential neighborhood in Warren, Michigan. The facility is\nlocated in a 1 ½ story building. The first floor has two bedrooms, each containing three\nbeds. The rooms also contain closet and storage space for clothing and personal items.\nThe rooms are nicely decorated and clean. Also found on the first floor is a full\nbathroom, a storage closet, a living room, kitchen, and a dining/recreation room. The\nrooms are all clean, nicely decorated, and in good repair. Medications are stored\ndouble locked in a cabinet in the kitchen. Appropriate furniture and televisions are\nlocated in the living and recreation rooms. The basement of the facility has storage\nrooms, a staff office, and a garage. Resident records are kept locked in the staff office.\nThe second floor of the facility consists of a large room, storage closets and a\nbathroom. This room is furnished with a daybed set up as a couch, chairs, and a desk.\nThe room will be used for therapy sessions, homework space, and if necessary, can\nalso be used as a bedroom, under the condition that it is not used for other purposes.\nThis room has a locked door which leads outside to stairs and an outside deck. It is\nnoted that a variance was requested and approved to R400.4640(1), regarding the\ninterior staircase leading from the first floor to the second floor. The rule states “In new\nand converted facilities, stairs shall have treads of uniform width and risers of uniform\nheights. Treads shall be not less than 9 ½ inches deep, exclusive of nosing, and risers\nshall not be more than 7 ¾ inches in height.” This variance was necessary due to the\nfact that the first four stairs on the interior staircase were 7 ½ inches deep, rather than\nthe required 9 ½ inches. The variance request was approved on 05/20/13. The facility\nhas outdoor space in a fenced-in backyard, however this area is not used at this time.\nThe plan is to install a privacy fence, at which time the outdoor space may be used by\nresidents with staff supervision. Surveillance cameras are located outside the facility,\nas well as inside in common areas. The facility was found to be clean and in good\nrepair.\n2",
    "B. Program Description\nThe program is a crisis stabilization and step down program, for males and females,\nages 8-17 years of age. The facility is being licensed for a capacity of 6 residents. The\nprogram will care for residents who have significant behavioral and mental health\nissues, with a range of cognitive levels of functioning. Most residents who will be\nreferred to the facility will be placed there as an alternative to acute psychiatric\nhospitalization placement, or as a step down from these types of placements. The\naverage length of stay will not extend beyond 14 days. During placement residents will\nreceive medical and dental care services, in addition to individual and group therapy,\nand psychiatric/medication management services. The facility contracts with physicians\nand a psychiatrist who come to the facility to care for residents. The facility also\nemploys a registered nurse who oversees medical and psychiatric medication needs.\nThe staff to resident ratio is 1:3 during both awake and sleeping hours. Line of sight\nsupervision is the expectation of staff for all residents at all times, aside from personal\ncare time. Education will be provided to residents through schoolwork provided by\nparents/guardians, and through an on-line educational program. The facility is licensed\nas a Children’s Therapeutic Group Home, and thus no form of seclusion or physical\nrestraint will be used or permitted. Facility staff will be trained in the use of Crisis\nPrevention and Intervention (CPI), for de-escalation and safety purposes, however the\nfacility’s written policy indicates that no form of seclusion or physical management may\nbe used for any reason. Residents will assist staff with cooking meals and with laundry.\nAll of the facility’s policy and procedures were reviewed and approved by the consultant.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThere are no rule or statutory violations.\n3",
