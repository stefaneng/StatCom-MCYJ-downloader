Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nAgency worker at CPA was attempting to coerce client into signing incomplete\npaperwork regarding parent contact.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/22/2021 I received an on-line complaint written by Parent A alleging that Foster\nCare Worker 1 (FCW1) showed up at her home one night after 9pm, while Parent A\nwas asleep, asking her to sign a form he needed for court the following day.\nINTERVIEWS\nParent A - On 2/25/2021 I interviewed Parent A by phone. Parent A reported that\nher children, Youth A and Youth B, were removed from her care on 10/9/2018. She\nstated that FCW1 was initially assigned to her case, but she has since had two other\nworkers. She stated that FCW1 asked her to sign multiple blank documents while he\nwas assigned to her case including visitation forms and Parent Agency Treatment\nPlans (PATP’s.) Parent A reported that FCW1 came to her home one night after\n9PM and asked her to sign a PATP that she had never seen. She reported that\nFCW1 stated that he needed her signature on the document for court the following\nday and told her he would report that she was “non-compliant” if she did not sign.\nShe stated that she refused to sign until she was able to review the document along\nwith her attorney, which never happened. She stated that she couldn’t recall the\nexact date that this happened, but it was her initial PATP. She stated that he\nprovided her with a PATP at another time that had been signed by the worker and\nhis supervisor several months prior. She reported that she did sign that PATP. She\nreported that she wasn’t involved in any discussions or Family Team Meetings\n(FTM’s) regarding the development of any of the PATP’s while CW1 was managing\nher case, but she has been involved with case planning and has received PATP’s\ntimely since CW2 and subsequently CW3 were assigned to the case.\n3",
    "Supervisor 2 – On 3/4/2021 I interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone. She reported that\nshe did not supervise FCW1 and did not begin supervising Parent A’s case until\nApril of 2019 at which time CW2 was assigned the case. She reported that FCW1\nand Supervisor 1 are no longer with the agency, so she does not have additional\ninformation about Parent A’s allegations other than to indicate that CW2 had “a lot of\ncatch up to do” when she inherited the case.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nMiSACWIS – On 2/22/2021 I reviewed Parent A’s case file in MiSACWIS and\nviewed the following documents:\n Initial Service Plan Parent Agency Treatment Plan (PATP 1) signed by CW1\n& Supervisor 1 dated 11/26/2018\n Parent A’s signature not present\n No service plan development FTM documented\n Updated Service Plan Parent Agency Treatment Plan (PATP 2) signed by\nCW1 and Supervisor 1 dated 2/18/19\n Parent A’s signature dated 4/23/19\n No service plan development FTM documented\n Updated Service Plan Parent Agency Treatment Plan (PATP 3) signed by\nCW2 and Supervisor 1 dated 4/30/2019\n Parent A’s signature dated 6/24/2019\n No service plan development FTM documented\n Case Assignment history documenting that CW1 was assigned to the case\n10/9/2018 until 4/5/2019 after which CW2 was assigned.\n Case Assignment history documenting that Supervisor 1 was assigned to the\ncase 10/9/2018 until 6/1/2019 after which Supervisor 2 was assigned\n Updated Service Plan Parent Agency Treatment Plan (PATP 4) signed by\nCW2 and Supervisor 2 dated 7/2/2019\n Parent A’s signature dated 7/24/2019\n Service Plan FTM dated 6/25/2019\nPersonnel Records – On 3/12/2021 I received and reviewed the following\ndocuments:\n Termination letter dated 4/12/2019 addressed to CW1 citing performance\nconcerns\n Performance Concerns and Duties Changes letter dated 7/2/2018 addressed\nto Supervisor 2 citing performance concerns, which included:\n Failure to consistently follow through with assigned responsibilities\n Lax oversight of assigned staff\n Lack of consistent staff supervision\n Failure to provide good, consistent support & leadership to staff\n Performance Improvement Plan dated 2/22/2019 addressed to Supervisor 2\nciting continued concerns, including”\n Inability to hold staff accountable\n4",
    " Inconsistent and unpredictable attendance\n Lax oversight of assigned staff\n Performance Improvement Plan update dated 3/29/2019 addressed to\nSupervisor 2 citing continued concerns, including:\n Failure to follow through with assigned tasks and responsibilities\nISEP 6.33(c) Assessments and Service Plans, Content (Commitment 69).\n(c) Service plans shall be signed by the caseworker, the\ncaseworker’s supervisor, the parent(s), and the child(ren), if\nof age to participate. If the parent(s) or child(ren) or both\nare not available or decline to sign the plan, the service\nplan shall include an explanation of the steps taken to\ninvolve them and shall identify any follow-up actions to be\ntaken to secure their participation in services.\nANALYSIS: While it cannot be established that CW 1 asked Parent A to sign\nblank documents, the lack of her signature on PATP 1 supports\nher allegation that she refused to sign without being given the\nopportunity to review the document. Parent A’s signature on\nPATP 2 was dated 64 days after the report date supporting her\nallegation that she was not provided with the report for months\nafter it was completed. Additionally, Parent A’s signature on\nPATP 3 was dated 55 days after the report date. PATP 1 and\nPATP 2 were both completed by CW1. PATP 3 was completed\nby CW2; however, CW2 had only been assigned to the case for\n25 days prior to the report date. All three of the PATP’s were\napproved and supervised by Supervisor 1. Additionally, PATP 4\nwas signed by Parent A 12 days after the report date at which\ntime the case was being managed by CW2 and supervised by\nSupervisor 2 supporting Parent A’s allegation that she has been\nprovided with reports timely since CW1 was no longer involved.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2020 Renewal inspection dated 6/4/2020, CAP approved\n7/21/2020\n2019 Interim inspection dated 6/12/2019, CAP approved\n7/1/2019\n5",
    "722-06B Family Team Meetings\nThe following events shall trigger FTM for out of home\ncases:\n• Case service plan development\nANALYSIS: FTMs were not documented to have taken place for service plan\ndevelopment of PATP 1, 2 or 3. PATP 1 and PATP 2 were both\ncompleted by CW1. PATP 3 was completed by CW2; however,\nCW2 had only been assigned to the case for 25 days prior to\nthe report date. All three of the PATP’s were approved and\nsupervised by Supervisor 1. A service plan development FTM\nwas documented to have occurred prior to the completion of\nPATP 4 at which time the case was being managed by CW2\nand supervised by Supervisor 2 supporting Parent A’s allegation\nthat she has participated in case planning since FC1 was no\nlonger involved.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2020 Renewal inspection dated 6/4/2020, CAP approved\n7/21/2020\n2019 Interim inspection dated 6/12/2019, CAP approved\n7/1/2019\nALLEGATION:\nAdditional concerns that Supervisor was not following up on concerns appropriately\nor timely to include engaging youth in counseling timely.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/22/2021 I received an on-line complaint written by Parent A alleging that Youth\nA did not receive counseling services for 9 months despite CW1 being aware that\nYouth A was self-harming.\nINTERVIEWS\nParent A - On 2/25/2021 I interviewed Parent A by phone. She reported that, during\na visit with her daughter in November of 2018, she noticed cut marks on her\ndaughter’s arm. Parent A reported that CW1 also saw the marks and told Parent A\nthat he would “follow-up” on these concerns, but Youth A did not receive any\ncounseling services until July of 2019\nSupervisor 2 - On 3/4/2021 I interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone. She reported that\nshe did not know the details of Youth A’s counseling prior to Supervisor 2 being\nassigned to supervise the case in July of 2019 at which time she was engaged in\nmultiple counseling and support services. She reported that these services were all\nput into place in May of 2019 after CW2 took over the case from CW1.\n6",
    "DOCUMENT REVIEW\nMiSACWIS – On 2/22/2021 I reviewed the following in the case file:\n FTM dated 11/19/2018 documenting that Youth A would receive\ncounseling at school until her planned placement change, at which\ntime she would be referred to additional counseling services\n PATP 1 dated 11/26/2018 documenting that Youth A was in need of\ncounseling services, but it was “unclear what therapy service provider\nwould be appropriate given the uncertainty and possibility of placement\nin different counties;” however, Youth A’s school counselor was\ncompleting a referral to Kent Social Services Network to determine if\nadditional or more intensive mental health services were necessary\n PATP 2 dated 2/18/2019 documenting that Youth A was admitted to a\nmental health behavioral stabilization home on 01/10/2019 after\nverbalizing suicidal ideation\n PATP 3 dated 4/30/2019 documenting that Youth A was released from\nthe mental health behavioral stabilization program on 01/19/2019 with\na safety plan created by Network180 and recommendation for\ncontinued weekly counseling with her school therapist\n PATP 4 dated 7/2/2019 documenting that Youth continues to\nparticipate in weekly counseling with her school therapist, began\nworking with the Enhanced Foster Care Team on 5/20/2019, started\nTrauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on 6/17/2019 and\nparticipated in a trauma assessment on 7/2/2019\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nMiSEP 6.20 p.24 Provision of Services (Commitment 70)\nDHHS shall ensure that the services identified in the service\nplan are made available in a timely and appropriate manner\nto the child and family and shall monitor the provision of\nservices to determine whether they are of appropriate\nquality and are having the intended effect.\nANALYSIS: Youth A received counseling and mental health services\nthroughout the entirety of the case as determined appropriate by\nservice providers.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nTechnical Assistance is being provided regarding the use\nof school counseling in place of mental health assessments\nand community counseling services when it has been\ndetermined that a youth could benefit from additional\nservices.\n7",
    "ALLEGATION:\nThe parent did not get visits with child for 3 weeks.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/22/2021 I received an on-line complaint written by Parent A alleging that CW1\ndid not arrange for visitation with her children until 3 weeks after they were removed\nfrom her care.\nINTERVIEWS\nParent A - On 2/25/2021 I interviewed Parent A by phone. Parent A reported that\nher children were removed from her care on 10/9/2018 but she did not get a visit\nwith them for 3 weeks. She reported that CW1 told her the agency policy was that\nshe could not have visitation with them the first week they were in care, but she\nwould be allowed to visit them at the agency after that. She stated that she did not\nget visitation the second week either and CW1 told her that Youth A did not want to\nvisit with her, so she couldn’t visit with Youth B either.\nSupervisor 2 - On 3/4/2021 I interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone. She reported that\nthere was a no contact order in place between Parent A and both youth at the\nbeginning of the case. She reported that the no contact order was in place for a\ncouple of months. After the no contact order was lifted, Youth A refused to visit with\nParent A, but Youth B started to have visits with Parent A. Supervisor A looked in\nthe MiSACWIS case file during our conversation and she reported that she was\nunable to locate documentation of the no contact order, but she did see that a\nparenting time exception regarding suspension of Parent A’s parenting time was\ncompleted on 1/7/2019. Supervisor 2 stated that she would email me the preliminary\norder indicating that parenting time was to be suspended when she next went into\nthe office. She also stated that she would look in the physical file for the no contact\norder.\nOn 3/8/2021, Supervisor 2 sent me an email message with a court order attached.\nHer email stated, “here is the first order – it says parenting time would be harmful to\nthe children. Once the no contact order was lifted is when it changed to ‘when\ndeemed appropriate’…” I reviewed the attached court order, which was an Order of\nDisposition dated 1/3/2019. I responded with a request for the preliminary hearing\norder, which she then sent along with order for removal. I requested a copy of the no\ncontact order she reported was in place at the onset of the case to which she\nresponded that she could not locate it in the physical file.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nMiSACWIS – On 2/22/2021 I reviewed the following:\n Case contact dated 11/1/2018 documenting parenting time between Parent A,\nYouth A, and Youth B\n Parenting time exception completed on 1/7/2019 citing a needed therapist\nrecommendation regarding visitation\n8",
    "Court Orders – On 3/8/2021 I reviewed the following court orders:\n Order to Take Children into Protective Custody and Place dated 10/9/2018,\nno mention of a no contact order\n Order After Preliminary Hearing dated 10/9/2018 which indicated that\n“parenting time of Parent A was ordered to be supervised until further order of\nthe court.”\n Order of Disposition dated 1/3/2019 which indicated that parenting time with\nParent A “even if supervised may be harmful to the children.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06I PARENTING TIME\nChildren under MDHHS care and supervision who have a\npermanency goal of reunification must be provided\nparenting time unless an approved exception exists see\nParenting Time Exceptions in this item. Parenting time\nbetween the parent(s) and child(ren) is facilitated by the\nsupervising agency.\nFrequency of parenting time must occur as indicated\nbelow:\n• Six years and older, visits occur, at a minimum, once per\nweek.\nANALYSIS: Parent A did not receive parenting time until 23 days after her\nchildren were removed from her care, despite the preliminary\ncourt order allowing supervised parenting time and there being\nno parenting time exception requested or approved until\nJanuary of the following year.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency was selectively following court orders.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/22/2021 I received an on-line complaint written by Parent A alleging that\nagency staff were selectively following court orders. No specifics were provided.\nINTERVIEWS\nParent A - On 2/25/2021 I interviewed Parent A by phone. She reported that Youth\nA was placed with her dad, Parent B, without a court order allowing them to do so.\nShe stated that Supervisor A sent threatening text messages to her mother, with\nwhom Youth A was placed, stating that Youth A would be moved to another home if\n9",
    "Parent A’s mother didn’t do what Supervisor 1 wanted. Parent A stated that she\nbelieves Supervisor 1 moved Youth A to Parent B’s home as retaliation. Parent A\nstated that she would send me copies of the text messages for me to review;\nhowever, I have not received them.\nYouth A subsequently ran away from Parent A’s mother home after which the\nagency placed Youth A in Parent B’s home. Parent A stated that Youth A was in\nParent B’s home for 3 weeks before an “emergency hearing” was held ordering\nplacement into Parent B’s home.\nSupervisor 1 - On 3/4/2021 I interviewed Supervisor 1 by phone. Supervisor 1\ndenied threatening Parent A’s mother but stated that they did have a text exchange\nabout her unwillingness to provide transportation for Youth A despite this being\npreviously agreed upon and that if she didn’t follow policies, Youth A would have to\nmove.\nSupervisor 1 stated that the agency had a court order in place at the time Youth A\nwas placed in Parent B’s home which gave them authority to make the placement.\nShe stated that the placement was made due to Youth A no longer wanting to be in\nParent A’s mother’s home stating that she was too much like Parent A.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nMiSACWIS – On 3/4/2021 I reviewed the following documentation:\n Youth A’s placement history documenting placement with Parent B on\n11/2/2020\n Updated Service Plan dated 11/5/2020 which documented that, on\n10/14/2020 Parent A’s mother, with whom Youth A was placed stated that\nYouth A was not allowed back in her home. Youth A then went on an\nextended home visit with Parent B and was subsequently placed in his care\non 11/2/2020\n Parent Agency Treatment Plan dated 11/5/2020 which documented Parent\nB’s last dirty drug screen was dated 10/13/3030 and that Kent Reunification\nProgram started on 11/2/2020\nCourt Orders – I reviewed the Order After Dispositional Review/Permanency\nPlanning Hearing dated 9/30/2020 ordering that Youth A may have unsupervised\nvisits with Parent B. It was also ordered that Youth A may be released to Parent B\nupon Parent B providing clean drug screens and a reunification program being in\nplace.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-07B PERMANENCY PLANNING - REUNIFICATION\nCASEWORKER RESPONSIBILITIES IN REUNIFICATION\nPrior to returning a child to the home from which he/she\nwas removed or to the home of the other parent, the\ncaseworker must:\n10",
    " Determine the motivation and capability of the parent or\nlegal guardian to provide for the ongoing safety and well\nbeing of the child.\n Consider whether return home would cause a substantial\nrisk of harm to the child's life, physical health or mental\nwell-being. When the child is placed within his/her\nparent's home, the court must make a written finding that\nthe “Conditions of the placement are adequate to\nsafeguard the child from the risk of harm to the child's\nlife, physical health or mental well-being.”\n Provide documentation that appropriate rehabilitative,\nremedial services have been consistently provided to the\nparent, other relevant adults in the home, and the child to\nminimize the potential for further abuse or neglect.\nOverall, barrier reduction must be either partial or\nsubstantial. Collateral resources from service providers\nmust be utilized in helping the caseworker arrive at a\ndecision to return the child home. Documentation of\ncollateral contact results is to be entered in the case\nservice plan. Include a statement in the case service plan\nthat a decision to return the child home has been\nreviewed and agreed upon by the supervisor.\nANALYSIS: The agency staff had authority by court order to allow\nunsupervised visitation and the subsequent placement of Youth\nA in Parent B’s home.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\n11",
