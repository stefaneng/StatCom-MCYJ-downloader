Staff 1 stated he intervened and\ntook the mop and mop bucket away from Youth A causing Youth A to\nbecome upset by screaming and swearing. Staff 1 reported Youth B\n2",
    "came into the area to talk to Youth A and Youth A pushed Youth B.\nStaff 1 stated Youth A pushed past Staff 1 and moved to the office\narea, grabbed a holiday wreath, and smashed it. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA went to run toward the Christmas tree but before Youth A could get to\nthe tree Staff 1 restrained Youth A. Staff 1 stated he was concerned\nYouth A was going to smash the glass ornaments. Staff 1 stated he\nperceived the immediate safety concern was Youth A getting to the\nChristmas tree and breaking the glass ornaments creating a safety risk.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on January 4,\n2023. Youth A reported he did not want to talk about why he was\nrestrained by Staff 1.
