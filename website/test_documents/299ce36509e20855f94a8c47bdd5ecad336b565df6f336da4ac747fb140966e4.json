Youth was given\ncrutches and Motrin. On 3/23/23 youth was examined and on\n3/29/23 x-ray results indicated a severe fracture and there are\nconcerns that the injury is not consistent with the explanation.\nInvestigation Interviews\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on April 19, 2023,\nby the MDHHS worker. Complainant explained Youth A’s fracture\nis more common among gymnast who land hard on their feet\nresulting with the impact causing a fracture that goes up the tibia.\nComplainant said she has never seen this type of fracture solely\nfrom a cartwheel. Complainant stated she had been of the\nunderstanding that Youth A was on crutches since the accident\nand when told that Youth A had been walking on her foot, she said\nthat could have exacerbated the fracture however she could not\nbe certain. Complainant said her main concern was the length of\ntime it took for Youth A to be seen by medical professional.\nYouth A was interviewed via telephone on March 30, 2023,\nand via TEAMS on April 6, 2023, in collaboration with the\nMDHHS worker. Youth A reported on both March 30, 2023, and\nApril 6, 2023, that her injury was from “landing a cartwheel wrong”\nwhile on the pod and denied any staff hurting her or being\ninvolved in her injury in anyway. Youth A said “most” of her peers\nwitnessed her injury as well as Staff 2. Youth A said on Sunday,\nMarch 19, 2023, she was dancing on her pod and decided to do a\ncartwheel and when she landed her ankle went in and she fell to\nthe ground. Youth A said immediately after she landed her ankle\nbegan to swell up on the outside and she reported being in pain.\nYouth A said she told Staff 2, and he called Supervisor D to the\npod. Youth A said Supervisor D looked at her ankle and gave her\nice and ibuprofen. Youth A said she submitted a medical slip to\nsee the nurse that day. Youth A said she “hopped around” the\n2",

Youth A said she saw Nurse and\nNurse Practitioner on Thursday, March 23, 2023, and was told she\nneeded to have an x-ray of her ankle and continue using crutches.\nYouth A said her ankle turned black and blue so she asked Staff 2\nand Nurse when she would get the x-ray completed and she was\nalways told they did not know. Youth A said she had the x-ray\ndone on Wednesday, March 29, 2023, and found out she had a\nSalter Harris 4 fracture which started in her growth plate and went\nup her tibia. Youth A said she also went and had a CT scan\ncompleted on March 29, 2023, and then saw an orthopedic doctor\non April 5, 2023. Youth A said she has been given a wheelchair\nsince she was not able to use the crutches very well. Youth A said\nshe has been given ibuprofen and ice by staff daily as she\nrequests.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on April\n13, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth B\nsaid she is on the same pod at Youth A and witnessed her injury.\nYouth B said on Sunday, March 19, 2023, the youth were “playing\naround” on the pod and Youth A did a cartwheel and landed\nwrong and her ankle went “in” and was injured. Youth B said\nYouth A said “ow” and then all youth told Staff 2 and Supervisor D.\nYouth B said Youth A’s ankle was swollen on the top and began to\nbruise on the top and sides. Youth B said Youth A was given ice,\nand staff said they were not going to take her to the doctor that\nday. Youth B said the next day Staff 1 gave Youth A crutches to\nuse but she did not always use them and would just “hop around”\ninstead. Youth B said Youth A had to wait until Thursday to see\nthe nurse and then needed an x-ray which she did not have until\nthe following Wednesday. Youth B said Youth A has had a\nwheelchair since the day of the x-ray.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on April\n13, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth C\nsaid she is on the same pod at Youth A and witnessed her injury\nher ankle. Youth C said on Sunday, March 19, 2023, all the youth\nwere “playing around” on the pod and Youth A did a cartwheel and\nlanded wrong. Youth C said Youth A’s ankle began to swell up\nand bruise right away. Youth C said the swelling was “high up” on\nYouth A’s ankle and Youth C thought it was broken right away.\nYouth C said Staff 1 and Staff 2 gave Youth A ice and ibuprofen\nbut told her they “couldn’t do anything else” for her. Youth C said\nSupervisor D came to the pod and said he could not send Youth A\nto the doctor because there was “no extra staff”. Youth C said\n3",
    "Youth A was given crutches to use but she had a hard time with\nthem so stopped using them. Youth C said Youth A did not see\nthe nurse until Thursday and then did not get her x-ray until the\nfollowing Wednesday. Youth C said her and the other youth on the\npod have been helping Youth A get around and she is now in a\nwheelchair.\nNurse was interviewed via TEAMS at the facility, on April 6,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Nurse said she\nis contracted to work at Bay Pines Center for a half-day on\nMonday, full day on Tuesday, half-day on Wednesday, and full\nday on Thursday. Nurse said when a youth is injured the staff put\nin a “medical slip” to her and she places the youth on the schedule\nto see Nurse Practitioner on Thursdays. Nurse said if a youth has\nan immediate need to be seen the staff are to call the triage line,\ngo to a walk-in clinic, or the emergency room. Nurse said after\nclinic on Thursday’s she completes a medical form that includes\nall upcoming appointments that are schedule as well as any\nmedical issue that needs follow-up. Nurse said she makes a copy\nof the medical form and gives it directly to the supervisor on shift,\nprogram manager, and Director as well as gives a copy to the\nAdministrative Assistant who emails it out to all supervisors, group\nleaders, program manager, and Director. Nurse said all staff at\nBay Pines have been trained that x-rays need to be completed\nwithin 24-48 hours of being ordered by Nurse Practitioner.

Nurse said she did see Youth A but did not\nexamine her bare ankle. Nurse said Youth A had her ankle\nwrapped in a brace and it appeared swollen, and Youth A said it\nwas “tender”. Nurse said Youth A said she was not having a lot of\npain and the Motrin was “working”. Nurse said she showed Youth\nA how to use crutches but was not very coordinated and struggled\nusing them. Nurse said when Youth A was examined by Nurse\nPractitioner an x-ray was ordered. Nurse said the need for an x-\nray was documented on the March 23, 2023, medical notes for\nstaff to complete. Nurse said when she arrived at work on\nMonday, March 27, 2023, she learned the x-rays had not been\ncompleted. Nurse said she discussed this with Supervisor D and\nhe followed through and got them completed on March 29, 2023.\nNurse said Youth A has had follow up appointments since her x-\nrays and they have been completed in an appropriate timeframe.\nNurse Practitioner was interviewed via TEAMS at the facility,\non April 6, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker.\nNurse Practitioner said she is employed with the Office of St.\n4",
    "Francis and is contracted to be at Bay Pines Center on Thursday’s\neach week. Nurse Practitioner said she does make herself\navailable to answer messages throughout the week as she is able.\nNurse Practitioner said she was made aware of Youth A’s injury\nwhen she came into clinic on Thursday, March 23, 2023. Nurse\nPractitioner said she examined Youth A’s ankle which was\nswollen, tender, and bruised. Nurse Practitioner said based on\nwhat Youth A had reported hurting her ankle by landing a\ncartwheel incorrectly, and the way the ankle looked Nurse\nPractitioner thought it was a sprain but made the order for the x-\nray to be sure. Nurse Practitioner said she ordered an x-ray, said\nthat Youth A needed to continue to use the crutches she had at\nthe appointment, and remain non-weight bearing. Nurse\nPractitioner said Youth A did not have any brace or wrap on her\nankle the day of the exam. Nurse Practitioner said she made the\norder in the “EPIC” system to notify the hospital of the x-ray order\nand then Nurse documents the need on the medical form for staff\nto complete. Nurse Practitioner said she was notified by the EPIC\nsystem that the x-ray had just been completed on March 29, 2023.\nNurse Practitioner said the message reported a fracture for Youth\nA and so she contacted Nurse and had Youth A brought to the\nOffice of St. Francis to be seen by the sport medicine doctor and\nget casted. Nurse Practitioner said she has never given Bay Pines\nCenter a specific timeframe for when x-rays need to be completed\nhowever, she expected that anything she orders is completed in\n24 to 72 hours.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on April 13,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Staff 1 said he\nwas not working the day Youth A hurt her ankle. Staff 1 said he\ncame into work the day after Youth A hurt her ankle and noticed\nshe was limping and asked her what happened, and she told him\nshe landed wrong when doing a cartwheel. Staff 1 said he looked\nat Youth A’s ankle and it was slightly swollen and bruised on the\ninside and high on her ankle. Staff 1 said he provided Youth A\nwith ice, ibuprofen, and found her crutches to use. Staff 1 said\nYouth A had “good range of motion” and was “walking around on\nher foot”. Staff 1 said Youth A would use her crutches “part of the\ntime” due to being uncoordinated and having a difficult time\nwalking with them. Staff 1 said he thought Youth A’s ankle\nappeared sprained however learned later she had a fracture. Staff\n1 said he is not responsible for setting up medical appointments\nfor youth. Staff 1 said whenever a youth is injured the supervisors\nare notified and they follow through on the medical process.\n5",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed via telephone, on April 10, 2023, in\ncollaboration with the MDHHS worker. Staff 2 said has been a\nYouth Aid since October 2021 and was working on March 19,\n2023, with Youth A when she injured her ankle. Staff 2 said Youth\nA was on the pod and attempted a cartwheel and landed wrong\nand said, “ouch that hurt” and then walked to a chair and sat\ndown. Staff 2 said he called Supervisor D to the pod to look at\nYouth A’s ankle. Staff 2 said a medical slip was completed for\nYouth A to see Nurse Practitioner, and she was given ice and\nibuprofen due to her ankle starting to swell. Staff 2 said he logged\nthe injury in the communication book on the pod for other staff to\nbe aware of Youth A’s injury. Staff 2 said Youth A was walking on\nher foot the remainder of the shift and did not complain of being in\npain. Staff 2 said he did not work again until March 22, 2023,\nhowever, was not working directly with Youth A but did see she\nwas utilizing crutches to walk. Staff 2 said he was aware that\nYouth A was going to see Nurse Practitioner as he helped her fill\nout her medical slip but was not aware she needed x-rays as he is\nnot responsible to follow up on medical appointments. Staff 2 said\nhe was surprised to learn later that Youth A had fractured her\nankle as after the injury she was walking on it and not complaining\nof being in pain.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on April 13,\n2023. Staff 3 said he was previously a fill-in supervisor for about\nthree months. Staff 3 said he was trained by other supervisors that\nit was supervisors’ responsibility to schedule staffing to take youth\nto all their medical appointments. Staff 3 said Nurse provides\nsupervisors a medical calendar with all of the upcoming\nappointments that need to be completed, supervisors hang it on a\nclipboard in the supervisor office, supervisors set up staff\ntransportation to take youth to appointments, once completed the\nsupervisors highlight the appointment on the medical calendar so\nthat all other supervisors are aware the appointments are\ncompleted. Staff 3 said all supervisors were aware of this process\nand followed it to his knowledge.\nSupervisor A was interviewed via telephone on April 20, 2023,\nin collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Supervisor A said he\nhas been a night supervisor since December 2003. Supervisor A\nsaid he was not working when Youth A injured her foot.\nSupervisor A said he came into shift and saw Youth A using\ncrutches and asked her what happened, and she reported to him\nshe hurt her foot and was getting an x-ray to see if it was broken.\nSupervisor A said the youth see Nurse Practitioner on Thursday’s\nduring clinic hours. Supervisor A said after clinic Nurse provides\n6",
    "the supervisors a schedule of upcoming appointments that need\nto be completed, then the supervisors all work on getting staff\ncoverage to take the youth to appointments on the list, and once\ncompleted supervisors highlight the appointment. Supervisor A\nsaid due to working the night shift he does not typically schedule\nthe staffing for these appointments as they are completed during\nthe day, so day supervisors tend to set up the appointments.\nSupervisor A said x-rays should be done as soon as the “staff\nhave time”. Supervisor A said Youth A never asked him for ice or\nibuprofen. Supervisor A said many times Youth A refused to use\nher crutches which was why the facility got her a wheelchair which\nshe has used more consistently.\nSupervisor B was interviewed via telephone on April 13,2023,\nin collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Supervisor B said she\nhas been employed at Bay Pines Center for six and a half years\nand is currently a supervisor. Supervisor B said her exact shifts\nhave changed periodically and has worked 7am to 7pm, 8am to\n8pm, and 9pm to 9am. Supervisor B said when she was working\n9pm to 9am she did assist with getting medical appointments set\nup and completed however while on the other schedules she does\nnot assist as most appointments occur after 8am. Supervisor B\nsaid youth go to clinic on Thursdays and afterwards Nurse will\nprovide supervisors medical notes with all the appointments that\nneed to be completed. Supervisor B said day supervisors are to\nset up staff coverage to take youth to the appointments, once\ncompleted they place the medical notes in a hanging folder for the\nnurse and highlight the medical note sheet, so all supervisors are\naware that appointment has been completed. Supervisor B said\nthis process is well known to all supervisors at Bay Pines Center.\nSupervisor B said she was not working when Youth A hurt her foot\nhowever when she came in that evening, she saw crutches\noutside of Youth A’s door and asked her what happened.\nSupervisor B said Youth A told her she hurt her foot when she\nwas doing a cartwheel and that she had filled out a medical slip to\nsee the nurse. Supervisor B said she viewed Youth A’s ankle\nthrough the bedroom window, and it appeared “slightly swollen but\nnot bruised”. Supervisor B said over the course of the next few\ndays she saw Youth A refuse to use her crutches and she\ncompleted incident reports anytime she witnessed this. Supervisor\nB said she never saw a clinic note that indicated Youth A needed\nan x-ray however she works seven days on and then seven days\noff so it may have been on a week that she did not work.\nSupervisor C was interviewed via TEAMS at the facility, on\nApril 6, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker.\n7",
    "Supervisor C said he has been employed at Bay Pines Center for\ntwelve and half years and is currently a supervisor. Supervisor C\nsaid he was not working with Youth A injured her ankle.\nSupervisor C said when he came into work on Monday, March 20,\n2023, he made rounds on the pods and Youth A told him she\ninjured her ankle. Supervisor C said at that time Youth A’s ankle\nhad no bruising and very little swelling and it appeared to him to\nbe a sprain and not a significant injury that needed immediate\nmedical attention. Supervisor C said Staff 1 asked him for\ncrutches for Youth A, so he found them and provided them to her.\nSupervisor C said Youth A was using her crutches whenever he\nsaw her that day as well as Tuesday and Wednesday. Supervisor\nC said he did not work on Thursday, March 23, 2023, but when he\ncame back into work on Friday, March 24, 2023, Youth A was no\nlonger using her crutches. Supervisor C said he reviewed the\nNurse medical form on Friday, and it indicated Youth A needed to\nuse her crutches until she had an x-ray and since she was no\nlonger on her crutches, he assumed she had already had the x-\nray completed. Supervisor C said he worked Saturday and\nSunday and Youth A did not use her crutches on those days either\nand appeared to be looking “mostly normal” when walking as if\nshe “was recovering from a sprain”. Supervisor C denied asking\nYouth A or any staff if the x-ray had been completed. Supervisor C\nsaid when youth go to clinic, Nurse will complete medical notes\nand they are sent out to supervisors, administration, and group\nleaders. Supervisor C said Nurse will indicate on the medical form\nif a youth has a medical appointment, however if medical need is\nconsidered a high priority Nurse will come and tell the supervisor\non duty and it will be completed that day. Supervisor C said Youth\nA would have seen Nurse Practitioner on Thursday when he was\noff work, and he was unsure if it had been deemed high priority.\nSupervisor C said there is no procedure in place to ensure items\nof the medical notes are completed between supervisors.\nSupervisor C said most supervisors try to communicate by\nsending an email about items from their shift that needs to be\nfollowed up on or communicated to the next shift. Supervisor C\nsaid all supervisors set up medical appointments when they get\ntime, and he is not familiar with specific timeframes for\nappointments but rather they do them “when they get staff and\ntime”.\nSupervisor D was interviewed via TEAMS at the facility, on\nApril 6, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker.\nSupervisor D said he has been working at Bay Pines Center for\nfive and a half years and is currently a supervisor. Supervisor D\nsaid he was working when Youth A hurt her ankle and he was\n8",
    "called down to her pod to talk with her. Supervisor D said Youth\nA’s ankle was not swollen or bruised but she was complaining that\nit hurt so he provided her with Motrin and ice. Supervisor D said\nYouth A told him she was doing a cartwheel and “landed funny”.\nSupervisor D said Youth A wrote a medical slip and he put it in the\nmedical box for her to be seen in clinic on Thursday. Supervisor D\nsaid he was off work on Monday and Tuesday and when he came\nback to work on Wednesday Youth A was using crutches.\nSupervisor D said he did not work directly with Youth A that day\nbut did check in briefly with her and she did not complain of pain,\nand he did not see her ankle that day. Supervisor D said Youth A\nwas then seen by Nurse Practitioner on Thursday and an x-ray\nwas ordered. Supervisor D said Nurse writes up clinic notes each\nThursday and provides a copy to the supervisor on duty, typically\naround 4 or 5pm. Supervisor D said the same notes also get sent\nout in a group email to supervisors and administration. Supervisor\nD said when Nurse brought the notes that Thursday, she did not\nspecifically mention anything about Youth A’s need for immediate\nx-rays. Supervisor D said he placed the notes on a clipboard in\nthe supervisor office, which is standard practice, for the\nsupervisors coming on shift the next few days to review and get\nmedical appointments completed. Supervisor D said due to getting\nthe clinic notes later in the day the medical appointments get\nschedule and completed starting on Friday. Supervisor D said\nonce a medical appointment is completed the supervisor will\nhighlight it on the clinic notes on the clipboard, he noted this is\nwell known to all supervisors. Supervisor D said when he came\ninto work on Monday he reviewed the clinic notes and saw that\nYouth A did not get her x-ray competed and so he doubled check\nwith Nurse and she confirmed in the system that they had not\nbeen done and so he set up transportation for her to go on\nWednesday, March 29, 2203. Supervisor D said Youth A was\nusing one crutch whenever he saw her on Monday and Tuesday.\nSupervisor D said he is not aware of specific timeframes to get x-\nrays completed and that supervisors try to get everything on the\nclinic notes completed within the week, so they are done by the\nfollowing clinic day.\nDirector was interviewed via telephone on March 30, 2023, via\nTEAMS on April 6, 2023, and face-to-face at the facility on\nApril 13, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker.\nDirector said Youth A had an x-ray ordered at medical clinic on\nMarch 23, 2023, and was not taken in until March 29, 2023.\nDirector said Supervisor C failed to follow the procedure they have\nin place and did not take Youth A in for her x-rays on March 24,\n2023, as he was expected to. Director said all supervisors are\n9",
    "trained that x-rays and labs should be completed within 24 to 48\nhours unless Nurse Practitioner says differently. Director\nconfirmed that this expectation has been reviewed with Supervisor\nC. Director said the process for medical appointments is for Nurse\nto provide a copy of clinic notes to the supervisor on duty the day\nof clinic, those notes are placed on the clipboard in the supervisor\noffice, supervisors set up transportation and complete the medical\nappointments, and then place medical documents in a medical\nfolder for nurse and highlight the appointment on the clinic notes\non the clipboard. Director said Supervisor C is well aware of this\nprocess.\nDocuments Reviewed\n• Incident Report 151380198 dated March 19, 2023.
