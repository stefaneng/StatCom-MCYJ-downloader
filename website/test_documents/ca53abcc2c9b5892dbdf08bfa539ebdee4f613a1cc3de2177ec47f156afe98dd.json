INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\nSection (1) An agency’s medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nDescription minimum, include all of the following:\n1",
    "(b) The provision of emergency medical, surgical, and dental\ncare.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Care agency is not taking appropriate action to secure\nneeded dental treatment for a foster youth.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on April 3, 2023.\nComplainant stated she has had placement of Youth A since May\n2022. She stated she took Youth A to a dentist on February 15,\n2022, and was informed that he has 5-6 cavities, a temporary cap\non one tooth that needs to be removed and needs a root canal.\nShe stated the dental issues are causing Youth A significant pain\nand headaches. She stated that since Youth A is a temporary\ncourt ward, she is not able to provide the dentist office with the\nauthorization to complete the needed dental work. She reported\nthe dental issues to Foster Care Worker (FCW) following the\nappointment and let her know the dentist office was able to\nschedule the follow up surgery within a week but, to date, nothing\nhas been authorized. Complainant stated Youth A’s biological\nmother is not psychologically capable of giving consent at this\ntime and his biological father has had limited communication and\nFCW has not been able to obtain consent from him.\nChildren’s Services Director (CSD) was interviewed via video\nconference on April 4, 2023. CSD stated Youth A’s biological\nmother has been hospitalized with significant mental health\nconcerns and biological father has recently moved twice to\ndifferent states and it has been difficult to contact him at times.\nShe stated the agency first became aware of the dental needs on\nMarch 15, 2023, when they received an email from the assigned\nDCWL CPA Analyst. Complainant had also contacted Foster Care\nSupervisor (FC Supervisor) the day before. The agency held an\ninternal meeting and developed a plan to address the concerns on\nMarch 17, 2023. The plan outlined that FCW would attempt to\nhave the biological father provide consent for the dental treatment.\nIt was determined the dental office required that biological father\nneeded to be present at the appointment and could not just\nprovide consent for the treatment or the agency could obtain a\ncourt order. Biological father has scheduled the appointment for\nApril 28, 2023. FCW has already taken steps to obtain a court\norder in the event biological father does not appear for the\nscheduled appointment.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via Teams on\nApril 5, 2023. FCW stated that the Complainant reported to her in\n2",
    "mid-February that Youth A’s teeth were in bad condition, and he\nneeded to see a dentist but did not elaborate. FCW stated she\nwas not aware that Youth A needed dental surgery until March 13,\n2023. Complainant reported to FCW she was not able to schedule\nthe surgery appointment due to not being Youth A’s legal\nguardian. FCW stated she made attempts to contact biological\nfather in order to obtain consent and get the dental surgery\nscheduled but he was slow to respond. In addition, the dental\noffice was providing conflicting information regarding whether\nbiological father only needed to provide consent or if he needed to\nbe present for the surgery. On April 4, 2023, he scheduled the\ndental surgery for April 28, 2023. Due to concerns that biological\nfather may not follow through, FCW has contacted the guardian\nad litem to start the process to obtain a court order to be used if\nnecessary. She is concerned the court may not grant the request\nbecause biological father is willing to provide consent and attend\nthe surgery. The concerns were not brought up during the court\nhearing on March 22, 2023, because biological father was\ncommunicating and stated he was willing and able to schedule the\nappointment.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FC Supervisor) was interviewed via\nTeams on April 5, 2023. FC Supervisor stated Complainant\ncontacted him March 14, 2023, regarding Youth A’s dental needs.\nPrior to that date, he was not aware of the extent of Youth A’s\ndental needs. He explained to her that efforts need to be made to\nobtain consent from biological father first since his parental rights\nare intact. The concerns were not brought up during the court\nhearing on March 22, 2023, because biological father was\ncommunicating and stated he was willing and able to schedule the\nappointment.\nDocuments reviewed:\n Youth A’s MISACWIS health profile. Reviewed\ndocumentation from initial dental visit on 7/5/2022. In the\ntreatment section of the report the box for root canal is not\nchecked. Report indicates a referral was made for another\ndental provider for specialized treatment. Documentation\nfrom periodic dental visit on 2/16/2023 received on\n4/5/2023. The report notes Youth A needs a root canal.\n 3/10/2023 USP does not mention anything about concerns\nwith Youth A’s teeth.\n 1/11/2023 court order and 3/22/2023 court order was\nreviewed. There is nothing mentioned regarding dental\nissues in either order.\n3",
    " Social work contacts between 3/13/2023-4/4/2023 were\nreviewed. There were 8 telephone calls and one text\nmessage between FCW and biological father regarding\nYouth A’s dental needs. In addition, there were 5 phone\ncalls and one email between FCW and dental office. The\ncontacts document FCW was given conflicting information\nfrom the dental office regarding who could provide consent\nfor Youth A’s dental surgery and whether Youth A’s\nbiological father needed to be present for the dental\nsurgery. FCW confirmed on 4/4/2023 that Youth A’s dental\nsurgery is now scheduled for 4/28/2023.\n The agency’s medical and dental policy states only the\nparent of legal guardian may give consent for non-\nemergency or elective surgery.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on the documentation\nreviewed, the FCW was actively communicating with Youth A’s\nbiological father as well as the dental office from the time she was\nmade aware of Youth A’s dental needs on March 13, 2023, to\nensure dental surgery was scheduled.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n___________4/11/2023___________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 12, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
