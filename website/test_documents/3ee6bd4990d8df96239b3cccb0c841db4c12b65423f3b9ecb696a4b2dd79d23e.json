    "ALLEGATION:\nStaff left medical isolation and suicidal youth unattended for extended periods of\ntime.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/28/2021 it was reported to DCWL that staff left youth unattended in isolation at\nthe facility. The complainant stated that on 1/5/21 there was an incident where a\nresident was acting out and all available staff were called to assist. Staff that were\nsupervising three youth in isolation, left their position and did not check on the youth\nfor over two hours. The complainant expressed concern about this lack of\nmonitoring as one youth in isolation was there due to suicidal behaviors.\nDCWL Consultant\nOn 1/28/21 the assigned DCWL consultant for the facility was contacted. The\nconsultant reported no prior investigations of this nature. In addition, the consultant\nreported some active COVID cases at the facility. Therefore, it was determined that\ninterviews would be conducted remotely.\nComplainant\nOn 2/1/21 a phone interview was completed with the complainant. The complainant\nreported not being present for the incident, but hearing about it from someone else.\nThe complainant stated that the incident occurred when several staff were pulled\nfrom their assigned locations to assist with a difficult youth. The incident lasted\napproximately three hours. During that time, a youth in seclusion, under suicide\nwatch, was left unchecked for approximately one hour. Two other youth were also in\nseclusion for medical reasons and went unchecked. The complainant identified\nseveral staff which were working during that time. However, most were involved in\nthe other incident at the facility and not aware of what was happening in the\nseclusion rooms.\nIn addition, the complainant reported concerns about how the facility is handling\nCOVID procedures. The complainant stated that kids do not always wear masks. For\nexample, during a recent shift, kids were frequently eating and keeping their masks\noff. Also, there have been approximately five or six teachers out with COVID or\nquarantining. However, none of the students from those classrooms have had to\nquarantine. When asked if those students had direct contact with the teacher, the\ncomplainant stated they were in the classroom and that should be enough. The\ncomplainant stated that staff are directed to take youth temperatures but not told\nwhy, and they suspect it is because youth have been exposed. The complainant\nfeels that staff should be informed of all staff and youth with potential exposure.\nChief Administrator\nOn 1/29/21 the CA was informed of the investigation. The CA reported being aware\nof the situation, stating that a youth was acting out, which required several staff to\nassist. The situation lasted a long time as staff attempted to deescalate the youth.\nHowever, while attending to this situation, youth in medical isolation were\n3",
    "unattended for approximately 72 minutes The CA reported that some newer staff\nwere working and missed the 15 minute checks that should have been completed.\nThe CA acknowledged that this was a long time for youth to be unchecked and it\nwas not acceptable. The CA has since counseled and retrained staff, and developed\na coverage plan to ensure that this will not happen again. A full internal investigation\nwas completed and a summary available for DCWL review. The CA stated that he\nruns an “above board program” and when mistakes are made, he expects his staff to\nbe honest, admit it, learn, and move forward.\nRegarding the complainant’s COVID concerns, the CA discussed their current\nprocedures, which align with CDC recommendations. The CA reported that masks\nare mandatory for all staff and teachers. Youth are provided masks and encouraged\nto wear them, but cannot be forced. There are currently no COVID positive teachers\non-site. The CA sated that students were not automatically quarantined when a\nteacher tested positive, as they did not have “close contact” as defined by the CDC.\nTeachers are wearing masks, maintaining a six foot or greater distance from\nstudents, and the classrooms are cleaned daily. The facility did have some staff test\npositive in 2020. Video was reviewed by the CA to determine which staff and\nresidents had “close contact” to decide if quarantine was necessary. As the CA was\nmonitoring these cases and contacts to make determinations, not all of this\ninformation was shared with all staff. Staff not being fully informed of cases with co-\nworkers, due to privacy reasons, is what likely lead to rumors and speculation.\nLastly, the CA reported feeling that he knew the source of this complaint and\nbelieved it to be a certain staff that has their own ideas about how tracking and\nquarantine should work, and is not satisfied with CDC recommendations.\nDocuments reviewed\n The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations for COVID-19 in\ncongregate care were reviewed. The agency’s COVID plan appears to be in\ncompliance with the CDC guidelines. Specific to the complainant’s concern\nabout quarantining youth from a classroom with a COVID positive teacher:\no For COVID-19, a “close contact” is anyone who was within 6 feet of an\ninfected person for a total of 15 minutes or more.\nAs students and teachers are using masks and social distancing, it does not\nappear that CDC guidelines support the complainant’s belief that all students\nfrom a classroom should be quarantined when their teacher tests positive.\n The facility does not have a policy outside of the licensing rule regarding\nsupervision of youth in isolation. Specifically, the facility does not have a\npolicy about coverage during situations such as the one in this incident.\nHowever, the CA reported staff were aware of the expectation to provide\ncoverage.\n4",
    " The facility provided a summary of their internal investigation, as the incident\noccurred on 1/5/21. The summary concluded the following:\no In person room checks were not completed from 3:01 PM- 4:20 PM\nand again from 4:53 PM- 5:16 PM.\no Surveillance video confirmed that facility control room staff manned the\ncameras and completed visual checks of an individual in isolation for\nsuicide/self-harm precautions, and two new youth in isolation for\nmedical/COVID precautions.\no The paper form, documenting the times of checks, was not completed\nby control room staff.\no Upon realizing that checks may not have been completed, Staff 1\nchecked all three isolated youth and properly documented it.\no All staff have received re-training on proper incident response, room\ncheck procedures and documentation.\no The Chief Administrator noted this was the first incident of this kind at\nthe facility and he believes their swift and decisive steps to correct the\nproblem will ensure that it will not happen again.\n The isolation room log was reviewed and found to be missing staff checks as\ndescribed in the facility summary.\nFoster Care Workers\nThe foster care workers for the youth in isolation were contacted and reported to be\naware of the incident, and did not have any concerns.\nStaff 1\nOn 3/4/21 Staff 1 was interviewed by phone. Staff 1 reported being present during\nthe incident. Staff 1 was in a meeting that day when staff called for assistance\nregarding a youth at the facility. Staff 1 left the meeting and assisted in the situation.\nStaff 1 reported spending a lot of time talking with the youth, trying to deescalate him\nto avoid a restraint. Staff 1 stated it took about two hours to achieve their goal and\nhave the youth back to a regulated emotional state. During this incident, one staff\nwas called from the control room to switch with Staff 1. Staff 1 then went to the\ncontrol room and completed visual checks of the three rooms with youth in isolation.\nStaff 1 spoke with all three youth and found no concerns. It was at that time Staff 1\nrealized that the room check log had not been completed. Staff 1 was unsure if the\nprior staff completed checks and forgot to document them, or if the checks were\nmissed all together. Staff 1 documented on the sheet that the checks were missed\ndue to the incident in the other unit which required additional staff. Staff 1 noted that\nshe documented her checks, then called a supervisor to come in from home to\nassist. By 6:00 everything was back on track.\nStaff 1 stated that as soon as she realized checks were missing, she notified the\nChief Administrator and Family Court Administrator. Administration completed an\ninternal review and determined that they had to change the COVID procedures, by\nbringing all supervisors and clinicians back to the building, rather than continue\n5",
    "having them work from home. A review of the incident has since been completed\nwith all staff. All staff were also retrained on the requirement for checks when\nresidents are in seclusion.\nStaff 1 reported that there is not a specific policy/procedure for coverage during an\nincident such as what happened. Generally, the assistant supervisor would\ncoordinate coverage and make sure everything was taken care of. However, the\nassistant supervisor (Staff 2) on duty was new to the facility and still learning\nprocesses. Staff 1 stated that some staff tried to step in and do what they thought\nthey should do, but they really needed to have supervisor coordination. Staff 1\nclarified that staff completed checks via camera during the time staff were not doing\nface to face checks, but they did not document the times they were completed. Staff\n1 believes that staff have now learned the meaning of, “if it’s not documented, it\ndidn’t happen”.\nStaff 2\nOn 3/4/21 Staff 2 was interviewed by phone. Staff 2 reported that she was hired in\nJuly 2020 and began the afternoon shift in November 2020. Staff 2 reported being\npresent during the incident and noted this was only the second time she has been\ninvolved in something like this. Shortly after shift change, around 2:30pm, there was\na call for additional staff to assist with an escalated youth. Several staff went to\nassist. Staff 2 reported that the incident lasted approximately two hours.\nWhen asked about checks being completed Staff 2 stated that she has learned from\nthis incident that she needs to be more direct to ensure everything is covered.\nTypically, two staff would be left on the detention side of the facility when additional\nstaff are called to the residential side. In this incident, remaining staff were unaware\nthat they were responsible to complete the checks for the youth in isolation. Staff 2\nstated that she has learned that she needs to designate this responsibility in the\nfuture.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10175 Resident confinement room; procedures for use.\n(6) During a resident's confinement, visual observations of\nthe resident shall be made by staff at least every 15\nminutes. Each contact shall be logged at the time of the\nobservation.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: Information gathered from the complainant, chief administrator\nand additional staff confirmed that three youth in isolation did\nnot have documented checks completed every 15 minutes.\nWhile the facility has surveillance footage to show the youth\nwere being supervised, the visual observations were not\ndocumented as required by this rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\nMarch 16, 2021\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 16, 2021\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
