    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Sufficiency of staff.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Alleged sexual contact between unidentified youths implying\ninadequate supervision.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI left a voice message for Complainant on 4/1/24 and received a\ncall back on 4/2/24 identifying Youth A as the source of the\nallegations.\nI contacted Youth A’s Foster Care Worker and notified her of the\ninvestigation assignment. She had no additional licensing\nconcerns to report.\nINCIDENT 1:\nI interviewed Youth A on 4/2/24 at school. He said he was\nadmitted to Wolverine Center on 3/6/24 and has had multiple\nother placements. Youth A described one incident on an unknown\ndate where he said Former Youth J touched his “backside and\nhips.” He said this occurred in the community bathroom while\nStaff 1 was monitoring both youths at the bathroom door. Youth A\nsaid Staff 1 guided Former Youth J out of the bathroom when he\nheard Youth A cursing at Former Youth J.\nFormer Youth J is cognitively impaired and was discharged to his\nmother’s home in March 2024.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the school. He has worked at the facility\nfor two months. Staff 1 recalled Youth A was showering, and\nFormer Youth J asked to go in and use the toilet. “I let him use\nthe bathroom.” Staff 1 stood at the bathroom door and heard\nYouth J washing his hands. He momentarily turned his attention\nto another youth outside the bathroom. “I heard Youth A ask,\n2",
    "‘What are you doing?’ I told Former Youth J to leave out and he\nleft on his own. Afterward, Youth A seemed upset and told me\nFormer Youth J was looking at him…I did not see Former Youth J\ntouch Youth A sexually.”\nINCIDENT 2\nYouth A noted a second incident on 4/1/24 where Youth E tried to\nenter his room and threatened to “fuck and rape” him. “Staff 2\nstopped him.”\nI interviewed Youth E on 4/2/24 at the facility. He is placed in the\nshort-term shelter program and had only been there for four days.\nYouth E denied threatening to sexually assault Youth A.\nStaff 2’s employment was terminated on 4/12/24. I attempted to\ninterview him by phone on 4/21/24 but his number was out of\nservice.\nVideo:\nVideo of the second-floor hallway on 4/1/24 shows Staff 2\nsupervising the hallway.\nAnalysis It cannot be determined if Former Youth J touched Youth A’s hips\nand backside in the bathroom. However, both Youth A and Staff 1\nsaid Staff 1 was at the bathroom door supervising.\nIt cannot be determined if Youth E verbally threatened to rape\nYouth A on 4/1/24. However, Youth A reported, and video footage\nconfirmed that staff were supervising the area when the alleged\nthreat occurred.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Facility and premises maintenance\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4407\nSection (3) The facility, including main and accessory structures, shall be\nDescription maintained so as to prevent and eliminate rodent and insect\nharborage.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\n3",
    "Allegation Allegedly there are bugs and cockroaches in building and mice in\nbasement.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth A said on 3/9/24 he found a dead mouse in the basement\nbathroom, flushed it down the toilet and informed an unidentified\nstaff. He has also seen ants in the basement and on the main\nfloor.\nYouth E said he has not noticed any bugs, mice or cockroaches in\nthe building.\nTour Observation:\nI observed the basement on 3/28/24 and did not see any mice or\ninsects.\nConsultant 2 toured the building on 3/28/24 and also did not see\nany mice or insects.\nDocuments reviewed:\nAn Interim Inspection Report dated 7/31/23 indicates the facility\npassed an environmental health inspection on 7/28/23 with an A\nrating.\nI reviewed Orkin receipts for services rendered. On 2/17/24, the\nbuilding was treated for bedbugs and billed $8500. On 3/6/24,\nstandard monthly insecticides were applied for a charge of $95.99.\nAnalysis When the building was toured on 3/28/24 there was not any\nevidence of an insect or mice infestation. Documentation shows\nWolverine Center has an exterminator who applies insecticides on\na monthly basis.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 21, 2024\n4",
