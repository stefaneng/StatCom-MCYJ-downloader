    "Allegation A staff member was in the role of a LPC and was providing\ntherapy services without being licensed in the State of Michigan.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nMDHHS Worker/Complaint Source was interviewed via phone\non July 31, 2023. MDHHS Worker reported she completed her\ncontract evaluation for the facility on July 9, 2023, and found\nTherapist to not be a licensed therapist in the State of Michigan.\nShe reported Therapist is licensed through the State of Virginia\nand Clinical Supervisor was helping assist to get his license active\nin the State of Michigan. MDHHS Worker reported Therapist has\nbeen employed at the facility for a couple of years. She stated that\nshe did not review the job description for the position. MDHHS\nWorker reported when she talked with Clinical Supervisor, he\nreported he was working on changing the policy and procedure to\nensure this does not happen again. MDHHS Worker reported she\nnever saw the original policy surrounding the requirements for the\ntherapist role and has asked for it but never received it. She\nreported she spoke with Clinical Supervisor today who reported\nthey are still working with the State of Michigan to get Therapist’s\nlicense active in this state but as of now it is still pending.\nCurrently Therapist is not providing therapy to the youth as of\ntoday. MDHHS Worker reported a complaint is also being filed\nwith the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs\n(LARA).\nClinical Supervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility\non August 1, 2023. Clinical Supervisor reported Therapist was\nhired in April 2019 due to meeting the job requirements for the\nresidential therapist. He reported the residential therapist\nrequirements include a master’s degree and eligibility to obtain a\nprofessional license in the State of Michigan. Clinical Supervisor\nreported Therapist has an LPC license in the State of Virginia\nwhich made him meet the requirement that he is eligible in the\nState of Michigan since he has one in another state. He reported it\nwas reported that at the start of employment, Therapist worked\nwith the State of Michigan to get his license open in Michigan.\nClinical Supervisor reported since Therapist was licensed by the\nCommonwealth of Virginia, he could apply for licensure by\nendorsement which he did and had an application submitted.\nClinical Supervisor reported when the facility had their contract\naudit completed by MDHHS Worker and she noted the lack of\nlicensure was found, Therapist talked with the State of Michigan\nLicensing and completed an application as he was told his\napplication was old. Clinical Supervisor reported he has had\nformal monthly supervision and informal weekly supervision with\nTherapist. Since the finding of the concern with licensure\n2",
    "Therapist stopped providing therapy while getting the license\nsituated. Clinical supervisor reported there was no policy or\nprocedure in place about tracking staff’s licensures, so this was\ncreated in response. A form was also created to be used yearly to\ntrack annual training responsibility, monthly supervision, and\nlicensure requirements by the Clinical Supervisor.\nLARA Worker was interviewed via phone on August 1,\n2023. State of Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA)\nwas contacted to speak about the requirements for the transition\nof an LPC license from one state to Michigan. LARA Worker\nreported Therapist would need to submit an application to\ntransition the license and follow that protocol. She reported the\nshort answer is a person should not be practicing therapy in a\nstate unless they are licensed by that state whether it be fully\nlicensed or limited licensed. LARA Worker reported she was\nunsure about a therapist working at a Child Caring Institution\nrequirements as they do not get billed from insurance directly\nwhich is where a therapist needs to be licensed by the State of\nMichigan. She also reported due to COVID-19 there were some\nexceptions made to allow people to practice with another state\nlicense in Michigan due to the need for mental health services and\nthe barriers the pandemic put on getting paperwork processed in a\ntimely manner. LARA Worker reported there was an application in\nApril 2019 for Therapist to transfer his license and then another\none just recently in July 2023.
