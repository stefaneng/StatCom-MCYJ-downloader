INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12505\nSection (2) An agency shall provide the following minimum supervision:\nDescription (b) At monthly intervals, ensure that the youth is complying with\nthe terms of the contract required by R 400.12510, continues to\nreside in a safe and acceptable environment, and is managing\nexpenditures.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statue Violation.\nType\nAllegation Youth A disclosed that she does not feel safe in the home due to\nyoung men are allowed to enter the premises freely.\nInvestigation Complainant/Complaint document\nOn 10/7/2022 I reviewed the complaint and attempted contact with\nthe complainant.\nThe complaint indicated Youth A stated she does not feel safe\nbecause young men are allowed to enter the premises and roam\nfreely. Additionally, that the young men hang around outside the\nfacility, and proposition the youths to get into their vehicles as the\nyouths leave or are outside the facility. The complaint did not\nindicate how Youth A knew this or when it had occurred.\nDHHS Worker XX\nOn 10/7/2022 I spoke with the Department of Health and Human\nServices (DHHS) Worker XX by telephone. DHHS Worker XX is\nnot an assigned worker on this complaint. DHHS Worker XX\ncontacted me related to the complaint in an attempt to obtain\ninformation related to the extent of the complaint. She shared\n3",
    "information about her connection to the agency. She reported that\nshe/her county received an email from another county office\nadvising her/them that county had completed an emergency\nreplacement of a youth they had placed at this Independent Living\n(IL) facility; and advising DHHS Worker XX’s county’s office their\nyouth may have safety issues at the facility.\nDHHS Worker XX reported she completed an unannounced onsite\nto the facility related to Youth B. DHHS Worker XX reported she\nobserved the independent living (IL) house to be “okay, no clutter,\nno dishes in the sink; no men hanging around outside”. She\nreported the agency indicated they installed cameras and other\nwindows because Youth B snuck someone into the home. She\nreported speaking with Youth B and Youth B reported she feels\nsafe in this placement. DHHS Worker XX provided me a copy of\nfour photos (kitchen, living room, another outer area and Youth\nB’s bed room) she took of the IL house, which showed no areas of\nconcern.\nService Worker X\nOn 10/10/2022 I interviewed Youth A’s DHHS worker, Service\nWorker X by telephone. Service Worker X reported information in\nthis complaint came out during a court hearing attended by the\nagency and Youth A on 9/28/2022. Service Worker X reported an\nemergency hearing was held on Friday (9/30/2022) at which time\nthe court ordered Youth A’s replacement that occurred that day.\nService Worker X denied Youth A having special needs of a\ncognitive nature.\nService Worker X said she received a call from the attorney\ngeneral (AG) on 10/6/2022 with instructions to explore the matter.\nService Worker X reported the court was upset after Youth A\nreported she was being bullied at school, was not in therapy and\nthat reportedly the agency had done nothing about it. Additionally,\nthat Youth A reported that men were hanging around outside the\nhome when Youth A and other youths left for school, and the men\nwere propositioning them. Furthermore, that despite the youth\ntelling the agency about the latter issue, the agency had done\nnothing about the issue. Another issue was that there are mice in\nthe home.\nService Worker X reported a meeting occurred with the agency on\n10/6/2022. The agency denied men hanging around the IL home.\nThe agency indicated that men in cars have driven by the house;\nand some may have blown their horn after seeing a youth outside,\nbut no men were propositioning the youths. Service Worker X\n4",
    "was not sure what the agency were doing or had done related to\nthe issue of mice being seen in the home.\nYouth A\nI made several attempts to contact Youth A about these\nallegations without success.\nOnsite Agency Visit and Interviews\nOn 10/14/2022 I interviewed Youth C, Case Manager 3,\nIndependent Living (IL) Site Worker 4 and IL Site worker 5 onsite\nrelated to the allegations of mice, and of men hanging round the\nhome creating safety issues.\nDuring this onsite visit, I also attempted to interview Youth B; and I\ncompleted a tour of the facility.\nYouth B\nYouth B refused to talk with me. Nor would Youth B report\nwhether she did or did not feel safe at the facility.\nYouth C:\nYouth C reported being in placement at the agency for\napproximately five months. She reported she had denied the Orkin\npeople access to her room, because they come at 9:00am or\n10:00am and she is sleeping. She reported to have caught mice\non a sticky track that was in her room. Youth C did not know how\nlong ago that was. She has not seen any mice in her room or\nother parts of the home since that time. Youth C added that she\ndoes not leave her room much.\nYouth C reported there had been two or three men hanging\naround outside. Youth C said that was about one month ago and\nit had been one male person at a time, at different times, not\nmultiple males together. She reported the male persons had been\nthere for Youth B, and all had occurred before the agency installed\nthe camera’s outside in September 2022. Youth C reported no\nmen/males have been around since that time. She reported\nknowing the male persons were there for Youth B, because Youth\nB talked about it, and when Youth B would go outside the male\nperson would be there. Youth C said she also knew the male\nperson was there for Youth B because Youth B had snuck a boy,\n“not a man” in the house more than once. Youth C reported it was\nnot that hard to sneak a person inside without staff’s knowledge,\nbecause of where the stairs leading upstairs are located with\nrespect to the front door; as well as, where a downstairs bedroom\nis located. Youth C reported seeing more than one boy in the\n5",
    "home that Youth B had snuck into Youth B’s room. Youth C\nreported not telling staff about this at first, but eventually doing so\nbecause she realized it could be unsafe for males to be in the\nhome. Youth C denied any males that Youth B had snuck into the\nhome ever talking with her or coming to her room. Youth C\nreported other than the staff talking with Youth B, nothing else\noccurred, that she was aware of. Youth C was not aware of\nwhether staff had ever caught a male person in the house.\nAgency Staff\nAll the staff interviewed admitted there had been an issue with\nmice in the past and that the agency was or had addressed it. All\nthese staff reported Orkin visited the home regularly; and that any\ninfestations that had occurred was due to a lack of cleanliness by\nthe youths, despite the youths being encouraged to clean up after\nthemselves.\nCase Manager 3:\nCase Manager 3 reported there are currently only two youths in\nthe program. Youth A had been the third youth, and Youth A was\nordered replaced from the IL home on 9/30/2022 based\napparently on inaccurate information reported by Youth A to the\ncourt on 9/28/2022. Case Manager 3 reported being in\nattendance at that court hearing, but not being able to address the\ncourt to explain the issues Youth A reported. Each time she tried\nshe said she was cut off. She reported the agency was not aware\nthere would be an emergency replacement until 9/30/2022. Case\nManager 3 reported at the next hearing on 10/13/2022, she was\nable to give feedback and explain.\nCase Manager 3 reported Orkin was at the home most recently on\n10/7/2022 around 2:00pm and Youth C refused to allow Orkin into\nher room. She reported the pest issue had already been\naddressed prior to this complaint issue.\nCase Manager 3 denied ever witnessing men anywhere outside\naround the house. She reported asking her staff about this issue\nand the staff had not seen any men as well. If there were men\nhanging around, she said she and the staff would call the police.\nShe reported that on 9/22/2022, she met with the youths one-to-\none; after Youth C reported to a staff that there had been a man in\nthe house. Case Manager 3 said each youth knows it is against\nthe rules to have men/people in the house; and her meeting with\nthem was to again advise them of the rule, and possible safety\nissues, and consequences attached to that. Case Manager 3\nreported Youth A had also reported a youth had snuck a male into\n6",
    "the home. Case Manager 3 said Youth A reported that she told\nthe youth (name not reported) it was not cool to have men in the\nhome. Youth A would not report how the person got into the home\nor whether she had assistance in any way; only that the person\nleft while the staff (name was not disclosed) was in the bathroom.\nCase Manager 3 reported that it had it only been the one incident\nshe was aware of, but Youth C said this type of thing happened\ntwice. Case Manager 3 reported not knowing if that information by\nYouth C was accurate, because Youth C was upset with Youth B\nat the time Youth C reported it. Case Manager 3 reported the\nalleged incident had taken place on the third shift. Reportedly, the\nboy Youth B had at the house left, and a second person, (who\nwas the ride to the boy who had come to the home) had come to\nthe home separately. Reportedly, the latter boy had come to pick\nup the other boy, not knowing the boy had left the home. A safety\nplan was done after that incident related to the one-to-one\nmeeting with the youths, continued room checks by staff, and the\ncameras installed outside.\nSite Worker 4 and Site Worker 5\nSite Worker 4 reported working primarily first shift (7:00am-\n3:00pm) and Site Worker 5 works second shift 3:00pm-11:00pm.\nBoth site workers reported information about the pest issue as\nindicated earlier in this section.\nSite Worker 4 reported Youth A never mentioned anything to her\nabout men hanging around outside the house or being allowed\ninside the house. Site Worker 4 said men are not allowed in the\nhome. She reported that some time in July 2022 Youth B alleged\nthat Youth A had allowed a male into the home, but Site Worker 4\ndenied ever seeing a male in the home. Nor of any other youth\nreporting such an incident to her. Site Worker 4 reported that prior\nto this complaint the agency used to have outside cameras to\nsurvey the area, but the cameras died, and Program Director 2\nnever replaced the cameras until about two weeks ago.\nSite Worker 5 reported she learned about an incident of Youth B\nsneaking a male into the home about three weeks ago. She said\nthe incident occurred on a Tuesday around 8:00pm during a\nsecond shift that she did not work. Site Worker 5 was not sure\nwhether the male person was caught by staff or if staff learned\nabout the matter after the fact. Site Worker 5 was not aware of\nanother incident of a male person being in the home. She reported\nwhat Case Manager 3 had about a second male coming to the\nhouse on the day of the first incident. This second male person\nhad come onto the porch and pulled on the door knob and left.\n7",
    "Program Director 2\nOn 10/17/2022 I spoke with Program Director (PD) 2 by telephone\nand had email correspondences with him on 10/7/2022 and\n10/14/2022 about the allegations. PD 2 reported Samaritas along\nwith Orkin has placed extra traps down related to the mice issue.\nHe reported the agency has a plan in place whereby Orkin visits\nthe home monthly to address any pest issues. This system has\nbeen in place for quite some time. He reported recent service\ndates of 7/1/2022, 7/7/2022, 8/1/2022, 9/9/2022 and 10/7/2022.\nThere was also past documentation showing services in April,\nMay and June 2022.\nPD 2 reported that since the agency’s last investigation they have\nplaced cameras outside the home to survey the area and help\nwith safety monitoring. Additionally, they continue to talk with the\nyouths about inviting males over, because such visits are against\nthe IL home’s rules. The staff are encouraged to provided greater\nchecks of/about the home.\nReviewed:\nDocumentation showing the home was sprayed/inspected for\npest on:\n• 4/1/2022, 4/5/2022, 6/5/2022, 6/8/2022, 7/1/2022, 7/7/2022;\n8/1/2022; 9/9/2022 and 10/7/2022 as indicated by PD 2.\nToured the IL home on 10/14/2022.\nNo rodents/pest were observed in the home at that time. Aside\nfrom the bathrooms and one of the youths’ bedrooms needing\ncleaning, no major concerns were observed. The outside cameras\nthat staff reported had been installed were seen.\nAnalysis The agency was addressing and continues to address issues\nrelated to pests in the home, which was due partly to youths\nleaving food in their rooms/about the home, and not cleaning up\nbehind themselves. At the time of the tour there was no evidence\nof rodents or pests, and the facility was basically clean.\nAdditionally, the matter of men hanging around the home relates\nto at least one youth sneaking a boy into the home; a matter that\nwas addressed with that youth and other youths in the home.\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the allegations or the\nhome/environment being unsafe.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\n8",
    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statue Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency has not offered supportive services to the youth. The\nyouth has been at the facility for 6 months and has not had any\ntherapy. The agency is not looking into relatives as placements.\nInvestigation On 10/7/2022 I reviewed the complaint and attempted contact with\nthe complainant.\nService Worker X\nOn 10/10/2022 I spoke with Youth A’s DHHS worker, Service\nWorker X by telephone. Service Worker X reported information in\nthis complaint came out during a court hearing attended by the\nagency and Youth A on 9/28/2022. Service Worker X said she\nreceived a call from the attorney general (AG) on 10/6/2022 with\ninstructions to explore the matter. Service Worker X reported the\ncourt was upset after Youth A reported she was being bullied at\nschool, was not in therapy and that reportedly the agency had\ndone nothing about it.\nService Worker X reported Youth A was supposed to be in\ntherapy but was not. Service Worker X reported the agency\nindicated they tried to provide Youth A with services, but Youth A\nwas resistant. The agency reported they tried to put Youth A in\ntherapy, but Youth A kept refusing to attend and the agency gave\nno other particulars related the therapy matter.\nService Worker X reported the agency was also supposed to be\nassisting with sibling visits or providing bus tickets but did not\nappear to be doing so. For transportation, the agency reported\nproviding bus tickets. Service Worker X reported that Youth A\nwanted a direct drive provided by agency staff.\nYouth A\nI made several attempts to contact Youth A about these\nallegations without success.\n9",
    "Onsite Agency Visit and Interviews\nOn 10/14/2022 I interviewed Youth C, Case Manager 3 (who I\nalso had email correspondence with on 10/12/2022), Independent\nLiving (IL) Site Worker 4 and IL Site worker 5, onsite related to the\nallegations. I also attempted to interview Youth B. On 10/17/2022,\nI spoke with Program Director (PD) 2 by telephone and had email\ncorrespondences with him on 10/7/2022 and 10/14/2022 about the\nallegations.\nYouth B\nYouth B refused to talk with me about the allegations.\nRE: School bulling:\nYouth C\nYouth C reported she attends school online. She reported\nknowing at some point that Youth A attended school in the\ncommunity, but Youth C was not aware of Youth A being bullied at\nschool. Youth A never mentioned being bullied. Youth C said,\nYouth A told her boys at school were trying to talk with her, and\nYouth A reported not wanting to be bothered with the boys.\nYouth C said Youth A had mentioned the latter to a staff person,\nbut Youth C did not know what staff person Youth A had\nmentioned that to; nor when, or what, if any suggestions were\nadvised by the staff person.\nCase Manager 3\nCase Manager 3 denied Youth A ever speaking with her about\nbeing bullied at school. Case Manager 3 said Youth A did not\nwant to go to school; and staff would report Youth A would not get\nup for school. Case Manager 3 said Youth A gave numerous\nreasons for not getting up and going to school. Case Manager 3\nreported Youth A’s first day of school was on 9/14/2022. She\nreported in the two-week period between 9/14/2022 and\n9/30/2022 (when Youth A left the IL home), Youth A only went to\nschool four days. Case Manager 3 reported trying to talk with\nYouth A about school, and what if anything was going on. She\nsaid, Youth A’s comments about the school were that it was\n“ghetto,” she did not like the school, it was chaotic, and the\nteachers did not have control of the classrooms. Case Manager 3\nreported at some unspecified time, Youth A reported a boy was\nbothering or touching her on her first day of school. Youth A would\nnot provide details as to what that meant; and Youth A had not\nreported that on her first day of school. Case Manager 3 said\nYouth A’s comments came out a little bit at a time over the two-\nweek period. Case Manager 3 said Youth A would not answer the\n10",
    "explorative questions she asked and would walk away. Case\nManager 3 advised that Youth A also had a computer, and even if\nshe was not physically going to class, Youth A could go online and\ndo schoolwork, but Youth A did not. The school reported Youth A\nwas not completing work online as required.\nCase Manager 3 reported trying to make contact with the school\nabout Youth A’s hours, whether she was being bullied and how\nYouth A was doing. On 9/30/2022, she connected with the school\nprincipal. The principal reported at no time had Youth A reported\nbeing bullied or that anything had happened at school. The\nprincipal reported running a tight ship; no students are allowed to\nroam about. That outside of one incident of fighting and one\nstudent being caught vaping (not Youth A), there have been no\nnoted school issues.\nSite Worker 4 and Site Worker 5\nSite Worker 4 reported not knowing of a time Youth A was being\nbullied at school. She said Youth A was only in school about 10\ndays during the school year, prior to Youth A leaving the program.\nSite Worker 4 said she took Youth A for five of those days and\nYouth A was absent the rest of the days. She said Youth A\nrefused to take the bus or walk home, and Site Worker 4 would\nalso pick Youth A up from school. Site Worker 4 said Youth A\nnever reported being bullied or any school concerns.\nSite Worker 5 reported Youth A would periodically talk with her\nabout school. Youth A told her she did not like school and that\npeople at the school were bothering her, but Youth A gave no\ndetails. Youth A talked about being anxious about things in\ngeneral and being sexually active. Site Worker 5 reported\nspeaking with Case Manager 3 about what Youth A reported three\nor four times after the youths’ group sessions. Case Manager 3\nresponded that “we will try to look into that”. Site Worker 5\nreported Case Manager 3 spoke with Youth A and all the youths\nafter group. Site Worker 5 was not sure what came about those\ntalks with Youth A.\nProgram Director 2\nProgram Director 2 indicated the current case manager, Case\nManager 3 has worked extensively with the school, but Youth A\nand another youth in the home has refused to even go to school.\nHe did not report an awareness that Youth A was being bullied at\nschool or had reported such.\nRE: Therapy:\n11",
    "Youth C\nYouth C was not aware of whether Youth A was receiving or not\nreceiving therapy.\nCase Manager 3\nCase Manager 3 reported Youth A was not in therapy when Case\nManager 3 officially took over case manager in August 2022.\nCase Manager 3 reported there was a transfer meeting between\nshe and Case Manager 6 where it was reported that Case\nManager 6 attempted to get Youth A into therapy, but Youth A\ncancelled the intake appointment. Case Manager 3 denied Youth\nA reporting anxieties but admitted a staff (that person was not\nnamed) told her Youth A reported having anxieties. On\n9/28/2022, Case Manager 3 said she contacted Genesee Health\nCenter and made an appointment for 9/30/2022. On 9/30/2022,\nshe advised Youth A that she would be transporting Youth A to\nthe appointment. Youth A refused to go to the appointment and\ntold Case Manager 3 she did not care what Case Manager 3 did;\nshe was not going. Case Manager 3 cancelled the 9/30/2022\nappointment and rescheduled it for 10/3/2022. Case Manager 3\nreported this was all done before they knew Youth A was leaving\nthe program. She reported after Youth A’s emergency\nreplacement, she completed a JAC (Juvenile Assessment Center)\nreferral to assist with therapy in the new placement.\nSite Worker 4 and Site worker 5\nSite Worker 4 did not know if Youth A was or was not in therapy.\nSite Worker 5 reported that Youth A had reported being open to\ntherapy, but Youth A’s actions did not show that. Site Worker 5\nreported that when Case Manager 6 tried to set up therapy for\nYouth A, Youth A would say I don’t feel like it. Site Worker 5\nreported knowing this because it was reported to her. She said in\nAugust 2022 Case Manager 6 tried to get services set up via\nGenesee Health System, but they were not taking referrals at that\ntime. Site Worker 5 reporting knowing the latter, because she is\nthe one who called the community health care agency to get an\nintake appointment. She spoke with Case Manager 6 after the\ncall and Case Manager 6 advised they would have to find\nsomething else. Site Worker 5 was not aware of what happened\nafter that, or what Case Manager 3 followed up on.\nProgram Director 2\nPD 2 reported hearing from Case Manager 6 of Youth A being\nresistant to attending therapy, and not being willing to complete an\nintake. He indicated case service referrals for Hope Network and\n12",
    "Genesee Health System were completed by Case Manager 6 in\nSeptember 2022 and documented in MISACWIS. He provided a\ncopy of the 10/4/2022 referral to the JAC by Case Manager 3.\nRE: Transportation/Relative placement:\nYouth C\nYouth C reported knowing Youth A had asked about\ntransportation (she did not say how she knew that) to go see\nYouth A’s sister; but Youth C did not know whether the agency\nhad provided that transportation. Youth C affirmed that the\nagency provides bus tickets.\nCase Manager 3\nCase Manager 3 reported all youths that wish to go visit a family\nmember must first provide a name, phone number and address of\nthe person(s) they wish to see. She reported that Samaritas\nencourages family contact and visitation; but they must first look at\nthe youth’s safety related to anyone the youth seeks to visit.\nShe reported it was not until August 2022, while on a camping trip\nand again in September 2022 during a Life Skills Meeting that\nYouth A asked to get a weekend pass to visit someone down in\nthe Detroit area. Youth A refused to provide the name of the\nperson in Detroit. When Case Manager 3 pressed the matter with\nYouth A, Youth A still would not name the person she wanted to\nvisit but reported the person would not speak to Case Manager 3\nbecause “they hated Samaritas”. She told Youth A bus passes\ncould be provided and that Case Manager 3 would also help with\ntransportation. Youth A still did not provide an address until later in\nSeptember when Youth A gave her sister’s name and information\nand said she wanted to live with that sister.\nSite Worker 4 and Site worker 5\nBoth of these workers reported they were not aware of Youth A\never requesting transportation to visit a relative or anyone.\nSite Worker 4 reported Youth A having siblings, but she did recall\nYouth A visiting them and Site Worker 4 did not know why that\nwas.\nSite Worker 5 reported Youth A going on two to four overnight\nvisits during Youth A’s placement. Someone would pick up and\ndrop Youth A off. Site Worker 5 was not sure who those visits\nwere with as visits are approved by the IL case manager or\ndirector.\n13",
    "Youth A\nI made several attempts to contact Youth A via her sister, about\nthese allegations without success.\nProgram Director 2\nPD 2 reported whenever the agency gets placement of a youth\nfrom another region, they do not have a problem helping with\nyouth/relative visitation. They always provide a way for transport\nof a youth if the youth cannot find a way or if the relative cannot\npick up the youth. He reported the agency also teaches youths\nhow to get around on the bus. PD 2 was not certain whether the\nlatter had occurred with Youth A but surmised it likely had not. Nor\nthat Youth A would know how to catch the bus from Flint to Detroit\nwhere her sister resides. He reported therefore, the agency would\nhave had to coordinated that with Youth A and her sister. He\nreported the agency would have looked at purchasing a bus ticket\nfor her. He reported when Youth A first came into placement\nYouth A reported she did not get along with her relatives. Youth A\ndid not want or request relative visitation until the last couple of\nweeks in September 2022. He said Youth A had not engaged in\nthe IL program because Youth A did not want to be there.\nPD 2 reported the agency would only explore a relative placement\nwhen a youth was ready to transition to a relative placement,\nwhich had not been the situation prior to the emergency\nplacement removal. He said the agency never got that far with\nvisitation for Youth A or with a relative placement. He said DHHS\nwanted Youth A in IL placement and another Samaritas IL was to\npick up Youth A’s case. He reported not being sure why the\ncourt/DHHS did the emergency placement removal, noting that\nthe court placed Youth A with her sister without a full assessment.\nSamaritas followed up and completed that assessment.\nReviewed\nYouth A’s MISACWIS case which showed:\n• She is a temporary court ward. She was placed in this\nagency’s IL home on 6/16/2022 until 9/30/2022, with her\nofficial discharge listed in MISACWIS as 10/4/2022.\n• Agency court report from Samaritas dated 8/5/2022\ncompleted by Case Manager 6 for Youth A that indicated:\n➢ “A relative search was conducted by the previous\nplacement prior to the move but no fit and willing\nrelatives were located”. That it is in the youth’s best\ninterest to remain in her current placement as\nadoption is no longer an appropriate permanency\nplan.\n14",
    "➢ Youth A verbalized she would like therapy services\nwhen she first came into the independent living\nplus- ILP program but Youth A has since decided\nshe does not need therapy. Youth would not make\nthe initial intake call with the worker because she\ndid not want to participate in therapy services.\n• Updated service plan 4/18/2022-7/16/2022 completed by\nAgency Z, the youth’s prior placement agency, that\nindicated:\n➢ Samaritas and Youth A would contact community\nmental health to begin therapy.\n• A MISACWIS service provider need/referral for Hope\nNetwork for 9/20/2022 through 10/14/2022; Genesee\nCounty Community Health for 9/20/2022 and Assured\nFamily Services for 10/5/2022.\n• Updated service plan 7/17/2022- 10/14/2022 completed by\nSamaritas that indicated:\n➢ Towards the end of this reporting period Youth A\nhad struggled with her emotional behavior coping\nskills. The previous case manager made two intake\nreferrals to Hope Network and Genesee Health\nSystem (GHS) during that time. Hope Network only\nhad a wait list and GHS was only taking patients\nwith established psychiatric conditions. During that\ntime Youth A did not want to participate in\ncounseling but later changed her mind. Due to\nYouth A’s emergency removal from the IL-Plus\nhome, a JAC referral was submitted to Wayne\nCounty Assured Family Services for Counseling.\nOn 10/4/2022, the Program Manger met with Youth\nA at her new IL placement, and she expressed\nagain that she did not want to participate in\ncounseling. The Program manager counseled Youth\nA on the importance of participating in counseling\nand Youth A finally agreed that she will participate.\nAnalysis Based the interviews and other evidence reviewed there is\ninsufficient evidence to support that the agency did not seek to\nobtain services for Youth A. Nor that the agency did not work with\nthe youth and other relevant individuals for the development,\nimplementation, and review of service plans for children and their\nfamilies.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is recommended that the agency keep better detailed records of\nthe dates that services, such as therapy referrals and\n15",
    "transportation assistance, are provided and offered to a youth,\nand when a youth refuses or misses those services, as well.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date March 6, 2023\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 20, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n16"
