    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 2/6/22, a staff member performed an improper restraint on a youth that was\nattempting to self-harm.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/11/22 a complaint was received from the facility indicating on 2/6/22 Staff 1\nwas called to assist with Youth A. While Staff 2 was de-escalating another youth\nStaff 1 was attempting to de-escalate Youth A in the milieu. Youth A was holding a\nplastic cup that she had broken into pieces. Staff 1 asked Youth A to give him the\npieces because they had sharp edges. Youth A refused to give them up. Youth A\nswung at Staff 1 with the sharp pieces. Staff 1 then conducted an unapproved wrist\nhold on Youth A to keep her from stabbing him with the broken plastic. Staff 1 held\nYouth A’s wrists across the front of her body while he stood in front of her. This\nlasted about 15-20 minutes. Youth A calmed and was released. Staff 1 contacted\nthe on-call who instructed Staff 1 to complete an incident report.\nInterviews:\nThe Manager of Program Operations (Manager) was interviewed via telephone on\n2/14/22. He stated he filed out the complaint form after talking to their consultant. He\nstated it was Thursday or Friday that he submitted it. He was informed about the\nhold on Monday 2/7/22 but the hold occurred the previous weekend. Staff 1\ncontacted the clinician on-call who told him to complete an incident report. Staff 1\ncompleted an ABC (Antecedents, Behavior, Consequences) form instead. He\nthought an incident report was completed and put in MiSACWIS. They have had\nsome concerns with Staff 1. He is currently being investigated for another incident.\nThey have already determined that he needs additional verbal de-escalation and\nrestraint training. He will not be involved in restraints until he is re-trained. Staff 1\nwas alone with the youth. Staff 2 was at the other end of the hallway working with\nanother escalated child. The Assistant Program Manager (APM) was in the building\nat the time. The Manager was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/15/22. He\nwas unable to locate an Incident Report.\nOn 2/15/22 an interview was attempted with Youth A at her school. When Youth A\ncame out of her classroom she ran around the building and would not return to be\ninterviewed. Another attempt was made on 2/25/22 however Youth A had left for a\nvisit.\nThe Assistant Program Manager (APM) was interviewed face to face at the facility\non 2/15/22. The APM worked the Sunday night Staff 1 restrained Youth A, but she\nwas never informed of the containment until the following Tuesday when she was\nasked what happened. She reported she should have been notified of the\ncontainment as she was the manager in the building. There is also a different\nmanager on-call.\n3",
    "The Chief Administrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/15/22. She\nreported Staff 1 has been re-trained in Handle with Care because the youth were\ngetting out of his holds. He does well with the youth and builds relationships with\nthem.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/18/22. He reported during the\nincident on 2/6/22 there were only two staff working that were trained in Handle with\nCare. He worked with Youth A while the other trained staff worked with Youth B.\nYouth A had a plastic cup that she broke into pieces. She would not give him the\npieces and tried stabbing him with them. When she went to stab him, Staff 1 held\nher wrists. He let go right away but she continued to try and stab him. He grabbed\nher wrists again. He sat down with her, she de-escalated, and gave him the pieces\nof plastic so he let her go. He stated he did not want to do the Handle With Care\nhold because she would use the pieces to stab his sides. Staff 1 reported that in a\nprevious training they are taught to back away from a youth coming at them, but she\nwas also trying to stab herself, so he did not want to do that. He stated he could\nhave called another staff to assist. Staff 1 stated he met with the Manager to go over\nthe incident and he was re-trained in Handle With Care. Staff 1 acknowledged that\nholding Youth A’s wrists was not a technique taught in Handle With Care.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/25/22. She reported she was\npresent for the incident on 2/6/22 with Youth A. She stated she was trying to calm\nanother youth when Staff 1 was addressing Youth A. Youth A had a broken cup in\nher hand and was cutting herself. Staff 2 was not present for the entire incident, but\nshe did see that Staff 1 was holding Youth A's arms. Staff 1 was sitting on the floor\nwith Youth A and was not going to release her until she let go of the cup pieces.\nStaff 2 could not see exactly how Staff 1 was holding Youth A's arms. Staff 2 then\nwent to get help.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Youth A’s Case file: Youth A has a developmental disability. She is physically\naggressive towards others and threatens to hurt herself. She is easily\nagitated.\n MiSACWIS Incident Reports: No report was found for 2/6/22.\n Incident Report: the report was not completed until after the on-site visit on\n2/15/22. The report had the same information that was in the complaint and\nStaff 1’s interview.\n ABC Form: Indicated the same information as the Incident Report.\n Resident Restraint Policy: Staff are only to utilize Handle With Care\ntechniques, an Incident Report must be completed before the end of the shift,\na manager must be notified of the restraint, and the restraint must be entered\ninto MiSACWIS within 24 hours.\n Handle With Care training materials: the technique Staff 1 indicated using on\nYouth A was not one of the techniques outlined in the materials.\n4",
    " Incident Reporting policy\n Staff 1 employee file: He completed Handle With Care training on 10/20/21\nand 2/10/22. Staff 1 had a discipline in his file from 2/16/22 for not completing\nan Incident Report as instructed for the incident on 2/6/22.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures regarding restraint. These\npolicies and procedures shall be available to all\nresidents, their families, and referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: The agency is found in non-compliance as Staff 1 did not follow\nthe facility’s restraint policy. He performed a technique not\ntaught by Handle With Care, he did not complete an incident\nreport until 2/15/22, he did not notify the manager in the\nbuilding, and because the incident report was not completed it\nwas not entered into MiSACWIS.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe Incident Reporting policy needs to direct staff to contact\nCentral Intake if they suspect abuse/neglect.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that no\nchange be made to the license status of this Child Caring Institution.\n3/5/2022\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 7, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
