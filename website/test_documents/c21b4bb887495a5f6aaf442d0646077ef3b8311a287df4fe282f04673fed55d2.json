    "Investigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker by phone on 03/012/2025.\nFoster Care Worker confirmed completing the initial service plan\nfor the time period 01/10/2025 to 02/06/2025 on 02/06/2025.\nFoster Care Worker reported the family had submitted an\napplication for approval/inclusion with a recognized Native\nAmerican Tribe, but a determination had not yet been received\nregarding the application.

A PATP for the parents was signed by the\nworker 02/06/2025 with a notation the parents refused to sign.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance per the interviews that were\ncompleted and the documents that were reviewed. The date of\nassumption for this case was 1/10/2025 and the 30-day time\nperiod would require the Initial Service Plan to be completed by\n02/09/2025 and it was completed 02/06/2025.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans.\nSection • (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents\nDescription and the foster parents in the development of service plans\nto enable the parent or parents and foster parents to\nunderstand the plan for the child and the parents' and the\nfoster parent's role in assisting the agency in carrying out\n2",
