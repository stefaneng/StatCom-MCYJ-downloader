    "summary": "An investigation into allegations of physical abuse and verbal abuse at Eagle Village, a child caring institution, found the claims to be unsubstantiated. The report examined claims that a youth was dragged by staff and that staff used racial slurs and derogatory language, but witness accounts were contradictory, video evidence was unavailable or did not support the claims, and the facility's documented policies were deemed adequate. Ultimately, the state investigator concluded the facility was in compliance with all rules, placing responsibility for the unproven allegations on inconsistent and uncorroborated reporting rather than on the facility or its staff.",
