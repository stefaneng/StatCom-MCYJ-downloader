    "A second attempt was made to interview Youth A at the facility on\n09/06/2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Specialist.

Staff 1\ndenied slamming, pushing, or doing anything to hurt Youth A. Staff\n1 said he tried to block Youth A from hitting him and did not intend\non grabbing his arm.

She said the\nincident escalated very fast, so she and Staff 3 immediately\n3",
    "intervened and had Staff 1 leave the cottage. She denied Staff 1\nbent or hurt Youth A’s hand. Youth A was very angry and left the\ncottage after the incident. She said Staff 4 followed Youth A\noutside until Youth A returned to the cottage.\nI interviewed Staff 3 via telephone on 09/26/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 3 recalled the incident and reported\nthat he went to deal with Youth B, because Youth B was getting\naggressive with Staff 1. Youth A came out of his room upset and\nangry, so Staff 1 tried to verbal deescalate Youth A. He didn’t see\nwhat happened with Youth A and Staff 1, because he was talking\nto Youth B in his room. He did not see how Youth A and Staff 1\nended up on the floor, but Staff 1 told him that Youth A was the\none that was being assaultive.

He didn’t see Staff 1 slam Youth A on the floor or bend his\nhand. He said Youth A left the cottage and he followed Youth A\noutside.
