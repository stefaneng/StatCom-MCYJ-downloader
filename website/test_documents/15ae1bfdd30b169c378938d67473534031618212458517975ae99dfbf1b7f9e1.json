It states Youth A was redirected and Staff person 1\nextended his arm in a protective stance and called for assistance.\nIt states Youth A was placed in a standing hold twice.

The video\nfootage at 2:40 pm on 08/29/2023 shows Youth A has a shirt\nwrapped over his head and runs into Staff person 1. It shows\nYouth A points at Staff person 1 and Staff person 1 extends his\narm horizontally out towards Youth A. It shows Youth A pushes\nStaff person 1 on his upper chest. It shows Staff person 1 stands\nbehind Youth A to place him in a hold, but Youth A and Staff\nperson 1 move to a corner by the door, which is blind spot for the\nvideo camera. Video footage from another angle shows when the\ndoor is opened that Youth A paces and hits Staff person 1. Video\nfootage shows Youth A and Staff person 1 return through the door\nand is in camera view. It shows Youth A runs down the hallway,\npushes a heavy, residential chair down the hallway, turns around\nand runs back down the hallway to the stairwell at 2:42 pm. Staff\nperson 2 and Youth C are standing in the hallway at the start of\nvideo. It shows Staff person 2 making a call. It shows Staff person\n2 and Youth C leave the hallway as the situation between Youth A\nand Staff person 1 unfolds.\nTour\nWalked through Wolverine Center third-floor hallway.\nAnother Department of Health and Human Service agency\ncompleted an investigation without finding.\nAnalysis It is not found that Staff person 1 choked Youth A on 08/29/2023\nfor the following reasons: 1) Youth A stated he was able to\nbreathe and talk when Staff person 1 choked him. 2) Staff person\n5",
    "1 denied choking Youth A and Staff person 2 denied seeing Staff\nperson 1 choke Youth A. 3) Supervisor 2 stated Youth A did not\nhave marks on his neck from being choked. 4) Available video\nreview does not capture Staff person 1 choking Youth A. 5) Youth\nA was transported to Wayne County Juvenile Detention on\n08/29/2023. Youth A’s initial nursing assessment completed on\n08/30/2023 at Wayne County Juvenile Detention does not indicate\nYouth A had marks or swelling on his neck.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy.\nIt is recommended that the current license status be continued.\n09/29/2023\n______________________________________\nVivian D Malleck Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 1, 2023\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n6"
