They also reported a belief that administration is supportive\nof staff and open to hearing about ideas the staff have about changes that bring\nmore positive interactions with youth.\nAll the youth currently in the two programs were interviewed and all reported a\npositive belief about the facility. Although, they would like to be at home, they report\nstaff are appropriate and provide safety for them. They all reported feeling safe at\nthe facility and reported staff are always supervising them. These youth also\nreported receiving numerous services to help them make better choices in their\ndecisions.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThis is a primarily single-story facility with a significant new addition. There are two\nareas that have a mezzanine level. The new addition added twice as much space\nand doubled the capacity of youth in the facility. Currently, they are not using the\nnew addition because the facility has not been able to hire the appropriate number\nof staff to provide appropriate supervision. The facility is very clean and excellently\nmaintained in all aspects. All plumbing was in working order. Each room is\nappropriately furnished, and cleaning supplies are locked as required. Medications\nare also locked, and the medication log is being appropriately completed. The\nkitchen was very clean, and the menu was posted for youth to observed. Employee\ndocumentation required to be posted was appropriately posted. Youth’s personal\nproperty was stored and documented on the youth’s inventory sheets. Emergency\ndrills and room check logs were reviewed and found to be appropriate.\n4",
