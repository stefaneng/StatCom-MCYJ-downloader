    "youth or others at serious threat of violence or injury if no\nimmediate intervention occurs.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 12/3/23, there was an unwarranted restraint on a youth by a\nstaff member.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth A was interviewed via facetime on 12/13/2023. Youth A\nreported he goes into other youth’s bedrooms to “beat their ass\nand take their stuff”. Youth A reported staff are present when he\ngoes into other youth’s bedrooms and staff “don’t do a god damn\nthing”. Youth A reported some staff will escort him out of other\nyouth’s bedrooms. Youth A goes into other youth’s bedrooms\nwhenever he “feels like it”. Youth A reported he is restrained at the\nfacility two to three times a day for fighting other youth and hitting\nstaff. Youth A reported he does not get restrained for going into\nother youth’s bedrooms. Youth A was very fidgety during the\ninterview and asked if he was done as well as asked about\nsmashing the cell phone, he was doing facetime on.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via Teams meeting on 12/14/2023.\nStaff 1 was working with Youth A on 12/3/2023. Youth A was\nagitated with other youth in the house and was running into other\nyouths’ bedrooms. Staff 1 asked Staff 2 to come assist with “eyes\non”. Youth A went into another youth’s bedroom throwing the\npeers stuff on the floor and ripped up a piece of paper. Staff 1\nreported she did a half restraint, half escort to get Youth A out of\nthe bedroom. Staff 1 described and demonstrated this as she had\nher right arm over Youth A’s right shoulder and looped under\nYouth A’s armpit as is taught in Aegis for a benevolent restraint\nand her left hand was placed on Youth A’s bicep area and Staff 1\nwalked Youth A out of the bedroom. Staff 1 could not recall if\nYouth A walked willingly out of the bedroom however, she thought\nhe did. Staff 1 reported “I knew I messed up” and explained this as\nshe instantly knew she should not have placed Youth A in a partial\nbenevolent restraint hold on the right side and should have placed\nhim in an escort to move him out of the bedroom. Staff 1 reported\nshe went into an old habit that was used at her prior place of\nemployment. Staff 1 reported the expectation at the facility would\nhave been for her to use proximity control in this situation and\nescort Youth A out of the bedroom and not place him in a\nrestraint. Staff 1 reported Youth A was in this hold for less than\none minute. Staff 1 did not recall if she completed an incident\nreport for this restraint. Staff 1 reported Youth A had\napproximately five incidents that day. Staff 1 reported she also\n2",
    "restrained Youth A after this incident as Youth A ran into the living\nroom and then ran back down the bedroom hallway and entered\nanother youth’s bedroom where there was broken glass. Youth A\nwas in the bedroom “messing it up”. Staff 1 reported Youth A\ncame towards the door at which time she placed him in a one\nhand escort and transitioned into a benevolent restraint. Youth A\ndropped his weight and Staff 1 transitioned Youth A to a seated\nsafety position. Staff 1 reported she did not remember why she\nplaced Youth A in the benevolent restraint. Once Staff 1 had\nYouth A in the seated safety position, she and Staff 2 talked with\nYouth A to calm him down. Youth A was verbalizing that no one\nlikes him at the facility. Youth A reported he was going into his\npeers’ bedrooms because he was mad at his peers. Staff 1 held\nYouth A in the restraint for approximately ten minutes. During this\ntime, Youth A attempted to hit Staff 1 in the face and hit Staff 1’s\nglasses and attempted to pinch Staff 1’s upper thigh and leg.\nStaff 1 secured Youth A’s hands while in the seated safety\nposition to prevent Youth A from hitting and pinching her by\napplying a slight grasp on his hand with light pressure. Staff 1\nreported Youth A said “ouch” during the hold, so she loosened up\non the restraint however Youth A then tried to move to get out of\nthe restraint, so she resecured the restraint. Youth A did not say\nanything after Staff 1 resecured the restraint. Staff 1 reported the\nfacility policy is restraints can be completed when a youth is\nharmful to their self or others and when a youth is being unsafe\nwith their actions. Staff 1 reported the first restraint was not\nnecessary and she should have escort Youth A out of the\nbedroom. Staff 1 reported the second restraint there was glass in\nthe bedroom from a broken window. Youth A was near the glass\nhowever did not try to pick it up. Staff 1 recalled Youth A said\nsomething about the glass however did not recall what he said.\nStaff 1 reported she believed Youth A tried to hit her but did not\nremember. Staff 1 reported Supervisor informed staff to do the\nwhole 10-minute restraints with Youth A to make sure Youth A is\ncalm and regulated prior to disengaging from the restraint.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n12/12/2023. Staff 2 was working on 12/3/2023 when Youth A was\nrestraint by Staff 1. Youth A had been restrained a few times on\n12/3/2023. Youth A was restrained earlier in the morning for\ngoing into another youth’s bedroom and breaking the window in\nthe bedroom and attempting to get glass. The other youth was\nvery upset and became escalated with Youth A for doing this.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A goes into his peer’s bedrooms and break\ntheir belongings which escalates peers to want to fight Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A was placed in three restraints during his\n3",
    "shift on 12/3/2023, 1 restraint with Staff 1 and two restraints with\nStaff 2. Youth A ran down the bedroom hallway and went into the\npeer’s bedroom where he broke the window earlier that morning.\nStaff 2 was right behind Youth A and escorted Youth A out of the\nbedroom by placing his hands on Youth A’s shoulders and guiding\nhim out of the bedroom. Staff 1 was outside the bedroom door\nand when Staff 2 removed his hands from Youth A’s shoulder,\nStaff 1 placed Youth A in a standing restraint. Staff 2 reported he\nobserved the restraint with Youth A and Staff 1 as he was\nmonitoring the time. Staff 2 reported no concerns with the\nrestraint other than Youth A was swinging his arms and Staff 1\nsecured Youth A’s fingertips to prevent Youth A from swinging his\narms and pinching her. Staff 2 did not recall if the restraint was a\nstanding or seated restraint, Staff 2 believed Staff 1 did transition\nto a seated restraint. Staff 2 did not recall Youth A saying anything\nduring the restraint. Staff 2 felt the restraint was warranted as\nYouth A went back into the bedroom where he had broken the\nwindow that morning and he was unsure if there was still broken\nglass in the bedroom as well as he was concerned the peer’s\nwhose bedroom it was would become escalated again if Youth A\ndid anything in his bedroom and try to assault Youth A.\nAdministrator was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n12/12/2023. Administrator reviewed the video footage and viewed\nthere were two separate unwarranted restraints with Youth A\nback-to-back for Youth A going into other youth’s bedrooms.\nAdministrator reported a safety plan has been discussed with staff\nto ensure the wing door is shut during waking hours to minimize\nyouth going into other youth’s bedrooms as Youth A has a pattern\nof going into other youth’s bedrooms and destroying items.\nAdministrator reported Youth A has been at the facility\napproximately three weeks and there have been several restraints\nwith him. Youth A has verbalized he wants to be restrained and is\nacting out to get restrained as he believes this will get him out of\nthe facility. Administrator reported the facility is working on\noccupational therapy for Youth A as well as he just started\nmedications. The facility is looking into compression shirts, a\nweighted vest, weighted socks and weighted sheets for Youth A\nas there are sensory concerns. Administrator reported in case\nreview team Youth A was discussed and recommendations from\nthe case review team are for restraints to not be released based\non the appearance of calm speech and movement, rather after\nYouth A has processed the incident with staff and comes up with a\nreasonable plan to maintain stable behaviors after the incident.\n4",
    "Complainant was interviewed via telephone on 12/11/2023\nand reported they had no further information.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage of 12/3/2023 in Leppien bedroom hallway was\nreviewed on 12/12/2023. Upon looking at video footage on\n12/3/2023 at 11:42am, there was no restraints viewed. It appears\nthe camera time is off by 1 hour as video footage at 12:40pm\nshows Youth A going into a peer’s bedroom and Staff 1 and Staff\n2 going to the bedroom door, Staff 1 goes into the bedroom and\nwalks out of the bedroom with Youth A’s right arm in a benevolent\nrestraint position and Staff 1 has her left-hand holding Youth A’s\nleft bicep area. Staff 1 is standing behind Youth A and walks\nYouth A out of the bedroom. Staff 1 holds Youth A outside the\nbedroom for approximately nine seconds and releases Youth A.\nIn less than a minute later Youth A goes back down the hall and\nStaff 2 is seen escorting Youth A out of another bedroom. Staff 2\nreleases Youth A from the escort hold. Youth A goes to go into\nanother youth’s bedroom and Staff 1 places Youth A in a\nbenevolent restraint. Youth A is moving his legs and Staff 1\ntransitions into the seated safety position. Staff 2 moves to the\nground and is positioned in front of Youth A however due to the\ncamera angle it is unclear what Staff 2 is doing.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Michigan Department of Health & Human Services Incident\nReport 169300217 dated 12/3/2023 at 11:42am: Youth A\nran from the kitchen to the bedroom hallway and was going\ninto other youth’s bedrooms and messing them up. Youth\nA was asked by Staff 2 to stop and did not respond. When\nYouth A went into one of the bedroom doorways Staff 1\ntook ahold of Youth A’s arm and brought him out of the\nbedroom and placed him in a benevolent restraint since\nYouth A is known for going into other peer’s bedrooms all\nthe time at 11:42am. Staff 1 transitioned into an Aegis\nsafety position at 11:43am and maintained this position\nuntil 11:46am when Youth A was attempting to pinch Staff\n1’s shoulder and Staff 1 secured Youth A’s right hand and\ntransitioned to a standing benevolent restraint until\n11:52am. The incident report documents during debriefing\nstaff were advised by Supervisor not to release restraints\nwith Youth A until Youth A is fully physically and verbally\nregulated.\n• Eagle Village Residential Services Standard Operating\nProcedures Therapeutic Holds: When a youth presents an\n5",
    "unanticipated or severely aggressive behavior that places\nthe youth or others at serious threat of violence or injury if no\nimmediate intervention occurs, and all other less restrictive\ntechniques have been exhausted, an Aegis: Voluntary\nEscort/Level One Hold/Level Two/Level Three/Aegis Safety\nPosition/1 to 1 Benevolent Restraint may be deemed\nnecessary. It is imperative that staff utilize the two staff\ninterventions as a primary method of intervening physically,\nthe 1 to 1 Benevolent Restraint is only for those times when\nit is not possible to achieve the two staff intervention.\n• Staff 1 and Staff 2’s personnel file: Staff 1 and Staff 2 had\nno disciplinary record. Staff 1 and Staff 2 completed Aegis\ntraining on 11/8/2023.\n• Eagle Village CAURT Form for Youth A dated 12/5/2023:\nYouth A has been having multiple restraints and is having\ndifficulty with following directions and is attempting to\ndestroy property with hopes of being kicked out of the\nfacility. Youth A is relaying on staff to complete restraints\nwhen he is escalated. Youth A has reported to staff he\nwants to be placed in restraints in hopes of being kicked\nout of the facility. Discussion of Youth A being in several\nshort restraints on an almost daily basis. Discussed the\nlonger holds have been noted to have had a longer, and\nmore therapeutic effect on Youth A. Identified that past\nrestraints had ended because he was talking and moving\ncalmly but after the restraints would be released, he would\nalmost immediately show escalation and require another\nrestraint. Restraints moving forward are recommended to\nnot be released based on the appearance of calm speech\nand movement, but after he has processed the incident\nwith staff and has given a reasonable plan to maintain\nstable behaviors after the incident.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance as both restraints with\nYouth A were unwarranted as Youth A was going into peer’s\nbedrooms and the restraints were not in response to protect the\nyouth or others from an unanticipated or severely aggressive\nbehavior that places the youth or others at serious threat of\nviolence or injury if no immediate intervention occurs.\nTechnical Assistance\nDuring Staff 1’s interview, she implied that the plan for the youth is\nto not release from restraint until the 10-minute mark. Ensure staff\nare clear that youth is to be released after he has processed the\n6",

Staff 2 did not know why there was not an incident\nreport written for the restraint with Youth A that occurred a minute\nprior to him being restrained for a second time.\nAdministrator was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n12/12/2023. Administrator reported the incident report 169300217\nwas entered and approved late and she will be reviewing the\nlicensing rule with staff. Administrator was under the\nunderstanding incident reports needed to be entered “timely” and\nindicated confusion with licensing rule changes. Administrator\nreported the facility has been sending emails to workers, parents,\netc. regarding the restraints per the licensing rule and provided the\nemail that was sent regarding Youth A’s restraint to his primary\nworker. Administrator did not know why the other restraint on\n12/3/2023 found while reviewing video footage did not have an\nincident report documenting the restraint. Administrator\nacknowledged there should have been two incident reports written\nfor the two separate restraints.\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on 12/11/2023\nand reported they had no further information.\n7",
