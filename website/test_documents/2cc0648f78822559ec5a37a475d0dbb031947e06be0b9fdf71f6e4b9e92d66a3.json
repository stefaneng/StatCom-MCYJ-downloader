Compliance\n08/05/2022 Pre-exit meeting with Program Manager in Chief Administrator’s\nabsence\nALLEGATION:\nYouth is deaf and communicates via sign language and has been in placement since\n3/25/22. Since that time, no caseworker has attempted to communicate with youth\nnor has an interpreter been utilized.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on July 13, 2022. Complainant\nstated Youth A was placed in her home since the end of March 2022. Complainant\nstated Youth A’s siblings were placed in the home in the past so they were aware of\nYouth A’s communication needs because he would occasionally visit. She stated the\nagency reported Youth A only knew 20 American Sign Language (ASL) signs and\nhad not had any behavioral issues since January 2022. Complainant stated Youth A\nknows a lot more than 20 signs. She stated Youth A has been receiving sign\nlanguage services since he was initially removed 2 years ago and attends a deaf\nand hard of hearing program at school. She stated the school has encouraged her\nand her husband to use sign language with Youth A as much as possible to assist\nhim in learning. Complainant stated Youth A uses ASL to communicate and the\nagency does not involve interpreters as part of his case management. She stated\n2",
    "she requested an interpreter to communicate major changes such as termination of\nhis mother’s parental rights in May 2022 and when he was going to be moved from\ntheir home in early July 2022. Complainant stated the agency told her Youth A’s\ntherapist, who is fluent with ASL, can communicate those changes to Youth A. She\nstated she has had to fight to have the agency utilize an interpreter. She stated\nwhen the agency foster care worker completed home visits there was never an\ninterpreter present other than two occasions when the therapist assisted.\nComplainant stated the foster care worker would wear a mask initially, which she\nunderstood, but without an interpreter and no way for Youth A to read lips there was\nno communication between Youth A and the assigned foster care worker. She\nstated there was only very minimal communication between the assigned foster care\nworker and Youth A because of the communication barrier. She stated they were\ntold to contact the enhanced foster care team or mobile crisis team through Network\n180 when Youth A escalates but that has been ineffective because EFC mobile\ncrisis tries to verbally deescalate Youth A and he is unable to communicate verbally.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face-to-face at the agency on July\n18, 2022. CA stated she has processed vouchers for interpreter services so knows\nthe service has been used but was unsure how often. CA stated she will pull the\nvouchers that have been processed so far to determine if interpreter services were\nused during home visits and not documented in the case file. The agency utilizes\nDeaf and Hard of Hearing Services for an interpreter.\nFoster Care supervisor (FC Supervisor) was interviewed face-to-face at the\nagency on July 18, 2022. FC Supervisor stated she was the assigned foster case\nmanager prior to being promoted to supervisor. She stated Youth A was initially\nplaced with his older sibling and an ASL interpreter was used primarily with the\nsibling who demonstrated a better understanding of ASL. Youth A was not able to\nengage in ASL and showed some cognitive delays. In addition, the initial foster\nplacement had over 15 years of ASL experience. Youth A was eventually moved to\na new foster placement due to his behavioral issues. The second foster placement\nalso had experience with ASL. FC supervisor stated Youth A would mimic\ninterpreters and not answer so the agency did not utilize interpreters as they felt it\nwas not beneficial. FC Supervisor stated Youth A has progressed some with his use\nand understanding of ASL more recently. She stated Foster Care Worker utilized an\ninterpreter in May, June and July but there may have been a month or two where an\ninterpreter was not utilized.\nFC Supervisor stated in order to secure an interpreter the agency contacts Deaf and\nHard of Hearing Services. If the request is not made at least 3 days in advance,\nthere is an emergency fee and there is no guarantee there will be an interpreter\navailable. She stated that Foster Care Worker tries to utilize the same interpreter\nwhen visiting Youth A so it is someone familiar to him.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed face-to-face at the agency on July\n18, 2022. FCW stated he has been the assigned caseworker since March 2022.\n3",
    "Youth A’s foster placement when he was initially assigned were fluent in ASL, so he\nused them to assist him during home visits. FCW stated Youth A’s language skills\nare closer to a 4-year-old. FCW stated Youth A would often mimic when interpreters\nattempted to communicate with him. FCW stated Youth A has recently made\nimprovements with ASL and the agency has been utilizing interpreters since May.\nFCW stated he utilized an interpreter in May to inform Youth A that his biological\nmother’s parental rights had been terminated. He stated Youth A seemed to\nunderstand more than he had in the past and his level of communication had\nnoticeably improved. As a result, he stated his supervisor advised him in early June\nthat he is to utilize an interpreter during home visits from that point forward.\nFCW stated during home visits when an interpreter was not utilized, he would do the\nbest he could as far covering aspects of a quality visit. He stated the foster parents\nwere learning ASL and would assist if they were able.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n 3/11/2020 IEP indicates Youth A was enrolled in preschool program which\nuses ASL for communication and he was learning ASL. Also states his mode\nof communication is ASL and gesturing.\n 3/17/2021 IEP indicates Youth A is placed in a classroom that utilizes ASL\nexclusively.\n MISACWIS placement record: Youth A was placed with previous foster\nparents from 3/28/2022 through 7/8/2022. Youth A was at Devos from\n6/28/2022-7/1/2022.\n Education section of 1/13/2022 USP states Youth A is working on language at\nschool.\n Invoices submitted to agency from Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services for\nYouth A dated February 21, 2022, May 26, 2022, June 7, 2022, and June 14,\n2022.\n MISACWIS case file: Social work contact (SWC) in which face-to-face contact\nwith Youth A occurred in the foster placement between 3/28/2022-7/8/2022\nwere reviewed. A total of 25 SWC were entered (including enhanced foster\ncare), 3 of those contacts noted interpreters from Deaf and Hard of Hearing\nServices were present. SWC dated 5/26/2022 interpreters were present to\ncommunicate to Youth A of the recent court action to terminate his mother’s\nparental rights. SWC dated 6/7/2022 noted an interpreter was present. SWC\ndated 7/8/2022 interpreters were present to communicate to Youth A that he\nwas being moved to a new foster placement.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(1) An agency shall develop service plans with the child, the\nchild's parents or legal guardian, the referring agency, and\nthe other parties involved in providing needed services, or\nmedical care, unless the agency documents why any of the\nentities have not been involved.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: Based on interviews conducted and review of Youth A’s\nMISACWIS case file, the agency did not always utilize American\nSign Language interpreters when conducting face-to-face\nmeetings with Youth A in the foster placement. Individualized\nEducation Plans were reviewed for the past 2 years, and those\ndocuments indicate Youth A’s sole method of communication\nwhile at school is ASL.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nIn order for a quality visit to occur between the foster care\ncaseworker and the youth, they need to be able to communicate\nwith the use of interpreter services not relying on the placement\nprovider to allow the youth to provide feedback in a safe setting.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan no change be\nmade to the license of this child placing agency.\n____________8/5/2022___________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 5, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
