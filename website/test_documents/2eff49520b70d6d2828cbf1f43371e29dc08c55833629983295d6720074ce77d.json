    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 grabbed and twisted Youth C's arm and pushed her head\nagainst the wall. There are no marks or bruises.\nInvestigation I notified Complainant, who is also Youth C’s foster care worker,\nthat I was assigned this joint investigation with Government\nWorker 1. Complainant expressed no additional concerns\nregarding the facility.\nI collaborated with Government Worker 1 via email.\nMultiple barriers were encountered related to viewing video of\nincident in question. Government Worker 1 and I arrived\nunannounced at the facility on 6/16/23 and spoke with Chief\nAdministrator (CA). CA was already aware of the allegation made\nby Complainant on 6/14/23. We requested video footage of the\ninteraction between Staff 1 and Youth C on 6/14/23. CA told us\nshe had not viewed the video and does not know how to access\nthem. She said another individual who works off-site for\nGenacross has access to the videos. CA contacted that individual\nin our presence and requested the video be accessed and sent to\nGovernment Worker 1 as soon as possible.\nVideo footage arrived at Government Worker 1’s inbox in 20\nseparate unmarked pieces. They had to be arranged in\nchronological order and viewed separately. Government Worker 1\nrequested a clearer copy of one of the videos and did not receive\nit for two days. I was unable to view the 20 videos on my\ncomputer so Government Worker 1 texted them to my phone. I\nwas unable to view them in chronological sequence as the\ntimestamps were too small to read.\nGovernment Worker 1 and I were able to view two or three of the\n20 videos together at the facility. One video showed Staff 1\nphysically struggling with Youth C against a wall and blocking her\n2",
    "from moving. Government Worker 1 and I located CA on the\nresidential unit, asked her to view the video with us and develop a\nseparation plan for Staff 1 and Youth C. CA said she was unable\nto view it because she was working as direct care staff monitoring\ntwo children for the next two hours. Later that afternoon,\nGovernment Worker 1 and I telephoned CA and asked her again\nto view the video and develop a separation plan. After viewing it,\nCA decided Staff 1 should be placed on administrative leave\npending the outcome of the investigation. I confirmed with\nLicensee Designee (LD) that Staff 1 was indeed placed on leave\non 6/16/23.\nVIDEO\nI viewed videos of the hallway where the incident began around\n8:02am. They show Staff 1 and Youth C talking in the hall. Staff 1\nis positioned directly in front of Youth C with her back to the\ncamera. At some point Youth C appears to hit or attempt to hit\nStaff 1 but the camera does not show this. Staff 1 responds by\npushing Youth C to the wall with her arms, momentarily pinning\nher. The two physically disengage and move together down the\nhall. Youth C sits or falls to the floor then stands. Youth C tries to\nmove past Staff 1, but Staff 1 blocks/pushes into her with her\nbody. Youth C and Staff 1 are in Youth C’s bedroom alone\ntogether twice - once for 18 seconds and another time for 52\nseconds. Other videos show Youth C laying on the floor at the\nend of the hallway with Staff 1 standing nearby.\nI interviewed Youth C jointly with Government Worker 1. When\nasked about her morning routine, she said she usually wakes up\nat 8:30am, gets dressed and stays in her room until breakfast is\nserved. She said breakfast is not served at any certain time.\nWhen asked about Staff 1, Youth C described her as “mean.” “If\nwe come out (of our rooms) without permission, we get privileges\ntaken away,” she added. Initially Youth C refused to elaborate.\nGiven time and support, she said Staff 1 grabbed her arm, pushed\nher and hit the middle of her head “really hard” on the wall in her\nbedroom. “I told her, ‘You almost broke my head open.’” Youth C\ndoes not have any injuries as a result. However, she said she\ndoes not feel safe with Staff 1 or Former Staff 3. *Note - Former\nStaff 3 resigned on 6/14/23 while being investigated for alleged\nabuse/neglect (see SIR 2023C0000500).\nI interviewed Youth Y jointly with Government Worker 1. He has\nbeen at the facility for 11 months. Youth Y said he comes out of\nhis room at 9am or whenever breakfast is ready. He did not know\n3",
    "what would happen if he tried to come out of his room before\nbreakfast. Youth Y was unaware of the incident involving Staff 1\nand Youth C.\nI interviewed Youth B jointly with Government Worker 1. He was\nunaware of the incident involving Staff 1 and Youth C.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 on 6/16/23\nand 7/7/23. She has worked midnight shift at the facility for one\nyear and was last trained in CPI physical management in Feb\n2023. Staff 1 has no disciplinary write-ups in her file.\nGovernment Worker 1 asked Staff 1 about her interaction with\nYouth C on the morning of 6/14/23. She said she and Staff 2\nwere working. It was between 7:30 – 8:00am when Youth C\nasked for the time. Staff 1 redirected her back to her room\nbecause “other kids were still asleep, and it was too early to get\nup.”\nIn the hallway, Staff 1 said “Youth C jumped toward me, went to\nhit me and hit me. I stopped her.” Staff 1 put both hands out in\nfront of herself demonstrating how she stopped Youth C. “Youth\nB and Y mocked Youth C and Youth C went to get at them. I\nblocked her body with my body…I pushed her in the room…I did\nnot do anything vicious when I pushed her. I got her in her room\nand yes, she fell on the bed. She accused me of hurting her and\nthrowing her against the wall…said she’d tell her worker. Youth C\nslid down the wall and tried to open another kid’s door with her\nfoot. She told me I ought to quit…like Former Staff 3.” Staff 1\ndenied ever grabbing Youth C’s arm or hitting her head against\nthe wall. After the incident Staff 1 said she examined Youth C’s\nhead and saw no injury.\nI asked Staff 1 what justified the single-person physical\ninterventions she utilized with Youth C. She said “If a youth\nattacks me, I can block and deflect…We could not use CPI (two-\nperson control hold) because there were only two of us and Staff 2\nhad to stay with Youth Y because he will run. We didn’t have the\nluxury of a third staff.” I asked Staff 1 why she physically tried to\nmove Youth C into her room. She responded, “Because Youth C\nwas trying to fight Youths Y and B.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 by phone\non 6/23/23. She has worked at the facility for one year. Staff 2\nexplained what she saw on the morning of 6/14/23. “There are\nonly two staff (monitoring six youth) before 9am so we try to\n4",
    "convince kids to stay in their rooms. Youth C wasn’t wanting to\nlisten…Youth C was lying on the floor and refused to go to her\nroom. I saw Staff 1 put her hands on Youth C’s upper arm or\nback. It was like she was trying to herd her back into her room. I\nsaw Youth C swing at Staff 1. I don’t know if she made contact.\nStaff 1 told her, ‘You don’t hit staff’.”\nStaff 2 said Staff 1 and Youth C went into Youth C’s room for less\nthan five minutes. “I don’t know exactly what happened. I heard\nYouth C say, ‘You pushed me. You almost made me hit my head.\nStaff 1 said out loud, ‘You hit your bed not the wall.’ I didn’t know\nwhat to do. I was keeping Youths B and Y occupied (in their\nrooms). Staff 1 said it is atypical for a staff person to be alone\nwith a youth in her room for that length of time.\nAnalysis Video shows Staff 1 push Youth C and momentarily pin her\nagainst the wall in the hallway. Staff 1 referred to this push as a\nblock or deflection. Blocks are done while the staff person is\nstationary. Staff 1 however, moved toward the youth and pushed\nher against the wall, which is not considered a block. Staff 1 also\nadmitted she pushed Youth C into her room. Pushing a youth on\nany part of their body is prohibited.\nVideo shows Staff 1 body-block Youth C as the youth tries to\nmove past her. Staff 1 said she blocked her to prevent her from\nattacking Youths B and Y who were mocking her. However, a\nfight between youths was not imminent. Body-blocking the\nyouth’s movement was unjustified.\nIn her room, Youth C claimed Staff 1 grabbed her arm, pushed her\nand hit her head “really hard” on the wall. Staff 1 denied grabbing\nYouth C’s arm, pushing her or hitting her head on the wall in the\nbedroom. She admitted to pushing Youth C into her room and\nYouth C falling onto the bed. There are no cameras inside of the\nbedrooms.\nThe entire situation was unnecessary and could have been\navoided. It started only because Staff 1 decided it was too early\nfor Youth C to be out of her room and Youth C would not follow\nher directive to return to her room.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThis incident occurred the morning of 6/14/23. CA was aware of it\nthat same day but did not view the video until investigators asked\nher to do so on 6/16/23. CA told us other individuals at\nGenacross monitor the videos, but it was unclear when they view\n5",
    "it and what they monitor for. I emphasized the importance of CA\nproactively viewing video of known incidents particularly those that\nrelate to allegations of abuse/neglect on the part of staff. It\nseemed lost on her that she is responsible for looking into\nsituations and developing timely safety/separation plans to protect\nchildren when potential abuse has occurred. In another\ninvestigation that commenced on 5/31/23 wherein three staff were\nsuspected of abuse, CA also did not assess those situations or\nstaff timely to decide if they were safe to continue working pending\nthe outcome. The facility was recently cited in SIR\n2023C0000532 for CA failing to assess staff situations in a timely\nmanner potentially placing children at risk.\nCONSULTATION\nStaff 1 was inside a room alone with Youth C twice for 18 and 52\nseconds. When youths are escalated or aggressive, it is\ninadvisable for staff to be alone with them particularly in enclosed\nareas out of view of the cameras.\nAdrian Group Home is a small to mid-sized group home with a\ncapacity of ten. It is owned and run by parent-agency Genacross.\nGenacross employs a number of administrative staff who work off-\nsite and perform roles in positions unregulated by Division of Child\nWelfare Licensing (DCWL). Genesis refers to these non-\nregulated staff as Supervisor of Group Homes, Trainer, HR\nOfficer, Hiring Manager, Manager of Compliance, Director of\nOperations and Rights Officer. Throughout the course of this\ninvestigation, state investigators received emails directly from\nindividuals in non-regulated positions such as HR Officer,\nManager of Compliance and Director of Operations.\nThe Chief Administrator and Licensee Designee are positions\nregulated by the licensing agency. With multiple state\ninvestigators entering the facility, it is helpful if the point of contact\nis limited to these one or two individuals for accountability\npurposes and to cut down on confusion. The main contact person\nworks on-site and is usually the Chief Administrator or designee.\nOne or both must be available and have the ability to provide\ntimely information to investigators upon request. State\ninvestigators cannot be expected to know or understand the\norganizational hierarchy of the parent agency or work with multiple\nindividuals in non-regulated positions at Genacross. Conversely,\nas the person ultimately responsible for the facility, it is expected\nthe Chief Administrator be thoroughly knowledgeable of the\nlicensing rules, Adrian Group Home policies, MDHHS\npolicies/contract requirements and be heavily involved in internal\n6",
    "matters such as intake/admissions, assessing and assuring\nquality, writing corrective action plans, accessing, viewing, and\nanalyzing video, hiring/training/disciplining staff and much more.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2023C0000500 intake 5/31/23; CAP pending\nRule Code & Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (4) Only the least restrictive intervention necessary to prevent\nimmediate harm to the youth or others may be used and must\nfollow an individualized set of graduated interventions that avoid\nthe use of restraints.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 engaged in a verbal power struggle with Youth C that\nbecame physical.\nInvestigation Youth C woke up, came out of her room, and wanted to stay out of\nher room around 8am. Staff 1 wanted her to go back in her room\nand stay there until 9am which is when dayshift staff arrive. Staff\n1 engaged in a verbal power struggle trying to get Youth C to\nreturn to her room when being out of her room caused no harm to\nherself or others. During this unnecessary verbal back and forth,\nStaff 1 said Youth C hit her. While it is possible Youth C hit her,\nthere were no witnesses, it could not be seen on the video and\nStaff 1 did not write an incident report indicating she was hit by the\nyouth. The verbal power struggle between Youth C escalated to a\nphysical one where Staff 1 pushed Youth C and briefly pinned her\nagainst the wall. The entire situation could have been avoided\nhad Staff 1 merely allowed Youth C to be out of her room when\nshe was ready to start her day.\nAnalysis Staff 1 engaged in a verbal power struggle when the youth was\ncausing no harm to herself or others. The situation escalated to a\nphysical one. Least restrictive interventions were not utilized.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000228 intake 2/8/23, CAP approved 4/13/23\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n7",
    "(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation There was no incident report describing the interaction that\noccurred between Staff 1 and Youth C on 6/14/23.\nInvestigation The agency’s incident report policy indicates a non-critical incident\nreport should be written for physical acting out; not leading to\nrestraint.\nThere was no incident report describing the interaction that\noccurred between Staff 1 and Youth C on 6/14/23 between 8 –\n8:30am. Staff 1 said Youth C hit her and the video showed a\nphysical struggle between the staff and the youth in the hall. Staff\n1 and Youth C were alone together in a room and Staff 2 heard\nYouth C say Staff 1 pushed her.\nAnalysis Per agency policy, Staff 1 should have written an incident report\ndescribing the interaction between her and Youth C on the\nmorning of 6/14/23.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000500 intake 5/31/23; CAP pending.\n2023C0000538 intake 6/13/23; CAP pending.\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112 Staff qualifications.\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 does not have the ability to perform her assigned duties.\nInvestigation Due to Staff 1’s behavior, Government Worker 1 confirmed a case\nagainst her deeming her unsuitable to work with children.\nAnalysis Government Worker 1 deemed Staff 1 unsuitable to work with\nchildren.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000500 intake 5/31/23; CAP pending\n8",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJuly 13, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 18, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n9"
