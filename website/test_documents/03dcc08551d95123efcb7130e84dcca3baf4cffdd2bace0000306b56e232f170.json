I observed the\nfreezer that had been repaired that was in the kitchen area as well\nas other refrigerated appliances in the kitchen area. The freezer\nwas operating properly. Any food/waste in the area was disposed\nof properly.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Staff 1 and Program Manager at the facility on\n04/02/2025. They both stated the freezer had been repaired and\nthere was no food lost as the food had been transferred to other\nrefrigerated units when the freezer broke down. Staff 1 and\nProgram Manager stated there are times when flies and gnats will\ngather around food that is left out or uncovered and spoiled food\nthat is not disposed of properly. Staff 1 and Program Manager\nstated the rural location of the facility probably contributes to that\nsituation.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 04/02/2025.

This documentation was received 04/08/2025.\nI contacted Complainant by email 06/02/2025.
