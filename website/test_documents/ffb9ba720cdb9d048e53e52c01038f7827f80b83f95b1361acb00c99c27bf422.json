EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was 1 substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. Special evaluation 2024SEC0001560 was initiated on 4/22/2024 regarding\nallegations a licensed foster parent got into a \"tussle\" with a foster youth, grabbed the\nyouth by the arm after a household item was knocked over and made disparaging\nremarks about the youth's mental health. The licensed foster parent was found to be\nin violation of licensing rules. The evaluation was thorough and well written. A CAP\nwas developed, which foster parents refused to sign. As a result, revocation of the\nfoster home license was initiated.",
    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe agency Interim inspection was completed on 10/3/2023 and the CAP was\napproved on 10/31/2023. The agency was cited for 11 violations, 6 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 6, there was an improvement in individual incidents of\nnon-compliance within 2 of the violation areas (DHS 1105 and PATP) and a slight\nincrease in number of individual incidents in 1 area (FTM) and no change in the\nremaining 3 areas (special evaluation report within 15 days medical appointment\nand medical passport). In 2022, 15 violations were established, 6 of which were\nrepeated this year. All of the repeated violations remain close to the same number\nof individual incidents of non-compliances. The agency will need to establish\nadditional corrective planning for the repeated violations to ensure a reduction of\nincidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The Chief Administrator\nindicated the agency has a quarterly internal audit process that appears to have\nincreased compliance and consistency from the previous year. The assessment\nnoted the agency has struggled somewhat due to a high number of staff with\nlimited experience. The CA reported the agency dealt with a large number of\nplacement crises over the past year and staff demonstrated effective team work to\nwork together to address the crisis effectively. The CA reported she feels confident\nthe agency will continue to show improvement based on the processes in place.\nFinancial Overview\nThere were no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's audit.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via telephone. Staff reported\nsupervisors hold regularly scheduled supervision meetings and are available as\nneeded if issues/questions arise. In addition, coworkers assist as needed. Staff\nreported communication is good overall, but some policy changes could be\ncommunicated timelier. Staff reported no concerns or areas of need.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n________9/4/2024______________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n9/6/2024\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
