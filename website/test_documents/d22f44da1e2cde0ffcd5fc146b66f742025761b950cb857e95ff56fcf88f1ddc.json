A corrective action plan(CAP)\nwas implemented to continue to allow the foster parent to remain\nat the residence without approving the home for licensure as the\nhomeowner will not allow the home to be licensed. The agency did\nnot complete timely background checks on persons residing at the\nnew residence. It is not appropriate for a CAP to be implemented\nat a home that is unable to be license.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed on 6/18/2024. There was no\nadditional information to add.\nA TEAM conference was held on 8/15/2024 with the\nadministrative staff of Macomb DHHS familiar with the\nallegation of the foster home and foster parent. The Foster Care\nWorker was on annual leave during this time. The Foster\nCare/Licensing Supervisor led the conversation regarding the\nallegation.\nFoster Care/ Licensing Supervisor reported the Foster Parent\nmoved into her brother’s home on 11/25/2023 without the\nknowledge of the Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices (MDHHS). She reported Foster Parent failed to have a\ndiscussion with her licensing and foster care workers in advance\nof the move and only notified the workers via text messages after\nFoster Parent had already moved. She reported Foster Parent\nhad placement of Foster Child A at the time of her relocation.\nFoster Care/ Licensing Supervisor said she learned later, on\n12/21/2023 from the Licensing Specialist Supervisor that Foster\nParent moved the week of Thanksgiving due to her inability to pay\nher rent because the company she was working for went on strike.\nFoster Care/ Licensing Supervisor said she also learned that\nFoster Parent had shared with Licensing Specialist that she was\n2",
    "considering a move in October 2024, but did not have any details\nabout the move or any specific plans or timeframes.\nFoster Care/ Licensing Supervisor said as soon as she heard\nFoster Parent had moved, (12/21/2023) she immediately had the\nLicensing Specialist initiate a special investigation.\nFoster Care/Licensing Supervisor said the agency offered the\noption of licensing the home Foster Parent was currently residing\nin, however Foster Parent’s Brother who owns the home was not\nin agreement with the licensing process in the beginning. She\nsaid Foster Parent’s Brother later decided to get his home\nlicensed and attended orientation. She said Foster Parent’s\nBrother later reported a lack of interest due to the removal of\nFoster Child A from the home in December, 2023. She said on\n1/26/2024, Licensing Specialist discovered Foster Parent’s\nBrother’s home was unsuitable to be licensed. This came as a\nresult of a safety alert by DCWL Analyst.\nFoster Care/ Licensing Supervisor reported the decision to place\nFoster Parent on hold and implement a corrective action plan\ncame after careful consideration of the circumstances, the\nexcellent care of the children placed in Foster Parent’s home prior\nand her ability to work with the foster care staff and parents. She\nreported Foster Parent wanted to remain licensed and was willing\nto obtain her own housing within 6 months. She said despite the\nFoster Parent’s reason for relocating, the Foster Parent’s income\nwas adequate to live independently, and Foster Parent had no\nprior special evaluations. Foster Care/Licensing Supervisor said\nthe agency sought to prevent a foster home closure because the\nagency has a great need for foster parents.\nFoster Care Worker 1 (FCW) was interviewed on 8/23/2024.\nShe reported Foster Parent was a newly licensed home that\nopened on 4/3/2023. Foster Parent was licensed for one child\naged 0-2 years old. She said Foster Child A was placed in her\nhome from 10/27/2023 until his replacement on 12/22/2023. FCW\n1 said Foster Parent informed her of her move from her apartment\non 11/25/2023 via text message. She reported she had a\nconversation with Foster Parent informing her she could not move\nwithout informing the department beforehand. FCW 1 said she\nhad no concerns about Foster Parent’s ability of being an\nadequate foster parent to Foster Child A that was placed in her\ncare.\n3",
    "FCW 1 reported she went to Foster Parent’s home monthly and\nobserved no safety concerns. She reported a clearance was not\nsought on Foster Parent’s Brother or a safety plan put in place\nbecause this was not her area of expertise, she was unaware of\nlicensing policies and that Licensing Specialist was informed at\nthe same time she was informed. She provided no additional\ninformation.\nLicensing Specialist (LS) reported a special evaluation was\ninitiated with Foster Parent on 12/21/2023.

He did state\nthat Macomb DHHS administrative team made the decision of\nplacing the Foster Parent on a CAP.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Foster Child A’s case record in MiSACWIS – placement\nchange dated 10/27/2023 due to maternal grandmother\nsuddenly passing on 9/29/2023.

Target date 2/29/2024.\n4",
    "Analysis The agency is found in violation with the rule as the appropriate\nlicensing action of providing a CAP to the Foster Parent was not\nconsistent with facts contained in the foster home. The foster\nhome the Foster Parent was living in was unable to be licensed\ndue to structural and home repair issues. Foster Parent brother\ndid have a background check as he was the Foster Parent\nsubstitute caregiver.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Special evaluation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327\nSection • (1) Upon receipt of any information that relates to possible\nDescription noncompliance with any foster home rule, the agency must\ndo all the following:\n• (a) Submit a special investigation record to the\ndepartment’s licensing authority within 5 working days in\nthe manner prescribed by the department.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The agency did not submit a special investigation to the\ndepartment’s licensing authority within 5 days of learning of the\nallegation.\nInvestigation Foster Care/ Licensing Supervisor reported Foster Parent\nmoved into Foster Parent’s Brother home on 11/25/2023 without\nthe knowledge of the Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices (MDHHS).

She stated Licensing Specialist was new\nto the licensing position and was learning his role. She said\nshe had supervision with Licensing Specialist on\n10/30/2023 and 11/20/2023 due to his primary supervisor\nbeing out on leave.

He reported he\ndid not share the information until his primary supervisor\nreturned from her leave because being new to the position,\nhe did not know he had to share that Foster Parent had\nmoved and to open a special investigation. He thought he\nonly had to complete an assessment of the new home.\nInterview with Foster Care Worker 2 (FCW 2) on 8/23/2024,\nfrom another agency who had full responsibility of Foster Child A.\nShe reported Foster Parent texted her on 11/25/2023, that she\nhad moved.
