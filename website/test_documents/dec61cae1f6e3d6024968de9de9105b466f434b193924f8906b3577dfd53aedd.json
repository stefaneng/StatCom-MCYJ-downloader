She had no additional licensing concerns.\nI interviewed Youth K jointly with Government Worker at school\non 5/17/24. He said Staff 1 pushed him into his room and “put his\nhands on me.” “I tried to get past him and said, ‘Don’t fucking\npush me.’ He put me in a head lock, and I grabbed his legs. We\nboth fell.” On the floor, Youth K said Staff 1 pushed down on his\nrib cage with both hands. “Staff 2 was there and did nothing…I\ntalked to police about the head lock.”\nYouth K was observed with no marks or bruises on his neck. He\nsaid his ribcage “still feels tight.” Government Worker contacted\nResidential Director and asked her to have Youth K picked up\nfrom school and seen by a doctor.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker on 5/21/24.\nHe has worked at the facility for five years. Staff 2 said another\nyouth was acting out in his bedroom, so he and Staff 1 cleared the\nyouth hallway of other residents asking them to go to their rooms\nfor safety. “Youth K got an attitude but went to his room.

To his\nknowledge, Youth K was not injured in any way and made no\nallegations of being mishandled at the time.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker on 5/21/24.\nHe has worked at the facility for four years and has no disciplinary\nwrite-ups in his personnel file. Government Worker read the\nallegations aloud. Staff 1 said a “clear the area” was called due to\nanother youth’s behavior. “Youth K did not want to comply (stay in\nhis room for his safety). I stood near his bedroom door. He\ngrabbed my leg and wrist. I struggled for balance and braced\nmyself off the ground. Staff 2 came and verbally redirected Youth\nK…Youth K did not fall or complain of pain.”\nStaff 1 denied pushing Youth K or being inside of his room. He\ndenied placing him in a headlock or pushing down on his chest or\nribcage. Staff 1 denied touching him at all.\nVideo:\nI viewed video of the long hallway on 5/15/24 from 7:26pm –\n7:34pm.

    "Government Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis Youth K had no marks or bruises after the alleged incident with\nStaff 1. The incident was not captured on video and both staff\npresent denied that Staff 1 pushed the youth, placed him in a\nheadlock or pressed down on his chest or ribcage.\nTwo days after the alleged incident, Youth K told investigators he\nwas experiencing pain in his ribcage.
