Staff would commonly\nbe asked to come over from the agency’s other CCI programs to\nhelp cover ratio.\nYouth I was interviewed on 05/29/2025 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. She believed it was common for\nthere not be enough staff present to meet ratio needs, causing\ninterruptions in the normal daily schedule. She recalled regularly\nhearing staff discussing how other staff from other CCI programs\non campus were needed to come assist and that could not always\noccur. An example she referred to was that there was a recent\nactivity where the youth were going to go to the on-site kitchen\nbuilding and do some baking but could not do so because there\nwas not enough staff.

She stated that her role as a\nclinician can technically count as part of the necessary ratio when\ninteracting with youth, she generally does not because she is in\nand out of the units during the day.

She\nalso witnessed four youth being supervised by one staff in one of\nthe units the day prior.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• The facility “Program Statement” last revised November\n2023 was provided and reviewed.

Youth B was escalated and Staff 5 felt\nthat the restraint attempt performed on her was warranted. Staff 8\ninitiated the restraint attempt and in doing so he was standing with\nYouth B standing as well and holding her wrist behind her. Staff 5\nwitnessed Staff 8 bending Youth B’s wrist back and it appeared to\nher that he was doing so as a means of controlling Youth B\nphysically. Staff 5 believed that it was evident this was not the\ncorrect manner of attempting the restraint because Youth B\nquickly stopped fighting back and was expressing being in\npain. When Staff 8 released Youth B’s wrist, Youth B fell to the\nground and Staff 5 attempted to help her back up. Staff 5 also\nnoted that at the beginning of the restraint attempt Staff 8 had\nahold of Staff 5’s hair on accident, and she believed that he was\nintending to grab the hair of Youth B.

He believed that Youth B did\nnot make any mention of her wrists hurting during the\nrestraint. Staff 8 stated he left the situation at the end of the\nrestraint and was not aware of anything Youth B said at that\ntime. Staff 8 described his strategy for using his hands during\nrestraints in that he tried to only use his fingers and not his full\nhand because he knew he was bigger and stronger than other\nstaff and did not want to risk hurting youth.\nVideo reviewed:\nSecurity camera footage from within one of the units of the facility\ndated 05/27/2025 was provided and reviewed.
