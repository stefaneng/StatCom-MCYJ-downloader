Youth A stated things are going\nwell for her at Myriam Hall, and she did not have concerns. Youth\nA was asked to explain the locking of her bedroom door. Youth A\nstated she is never locked in her bedroom at Myriam Hall. Youth A\nstated Myriam Hall bedroom doors can be locked from the outside\nbut are never locked from the inside. Youth A stated when she\nresided at Vista Maria – Rose Hall she was locked in her bedroom\nduring sleeping hours and one time she waited for maybe 30\nminutes until a male staff (did not recall) let her out of the bedroom\nto use the bathroom. Youth A stated she did not recall the month\nthis occurred, but it happened a long time ago.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 05/15/2025 at Vista Maria – Myriam\nHall. Staff 1 stated youth are not locked in their bedrooms during\nsleeping hours.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 05/15/2025 at Vista Maria – Rose Hall.\nStaff 2 stated youth bedroom doors used to be locked at bedtime\nand opened in the morning, but youth are no longer locked in their\nbedrooms during sleeping hours per administration directive.\nDocumentation\nThe following is from investigation 2025SIC0000172,\n2025SIC0000212 and 2025SIC0000213 written by Division of\nChild Welfare Licensing (DCWL) Consultant 2. It states Vista\nMaria administration confirmed on 12/12/2024 that youth were\nsecluded in their bedrooms during sleeping hours. Vista Maria\nadministration provided an email authored by Former DCWL\nConsultant that stated the agency could continue to lock youth in\ntheir bedrooms during sleeping hours for the purpose of safety.\nVista Maria was found in compliance based on the incorrect\ninformation provided by the Former DCWL Consultant. Vista Maria\nadministration agreed to develop a plan for youth to sleep in\nunlocked rooms by 01/31/2025.\nTour Observation\nStaff 1 permitted this Consultant to test the bedroom doors at\nVista Maria - Myriam Hall, which is a secure facility.

A second door from\nthe foyer to the living area is secured.\nStaff 2 permitted this consultant to test the bedroom doors at Vista\nMaria - Rose Hall, which is a secure facility. The bedroom doors\nare locked from the outside, but the bedroom doors open in one\negress motion from the inside. Rose Hall’s main entrance door\nopens freely when entering and exiting. A second door from the\nfoyer to the living area is secured.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance because 1) Youth A stated she\nwas locked in her bedroom a long time ago and youth were locked\nin their bedrooms during sleeping hours prior to 12/24/2024, and\n2) Staff 1 and Staff 2 reported youth do not currently sleep in\nsecured rooms.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following: (c)\nPolicies and procedures pertaining to admission, care, safety and\nsupervision methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Finding\nType\nAllegation Failure to update Sleeping Room Hours policy and procedure.\nInvestigation Documentation\nVista Maria’s Sleeping Room Hours policy and procedure POL-\n006-038 states “1. Residents are to observe sleeping hours\nbetween the following hours of 11pm-7am. During which time the\nbedroom doors are to be secured”. It further states “3. Residents\nmay be in sleeping rooms that are locked based on security and\nthe precautions for the program the residents reside in. In such\nsituations the room must be unsecured at the end of the\ndesignated sleeping hours”. It also states “4. Building requiring\nsecured rooms, will require all residents to have justification for\nnight security precautions documented in their initial treatment\nplan”.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance because their Sleeping\nRoom Hours policy and procedure POL-006-038 is not updated to\nreflect CCI Rule 400.4162 Seclusion within secure and nonsecure\nfacilities; seclusion plan; prohibitions; reduction and elimination.\n3",
    "(11) All seclusion will be prohibited effective November 1, 2022,\nand the agency’s current practice of not securing youth in their\nbedrooms during sleeping hours.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV.
