CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not in need of consultation.\n5",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility has submitted six acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The facility had ten special investigations\nduring this period under review. The investigations involved the facility performing\nunwarranted restraints, failure to report information to Centralized Intake,\ndocumentation of medical care not being completed consistently, not following\ninternal policies, and not completing variable room checks. The facility’s corrective\naction plan compliance is monitored quarterly, and they have completed all current\ncorrective action plans.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator reported staff turnover occurring at the houses, most recently\nthe supervisor at Sherk House putting in his notice. There are many employees\nworking at Ashmun and Sherk houses that have been employed for less than one\nyear. Another challenge identified was finding post placements for the youth in care.\nThere have been some youth placed at the houses that have been a challenge. The\nChief Administrator reported having to give a 30-day notice on a couple youth due to\nthe youths’ mental health needs. The management team has been providing a lot of\neducation to staff regarding licensing rules, policies and the “why” behind what Eagle\nVillage does. The facility has seen this as a positive tool for the staff. Corrective\naction plans have been implemented and changes have been made as needed.\nInterviews\nYouth reported in interviews feeling safe, understanding the rules of the house, and\nhaving a lot of activities available to them. One youth stated she knows the staff care\nabout them (kids) by the way they treat us. There were no concerns noted by any of\nthe youth interviewed. Staff reported many changes occurring in the house but\nfeeling with the newly assigned supervisor, things are now moving in a positive\ndirection. Staff stated they feel supported, receive regular training, and have weekly\nmeetings. One staff expressed concerns with how the restraint rules have changed\nand how the rules will be changing again.\n6",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nApril 19, 2022\n________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n________________April 20, 2022___________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
