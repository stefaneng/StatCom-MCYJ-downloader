Youth who are only ordered under the\nsupervision of the department, or those who are in guardianships and not\nordered under the care and supervision of the department do not meet the\nDCWL definition of \"foster child\" and therefore do not fall under DCWL\npurview and must not be included. Additionally, when providing the date the\nagency assumed case responsibility, that date must coincide with either the\ndate the youth was ordered under the care of the department or when the\nagency assumed responsibility of a case that was previously managed by\nanother agency with the applicable order already in place.",
