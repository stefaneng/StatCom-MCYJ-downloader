Youth Coach B\nreported she assisted with the search of the girls’ rooms. She\n5",
    "reported they searched Youths A, B, C, and D's rooms and did not\nfind the vape pens. Youth Coach B reported Youth B turned in the\nvape pens. Youth Coach B reported the girls seemed out of it and\nit was obvious something was going on with them. She reported\nthat Youth D's words were all jumbled up and her words didn't\nmake sense. Youth Coach B reported Youth A was very laid back\nand she is usually combative.\nI interviewed Youth Coach C on 3/20/23 via phone in collaboration\nwith the Government Worker. Youth Coach C reported that on\n2/22/23 the youth were in their rooms for personal time. When\npersonal time was over Youth A and Youth D didn't come out of\ntheir rooms right away. About 15 minutes later Youth A came out\nof her room and took her medication and was very calm and had a\nhoodie on. Youth D also came out of her room and was wearing a\nhoodie and was also very quiet. Youth Coach C noticed that Youth\nA and Youth D were frequently talking which was not the norm for\neither of them. Youth D asked Youth Coach C to get her some\nwater and Youth Coach C said she noticed that Youth D\nappeared high. Youth Coach C asked her why she looked like\nthat, and Youth D indicated it was her medication causing her to\nbe high. Youth Coach C reported she went and asked the Team\nLeader who said Youth D's medication does not affect her that\nway. Youth Coach C reported they then did room checks and did\nnot find anything. Youth Coach C reported Youth A told her the\nyouth that had used the vape pens. Youth B then turned over the\ntwo vape pens to Youth Coach C at the end of the shift. Youth\nCoach C reported she took the vape pens and gave them to the\nTeam Leader.\nI attempted to interview Youth E via phone on 3/20/23 in\ncollaboration with the Government Worker. Youth E was\ndischarged from the facility on 2/27/23. Youth E did not return the\ncall.\nI interviewed the Right's Officer at the facility on 3/14/23 in\ncollaboration with the Government Worker. He reported that the\nfacility attempted to drug screen the youth involved (Youths A, B,\nC and D). Youth D was positive for marijuana and the other three\nyouth's workers/or judge denied permission to test them.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\nI reviewed the facility’s policy on client privacy which details the\nsearch procedure. The search procedure is to have clients remove\ntheir shoes and socks and shake them out. The clients are to pull\nthe waistband of their pants out as well as their bra that encircles\n6",
    "their torso away from their body and they are to empty their\npockets.\nIncident report dated 2/22/23 completed by Team Leader A was\nreviewed. The report indicates that Youth Coach C informed\nTeam Leader A that the behaviors of Youth A and Youth D are\ncoming off as peculiar. Incident report indicates Youths A, B, D\nand E were passing around a vape pen while concealing it. Three\nof those residents' rooms were searched and nothing was found.\nYouth B turned over the two vape pens to Youth Coach C after the\nsearch of the rooms. One vape pen was cannabis, and the other\nwas nicotine.\nAnalysis Based upon the interviews there is no evidence that supports the\nstaff did not follow the agency search policy. The youth was able\nto conceal vape pens in her boot lining that search procedures did\nnot detect. All staff interviewed and Youth A described the search\nprocedure the same, and this is the procedure that was followed\nwhen searching Youth A.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The search of shoes/boots should\ninclude a staff member looking inside the youth’s footwear with a\nflashlight to ensure items are not being concealed in the lining or\nunder the shoe insert.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n______________________________________03/20/2023\nTracey Ventola Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/05/2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n7"
