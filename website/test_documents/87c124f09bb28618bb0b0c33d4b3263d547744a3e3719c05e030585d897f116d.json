CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nR400.12324 Reevaluation(2)(b)\n12",
    "The agency was advised when a supervisor serves as the case worker, ensuring\nthat the revaluation references that person’s correct role on the case may aid in\nshowing clearer compliance to the rule.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThis incident related to an initial allegation related to the foster parent having\ninsufficient income. During the investigation a second complaint surfaced that the\nfoster parent/relative had assaulted another relative in the present of the children. A\nknife which the foster parent/relative reported normally carrying on her person was\ninvolved and fell on the floor. During the investigation It was revealed the foster\nparent/relative had physically disciplined the children, by use of her hand or a back\nscratcher. The foster parent/caregiver admitted to a physical fight with her relative\nbut denied ever hitting the children with anything.\nThe foster home was found in violation of foster home rules, inclusive of the foster\nparent qualifications rule and behavior management rules. Revocation of the foster\nhome license was recommended. The agency appeared to have acted appropriately\nrelated the incident; and except for R400.12327(1)(a), for which the agency received a\ncitation, the agency adhered to timeframes and standard related to the special\nevaluation.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. However, there were two incidents of behavioral management violations.\nThe first incident related to an allegation that the foster parent called the foster child\ndumb and retarded. The children in the home reported the foster father was calling\nthe foster child(ren), dumb, dumbo, retarded and idiots. The foster father admitted to\ncalling the children dumb and dumbo’s, but stated he never meant the names he\nused in a malicious manner. A corrective action plan was developed with the foster\nhome that entailed a re-review/signing of the agency’s behavior management policy.\nAdditionally, the foster parents were to complete a training titled Sensible discipline.\nThe foster parents were also required to complete a quiz at the end of the training\nand submit it to the agency’s licensing department.\nThe second incident related to an allegation that foster mother was advised what to\nsay to get a foster child removed from her home. Additionally, that the foster mother\nwas separating a previous foster child off from the foster father, whom the foster\nchild was close to, due to the foster parents’ adopted child feeling left out. Further,\nthat the foster mother was mean, would yell a lot at that foster child and send him to\nhis room. There special evaluation found insufficient evidence to support the\nallegations. Yet during the special evaluation it was revealed the foster parents\nutilized inappropriate discipline. “Daddy time out” was used, which involved the\nfoster parent placing a leg over the child, as if to restraint the child. The foster\n13",
    "parents were also calling a foster child a name other than her birth name, after the\nfoster care worker had instructed them not to on two separation occasions. The\nfoster parents were found in violation of the behavior management policy and foster\nparent qualification related to a willingness and ability to comply with licensing rules.\nA corrective action plan was developed with the foster parents that entailed the\nfoster parent re-reviewing/signing the agency’s behavior management policy.\nThe agency appeared to have acted appropriately related to these incidents and\nadhered to Departmental timeframes related to special evaluations. However, the\nagency received violations related to R400.12327(6)(c) and (7) as documented\nearlier in this report. Technical assistance and consultation was also provided\nrelated to R400.12327, as indicated above.\nThe agency has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first corrective action plan related to the agency’s Renewal Inspection, where it\nreceived several rules, ISEP and policy violations. Despite a reduction in the\nnumber of violations cited in this Interim Inspection report, the agency was not\nsuccessful with its corrective action plan as indicated by the number of repeat rule\nviolations. The agency experienced significant staff changes, since the last\nInspection review. Eight new staff (Two adoption workers, four foster workers and a\nlicensing worker) came aboard, in addition to them adding a foster care/independent\nliving supervisor. The agency also acquired a new Chief Executive Officer. The\nagency appears hopefully related to maintaining these staff and improving its\nperformance.\nThe second corrective action plan related to Special Investigation 2017C0420031,\ninitiated 5/30/17. The complaint alleged the agency was not conducting proper\nFTMs; siblings had not had a visit with one another in four months, and the agency\nwas not providing correct information to court on the birth mother’s progress, nor\ninforming the birth mother with information related to her children’s doctor\nappointments and therapy referrals. Additionally, that the children’s photographs\nwere used in the agency newsletter with the foster parent.\nThe agency was not found in violation of the latter two allegations which pertained to\nR400.12207(3)(a) or R400.12211 for Privacy safeguard. The special investigation\nfound the agency in violation of R400.12421(d) for Visitation and parenting time;\nContract/Policy standard FOM 722-6B for Family Team Meetings; and FOM 722-6 H\nfor Casework contacts. The agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan\non 8/17/17. The agency was not totally successful with this corrective action plan, in\nthat it received a citation related to FOM 722-6B this Interim Inspection.\nThe third corrective action plan related to Special Investigation 2017C0420049,\ninitiated 7/25/17. The complaint alleged the agency allowed the foster parents to\nbaptize the foster children without a written consent from the birth parent. The\nspecial investigation substantiated the allegation and the agency was found in\n14",
    "violation of R 400.12314 for Religion policy. The agency submitted an acceptable\ncorrective action plan on 10/2/17, which indicated the agency’s policy was updated\nto ensure written consent is received from biological parents before allowing a foster\nparent to baptize a foster child. Additionally, that all staff were apprised of the\nupdated policy.\nThe agency remains incompliance with this corrective action plan.\nBCAL ANALYST CONCERNS:\n-Concern: The foster care worker has only made an unannounced home visit to the\nfoster home once or twice a year.\nResolution: The case record showed required quarterly unannounced foster home\nvisits were not documented/completed as required by policy. The agency received a\ncitation for MDHHS (Michigan Department of Health and Humans Services) policy 722-\n6H for Unannounced home visits. The agency will provide a corrective action plan to\naddress this issue.\nConcern: The foster parent did not receive the medical passport.\nResolution: MISACWIS documented that the foster parent received the medical\npassport after the child’s initial placement on 4/7/15. Four unsigned medical passports\nwere documented in the MISACWIS record, but verification that the foster received a\ncopy of the child’s updated medical passports was not. The agency received\na violation under ISEP 6.49 for Medical passport. The agency will provide the foster\nparent within an updated medical passport with fifteen days of receipt of this Interim\nreport. The agency will provide a corrective action plan to address this issue on an\nongoing basis.\nConcern: The foster parent has not provided input or signed the treatment plan.\nResolution: Review of the foster child’s service plans indicated input and information\nreported by the foster parent. The foster parent signed treatment plans 3/18/17-6/15/17\nand 6/16/17- 9/13/17 treatment plan, but not the 9/14/17-12/17 treatment plan. The\nagency was cited under MDHHS policy FOM 722-8C for Foster care- Parent Agency\nTreatment Plan & Service Agreement. The agency will provide a corrective action plan\naddressing this issue.\n-Concern: The foster care worker has not made an unannounced home visit since the\nchild’s placement.\nResolution: The agency reported, and the record showed the agency received the case\n7/22/16. The record documented several foster home visits, since then and two\nattempted unannounced foster home visits (5/3/17and 8/3/17). The agency received a\nviolation under MDHHS policy FOM 722-6H for Unannounced home visits. The agency\nwill provide a corrective action plan to address this issue.\nConcern: The foster parent did not receive the child’s medical passport.\n15",
    "Resolution: The child’s record showed the relative foster parent had provided care to\nthis child for years prior to becoming licensed 7/22/16. MISACWIS showed the relative\nfoster parent was provided the medical passport 7/22/16. Quarterly updated medical\npassports were not documented.
