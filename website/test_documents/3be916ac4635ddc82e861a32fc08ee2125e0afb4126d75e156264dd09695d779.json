The source provided documentation regarding\nthe foster care case to support the allegation. The documentation was reviewed prior\nto contacting the agency to initiate the investigation.\nChief Administrator\nOn 11/22/2021 the agency’s Chief Administrator was contacted and notified of the\nallegation. The CA reported the agency was aware of the possible violation and\nprovided contact information for the Foster Care Worker(FCW) and the Program\nManager(PM) as she was involved in the case prior to the FCW.\nFoster Care Worker & Program Manager\nOn 12/8/2021 a joint interview was conducted with the FCW and PM. The PM\nreported she had a longer history with the case as the FCW was just assigned to it in\nAugust 2021. The PM reported the younger siblings were placed with one another\nuntil August 2021, therefore no sibling visits were required. However, during a recent\ncourt hearing it was identified there were missed visitation opportunities for the two\nyounger children with their older sibling, Child C. The PM stated Child C was in\nmultiple placements including hospitalization due to a suicide attempt, detention, and\n2",
    "AWOL. As Child C was not always stable, visits were not pursued. The PM\nrecognized the agency should have thoroughly documented Child C’s inability or\nunwillingness to have sibling visits. The PM gave the example of August 2021\nspecifically, a visit did not occur as Child A was in crisis and Child C had just\nreturned from AWOL and did not want to see his siblings. While the agency felt there\nwere sufficient reasons not to have a sibling visit that month, the agency also\nacknowledged they should have had more thorough documentation in MiSACWIS.\nThe PM stated Child C had not been refusing visits, but he generally preferred to “do\nhis own thing” such as spend time with his girlfriend, rather than attend sibling visits.\nThe agency was reminded to review FOM 722-06I to ensure they are following the\nrequirements for documentation when visitation does not occur.\nThe FCW reported when she was assigned to the case in August 2021, she\nrecognized some things were missed. Since that time, she has worked to get things\non track and feels a lot of progress has been made. It was noted during the last\ncourt hearing, the judge was happy with the progress in the case.\nThe FCW and PM were informed that DCWL reviewed the youth’s placement\nhistory. It was found that Child C had multiple placements due to jail/detention,\nAWOL, and hospitalization, which made visits difficult. However, during Youth C’s\nplacement in residential from 3/31/21 to 6/1/21, and placement in Independent Living\nfrom 7/29/21 to 10/23/21 sibling visit attempts should have occurred and been\ndocumented. The PM acknowledged this missed opportunity and stated they have\nnew plans in place and do not anticipate further difficulties in meeting the\nrequirements for sibling visits.\nDocuments reviewed\nReporting source documentation indicated the following:\n During a court hearing on 9/29/21, the judge expressed concern about the\nlack of sibling visits completed between Child A, Child B, and Child C. The\ncourt ordered sibling contact to be arranged by the agency and occur at least\nonce per month.\n The FCW was interviewed and reported a formal visitation schedule had not\nbeen arranged. The FCW reported some barriers to in person visits, such as\ntransportation barriers and Youth C being in crisis at times, or not wishing to\nvisit. Stating that phone and video calls were also used to keep the siblings\nconnected.\n The Program Manager was interviewed and reported phone communication\noccurred at times. However, Child C was in crisis for much of the past year,\nwhich affected visits.\n Sibling visits were not entered into MiSACWIS from 12/21/2020 to 9/29/2021.\nA MiSACWIS case review determined the following:\n Sibling visits are required to occur monthly, per court order and policy.\n Child A and B were placed together from 5/16/19-8/18/21. On 8/18/21, Youth\nA moved to a relative caregiver.\n3",
    " Sibling visits were documented for Youth A and B on 9/24/21 and 10/29/21.\nNo sibling visits were documented for Youth C.\n Youth C’s placements were as follows: Detention 11/17/20-2/10/21, Licensed\nFH 2/10/21-2/15/21, Hospital 2/15-2/19/21, Hospital 2/19/21-3/5/21, Jail 3/5-\n3/23/21, Detention 3/23/21-3/31/21, Residential 3/31/21-6/1/21, AWOL\n6/1/21-7/29/21, Independent Living 7/29/21-10/23/21, AWOL 10/23/21-\n10/24/21, Independent Living 10/24/21- present.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time\nAn agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nparenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the\nfollowing: (d) Provisions for visits between siblings who are\nnot placed together except when there is a court\ndetermination that visits are detrimental to either child.\nANALYSIS: A violation was determined due to missing sibling visits and a\nlack of documentation regarding attempts to complete visits.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe agency was reminded to review FOM 722-06I to ensure\nthey are following the requirements for documentation when\nvisitation does not occur.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\n_ ___________December 14, 2021______________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 14, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
