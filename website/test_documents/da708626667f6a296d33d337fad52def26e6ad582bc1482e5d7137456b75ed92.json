METHODOLOGY\n07/25/2022 Special Investigation Intake\n2022C0106009\n07/26/2022 Special Investigation Initiated - Telephone\nTelephone interview with DHHS Program Manager 1.\n07/26/2022 Contact - Telephone call made\nTelephone interview with DHHS Analyst 1.\n07/28/2022 Inspection Completed On-site\nInterviewed Foster Care Manager 1.\n09/06/2022 Exit Conference\nExit Conference with Administrator 1.\nALLEGATION: Facility maintained an inaccurate placement record, resulting in\noverpayment.\nINVESTIGATION:\nAllegation was made that the agency was improperly billing the treatment foster care\nrate for Youth A who was being supervised in a foster home that was not a treatment\nfoster care home.\nI interviewed DHHS Program Manager 1 by telephone on 07/26/2022. DHHS Program\nManager 1 provided contact information for DHHS Analyst 1 and FC Manager 1. DHHS\nProgram Manager 1 stated the agency is cooperative with working with DHHS to\nresolve the funding billing process.\nI interviewed DHHS Analyst 1 by telephone on 07/26/2022. DHHS Analyst 1 stated it\nwas discovered that the agency was improperly billing for Youth A starting May 23,\n2022. DHHS Analyst 1 stated they had a meeting with the agency on 07/13/2022 to\naddress/resolve the incorrect billing issue. DHHS Analyst 1 stated the last time period\nof the billing error was 06/22/2022. DHHS Analyst 1 stated the agency was fully\n2",
    "cooperative in working to correct the error. DHHS Analyst 1 reported the agency was\nproviding the additional supervision associated with a treatment foster care placement\nso the agency thought they could bill that additional rate even though the foster home\nplacement itself was not identified as a treatment foster home.\nI interviewed Foster Care Manager 1 at the agency on 07/28/2022. Foster Care\nManager 1 reported the situation similar to the description provided by DHHS Analyst 1.\nFoster Care Manager 1 stated the situation was corrected by 07/15/2022 following the\nmeeting with DHHS on 07/13/2022. Foster Care Manager 1 stated in the future they\nwould discuss a situation with DHHS Analyst 1 if there were any questions/concerns.\nI completed an exit conference by telephone with Administrator 1. Administrator 1\nreported the funding issue had been corrected and everyone has received the proper\ncompensation.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 903-03 Payment for Foster Family/Relative Care\nFund sources are generated through service authorizations\nthat are routed, approved and amended in MISACWIS.\nANALYSIS: The agency had a misunderstanding of the criteria associated\nwith the funding source in this situation. The agency was\nproviding the level of supervision associated with the\nexpectations of one funding source and thought that was\nadequate to bill for services accordingly. However, in this\nsituation the foster home providing placement did not meet all\nthe criteria so the billing that was processed was not\nappropriate. The error was identified during the DHHS\nmonitoring process and a meeting was held to initiate corrective\naction. The agency was cooperative in the correction process.\nBoth DHHS monitors and agency representatives reported the\nerror has been corrected and the current billing is appropriate.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend with the submission and acceptance of an approved corrective action\nplan the current license status of this child placing agency -private be maintained.\n09/07/2022\n________________________________________\nMark R.
