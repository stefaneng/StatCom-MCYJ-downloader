She\nstated that she had heard from her daughter that someone with\nthe same last name as Staff 1 I had said something to Youth A\nthat made her uncomfortable after showering.\nYouth A was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nunannounced in person visit to the facility on 03/03/2023. Youth A\nwas able to describe a specific staff member, and eventually\nstated it was Staff 1 that has made her uncomfortable during her\ntime placed at the facility. She stated that she felt like he looked at\nher inappropriately when he did visuals in their rooms and after\nshowers. Youth A clarified that she didn’t think he or any other\nstaff had ever looked into the shower area when she was in there.\nYouth A described this as “weird vibes”. Youth A confirmed that\nStaff 1 had never touched her or said anything sexually explicit to\nher but specified that she just felt like he looked at her funny, and\nthat there were other youth that felt the same.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nunannounced in person visit to the facility on 03/03/2023. She\nprovided documentation on the facility’s shower policy for\nemployees and provided a tour of one of the units to view the\nshower area. Each unit has a separated shower area because\nthe individual rooms have bathrooms for youth’s use. The shower\narea is accessed behind a door with a window in it. That window\nhas a cover on the outside of the door that staff use to provide\nprivacy to the youth showering. It was described that two staff are\nalways present during showering, one at the door facing away\nfrom the window and another elsewhere in the unit. They then\nonly enter the shower area after the youth has clothed and exited\nin order to disinfect for the next use.\nYouth B was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n03/15/2023. She stated Staff 1 made comments in her time\nplaced at the facility that made her uncomfortable. She stated that\nshe heard Staff 1 say to her “I like your smile” on a couple\n2",
    "different occasions as an example. Youth B also felt like Staff 1\nstared at her at times. Youth B recalled that Staff 1 worked the\nshower shifts often. She stated that Staff 1 never went into the\nshower area during times it was being used, nor did any other\nstaff.\nYouth C was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n03/15/2023. She stated that she had no concerns with the\nprocedure used for showering at the facility and that she didn’t\nthink any staff had ever looked into the shower area when she\nwas in there. She could not recall a time that the window was not\ncovered or that her privacy felt invaded in anyway. Youth C did\nrefer to Staff 1 as someone that has made “weird comments” in\nthe past, such as something to the effect of “I like your hair down,\nit is pretty” or calling her a “good girl” when she followed\ndirections.

Staff 1 denied ever having done anything\ninappropriate to any youth that has been placed at the facility. He\nstated that he has worked there for years and that this is the first\ntime he has heard of such allegations, but no one made them\ndirectly to him. Staff 1 admitted that it is possible that his positive\nattitude towards the youth could be misconstrued, and also that he\nworks hard to have all youth follow the rules of the facility and this\nwould not be the first time there were youth placed that had a\nproblem with him in that regard. Staff 1 stated that he has never\ntouched a youth inappropriately nor has he intentionally looked at\nany youth inappropriately. He stated he does work the shower\nprocess at times in the male and female units but that the process\nis designed as such to not allow any staff to see youth as they are\ngetting out of the shower or getting dressed.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• The personnel file of Staff 1 was reviewed and had no\nincidents of discipline that would cause concern in this\ninvestigation.\n3",
    "• An internal investigation conducted and authored by\nSupervisor 1 dated 03/02/2023 was reviewed. In this\ninvestigation allegations were presented by Youth A about\na staff member that may have viewed her in the shower,\nbut Youth A never identified any specific staff at that time.\nThe facility closed their investigation with no findings.\n• The facility’s shower procedure policy was reviewed. It is\nrequired that two staff members at all times are present\nwhen youth are showering to ensure no one is alone with\nyouth. The shower areas are built so that any youth\nshowering cannot be seen beyond a wall, and there is a\nwindow with an external covering used by staff to ensure\nprivacy of the youth. There is no video surveillance of the\nshower area, but there is an exterior door to the shower\nand any staff working that area can be seen on camera.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews of youth and staff as well as\ndocuments reviewed there are no violations found for this rule.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10149\nSection (2) A facility shall provide or make available the following\nDescription minimum programs and services to residents:\n(c) Counseling\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A was denied access to her mental health clinician while\nplaced at the facility.\nInvestigation Youth A's parent was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nunannounced in person visit to the facility on 03/03/2023. She\nstated that she had heard from Youth A previously that her\ntherapist had come to have an appointment with her while placed\nat the facility and was turned away. In addition, Youth A's parent\nstated that the therapist was not able to schedule an appointment\nwhile at the facility that day.\nYouth A was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nunannounced in person visit to the facility on 03/03/2023. She\nstated that she did not believe she had ever been denied access\nto her therapist during her time placed at the facility. She recalled\nbeing informed that her therapist came on a day when there was a\nlot going on and was not able to see her, but Youth A did not see\nthis as a problem.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker\n1 on 03/15/2023. She stated that she had direct involvement with\nYouth A and her therapist from the local mental health authority\n4",
    "who visited on that date in February as alleged. Supervisor 2\nstated that she made the decision jointly with the therapist that\nday, to not have Youth A come out of the unit to meet with her\nbecause Youth A was significantly escalated and already had to\nbe restrained and secluded during times of the day because of\ndangerous and chaotic behavior. Part of Supervisor 2’s concern\nwas that the facility has specified areas where youth meet with\nfamily, attorneys, mental health professionals, etc. and that Youth\nA had a history of becoming escalated in those areas of the\nbuilding and being aggressive towards those visitors as well as\nherself and staff. Supervisor 2 recalled an occurrence in October\n2022 where Youth A was in the lobby of the facility with her\nmother and other individuals, and she became so escalated that\nshe injured staff and caused significant property damage and that\nstaff and security had trouble managing the situation because of\nthe less secured, public location of the incident. Supervisor 2\nstated that it was not safe to have the visiting therapist on the unit\nwith Youth A that day, even if it was possible that the therapist\nmight have been able to help de-escalate Youth A. Supervisor 2\nrecalled that the therapist was agreeable and understanding of\nthis plan to schedule another time.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews of youth and staff there are no\nviolations found for this rule.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10157 Health Services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) A facility shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures that address all of the following:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A had prescribed medication that was not provided to her\nwhile placed at the facility.\nInvestigation Youth A's parent was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nunannounced in person visit to the facility on 03/03/2023. She\nstated that back in December Youth A stated that she was not\nable to take a prescription, possibly Clonidine, because she had\nlow bread pressure. Youth A's parent stated that she did not hear\nany follow up on this issue afterwards.\nNurse 1 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n03/13/2023. She confirmed that she does not prescribe the\nmedication the youth at the facility take, that medication is\nprescribed by primary care physicians and psychologists outside\nof their facility. She is responsible, however, for managing the\ndistribution of that medication. Nurse 1 stated that she recalled\n5",
    "the issue of Youth A’s medication back in December and\nexplained. She stated she worked with Youth A’s primary care\nphysician who required that Youth A’s blood pressure be checked\nbefore taking a new dosage of Clonidine around that time, and\nthere were several occasions where Youth A’s blood pressure\nwas not within the specified range to safely take the medication.\nAfter some time monitoring the situation Nurse 1 stated that she\nwas able to have a lower, and more safe, dosage of the\nmedication prescribed so it could be provided to Youth A.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Medical documentation from the facility provided by\nNurse 1 that was consistent with her interview. There\nwas concern over Youth A’s blood pressure while taking\nClonidine during the month of December. This\ndocumentation confirmed how that was addressed for\nYouth A through faxes from the youth’s primary care\nphysician confirming that the medication administration\nshould be altered for the youth’s safety. The primary\ncare physician stated on 12/16/2022 that Clonidine\nshould be discontinued and then re-instated this\nmedication at a lower dose on 12/21/2022.\n• Medication Administration Record for Youth A for the\nmonth of December 2022. This was consistent with the\ninstructions provided to the facility by Youth A’s primary\ncare physician.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews of youth and staff as well as\ndocuments reviewed there are no violations found for this rule.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
