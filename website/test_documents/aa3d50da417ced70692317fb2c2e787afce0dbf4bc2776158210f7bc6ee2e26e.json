    "ALLEGATION:\nStaff member at agency took youth to the store at an unknown date. During this\ntime, staff member attempted to hug youth and grab youth's penis.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/12/2022 I received a complaint alleging that Staff 1 had made an inappropriate\nsexual advance toward Youth A while the two were alone in Staff 1’s car.\nYouth A - On 1/14/2022 I joined DHHS Worker by phone as she interviewed Youth\nA in person. Youth A stated that he did not want to discuss details of the allegation.\nHe stated that another youth in the home must have reported the incident after\nhearing Youth A talk about it, because Youth A never wanted to report this. Youth A\nstated that on 12/31/21 at approximately 5:00PM he went to the store with Staff 1 in\nStaff 1’s car. While seat belted in the car, Staff 1 “made a sexual advance” toward\nYouth A by touching his upper left thigh. Youth A responded by saying “we’re not\ngoing to do that” after which Staff 1 acted embarrassed. Youth A stated that Staff 1\nworked until 11:00PM that night and there were no further incidents or discussion\nabout what happened in the car. Youth A reported he has not had any other\nconcerns with Staff 1 and hasn’t heard of any other youth in the home having\nconcerns with her either.\nOn 3/1/2022 we attempted to speak with Youth A again; however, Youth A had told\nstaff that he did not want to talk to us again and left the home.\nDHHS Worker - On 2/15/2022 I talked with DHHS Worker by phone. DHHS Worker\nreported Staff 1 was interviewed in person at the police station along with a\ndetective. DHHS Worker shared other concerning statements made by Staff 1 during\nher interview regarding Youth A’s alcohol use in the home while Staff 1 was present,\nstaff and youth being afraid of Youth A, and Supervisor 1’s lack of responsiveness.\nDHHS Worker also reported, during Staff 1’s interview with the DHHS Worker and\ndetective, Staff 1 made concerning statements about personal self-harm and stated\nthat she was going to a local mental health facility.\nStaff 1 - On 3/11/2022 I interviewed Staff 1 via video conferencing. DHHS Worker\nalso participated in this interview. Staff 1 stated she drove Youth A to Family Fare on\n12/31/2021 but denied having any sexual conversations with him and denied\ntouching his thigh, leg, or penis. She stated her “theory” is that Youth A is making\nthe allegation because she called 911 on Youth A for a wellness check and he likely\nfigured out who made the call. She did; however, admit to sitting in her car with\nYouth A smoking cigarettes and listening to music together. Staff 1 was asked if\nyouth were allowed to smoke with staff, particularly since Youth A is 16 and not of\nlegal age to have cigarettes to which she replied that it was not allowed, but that\nSupervisor 1 had stated she knew Youth A smoked and drank. Staff 1 stated she\nwould take 1 -2 smoke breaks during her shift and “eventually,” while she was on the\nback porch Youth A came out and asked if he could go out there with her, which she\nallowed. She added that he had his own cigarettes and that she did not provide any\n3",
    "for him, but he would join her for her smoke breaks and smoke with her. She also\nadmitted to having taken cigarettes that were in the staff office after being\nconfiscated from a youth, bringing them home, and smoking them herself.\nStaff 1 was asked about Youth A’s drinking in the home. She stated that he was\nsmoking and drinking at the home from the time she started working there so she\njust assumed that was “how it was.” She stated she didn’t know if other staff or\nsupervision knew about his smoking and drinking at the home, but she did know that\nStaff 2 had confiscated cigarettes from Youth A. Staff 1 reported Youth A’s drinking\nstarted “little by little.” She stated the first instance was while he was cooking dinner.\nStaff 1 stated another staff member had taken him shopping earlier, prior to Staff 1\ntaking over the shift, and Youth A had a grocery bag with a case of beer which he\ntold Staff 1 was for cooking. Staff 1 stated she doesn’t know how Youth A got the\nbeer or if the other staff knew about it. Staff 1 stated she doesn’t know if Youth A\nwas “testing” her by bringing in the beer. Staff 1 stated she was never trained on\nwhat to do in this situation and that, from there he just kept bringing in alcohol and\ndrinking. She stated no one had informed her that he had a substance use issue and\nshe never received a “run down” on Youth A. She reported she had been trained for\n2 days by Program Trainer, but she stated that she felt like she needed more\ntraining, so Program Trainer provided her an additional day of training. She reported\nno one went over protocol. She also admitted she never asked the trainer, other\nstaff, or her supervisor what to do after the first incident when Youth A had beer in\nthe home.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A had offered her alcohol at the home, but she didn’t accept.\nShe stated he proceeded drink in front of her. She reported he would use beer in his\nmeals while cooking dinner then finish the can. She stated she knew the youth\nweren’t supposed to be drinking, but it was happening, so she thought it was ok. She\nstated that on 12/27/2021 she heard “hacking” and a “big thud” and found Youth A\nface down in the hallway dry heaving, so she “poked him awake.” She stated he\nstumbled away. She stated she heard him become “violently ill.” She texted\nSupervisor 1 that Youth A was intoxicated but she did not get a response. She\nstated she always filled out her staff notes about 1 ½ -2 hours before the end of her\nshift and was 99% sure she completed her notes about this incident.\nStaff 1 also reported an incident when Youth A was intoxicated and flicking a lighter\nattempting to burn one of the couches. She stated she believed he was getting to a\npoint of overdosing, but she did not reach out to the police, medical, or emergency\nservices. She then added, “thinking back I was never instructed what to do when\nthey are suicidal or overdose.” She stated there was a binder in the office which\nincluded staff procedures, but she found that on her own while sitting at the staff\ndesk 3-4 weeks into her employment. She stated she found all of the protocol and\nprocedures in the binder at that time. Staff 1 reported she never had an actual\nconversation with Supervisor 1 until a “few weeks” into her employment.\n4",
    "Staff 1 reported on 12/31/2021 she thought she heard Youth A “violently ill,” but she\nwasn’t sure, so she left work. She reported there was another time when she\ntransported him that he was intoxicated. She also stated there was a time that she\nsaw him drop something that she thought might have been cocaine, but she wasn’t\nsure. She stated that she didn’t report this to anyone.\nStaff 1 was asked about calling the police on Youth A. She reported, when she left\nwork that day, he seemed suicidal, and she went home where she debated and\nweighed the fear of what he would do if she called the police against his safety and\nultimately decided to call the police. Staff 1 was asked why she didn’t tell anyone\nshe was calling 911 and she stated she talked with Supervisor 1 about Youth A’s\nbehaviors and Supervisor 1 told Staff 1 to leave Youth A alone. She reported she\ntexted Supervisor 1 on the night she called 911 and Supervisor 1 attempted to call\nher, but Staff 1 was charging her phone and wasn’t able to answer. Supervisor 1 did\ntext to ask with whom Staff 1 was having concerns and when Staff 1 replied with\nYouth A’s name, Supervisor 1 stopped responding. She stated she did not have a\nchance to document anything about Youth A’s behavior that night because she had\nalready typed her notes before he started making what she described as suicidal\nand homicidal statements.\nStaff 1 stated she was concerned for the safety of the youth and had never had a job\nlike this before. She stated she was “just trying to figure it out.” She stated things\nmight have been better if she was trained directly by Supervisor 1. She reported she\nwasn’t sure if this was the job for her right away and that she wasn’t comfortable\nbeing the only staff working with clients. She stated she never wants a job like that\nagain and will always have a co-worker with her to “hold me accountable and to\nconfide in.”\nOn 3/14/2022 I received and reviewed an email from Staff 1 in which she reported\nthat she interviewed for her position at the agency on 11/15/2021 with Program\nSupervisor who discussed topics such as youth using tobacco and marijuana during\ntheir stay at the home. Staff 1 reported Program Supervisor expresses that she\nwasn’t concerned with this and does not view these things as illegal despite the\nyouth being under the age of 21 and that the police don’t take it seriously either.\nStaff 1 reported Program Supervisor told her about a youth using heroin in one of\nthe homes, which Program Supervisor knowingly allowed. Staff 1 also reported on\n12/21/2021, Supervisor 1 and Program Supervisor were at the home setting up a\nChristmas tree for a holiday decorating competition when Staff 1 arrived to work at\n3:00 PM. Staff 1 reported Youth A was drinking something from a cup in front of\neveryone and could not hold a conversation without laughing, could not walk\nstraight, and was leaning on door frames to hold himself up. She reported Youth A\ncould not participate in the decorating because he knocked over anything he\ntouched and at one point fell to the floor while staff, including Supervisor 1, laughed\nat him rather than helping him up. Staff 1 reported the decorating was live streamed\nto other agency homes and Youth A was unable to participate because “his\n5",
    "condition had worsened.” She reported after the competitions, he continued to drink\nout of his cup while eating pizza with Supervisor 1 and the other staff and youth.\nSupervisor 1 - On 1/17/2022 (in person,) 3/1/2022 (by phone,) and 3/15/2022\n(virtually,) I interviewed Supervisor 1. Supervisor 1 reported she was Staff 1’s\nsupervisor and is also Youth A’s case manager. Supervisor 1 reported she became\naware of this allegation when she was told by a staff member that another youth in\nthe home reported Youth A made the allegation while the youth were in a group\nsetting. Supervisor indicated Staff 1 worked for the agency for 1.5 – 2 months and\ndidn’t work many shifts. Supervisor 1 was asked about the home policy regarding\nstaff transporting youth and she reported staff are supposed to get permission\nbefore transporting youth and there should always be at least two youth in the car\nwhen staff do transport. She stated there is a binder in the staff office which contains\nstaff procedures including what to do when staff find drugs or alcohol in the home,\nyouth are intoxicated, or youth become violent or suicidal.\nSupervisor 1 was asked about Youth A’s substance use. Supervisor 1 stated she\nhad talked with Staff 1 about Youth A’s substance abuse history and his\nsusceptibility to relapse, so Staff 1 would not have had any reason to believe it was\nacceptable for him to drink in the home. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A has relapsed\ndue to the stress of this investigation. DHHS Worker reported to Supervisor 1 she\nhad spoken with Youth A’s probation officer who told DHHS Worker that Youth A\nrelapsed prior to this investigation initiation and admitted to drinking every day for a\nmonth. Additionally, staff reported his use in the home prior to this investigation.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A self-disclosed a relapse with alcohol on 2/1/2022. At\nthat time, his services were enhanced by adding a second therapist and a mentor.\nYouth A also has a probation officer who implemented community service based on\nthe relapse. Supervisor 1 reported they have team meetings every two weeks during\nwhich they discuss the needs and concerns of each youth in the home; however,\nStaff 1 did not attend the majority of the meetings held while she was employed.\nShe reported that she was not aware of Youth A drinking in the home while Staff 1\nwas present at any time. She stated Staff 1’s reports about Youth A being\nintoxicated during the Christmas tree decorating are untrue. She stated Youth A did\nparticipate in the decorating and the live stream event. She reported he was drinking\nsoda during the event, not alcohol.\nSupervisor 1 was asked about the incident when Staff 1 called the police on Youth\nA. Supervisor 1 stated she doesn’t know why Staff 1 called for a welfare check on\nYouth A as she had not contacted Supervisor 1 or anyone else to express any\nconcerns. Supervisor 1 stated Youth A was assessed at the emergency room and\ndeemed to not be threat to himself or others, so he was brought back to the home.\nDHHS Worker asked Supervisor 1 if she was aware that Youth A was intoxicated\nwhen he was taken to the emergency room, and she stated that she reviewed the\nmedical paperwork but “must have missed that.”\n6",
    "Supervisor 1 stated she has talked to all of the youth in the home, and no one is\nafraid of Youth A. Additionally, she stated Program Manager is adamant about\npressing charges if staff feel threatened and no one has expressed feeling\nthreatened by Youth A. Supervisor 1 stated any staff who have had any concerns\nwith Youth A for any reason have let Supervisor 1 know. Supervisor 1 stated when\nYouth A is observed pacing around, panicing, repeating himself, staring off, and\nupset, Youth A can seem scary when he is acting this way, but that he is not a\nthreat. She stated she has never seen him physically aggressive or express suicidal\nor homicidal statement. She stated staff should be documenting these behaviors if\nthey are occurring, but there has been nothing of this nature in case notes.\nProgram Manager - On 1/17/2022 I interviewed Program Manager 1 on-site.\nProgram Manager reported she had a phone conversation with Staff 1 on 1/12/2022\nduring which Staff 1 reported Youth B is afraid of Youth A. Staff 1 did not talk about\nany other youth or any other concerns during her call with Program Manager.\nProgram Manager reported no other staff or youth share the concerns about Youth A\nexpressed by Staff 1.\nDuring my interview of Program Manager and Supervisor 1, I was able to put\ntogether the following timeline of events based on their reports regarding the\nallegations:\nFriday 12/31/21\n Approximately 5:00PM: Allegedly, Staff 1 drove Youth A to Family Fare.\n 11:00 PM: Staff 1’s shift is over, and she leaves.\n Shortly after 11 PM: Third shift staff catch Youth A with a 6 pack of beer in his\nroom.\nMonday 1/3/22\n 3:00 PM Staff 1 works for the first time since 12/31/21.\n The home supervisor notifies the staff that Youth A was found with the beer on\n12/31/21.\n 5:00 PM Staff 1 calls police reporting concerns that Youth A has made suicidal\nand homicidal comments. Staff 1 does not tell anyone she made this call despite\nbeing at work.\n 7:00 PM Staff 1’s shift ends, and she goes home.\n Later that evening, Staff 1 calls Supervisor 1 to report that she is unable to sleep\nbecause she does not feel that the home is safe with Youth A there and she is\nconcerned Youth A will slit the third shift staff throats, despite third shift staff not\nworking for another 3 days.\n Supervisor tells Staff 1 she will leave her phone on all night in case Staff 1\nneeded anything, but Staff 1 never calls.\n 10:00 PM The police arrive at the home. Youth A has no idea why he is taken\naway. He is assessed at the hospital for the report of mental health concerns and\nis brought back to the home 2 hours later.\n7",
    " Supervisor 1 calls Staff 1 to ask why she never told anyone she had called the\npolice at 5PM. Staff 1 is hyper-focused on the fact that Youth A is back at the\nhome and insists he needs to go to jail.\n Staff 1 refuses to work her next 3 scheduled shifts claiming she does not feel\nsafe.\n Program Supervisor informs Staff 1 that agency policy indicates that three no-\nshows result in termination.\n Staff 1 contacts the agency Program Manager indicating she needs to speak with\nher.\n Program Manager schedules a phone meeting with Staff 1 for 1/12/22 at which\ntime Staff 1 resigns.\nMonday 1/10/22\n During a house meeting with the youth, it comes up that Staff 1 will not be\ncoming back to work. Youth A allegedly makes a statement in front of his peers\nthat Staff 1 shouldn’t be there anyway and makes a statement about her having\ntouched him and trying to touch his penis.\nTuesday 1/11\n One of Youth A’s peers tells a staff member about Youth A’s allegations.\nWednesday 1/12\n A staff member tells Supervisor 1 about the allegations after which Supervisor 1\nmakes a DHHS report.\n Program Manager holds her already scheduled call with Staff 1 who makes a\nvariety of allegations against Youth A including:\n- suspected cocaine use\n- theft of other youth’s meds to use and/or sell\n- being drunk daily in the home.\nProgram Trainer – On 2/15/2022 I interviewed Program Trainer along with DHHS\nWorker by phone. Program Trainer reported she is responsible for training the home\nstaff and that she provided the training to Program Trainer. She stated she did not\nhave any information about the allegation but stated that if Staff 1 transported Youth\nA alone in her car she was in violation of protocol. She reported she did have\nconcerns with Staff 1 as an employee and there were “red flags” whenever she was\nworking because the youth wouldn’t talk to Program Trainer while Staff 1 was\nworking. Program Trainer would stop by the home to check in to see if Staff 1, as a\nnew staff, was following protocol. Staff 1 would seem nervous. Program Trainer\nstated once when she showed up Staff 1 told the youth to quickly pick up something\nthat was broken. Program Trainer stated she noticed Staff 1 would be upstairs\ndrawing while the youth were downstairs. Program Trainer stated the youth told her\nthat they were not comfortable with Staff 1, especially Youth A, but Program Trainer\ndid not know why. Program Trainer stated Youth A asked her if Staff 1 had\ncompleted a background check. Program Trainer told Youth A that he could reach\nout to her anytime and Youth A stated that he didn’t feel comfortable doing so.\n8",
    "Program Trainer stated the staff members are to complete a daily report for each\nyouth in the home and Staff 1 never reported Youth A drinking or being drunk.\nProgram Trainer stated if Staff 1 was aware of Youth A using or being under the\ninfluence of any substance and didn’t inform anyone, she was violating protocol.\nProgram Supervisor – On 3/15/2022 I interviewed Program Supervisor along with\nDHHS Worker via a virtual conference. Program Supervisor denied minimizing\nyouth’s use of tobacco and alcohol to Staff 1 during her interview. She reported she\ndid talk to Staff 1 about youth experimenting with cigarettes, vapes, marijuana, etc.\nand talked about the struggles they have had with police not taking these concerns\nseriously when they are contacted due to the substances being legal, even if the\nyouth are underage. She stated that she talked to Staff 1 about utilizing programs to\nhelp youth stay away from their use triggers. She states she talked about an incident\nwhen staff had to safety plan for a youth who was using heroine but did not express\nthat this was allowed.\nProgram Supervisor reported she was present when Supervisor 1 spoke to Staff 1\nabout Youth A’s substance use issues. Program Supervisor was also present when\nProgram Trainer talked with Staff 1 about Youth A’s substance use concerns and\nwhat staff were supposed to watch for regarding possible relapse.\nStaff 2 - On 2/15/2022 I interviewed Staff 2 by phone along with DHHS Worker. Staff\n2 was asked about the inappropriate touch allegation. Staff 2 stated that she can’t\nrecall the specific date, but Youth B talked to her about Staff 1 stating “she’s not\nworking here anymore?” When Staff 2 confirmed that she was not, Youth B seemed\nrelieved. Youth B told Staff 2 that Youth A had told him about Staff 1 trying to grab\nYouth A’s penis on 12/31/2021 while in Staff 1’s car. Staff 2 stated that she only saw\nStaff 1 and Youth A together on the Monday Staff 1 called the police on Youth A.\nDuring that shift, Staff 1 had pepper spray around her neck and said that Youth B\nwas afraid of Youth A. Youth A came into the house, stood near the kitchen and\nasked to talk to Staff 1 who then went downstairs with Youth A. After Staff 1 left work\nthat day, she texted Staff 2 and told Staff 2 to text her when she left work. It was\nafter Staff 2 texted Staff 1 that she left the house after her shift ended that Staff 1\ncalled the police. Staff 2 stated that she didn’t know why the police were called. Staff\n2 stated, the next day, Staff 1 called her and said Youth A was suicidal and “saying\ncrazy things.”\nStaff 2 was asked about Staff 1 as an employee and about the drinking allegations\nand she stated that she assumes Staff 1 was having inappropriate and\nunprofessional conversation with the youth because Staff 1 would talk to Staff 2\nabout things that concerned her such as her and her boyfriend’s mental health\nissues. Staff 2 stated that she had minimal interaction with Staff 1 because they\nworked different shifts, but Staff 2 told her Youth A told Staff 1 he was using alcohol.\nStaff 2 stated that she never observed Youth A drinking or drunk in the home, but\nthird shift staff found him intoxicated that he was throwing up in the home on\n12/31/2021. Staff 2 stated that she didn’t know where Youth A got the alcohol.\n9",
    "Staff 2 reported she recently left her position with the agency because Youth A was\nthreatening her after she caught him with cigarettes on Thanksgiving. Staff 2 stated\nYouth A tried to pay her off to not tell anyone about the cigarettes. She stated he\nsaid he wanted her dead and wanted to “pop the heads off” the third shift staff. She\nstated he would pace around the home, yelling, talking to the cameras, and his body\nlanguage and the look in his eyes made her feel as if he was plotting her death. She\nstated he was always rude and acted angry unless Supervisor 1 was in the home.\nStaff 2 reported Supervisor 1 always sticks up for Youth A and when Staff 2 sent\nSupervisor 1 emails or talked to her about Youth A’s behavior, Supervisor 1 would\n“pass it off as words.”\nStaff 3 - On 3/8/2022 I interviewed Staff 3 by phone along with DHHS Worker. Staff\n3 reported that he hasn’t heard anything about Youth A and Staff 1. He stated Staff 1\nwas always following the rules and was “serious” about her job. He stated that he\ndidn’t have concerns with her physical boundaries, but Youth A and another youth\ntold him that Staff 1 talked with them about her personal life issues.\nStaff 3 reported he caught Youth A with alcohol an 12/31/2021 and Youth A was\nintoxicated. He stated that it seemed like Youth A had made his own alcohol\nbecause there was a cup in the bathroom with an orange drink and hand sanitizer\nwas next to it. Staff 3 stated Youth A had consumed 4 “Locos” and possibly the\norange drink on that night. Youth A vomited and helped Staff 3 clean up his room\nthat night. Staff 3 stated he talked this through with Youth A that night and he\nseemed ok, so he reported it at the end of his shift which was the next morning. Staff\n3 reported a couple of weeks later he found alcohol in the bathroom and a mixed\ndrink on the table. Staff 3 stated he checked on Youth A, who was asleep, and he\nseemed fine, so Staff 3 took pictures of the alcohol and sent them to Supervisor 1.\nStaff 3 stated Youth A told him that he gets alcohol from a guy at the corner gas\nstation. Staff 3 reported the protocol for staff if a youth has alcohol or is intoxicate is\nto report it to Supervisor 1. Staff 3 said the staff are also to take pictures and send\nthem to Supervisor 1, which Staff 3 did via email and text. Staff 3 stated Youth A has\nnever consumed alcohol in front of him, but he did ask Staff 3 to not tell when Staff 3\nfound the alcohol. Staff 3 reported it to his superiors “because that’s my job.” He\nreported Youth A became angry at Staff 3 for reporting him. Staff 3 stated Staff 1\ntold him that Youth A was making verbal threats and Staff 1 was scared. Staff 3\nstated he has heard Youth A make verbal threats before when he was angry, and he\nwas aware that Youth A had made a verbal threat against Staff 3 regarding this\nincident but didn’t know the police were called by Staff 1 or that Youth A went to the\nhospital. Staff 3 stated Youth A has anger issues he needs to work on.\nStaff 3 reported after the first drinking incident, they had a staff meeting during which\nSupervisor 1 asked if anyone had any issues with Youth A. Staff 1 responded “a lot.”\nStaff 3 stated he agreed with Staff 1’s statement. Staff 3 stated Supervisor 1\ndownplayed the concerns then dismissed them entirely. Staff 3 stated Staff 1 felt\nunheard and said she was going to talk to someone higher up. Staff 3 stated he\n10",
    "thinks Supervisor 1 takes the concerns with Youth A seriously, but she downplays\nsome of it because she sees Youth A’s potential.\nStaff 3 stated when staff brought up the drinking concerns to Supervisor 1 after the\nsecond incident Staff 3 described, she said she would contact Youth A’s probation\nofficer. After that, Youth A’s services were increased. Staff 3 also stated staff are\nnow to do increased walkthroughs of the home to check on Youth A and that the\nstaff meetings have been increased from every two weeks to every week.\nYouth B - On 3/1/2022 I interviewed Youth B by phone while DHHS Worker was\nwith him in person. Youth B reported when he first moved into the home, Staff 1 was\n“good, helpful.” He stated after time she started to talk about her time in “mental\nhospitals” and other personal issues such as her past drug problems. Youth B stated\nhe didn’t want to talk about anything happening between Staff 1 and Youth A, but he\nagreed that a statement was made to him about something happening with Staff 1\nand Youth A on 12/31/21. The only thing Youth B would state was, after he and\nsome other youth returned from a trip to the mall on 12/31/2021 Youth A told Youth\nB that Youth A got Staff 1 to take him to Family Fare to get food. Youth B stated that\nYouth A told him that while Staff 1 was in the car with Youth A, Staff 1 was reaching\nfor him. Youth B did not want to provide any other detail, stating Youth A asked him\nnot to tell anyone. Youth B stated that after this incident Staff 1 only worked one\nother shift.\nYouth B stated that the night the police came for Youth A, Youth B woke up in the\nmiddle of the night to the sound of ambulances. He reported he heard this was\nbecause Staff 1 accused Youth A of using crack. Youth B stated he and Youth A are\nclose and talk a lot and Youth A has never talked about crack. Youth B was asked\nabout Youth A’s alcohol use in the home to which Youth A responded, “no\ncomment.” Youth B did state Youth B had never smoked or consumed alcohol with\nStaff 1 and never saw Staff 1 drink nor did he smell alcohol on her. Youth B stated\nthat he has never been afraid of Youth A and the two of them joke around a lot.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n Staff 1’s training transcripts documenting she participated in 11 hours of training\nwhich included, program orientation, de-escalation techniques, compliance and\nethics, mandatory reporting of abuse & neglect, safety training, and review of the\nsafety guidelines handbook.\n Program staff training plan outlining the required training, all of which was\ndocumented to have been completed by Staff 1.\n Employee orientation checklist which includes reviewing site specific “Security\nand Emergency Handbook” as well as “crisis and emergency situations” and\n“behavior management and house rules.” This form documented that Staff 1 was\ntrained on each of these on 12/1/2021; however, did not have Staff 1’s signature\n11",
    "despite the form stating that the employee and supervisor must sign prior to\nassuming full work responsibilities.\n Acknowledgment of handbook receipt electronically signed by Staff 1 on\n11/18/201.\n Staff notes covering December 24, 2021, through February 20, 2022, in which\nnone of the incidents of alcohol use, aggressive/concerning behavior, or police\ncontact were documented.\n Rent Agreement & House Rules for the program which states that substance abuse\nand smoking are not allowed on property.\n DHHS Worker’s report dated 3/24/2022 indicating that the individual was deemed\nunsuitable.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\n12",
    "ANALYSIS: Staff 1 denied making any inappropriate sexual advances\ntoward Youth A and there is not enough evidence to support the\nallegation. Staff 1 reported witnessing Youth A use alcohol and\ntobacco in the home on multiple occasions, which she did not\nreport to her co-workers or superiors. Staff 1 admitted to\ntransporting Youth A to a store and smoking with him while\nlistening to music in the car. Staff 1 reported suspecting Youth A\nof having cocaine and on at least one occasion, being ill from\ndrinking, but neither confirming these suspicions nor reporting\nthem to co-workers or superiors. Staff 1 admitted to talking to\nyouth in the home about issues in her personal life. Staff 1\ndemonstrated emotional instability during her interviews. Staff 1\nwas deemed unsuitable to work with youth.\nConsultation: Consultation is being provided regarding\ncommunication in the home as staff members reported they\naren’t always aware of all of the situations that occur with youth\nand their feelings that Supervisor 1 does not always take their\nconcerns seriously. Additionally, the staff notes provided did not\ninclude any of the incidents reported during staff interviews,\nwhich would have assisted in staff awareness of these incidents.\nTechnical Assistance: Staff 1 did not sign to verify completion\nof her orientation as required prior to assumption of job duties\nper a statement on the form. Staff 1 disputes receipt of the\ntraining. There should be a system of checks and balances to\nensure that all forms are completed and signed per the form\nrequirements.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend no change to the license status upon receipt of an acceptable\ncorrective action plan.\nApril 14, 2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\n13",
