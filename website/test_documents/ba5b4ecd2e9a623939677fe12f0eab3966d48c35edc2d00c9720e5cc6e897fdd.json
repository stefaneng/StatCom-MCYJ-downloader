PM was advised of the\ninvestigation.\nDHHS\nOn 6/7/22 contact occurred with the assigned DHHS worker. DHHS reported an\ninvestigation would be opened to determine if abuse occurred with any minors in the\nindependent living placement home. However, as Youth A was 18 years old, the\ninvestigation would not focus on her. DHHS worker reported speaking with a\nsupervisor at the agency, who stated Staff 1 admitted to the contact with Youth A,\nhowever he portrayed the incident as consensual. DHHS worker stated Staff 1 had\nresigned his position with the agency and an unannounced visit would be attempted\nat Staff 1’s home to complete an interview. DHHS reported Law Enforcement (LE)\nhad already completed their report and a copy would be provided to DCWL.\nYouth A\nOn 6/9/22 DHHS conducted an in-person interview of Youth A, with DCWL on the\nphone. An in-person interview was later conducted by DCWL on 6/14/22. Youth A\nreported moving to the home in March 2022. Youth A described the incident as\nreported in the allegation. Youth A clarified the inappropriate conversation initiated\nby Staff 1 included asking her about her dating habits, sexual activity, and becoming\n“friends with benefits”. Youth A reported Staff 1 forced her to perform oral sex on him\nfor approximately five minutes. Youth A stated there were no witnesses as everyone\nelse was downstairs when it happened.

    "Staff 1\nOn 6/9/22 DHHS conducted an unannounced in-person interview of Staff 1. An in-\nperson interview was later conducted by DCWL on 6/29/22. In both interviews, Staff\n1 reported engaging in sexual activity with Youth A. Staff 1 stated he knew he should\nnot talk with Youth A about sexual things or engage in this behavior. However, Youth\nA was very persistent and kept talking with him about her sexual preferences. This\nconversation went on for about a week prior to the actual contact. On 6/4/22 Staff 1\narrived at the house and found Youth A upstairs in the living room. The other youth\nin the home were downstairs at the time. Staff 1 reported Youth A tried to sit on his\nlap, but he moved away from her. Youth A then sat next to Staff 1 and asked him to\nengage in sexual activity with her. Staff 1 told her no. Staff 1 stated Youth A said she\nwould not tell anyone if he just let her do it. Staff 1 refused again. Youth A then\nstated she would report that he assaulted her, if he did not comply with what she\nwanted. Staff 1 was worried about losing his job, his status as a college student, and\nhis immigration status if Youth A made an assault allegation against him. Staff 1\nthen allowed Youth A to perform oral sex on him. Staff 1 reported this was the first\nand only time this happened. When asked about any other relationships at his other\nemployment, Staff 1 reported he previously dated a co-worker at another job. But\nthat person made a false police report about Staff 1 stalking her. Staff 1 was\narrested, but later cleared of the charges as he could show evidence they had been\ndating for several months and the allegation was untrue. Staff 1 stated that prior\nincident is what made him fearful of Youth A making an allegation if he did not do\nwhat she wanted. When asked why he did not try to stay away from her and notify\nhis supervisor, Staff 1 indicated he did not think anyone would believe him.\nProgram Manager\nOn 6/14/22 an interview was conducted on-site with PM. PM reported being on call, ,\nwhen the allegation was first reported. Youth A stated the incident occurred on\n6/4/22, but she did not report it to staff until 6/5/22. CA and Law Enforcement (LE)\nwere contacted. Due to Youth A being 18 years old, the agency was unsure if the\nallegation should be reported to DHHS-Children’s Services. LE went to the ILP\nhome on 6/5/22 to interview Youth A. LE told the agency not to complete any\ninterviews with youth or staff. On 6/6/22 the agency notified DHHS/DCWL of the\nallegation. The agency’s safety plan placed Staff 1 on leave pending investigation.\nStaff 1 later submitted his resignation on 6/7/22. In addition, caseworkers and life\nskills coaches increased their presence at the ILP house, in the event any youth\nneeded support.\nDocuments reviewed\n On 6/6/22 a review of Youth A’s case file was completed in MiSACWIS. No\ninformation relevant to this investigation was found.\n On 6/8/22 the police report was received by DCWL. The report indicated Staff\n1 denied any sexual or physical contact with Youth A. Staff 1 declined\nconsent for a DNA elimination test. No arrest warrant issued.\n4",
    " On 6/14/22 the agency’s Employee Handbook was reviewed. Pages 10-11\nidentified the expectation of staff to treat youth with dignity and respect, in an\nenvironment free from unwelcome conduct (verbal, physical, sexual, etc.)\n On 6/14/22 Staff 1’s employee file was reviewed. Staff 1 was hired in\nDecember 2021 and completed all training as required. Staff 1 signed an\nacknowledgement of training regarding policies and procedures on 1/19/22\nand acknowledgement of employee handbook on 12/12/21. A criminal record\nhistory search in the file showed an 8/31/21 charge of misdemeanor stalking.\nThis was accompanied by documentation dismissing the charges on 1/21/22.\nStaff 1’s first employee performance review on 6/4/22 was marked “expected\nperformance”. There was no disciplinary action noted in the file.\n On 6/30/22 a conference call occurred with DHHS. DHHS reported no\nfindings regarding the minor youth at the ILP home and Staff 1. DHHS\nprovided a copy of their written report on 7/8/22.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\ncontact with children or parents to be a person who has the\nability, experience, education, and training to perform the duties\nassigned.\nANALYSIS: Although there was conflicting information about whether it was\nconsensual or forced, a violation was found as it was determined\nStaff 1 and Youth A engaged in sexual contact.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\n_________________07/12/2022____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 13, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
