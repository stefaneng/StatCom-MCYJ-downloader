    "On November 29, 2021, a special investigation was initiated into the allegations\ndescribed above. Staff and youth were interviewed. A tour of the facility was\nconducted twice. Various documents were reviewed. What follows is information\nobtained from the aforementioned sources.\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that youth are locked in their rooms after shower time until the next\nmorning.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn December 3, 2021, Staff 1, the agency Program Manager was informed on site\nof the complaint and that an investigation had been initiated.\nThe complainant in this case is anonymous and therefore specifics about the\nallegations were not obtained.\nOn December 3, 2021, and January 11, 2022, Staff 1 was interviewed. Staff 1 is a\nworking out of class program manager. Staff 1 reported that staffing shortages have\nbeen problematic for the agency since summer 2021. Staff 1 informed me of the\nevening schedule for youth which begins with youth taking showers at 6pm daily.\nOne youth at a time is allowed to take a shower while the rest of the youth are\nlocked in their rooms. Staff 1 reported that once showers begin not more than one\nyouth at a time are allowed outside of their rooms except to take a shower or to\nreceive medication. When showers are concluded youth who take medications\nreceive them at 7:30pm. Staff 1 reported that at 8:00 pm youth are secured in their\nrooms for the evening until morning wake up at 8:00am. Staff 1 reported that prior to\nstaffing shortages youth who were doing well and had obtained a “transition status”\ncould be out of their rooms until 9:00pm, Sunday through Thursday, and until\n9:30pm on Friday and Saturday nights. Staff 1 reported that this could be\naccommodated when there was a 2:00pm to 10:00pm shift staff which, until recently,\ndid not exist for several months due to the staffing shortages. Staff 1 reported that at\n8:00pm night staff arrive and work a 12 hour shift, until 8:00am the next morning.\nStaff 1 reported that during the shift the night staff is responsible for supervision and\nroom checks of 2 pods, thus he/she cannot allow transition level youth out of their\nrooms due to the inability to supervise the youth as well as conduct room checks.\nStaff 1 reported that new staff are being hired which will resolve the staffing shortage\nproblem.\nOn January 11, 2022, Youth A was interviewed. Youth A is a 16 year old male.\nYouth A reported that showers begin at 6:00pm, then medication time is after\nshowers. Youth A reported that medications are given to youth one at a time while\nother youth are in their rooms. Youth A reported that showers are taken one at a\ntime while the rest of the youth are in their rooms. Youth A reported that at 8:00pm is\nbedtime.\n3",
    "On January 11, 2022, Youth B was interviewed. Youth B is 16 year old male. Youth\nB reported the same schedule as reported by Youth A. Youth B reported that when\nthere were fewer youth on the pod, after showers youth could be out in the milieu\nafter shower time but that hasn’t happened very often since the program is short\nstaffed.\nOn January 11, 2022, Youth C was interviewed. Youth C is a 15 year old female.\nYouth C reported the same schedule as Youth A but added that sometimes\nrecreation would occur after dinner and before shower time when they had sufficient\nstaffing.\nOn January 11, 2022, Youth D was interviewed. Youth D is an 18 year old female.\nYouth D reported that showers begin at 6:00pm and medications are passed at\n7:30pm. Youth D reported that showers are taken one at a time with the other youth\nsecured in their rooms. Youth D reported that after showers youth cannot come out\nof their rooms until 8:45am the next morning. Youth A reported that there is not\nenough staff to allow for youth to have time in the milieu after showers. Youth D\nreported that before there was staffing problems youth who were doing well in the\nprogram could stay up in the milieu until 9:00 or 9:30pm but this has not occurred for\nseveral months when the program became short staffed.\nOn January 14, 2022, the WOC Director was interviewed. The Director\nacknowledged that that during the staffing shortage there were times when youth\nwould be in their rooms from shower time at 6:00pm to 8:00am the next morning.\nThe Director reported that a youth could attend a therapy visit in the evening or\ncomplete a chore in the pod. The Director also acknowledged that transition youth\nwere not able to stay up in the milieu past 8:00pm due to staffing shortages. The\nDirector reported that additional staff have been hired and this weekend transition\nyouth will once again be allowed “late nights”. The Director reported that due to now\nbeing at full staffing all youth will be allowed down time in the milieu before bedtime.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4161 Seclusion rooms; policies and procedures.\nAn institution approved to use a seclusion room shall\nestablish and follow written policies and procedures\nspecifying its use. The policy shall include, at a minimum, all\nof the following provisions:\n(b) The room may only be used if a resident is in danger of\njeopardizing the safety and security of himself, herself, or\nothers.\nANALYSIS: The Program Manager and Youths A, B, C and D all stated that\ndue to staffing shortages there were times when youth were\nsecluded in their rooms from the 6:00pm shower time until the\nnext morning at 8:00am, except to take a shower or receive\nmedication. The Director acknowledged the same, adding\noccasionally a youth would also come out of their room for a\nchoir or therapy. Staffing shortages is not an allowable reason\nfor the use of seclusion.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that agency staff are not conducting daytime room checks for youth\nexperiencing mental health problems.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the interview with Staff 1 he reported that room checks on youth confined to\ntheir bedroom for potential self-harm or behavioral issue are being checked by staff\non a variable basis not to exceed 15 minutes. Staff 1 reported that the room checks\nare documented on a “room confinement log”. Staff 1 reported that supervisors\nreview room check logs for compliance. Staff 1 submitted room check logs for my\nreview.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nBay Pines Center Room Confinement Log: The complaint did not specify when or\nfor what youth room checks were not being completed therefore a sample of the logs\nfor October 2021, November 2021, and December 2021, were reviewed. The logs\ndocument that room checks were occurring as required by the rule.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-to-\nresident ratio formula for direct care workers.\n4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the\ndirect supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable\ninterval, eye-on checks of residents. The time between the\nvariable interval checks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 reported and documentation confirmed room checks\nroom checks were occurring according to the rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that changes in meal menus are not updated and posted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn December 3, 2021, Staff 2 was interviewed. Staff reported that she was the cook\nand still helps out in the kitchen occasionally. Staff 2 reports that since the advent of\nCOVID menus are changed frequently as Gordon Food Services does not always\nhave the requested food items and so substitutions occur frequently. Staff 2 reported\nthat she knew that changes to the menu need to be reflected on the menu. Staff 2\nreported that she uses post-its and sticks them on the menu to reflect changes.\nDuring the tour of the facility, I asked Staff 1 to show me where menus are posted.\nStaff 1 showed me where the menu is to be posted and there was no menu posted.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were asked where the menu was. Staff 1 and Staff 2 reported that\nthey did not know where the menu was or why one was not posted.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4149 Resident nutrition.\n(4) Menus, including snacks if provided, shall be written\nand posted prior to the serving of the meal. Any change or\nsubstitution shall be noted and considered as part of the\noriginal menu. Menus shall be retained for 1 year.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: There was not a menu posted in the area Staff 1 reported it\nshould be posted. Staff 1 and Staff 2 could not account for a\nmenu or why it was not posted.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that toilets in youth bedrooms are not always working.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn December 3, 2021, and December 15, 2021, I conducted unannounced visits to\nthe agency. A tour of the facility was conducted each time. During the December 3,\n2021, unannounced visit the functioning of the toilets of each unit pod was observed.\nThere were no concerns noted as toilets were flushing and in good operation. No\nconcerns were noted during the December 15, 2021, inspection.\nOn December 3, 2021, Staff 3, the facility maintenance person was interviewed.\nStaff 3 reported that sometimes a toilet will get plugged as youth sometimes will try\nto flush clothing or other items and the toilet will become plugged. Staff 3 reported\nthat a week prior to the interview a youth had flushed a towel and the toilet became\nplugged. Staff 3 reported that the youth was moved to another room for the night,\nand he unplugged the toilet the following day.\nDuring the December 3, 2021, interview with Staff 1 he reported that toilets will\noccasionally become plugged because youth will attempt to flush T-Shirts or other\nitems causing the toilet to become plugged. Staff 1 reported that when that happens\neach pod has a community toilet that can be used until maintenance unplugs the\nbedroom toilet.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4407 Facility and premises maintenance.\n(6) Plumbing fixtures and water and waste pipes shall be\nproperly installed and maintained in good working\ncondition.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: During the unannounced visits a sample of toilets in each pod\nwere flushed and all were operational. Staff 1 reported, as well\nas Staff 2, that sometimes a toilet will become plugged and\nmaintenance is required to unplug it. Staff 1 reported that all\nyouth have access to community toilets should a youth’s\nbedroom toilet become plugged.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that youth are not receiving therapy and the therapist encourages\nrelationships between male and female youth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring a phone interview with the Director on January 11, 2021, I requested\ndocumentation of therapy for a sample of 5 youth. The Director was asked if therapy\nis being provided for youth and he acknowledged that during a loss of staff in\nsummer 2021, and until Staff 4 was contracted to provide therapy beginning in\nNovember 2021, there was a lapse of therapeutic services. The Director reported\nthat one therapist was placed on administrative leave in September 2021 and\nanother therapist had left the agency in March 2021.\nOn January 11, 2021, Staff 4, a contracted therapist was interviewed via telephone.\nStaff 4 reported that she conducts therapy weekly with youth. Staff 4 reported that\nshe began providing the service beginning in November 2021.\nThe Director and Staff 4 were asked if they have encouraged relationships between\nyouth in the program. The complaint was vague in that it did not specify or define\nrelationships or identify youth. They denied that this has occurred.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW: Therapy notes were reviewed for 5 youth. Documentation of\ntherapy for Youth D indicates that therapy services were not provided for Youth D\nfrom March 4, 2021, through October 17, 2021. Documentation of therapy for Youth\nC indicates that therapy services were not provided for Youth C from September 29,\n2021, to November 24, 2021. There was no documentation of therapy for Youth F\nwho was placed on June 17, 2021. Youth E and Youth G entered the program in\nDecember 2021 and therapy services were provided weekly.\n8",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nJRM 302 Individual or Group Therapy\nAt least two times per week, direct therapeutic\ninterventions must be provided for each youth individually\nand/or in group sessions. At least one session per week\nmust be an individual therapy session. Individual and/or\ngroup therapy must be provided in accordance with the\nyouth's treatment needs as identified in the youth's\ntreatment plan.\nANALYSIS: The director acknowledged and documentation supports that\ntherapy was not provided to Youth C, Youth D, and Youth F for\nextended periods of time when the agency was short staffed or\nwithout therapists.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan the recommendation is for\ncontinuance of the regular license.\nJanuary 14, 2022\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 18, 2022\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n9"
