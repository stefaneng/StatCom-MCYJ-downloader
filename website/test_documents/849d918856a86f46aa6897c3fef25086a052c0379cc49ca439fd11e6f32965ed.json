INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4162 Seclusion Rooms; administrative oversight.\nSection (11) All seclusion will be prohibited effective November 1, 2022.\nDescription\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth is being secluded at facility in response to behavioral\nissues. Youth was isolated for 1.5 months and has been kept in a\npart of the facility that is not part of their program.\nInvestigation I interviewed Staff 1/complainant via telephone on 2/15/23 and\nconfirmed the information in the allegations.\nAn additional complaint came in on 2/21/23 regarding Youth A. I\ninterviewed Second Complainant/Former Staff 3 via telephone on\n2/22/23 and confirmed the information in the allegations. Second\nComplainant/Former Staff 3 reported similar concerns as\nComplainant/Staff 1 including Youth A being secluded, not having\naccess to clean clothing and not attending school. She also\nreported that Youth A is secluded unjustly due to her race and\nsize and that Youth A is not allowed access to her therapist when\nshe wants it.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/16/23 in\ncollaboration with the Government Worker. Youth A reported that\nshe does not feel safe at the facility as she has been secluded for\nover a month in the emergency intake wing and has been unable\nto participate in programming, school, or groups. Youth A reported\nshe has trouble getting clean clothes and towels and often has to\nwait for staff to go and get these items for her. Youth A reported\nshe has a bedroom, bathroom, sensory room and outdoor area in\nthe emergency intake wing. Youth A reported she is being\ndiscriminated against as she is the only Juvenile Justice youth at\nthe facility. Youth A reported she had an incident where she\nflipped two tables and on 1/11/23 she was separated from the\nother youth since that time. Youth A reported other youth in the\nprogram flip over tables but do not get separated from everyone\nelse. Youth A reported the psychiatrist and therapist decide who\n2",
    "gets secluded and the length. Youth A reported she is separated\nbecause she does not take her medication. Youth A then reported\nseveral issues with how her medication is prescribed and how she\nisn't going to take it all day long. Youth A reported she feels\nforced to take her medication and has no say in what is\nprescribed. Youth A then reported she takes her medication as\nprescribed now and is still separated. Youth A then stated she\nrefused her medication the last two days because she didn't like\nthe staff member who was dispensing it. Youth A reported she\nand her therapist don't sit down and talk about her situation.\nYouth A reported that she and her therapist \"do not see eye to\neye\". Youth A reported her therapist brings another staff member\nwith her to the sessions and she does not like that. Youth A\ndenied she and her therapist have ever had any incidents or\nproblems.\nThe Therapist was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/16/23 in collaboration with the Government Worker and the\nRights Officer. The Therapist reported that she attempts to meet\nwith Youth A between 3 and 4 times a week. Youth A tells her\nshe does not want therapy and Youth A has never requested to\nsee her. The Therapist reported that Youth A refuses to\nparticipate in her medication reviews with the psychiatrist and if\nshe does attend the review Youth A refuses to talk to the\npsychiatrist. The therapist reported that Youth A receives all\nprograms while in the emergency intake wing (Dreams, Journey to\nSuccess, virtual school and therapy). The services are brought to\nher in the emergency wing. The therapist reported she has tried\nseveral ways to engage with Youth A via talk therapy, worksheets\nand journaling. The therapist reported that she is part of the team\nthat meets weekly and determines the placement of Youth A. The\nreason for her current placement is due to her refusal to take her\nmedication, her refusal to participate in her medication reviews,\nher quick volatile aggression and the need to keep Youth A, staff\nand other youth safe. The therapist reported the psychiatrist is\ntrying to stabilize Youth A so that she can interact appropriately\nwith others. The therapist recommends placement of Youth A in\nthe emergency wing at this time for the safety of staff and youth.\nThe therapist reported Youth A has threatened to kill her and to kill\nher son who is 2.5 years old. There was an incident when Youth A\nran at the Therapist with her hands out trying to hit her when\nYouth A was upset about court. The Therapist does not interact\nwith Youth A alone due to her verbal and physical aggression\ntowards her.\n3",
    "I interviewed the Director of Integrated Behavioral Health at the\nfacility on 2/16/22 in collaboration with the Government Worker.\nShe reported they have an integrated behavior health meeting\nweekly that includes Youth A's therapist, psychiatrist, DHHS staff,\nprobation officer and the journey to success team. Youth A's plan\nand placement is reviewed and determined at this meeting each\nweek. She described this meeting as a proactive meeting. The\nDirector reported that Youth A has been placed in the emergency\nwing since 1/11/23 after an incident that involved Youth A being\nphysically and verbally aggressive and flipping tables that required\nthe police to be called to gain control of the situation. Youth A had\nhad several incidents of physical and verbal aggression prior to\nthis incident, and it was determined for the safety of other youth\nand staff she be placed in the emergency wing for an alternative\nprogramming location. The Director reported Youth A receives\nthe same programming as the other youth and she does not miss\nout on any of her services. The Director indicated Youth A\nreceives therapy services but typically refuses them. She\nreceives psychiatric services that she refuses to attend or\nparticipate in. She receives virtual schooling and the journey to\nsuccess program. The Director reported Youth A has made it\nknown that she is just riding out her stay at the facility and doesn't\nneed this place or the services. Youth A will be 18 in May and\nplans to be discharged at that time. The Director reported they are\nalways looking at reintegrating Youth A each week based on her\nbehaviors. The facility feels it is important to work towards\nintegration as they do not want to release her to the community\nwithout integration.\nThe Rights Officer was interviewed on 2/16/23 face to face in\ncollaboration with the Government Worker. He reported that\nYouth A is on a 2:1 specialized plan based on her psychiatrist and\ntherapists' recommendation. The Rights Officer reported that\nYouth A does leave the building and campus to go to doctor\nappointments, dental appointments and has left for a psychiatric\nevaluation. He reported Youth A has multiple delinquency and\nassault charges for fighting. Youth A has a history of multiple\nverbal and physical aggression while at the facility. The Rights\nOfficer reported that Youth A is not very compliant with her\nmedication often refusing to take it. He sees Youth A three times\na week as he is the PREA representative at the facility. He sees\nYouth A and asks if she is having any issues. He reported she\nhas not filed or expressed any complaints in 2023. The Rights\nOfficer reported he did receive a grievance in 2022 from Youth A\nthat said \"I hate my fucking therapist\". The Rights Officer reported\nthe therapist will not meet with Youth A alone as she has\n4",
    "threatened to kill her. The Rights Officer reported Youth A told\nanother resident she was going to \"ring her therapist's neck\".\nThe Rights Officer reported that Youth A is court ordered to take\nher medication and has not been compliant. She refused her\nmedication the past two days and when reviewing her compliance\nin December she refused her medication 27 times. The Rights\nOfficer reported Youth A is not the only Juvenile Justice child in\nthe program at the facility.\nA tour of the intake wing occurred on 2/16/23. The space has a\nseparate bedroom, full bathroom with shower, a separate sensory\nroom and a hallway which has a table that can be used as a desk.\nThere is also a fenced in outdoor space with picnic tables that\nYouth A has access to use.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\nYouth A' treatment plan was reviewed, and she is receiving the\nservices in her treatment plan in the emergency wing.\nIncident report dated 1/10/23 authored by Therapist-Youth A told\nanother youth she was going to go over to her therapist’s office to\nkill her while making a strangulation gesture with her hands and a\npretend rope. The client said Youth A acted out how she would\nkill her therapist by pretending she had a rope in her hand, and\nshe would sneak up behind her chair and strangle her with a rope.\nIncident reports were reviewed involving Youth A from 11/11/22\nthrough 2/15/23. There were 21 incident reports that detailed\nextremely violent physical and verbal aggression, threats of harm,\nfighting with youth and staff, screaming, throwing furniture,\npunching youth and staff multiple times, and destroying property\n(holes in walls, tearing phone out of the wall, dumping salt all over\nthe living area, flipping the table with her laptop on it, flooding the\nwing by placing towels, blankets and books in the toilet multiple\ntimes. Youth A was taken to the hospital by police due to\nextreme physical and verbal aggression on 12/14/22, 1/11/23,\n1/11/23 (twice that day) and 1/30/23.\nYouth A’s medication logs from February 2023 were reviewed.\nYouth A has refused to take one of her psychotropic medications\n12 times and the other psychotropic medication 14 times.\nThe reintegration plan was reviewed. Youth A's plan for\nreintegration began on 3/1/23. Youth A will go back into the milieu\nwith a 2:1 staffing ratio on 3/1/23.\n5",
    "The facilities Behavior Management Policy was reviewed. The\nfacility does not use seclusion which is described as preventing a\nclient's egress from a designated area. The facility utilizes\nsegregation for safety which is used to regain control or to de-\nescalate a crisis situation. It is not intended to last for prolonged\nperiods of time.\nPA 116 definition of seclusion is the involuntary placement of a\nminor child in a room alone, where the minor child is prevented\nfrom exiting by any means, including the physical presence of a\nstaff person if the sole purpose of that staff person's presence is to\nprevent the minor child from exiting the room. Seclusion does not\ninclude the use of a sleeping room during regular sleeping hours\nto ensure security precaution appropriate to the condition and\ncircumstances of a minor child placed in the child caring institution\nas a result of an order of the family division of circuit court under\nsection 2(a) and (b) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939,\n1939PA 288 MCL 712A.2 if the minor child's individual case\ntreatment plan indicates that the security precautions would be in\nthe minor child's best interest.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews and review of documentation there is no\nevidence that supports Youth A is being secluded. Youth A is\nplaced in a separate wing from other youth for the safety of herself\nand others. She has access to the wing which includes a\nbedroom, full bathroom, sensory room, desk/table/computer, and\noutdoor space. She is receiving all services outlined in her\ntreatment plan in this wing and has two staff with her. Her\nplacement in the wing is evaluated weekly and has been\ndetermined necessary by her psychiatrist and therapist due to\nphysical and verbal aggression and her noncompliance with taking\nher medication.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4125 Personal possessions; money; clothing;\nSection storage space.\nDescription (1) A licensee shall have a written policy that designates all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) The method for ensuring that each resident has sufficient\nclean, properly fitting, seasonal clothing.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A does not have clean clothes.\nInvestigation Youth A, Complainant/Staff 1, and Complainant/Former Staff 3\nreported Youth A does not have clean clothing and Youth A\ncannot leave the area to wash her clothing. Complainant Staff 1\n6",
    "reported she brought Youth A clothing and washed her clothing.\nYouth A reported getting her clean clothing can take time each\nday and sometimes she doesn't get her clothing until mid-morning.\nYouth A reported she does not have clean towels as needed.\nI interviewed the Director of Integrated Behavioral Health on\n2/16/23 at the facility in collaboration with the Government\nWorker. She reported there is a washer and dryer right outside\nYouth A's living space, and it is utilized to wash her clothing. She\nreported staff wash Youth A's clothing, and it is provided to her\ndaily. The director reported there is also a cabinet full of towels in\nthe space that Youth A resides.\nI interviewed Team Leader 1 at the facility on 2/16/23. He has\nbeen employed as a Team Leader for three years. He reported\nthat Youth A has clean clothes and towels available to her daily.\nHe reported dirty towels are placed in a bag and removed weekly\nand replaced with clean towels. He reported Youth A has flooded\nthe area she resides in between 4-5 times by placing all of her\navailable towels and bedding in the toilet and shower drains.\nTeam Leader 1 reported there is never an issue with having clean\nclothes or towels for Youth A.\nWhen I interviewed Youth A she had on clean clothing. There\nwere clean towels observed in her bathroom.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews there is no evidence that supports Youth A\ndoes not have clean towels or that she has to wait to get clean\nclothing each day. In this case, Youth A only reported that it took\nlonger (mid-morning) some days for her to get her clean clothes,\nand not that she did not have clean clothes.\nCONSULTATION:\nIt is recommended that the facility log or otherwise track when\nyouth are provided clean clothes/towels.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4123 Education\nSection (2) Provision shall be made for an appropriate education program\nDescription in accordance with 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1853.

Youth A reported the psychiatrist had to write a letter\nto give permission for Youth A to have a computer.\nDirector A was interviewed on 2/16/23 at the facility in\ncollaboration with the Government Worker and the agency Rights\nOfficer. The Director reported that Youth A is in virtual school,\nand it did take some time to get her into virtual school due to\nconcerns with permission for Youth A to have a laptop. The\npsychiatrist had to write a letter verifying she would be safe with\nthe laptop and not destroy it. Youth A has been in virtual school\nsince the permission was granted approximately 3 weeks.\nThe Rights Officer reported on 3/1/23 that an Educational\nSpecialist was working with Youth A in the wing while they were\nworking out the waiver/paperwork for her computer. Youth A was\nalso provided with worksheets to keep her on track with her\nclasses.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews there is no evidence to support Youth A\nwas not attending school. Youth A reported she had been in\nvirtual school for three weeks and there was a two-week period\nthat she was not in virtual school due to needing a computer.\nDuring that time Youth A was provided with worksheets,\nschoolwork and an educational specialist worked with her to\nensure she was receiving educational services.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to\nSection requirements; staff qualifications.\nDescription (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation A staff member has spoken inappropriately to youth regarding\nsexuality.\nInvestigation During the course of this investigation, Youth A reported she does\nnot feel comfortable with Staff 2 as he has made inappropriate\nsexual statements to her. Youth A reported Staff 2 asked her and\na staff member if they have ever had a gay moment, and he asked\nanother staff and Youth A if they thought another staff member\nwas gay. Youth A also said Staff 2 commented \"he is kinda cute\"\nwhen Youth A was talking about another staff member. Youth A\nreported she has told all the supervisors that she is not\n8",
    "comfortable with Staff 2 and he was in her wing working 2-3\nweeks ago.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 2/28/23 in collaboration with\nthe Government Worker. He reported he has been employed as a\nYouth Counselor at the facility since November 2022. Staff 2\nreported he has not worked with Youth A in approximately 3\nweeks as Youth A made a poster of him with derogatory\nstatements on it. She also was being aggressive with him during\nthe shift indicating she did not want him working in her wing and\nthat she was going to beat him up. Staff 2 reported a separation\nplan was made after that incident and he no longer works with\nYouth A. Staff 2 was unsure if the plan was put in writing, and he\ncould not remember the name of the staff person who the plan\nwas done with. Staff 2 indicated that at times he has \"adult\"\nconversations while working when away from the youth and he\nthinks Youth A overheard him. Staff 2 reported he did ask another\nstaff member if they ever had a gay moment. Staff 2 denied\nasking Youth A this question. Staff 2 reported he did comment\n\"he is kind of cute\" when Youth A was talking about a staff\nmember. Staff 2 denied that he asked Youth A or another staff if\nthey thought a particular staff member was gay.\nThe Rights Officer reported that Staff 2 requested he not work with\nYouth A due to derogatory comments she made to him. Staff 2 no\nlonger works in the emergency wing. A copy of the separation\nplan was requested, and the Rights Officer reported this was not\ncompleted in a written format. The Rights Officer reported that\nYouth A was using homophobic slurs and derogatory statements\nabout Staff 2 and the plan for separation was put in place around\n2/9/23.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nIncident report dated 1/19/23 in the intake wing authored by Team\nLeader 1. Staff 2 entered the intake wing and Youth A began to\nyell and scream about Staff 2 being present on the wing. Staff 2\ndid not say anything in response. Youth A then cursed and said\n\"Y'all keep bringing these bitches back here and I do not like him \"\nand \"I do not want him on my wing\". Staff 2 left, and they\ndiscovered he had gone to the wrong wing and did not return to\nthe intake wing.\nI reviewed the employee behavior policy-employees are expected\nto demonstrate behavior that exhibits respectful and professional\nboundaries at all times.\n9",
    "Analysis Based upon interviews there is no evidence that supports Staff 2\nmade inappropriate sexual comments to Youth A. He did report\nhe had an adult conversation with a coworker that Youth A\noverheard, and he commented on a coworker's looks. Staff 2\nreported he did not ask Youth A about another staff member’s\nsexuality.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nStaff 2 admitted to having an adult conversation with a coworker\nthat was overheard by Youth A and that he commented on a\ncoworker's looks. These are not appropriate conversations for\nyouth to be hearing and should not occur when working directly\nwith youth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4151 Emergency; continuity of operation\nSection procedures.\nDescription\n(1) A child caring institution must establish and follow written\nemergency procedures that have been approved by the\ndepartment that maintain the continuity of operations for a\nminimum of 72 hours to ensure the safety of youth for the following\ncircumstances:\n(c) Medical emergencies.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A's unit was not cleaned after Covid was in the building.\nInvestigation The complainant reported that Youth A’s wing was not cleaned\nafter they had Covid-19 in the building.\nYouth A reported two staff in the building were Covid positive and\nhad contact with her in her wing.

She reported she handles all reports\nof Covid with staff and youth, does contract tracing, and\ndetermines if cleaning of an area is needed. The Director\nreported no staff in Youth A's wing had Covid. There was no\nreason to have Youth A's wing cleaned/sprayed.\nTeam Leader 1 reported he had no knowledge of Covid exposure\nin Youth A's wing or a need for the area to be sprayed or cleaned.\n10",
    "Document reviewed:\nCovid 19 Category 3 level cleaning. The policy states that when\nCovid has been in a wing or area of the facility, a category 3 level\ncleaning will occur.\nAnalysis Based on interviews there is no evidence to support Youth A was\nexposed to Covid or that her wing needed to be cleaned/sprayed\nfor Covid. The facility appears to have followed their emergency\nprocedure.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection Rule 109. (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care, safety,\nand supervision, methods for addressing residents needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A is not receiving therapy.\nInvestigation During the course of the original investigation, Youth A reported\nthat she does not sit down with her therapist to talk about her\nsituation.
