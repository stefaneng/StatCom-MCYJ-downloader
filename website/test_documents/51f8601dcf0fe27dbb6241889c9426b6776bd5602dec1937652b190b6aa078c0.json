Compliance\n01/31/2022 Pre-Exit Conference\nALLEGATION:\nDuring a restraint, staff cut clothing off youth and put a blanket over youth due to\nyouth's refusal to get into a safety gown.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews:\nAdministrator was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on January 4, 2022.\nAdministrator said the facility has a policy and procedure for removing youth’s\nclothing when necessary. Administrator said Youth A has a lengthy history of\nsuicidal ideation and self-harm and the night in question was having suicidal actions.\nAdministrator said Supervisor called him and told him what had been occurring\nthroughout the evening and the current status of Youth A. Administrator said he\ngave Supervisor permission to remove Youth A clothing and give her a safety gown\nand safety blanket. Administrator said all paperwork was completed to document this\nincident. Administrator said this was not the first time they needed to remove Youth\nA’s clothing due to her suicidal actions.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on January 4, 2022. Youth A\nsaid she has been placed at Bay Pines for about seven months and has had her\nclothing cut off her body four times. Youth A said each time this has occurred the\nstaff working has asked her to change and she refuses. Youth A said staff will give\n2",
    "her several chances and about thirty minutes before removing her clothing. Youth A\nsaid she is not allowed to keep anything on under the safety gown. Youth A said\nboth male and female staff will remove her clothing and it is always more than one\nperson in the room. Youth A said while removing her clothing they will have her\ncovered with a safety blanket and move it as they remove the clothing to keep her\nfully covered. Youth A said the staff will then leave the room one at a time until\neveryone is gone, and she then puts the safety gown on. Youth A said the removal\nof her clothing triggers her as she was raped as a child. Youth A said staff will do\nadditional checks on her once she is placed in her safety gown. Youth A said it is not\ncommon that it occurs and there is always a supervisor there when it has happened.\nYouth A said she sees her therapist once per week but sometimes wishes she could\nhave additional therapy.\nSupervisor was interviewed via TEAMS on January 10, 2022, and via telephone\non January 28, 2022. Supervisor said the night of 12/11/2021, Youth A had ripped\nher shirt and underwear into long strips and had them hidden in her vagina.\nSupervisor said Youth A was in her room and removed them and tied the strips of\nclothing around her neck approximately six times. Supervisor said staff on the unit\nhad gone into Youth A’s room and cut the clothing off from around her neck.\nSupervisor said Youth A was then asked to change into a safety gown and she\nrefused. Supervisor said Youth A was given about fifteen minutes and several\nprompts to change however refused. Supervisor said she contacted Administrator\nand he gave approval to cut off Youth A’s clothing and provide her with a safety\ngown. Supervisor said she went into Youth A’s room and asked her once again to\nchange and she refused. Supervisor said she asked Youth A to move to another\nroom due to staff being unsure if Youth A had anything else hidden in her room to\nself-harm with, however Youth A refused to move. Supervisor said Staff 1 entered\nthe room and put Youth A into a restraint hold and began to escort Youth A to the\nnew room. Supervisor said Youth A picked up her feet, so Staff 1 carried Youth A\ninto the new room. Supervisor said Staff 1 fell on top of Youth A and had his knee on\nYouth A’s back and Supervisor directed Staff 1 to move immediately. Supervisor\nsaid Youth A was face down on the floor and staff held her in this position while she\nremoved Youth A’s clothing. Supervisor said Youth A was covered with a safety\nblanket while the clothing was removed so Youth A was not exposed. Supervisor\nsaid Youth A was given a safety gown and all staff left her room so she could get up\nand put on the gown. Supervisor said it is rare to have to remove youth’s clothing\nhowever Youth A has been a difficult case with her self-harm and suicide attempts\nand so they have done it more often with Youth A. Supervisor said the procedure is\nto attempt to have the youth change themselves and if they do not and continue to\nbe a risk supervisors would contact Administrator to obtain permission to remove the\nclothing. Supervisor said the process for removing the clothing was completed per\npolicy.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face via TEAMS on January 31, 2022. Staff 1\nsaid he has worked at Bay Pines since 8/23/2021. Staff 1 said he does not\nremember all the details to the incident on 12/11/2021. Staff 1 said he was not in the\n3",
    "room when they removed Youth A’s clothing as he has never witnessed that before.\nStaff 1 said he is aware that the decision to remove a youth’s clothing is done by a\nsupervisor. Staff 1 said it typically is with female youth so he would be in the unit\nroom while it is occurring in the bedroom, and he has helped hold a blanket up over\nthe doorway for privacy for a youth but never actually been in the room during the\nremoval of clothing.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via TEAMS on January 10, 2022. Staff 2 said she has\nworked at Bay Pines for about six months. Staff 2 said Youth A has daily issues of\nself-harm. Staff 2 said Youth A will rip her clothing into long strips and then tie the\nstrips around her neck. Staff 2 said Youth A is usually very obvious with her self-\nharm and will yell for staff. Staff 2 said staff will have to enter Youth A’s room to\nremove the strips from her neck at which time Youth A usually becomes very\ncombative. Staff 2 said when Youth A is self-harming excessively or doing\nsomething that is deemed more dangerous, she is asked to change into a safety\ngown. Staff 2 said staff usually will give Youth A between fifteen minutes and one\nhour to change her clothing. Staff 2 said several times Youth A has refused to\nchange her clothing and has had her clothing cut off and been given the safety gown\nto put on. Staff 2 said all of the other youth are placed in their rooms and their\n“blockers” are put down on their door window so they cannot see out of their rooms.\nStaff 2 said a safety blanket is always placed over top of Youth A so she is never\nexposed, and females will be the ones to remove Youth A’s clothing. Staff 2 said\nthere are times when male staff will have to hold Youth A’s legs however, they are\nalways facing away and never doing the cutting of the clothing. Staff 2 said when\nYouth A is self-harming a supervisor is called to the unit to assist and then the\nsupervisor is the one to give the directive to the staff if they are allowed to remove\nthe clothing or not. Staff 2 said direct staff never make the decision to remove the\nyouth’s clothing.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face via TEAMS on January 13, 2022. Staff 3\nsaid he was working on Youth A’s unit on 12/11/2021. Staff 3 said Youth A has\ncycles of behaviors which can be days at a time.

Staff 3 said Youth A\nmade a “dummy” in her bed and then laid next to her door, so Staff 3 called Staff 2\nto assist in doing a room check. Staff 3 said Staff 2 did a check in Youth A’s room\nand Youth A had her face covered with a blanket and had labored breathing. Staff 3\nsaid additional help was called and Staff 2 and Staff 3 went into Youth A’s room and\nStaff 3 said he secured Youth A in a seated restraint and Staff 2 cut the fabric from\naround Youth A’s neck. Staff 3 said he and Staff 2 then left the room only to notice a\nfew moments later Youth A had tied something else around her neck. Staff 3 said he\nand Staff 2 went back into the room and removed the fabric again. Staff 3 said it was\nthen decided Youth A needed to move to a different room due to staff not being sure\nif Youth A had anything else hidden in her room. Staff 3 said no one allowed Youth A\nto change on her own and it was decided to remove her clothing which was\ncompleted by Supervisor and Staff 2. Staff 3 said it is his understanding that in order\n4",

The\nincident report is consistent with staff interviews regarding Youth A’s self-\nharm and removal of her clothing. The incident report did not describe Youth\nA being carried from one room to another but rather “escorted”. The incident\nreport did report Staff 1 and Youth A falling into the room however did not\nreport Youth A being in the prone position while the staff removed her\nclothing.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance with Resident restraint. In\ninterviews with Supervisor, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5 as well as\nvideo review it is determined Staff 1 carried Youth A which is not\nan approved escort or hold. In addition, Youth A was in the\nprone position for a period of time when her clothing was\nremoved which is not a safe or approved position.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2021C0102011 dated 3/10/2021 CAP approved 3/31/2021\nIV.
