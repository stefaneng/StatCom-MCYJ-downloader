    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nTitle qualifications\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Former Youth J told Complainant female Staff 1 wrestled with him.\nInvestigation Documents reviewed:\nDCWL received this complaint on 3/7/24.\nI reviewed MISACWIS on 3/7/24 which was not updated and\nindicated Youth J never resided at Wolverine Center. Intake\ninformation indicates Former Youth J has borderline cognitive\nfunctioning.\nInterviews:\nI contacted Complainant/Youth J’s PAFC Worker on 3/7/24 via\nphone, left a voice message and did not receive a response.\nI interviewed Staff 1 via Teams on 3/11/24. She has worked at\nthe facility for six months. Staff 1 recalled working with Former\nYouth J at Wolverine Center when he required 2:1 staffing (two\nstaff assigned to one youth). She described him as tall,\ncognitively impaired, hot-headed, out-of-control, and aggressive\ntoward other youths. When Youth J was downgraded to 1:1\nstaffing, Staff 1 said the youth kept asking that she be his\nassigned 1:1 staff. “I did it once or twice then refused. I’m small. I\ncan’t hold him back. He called me ‘mom’ and I told him not to call\nme that. He would touch my shoulder and move into my personal\nspace.” Staff 1 said when Former Youth J would get into her\npersonal space, she would redirect him not to touch her and\nasked him to stand 3-feet away. “Sometimes he would listen and\nsometimes not…Another reason why I did not want to be assigned\nto him was because he was acting like he wanted me to be his\ngirlfriend.” Staff 1 denied ever wrestling with Former Youth J.\nShe said she decided it was best to set firm boundaries with him,\nwhich she did.\n2",
    "I interviewed Staff 2 on 4/11/24 via phone. He has worked at the\nfacility for six months. Staff 2 recalled seeing Staff 1 supervising\nYouth J. “I never saw her horseplaying, wrestling or anything with\nhim.” Staff 2 described Staff 1 as someone who is “firm and\nknows how to verbally de-escalate youth.” Staff 2 recalled he\nonce overheard Youth J refer to Staff 1 as “auntie.” “Staff 1 told\nhim, ‘My name is Staff 1. Youth can’t call me auntie.’” Asked to\ndescribe Former Youth J, Staff 2 said he had poor boundaries and\nwanted to be friends with all of the staff. “He called me ‘bro’ and I\ntold him to call me Staff 2.”\nFormer Youth J was interviewed by Consultant 2 and Area\nManager at his current placement on 4/18/24. He stated Staff 1 at\nWolverine Center is like his mom. Former Youth J stated he\nnever fought or wrestled with Staff 1.\nAnalysis There is no evidence of inappropriate boundaries or behavior on\nthe part of Staff 1 related to Former Youth J.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Discharge plan\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4166\nSection (2) For an unplanned discharge, an institution shall provide a brief\nDescription summary or other documentation of the circumstances\nsurrounding the discharge.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Facility did not send Former Youth J’s medication with him when\nhe was arrested by police on 2/25/24.\nInvestigation Documents reviewed:\nFor an unplanned discharge, Rule 400.4166 does not require an\ninstitution to send his medication with him during a police arrest or\nto deliver a youth’s medication or belongings to his next\nplacement.\nWolverine does not have a policy indicating medications and\nbelongings are to be sent with the youth or police at the time of an\narrest or unplanned discharge.\n3",
    "I reviewed the Foster Care/Juvenile Justice Action Summary\ndated 3/5/24 which indicates Former Youth J was arrested by\npolice at Wolverine Center on Sunday 2/25/24, which is\nconsidered an unplanned discharge.\nI reviewed email correspondence dated 3/1/24 between\nComplainant/Youth J’s PAFC Worker and Wolverine Case\nManager. Complainant/Youth J’s PAFC Worker asked if any of\nFormer Youth J’s belongings needed to be picked up and\nWolverine Case Manager indicated his medication needed to be\npicked up.\nInterviews:\nConsultant 2 interviewed Youth J at the Wayne County Juvenile\nDetention Center on 3/7/24 and he told her he had not received\nhis medication.\nI contacted Complainant/Youth J’s PAFC Worker via phone on\n3/7/24, left a voice message and did not receive a response. A\nPCU call occurred on 3/14/24 during which Complainant/PAFC\nWorker stated she had not picked up Former Youth J’s medication\nyet and believed it was still at Wolverine Center. DHHS and\nDCWL personnel informed Complainant/PAFC Worker that it is\nher responsibility to go to Wolverine Center, pick up Youth J’s\nmedication and take it to his new placement as this was an\nunplanned discharge and he had already gone without his\nmedication for 18 days. Complainant/ PAFC Worker stated she\nwould pick up the medication sometime the following week.\nAnalysis Consistent with the discharge plan licensing rule, the facility\nprovided a brief summary of the circumstances surrounding\nFormer Youth J’s unplanned discharge from Wolverine Center on\n2/25/24 in a Foster Care Juvenile Justice Action summary dated\n3/5/24.\nIt was Complainant/PAFC Worker’s responsibility, not Wolverine’s,\nto pick up Former Youth J’s medication and deliver it to his next\nplacement.\nWolverine Center does not have a policy indicating medications\nand belongings are to be sent with the youth or police at the time\nof an arrest or unplanned discharge.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 1, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 25, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n5"
