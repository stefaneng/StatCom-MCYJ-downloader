    "summary": "A staff member at the Calumet Center juvenile facility struck a youth in the back of the head during a physical altercation on September 15, 2024. The incident began when the agitated youth ran inside, threatened the staff member, and swung at him, with reports indicating the youth struck the staff member first; the staff member admitted he overreacted and should have walked away. The investigation, which included interviews and video review, substantiated that the staff member hit the youth, constituting a violation of rules prohibiting physical punishment. Culpability lies primarily with Staff 1 for his retaliatory action, though the facility also bears responsibility as this was a repeat violation, indicating a failure to ensure compliance with behavior intervention policies.",
