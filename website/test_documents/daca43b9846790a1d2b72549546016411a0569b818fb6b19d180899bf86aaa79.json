During the special\nevaluation the two older of the children and the foster parent’s daughter\nconfirmed the foster mother spanked the children. The foster parent was\nfound in noncompliance with of the behavior management rule and household\nmaintenance rule with respect to allegations of a cluttered home. A corrective",
    "action plan was completed with the foster parent around both violations,\nwhich include that the foster parent was to complete trauma informed\nbehavior management training. The agency appeared to have acted\nappropriately related to this matter and it adhered to departmental timeframes\nand requirements related to the special evaluation.\n• The second incident related to an allegation that the foster mother spanked\nher four-year-old grandson (who was visiting her from his relative foster\nhome) with a shoe on his butt, because he urinated on himself. The agency’s\nspecial evaluation found the foster parent in violation of the behavior\nmanagement rule, after the foster parent and child confirmed physical\ndiscipline was used by the foster parent. A corrective action plan was\ncompleted with foster parent around proper forms of discipline. The agency\nadhered to departmental standards related to the special evaluation.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period:\nThe first corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024 Interim inspection\nwhere it received 18 rule violations.\nDuring this current inspection for the agency’s renewal license, the agency received\n24 rule violations. This was an increase from the last inspection. Of these 24\ncitations, 10 are repeat violations within the last two years (6 are specific repeats\nviolation from the last inspection). The agency’s CAP compliance around these 6\nrule violations is as follows: the number of individual cases cited remained the same\nwith respect to 5 of the rule violations cited; and the number of individual cases\ncited with respect to the other rule increased by 2.\nSupervision case notes, training documentation, file reviews; and worker interviews\nprovided proof of the agency implementing and working on its CAP. Various action\nsteps were completed and or implemented, but the agency was not totally\nsuccessful with all aspects of the CAP; as shown by the repeat violations.\nNotwithstanding the repeat citations, per this inspective review it showed the\nagency had positive gains; various training/discussions were completed for\nemployees on the CAP, and there were no missed caregiver/foster parent home\nvisits, or sibling visits.\nThe second corrective action plan related to Special Investigation\n2024SIC0001442, related to a complaint received on 5/17/2024. It was alleged the\nagency failed to report injuries on a child for two weeks. The special investigation\nfound the agency in violation of rule R400.12214 Compliance to the child protection\nlaw. An acceptable corrective action plan was submitted, that indicated the staff",
    "would be trained on the child protection law; compliance would be monitored during\nchild welfare meetings; and training would occur with new staff during onboarding.\nThe corrective action plan was approved on 7/26/2024. The agency has\nimplemented this corrective action plan, and they are in compliance with it.\nThe third corrective action plan related to Special Investigation 2024SIC0001680,\nrelated to a complaint received on 8/13/2024. It was alleged youths in Independent\nLiving are confined to their rooms, cannot get out once the door is closed, no fire\nextinguishers, there is limited staff, and the windows do not open. The special\ninvestigation found that the windows were not able to be open in the event of an\nemergency. The agency submitted an acceptable correct plan which was approved\non 11/15/2024. The corrective action plan indicated the agency would obtain\nquotes from vendors and select a vendor for new window installations. The agency\nhas made progress related to quotes, and window purchasing. The windows’\ndelivery was expected later in the week of 1/6/2025, with the windows anticipated to\nbe installed within the next month.\nThe agency has implemented this corrective action plan and are executing it.\nThe agency has three other special investigations where actions are pending:\nSpecial investigation 2025SIC000065 related to a complaint received on\n10/29/2024, that included an allegation that the youth was supposed to have\nstaples removed from their head within five days and staff did not comply with this\neven though they were aware of the recommendation. Additional allegations were\nthat a youth was prescribed medication for various diagnoses and there had been\nmultiple occasions where his medication was delayed by a day or more.\nThe agency was found in violation of R400.12507 for Medical, dental and mental\nhealth care after the special investigation determined the agency failed to follow-up\nto have the youth’s staples removed as the doctor recommended. It was also\nrevealed the agency was locking up the youth’s medication, had taken charge of\nstorage/administration of the youth’s medication; and the youth had missed some of\nhis medication due to two of his medications running out.\nAdditionally, the agency was found in violation of R400.12504(1) for Eligibility\nrequirements; which centered on a lack of appropriate documentation of the youths’\nrationale for independent living placement in the program; and R400.12509(3)(o)\nIndependent living record due to the special investigation revealing there were late\nservice plans.\nThe special investigation report was recently provided to the agency.

The\ncompletion of this special investigation is pending.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s report dated 1/8/2025. The chief\nadministrator reported staff retention and turnover continued to be a challenge in\n2024, and many workers left the agency due to pursuing other social work\nopportunities outside of the child welfare field or left for more competitive salaries\nor work/life balances. Other challenges identified related to changes in supervisors\nand case workers struggling with timely data entries, MISACWIS uploads and\nreport submission. Likewise, the chief administrator’s report indicated the agency\ncontinued to experience some difficulties complying with rules R400.12405;\nR400.12413; R40012419 and R400.12509. The chief administrator reported not\nwithstanding those struggles they continue to work to improve in those areas. She\nreported they have seen an increase in compliance with their contract related to\nadoption, foster care, borrowed bed paper work and overall independent living\ndocumentation. She also reported meeting and trainings with staff have been\nhelpful; and that they review social work contacts and the Book of Business\nweekly during supervision with workers and supervisors.\nThe agency plans to continue their efforts to increase compliances overall and are\nhopeful related to staff retention.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted an annual budget for 2025; and an independent financial\naudit for the year end 12/31/2023. A review of these documents did not reveal an\narea of concern.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, the director of foster care\nservices at the entrance conference, and both of these staff along with three\nsupervisors at the exit conference, two foster care workers, a licensing worker and\na foster care/adoption worker were interviewed.

Area of growth needed\nincluded improved communication about changes the come up, with clarity being",
    "offered; and greater organization around getting staff into systems that affects how\nthey do their work and get paid.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nNo safety issue or concerns were revealed during my site visit. The agency has\nspace and equipment for its staff and stores files securely.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts this reporting period.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
