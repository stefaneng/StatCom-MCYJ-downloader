Staff sprayed youth with a fire\nextinguisher to get the youth to leave the cubicle. The youth's skin\nwas burning, and he had to vomit as a result. Youth went outside\nto vomit and staff would not let the youth return so youth left and\nreturned 30 minutes later. Staff still refused to allow youth back\ninto the facility. Youth slept at a gas station and attempted to\nreturn the next day, but staff would not allow it. Youth went to the\npolice station and was brought back to the facility by law\nenforcement on 6/24/24. Staff threatened to have another youth\nassault this youth. Youth went AWOL again and was transported\nback by law enforcement on 6/25/24. Staff would not let the youth\nback into the facility, so youth went to the police department.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 06/26/2024 an email was sent to Foster Care Worker (FCW)\nadvising of allegations involving Youth A.\nOn 06/26/2024 a voicemail message was left for Complainant\nrequesting a return call if there were any additional concerns.\nOn 06/26/2024 a telephone call was held with DHHS Specialist.\nShe advised of conversation with Complainant. She stated the\ncomplainant confirmed the allegations as accurately reported.\nShe recalled that Youth A did appear to have some discoloration\nto his arm but was unsure if it was from the child being outside or\nbeing sprayed. She also advised that Complainant stated that\nYouth A seemed like he was afraid to return to Wolverine due to\nbeing threatened by some staff.\nOn 06/26/2024 a joint interview of Youth A was completed along\nwith DHHS Specialist 2 via telephone. Youth A and DHHS\nSpecialist 2 were located at the Clinton County DHHS office in St.\n2",
    "Johns, MI. Youth A advised that he was arguing with Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 at Wolverine a few days ago. He stated he ran into the\ncubicle because he was being chased by six residents that were\nmad with him because he was fighting with Staff 2. He stated the\noffice is normally unlocked and stated on this day the medical cart\nwas also unlocked but denied that he touched anything. He\nreported that Staff 1 came into the office and told him to come out\nor she was going to spray him with the fire extinguisher. About 5\nto 10 seconds later he reported that she sprayed the extinguisher\nat the wall over his head. He stated he then grabbed an\nextinguisher that happened to be in the cubicle and sprayed it\nback but aimed it into the air and accidentally sprayed himself. He\nthen reported he was sprayed directly in the face with the\nextinguisher by Staff 1. He was adamant that he did not spray\nfirst. He also advised that there are no cameras in the office area.\nYouth A reported he then ran outside because he was choking,\nand his skin was burning from the fire extinguisher. He threw up\nand then tried to reenter the building, but Staff 1 and Staff 2\nrefused to let him back in and said they were never going to let\nhim back in again. He reported he left Wolverine, went to the gas\nstation on Jefferson and pumped gas for money and then took the\nbus to Belle Isle. He reported he hung out there and went\nswimming in the river and around 9 or 10 pm that same day he\nwalked back to Wolverine (which he said took him two hours) and\nknocked on the door, but no one answered. He reported he then\nwalked to the Citgo and stayed there until morning. The gas\nstation closed at 2 or 3 am and he just sat outside until daytime.\nIn the morning, he reported he walked to the 5th precinct and told\nan officer what had happened, but the officer made him mad and\nhe left and went back to the Citgo gas station and stayed there\nuntil the next day. He reported that he again returned to\nWolverine and they allowed him back into the facility. He recalled\nthat he remained for the day, but when he went outside later that\nday for about 30 minutes, they refused to let him back in. Youth A\ndenied that there were any other youth outside at the time. He\nreported Staff 1 and Staff 2 then threatened to have a resident\n“whoop his ass” so he took off again and went back to the Citgo\ngas station. While he was at the gas station, he reported that an\nunknown man and woman asked if he was ok or needed a ride\nand drove him to the 10th precinct. An officer from the precinct\ndrove him back to Wolverine but was told that he was no longer a\nclient at the facility. The police took him back to the station and\ncontacted DHHS. Youth A stated he purchased food while he was\nAWOL from money he earned while pumping gas for people at the\ngas station. He denied that he went to anyone’s home in the\n3",
    "community while he was AWOL.

She was\nadvised of allegations. She provided copies of the incident reports\ninvolving Youth A from the facility. The Chief Administrator\nadvised that the allegations were incorrect. She recalled that\nYouth A actually sprayed the staff with the extinguisher, and it\noccurred on 6/22/2024 and not on 06/22/2023. She confirmed\nthat the incident occurred in the office space and that there are no\ncameras in that area. Chief Administrator reports Youth A was\ngone for over 24 hours before she closed his bed. He was gone\nfrom 10 am on 6/24 to 3:30 pm on 6/25. She advised that the\npolicy allows for closure of the bed of youth in the shelter program\nif they are AWOL for more than 24 hours. She stated at no point\ndid staff refuse to allow Youth A back into the facility if he had\nbeen gone for less than 24 hours or had been seen within the 24-\nhour time frame. She also confirmed that when youth return to the\nfacility from AWOL status they are allowed to enter the building,\nbut are housed in the atrium or conference room area in the very\nfront of the building. Youth are searched in this area and\nassessed for the need of medical treatment.
