She reported waking up late last week and\nmissing breakfast, so she made some toast, and staff told her to\nhurry because she needs to be on time for school.

However, Youth C reported that Youth C is\nbeing held against Youth C’s will. Youth C reported not liking\nYouth B because Youth B is autistic and Youth B makes the\nprogram unsafe. Youth C also reported feeling safe overall in the\nprogram. Youth C reported staff are “good overall” but don’t aways\nenforce the consequences the same for each youth (unable to\nprovide a specific example).\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face with MDHHS Worker at\nthe facility on 6/9/2025. Youth B reported sometimes staff are not\nnice but was unable to provide specific examples of not being nice\nother than arguments at times.

MDHHS\nWorker approved the safety plan.\n4",
    "Wedgwood Christian Services Riebel rules and Expectations\nGeneral house rules without a date. This document outlines the\nrules for the unit where Youth A is lodged. Rule number 12 states\nyouth are not allowed in the staff office. The level system is\noutlined on this document and daily point sheets are used to\nmeasure youth’s success and areas in need of improvement. The\nfacility will use a calculated weekly number for each youth and\nchanges to the youth’s level will occur on Thursdays. There are\nsix levels outlined with the Orientation level at the beginning. It is\ndocumented that youth can move up to the next level after the\norientation level by building trust with staff and their therapist,\navoiding peer negativity, not engaging in AWOL, and no negative\ntalk or suspicious behavior. Level 1 can last for 1 week but the\ntime on this level is determined by the youth’s therapist and staff.\nA youth can be placed on level 1 for unsafe, aggressive, violent,\nor sexually inappropriate behaviors. Other reasons are\ndocumented as including AWOL, hurting someone or threatening\naggression, sexual boundary violations, breaking something on\npurpose, and significantly unsafe contraband. A youth can move\nto level 2 or be removed from level 1 after an assessment by their\ntherapist and staff and found to be safe. Level 2 is documented as\nthe youth needing more work on processing basic house and\nprogram expectations. To move to the next level, it is documented\nthat youth must accept feedback and redirection from staff, show\neducational effort, positive participation in all activities such as\ngroup, therapy, programming, show improvement in handling\nfrustration and anger, following routines such as chores and\nbedroom cleaning, and maintaining a positive attitude while\navoiding negative peer interaction. Level 3 is documented as the\nyouth is doing well in general and following rules and\nprogramming expectations on a consistent basis. Youth are also\nexpected to model program values with a weekly point average of\nat least 2.8. It is documented youth must display the ability to\nfollow staff’s direction, be invested in schooling, display positive\nleadership, use proper coping skills, complete daily routines\nsuccessfully, display appropriate communication, demonstrate\nknowledge and value for programming, and maintain level 3 for\nfour weeks consecutively. Youth are also expected to write an\nessay explaining why they are ready to move to level 4. Level 4 is\nfor youth that are excelling in the program and consistently\nshowing investment in treatment. They will demonstrate positive\nleadership abilities and attitude. They need very little redirection\nfrom staff and hold peers accountable in a positive consistent\nmanner. The last level is the transition level in which the youth are\njust about ready to be discharged from this program into a less\n5",
    "secure program. In the section titled “Jobs/Chores general\nhousekeeping” it is documented that if a youth fails to complete\ntheir room and/or job, they may not use privileges that day which\nincluded they are not allowed to go off grounds or have free time\noutside.\nHR file for Supervisor 1 was reviewed. Documentation indicates\nSupervisor 1 was hired on 8/8/04 and the documented disciplinary\naction in the file is dated 1/31/23. This action involves a “growth\nplan” for lack of staff competency, effective communication, and\ntraining. Supervisor 1 is also up to date on required trainings.\nHR file for Supervisor 3 was reviewed. Documentation indicates\nSupervisor 3 was hired on 1/17/22 and the disciplinary action\ndocumented in the file involves a “growth plan dated 2/13/23” for\nlack of staff competency, effective communication, and training.\nSupervisor 3 is also up to date on her required trainings.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as evidenced by interviews with\nstaff, and youth and documents reviewed. Evidence does not\nsupport the allegations that Youth A is being mistreated and\nhaving privileges removed. Youth A seems to present with\nstruggles with relationships and processing Youth A’s own\nemotions and perceptions of the environment.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & R 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection Rule 158. (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow\nDescription written policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a youth\non any part of their body.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff members and other residents are threatening Youth A and\nphysically abusing her. On 6/2/25, Supervisor 3 smacked Youth A\non her right hand. This resulted in a red mark for a few hours.\nThere is no red mark today. A couple weeks ago, Supervisor 1\nkicked Youth A in her leg. There is still a bruise today from being\nkicked. She is threatened by both staff and other residents. Youth\nA feels unsafe due to physical abuse from other residents and\nstaff members.\n6",
