Under Staff 1’s supervision, Youth A reported she removed\nthe couch cushions off the couch and brought her blankets and\nher mattress into the living room along with Youth B, Youth C, and\nYouth D. Youth A reported Staff 1 gave them permission to bring\nthe items out of their rooms. Youth A reported she placed her\nmattress on the floor, but not next to Youth B.

The Scheduling Manager and Unit\nManager share responsibility for maintaining these ratios. If a\nbuilding falls out of ratio, corrective measures such as\nimplementing stay-over shifts, borrowing staff from other units,\nutilizing contingent staff, or approving overtime may be used. The\nrequired staff-to-client ratios are as follows: 1:9 during school\nhours, 1:3 during non-school hours, and 1:4 during sleeping\nhours.\nBehavior Management Policy:\n5",
    "Behavior management interventions at Vista Maria are only used\nwhen a client poses a danger to themselves or others. These\ninterventions are considered a last resort and should only be\nimplemented after less restrictive methods—such as verbal de-\nescalation and therapeutic interventions—have been attempted\nwithout success. Staff are required to receive ongoing training and\ndemonstrate competency in non-physical intervention techniques,\nincluding verbal de-escalation, conflict mediation, active listening,\nand observational methods aimed at preventing emergency safety\nsituations.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo Footage of 8/22/25, Beata Hall Wing A and was\nreviewed on 9/5/25. The video began with Youth A, Youth B,\nYouth C, and Youth D sitting in the living area. Youth A and Youth\nB were seated in separate chairs in front of Staff 1, while Youth C\nand Youth D sat on a couch to the left of Staff 1. Youth C and\nYouth A were the first to get up and began grabbing pillows from\nthe living room couch. Youth B walked off camera but returned\nholding a pillow and blanket.\nShortly after, all the youth joined together and began building a\nfort using the living room pillows.

    "assure the continual safety, protection, and direct care and\nsupervision of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance.\nType\nAllegations Staff 2 reported she could have done more to separate Youth A\nand Youth B by standing in between them but was unable to sit\nwith the girls in front of their rooms, because there were not\nenough staff on the wing. Staff 4 reported her shift being difficult to\nsupervise due to being out of the required staff-to-client ratio,\nsupervising four youth—three of whom were on observation—\nwhile policy mandated a 3:1 ratio.\nInterviews:\nYouth A, Youth B, and Youth C were interviewed face to face\non 8/27/25.\nYouth A reported Staff 4 redirected all the Youth to go back to\ntheir room, but she and Youth B decided to sit outside their rooms\nin the hallway. Youth A admitted to sitting on the floor with her\ncovers but denied that she and Youth B touched each other\ninappropriately. Youth A reported Staff 4 was supervising her and\nYouth B in the hallway until Supervisor 1 told her to put the covers\naway.\nYouth B reported she and the other Youth brought their bedding\nout into the living area. Youth B reported Staff 1 was present to\nsupervise her and the other youth until Staff 4 took over. Youth B\ndenied that there was any other coverage in Wing A.

Staff 4\nreported after Youth C and Youth D put their bedding away, Youth\n8",
    "A and Youth B refused to enter their rooms and remained seated\noutside each of their rooms on the floor. Staff 4 reported she\nobserved Youth A and Youth B sitting next to each other with their\nblankets. Staff 4 reported she attempted verbal de-escalation and\ntried to separate them, but they refused to separate and go into\ntheir rooms. Staff 4 reported both girls kept switching the lights on\nand off and continued to not listen to verbal directives. Staff 4\nreported she kept a clear line of sight on both youth until they\neventually went into their rooms. Staff 4 reported she could have\ndone more to separate the girls by standing in between them but\nwas unable to sit with the girls in front of their rooms, because\nthere were not enough staff on the wing. Staff 4 reported being the\nonly staff assigned to Wing A at this time. Staff 4 reported this shift\nbeing difficult to supervise due to being out of the required staff-to-\nclient ratio, supervising four youth—three of whom were on\nobservation—while policy mandated a 3:1 ratio.\nConsumers Rights Officer was interviewed face to face on\n10/7/2025 at Vista Maria. According to the Consumers Rights\nOfficer, after reviewing additional video footage, Staff 4 was not in\ncompliance with the required staff-to-client ratio. Consumers\nRights Officer confirmed Vista Maria’s policy mandates a 1:3\nclient-to-staff ratio. It was also noted that, because Youth A and\nYouth B were lying on the floor outside their rooms with covers\nover them, additional staff support should have been provided to\nassist Staff 4. Furthermore, it was reported that if no staff were\navailable, Staff 4 could have positioned herself in front of Youth A\nand Youth B to prevent potential physical contact between the\nyouth.\nDocumentation:\nStaff 4 personnel file: Staff 4 has a Discipline record but it's not\nrelative to this investigation. Staff 4 completed Aggression\nReplacement Therapy on 07/23/25, Safety Care training on\n6/27/25, and Motivational Interviewing on 6/05/25 and 6/20/25,\nand CPI -Nonviolent Physical Crisis Intervention Training on\n02/24/25 and 02/25/25.\nIncident Report #4110 dated 08/22/25 authored by Staff 4.\nIncident report is consistent with Staff 4 interview.\nVideo Review:\nVideo Footage 4 of 8/22/25 from 9:43pm until 10:03pm in Wing\nA. Staff 4 is observed standing at the end of the hallway with\nYouth A, Youth B, and Youth C. Youth D briefly exits her room but\nreturns shortly after. Youth C is seen standing at the end of the\nhallway, looking out the Wing A exit door, then returning to the\n9",
    "living room to sit in a chair. Staff 3 enters Wing A, appears to give\nYouth C a snack, then distributes snacks to the other youth before\nbeginning to clean. After eating, Youth C sits on the floor outside\nher room with Youth A and Youth B. Later, Staff 3 and Staff 4 are\nseen at the opposite end of Wing A. Staff 3 empties the trash cans\nand leaves the wing, Staff 4 continues straightening pillows in the\nliving room in an area that limits her visibility down the hallway due\nto a wall. Staff 4 sweeps and cleans until she eventually sits in a\nchair that provides a partial line of sight to Youth A and Youth B.\nShe begins working on paperwork until the video ends.\nVideo Footage 5 of 8/22/25 from 10:03pm until 10:50pm in\nWing A. Video begins with Staff 4 seated at the opposite end of\nthe hallway from Youth A and Youth B. Although her chair is\npositioned facing the youth, Staff 4 is observed with her head\ndown and focused on a clip board. Youth C exits her room and\nwalks to the end of the hallway. As she reaches the end, the lights\nin that area turn off, and Youth A and Youth B are no longer\nvisible. Staff 4 gets up, walks down the hallway, turns the lights\nback on, and returns to her chair. Youth A and Youth B remain on\nthe floor outside their room, covered with a white blanket. Staff 4\nremain seated until she gets up to conduct room checks. She\nbegins at the end of the hallway near the youth and proceeds to\ncheck each room as she moves back toward her chair. A few\nminutes later, Staff 4 walks down the hallway again, briefly pauses\nnear Youth A and Youth B, then returns to the living area and\nreads something on the wall. She resumes room checks until the\nvideo ends at 10:50:29.\nVideo Footage 6 of 8/22/25 from 10:50pm until 10:59pm in\nWing A. The video begins with Staff 4 walking through Wing A.\nYouth A and Youth B are seated at the opposite end of the\nhallway. Youth B gets up, gathers her blanket and pillow, places\nthem in her room, and then walks to the living room area to join\nStaff 4. Staff 4 follows her back to her room. Youth A remains on\nthe floor under a white cover. Supervisor 1 enters the wing and\nspeaks with Youth A until she gets up. At this point, all youth are\nin their respective rooms. Staff 4 continues cleaning as Supervisor\n1 exits the wing. She is seen sweeping, then picking up a\nclipboard and sitting down. Eventually, she gets up and walks\ntoward the opposite end of the hallway.\nAnalysis The agency was found in non-compliance with staff-to-client ratio\nrequirements based on staff interviews and video review. Although\nsupervision was present, video footage confirmed the agency\nfailed to maintain the required 1:3 staff-to-client ratio. Staff 4\nreported always maintaining line-of-sight supervision and\n10",
    "expressed uncertainty about whether physical contact occurred\nbetween Youth A and Youth B. However, video evidence shows\ninconsistent line-of-sight supervision. Staff 4 was observed\nmaking rounds down the hallway where Youth A and Youth B\nwere lying on the floor but did not remain positioned near them.\nInstead, she spent most of her time in the living room area,\nlocated at the opposite end of the hallway. At various points, she\nwas seen cleaning in areas that obstructed her view of the youth,\nlooking at her clipboard, and changing the television station. Staff\n4 acknowledged during the interview that she could have done\nmore to separate the girls by positioning herself between them but\nstated she was unable to sit outside their rooms due to insufficient\nstaffing on the wing. Youth A and Youth B were observed with\nbedding outside their rooms. However, due to camera angles, it\nwas unclear whether any physical contact occurred.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/13/2025\n______________________________________\nErica Marshall Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/15/2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n11"
