She explained that TDM's are not held for respites as\nit is a temporary placement change and not meant to be\npermanent. This is something that is offered to caregivers to help\nwith maintaining a placement.

She reported she did not discuss\nYouth A going to Foster Parent 1’s as a temporary respite\nplacement.

She reported she informed BM the\nallegations were not substantiated, and Foster Parent 1 had a\nsafety planned in place.\n7",
    "FCW admitted she should have shared the placement move with\nBM and moving forward she will do so. FCW explained at the time\nshe did not see the placement move affecting BM’s and her plan\nfor reunification. FCW reported the paperwork involved with\nrespites and replacements can be time consuming so that does\nnot leave much time for her to stop and think that she should\ninform BM of the respite placement. She said moving forward,\nshe will make sure she includes any change of placements with\nbirth parents.\nFCW reported that Youth A is currently placed with his Maternal\nGrandmother as requested by BM. Maternal Grandmother\nprevious allegations were not substantiated; therefore, this\nplacement is safe, appropriate, and BM was notified of the\nplacement change by the FCW and PM prior to the change.

    "Analysis Program Manager reported TDM's are not held for respites as it is\na temporary placement change and not meant to be permanent\nplacement change. Foster Care Worker stated she did not\ndiscuss Youth A going to Foster Parent 1’s as a temporary respite\nplacement. She reported she discussed the respite placement\n(Foster Parent 1) with Youth A. Although original placement was\nintended for respite, Youth A stayed with Foster Parent 1 for\nalmost two months and became a change of placement versus a\nrespite placement. FCW did not notify BM of the change in\nplacement.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12413\nSection Medical and dental care policy\nDescription • (1) An agency's medical and dental care policy must\ninclude all the following:\n• (b) The provision of emergency medical, surgical,\nand dental care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency is not maintaining appropriate communication with\nrespondent parent regarding child medical issues.\nInvestigation Biological mother (BM) was interviewed on 8/13/2025, via\ntelephone.

BM reported Foster Care Worker and Program Manager\ndid not inform her Youth B had a seizure and was taken to the\nhospital.

BM reported\nshe felt this was an inappropriate answer coming from\nprofessionals.\nBM reported Youth B has appointments to see his pediatric\nneurology specialist on 8/5/25, due to his brain bleed that\noccurred in February 2025. She reported Youth B missed this\nappointment and BM was not given a reason why the appointment\nwas missed. BM explained Youth B’s brain bleed was\nunexplained, and she had no idea how it occurred while he was in\nher care. She reported in a recent parenting time visit with Youth\n9",
    "A; he shared with her that he caused the brain bleed of Youth B.\nShe reported Youth A told her he got up in the middle of the night\nwhen everyone was sleeping, went into Youth B’s bedroom,\npicked him up and dropped him on the floor. Youth A told BM he\npicked Youth B up from the floor and placed him back in his crib.\nBM reported she was unaware of this because she never heard\nYouth B crying or noise coming from Youth B’s bedroom. BM\nreported she immediately informed FCW who was monitoring the\nparenting time visit. No additional information was reported\nregarding this incident.\nBM reported another appointment for Youth B’s neurologist was\nscheduled for 8/11/2025, and Youth B was very late for this\nappointment, but the neurologists did see him.\nFCW was interviewed 10/14/25, via telephone. She reported\nBM called the agency to discuss Youth B having a seizure before\nshe was able to inform BM. She reported Youth B has been\nplaced in the home of Foster Parent 2 since 5/1/2025. Foster\nParent 2 is fictive kin who BM is friends with. She reported Foster\nParent 2 shares information about everything that happens with\nYouth A or Youth B with BM before calling the agency. She said\nthe agency had a conversation with Foster Parent 2 regarding\nreporting information/incidents to the agency regarding\nplacements in her home prior to sharing with foster parents.\nFCW stated anytime there are any type of medical issues, BM is\ninformed as soon as they hear of a medical issue and\nappointments.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed via TEAMS on\n8/15/25. PM reported similar information as FCW, in that anytime\nthere is any type of medical issue, BM is informed as soon as\npossible when they hear of a medical issue and she is informed\non appointments.\nFoster Parent 2 (FP2) was interviewed on 8/25/25, via\ntelephone. She reported she has known BM for a long time.\nFoster Parent 2 reported Youth B was always sick and that she\nassumed a lot of his sickness came from attending day care. She\nreported he catches colds regularly. FP 2 reported Youth B had\nhand/foot/mouth disease, walking pneumonia, and seizures. She\nreported she shared the information with BM and the agency\nwhen he was sick or having a fever. She reported that Youth B\nattends his medical appointments.\n10",
    "DOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Youth B’s medical passport in MiSCWIS was reviewed.\nYouth B had numerous doctor appointments such as\nregular well-being checkup, dental appointments, MRI’s,\nEEG, neurologist and hematology appointments. The\nmedical passport showed these appointments were kept\nand reported if follow up was needed. The medical\npassport did not show that Youth B was on any\nmedications.\n• Social Work Contacts (SWC) of Youth B’s case. FCW\nentered detailed medical contacts in the SWC’s of Youth B\nin MiSACWIS. BM name was mentioned in every contact\nas knowing the medical updates for Youth B.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation reviewed, there is\ninsufficient evidence to support a rule violation as BM was made\naware of all medical information from the agency for Youth B.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n10/26/2025\n____________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/28/2025\n______________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n11"

    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted regarding allegations that Orchards Children's Services failed to properly communicate with the biological mother (BM) about her children in foster care. The investigation found that while communication regarding service plans and medical issues was adequate and no violation was established in those areas, the agency did violate policy by failing to notify the BM of a placement change when a child's temporary respite stay turned into a nearly two-month placement without her knowledge. The violation points to an agency oversight, but the report indicates the facility is generally in compliance aside from this specific failure.",
