    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth E’s mother is not allowed to bring her food.\nInvestigation Youth E, age 18, is a former resident of Vista Maria’s Myriam Hall.\nThe program is designed for youth transitioning out of the juvenile\nor foster care system. Youth E was discharged to her mother\nshortly after these allegations were made.\nI received information from Government Worker 1 that\nComplainant, also Youth J’s mother, is hyperverbal and unable to\nfocus while communicating. During a previous investigation\ninvolving her daughter, Complainant sent the worker 88 texts, and\nnumerous unrequested photos and documents. It is suspected\nComplainant may have serious mental health issues. For this\nreason, I did not contact her to elicit additional information or\nconcerns.\nI interviewed Therapist with Rights Officer present. She has\nworked for the agency for 12 years. Therapist stated Youth E’s\nmother is allowed to bring and has brought her daughter food.\nI interviewed Youth E with Rights Officer present. She said her\nmother brought fast food, dry noodles, snack cakes and soda to\nher at the facility.\nAnalysis Youth E's mother is allowed and has brought her daughter food.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n2",
    "Rule Code & Rule 400.4122 Resident and parent visitation\nSection (1) An institution shall provide for visits between each resident and\nDescription the resident’s parents, unless parental rights have been\nterminated or the resident’s record contains documentation that\nvisitation is detrimental to the resident.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth E’s mother must make appointments to visit.\nInvestigation Youth E’s Therapist stated that Vista Maria’s protocol is that visits\nare by appointment only.\nI reviewed Vista Maria’s visitor policy. It indicates that visits are by\nappointment and should be made at least 24 hours in advance.\nAnalysis It is protocol at Vista Maria that parental visits are by appointment\nonly.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(c) Documentation of medical care and maintenance of health\nrecords.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth E’s medication is frequently changed implying changes are\nmade without consent. Youth E and her mother are not allowed to\nknow her Lithium dose.\nInvestigation I interviewed Youth E with Rights Officer present on 5/4/23. She\nwas referred by the Community Management Organization (CMO)\nInsight for placement at Vista Maria. Youth E said she would like\nto take Motrin, but it is not prescribed. Rights Officer explained\nthat her doctor advised against it due to interactive side effects\nwith other medication. Youth E agreed to discuss the matter with\nher doctor at her next medication review. I asked if Youth E knew\nher dose of Lithium. She replied, “I take 300 mg of Lithium once a\nday at night.”\n3",
    "I reviewed Youth E’s psychotropic medication consent form dated\n4/24/23. It should be noted Youth E turned 18, thus she signed\nthe consent form herself attesting her psychiatrist talked to her\nabout her medications and she had a chance to ask questions.\nYouth E signed the form again on 4/25/23 giving voluntary\nconsent to the treatment plan and indicating she agreed with the\ndoctor’s recommendations.\nTherapist said Youth E’s mother is allowed to know and does\nknow her daughter’s Lithium dose. “It was discussed with her at\nmedication reviews on 4/13/23 and 4/19/23.”\nAnalysis Proper consents accompany all medication changes. Youth E,\nage 18, and signed consent form acknowledging she agreed with\nthe changes and had an opportunity to ask questions.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Another youth attempted to hit Youth E with a chair implying a lack\nof staff supervision.\nInvestigation Youth E stated a youth threw a chair and it did not hit her. She\nsaid staff were present and got between her and the chair.\nI reviewed an incident report by Staff 1 dated 4/25/23. It indicated\nYouth E was yelling at Youth D from across the room. Initially\nYouth D responded verbally. Staff 1 attempted to deescalate the\nsituation. Youth E left the room but continued commenting so\nYouth D could hear. Youth D threw the dining room chair on the\nfloor and walked out of the unit. Youth E called her mother about\nthe incident. Her mother told Staff 1 she would “file a police\nreport, hire a detective, file a restraining order and get Youth D\nthrown out of there.”\n4",
    "I reviewed video of this incident. Youths D and B are sitting in the\ndining room and Youth E is standing gesturing at them from\nacross the room. Youths D and B respond to Youth E verbally.\nYouth E goes into another room. Youth D picks up a chair and\nholds it for several seconds. Staff 1 is talking to Youth D. Youth\nD drops the chair on the floor and walks away.\nAnalysis Video shows Youth D did not throw a chair at anyone. Staff 1 was\npresent and supervising when the incident occurred.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112 Staff qualifications\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth E’s Therapist is misadvising her to get her own apartment.\nRequested information is being held from Youth E’s mother. Law\nenforcement was called on Youth E’s mother implying Vista Maria\nstaff called them and the call was unjustified.\nInvestigation Youth E said Therapist did advise her to move into her own\napartment after discharge. Youth E, on the other hand, wants to\nlive with her mother. When the time comes, she acknowledged\nthe decision will be made through a collaborative effort involving\nthe court.\nTherapist admitted she did offer Youth E getting her own\napartment as an option after discharge along with several other\noptions to consider.\nTherapist denied withholding requested information from Youth\nE’s mother. However, she said Youth E’s mother did ask her to\nwrite a letter indicating that Youth E is not a temporary court ward.\nTherapist refused to write the letter because Youth E is a\ntemporary court ward.\nI reviewed an incident report by Staff 2 dated 5/1/23. It indicated\nYouth E’s mother had a visit scheduled for 4pm, however, she\narrived at the security gate at 1:30pm demanding access. Youth\nE’s mother threatened the security guard she would call Dearborn\nHeights police to escort her onto campus. By 2:45pm, the mother\n5",
    "had called the police and an officer arrived at the gate. The officer\nasked Staff 2 to brief him on the situation. After the briefing, due\nto the mother’s irate behaviors and argumentative tone, the officer\nrecommended that Vista Maria cancel her scheduled visit at 4pm.\nTherapist observed Youth E’s mother shows signs of paranoia,\ndisorganized thoughts, and a psychotic thought pattern. In terms\nof calling the police, she said no one from Vista Maria called them.\nThe youth’s mother called the police herself.\nAnalysis There is no evidence Therapist is misadvising Youth E or\nwithholding requested information from her mother. No staff from\nVista Maria called law enforcement on Youth E's mother. Youth\nE's mother called law enforcement herself.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMay 11, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 19, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
