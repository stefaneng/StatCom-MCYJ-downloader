    "ALLEGATION:\nThe agency failed to provide services to the family. The case was assigned to the\nagency on November 27, 2019. A referral for services was only completed on May\n1, 2020.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Chief Administrator via telephone on\nMay 12, 2020. He reported being present at a home visit with Foster Children 1’s birth\nparents on December 10, 2019. He stated he offered the birth parents services during\nthe home visit, however, they said no to the service referrals because their attorney\nadvised them to not participate as it may not be in their favor since the case had not\nbeen adjudicated. The Chief Administrator stated a Family Team Meeting (FTM) was\nheld in April 2020 and that is when the birth parents asked for services. He said in April\n2020, the agency had difficulty finding service providers for the birth parents due to\nCOVID-19.\nI interviewed Ingham County MDHHS Foster Care POS Monitor via telephone on June\n16, 2020. She said in the beginning of March 2020 she received an email from Foster\nChildren 1’s relative caregiver indicating the children have been out of the parental\nhome since Thanksgiving and no services have been provided to the birth parents.\nIngham County MDHHS Foster Care POS Monitor stated she contacted Ennis Center\nfor Children-Pontiac regarding services not being provided to the birth parents. The\nagency provided various reasons for services not being provided. She said initially the\nagency said the birth parents refused services. Then the agency informed her that CPS\nis supposed to refer the birth parents for services and since the case was not yet\nadjudicated, they could not provide services. She reported the agency also said\nservices could not be provided because everything had been shut down due to COVID-\n19. Ingham County MDHHS Foster Care POS Monitor stated the agency never\ncontacted her regarding how services for the birth parents would be paid for since the\ncase had not been adjudicated nor did they communicate to her that they could not find\nservice providers due to COVID-19. She stated the foster children have returned to the\nparental home with Family Reunification Program (FRP) services.\nI interviewed Birth Mother A via telephone on June 16, 2020. Birth Mother A stated in\nthe very beginning she and the birth father refused to participate in services because\ntheir attorney told them that it would not help their case if they participated in services\nsince the case had not been adjudicated. She reported in February 2020, they decided\nthat it would be best to participate in services and they asked Ennis Center for Children-\nPontiac Foster Care Worker A to refer them to services. Birth Mother A said Ennis\nCenter for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Worker A stated MDHHS had to pay for the\nservices because MDHHS had jurisdiction of the case. She reported services were still\nnot in place in April 2020, so she asked the agency again about the services. She\nstated FRP services and substance abuse services were put in place in May 2020.\n3",
    "I interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Supervisor A via telephone\non June 16, 2020. She stated services were offered to the birth parents within 30 days\nof Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac accepting case responsibility. However, the birth\nparents refused to participate in services because they said their attorney told them that\nby participating in services shows that they are admitting guilt. She said the birth\nparents refused to participate in services until mid-April 2020. Ennis Center for\nChildren-Pontiac Foster Care Supervisor A reported the birth parents agreed to\nparticipate in services during the April 2020 FTM. She reported the agency had issues\nwith finding service providers due to COVID-19. She stated the birth parents were given\nonline resources for parenting classes and FRP services were put in the home once the\nfoster children were returned home. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care\nSupervisor A reported approximately a couple of weeks before the April 2020 FTM she\ndiscussed with Ingham County MDHHS Foster Care POS Monitor that MDHHS would\npay for services prior to the case being adjudicated.\nI reviewed Foster Children 1's case in MiSACWIS on June 16, 2020 and June 18, 2020.\nMiSACWIS documented the following:\n Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac accepted Foster Children 1’s case on\nNovember 27, 2019.\n The Initial Service Plan (ISP) report period was from November 27, 2019 to\nDecember 26, 2019. The ISP stated, “The children and parents have been\noffered foster care case management and visitation. This case has not been\nadjudicated; however, the parents were offered to start services voluntarily but\nrefused. The parents refuse to participate until the court orders them.”\n The Updated Service Plan (USP) report period was from December 27, 2019 to\nMarch 25, 2020. A face-to-face social work contact with the birth parents and\nEnnis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Worker A dated January 21, 2020\nstated the birth parents were given a copy of the PATP. They were asked to read\nover the PATP and sign it at the end, acknowledging that they read, agree, or\ndisagree and received a copy. The birth parents both refused to sign the PATP,\nstating that they did not agree with what was being stated and they wanted to\nspeak with their attorney first.\n Foster Children 1’s birth parents signed the ISP Parent Agency Treatment Plan\n(PATP) on January 21, 2020 and wrote, “Refuse to sign until we speak to\nlawyer.” Foster Children 1’s birth parents signed the USP PATP on April 23,\n2020.\n A FTM was completed on March 5, 2020. The birth parents attended the FTM but\ndid not sign the FTM activity report. The FTM activity report indicated the birth\nparents report being willing to do whatever they can to get their children back\nhome. It also stated the birth parents have reported they do not have the\nfinancial means to go out and pay for services on their own.\n A FTM was completed on April 14, 2020. The birth parents attended the FTM.\nThe FTM activity report indicated the birth parents have not participated in any\nservices. It stated the birth parents are willing to participate in services. Ennis\nCenter for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Worker A is to provide birth parents with\n4",
    "referrals and resources for parenting time and anger management. It stated that\nthere is a possibility of returning the children home with FRP services.\n Foster Children 1 were returned to the birth parents’ home on May 22, 2020 with\nFRP services.\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Worker A via telephone on\nJune 18, 2020. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Worker A stated during\nthe ISP report period, the Chief Administrator offered the birth parents service referrals\nat an initial home visit with the birth parents, however, the birth parents said that their\nattorney instructed them not to participate in services as it would admit guilt. She stated\nduring the first USP report period, the birth parents still refused to participate in services\nvoluntarily because they could not afford them. She stated all MDHHS counties are\ndifferent when it comes to paying for services and she was unaware that Ingham\nCounty MDHHS would pay for services prior to the case being adjudicated. Ennis\nCenter for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Worker A reported that she does not recall one\nway or the other if the birth parents requested to participate in services in February\n2020. She stated that once the birth parents agreed to complete services COVID-19\noccurred and it was difficult to find providers to service the birth parents. She stated she\ndid not ask Ingham County MDHHS Foster Care POS Monitor for assistance in\nobtaining services to the birth parents as she thought that every county handled\npayment of services the same not knowing that Ingham County MDHHS would pay for\nthe services.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\nMDHHS Policy Service Referrals.\nFOM 722-06\nFront Loading Services\nFront loading services is an essential component of\nconcurrent permanency planning that includes immediate\nreferrals for needed services at the beginning of a case; see\nFOM 722-07A, Concurrent Permanency Planning. The\nassigned caseworker must make appropriate service\n5",
    "referrals for the family, as soon as possible, but no later\nthan 30 calendar days after entry into care.\nIf the service provider is unable to immediately provide the\nservice, the caseworker must document in the case service\nplan that the service is unavailable and identify the date\nthat the service will become available.\nIf the service is unavailable for more than 30 calendar days,\nthe caseworker must determine if other service providers\noffer the same or similar service and make a referral. If it is\ndetermined that there is no secondary service provider\navailable, the caseworker must locate alternate service\nproviders and document these efforts in the case service\nplan.\nANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to show that Ennis Center for\nChildren-Pontiac failed to provide Foster Children 1’s birth\nparents service referrals no later than 30 calendar days after\nentry into care. The ISP, the ISP PATP and Birth Mother A’s\naccount indicate that the birth parents refused to participate in\nservices stating that their attorney advised them not to\nparticipate until the court adjudicated the case.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nDuring a review of MiSACWIS, it was determined that a FTM for the ISP was not\ncompleted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Worker A via telephone on\nJune 18, 2020. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care Worker A stated during\nthe ISP report period she was attending Child Welfare Training Institute and does not\nknow if a FTM was completed for the ISP report period.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nDHHS Policy Family Team Meetings: Types and Timeframes.\nFOM 722-06B\nThe following events shall trigger FTM for out of home\ncases:\n• Case Plan Development/ Reassessment:\nInitial Case Plan (ISP) - within 30 calendar days before the\ncase plan due date.\n6",
    "Note: This FTM may be combined with the CPS Case\nOpening (ISP) FTM.\nUpdated Case Plan (USP) - within 30 calendar days before\nthe case plan due date.\nDocumentation\nThe DHS-1105, FTM Report, must be completed for every\nFTM.\nANALYSIS: A FTM for the ISP was not documented in MiSACWIS as being\ncompleted. Ennis Center for Children-Pontiac Foster Care\nWorker A stated during the ISP report period she was attending\nChild Welfare Training Institute and does not know if a FTM was\ncompleted for the ISP report period.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend the agency’s\nregular license status continue.\nJune 29, 2020\n________________________________________\nAlicia Wiggins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 1, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n7"
