    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 12/12/20, a staff member at the facility made inappropriate comments to a youth.\nStaff member asked youth who the best masturbator on the pod was, if youth\nthought another staff member was attractive, and inquired if youth was purchasing\nthat staff member a gift. Staff then began asking the youth a series of inappropriate\nquestions such as if he “pisses” in the shower. Staff then told youth if he said\nanything about the discussion there would be consequences.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A (Male, age 15) reported that Staff 1 made inappropriate comments to him.\nInterviews were held at the facility on December 15, 2020 with DHHS Investigator 2.\nYouth A said that on November 26, 2020, Staff 1 said while in the breakfast line to\nYouth A and other youth standing waiting, “Who masturbates the best? “Youth A\nsaid this question of Staff 1 “came out of the blue”. Youth A said that he and other\nyouth were uncomfortable with Staff 1’s question. Youth A said that Staff 1 said at\nanother time, “Do you piss in the shower?” Youth A said he answered no, and he\nsaid Staff 1 then said, “Why not, I do” Youth A could not give a timeframe for that\ncomment.\nYouth A asked Youth C, “How much does Youth C’s mom sucks dick?” Youth A said\nStaff 1 overheard his comment to Youth C and then Staff 1 said to Youth A, “How\nmuch does your mom suck dick?”\nYouth A said that Staff 1 asked the group of youth if they thought Staff 8 “had a nice\nbehind?” Youth A said that Staff 1 asked him what he was going to buy Staff 8 for\nher birthday. Youth A said that Staff 1 told him that Staff 8 would be the perfect\nmatch for him, stating she could “do my dishes”.\nYouth C was also interviewed on December 15, 2020 with DHHS Investigator 2. He\nsaid that Staff 1 “asked the boys on the pod who was the best masturbator?” Youth\nC said he was not sure when this occurred, but it was about 3 p.m. last month.\nYouth C said that Youth A had told him about Staff 1 talking about peeing in the\nshower.\nYouth D and Youth B were interviewed by DHHS Investigator 2 and me on\nDecember 15, 2020 at the facility. Youth D said that while in their rooms on\nDecember 12, 2020 at about 8 a.m. Staff 1 said to a group of youth “Who is the best\nmasturbator?” Youth B said Staff 1 asked “the pod” “Who the biggest masturbator\nwas?” Youth B said that this occurred when they were sitting around a table on Pod\n4. Youth B said he did not know why Staff 1 asked this question because they were\nnot talking about masturbation. Youth B said this occurred the first- or second-day\nStaff 1 was assigned to the pod.",
    "Youth A’s case file was reviewed and Staff 1’s employee file. Staff 1 began at Bay\nPines Center in September 2020. Prior to Bay Pines Center, Staff 1 worked at\nShawono Center for four and half years.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on December 17, 2020 with DHHS Investigator 2 who was at\nthe facility and I was connected by telephone. Staff 1 admitted he did make a\ncomment about masturbation but was unsure when this had occurred. Staff 1 said it\nwas soon after he began of Boys 4. He said it was meant as a joke or icebreaker but\nrealized that he never should have said that. Staff 1 did not remember his exact\nwords, but it was to the effect, “Who is the biggest/best masturbator in this group?”\nStaff 1 denied that he made comments about peeing in the shower or comments\nabout Staff 8. Staff 1 said about Staff 8, “She is 21 and I am 54, I am way too old for\nher.”\nBay Pines Center’s policy manual was reviewed, and the following policy Staff 1\nviolated:\nPOLICY 115—STAFF ETHICS\nStaff will not engage in any behavior that brings reproach upon the staff, employer,\nor the State of Michigan by illegally discriminating against any individual or group\nbecause of age, color, disability, genetic information, height, weight, marital status,\nnational origin, partisan considerations, race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation,\nor by engaging in inappropriate, unprofessional, or unsafe relationships with facility\nresidents or past residents. In addition, staff will not convert state property for\npersonal use, and will respect both the property and rights of others.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1’s comment, which was acknowledged by all interviewed,\nwas not appropriate and is in violation of the facility’s policies\nand procedures.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that there be no change to the licensing status of this public child\ncaring institution, upon the receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan which\nfocuses on training and close supervision of Staff 1.\nMarch 4, 2021\n________________________________________\nDon Collier Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 4, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager"
