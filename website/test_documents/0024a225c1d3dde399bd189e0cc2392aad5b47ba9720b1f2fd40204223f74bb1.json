There was\ninsufficient staff to stop the fight sooner. Youth A has significant injuries and is afraid\nto return to the facility.\nINVESTIGATION:\nReceived complaint on 05/12/2022 and investigated in collaboration with DHHS\nSpecialist.\nI interviewed Youth B at school on 05/12/2022, in collaboration with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Youth B reported she lives in a group home with three other children. She\nlikes the staff and has a good relationship with all the girls except Youth A. She said\nlast week Youth A stole things from her room and they got into a fight. She and\nYouth A got in another fight two days ago, because Youth A was teasing her about\nher family, so she threw a cup a of water at her. She went to her bedroom and Youth\nA followed her and hit her with a belt. She said there were two staff members, and\nthey were trying to stop the fight, but Youth A kept coming after her. Staff took the\nbelt away and Youth A then hit her on the arms with a hairbrush. She tried to choke\nYouth A and Youth A punched her in the nose. Staff were able to separate them and\nstop the fight. Her nose was bleeding, so staff gave her an ice pack for her nose.\nYouth B pulled up her shirt sleeves and her arms had multiple bruises and scratch\nmarks. She reported there is usually three staff present but that evening there was\nonly two. Youth B reported not being afraid to go home but does not like that Youth\nA is always starting fights with her.\nI interviewed Youth A and Youth B’s Foster Care Specialist at the school on\n05/12/2022, in collaboration with DHHS Specialist. She is the foster care worker for\nboth girls. She reported that the Chief Administrator notified her about the fight and\nknows that there has been issues with both girls since their placement at the facility.\nYouth B had a medical exam on 05/11/2022 and her exam was normal besides the\n3",
    "bruises on her arms. Youth A had a reevaluation by her psychiatrist, and they are\nmaking changes to her medication. She reports Youth B was the first one placed at\nthe facility and has been instigating fights with Youth A. She is looking into finding\nanother placement for Youth A due to her aggressive behavior.\nI interviewed School Administrator on 05/12/2022 at the school, in collaboration with\nDHHS Specialist. She reported on 05/11/2022 the school nurse saw Youth because\nshe had a headache and was not feeling well. The school contacted the CA at the\nfacility and Youth B was picked up for her scheduled doctor appointment that\nafternoon.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 05/12/2022, in collaboration with DHHS\nSpecialist. Youth A is 11 years old and is in the fifth grade. She has been at the\nfacility for one month. She said she feels safe and has a good relationship with all\nthe staff and youths except Youth B. She and Youth B got into it last week because\nYouth B was teasing her during group therapy. On 05/10/22, Youth B threw water in\nher face, so she punched Youth B in the face. She reported Youth B also punched\nand kicked her, but she does not have any bruises or marks. She said staff\nseparated them and she went outside with staff to calm down. While she was\noutside Youth B went into her bedroom and ripped her pictures. She went after\nYouth B, punched her nose, and made her nose bleed. She said the staff were trying\nto stop the fight, but she and Youth B kept fighting. She said at one point Youth B\nstopped fighting, but she went to the kitchen to grab a fork and stab Youth B. She\nreported CA blocked her from entering Youth B’s bedroom and Staff 1 kept trying to\ncalm her down. She finally calmed down and went to her bedroom. She said she has\nbeen restrained once since placed at the facility. She expressed no worries or\nconcerns. She said she is getting enough to eat, gets her medication daily, and feels\nsafe.\nI interviewed CA at Adrian Group Home on 05/12/2022, in collaboration with DHHS\nSpecialist. She reported the facility opened in March and they currently have four\nyouths. On 05/10/22 there were three staff scheduled to work the afternoon shift,\none staff member resigned, and another staff called in sick, so she filled in that shift.\nShe typically has two or three staff on second shift not including her. On the day in\nquestion, they were within the ratio of 2:1, but they had a challenging time\nseparating the two youths that got into a fight. She said there was tension between\nthe two youths from an incident the week prior. On 05/10/22 during dinner Youth B\nwas antagonizing Youth A, so they started to argue. The situation escalated when\nYouth A threatened Youth B, so she instructed the all the girls to go to their rooms.\nYouth A and Youth B refused and charged at each other. They started hitting and\npunching each other, so she and Staff 1 separated them. Youth A grabbed a belt\nand was trying to hit Youth B. She and the other staff were trying to separate the two\ngirls again by blocking and taking objects away. Both youths were escalated and\nextremely aggressive. Youth A kept trying to grab different objects (belt, hairbrush,\nspoon,) to hit Youth B and Staff 1 kept taking the objects away. They were able to\nseparate the two youths multiple times, but they kept instigating and attacking each\n4",
    "other. It took about one hour to get the two girls under control and calm down. She\nsaid Youth B’s nose was bleeding, so they helped clean her up and gave her an ice\npack. Youth B did not report any distress or pain after the fight. On 05/11/2022\nYouth B had a medical exam, which was normal except for the bruising on her arms.\nThe youths were not restrained because there were only two staff on shift, and she\nfelt it would not be safe for the youths or staff if they restrained one of the youths.\nShe said there was an incident last week with both youths and they had three staff\non shift, so they were able to control the situation by each staff taking one youth into\nanother room. She has requested while the youths are at the facility that they have a\nleast three staff on second shift and she is going to keep the two youths separated.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 05/12/2022, in collaboration with DHHS\nSpecialist. Staff 1 has been employed at the facility for six months. She reported\nthere has been tension between Youth A and Youth B since last week. On 05/10/22\nYouth B instigated the fight by teasing Youth A at dinner. She took Youth A’s seat at\nthe dinner table, and threw a cup of water at Youth A. She said that set off Youth A\nand she charged at Youth B. She and the CA tried to separate and block the two\ngirls, but the two youths kept going after each other every time they separated them.\nShe said they could not restrain the two youths because they did not have enough\nstaff to ensure that the two youths would not go after each other. At one point she\ngot Youth A to go outside to calm down, but Youth B went to Youth A’s bedroom and\ntrashed it. Youth A was extremely angry and went after Youth B again. Youth A\npunched Youth B in the face and gave her a bloody nose. They final got the two girls\nseparated and calmed down. She said they looked over Youth B and found she had\nbruises, but she did not seem to be distress or seriously injured. They did give her\nan ice pack for the nosebleed. She reported they typically have three staff on second\nshift. She said they would have restrained Youth A if they had a third staff member\npresent.\nDocuments reviewed for the investigation:\n Well Child Exam report dated 05/11/2022. Youth B’s exam was normal except\nfor bruising on her arms. No medical treatment provided.\n Incident report, dated 05/10/2022, written by Staff 1. The report was\nconsistent with Staff 1’s interview.\n Facility’s policy for Physical Restraint Interventions.\n Facility’s Staff requirements and supervision.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Upon completion of the investigation, sufficient evidence was found\nto confirm that agency staff failed to provide adequate supervision\nof residents to ensure safety. Youth A and Youth B admitted they\ngot into a physical fight resulting in Youth B sustaining bruises\non her arms and a bloody nose. Staff confirmed they could not\nadequately control the situation to prevent the two Youths from\nhurting each other.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\n06/27/2022\n_____________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n06/29/2022\n_____________________________________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n6"

    "summary": "A physical fight between two youths (Youth A and Youth B) occurred at the Adrian Group Home on May 10, 2022, resulting in injuries including bruises and a bloody nose for Youth B. The investigation found that while staff-to-youth ratios were technically met, only two staff were on duty instead of the typical three, and they were insufficient to safely control the escalating situation or effectively separate the youths, leading to a prolonged altercation. The evidence substantiates a violation of staffing rules, placing clear culpability on the facility for failing to provide adequate supervision to ensure resident safety.",

    "level": "severe",
    "justification": "The investigation substantiated a violation of staff sufficiency leading to inadequate supervision. This resulted in a prolonged physical assault between youths (Youth A and Youth B) involving hitting, punching, choking, and the use of objects (belt, hairbrush) as weapons, causing significant injuries including bruising and a bloody nose. The incident constitutes youth-on-youth violence, a criterion under the 'Safety and Violence' category for severe SIRs."
