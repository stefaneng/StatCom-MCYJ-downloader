It was reported that the foster care worker\nbecame aware of this youth’s marijuana use upon placement and\nwithin weeks developed a plan with the foster parent and the\nyouth for the youth to access and use marijuana. This included the\nfoster parent being the one to provide marijuana to the youth, and\na reward system that if the youth followed the rules, the youth\nwould be allowed marijuana.\nAllegation 2:\nThe foster care worker contacted the foster parent to advise her\nabout the special evaluation and or what to say when interviewed.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAllegation 1\n2",
    "Complainant\nOn 7/18/2024 I interviewed the complainant by telephone.\nInformation reported was as reported by the Licensing worker.\nLicensing Worker (LW)\nOn 7/18/2024 I interviewed Licensing Worker (LW) by telephone.\nLW reported he became aware of the allegations during a special\nevaluation he was conducting on Foster Parent 1 related to a\ncomplaint alleging Foster Parent 1 was smoking marijuana with\nYouth A. He interviewed both Foster Parent 1 and Youth A\nLW reported when he interviewed Foster Parent 1, a young foster\nparent who had only been fostering for six months, Foster Parent\n1 denied smoking marijuana with Youth A. Foster Parent 1\nadmitted Youth A’s foster care worker told her that Youth A had a\nhistory of marijuana and alcohol use. Because of that, Foster\nParent 1 said she initially refused to allow Youth A to smoke.\nFoster Parent 1 admitted there came a time she allowed Youth A\nto smoke marijuana. Foster Parent 1 reported she took Youth A to\na friend’s home, where Youth A was given marijuana and allowed\nto smoke. Foster Parent 1 said she facilitated the situation and\nmonitored Youth A’s marijuana smoking. LW said Foster Parent 1\nreported she did so, because when she had expressed concern\nabout Youth A smoking marijuana to Foster Care Worker (FCW),\nFCW made it seem as though it was not a big issue or concern.\nWhen she mentioned the possibility of allowing Youth A to smoke\nwith supervision, FCW was okay with it. FCW reported if Youth A\nhas to smoke to make sure it was done responsibly. Foster Parent\n1 reported after that she developed rules to make sure Youth A’s\nmarijuana use was safe, as opposed to Youth A using it with\npeers without supervision. LW said Foster Parent 1 told him she\nmonitored Youth A’s marijuana usage on two occasions, in May\n2024. LW said Foster Parent 1 told him there was a third occasion\naround 6/7/2024, when Youth A had stolen a joint and smoked it\nwithout her supervision. Foster Parent 1 reported when Youth A\nsmoked the stolen joint without her supervision, Youth A was\nbreaking the rules they had established. Foster Parent 1 then took\naway Youth A’s supervised marijuana usage, and she took away\nYouth A’s phone. LW did not report whether Foster Parent 1\nindicated discussing her decision to remove Youth A’s marijuana\nsmoking privilege with FCW. Foster Parent 1 said the agreement\nfor Youth A’s marijuana usage was verbal, nothing was written\nout.\nLW reported during his interview with Youth A, Youth A reported\nshe and Foster Parent 1 smoked marijuana at Foster Parent 1’s\n3",
    "friend’s house twice during the month of May 2024. Youth A\nreported there were rules established around when she would be\nallowed to smoke. That being when Foster Parent 1 was around\nand could supervise her. Provided she had been following house\nand school rules and expectations.\nYouth A:\nOn 7/19/2024 Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)\nWorker, LW and I interviewed Youth A (age17) onsite at the\nagency. Youth A affirmed information reported by LW related to\nhis licensing interview with her related to there being an\nagreement with the foster parent around her smoking marijuana.\nYouth A reported she smoked marijuana with Foster Parent 1\nonce at Foster Parent 1’s best friend, Person B’s house. Youth A\nsaid, Person B brought out a joint and they all passed it around\nand smoked it. Youth A reported after a while her placement with\nFoster Parent 1 became difficult, because she was not following\nthe household rules, and she did not like how Foster Parent 1 was\ntalking to her. She said she smoked marijuana once at school, but\nthen she started smoking marijuana in the backyard. She also\nstole a joint from Person B and smoked it. She said, there came a\ntime when Foster Parent 1 made a big deal about her smoking\nwhen she had not, and so she thought Foster Parent 1 was\nteasing her. She said Foster Parent 1 never told her not to tell\nthat she was smoking marijuana. And Foster Parent 1 never\nforced her to use marijuana, because she could have said no,\nwhen asked to smoke.\nYouth A reported FCW never knew she was smoking “weed” with\nFoster Parent 1. She reported not knowing whether Foster Parent\n1 told FCW they were smoking weed or smoking it in the\nbackyard. She denied knowing exactly how FCW became aware\nof her smoking marijuana. She said maybe FCW and Foster\nParent 1 were texting about it. She stated that FCW knew weed\nsmoking was a part of her past, from her prior placement, not that\nshe was smoking with Foster Parent 1. She denied smoking came\nup during FCW’s visits to Foster Parent 1’s home.\nYouth A also denied that anyone told her what to say during her\ninterview with us today. She said the person who developed a\nsafety plan with her around the marijuana was Foster Parent 1,\nand that it occurred around May 2024.\nDHHS Worker & LW\nOn 7/19/2024 following Youth A’s onsite agency interview, LW\nand DHHS reported information to me related to the allegations.\n4",
    "LW reported Youth A’s statement today had changed from what\nwas reported to him in an earlier interview. Youth A, FCW and\nFoster Parent 1 seemed to be uniting and changing their stories\nabout FCW’s awareness of Youth A’s marijuana usage and Foster\nParent 1’s involvement. He reported there is a text message\nbetween FCW and Foster Parent 1, where FCW appears to give\nFoster Parent 1 a head’s up about the foster home investigation.\nAdditionally, DHHS Worker reported that FCW took Youth A out\nfor a meeting just prior to Youth A’s interview with us today. The\nconcern was whether Youth A may have been coached by FCW\nafter FCW was told not to have further contact with Youth A\npending the completion of the investigation. DHHS Worker and\nLW also reported it came to the agency’s attention that on\n7/5/2024 FCW confided to a coworker, Family Preservation\nAssistant (FPA) that she had knowledge of Youth’s A marijuana\ndrug use.\nFamily Preservation Assistant (FPA)\nOn 7/19/2024 DHHS Worker, LW and I interviewed FPA onsite at\nthe agency. FPA reported being an Intern with the agency. She\nreported FCW knew Youth A was smoking marijuana. She said\non 7/5/204 FCW came to her office, and they chatted about how\nYouth A was doing. At that time, FCW told her Youth A was upset\nwith Foster Parent 1 because Foster Parent 1 won’t let her smoke\nweed with her anymore. That Youth A was feeling Foster Parent 1\nwas teasing her, that this happened after Foster Parent 1 caught\nher smoking and drinking and became upset with her. FPA said\nFCW told her Youth A and Foster Parent 1 used to smoke\ntogether. FPA reported after FCW shared this information with\nher, she asked FCW whether that was illegal and FCW responded\n“it was in a supervised environment”. FPA said she told FCW that\nbehavior was inappropriate. FCW responded “I don’t know, I can’t\ndeal with it,” and FCW did not want to talk about the matter\nfurther.\nFPA said FCW never told her that FCW had smoked marijuana.\nNor was there a conversation between her and FCW as to\nwhether FCW reported the matter of Foster Parent 1 smoking\nmarijuana with Youth A to the agency supervisor or another\nadministrative staff. FPA took it upon herself to report the matter\nto Foster Care Supervisor on 7/8/2024. FPA said sometime later\nFCW confronted her about the fact that she reported the matter to\nFCS.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\n5",
    "On 7/19/2024 DHHS Worker, LW and I interviewed FCW onsite at\nthe agency. FCW’s demeanor during the interview is worth noting\ndue to the fact she often laughed or smirked at various questions\nput forth to her, and she raised her voice when answering or\nremarking or rolled her eyes at remarks or questions that we\nraised.\nFCW reported being Youth A’s case worker. She reported\nbecoming aware of Youth A’s past marijuana use at a TDM (Team\nDecision Meeting) in October 2023 while Youth A was placed with\nher brother. The brother brought up Youth A’s drug use at the\nmeeting, because he was concerned with Youth A smoking while\non certain medications. FCW said she took the matter up with the\nyouth’s therapist. She reported the therapist basically reported it\nwas okay. The therapist reported that although smoking marijuana\nwas not a good coping mechanism, Youth A will continue to use\nany way given her age. FCW reported the agency team members\nall knew Youth A had a past history of smoking marijuana. She\nsaid she had several conversations with Youth A about good\ncoping mechanisms other than marijuana use. She reported she\nhad safety planned with Youth A around her marijuana issue, but\nlater during this interview she changed her reporting and said she\nhad not.\nFCW denied knowledge of Youth A and Foster Parent 1 smoking\nmarijuana together. She reported Youth A was placed with Foster\nParent 1 in April 2024. She told Foster Parent 1 about Youth A’s\nmarijuana drug use as a part of Youth A’s past history, but that\nYouth A was not actively using marijuana. She reported since\nYouth A’s marijuana use was a past history issue, she did not\nexpand on the matter further with Foster Parent 1. She reported in\nMay 2024 Foster Parent 1 told her that she had caught Youth A\nwith marijuana after school. FCW did not know where Youth A\nwas getting the marijuana from. Foster Parent 1 did not know\neither. FCW admitted a safety plan was not discussed or\ncompleted with Foster Parent 1 and Youth A at that time. She\nstated she might have completed a social work contact about her\nconservation with the foster parent. She reported in June 2024,\nduring a foster home visit, Foster Parent 1 reported finding Youth\nA with marijuana again, to which Youth A initially said she found it,\nthen that it was taken from the Foster Parent 1’s friend. FCW\nadmitted she did not speak with or confront Youth A about her\nmarijuana use at this time. Nor did she discuss or complete a\nsafety plan.\n6",
    "FCW denied condoning Youth A’s marijuana use. She denied\ncondoning or giving an okay for a plan by Foster Parent 1 to\nsmoke with or supervise Youth A’s marijuana use. FCW was\nasked whether Youth A ever told her she and Foster Parent 1\nsmoked weed together and FCW stated “Not that I can recall”.\nWhen asked whether she ever texted Foster Parent 1 about the\nfoster parent and Youth A smoking marijuana, FCW said, “No”.\nFoster Parent 2\nOn 7/19/2024 DHHS Worker, LW and I interviewed Foster Parent\n2 onsite at the agency. Foster Parent 2 reported Youth A was a\nrespite placement with her. She reported her initial awareness of\nYouth A’s marijuana drug use came from Youth A. Youth A told\nher Youth A’s therapist was in agreement with it, that marijuana\nuse was a coping mechanism for her. Youth A told her that when\nshe smoked marijuana, she smoked with Foster Parent 1, and\nFoster Parent 1’s friend. Foster Parent 2 said she immediately\n“shut that down”. She told Youth A that her smoking marijuana\nwas not something that will happen at her home. Foster Parent 2\nsaid on 7/11/2024, she messaged FCW about what Youth A\nreported. FCW told her she does not sit in on Youth A’s therapist\nsessions but what Youth A reported was what she understood to\nbe correct. FCW mentioned knowing that Foster Parent 1 had\nallowed Youth A to smoke marijuana in Foster Parent 1’s home.\nFCW mentioned it as a concern, but FCW did not report what was\ndone about it. Foster Parent 2 reported FCW understood that\nallowing Youth A to smoke weed was not something she would\nallow. FCW advised her to go ahead and enforced her rule to not\nallow Youth A’s marijuana use.\nFoster Parent 1\nOn 7/22/2024 and 7/23/2024 I interviewed Foster Parent 1 by\ntelephone. Foster Parent 1 provided additional information to me\nvia email on 7/26/2024. Foster Parent 1 affirmed Youth A’s\nplacement with her occurring in April 2024. She denied several\ntimes that she smoked marijuana with Youth A but admitted to\nallowing and supervising Youth A’s use of marijuana at least\ntwice. She also denied providing the marijuana to Youth A. She\nadmitted she had smoked in front of Youth A, while they were at\nthe same location. She indicated she was in the garage and Youth\nA would come out occasionally. Foster Parent 1 could not recall if\nshe told FCW this, but she reported she had told FCW Youth A\nhad stolen weed from her friend, Person B.\nFoster Parent 1 reported the initial information told to her about\nYouth A was that Youth A had an issue of running away, and that\n7",
    "she cognitively functioned like a 13-year-old. She said she also\nreceived written paperwork on Youth A that showed information,\nthat when Youth A was in placement with her brother, Youth A\nwould sneak out and smoke marijuana with her peers. Foster\nParent 1 said she asked FCW it, but FCW did not indicate what\nFoster Parent 1 should do if Youth A started smoking marijuana\nagain. Foster Parent 1 said there did come a time that Youth A\nstarted smoking marijuana, which was sometime in May 2024.\nYouth A told FCW that Youth A got marijuana from a friend and\nFCW informed Foster Parent 1 of this information. She said there\nalso came a time that Youth A reported finding a joint, but it was\nlater revealed Youth A stole the marijuana joint from Person B.\nFoster Parent 1 said FCW did not tell her how to address the\nissue or what to do with Youth A on the matter of Youth A smoking\nmarijuana. Foster Parent 1 stated, “I was sort of left to decide the\npunishment.” She reported she allowed Youth A to smoke\nmarijuana. She explained she made an agreement with Youth A\nthat if Youth A followed the rules, Youth A could smoke marijuana\nat Person B’s, if Person B decided to smoke. Foster Parent 1\nreported that during a visit to Person B’s home, Person B decided\nto smoke marijuana, so Youth A was allowed to smoke with\nPerson B. Person B provided the marijuana. Foster Parent 1\ndenied engaging in smoking marijuana with Youth A and Person B\nat that time. She supervised/monitored Youth A’s marijuana\nsmoking. She admitted there may have been other guests during\nthat event because Person B usually had other friends, who are of\nage, over to her home. Foster Parent 1 admitted there was at\nleast one other occasion, that occurred about two weeks after the\nfirst event, where she allowed and supervised Youth A smoking\nmarijuana at Person B’s home. Foster Parent 1 said it was one\njoint and Youth A was allowed to take puffs because Youth A had\nbeen behaving and following the rules.\nFoster Parent 1 said there came a time she shared what she was\ndoing/had done with FCW. She said she discussed the matter with\nFCW during a home visit. She said she discussed it with FCW\nmore than once. She was not sure if she reported Youth A’s\nsmoking was allowed as a reward, but she surmised she had. She\nsaid FCW usually came out when Youth A had behavior issues,\nand she would tell FCW what she was planning about Youth A’s\nbehavior, so she may have told FCW the weed smoking was a\nreward. Foster Parent 1 did not recall what FCW said, but FCW\ndid not object, tell her not to do it, or that it was against the\nrules. Foster Parent 1 reported she took this to mean it was okay\nfor her to do it.\n8",
    "She reported allowing Youth A to smoke weed was not her initial\nintention. When Youth A first came to her home, she told\nYouth A there would be no smoking and no drinking. After Youth A\nwas sneaking and using and not being truthful, she didn’t see the\npoint in fighting with Youth A about it and with no objection to it\nfrom FCW she took it to mean it was okay for Youth A to smoke\nmarijuana. She thinks now FCW is trying to set her up.\nFoster Parent 1 reported Youth A never told her directly that\nFCW was okay with her smoking weed, but Youth A implied that.\nFoster Parent 1 reported when Youth A was pushing her to allow\nher to smoke weed, Youth A said, “I don’t know what the big deal\nis, I smoked “with FCW in FCW’s care”. Foster Parent 1 said\nYouth A mentioned that after the first time Foster Parent 1 allowed\nYouth A to smoke weed. Youth A did not report when that\nsituation occurred with FCW and Foster Parent 1 never asked\nFCW about what Youth A alleged.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nOn 7/24/2024 FCS was interviewed by DHHS Worker and me via\nTEAMS, with Chief Administrator present. I also reviewed FCS\nemails related to her contact with FPA and FCW on 7/8/2024.\nFCS reported being aware of Youth A’s past marijuana use not\nthat Youth A had been using in Foster Parent 1’s home.\nShe reported similar information as FCW related to what Youth\nA’s brother had reported about Youth A’s marijuana use. FCS said\nwhen Youth A was replaced to Foster Parent 1 home, Youth A\nwas away from her prior school and classmates, and it was\nbelieved her use and ability to gain access to the substance had\nstopped. FCS reported, up until FPA brought the matter to her\nattention on 7/8/2024 she was not aware that Youth A was\ncurrently smoking marijuana or that Foster Parent 1 was allowing\nit or smoking with her. Likewise, she did not know Foster Parent 1\nhad an okay from FCW to allow Youth A to smoke marijuana or to\nsmoke it supervised. FCS said FCW never shared this information\nwith her, nor came directly to her to talk about Youth A smoking\nmarijuana or any concerns in that area. She said if FCW had\nbrought it up she would have addressed the issue appropriately.\nShe said on 7/8/2024 she spoke with FCW and FCW would not\ndirectly answer her questions about the matter. FCW said “We all\nknew Youth A had a history of smoking marijuana”. FCS reported\nno knowledge of an FTM where a therapist or anyone approved\nYouth A’s use of marijuana or tobacco as a coping mechanism.\nShe reported that would not be something the agency would\ncondone.\n9",
    "Therapist\nOn 8/6/2024 I interviewed Therapist by telephone. Therapist\nreported she provided biweekly therapy for Youth A from\n10/22/2023 until 6/19/2024. Therapist reported her contact with\nYouth A and the foster parent was trauma focused around safety\ndue to Youth A having suicidal ideations during moments of crisis.\nShe said she had contact with FCW in late April around getting an\nemergency assessment for Youth A because Youth A had made\nsome suicidal statements. She reported there was not an initial\ntreatment goal established around substance use for Youth A.\nShe said there never were any goals established around Youth A’s\nmarijuana use because Youth A continued to deny marijuana use.\nTherapist affirmed there had been an FTM, which she reported\nwas on 9/15/2023, where the caregiver at that time, reported he\nfound marijuana on Youth A and he took it away. Therapist said\nthere was nothing specific related to Youth A’s substance use\nafter that. She said education was provided about substance\nuse, and there was discussion about positive coping mechanisms,\nbut there was never a discussion with Youth A, her foster\nparent, and FCW about Youth A being allowed to use marijuana\nunder supervision as a coping mechanism. Therapist reported that\nis not something she would ever recommend or condone.\nTherapist reported her last contact with FCW was in June 2024.\nDocuments Reviewed\nYouth A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• Youth A is a permanent court ward.\n• She was placed in Foster Parent 1’s home on 4/29/2024\nand was replaced on 7/18/2024 to Foster Parent 2’s foster\nhome.\n• She was place at Vista Maria on 7/31/2024\nFoster Parent 1’s special evaluation report which indicated: the\nadmissions as reported by Youth A and Foster Parent 1. That the\nspecial evaluation found the foster home in violation of the foster\nhome applicant qualification rule; and the agency recommended\nrevocation of Foster Parent 1’s foster home license.\nEmails as referred to in the narrative section of this report.\nFCW/the agency provided two safety plans for Youth A, but\nneither safety plans were for marijuana use/issues.\nAllegation 2\nDHHS Worker & LW\nOn 7/19/2024 following Youth A’s onsite interview at the agency\nLW and DHHS reported information to me related to a text\n10",
    "message where FCW appeared to give Foster Parent 1 a head’s\nup about the special evaluation. They also reported concerns that\nFCW’s contact with Youth A the day of her interview may have\nbeen to coach Youth A on what to say in her interview and that\nthis contact occurred after FCW was told not have contact with\nYouth A pending the completion of the investigation. It was then\nconfirmed by Chief Administrator that FCW’s contact with Youth A\nwas prior to Youth A’s interview with us, and before FCW was\nadvised to stop her contact with Youth A.\nYouth A, Family Preservation Assistant (FPA); Foster Parent\n2\nOn 7/19/2024 DHHS Worker, LW and I interviewed Youth A, FPA\nand Foster Parent 2 onsite at the agency. Neither reported\ninformation related to this allegation. FPA reported she was not\naware of a text between FCW and Foster Parent 1 about a special\nevaluation pertaining to Foster Parent 1.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 7/19/2024 DHHS Worker, LW and I interviewed FCW onsite at\nthe agency. FCW reported she never texted Foster Parent 1 about\nthe foster parent and Youth A smoking marijuana. FCW reported\nher contacts with Foster Parent 1 were via the agency’s networks.\nShe denied using her personal phone to text Foster Parent 1\nabout such or to inform Foster Parent 1 that there was a complaint\nagainst Foster Parent 1. When the DHHS Worker advised FCW\nthere were screen shots of text messages between her and Foster\nParent 1 where she mentioned Youth A’s marijuana use with\nFoster Parent 1 and appeared to advise or coach Foster Parent 1\non what to say when interviewed, FCW acknowledged there was a\ntext message. FCW reported she was advising Foster Parent 1 of\nthe special investigation, as a way to show support not to coach or\ntell her what to say.\nIt is noteworthy, the LW reported it is not a FCW’s role to report a\nfoster home’s complaint/special evaluation allegations to the foster\nparent.\nFoster Parent 1\nOn 7/22/2024 and 7/23/2024 I interviewed Foster Parent 1 by\ntelephone. Foster Parent 1 reported when LW contacted her about\nthe complaint against her foster home, she texted FCW and told\nher LW was coming out to speak with her and Youth A. FCW told\nher the allegation was about her and Youth A smoking together.\nThat she can just let them know she and Youth A do not smoke\ntogether and that everyone knows Youth A smokes. Foster Parent\n11",
    "1 said she did not know if FCW “was really telling me what to say”\nbecause she was already going to say that, as it was the truth.\nFoster Parent 1 provided me copies of text messages between\nher and FCW.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nOn 7/24/2024 FCS was interviewed by DHHS Worker and me via\nTEAMS, with Chief Administrator present. FCS reported foster\ncare workers are not to contact foster parents about special\nevaluations. She reported that is the agency’s practice, and FCW\nis well aware that she/a worker is not to give a foster parent a\nheads up about any foster home investigation.\nDocuments Reviewed\nYouth A MISACWIS case record which showed\n• Information as indicated earlier in this section.\nText messages between Foster Parent 1 and FCW that related to\nthe foster home complaint allegations that showed:\n• Foster Parent 1 texted FCW to say she was not sure if LW\nspoke with FCW that LW was coming out to speak with\nYouth A about an allegation.\n• FCW responded to Foster Parent 1 by telling Foster Parent\n1 the allegation is about Youth A and Foster Parent 1\nsmoking marijuana together.
