    "Adoption Program Manager was interviewed face-to-face at the agency on May 23,\n2022. Adoption Program Manager stated the agency received 2 emails that she is\naware of from DHS Central Office over the past few months indicating the agency\nwas overdue with sending adoption files. The most recent email was in February.\nAdoption Program Manager stated the emails were not sent directly to her and had\nbeen forwarded to her. Adoption Program Manager stated the emails were originally\nsent to the agency’s Chief Financial Officer who had requested the Adoption\nProgram Manager be included in the emails. Adoption Program Manager stated\nthere was a delay from the time the CFO received the emails until they were\nforwarded to the Adoption Program Manager. Adoption Program Manager stated the\nagency responded to the emails and indicated the date the files were sent and did\nnot receive a response after that. Adoption Program Manager stated the 2 emails\nreferenced different files and a few of the files did not belong to their agency.\nAdoption Program Manager stated the agency will provide the files to the\nappropriate DHS office that was involved with the particular case. She stated the\nagency will either hand deliver the file or mail it depending on the distance. Adoption\nProgram Manager stated she will send an email to support staff within the agency\none year after the adoption finalization and indicate what files need to be hand\ndelivered or mailed. The support staff handles the cases involved with Kent Co DHS\nand agency adoption workers will arrange to hand deliver or mail files to other\ncounty DHS offices. Adoption Program Manager stated the agency will request\nwritten confirmation from the local DHS office when files are hand delivered.\nAdoption Program Manager was sent a follow up email on May 24, 2022, to provide\nadditional details regarding the new complaint. Youth A and Youth B’s adoption\nfinalization dates were provided to Adoption Program Manager. Adoption Program\nManager stated their agency was not involved in Youth B’s adoption. Adoption\nProgram Manager stated she would provide verification of the date Youth A’s\nadoption file was mailed to St. Clair Co. DHS.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n MISACWIS Case File: Youth A’s adoption finalization order was signed on\nOctober 20, 2020.\n MISACWIS Case File: Youth B’s adoption finalization information was\nreviewed and verified another agency had case responsibility.\n Cover sheet agency provided to St. Clair Co. DHS indicating adoption records\nare being provided per adoption policy. Sheet is signed by agency staff as\nwell as St. Clair Co DHS staff and date stamped April 25, 2022, as being\nreceived via drop box/US mail by St. Clair Co. DHS.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nADM 1030 Adoption case record retention\nFor both MDHHS and contracted adoption agency cases, the\nlocal MDHHS office or contracted agency must retain all\nadoption case records for one year after finalization of the\nadoption. One year (between 12-13 months) past the adoption\nfinalization date, a contracted adoption agency must send the\noriginal record to the local MDHHS office; copies must not be\nmaintained by the contracted adoption agency; see licensing\nrule R400.12713-Adoption Placement Record.\nANALYSIS: The agency did not send original adoption records to the local\nMDHHS office within 12-13 months after finalization of adoption\nas required. The adoption finalization of Youth A occurred on\nOctober 20, 2020, and the agency provided verification the\nadoption file was provided to St. Clair Co. DHS on April 25,\n2022.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan no change be\nmade to the license status of this child placing agency.\n____________6/10/2022__________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 13, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
