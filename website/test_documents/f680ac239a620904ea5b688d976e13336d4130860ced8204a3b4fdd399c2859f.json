Youth A was involved in a car accident in 2022 and\nhas cognitive impairment and problems with fine motor skills.\nYouth A does require help with getting dressed. Youth A’s father\npassed away, so Youth A had permission on 08/09/2023 to attend\nthe viewing and on 08/10/2023 to attend the funeral. On\n08/09/2023 CA helped Youth A get ready and the mother picked\nup Youth A for the viewing. Youth A was picked up by her mother\nat 2:30 pm and was supposed be returned at 7:00 pm.

Youth A said the search happened in her bedroom\nand there was another staff present, but she could not recall which\nstaff was present. Youth A again said the search occurred after\nshe returned from the viewing and not the funeral.

A\nroom search was completed by Staff 4, while Youth A was at her\nfather’s funeral. There was nothing found in the bedroom. Staff 1\ndenied directing or witnessing any staff strip search Youth A. The\nfacility policy is when youths go in the community is to search\nbags or purses. She has worked in residentials for several years\n3",
    "and would never strip search or direct staff to strip search a youth.\nStaff 4 was never alone in Youth A’s bedroom on 08/10/2023.\nWhen Youth A returned from the funeral on 08/10/2023, Youth A\nwent to her bedroom with her mother and her mother assisted\nYouth A with changing her clothes.\nI interviewed Staff 2 via telephone on 08/25/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist.

Staff 4 report\nshe has been working at the facility for six months. She recalled\non 08/09/2023 she was not assigned to Youth A, but on\n08/10/2023 she was assigned to Youth A. Staff 4 denied strip\nsearching or having any contact with Youth A in her bedroom on\n08/09/2023. She said on 08/10/2023, while Youth A was at her\nfather’s funeral it was mentioned that Youth A may have bought\nweed the day before, so she was instructed to complete a room\nsearch. Staff 4 completed a room search and didn’t find anything.\nYouth A returned from the funeral around 7:30 pm, Youth A and\nher mother went to the bedroom, she and Staff 1 followed them,\nYouth A's mother helped Youth A change her clothes, after Youth\nA went to the living room to watch television.

Staff 4 said she is aware of the agency search policy\nand would never strip search any youth.\nA predisposition conference held with MDHHS Specialist on\n09/12/2023. There is no finding by MDHHS Specialist.\n4",
    "Documents Reviewed:\n• Room Search policy and procedures. Participants rooms\nmay be searched for items that are dangerous to the\nparticipants or others (alcohol, drugs, and sharp objects).\n• Staff 4 has no disciplinary actions in her employee file.\n• Youth A’s treatment plan. Youth A is on general\nsupervision, requires help with grip and pinch, fine motor\ncoordination, and deficit awareness along with her ability to\nindependently complete basic and instrumental activities of\ndaily living.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is insufficient\nevidence that staff stripped searched and inappropriately touched\nyouth based on interviews with Staff and Youth. Youth A’s\ninterview was inconsistent with who and when she was searched,\nso it could be determined that was striped searched.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nSeptember 18, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 18, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
