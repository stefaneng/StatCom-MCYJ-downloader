Foster Child B and Foster Child C were then placed",
    "with Parent D and Parent E from 08/26/2019 to 12/09/2019. The two children were\nthen removed on 12/09/2019 and placed with Foster parent F.\nThe MiSACWIS (Michigan Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System)\nentry for a social work contact on 12/10/2019 read as follows (names coded):\nRemoval hearing took place, however, (Parent E) had not attended the hearing\neven though she was provided notice of the hearing the night prior. (Parent E)\ncompleted a random drug screen with (Court Worker 6) that morning which\ntested positive. (Parent E) then left the courthouse and didn't stay for the removal\nhearing. (Parent D) told the court that he thought that he caught his relapse early\nenough and he greatly downplayed his issues. Judge ordered visitations to\ncontinue to take place as long as supervised. Parenting time is not contingent\nupon a clean drug screen. Prior to the removal hearing, (Relative A) and (Parent\nD) spoke to this worker. (Relative A) now told this worker that he had spoken to\nhis work and the girls’ daycare and both places are able to work with him in order\nfor him to be able to take the girls. Worker expressed to (Relative A) that she\nhad concerns about him being able to care for the girls as this weekend he had\nsaid that he couldn't care for them. (Relative A) then told worker that he could\ncare for the girls and then (Relative A) asked if (Parent E) would be able to help\nhim. This worker stated that \"no\" (Parent E) couldn't help him with the girls as\nshe has an open case and her parenting time is supervised and if he were to\ntake the girls he would have to meet all of their needs. (Relative A) looked\ndisappointment that (Parent E) wouldn't be able to help him but then said that he\nwould still like his home to be looked at. Worker told him that a licensing worker\nwould be in contact with him.\nFoster Care Worker 1 was contacted by telephone on 02/24/2020. She said that she\nreturns calls from Relative A “all the time”. She said that there are some days with\nmultiple messages from Relative A. Foster Care Worker 1 said that Relative A told her\nhe could not take Foster Child B and Foster Child C when he was asked at the time of\nthe second removal from the parents home. Foster Care Worker 1 said that Relative A\nhad to check with his work and arrange daycare for the girls. Foster Care Worker 1 said\nthat now there are concerns with placing Foster Child B and Foster Child C with him\nbecause he is growing marijuana in his home and Relative A had a Wisconsin criminal\nconviction involving growing marijuana that he did not disclose to the agency.\nI received that following email from Supervisor 3 written by Licensing Worker 5 on\n02/24/2020:\nI was asked to complete the 3130A for (Relative A) the week of December 9th. I\ncalled and scheduled an initial meeting with him for Tuesday, December 17th,\nhowever was it was cancelled as I was out sick on that day. I was on vacation\nthe week of Christmas, so contacted him when I got back after New Year’s and\nrescheduled for January 6th, which was when we met for the first time. During\nthat visit there were licensing/safety concerns that Relative A needed to fix, so he",
    "was asked to contact me when they were done for me to come back to the\nhouse. I had a death in my family that week and ended up scheduling with him\nfor January 20th. At that visit, the safety concerns/licensing rules were still not\ncompleted, so I scheduled to come back the following week. I completed another\nhome visit on January 27th, at which time the changes had still not been made to\nthe home, and I provided (Relative A) with the information regarding the\nrecommendation for denial. He was told at that time that he could contact me\nagain to be reassessed, should he decide to make the necessary safety changes\nto his home. I received a phone call from (Relative A) on February 6th, and he\nasked me to come back out to assess his home. However, during the discussion\nwith him it became clear that he had not made any changes to his home at this\npoint and that his son (who is the father to the granddaughters he is seeking\nplacement of) moved into his home following his release from jail. (Relative A)\nwas notified that the changes to the home needed to be done, and his son\nneeded to have an alternative living arrangement before I came back for another\nassessment. I have not heard from him since that time.\nFoster Care Worker 1 was interviewed for a second time by telephone on 02/24/2020.\nShe that children were at either a neighbor or family of Parent E, she could not\nremember which one, and then moved to the maternal grandmother. The grandmother\nsaid she could not care for the children, according to Foster Care Worker 1 and the\nchildren were placed in foster care by Foster Care Worker 1. She said that after three\ndays the children were moved to another foster home, Foster parent G. Foster Care\nWorker 1 said that at the time of removal Relative A was unable to take placement of\nFoster Child B and Foster Child C in August 2018. As stated above the children where\nreturn to Parent D who was no longer with Parent E. Foster Care Worker 1 said there\nwere no other relatives who showed interest in the placement of these children. Foster\nCare Worker 1 said the case was originally the case of Foster Care Worker 9. Foster\nCare Worker 1 said that Foster Care Worker 9 started evaluations of Relative A. Foster\nCare Worker 9 left the agency.\nIn MiSACWIS records dated 08/20/2018 Relative A declined placement of Foster Child\nB and Foster Child C due to health. The DHS-987 Relative Documentation was\ncompleted by Dickinson County DHHS. Relative A returned a DHS-990, Relative\nResponse checking the boxes by both temporary and permanent placement of Foster\nChild B and Foster Child C.\nLicensing Worker 5 wrote the following narrative which was emailed to me by\nSupervisor 3 on 02/14/2020. Licensing Worker 5 wrote in her narrative that there were\nissues with Relative A becoming approved for Foster Child B and Foster Child C. She\nwrote that there were two grow rooms in the house for growing marijuana and she had\ncounted 13 plants and the law allows 12. She asked Relative A for a safety plan when\nhe was under the influence of marijuana and he was not cooperative with developing a\nsafety plan. Licensing Worker 5 wrote that there was a problem with the upstairs\nbedroom that Relative A proposed that Foster Child B and Foster Child C were to sleep\nin. She wrote that the stairway was very narrow, and the bedroom door did not latch.",
    "There was also a very low ceiling above the stairway. Relative A was not truthful\nregarding a felony marijuana conviction in Wisconsin in 1998. Licensing Worker 5 also\nwrote the Relative A’s home smelled of tobacco and marijuana smoke. Licensing\nWorker 5 wrote that she felt that Relative A would not protect the children from their\nbiological parents.\nRelative A called me back on 02/25/2020. We talked for a short time and I attempted to\narrange a call back time and Relative A said he would call back on 02/26/2020. Relative\nA said he would call back and did not want me to call him. There was no substance to\nthe conversation with Relative A. As of 03/01/2020 I have not heard back from Relative\nA.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12404 Placement.\n(4) An agency shall consider all of the following factors in\nselecting an appropriate placement for a child:\n(e) The continuity of relationships, including relationships\nwith parents, siblings, relatives, foster parents, previous foster\nparents, and other persons significant to the child.\nANALYSIS: Upper Peninsula Family Solutions considered Relative A for\nplacement of Foster Child A and Foster Child B.
