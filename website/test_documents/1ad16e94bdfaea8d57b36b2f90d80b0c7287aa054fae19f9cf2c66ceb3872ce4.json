EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 11 acceptable corrective action plans (CAPs) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nfirst was a result of non-compliance at the time of renewal after the first six month\nprovisional license after the issuance of the original license. This CAP contained\n21 rule violations and resulted in 13 action steps. Full compliance was not\nachieved as there are repeated rule violations in this inspection. Compliance was\nachieved in areas of documentation within youth files. In addition, there were ten\nspecial investigations that had violations causing the need for CAPs, listed below:\n• SIR # 2024C0001049SI produced violations related to CCI Rule 400.4142\n(1) (e) and 400.4104 (2). The resulting action items related to updating\npolicy & procedure to ensure the health needs of children at the facility\nwere met, as well as providing updated policies & procedures to Licensing\nfor review.\n• SIR # 2024C0000927SI produced violations related to CCI Rule 400.4158\n(1) (a) (ii). The resulting action items included updates to policy &\nprocedure to further clarify the non-use of physical management by staff at\nthe facility.\n• SIR # 2024C0000953SI produced a violation related to CCI Rule 400.4126\n(1). The resulting action items included updated policies and procedures\nregarding supervision of youth.\n• SIR # 2024SIC0001223 produced a violation related to CCI Rule 400.4124\n(1). The resulting action items included updated policies and procedures\nregarding appropriate and allowable communication between youth and\nfamily members, caseworkers, and mental health providers.",
    "• SIR # 2024C0001037SI produced violations related to CCI Rule 400.4158\n(1) (a) (ii), 400.4127 (4), 400.4109 (1) (c), 400.4158 (1) (a) (iv), and\n400.4116 (1). This special investigation resulted in the issuance of a first\nprovisional license. The resulting action items included updates to policies\n& procedures regarding physical contact between staff and youth, safety\nchecks of youth during sleeping hours and the supervision of the Chief\nAdministrator role, as well as further training for staff regarding de-\nescalation techniques, verbal abuse of youth, and safe driving standards.\n• SIR # 2024SIC0001210 produced a violation related to CCI Rule 400.4142\n(1) (d). The resulting action item included changes in policy and\nprocedures for the storage and access of medications.\n• SIR # 2024C0001159SI produced a violation related to CCI Rule 400.4126\n(1). The resulting action items included changes to facility practices of the\nsupervision of youth.\n• SIR # 2024SIC0001172 produced a violation related to CCI Rule 400.4142\n(1) (a). The resulting action items included changes to policy & procedure\nregarding the provision of information on youth placed to medical\nproviders.\n• SIR # 2024C0001091SI produced a violation related to Act 116 Rule\n722.120 and CCI Rule 400.4130 (1). The resulting action items included\ntraining for staff on how to speak with youth who are a part of any\ninvestigations as well as updates to policy & procedure regarding the\nrecording of youth and the facility’s security camera system.\n• SIR # 2024SIC0001241 produced a violation related to CCI Rule 400.4130\n(1). The resulting action items included updates to policy & procedures\nregarding the necessary confidentiality of youth.\nMuch of the compliance for these CAPs could not be achieved because the\nfacility had its contract ended for its sole referral source in June of 2024, ending\nany further placements since that time. The facility is expected to meet CAP\naction items upon new placements with the new approved referral source.\nCompliance was achieved in areas of updating policies and procedures to ensure\ncompliance with licensing rules, further de-escalation and behavior management\ntraining and scheduling of staff to maintain ratio requirements.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility did not provide an independent financial audit for the year, resulting in\na rule violation. Budgeting information was provided. Clarification was needed as\nthe initial information provided allocated for the next calendar year to include\nincome from MDHHS placements, which is not currently contracted. Budgeting\nalso showed planned income from the currently approved referral source to be\nhigher than previously documented.",
    "PREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator provided an assessment dated 12/02/2024. This\nassessment expressed barriers to rule compliance as staff turnover, a lack of\nsupport from Licensing, challenges in managing the behavior issues of placed\nyouth and ineffective leadership at the time of original licensure. The Chief\nAdministrator assessed the facility is in compliance with Licensing rules and\nprevious deficiencies have been resolved.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff were interviewed over the phone during this inspection. They expressed\nexcitement about the new referral source and the program having possible\nplacements in the near future and discussed recent staff meetings and trainings in\nadvance of this new programming.\nNo youth were interviewed for this inspection because the facility has not had any\nnew placements.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe facility was toured on 12/12/2024 during an unannounced, face-to-face visit.\nNo concerns were noted. Despite not having recent placements the property was\nclean and well maintained, as well as properly stocked with food, cleaning\nsupplies and other items for possible future placements.",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all pplicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency license be modified to a Second Provisional license.\n01/13/2025\n___________________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n1/13/2025\n___________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
