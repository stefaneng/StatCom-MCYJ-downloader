    "ALLEGATION:\nAgency staff member has not provided facility with required 1643 for psychotropic\nmedication since the youth’s admission even after multiple requests were made.\nThere are concerns regarding the youth’s medications that need to be addressed\nand at this time, there is no informed consent to adjust or dispense medication.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 12/14/2020 I reviewed Youth A’s case file in MiSACWIS which showed that he\nentered foster care on 10/22/2020 and was prescribed three psychotropic\nmedications on 11/2/2020. Youth A was placed in a residential facility on\n11/30/2020. There was no informed consent located in the file and the only social\nwork contacts located in which informed consent was discussed was a contact\nbetween Foster Care Worker 1 and her supervisor on 12/14/2020, the same day this\ncomplaint was received, during which they discussed requesting court approval for\nthe medications.\nOn 12/22/2020 I spoke with Foster Care Worker 1 by phone. She reported that she\nmade an attempt to get the youth’s father to sign the informed consent at some\npoint, but he signed it on the wrong line. She stated that she reached out to him\n“multiple times” to get his consent and that he consented over text, but he did not\nsign the form. She reported that she also reached out to the prescribing physician\nbut has not gotten any response. She stated that, when Youth A was brought to a\nresidential facility on 11/30/2020, she did not provide them with informed consent. I\nasked her if she asked the father to sign the form during any of her face to face\ncontacts with him and she stated that she did not have the form with her to do so.\nShe reported that the father was in quarantine related to Covid-19 from the middle of\nNovember until the end of November, so she did not have physical contact with him\nduring that time. She stated that she did pursue a court order for the medication the\nprevious week. When I told her I could not find any of her attempts to obtain written\nconsent in the file, she stated that she entered all of these contacts in the file late\nlast week, after finding out about the investigation.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 802-1 PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN FOSTER CARE\nConsent is required for the prescription and use of all\npsychotropic medications for all children in foster care and\nfor children placed for adoption where the court has not\nissued an order finalizing the adoption.\nDocumentation\nThe DHS-1643, Psychotropic Medication Informed Consent,\nor the prescribing clinician's alternative consent form that\ncontains all the required elements of the DHS-1643 as\ndetermined by the FC-PMOU, must be used to document\nthis discussion between the prescribing clinician and the\nconsenting party.\nANALYSIS: Foster Care Worker 1 admitted Youth A to a residential program\nwithout providing or having obtained informed consent for his\nprescribed psychotropic medication.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend no change to the license of this private child caring institution, upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan.\nDecember 29, 2020\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 29, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
