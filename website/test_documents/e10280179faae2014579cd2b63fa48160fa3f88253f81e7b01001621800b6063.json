INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 2/9/23 Staff 1 slammed Youth E to the floor. On 2/7/23, Staff 2\npunched Youth S in the ribs in his room. Neither youth was\ninjured as a result.\nInvestigation On 2/10/23 I notified Youth E’s and S’s foster care workers of this\ninvestigation assignment. Neither worker expressed additional\nconcerns regarding the facility.\nResidential Director (RD) said she notified facility supervisors Staff\n1 cannot be alone with Youth E and Staff 2 cannot be alone with\nYouth S pending the outcome of this investigation.\n2",
    "There are no incident reports and no video footage for the alleged\nincidents as there are no cameras in the youth bedrooms.\nI interviewed Residential Director (RD) who is also the\nComplainant, jointly with Government Worker 1. She said Youth\nE told her Staff 1 slammed him to his bedroom floor on 2/9/23 and\ndenied being injured as a result when they spoke.\nI interviewed Youth E jointly with Government Worker 1 at school\non 2/13/23. He said on 2/09/23 or 2/10/23 at 5am, Staff 1 told him\nto get up, smacked his face, yanked his foot, and pulled his whole\nbody off the bed onto the floor. His right elbow hit the floor\ncausing pain. Youth E said no one else witnessed this.\nAs previously indicated, Youth E denied any injuries when\nreporting this to RD. Today, on 2/13/23, he explained he\npreviously injured the same elbow on his own, but never told the\nresidential staff about it. Youth E claimed the incident with Staff 1\non 2/9/23 exacerbated a previous elbow injury and that his elbow\nstill hurts. Government Worker 1 and I observed Youth E’s right\nelbow and there were no visible marks. However, asked to flex\nand raise his right arm, Youth E complained of pain. I informed\nRD that Youth E is experiencing pain in his right elbow and asked\nthat he be examined by a medical professional as soon as\npossible.\nMedical documentation from West Park Urgent Care dated\n2/14/23 indicated Youth E was examined and x-rayed with no\nevidence of joint effusion or abnormality.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has\nworked at the facility for two years. Staff 1 said Youth E has\ndifficulty getting out of bed for school on most days. When he\nwalks through the hall calling for the youths to get up, he said\nYouth E usually whines and resists. Staff 1 was unable to recall\nexactly how Youth E got out of bed on 2/9/23. “I may have started\ntaking his covers off. I’m pretty sure I tapped him on the\nshoulder.” Staff 1 admitted sometimes “grabbing his arm and\nhelping him up.” If he still does not get up, “I lecture him (about\nthe consequence which is three days of early bed) or let a\nsupervisor deal with him.” Staff 1 denied ever smacking the\nyouth’s face, pulling his foot, or pulling his body onto the floor.\nA review of Staff 1’s employee file showed disciplinary write-ups\nfor attendance only.\n3",
    "I asked RD for more details about the alleged incident between\nYouth S and Staff 2. She said Youth S told her Staff 2 punched\nhim in his ribs in his room on 2/7/23 around 6pm, after Youth S\nthrew a plastic fork at Staff 2.\nI attempted to interview Youth S jointly with Government Worker 1\nat school. School personnel requested his presence twice and\nboth times, he refused to be interviewed. Youth S reportedly told\nthe Vice Principal he knew what we (Government Worker 1 and I)\nwere there for and refused to talk with us.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has\nworked at the facility for three years. On 2/7/23, Staff 2 said\nYouth S was disrupting the group and the supervisor asked him to\ntake the youth upstairs (to his room.) “I told him to sit on his bed\nand I sat in the hallway…His dinner was brought upstairs. Youth\nS said ‘F’ me and he would kill me. He threw a plastic fork with\none prong on the floor…For thirty minutes, he kicked and punched\nthe wall, tossed the fork, was cussing and saying, ‘Staff do too\nmuch.’”\nAsked why Youth S was angry, Staff 2 responded, “I don’t know.”\nAsked about his relationship with Youth S, he said “We get along.\nOn 2/8/23 after school, he gave me a (plastic) bracelet.”\nA review of Staff 2’s employee file showed disciplinary write-ups\nfor horseplay and using inappropriate language.\nOn 2/27/23, Youth T told Government Worker 1 that Staff 1\nyanked him off his bed by his leg one morning to get him up. I\nconducted a follow-up interview of Staff 1 jointly with Government\nWorker 1 via telephone on 3/3/23. Again Staff 1 denied yanking\nor pulling youth or threatening to physically get them out of bed.\nHe reiterated, “I pat them on the back and pull their covers off.” If\nthe youth refuse, Staff 1 said he warns them he will report their\nbehavior and they could receive consequences such as limited\nactivities or an early bedtime.\nAnalysis There is no evidence Staff 1 pulled or slammed Youth E from his\nbed onto the floor on 2/9/23 and Youth E did not complain of injury\nupon initial report. However, four days later, Youth E complained\nto investigators of elbow pain resulting from the alleged incident.\nA medical examination and x-rays on 2/14/23 showed no joint\neffusion or abnormality.\n4",
    "There is no evidence Staff 1 yanked Youth T off his bed by the\nleg. There is also no evidence Staff 2 punched Youth S in the ribs\nin his room on 2/7/23. There were no witnesses to this alleged\nevent and no injuries.\nCONSULTATION\nStaff 1 admitted he sometimes uses interventions such as\nremoving the youths’ blankets and/or taking a youth’s arm to help\nhim get up out of bed in the morning for school. I recommend the\nfacility develop a special behavior plan for Youth E with regard to\ngetting out of bed that includes acceptable interventions to handle\nresistance. Additionally, I recommend the facility identify\nacceptable and prohibited interventions when encouraging youth\nto get up for school. It is notable that the agency was previously\nprovided Technical Assistance in Special Investigation\n2022C0207001 related, in part, to waking youth up in the morning\nand included a reminder to staff to take care when physically\ninteracting with youth in any manner.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is compliant with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be continued.\nMarch 7, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 28, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n5"
