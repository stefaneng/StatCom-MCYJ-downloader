IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\nLicense #: CI410305582\nLicensee Name: DA Blodgett for Children\nLicensee Address: 805 Leonard NE\nGrand Rapids, MI 49503\nLicensee Telephone #:\nAdministrator/Licensee Designee: Sharon Loughridge, Administrator\nName of Facility: St. John's Home Residential\nFacility Address: 2355 Knapp St.\nGrand Rapids, MI 49505\nFacility Telephone #: (616) 361-5227\nCapacity: 56\nProgram Type: CHILD CARING INSTITUTION, PRIVATE\n1",
    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nSt. Johns Home Residential Program is requesting to convert the Ryan and Clancy\nhomes to co-educational programming (both genders). Program leadership staff\nbelieve that service delivery will be more efficient if these two programs are merged\nand function as one program/treatment team. It is also believed that co-ed\nprogramming offers a more “real life” perspective for the residents than the current\nsingle gender model.\nIII. Methodology\nThis consultant conducted an on-site inspection of the facilities and interviewed\nleadership staff. The program statement and all relevant policies and procedures\nwere reviewed and consultation was offered to leadership staff. St. Johns Home\nResidential Program leadership staff provided written and verbal rationale for this\nchange to the terms of the license.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nSt. Johns Home Residential program is in substantial compliance with all relevant\nadministrative and statutory requirements for child caring institutions. The current\npolicies and procedures regarding client supervision and service provision have\nbeen modified and are appropriate for a co-ed treatment setting. All appropriate\nsafety measures, including surveillance video cameras, have been put in place. Staff\nwill be moved between these two programs to insure adequate gender staffing in\nboth programs. Program therapists will begin co-facilitating co-ed life skills groups.\nAdditional staff training regarding co-educational treatment programming has been\nand will be provided in the near future. Referral sources were informed of this\npossible change and input was solicited and implemented in the planning phase.\nV. Recommendation\nThis consultant recommends amending the terms of this license to accommodate\nboth genders in the Ryan and Clancy Homes.\n__________________________\nVernon Oard Date: August 22, 2011\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n__________________________\nDeborah Clark Date: September 9, 2011\nArea Manager\n2"
