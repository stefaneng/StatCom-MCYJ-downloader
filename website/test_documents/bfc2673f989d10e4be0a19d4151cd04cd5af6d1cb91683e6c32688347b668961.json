She recalled the incident starting in the pod where Youth\nA was arguing with Youth B and Youth C, and Staff 1 has not\nbeen able to verbally de-escalate Youth A. Youth A had a\nbroomstick in his hand because he was in the process of cleaning\nup papers he had ripped up and thrown all over the floor of the\npod. He proceeded to throw the broomstick at Youth B. Staff 1\nrecalled Youth B charged at Youth A and it appeared to her he\nintended to fight. Staff 1 stated she tried to restrain Youth B from\ngetting to Youth A. She stated Youth B, and then Youth C, were\nable to get to Youth A and physically assault Youth A despite her\nefforts to stop it. As this occurred Staff 1 called a “code red”,\nwhich alerted senior staff to come to the pod to assist in de-\nescalating the situation. Staff 1 could not recall the exact details\nof Youth B and Youth C assaulting Youth A, other than to state\nshe was trying to stop them and was unsuccessful. Staff 1\nrecalled Youth A eventually being on the floor near the entrance of\nthe showers, curled up in a ball as Youth C tried to kick him. Staff\n1 recalled both Youth B and Youth C immediately stopped as\nother staff came in to the pod to assist. Staff 1 stated she knew\nthe assault on Youth A was bad, and also believed she could have\ntried to restrain Youth A to prevent the situation from escalating\n2",
    "but was not confident in doing so because of the physical threat\nposed by Youth B and Youth C.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 11/20/2024 with DHHS Worker 1 and\nDHHS Worker 2 during an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the\nfacility.

This quickly escalated to punches being thrown\nbetween Youth A and Youth B. Staff 2 recalled seeing Youth B hit\nYouth A as she tried to intervene between them. She believed\nYouth B was able to pick up Youth A and slam him on a\ntable. Staff 2 recalled Youth A making his way towards the\nentrance of the showers, only for Youth C to continue to assault\nhim there. This occurred after Youth A threw something at Youth\nC, but Staff 2 could not recall what that was. Staff 2 recalled\ntrying to shield Youth A, who was on the ground, from Youth C but\nwas unsuccessful in doing so. Youth C kicked and hit Youth A\nwhile Youth A was on the ground.

He recalled\nseeing Youth A laying on the ground near the entrance of the\nshowers. At that time Youth C was standing over Youth A, and\nStaff 5 recalled restraining Youth C to get him away from Youth\nA.

Youth A recalled throwing\nsomething at Youth C, and Youth C then charged him. Youth A\nstated he remembered what happened next but because it\noccurred so fast, he was not sure if Youth C punched or kicked\nhim. Youth A was on the ground at that point, and he recalled one\nof the female staff standing over him trying to protect him from\nYouth C. Youth A remembered the incident ending quickly, and\nhe didn’t see Youth B or Youth C after that point. Staff helped him\nup and he believed he was immediately taken to the nurse. Youth\nA commented he was not with the nurse long before it was\ndecided he be taken to the hospital for further medical\nattention. Youth A remarked that, while he could not recall which\nstaff were in the pod with him, they were trying to de-escalate the\nsituation and trying to protect him from Youth B and Youth\nC. Youth A did not believe the incident occurred because staff did\nnot act quickly enough or were not present.
