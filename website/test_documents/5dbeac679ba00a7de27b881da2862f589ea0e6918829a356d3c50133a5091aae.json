This\noccurred at Vista sometime in 2024, but she stated Youth A was\nat the agency for three more months after this occurred, and the\nstaff member involved who did this was Supervisor 1. She\nexplained she was in her room watching TV when Supervisor 1\ntold Youth A to come into the staff bathroom, which is located on\nthe other side of the hall and is not a bathroom Youth A usually\ngoes to.

    "against the wall and pulled Youth A’s arm to her throat. Youth A\nstated she was standing, and her legs were spread apart.

Youth A\nstated she did not share a bedroom with another youth, and no\none saw her leave to go into the staff bathroom. Youth A stated\nthis was the first time something like this happened and it did not\nhappen again.

She stated after the incident,\nshe walked back to her bedroom by herself.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via phone on 8/12/2025. She\nreported knowing about the allegations but strongly denied them.\nShe reported not understanding why Youth A would choose\nSupervisor 1 to make allegations against since Supervisor 1\nreported they had a good relationship when Youth A was at the\nfacility.

Youth A took\nSupervisor 1’s verbal redirection and even asked Supervisor 1 to\n6",
    "visit Youth A in Youth A’s new placement (Supervisor 1 never did\nvisit Youth A in the new placement). Supervisor 1 reported never\nbeing in a bathroom with Youth A or any other youth because staff\nshould not be in the bathroom with a youth nor behind a closed\ndoor with youth. Supervisor 1 reported staff will support her denial\nbecause it never happened. When asked why she left the facility,\nSupervisor 1 reported because of all the investigations it became\na horrible place to work, and she was tired of being attacked by\nthe youth.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n11 Incident reports for Youth A:\n• 6/16/24-Suicide Assessment.

There were 2 incidents where Youth A\nthreatened to get staff fired and 2 incidents when Youth A\nattacked several staff, engaged in self-harming behaviors\nand Law Enforcement was called because of Youth A’s\nviolent behaviors.\nCase Report Dearborn Heights PD CR No: 250017670 dated\n7/2/2025. This document outlines Law Enforcement’s investigation\ninto the charge of CSC 1st Degree with Supervisor 1. The report\nidentifies several inconsistencies in Youth A’s report of the\nallegations involving Youth A’s location when the alleged incident\nbegan (reported watching TV in her room but there are no TV’s in\nbedrooms, watching TV with others which changed to sitting alone\nin her room reading). The report also documents Youth A gave\nvery vague answers and was not forthcoming. It is documented\nthat Supervisor 1 reported a “great” relationship with Youth A and\nSupervisor 1 was the staff called when Youth A became\ndysregulated (physically and mentally abusive towards staff). It is\ndocumented that Supervisor 1 believes the allegations are a result\nof Youth A feeling abandoned because Supervisor 1 did not visit\nYouth A at her new placement. Supervisor 1 denied the\nallegations and stated never taking a youth to the bathroom\nbecause the line staff would be responsible for that action if\nneeded.\nHR file for Supervisor 1 was reviewed. Documentation indicates\nSupervisor 1 was hired on 7/5/23 and there are two disciplinary\nactions documented in the file. The first disciplinary action (verbal\nwarning) occurred on 4/1/24 and was the result of a policy\n8",
    "violation in regard to safety and supervision of clients. She\nallowed clients to have items that were deemed contraband after\nsafety plans were communicated to all staff. The second is\ndocumented as a written warning on 7/18/24 and involved\nSupervisor 1 sending an email regarding a meeting after\nSupervisor 1 was advised by Director that Director was going to\nsend out the email. Supervisor 1 was found to have sent the email\nout to various employees. Documentation in the HR file indicates\nSupervisor 1 quit employment on 11/25/24 after calling Human\nResources and informing them that she was “done”. Supervisor 1\nis documented as taking her belongings and leaving the unit.\nDocumentation in the HR file also confirms Supervisor 1 was\ncurrent on her required trainings.\nVista Maria Residential Program Policy Client Observation\nPOL-005-020 dated 3/2016. This document is to ensure the\nsafety of all youth. The levels of observation are outlined with High\nLevel being described as 100% observation. If a youth is placed\non this level the staff must remain with the youth at all times and\ndocument the youth’s behaviors and actions every 15-minutes.\nStaff are not to leave the youth without replacement staff available\nto provide uninterrupted observation. It is documented that youth\non 100% observation must have the observing staff sit in the\nbathroom while the youth is meeting their personal needs.\nVista Maria Residential Program Policy Employee Behavior\n022-114 dated 5/2021. This document outlines guiding principles\nof acceptable and unacceptable employee behavior. Staff are\nexpected to conduct themselves in a positive, professional, and\nrespectful manner at all times. Prohibited behaviors are\ndocumented and include, “engaging in any form of sexual or other\nforms of harassing or bullying behavior”.\nWalk-through:\nA walk-through was completed at the facility. The facility is an\nolder building that has evidence of being in the process of having\nrepairs to the walls. They have plywood covering holes in the\nwalls until the scheduled repairs can be completed. Administrator\n1 reported repairs have been scheduled. The facility is furnished\nappropriately, especially in the bedroom areas and the plumbing is\nin working order.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as evidenced by interviews with\nstaff, youth, and documentation reviews. There is no witnesses,\nand all staff and additional youth interviewed did not give any\nevidence of supporting the allegations. All youth interviewed\n9",
    "denied ever observing Supervisor 1 in a bathroom alone with\nYouth A. It should be noted that Youth A had changed the\nallegations from the initial of daily sexual abuse to only once\nduring the CAC interview and the Law Enforcement investigation\ndocuments inconsistencies in Youth A report. Given Youth A’s\nhistory of violence it appears doubtful that Youth A would accept\nbeing intimidated by Supervisor 1.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical Assistance was provided in respect to ensuring staff\nunderstand the importance of making sure they are not alone with\nyouth and have a secondary staff present. Staff should never be in\nthe youth’s bedroom or bathroom without the second staff for\nsupport and staff should stay within camera view as much as\npossible.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n9/3/2025\n______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n9/9/2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n10"
