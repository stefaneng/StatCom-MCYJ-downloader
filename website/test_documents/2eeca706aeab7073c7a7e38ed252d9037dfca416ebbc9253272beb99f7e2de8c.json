A waiver must be accompanied by a certification\nby the local health department that the parent or parents\nreceived education on the risks of not receiving the\nvaccines being waived and the benefits of vaccination to\nthe individual and the community as required by section\n5111 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL\n333.5111, and R 325.176(12).\nTwo of six open foster child records reviewed showed that three to four of the\nrespective child's immunizations had expired, and the record did not show\ndocumentation of a parental waiver.\nRepeat Violation Established:\n2024 Renewal, CAP approved 5/10/2024.\nCPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and family time; in person contact.\n3",
    "(4) An agency shall facilitate in-person contact between\nsiblings who are not placed together except when there\nis a court determination that contact is detrimental to\neither child.\nOne of six open foster child records reviewed did not show documentation of an\nApril 2024, July 2024, or February 2025 sibling visit.\nRepeat Violation Established:\n2024 Renewal, CAP approved 5/10/2024.\nCPA Rule 400.12605 Adoptive family evaluation.\n(1) An agency social service worker shall complete a\nwritten adoptive evaluation within 90 days of the family\nsigning an adoption application and prior to approving a\nfamily for adoption.\nFour of six adoptive family evaluations reviewed showed the family's evaluation was\nnot completed within 90 days of the family's application date, as required by the\nrule.\nRepeat Violation Established:\n2023 Interim, CAP approved 7/12/2023.\nCPA Rule 400.12607 Agency recommendation.\n(4) An agency shall provide the applicants for adoption\nwith a signed and dated copy of the evaluation and\nrecommendation upon its completion.\nThree of six adoptive family records reviewed did not show documentation that the\nfamily received a copy of their respective February 2025 and March 2025 adoption\nevaluations.\nIV.

CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n4",
    "No consultation was requested or required during this inspection.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nDuring this licensing inspection period the agency submitted two acceptable\ncorrective action plans.\nThe first corrective action plan related to Special Investigation 2024SIC000119\nwere the intake was received on 2/26/2024. The complaint alleged an employee\nviolated confidentiality. During the special investigation the evidence supported\nthe allegations, and the agency was found in violation of R400.12211 for Privacy\nsafeguard. The agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan that was\napproved on 9/24/2024. The agency has implemented this corrective plan.\nThe second corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024 Renewal\ninspection where the agency was found in violation of 8 rule violations. During this\n2025 Interim inspection 3 violations were repeat violations from 2024, and 1 is a\nrepeat violation from 2023. The agency’s corrective action plan compliance\naround these 4 rule violations is as follows: the number of individual cases cited\nremained the same with respect to 2 citations, deceased on 1 citation and\nincreased on the remaining 1 repeat violation from 2023 that went from 1 of 5 to 3\nof 6. The agency contributed the latter increase to poor documentation, which it\nreports it continues to work on.\nA review of the agency’s 2024 Renewal corrective action plan showed completed\nand/or implemented all aspects of the corrective plan, though that implementation\ndid not result in complete compliance of all licensing rules during this inspection.\nFurther corrective action planning is required to achieve compliance and the\nagency indicated it will continue striving for full compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s (CA) report dated 4/1/2025. The CA\nreport indicated various areas it has achieved full or partial compliances in, such\nas adoption assessments and adoption quarterlies related to the former and\ntreatment plans and dental policy related to the latter. It also indicated barriers\nwhich impacted full compliance. Barriers indicated were workers and supervisors\nnot consistently ultilizing departmental checklists to cross reference items; workers\nfailing to consistently reference the Book of Business and Data Warehouse\nsystem; or not following policy guidelines. The CA report indicated the corrective\naction plan brought attention to areas that more attention and oversight was\nneeded and provided supervisors with guidelines to improve and provide workers\n5",
    "with a check and balance system to aid them in meeting metric numbers. The\nchief administrator reported that the agency’s’ goal is to strive for total compliance\nfor the next year.\nThe chief administrator identified the agency’s strengths as team work, ability to\ncommunicate and problem solve; and that it was able to gain attention this year\nvia a local new station to bring attention to what the agency does. Challenges\nindicated by the chief administrator were staff turnover, case close outs not\noccurring timely due to orders not being uploaded from other entities, Wayne\nCounty adoption timeframes for signing orders, parent cancelling visits,\nmedical/dental offices not being able to re-schedule visits until after the due date,\nand not enough foster homes for replacements. All of these are areas the agency\nmust continue to focus on and develop interpersonal communications and put\nforth collaborative work efforts.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a 2025 annual foster care and adoption budget; as well as\na copy of its 9/30/2024 independent financial audit. A review of these documents\ndid not show indications of any notable areas of concern.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, the licensing supervisor\nand adoption supervisor, I interviewed one foster care worker, one licensing\nworker and one adoption worker. All the staff reported positives about the agency,\nthe managerial staff, and indicated feeling supportive and respected. All these\nstaff reported that everyone helps one another, there is good team\ncommunication, overall good agency communication; and that the agency is a\nworthwhile place to work. An area of growth reported related to gaining greater\nstaff retention.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nDuring a tour of the agency's facility, I did not observe any safety issues or\nconcerns. The agency has sufficient space and equipment for its employees, and\nfiles are securely stored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts during this inspection period.\n6",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMay 4, 2025\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 5, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
