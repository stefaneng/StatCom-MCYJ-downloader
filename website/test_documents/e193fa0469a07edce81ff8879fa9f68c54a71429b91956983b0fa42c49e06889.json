DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nWellspring Lutheran Services is located at 1260 South Otsego Avenue in Gaylord\nMichigan. The facility has 12 offices and a conference room that staff utilize. The\nprogram also has an office in Alpena, Michigan that serves as a place for the Licensing\nWorker to conduct home development in the northeast sector of the State. This\nconsultant visited the office in Gaylord on 05/19/14. The office has adequate space and\nresources to provide for program operations. It is centrally located to serve the northern\ntier of the Lower Peninsula.\nB. Program Description\nWellspring Lutheran Services has been operating child placing programming out of the\nGaylord office since 1999. The program and office has functioned as a satellite site for\nthe licensed parent agency located at 6019 West Side Saginaw Road in Bay City,\nMichigan. The parent agency license number is #CB090201254 and is licensed to\ncertify foster homes, place children in foster care and provide independent living\nservices. The Gaylord program site serves the geographical area consisting of the\nnorthern tier counties of the Lower Peninsula. Fifteen counties total are being served.\nCurrently the program has 24 licensed foster homes and 44 children placed in foster\ncare. There are no youth in independent living at this time. The program is adequately\nstaffed and consists of a CEO, Division Director, Program Manager/Supervisor, four\nCase Managers, a Licensing Supervisor, two Licensing Workers, a Recruitment/Intake\nWorker, two Case Aides, and three Secretaries. The program is actively engaged in\nfoster home recruitment activities.\nDue to the size of the program and for logistical reasons the agency is requesting to\nobtain a separate license for the Gaylord site, but it will remain part of the parent\nagency.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe program is in compliance with all rule and statutory regulations.\n2",
