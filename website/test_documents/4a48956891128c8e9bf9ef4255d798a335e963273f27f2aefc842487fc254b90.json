Supervisor reported she reviewed video footage and\nconfirmed Staff 1 pushed Youth A multiple times, Youth A was\npushed to the floor, and Staff 1 followed Youth A out of the home.\nSupervisor reported Youth A wrote a statement of what happened,\nand it was given to Program Manager.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 11/8/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker.

Staff 1\nreported Youth A went into the kitchen and yelled she was hungry\nand wanted French toast, but there was not enough French toast\nfor her, so she became upset and began screaming.

Staff 1 reported as she was\nfollowing Youth A, she called Staff 2 and then called Supervisor 1\nfor support. Staff 1 reported Youth A began to lose momentum on\nthe path between Ceblek and Ellenbaus houses, so when they\nreached the bridge, Staff 1 said “You can’t attack staff just\nbecause you didn’t get what you wanted for breakfast. That’s\nbullying”. Staff 1 reported Youth A responded, “I hate you”, and\nproceeded to run up the stairs towards the Commons, so Staff 1\n3",
    "followed her. Staff 1 reported she didn’t want Youth A to make it to\nthe street because then she would have to restrain her for her\nsafety, and Staff 1 didn’t feel she could adequately restrain Youth\nA by herself. Staff 1 reported she told Youth A, “You can’t keep\nacting like this. You’re going to push people away that really care\nabout you” and Youth A responded “Shut up. I hate you”. Staff 1\nreported they made it to the top of the stairs in front of the\nCommons when Staff 3 pulled up in the van. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A got in the van and Staff 3 drove her back to McCullough\nhouse.

Staff 1\nreported she never called Youth A any names or threatened to\npunch her when they were outside. MDHHS Worker, Chief\nAdministrator and Consultant watched the video footage with Staff\n1. Staff 1’s response to watching the video footage was “After\nputting my arms up to block [Youth A]’s spitting, it’s all a blur. I\ndon’t remember pushing her” and “It hurts my heart to see the\nvideo. I don’t even remember any of that happening”.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 11/8/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nwent to the kitchen to look for something to eat, but she couldn’t\nfind anything she wanted, so Staff 2 went to the kitchen to help\nher.

Staff 2 reported\nshe walked away and was ignoring Youth A’s behavior because\nthat’s what they’ve been instructed to do. Staff 2 reported she\nwent to the staff bathroom to get the key to the medication room\nso she could pass medications. Staff 2 reported Youth A tried to\nget in while she was in there, but Staff 2 had shut the door and it\nwas locked.

Staff 2 reported she felt Staff 1 was trying to keep Youth A\nfrom going down Youth B’s hallway. Staff 2 reported she never felt\nthe need to intervene because, from her angle, she couldn’t see\nStaff 1 push Youth A like it showed in the video footage. Staff 2\nreported she was only able to see the back of Staff 1, and she’s\njust used to Youth A being dramatic. Staff 2 reported she didn’t\ncomplete an incident report regarding the situation and didn’t tell\nSupervisor anything about what happened over the phone when\nshe called her for support.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at a different facility on\n11/21/23.

    "stands in the kitchen and yells “I’m hungry” again. Staff 2 walks\ndown the hallway (away from Youth A). Youth A follows Staff 2,\ntakes a few steps down the hallway, pulls on a door, and then\nwalks back. Youth A shoves a staff notebook/clipboard off the\ncounter onto the floor. Staff 1 walks out of the milieu, past Youth A\nand into the hallway to pick up the notebook/clipboard. As she\nwalks past Youth A, she says “it’s too early for this bullshit”, and\nthen Youth A hisses at Staff 1. Staff 2 exits the staff bathroom.\nStaff 1 turns around and faces Youth A and shakes her head.\nThen Youth A and Staff 1 take a couple steps towards each other.\nStaff 1 puts both hands out and pushes Youth A backwards twice\nand says “[Youth A] …listen…I’m not one of them”. Youth A\nstumbles but catches herself on the dining room chair. Youth A\nturns around and screams “Bitch!” and runs at Staff 1.

Then, Staff 1 begins walking towards Youth A while\npushing her on her upper chest, which causes Youth A to fall to\nthe ground. Staff 1 still has her hands on Youth A as she falls.\nYouth A remains on the floor in the fetal position crying and\nscreaming. Staff 1 stands over her and says “Not today! Don’t\nstart that today. Do not start”. Staff 2 remains in the hallway\nwatching the entire incident, but due to the camera angles, it’s\nunclear what she saw. Staff 1 turns around, walks back down the\nhall by Staff 2 and Staff 2 picks up the clipboard on the floor.\nYouth A remains crying and screaming on the floor. Staff 1 walks\ninto the dining room, steps over Youth A, and keeps walking.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident Report dated 11/4/23 authored by Supervisor was\nconsistent with Supervisor’s interview.\n• Written statement authored by Youth A was mostly\nconsistent with Youth A’s interview. The only difference is\nin the written statement, Youth A states after Staff 1 pushed\nher to the floor, Staff 1 pulled out some of her hair and\nscratched her. Youth A notes Staff 1 called her an “ugly\nrat”.\n• D.A. Blodget St. John’s Behavior Management Policy (rev.\n1/11/22) states when a youth is in crisis and engaging in\nbehaviors presenting a danger to themselves or others,\ndiversion and de-escalation techniques are the approaches\nstaff will respond with. St. John’s prohibits verbal or\nphysical abuse, threats, or derogatory remarks, any kind of\n6",
    "punishment inflicted on the body including physical force,\nbullying activities, or physical cruelty.\n• Staff 1 had no prior disciplinary records in her employee\nfile.

Staff 1 received Crisis Intervention for\nIndividuals with IDD training on 10/11/23.\n• Staff 2 does not have any disciplinary action in her\nemployee file. Staff 2 received Aegis training on 11/23/22\nand 4/20/23. Staff 2 received BBI Module 2: Preventing\nViolence, Trauma, and the use of Seclusion and Restraint\non 5/25/23.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and video footage reviewed, this\nviolation is established as Staff 1 pushed Youth A multiple times,\nincluding pushing her to the ground. In addition, on 11/30/23,\nMDHHS Worker reported there was a preponderance of evidence\nwhich resulted in a confirmed case for Staff 1.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nDecember 1, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 5, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
