    "Analysis The facility is not compliant with the rule as there is sufficient\nevidence based on Youth A's and Youth B's interviews, which\nwere consistent in reporting staff put Youth A in a chokehold and\nhit Youth A’s his head against the wall. The three staff members\ninterviewed denied Youth A was put in a chokehold, but Youth A\nwas examined by the nurse and was found to have injuries around\nhis neck and head that are consistent with being choked.\nConsultation\nIt is suggested that the agency install a camera on the opposite\nside of the room from where this restraint occurred to eliminate the\nblind spot in this corner. It is also suggested that they review all\nvideo angle to assess for additional blind spots that may need\ncoverage\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff member lacks the ability to perform job duties.\nInvestigation During a conference call on May 22, 2023, MDHHS worker\nreported there was a preponderance of evidence and Staff 1 will\nhave a confirmed case.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance as Staff 1 has a confirmed\ncase.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSI 2022C0207002 with approved CAP\n5",
