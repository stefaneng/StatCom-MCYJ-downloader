    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The\nagency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan in response to the renewal\ninspection completed on 10/13/2022 with a corrective action plan approved on\n10/31/2022. During the review the agency had five violations. Three citations were\nnoted as repeat violations in the current inspection. During this period under\nreview the agency noted that overall compliance was impacted, in part, by the\nprevious year CAP not being reviewed as frequently as intended.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment reported the agency experienced minimal difficulty in meeting\nrequirements during this review period. The Chief Administrator (CA) stated the\nprevious year CAP did not appear to be reviewed as intended which led to\nchallenges related to overall compliance. The CA indicated the agency enhanced\nchecklists and increased supervisory oversight led to improvements regarding\nlicensing reevaluation reports as well as special investigations. The agency found\nafter the CAP was implemented the use of clerical support was ineffective and\ninefficient. The CA expressed confidence that several areas will improve over the\nnext review period.\nFinancial Overview\nNA\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisors are available and coworkers assist as\nneeded. Staff did not report any concerns or areas of need.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. All files were stored securely.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Agency Analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: Licensed foster home did not have any working smoke alarms. All\nsmoke alarms had been unplugged.\nResolution: Foster care worker conducted a home visit and ensured all smoke\nalarms were plugged in and functioning properly. Pictures and a video were provided\nas verification.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
