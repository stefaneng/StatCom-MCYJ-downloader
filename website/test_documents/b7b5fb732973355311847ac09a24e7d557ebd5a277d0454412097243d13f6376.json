    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection • (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family\nDescription time for each child in foster care consistent with the child's\nservice plans, as required by R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420 to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster care workers hosted an unsupervised sibling visit with a\nparent and made a plan for one of the foster youths to ask for help\nif needed. The foster youth requested help but was advised that\nthe visit was unsupervised. The most recent court order indicates\nvisits between siblings are to be supervised.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant was interviewed by telephone on 5/8/2024. The only\nadditional information to the allegation provided was that Youth A\nmoved to a relative’s care and since that time, has become angry\nand aggressive with Parent A and Youth B during visitation.\nComplainant added she believed the visits with Youth A and\nYouth B were to be supervised by Family Assessment Center due\nto Youth A’s behaviors.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via virtual conferencing on\n5/7/2024. Foster Care Worker reported she was assigned the\ncase approximately a month ago and since that time, she has\nbeen working on developing a relationship with Youth B in which\nYouth B feels heard and respected as that is something Youth B\ndid not have with her previous worker. Foster Care Worker added\nit is her understanding that all of Parent A’s visits are to be\nsupervised as, even though the court allowed for unsupervised\nvisits with the younger children, Foster Care Supervisor and the\nprevious worker decided Parent A was not ready for\nunsupervised. Foster Care Worker stated she was not present for\nthe 4/26/2024 visit as it took place on a Friday and the Friday\nvisits were being supervised by Case Aide. Sometime after the\nvisit, Foster Care Worker was told by Youth B and Youth B’s\nfoster parent that Case Aide did not supervise the visit and\nremained in a conference room located near the visit room. Youth\nB expressed feeling brushed off and ignored when she went to\nCase Aide with concerns related to her brother’s behavior during\nthe visit. Foster Care Worker stated Youth B was upset as Case\n2",
    "Aide told her she was not going to supervise and told Youth B to\ngo back to the visit room. Foster Care Worker stated she has not\nreceived any information about this visit from Case Aide, Foster\nCare Supervisor, or anyone else at the agency.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via virtual conferencing\non 5/7/2024. She reported Parent A’s visits with her younger\nchildren are not supervised, but her visits with Youth A and Youth\nB are supervised due to Youth A’s behavior toward Parent A and\nYouth B. Foster Care Supervisor stated Case Aide was told on\napproximately 4/19/2024 Parent A’s visits with her younger\nchildren were unsupervised and Case Aide was to be in the\nconference room near the visit room during those visits. Foster\nCare Supervisor could not remember how Case Aide was told\nParent A’s visits with Youth A and Youth B were to remain\nsupervised. Foster Care Supervisor stated there is typically a\nmeeting with the team to discuss any court orders and/or changes\nto visitation, so there was likely a meeting during which Case Aide\nwas told about the change to the supervision requirement. Foster\nCare Supervisor stated she thinks Case Aide got confused about\nwhich visits were to be supervised which is why she did not\nsupervise the visit on 4/26/2024. Foster Care Supervisor stated\nshe heard Youth B came out of the visit room and asked Case\nAide to come into the visit room to watch the visit, but Case Aide\ntold her “no” because the visit was supposed to be unsupervised.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated Youth A’s behaviors are\n“destructive” toward Youth B resulting in Case Aide frequently\nneeding to intervene and “do the parenting” during Parent A’s\nvisits. Case Aide is trying to not intervene as much to allow Parent\nA to manage Youth A’s behavior on her own. At the end of the\ninterview, Foster Care Supervisor asked what the court order\nregarding visitation stated. When concern was expressed with this\nquestion as Foster Care Worker’s understanding of the\nsupervision expectations did not align with Foster Care\nSupervisor’s, and Case Aide could not be expected to know the\nsupervision requirement if the worker and supervisor did not,\nFoster Care Supervisor stated she knew what the order stated but\nthere have been a lot of court hearings and court orders for this\ncase, and she did not recall the date or specific details.\nCase Aide was interviewed via virtual conferencing on 5/9/2024.\nCase Aide stated she had a misunderstanding of the supervision\nrequirement for Parent A’s visits. She stated Parent A’s visits with\nher younger children were unsupervised and Case Aide was to\nremain in the conference room near the visit room throughout\nthose visits. Case Aide thought the visits with Youth A and Youth\n3",
    "B were also unsupervised, so she stayed in the conference room\nthroughout the 4/26/2024 visit. She reported the visit was\nsupposed to be for 1 hour followed by a family therapy session.\nYouth B arrived for the visit on time and Youth A arrived\napproximately 30 minutes late. After Youth A arrived, Youth B\ncame to the conference room from the visit room and told Case\nAide Youth A was being mean. Case Aide stated it is not\nuncommon for Youth A to be mean during visits, so Case Aide\nhad previously established a plan for both children to be able to\nseparate themselves during visits by going into an open room by\nthemselves until they felt ready to return to the visit. On 4/26/2024,\nafter Youth B had come to talk to Case Aide, Case Aide went to\nthe visitation room with Youth B to talk with Parent A. Youth A had\nalready separated himself by going to an empty room, so Parent A\nwas alone in the room. Parent A stated Youth A was being\ndisrespectful and mean toward Parent A. Case Aide remained in\nthe room, talking with Parent A and Youth B for approximately 10-\n15 minutes until the family therapist arrived. When the therapist\narrived, the therapist, Youth B and Parent A went into the room\nwhere Youth A had gone. Case Aide stated she does not\nsupervise any therapy session. When asked who informed her of\nthe visitation supervision requirements that led to her confusion,\nshe replied her supervisor or Foster Care Worker typically inform\nher if there is change to visitation, but she did not recall when or\nby whom she would have been informed of the change with this\nfamily.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nCourt Orders:\n• 1/12/2024 - Family Assessment Center shall facilitate visits\nbetween Youth A, Youth B and Parent A, weekly. Additional\nunsupervised parenting between Youth B and Parent A is\nallowed as requested by Youth B.\n• 2/16/2024 - Visits shall continue and may be unsupervised\nand at another location at the discretion of the agency.\n• 3/15/2024 – No change to parenting time orders.\n• 4/12/2024 – Parent A may have unsupervised parenting\ntime. Supervised parenting time shall occur only when\nYouth A and Youth B are together.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as, on 4/12/2024, Parent\nA’s visits were ordered to be supervised when both Youth A &\nYouth B were present; however, the agency held an unsupervised\nvisit between Youth A, Youth B, and Parent A on 4/26/2024.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\n4",
    "Technical assistance was offered that Foster Care Supervisor\nreview the court order and meet with Foster Care Worker, Case\nAide, and Case Aide’s supervisor to discuss the court orders and\nvisitation expectations for this family as during investigation\ninterviews there was a lack of understanding by Foster Care\nSupervisor, the newly assigned Foster Care Worker, and Case\nAide as to the visitation expectations.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nMay 14, 2024\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 15, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
