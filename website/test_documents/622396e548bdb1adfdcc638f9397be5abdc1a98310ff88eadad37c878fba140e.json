She reported Youth A was placed at the facility on\n01/19/2023. Youth A had an IUD placed in January of 2022, and\nhad it removed in April of 2022 due to abdominal pain and\ncramping. She said Youth A has a history of wanting to go to the\nhospital, because it’s easier for her to AWOL. She visited Youth A\non 02/07/2023 and Youth A did not report being in pain or having\nissues/concerns.\nI interviewed Consumer Rights Officer at the facility, on\n02/09/2023 in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist. He\nreported Youth A was previously placed at the facility from\n04/22/2022 thru 11/03/2022, returned to the facility on 01/19/2023,\nand has been examined by the doctor and nurse multiple times.\nYouth A has an appointment scheduled with the obstetrician on\n02/13/2023.
