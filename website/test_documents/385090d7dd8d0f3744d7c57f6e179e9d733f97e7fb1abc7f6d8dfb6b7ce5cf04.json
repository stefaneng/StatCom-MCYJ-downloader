RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that\nthe facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nAugust 20, 2018\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 24, 2018\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
