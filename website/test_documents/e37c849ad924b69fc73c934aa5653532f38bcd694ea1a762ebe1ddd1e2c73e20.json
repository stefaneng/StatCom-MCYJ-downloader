    "Youth A at the Hospital. Youth A had reported that staff attempted\nto restraint her at the hospital, so an internal investigation was\ncompleted on 05/26/2023. He found that Staff 2 and Staff 3\nattempted to physically manage Youth A after she attempted to\nAWOL from the hospital. He said Staff are not permitted to\nphysically manage a youth while off campus unless it is a\npotentially lifesaving intervention. It was recommended that Staff 2\nand 3 be provided additional coaching on appropriate behavioral\ninterventions and truancy policy. Staff 3 is currently out on\nmedical leave.
