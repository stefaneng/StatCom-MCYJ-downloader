On 1/11/15, youth told staff she was still upset\nover the event and the staff member started to antagonize the\nyouth. Another staff member was standing between them. The\nantagonistic staff member ran up on the youth and swung on the\nyouth, hitting the youth in the face.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nAttempts were made to interview Youth A face to face at the\nfacility on 1/16/25 in coordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth\nA refused to be interviewed despite multiple attempts made during\nthis visit.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/16/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported she was\ninvolved in both situations. Staff 1 reported on 1/10/25, Youth A\nrequested to go to the bathroom to put on a face mask, so Staff 1\nand Staff 5 went with Youth A to D-wing so she could use the\nrestroom. Staff 1 reported Youth A was already on edge when she\nentered D-wing. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was on D-wing and as\nsoon as she saw Youth A, Staff 2 stood up like Youth A was\nalready trying to attack her. Staff 1 reported when Youth A was on\nD-wing, she was calmly talking to Staff 4 and wasn’t doing\nanything wrong. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was reacting to every\nmove Youth A made, which irritated Youth A. Youth A told Staff 2,\n“girl, I’m not thinking about you”, and continued talking. Staff 2\nreported she was going to step of the wing for a minute. Staff 1\nreported as soon as Staff 2 walked out the door, Youth A grabbed\nthe door before it shut fully and went after Staff 2. Staff 2\nscreamed, “get her, get her”, and Staff 1 saw Youth A grabbing\nStaff 2 by her hair. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was holding onto Youth\nA’s sleeve and her wrist. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 and Youth A were\ngoing around in a circle while holding onto each other, and Youth\nA’s shirt was splitting down the middle. Staff 1 reported Staff 2\nwas swinging on Youth A and kept saying “bitch” over and over.\nYouth A said Staff 2 hit her in the face and then Staff 2 fell on the\n2",
    "floor. Staff 1 reported she was trying to shield Youth A the entire\ntime while Staff 4 and Staff 5 were trying to get Staff 2 off the floor\nand away from Youth A. Staff1 reported Youth A refused to go\nback to C-wing because she got hit. Staff 1 reported Supervisor\nwas present at the end of the situation and saw Youth A holding\nStaff 2’s hair and Staff 2 holding Youth A’s shirt. Supervisor told\nStaff 2 to get off the wing. Staff 2 reported Youth A did not have\nany visible injuries from the situation. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 said,\n“[Youth A] is not going to win. I’m going to keep working with her”.\nOn 1/11/25, Staff 1 reported she was assigned to supervise Youth\nA on C-wing. Staff 1 reported she took Youth A to the bathroom\non D-wing and Youth A saw Staff 2. Staff 1 reported Youth A still\nseemed irritated with Staff 2 regarding what happened on 1/10/25.\nStaff 1 reported she talked to Supervisor about Youth A still being\nupset and asked that Staff 2 not be put on rotation to supervise\nYouth A because she knew there was going to be an incident.\nStaff 1 reported Supervisor said she would investigate it, however\nit doesn’t appear anything happened, because shortly later, Staff 2\nreported for her 2-hour shift to supervise Youth A. Staff 1 reported\nwhen Staff 2 reported for her shift, Staff 1 told Staff 2 to leave the\nwing and said she could handle it by herself. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A said, “why is this bitch here? I don’t like her. I’m about to\nget a code clear called”. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 told Youth A,\n“you’re scary as fuck. You can’t fight. All you do is pull hair. You\nhave nothing to lose and if I scan my badge and open the door,\nyou’re going to be looking stupid and slow because these kids on\nD-wing are going to beat your ass”. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was\nstanding by the door, and Staff 1 was sitting on the couch with\nYouth A trying to keep her calm. Staff 1 reported Youth A said,\n“that’s how you talk to a kid? I’m about to get up and act a fool”.\nStaff 1 reported as soon as Youth A got up from the couch, Staff 1\ngot up and stood between Youth A and Staff 2 to intervene. Staff 1\nreported Youth A was trying to grab Staff 2, but Staff 1 blocked it.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A ended up in the corner behind the door\nbecause Staff 2 attacked her after Youth A tried to attack Staff 2.\nStaff 1 reported Staff 2 said “let’s restrain her”, but Youth A was\nagainst the wall, and they’re not allowed to restrain a youth\nagainst the wall, so Staff 1 refused to restrain Youth A. Staff 1\nreported Supervisor and Staff 3 opened the door and entered the\nwing, and as soon as they did, Staff 2 said, “bitch”, and did a\ndragging punch down Youth A’s face. Staff 1 reported Supervisor\nsaid, “uh uh, you have to get off the wing now” to Staff 2 and then\nStaff 2 left. Staff 1 reported Youth A was upset afterwards and\nsaid, “this bitch keeps hitting me”. Staff 1 reported the whole\nsituation could have been avoided if Staff 2 was never allowed to\n3",
    "be on the wing, or Staff 2 left the wing as soon as things started to\nescalate like Staff 1 suggested she do. Staff 1 reported Staff 2\ncould have scanned her badge and walked out of the room at any\ntime, but she didn’t even attempt to do so. Staff 1 reported Staff 2\nhad multiple chances to get away, but instead, Staff 2 stayed.\nStaff 1 reported it was as if Staff 2 was trying to get her hits in and\nprove something in the situation. Staff 1 reported every time Staff\n2 swung on Youth A, she called Youth A “bitch” repeatedly.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via video conference on 1/14/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported\napproximately 2 days prior to the first incident, she was on C-wing\nrelieving another staff working with Youth A. Staff 2 reported as\nshe was walking onto the wing, she let Youth A know she was\nproviding relief for another staff. Staff 2 reported she was wearing\na fanny pack and Youth A snatched it from her, and smashed\nStaff 2’s phone on the floor, which broke it. Staff 2 reported as she\nwas going to pick it up, two other unknown staff went to hold\nYouth A back because as Staff 2 was bending over to pick up her\nphone, Youth A attempted to attack her from behind.\nStaff 2 reported on 1/10/25, she was working on D-wing and\nYouth A came to D-wing to go to the bathroom. Staff 2 reported as\nYouth A exited the bathroom, Youth A was clearly agitated. Staff 2\nreported when she saw Youth A was agitated, Staff 2 decided to\nexit the wing to avoid any confrontations lingering from a couple\ndays prior. Staff 2 reported after she exited the door, Youth A ran\nup behind her, pulled her ponytail, and pulled her backwards. Staff\n2 reported an unknown staff pulled Youth A off her. Staff 2\nreported she tried to grab Youth A’s wrist to get Youth A off her,\nbut Youth A’s shirt ripped because Staff 2 grabbed the wrist area\nof Youth A’s shirt instead of Youth A’s body. Staff 2 reported\nYouth A is supposed to be in a 2-buddy hold whenever she is not\non her wing but obviously, she wasn’t in the hold on D-wing\nbecause Youth A was able to freely walk, grab the door, and\nattack Staff 2. Staff 2 reported the entire situation could have been\navoided had staff been following protocol. Staff 2 reported\nSupervisor asked Youth A why she always attacks Staff 2 and\nYouth A said, “I don’t like new people. I’m picking them off one-by-\none”.\nStaff 2 reported on 1/11/25, she asked Supervisor if she could not\nwork on C-wing with Youth A because Youth A had attacked her\nmultiple times over the previous couple days. Supervisor told Staff\n2 “no” because Youth A is on a 2-hour staff rotation, and she\nneeded Staff 2 from 9-11 PM. Staff 2 reported Supervisor said,\n4",
    "“hopefully [Youth A] will be asleep during that time”. Staff 2\nreported when she got on C-wing at the beginning of her 2-hour\nshift, Youth A was wide awake. Staff 2 reported as soon as she\nentered the wing, Youth A said, “I don’t want her on my wing”.\nStaff 2 reported she knocked on the window and told Staff 3 Youth\nA was already agitated and she didn’t want to be on C-wing with\nYouth A. Staff 2 reported Staff 3 told her she needed to stay on\nthe wing, but he would watch through the window to ensure\nnothing happened. Staff 2 reported Youth A asked Staff 2 to “go\n30 seconds” with her and Youth A asked Staff 1 to leave the room\nso she could be alone with Staff 2. Staff 2 reported she was\nstanding by the door with her badge in her hand, ready to leave if\nsomething happened. Staff 2 reported Youth A ran up on her, and\nStaff 2 responded by grabbing Youth A’s wrist. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 used her shoulder to pin Youth A to the wall. Staff 2\nreported she yelled “clear” over and over, but no one came. Staff\n2 reported half the staff are on separation plans with Youth A and\ncannot work with her. Staff 2 reported Youth A broke out of Staff\n1’s hold because Staff 1 didn’t do the hold correctly. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 tried to verbally de-escalate Youth A. Staff 2\nreported Youth A kept grabbing her hair. Staff 2 reported Staff 3\nfinally entered the wing and tried to verbally de-escalate Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A swung at her with a closed fist, and Staff\n2 was able to break away from Youth A. Staff 2 reported\nSupervisor entered the room and said, “[Staff 1] exit the wing now\nand go to my office”. Staff 2 reported she left and as she was\nexiting, Youth A said, “bye bitch”. Staff 2 reported Supervisor met\nwith her and said she was taking her badge and keys because\nthere would be an investigation. Staff 2 reported Supervisor told\nher to go to the police department and file a report of Youth A’s\nassault on Staff 2. Staff 2 reported when she arrived at the police\nstation and told the officer where she worked, the officer guessed\nshe was coming to file a report about Youth A because so many\nstaff had already filed reports against her. Staff 2 reported she\nnever tried to hit Youth A, never hit Youth A, or anything similar.\nStaff 2 reported she never instigated Youth A, insulted her, talked\nabout Youth A's fighting skills, or said anything about Youth A\ngetting beat up by other youth. Staff 2 reported she tried to do a\none person hold by herself (grabbing Youth A’s wrist), which she\nknows she shouldn’t have done because it’s not an appropriate\nhold, but she was trying to protect herself. Staff 2 reported she\nwas hoping Staff 1 would grab Youth A’s other arm so they could\nput Youth A in a two person hold, but Staff 1 never did. Staff 2\nreported she asked Supervisor for a separation plan prior to this\nincident, but Supervisor told her there were already too many\nother staff on separation plans with Youth A, so if Staff 2 was put\n5",
    "on a separation plan, there would be no one else to work with\nYouth A. Staff 2 reported she had attempted to fix the issue with\nYouth A by saying, “you keep running all the staff away, but I\ndidn’t do anything to you. What did I do and how can I fix this?”.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A responded, “shut up bitch. Stop talking to\nme”.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/16/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported he was\ninvolved with the situation on 1/11/25. Staff 3 reported he is on a\nseparation plan with Youth A, so he cannot be on C-wing unless\nthere is a significant crisis. On 1/11/25, Youth A was on C-wing\nwith Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 3 reported he heard some\ncommotion on C-wing from the other side of the door, and then a\ncode clear was called over the radio. Staff 3 reported he and\nSupervisor entered the wing to assist. Staff 3 reported Staff 1,\nStaff 2, and Youth A were behind the door when they walked in.\nStaff 3 reported it was clear Staff 2 and Youth A were in the\nmiddle of an altercation because the situation was escalated and\nthere was a lot of yelling. Staff 3 reported due to the amount of\nyelling, he could not pick out any specific comments Staff 2 made\nto Youth A. Staff 3 reported he did not see Staff 2 and Youth A hit\neach other because they were behind the door, and Supervisor\nwalked in before him. Staff 3 reported he and Supervisor\nseparated Staff 2 from Youth A, and Supervisor took Staff 2’s keys\naway from her. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 was actively trying to keep\nYouth A and Staff 2 separated as well. Staff 3 reported he\npositioned himself in between Staff 2 and Youth A until Staff 2\nexited the wing per Supervisor’s direction.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 3/13/25 in coordination\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 reported she was on D-wing on\n1/10/25, and Youth A came over from C-wing to use the\nbathroom. Staff 4 reported Staff 2 was on D-wing. Staff 4 reported\nshe doesn’t recall what occurred between Staff 2 and Youth A.\nStaff 4 reported she never saw Staff 2 hit Youth A, and she could\nnot remember whether Youth A hit Staff 2. Staff 4 reported she\ndidn’t hear anything Youth A and Staff 2 said to each other.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/16/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 5 reported she was\ninvolved in the 1/10/25 incident. Staff 5 reported she was working\non C-wing with Youth A. Youth A went over to D-wing, and when\nYouth A saw Staff 2 on D-wing, Youth A asked Staff 2, “do you\nwant to fight?”. Staff 5 reported Staff 2 tried to walk off the wing as\nsoon as she saw confrontation arising. Staff 5 reported Staff 2\n6",
    "exited through the door, and when the door was almost closed,\nYouth A followed Staff 2 through the door and attacked her. Staff\n5 reported Youth A grabbed Staff 2’s hair. Staff 5 reported Staff 2\nwas trying to put distance between her and Youth A by using CPI\ntraining, but it was unsuccessful, and Youth A pushed Staff 2 onto\nthe floor. Staff 5 reported during the altercation, she and the other\nstaff were attempting to get in between Youth A and Staff 2 to put\nspace between them. Staff 5 reported Staff 1 was also present\nduring the situation, but she cannot remember who else was\npresent. Staff 5 reported Supervisor was involved towards the end\nof the altercation. Staff 5 reported Staff 2 never tried to hit, slap, or\npunch Youth A during the situation. Staff 5 reported Staff 2\ngrabbed Youth A’s shirt when she was trying to put distance\nbetween them, and Youth A’s shirt ripped. Staff 5 reported Staff 2\nwas constantly trying to put distance between her and Youth A,\nand did not instigate the situation. Staff 5 could not remember\nanything Staff 2 said to Youth A.\nSupervisor was interviewed via phone on 2/28/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor reported on\n1/10/25, she was in her office training newly hired staff. Supervisor\nreported she had the cameras pulled up on her computer and she\nnoticed Staff 2 was moving off D-wing. Supervisor reported she\nsaw Youth A was on D-wing, so Supervisor believed Staff 2 was\ntrying to get off D-wing to get out of Youth A’s way and avoid an\naltercation. Supervisor reported Youth A would target certain staff\nand would frequently switch which staff she targeted. Supervisor\nreported she went to D-wing to provide support and heard two\nstaff (Staff 1 and Staff 4) asking Youth A why she would grab Staff\n2 like that. Supervisor reported she retrieved a new shirt for Youth\nA because Youth A’s shirt was ripped. Supervisor reported she did\nnot see the altercation or what happened, so she was not sure if\nStaff 2 hit Youth A, escalated Youth A, or if she handled the\nsituation appropriately.\nSupervisor reported on 1/11/25, Staff 1 and Staff 2 were assigned\nto work with Youth A on C-wing. Supervisor reported she rotated\nstaff shifts on C-wing with Youth A every two hours because\nYouth A was a lot to deal with for staff. Supervisor reported she\nwas in the emergency intake wing and heard a clear being called\nover the radio, so she and Staff 3 reported to C-wing. Supervisor\nreported when she entered the wing, Youth A, Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere all behind the door when it opened. Supervisor reported she\nlooked behind the door and witnessed Staff 1 swing and hit Youth\nA in the face with a closed fist. Supervisor reported she instructed\nStaff 1 to leave the wing immediately and leave her keys on\n7",
    "Supervisor’s desk. Supervisor reported she had to sit on the wing\nwith Youth A for a little while and then met with Staff 2.\nSupervisor reported the week prior to these incidents, Staff 2 met\nwith Supervisor and requested not to be on C-wing with Youth A.\nSupervisor reported they were already short staffed, so she\nexplained to Staff 2 she was unable to grant staff requests to not\nbe with Youth A. Supervisor reported Youth A was lashing out at\neveryone, and she couldn’t accommodate everyone being away\nfrom Youth A. Supervisor reported Staff 2 was not the only staff to\nrequest to not be with Youth A, and she had to ensure Youth A\nhad proper supervision. Supervisor reported this is why she came\nup with a 2-hour rotation for staff, so the number of targeted\nincidents towards staff by Youth A could be reduced, and staff\nwould be less overwhelmed in working with Youth A since it would\nbe shorter periods of time. Supervisor reported there were no\nseparation plans from Youth A for any staff because there was no\nability to do that with low staffing and Youth A’s frequent changes\nin attitudes towards staff. Supervisor reported staff were told not to\nhave a cell phone, bring anything Youth A could take, bring\nanything Youth A could destroy, or bring anything Youth A could\nuse as a weapon when they worked on C-wing. Supervisor\nreported she always had cameras up for C-wing and was\nconstantly checking them, so she could watch and provide\nadditional support if there was an escalated situation or\nemergency.\nVIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 1/10/25 was reviewed. It should be noted the\nvideo does not have audio. Staff 2 is seen walking through the\nroom, and Youth A runs up behind her. Staff 2 turns around\nquickly. Staff 4 walked through a different door and entered the\nsame area. Staff 2 walked around the couch and got away from\nYouth A. Another staff entered the room, but from the camera\nangle, it’s unknown who entered the room. Staff 2 stood by the\ndoor (off-camera). Youth A charged at Staff 2 and Staff 2 ran into\nthe middle of the room to get away from Youth A. Youth A\ngrabbed Staff 2’s jacket and swung her around. While Staff 1 was\nbeing swung around, she grabbed onto Youth A’s shirt sleeve,\nwhich stretched Youth A’s shirt and ripped it. Staff 1 and Staff 5\nmoved and got in between Youth A and Staff 2. Staff 2 fell to the\nfloor. Youth A and Staff 2 were each surrounded by staff to keep\nthem away from each other. Staff 2 was then escorted from the\narea.\n8",
    "Video footage from 1/11/25 was reviewed. It should be noted the\nvideo does not have audio. Staff 1 and Youth A are seen sitting on\nthe couch in the living area of C-wing while Staff 2 stands by the\ndoor with her back against the wall. Staff 1 puts her arm around\nYouth A’s shoulders and gives her a side hug and then removes\nher arm from Youth A’s shoulders. Youth A stands up and begins\ncharging towards Staff 2, but Staff 1 immediately stands up and\nputs her body in between Youth A and Staff 2. Youth A attempts\nto go around the chair to get to Staff 2, but Staff 1 changes\npositions and puts herself in between them again. Staff 2 is still by\nthe door and had the opportunity to exit the wing. Youth A charges\ntowards Staff 2 again, but Staff 1 stands in between them and\nblocks Youth A. Staff 2 backs away towards the couch while Staff\n1 is by the door blocking Youth A. Staff 2 walks up behind Staff 1\nand gets closer to Youth A. Youth A then tries to go underneath\nStaff 1’s arm to get to Staff 2. Staff 2 charges towards Youth A\nwith her hands outstretched and pushes Youth A into the corner.\nStaff 1 is still trying to get in between Youth A and Staff 2 while\nStaff 1 has Youth A pushed into the corner and holds her there.\nThe door to the wing opens and Staff 1, Staff 2 and Youth A are\nbehind the door. Staff 3 and Supervisor enter the wing and look\nbehind the door. Staff 2 backed up from Youth A and Staff 1 for a\ncouple seconds, but then charges back at them, swings her fist\nand punches Youth A more than once. Staff 3 then gets in\nbetween Youth A and Staff 2, grabs Staff 2’s upper arms and\nguides her backwards away from the situation. Youth A squeezes\npast Staff 1 to charge at Staff 2 again, but Supervisor gets in front\nof Youth A to block her. Youth A pushes past Supervisor and\ncontinues to charge. Staff 3 pushes Staff 2 into a little hall area\nand turns around to block Youth A from getting to Staff 2.\nSupervisor and Staff 3 get in front of Youth A, so she is unable to\nget to Staff 2, which allows Staff 2 to get around them and exit the\nwing. Staff 3 and Supervisor are holding Youth A’s wrists, but it\ndoesn’t appear they were utilizing this as a restraint method as\nYouth A is not fighting against them, which means they are not\nrestricting Youth A’s movements.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident report dated 1/10/25 authored by Staff 2 states on\n1/10/25, Youth A entered D-wing to use the restroom. After\nYouth A was finished, Staff 5 and Staff 1 walked Youth A to\nexit D-wing. Youth A stalled at the door and expressed she\nwanted to “go 30 seconds” with Staff 2. Staff 2 exited the\nwing. Youth A ran out the door before it could lock and\npulled Staff 2’s hair. Staff 5 and Staff 1 tried to verbally de-\nescalate Youth A. Youth A grabbed Staff 2’s jacket. Staff 5\n9",
    "pulled Youth A off Staff 2 and Staff 2 exited the wing\ncompletely.\n• Incident report dated 1/11/25 authored by Staff 1 states\nYouth A, Staff 1 and Staff 2 were sitting in the living area.\nYouth A expressed she didn’t like Staff 2 because of the\naltercation that occurred yesterday between Youth A and\nStaff 2, which led to Youth A’s shirt getting ripped by Staff 2\nand Staff 2 called Youth A names. Staff 2 told Youth A,\n“you scary and you can’t fight. All you do is pull hair, and I\nbet you won’t do this to your peers because you scared. If I\nopen this door and let them come over here, you gone be\nscared looking stupid”. Immediately Youth A tried to get up\nand charge at Staff 2, but Staff 1 stood in the middle\nblocking Youth A’s punches. Staff 2 hit Youth A, and soon\nafter Supervisor came to assist with the situation and\nremoved Staff 2. Supervisor and Staff 3 heard a clear\n(segregation for safety) being called from C-wing. Both\nSupervisor and Staff 3 entered C-wing. Upon entering the\nwing, Supervisor witnessed Staff 1 standing in between\nYouth A and Staff 2. Staff 1 was attempting to block Staff 2\nfrom hitting Youth A and Youth A from hitting Staff 2.\nSupervisor witnessed Staff 2 swinging with a closed fist and\nhitting Youth A in the face. Supervisor immediately told\nStaff 2 to exit the wing. Supervisor and Staff 1 placed Youth\nA in a CPI high hold; however, Youth A was able to break\naway from their grip and ran towards Staff 2. Supervisor\nand Staff 1 blocked Youth A from getting to Staff 2, and\nStaff 2 exited the wing with help from Staff 3. After Staff 2\nwas off the wing, Youth A began to hit herself in the head\nand scratch her face. Supervisor was able to talk to Youth\nA and get her to calm down. Supervisor sent Staff 2 home\nimmediately and informed her Human Resources would\ncontact her on Monday.\n• Youth A’s Safety Plan states staff are to remain calm in\ntheir presentation and model possible body-based self-\nregulation techniques. Staff are to structure the\nenvironment and set healthy limits. Staff are to use calm\ntones and supportive words while verbally de-escalating\nYouth A. During transport, Youth A must buddy with 2 staff\nminimum. Staff must have walkie talkies with them. Youth A\nshould not be transported without 2 staff. Safety plan does\nnot state Youth A must be held in a 2-person hold while\nbeing transported.\n10",
    "• Vista Maria Staff and Client Interaction policy states\ncorporal punishment (spanking, paddling, slapping,\npinching, twisting arms, pulling hair, etc.) of youth is never,\nunder any circumstances, permitted. Undignified language,\ncursing, and swearing are viewed as verbal abuse and are\nprohibited.\n• Vista Maria Behavior Management Policy states behavior\nmanagement interventions will not be used as a form of\ndiscipline, to force compliance, or for the convenience of\nstaff. Various de-escalation techniques may be utilized to\nmaintain safety of youth and staff in the environment. Staff\nmust use the least restrictive, safest, and most effective\nmethods and recognize that symptoms are adaptations. All\nstaff are trained on the use of non-physical intervention\nskills such as verbal de-escalation, mediation conflict\nresolution, active listening, and verbal and observational\nmethods to prevent emergency safety situations.\n• Staff 2 did not have any disciplinary actions in her\nemployee file prior to this incident. Staff 2 was terminated\nfrom employment on 1/15/25 because of the 1/11/25\nincident. Staff 2 completed CPI training on 12/16/24 and\n12/24/24.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as per interviews\nconducted, documentation reviewed, and video footage reviewed,\nStaff 2 hit Youth A and pushed her into the corner of the room on\n1/11/25 during the incident between them.\nStaff 1 said Staff 2 was antagonizing Youth A on 1/11/25, but Staff\n2 said she wasn’t. Since Youth A refused to be interviewed and\nthere is no audio on the video footage, it could not be confirmed\nwhether Staff 2 was antagonizing her prior to the physical\naltercation.\nBased on video footage reviewed, there is no information to\nsupport Staff 2 hitting Youth A during the situation on 1/10/25.\nYouth A’s shirt was ripped because Staff 2 grabbed onto Youth\nA’s shirt after Youth A swung Staff 2 around. It appears the shirt\nwas ripped due to Staff 2’s momentum while she was being\nswung around, rather than a malicious act against Youth A by\nStaff 2.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2025SIC0000271 dated 3/19/25; CAP pending\n11",
