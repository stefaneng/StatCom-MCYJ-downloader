    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities: (a) Placing and\nsupervising children in out-of-home care. Social service workers\nshall work directly with the children, their families, and other\nrelevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Care worker is not assisting with reunification services or\nmaintaining communication.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 7/28/25 Parent 1 reported to DCWL that their child was\nremoved from Parent 2 in November 2024. The child was initially\nplaced with Parent 1, then removed by MDHHS Children’s\nServices due to Parent 1’s criminal history record. The child was\nplaced in foster care and the agency did not make any efforts to\nassist Parent 1 with classes and did not return phone calls. Parent\n1 stated this had been occurring for two years and contributed to\nParent 1 repeatedly “losing” in court. Parent 1 was contacted by\nemail on 7/28/25, 7/29/25, 8/1/25, and 8/27/25. Parent 1 did not\nhave a working phone number. In each email contact DCWL\nConsultant requested to schedule a phone interview. However,\nParent 1 never responded to phone interview requests. In an\nemail on 8/1/25 Parent 1 reported he tried to reach out to Foster\nCare Worker and Foster Care Supervisor, but they did not\nrespond. Parent 1 reported his biggest concern was his child was\ninitially placed in his care, then removed and has not been\nreturned. Parent 1 clarified these actions occurred with MDHHS\nChildren’s Services, prior to the case moving to Wellspring. Parent\n1 was informed DCWL was unable to investigate actions\ncompleted by MDHHS Children’s Services. Parent 1 was provided\nwith contact information for resources that may help with those\nconcerns. Parent 1 was informed the DCWL investigation focuses\non Child Placing Agency rule compliance and whether there was a\nlack of effort by the agency to actively implement the treatment\nplan. DCWL Consultant requested for Parent 1 to provide any\ndocumentation or specific information about calls that were not\nreturned, or services not provided. However, Parent 1 did not\nrespond to these requests.\n2",
    "On 8/28/25 Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed via\nvideo call. FCS reported they received the foster care case on\n12/12/23. The case has been assigned to Foster Care Worker\n(FCW) since that time. FCS stated she was unaware of any\nservices or referrals that had been missed. All service referrals\nwere provided to Parent 1 and documentation uploaded into\nMiSACWIS. FCS stated she was unaware of any time that FCW\nmissed contacts with Parent 1. FCS indicated that case contacts\nin MiSACWIS would show that FCW had contact with Parent 1\nmore frequently than the monthly requirement. FCS stated that\nParent 1 has not been consistently active in services such as\ncounseling, drug screens, sober living, and parenting class.\nParent 1 was previously referred to parenting class and\ndischarged ‘unsuccessfully’. As parents can only be referred\ntwice, the agency determined a second referral will not be made\nuntil Parent 1 showed consistency in completing other treatment\nplan items. The agency did not want to refer Parent 1 at a time\nwhen they knew he was not likely to successfully complete the\nprogram, due to other barriers. Parent 1’s communication with the\nagency was inconsistent and he refused to allow staff into his\nhome. While he was not considered ‘absent’ he was evasive and\nwould not respond to the agency at times. FCS stated Parent 1\nmade complaints to the agency before and was provided with the\ngrievance policy but did not submit a grievance. FCS reported\nthat FCW is an excellent staff and there have never been any\nconcerns about his work, nor had there been any disciplinary\naction.\nOn 8/29/25 Foster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via video\ncall. FCW reported he began working with Parent 1 in December\n2023. FCW reported that communication had been poor on Parent\n1’s end. Parent 1 had been non-responsive at times or had a\nphone that was not working/out of service or had changed his\nnumber without informing the agency. FCW stated he has not met\nwith Parent 1 face-to-face since December 2024. Several\nappointments had been scheduled, only to have Parent 1 cancel\nat the last minute. FCW stated he made several attempts to speak\nwith Parent 1 and typically attempts to communicate with him on a\nbi-weekly basis.\nParent 1 was provided with foster care supportive visitation but\nhad several missed appointments and was discharged from the\nprogram. Parent 1 reported to FCW his absences were due to\nfeeling uncomfortable having visits in public as he believed\nMDHHS Children’s Services’ staff were stalking him. Parent 1\nprovided FCW with photos of several license plates he believed\n3",
    "were ‘stalkers’ because they had similar letters on them, FCW\nstated none of the plates belonged to state cars and were likely\nnot MDHHS staff. FCW stated Parent 1 has been refusing\nservices, which is concerning as he recently seemed paranoid and\nindicated he had been hallucinating. FCW reported he has been\nvery honest with Parent 1 about not referring to the parenting\nprogram again at this time, as only two referrals can be made.\nFCW told Parent 1 he was concerned that a referral now may not\nbe in his best interest, due to his lack of transportation, frequent\ncancelling of appointments, and lack of participation in other\nservices. FCW did not want to set Parent 1 up for failure. FCW\nreported that he had tried to have Parent 1 participate in drug\nscreens and therapy. But Parent 1 did not follow through on these\nservices. FCW offered virtual options for Parent 1 to complete an\nassessment intake and attend therapy, but Parent 1 declined.\nParent 1 stated he did not want to open up to anyone or share his\ninformation. Parent 1 later told FCW that he obtained therapy\nservices online and provided FCW with information from several\ndifferent therapists. FCW informed Parent 1 that he needed to\nconsistently see one therapist in order to properly assess and\nevaluate his progress. Parent 1 reported he had a new therapist\nbut has yet to provide any verification.\nFCW stated overall, he continues to try to engage with Parent 1.\nHowever, Parent 1 always has an excuse for why he cannot\ncomplete services or meet. Parent 1 told the court that the agency\nwas not assisting with drug screens. FCW reached out to an\nMDHHS office that was closer to Parent 1, in order to make travel\neasier. FCW also arranged for a case aid to assist with\ntransportation to drug screens after parenting time. However,\nevery time the case aid would attempt to transport Parent 1, he\nhad an excuse why he could not do it that day. FCW scheduled a\nmeeting with Parent 1 for 8/20/25 to discuss the situation, but\nParent 1 canceled that morning. FCW offered to reschedule but\ndid not receive a response from Parent 1. FCW noted after the\nrecent court hearing, Parent 1’s attorney reported he could not\nreach his client. Parent 1’s phone number did not appear to be\nactive.\nDocuments reviewed\nParent 1 provided a two-page typed document via email, outlining\ninformation regarding his case. Parent 1 did not indicate who\nauthored the document, or if the two pages were part of a larger\ndocument. Overall, there were concerns outlined with MDHHS\nChildren’s Services, Parent 1’s former attorney, and a\n4",
    "psychologist who took longer than necessary to complete an\nevaluation. Regarding the agency, it was stated that:\n• Foster Care Worker would not provide transportation for\nParent 1 but later offered transportation.\n• Foster Care Worker made a recommendation in court on\nan unspecified date that was different from what he\noriginally told Parent 1.\n• The August 2024 court hearing ordered for parenting time\nvisits to move to Allegan County, but that has not\nhappened.\n• A court order on an unspecified date ordered parenting\ntime to be increased from the 2 hours per week plan, but\nthat has not happened.\n• Parent 1 completed two parenting classes, which the\nagency said was enough, then asked the court to order\nmore.\n• The 5/28/25 and 5/30/25 drug screens should be\ninadmissible as they did not have Parent 1’s signature.\nA review of the MiSACWIS case record found the following\nrelevant information:\n• Case accepted by agency on 12/12/23\n• Foster care case contacts were reviewed from Dec 2023 to\nAugust 2025. Foster Care Worker completed or attempted\nmonthly phone/text and face to face contacts with Parent 1.\n• Case contacts confirmed information reported by FCW\nregarding attempted phone and face-to-face contacts,\nattempts to change drug screening location, parenting class\ndismissal, and transportation assistance.\n• Court order from August 2024 indicated “DHHS shall make\nreasonable efforts to assist father with transportation to\nvisits and/or arrange for visits at Allegan DHHS and/or\nvirtual visits ASAP”. The order did not specifically state\nvisits had to occur in Allegan.\n• Court orders were reviewed as Parent 1 indicated there\nwas an order to increase parenting time. This information\nwas not found. However, it was noted that court orders\nindicated an increase in parenting time at the agency’s\ndiscretion, when progress has been made with services.\n• Parent Agency Treatment Plans identified several strengths\nfor Parent 1, including sufficient financial skills, intellectual\ncapability, physical health, social support system,\nunderstanding of childcare, and housing. However, the\nhousing had not been verified since August 2024, due to\nParent 1 canceling scheduled visits. Areas of need were\nidentified as parenting skills, resource/availability\nmanagement, employment, substance abuse, emotional\n5",
    "stability behavior, domestic relations, and\ncommunication/interpersonal skills. The assessment of\nthese areas appears to be consistent with information\ncontained in the case file.\n• Parent 1 was documented to have participated virtually in\nFamily Team Meetings to discuss case services on 1/8/24\nand 3/12/25. Parent 1 was invited to, but did not attend\nFamily Team Meetings on 4/9/24, 6/17/24, 9/23/24,\n5/12/25, and 8/20/25.\n• Referral for counseling services was completed on 3/12/24.\n• Supportive visitation and in-home parent education referral\ncompleted on 1/6/25. On 2/18/25 Parent 1 cancelled the\nintake scheduled for that day. The only documented face-\nto-face occurred on 2/27/25. Several scheduled\nappointments were canceled by Parent 1 on the day of the\nappointment.\n• Regarding Parent 1’s concerns about the drug screens\nfrom 5/28/25 and 5/30/25, no screen results were located in\nthe file.\n• Parenting Time Safety Plan date 12/12/24 and signed by\nParent 1 indicated the following plan:\no Relative caregivers can supervise parenting times in\nrelative home or in community.\no Parenting time twice per week, for one hour. Parent\n1 could request longer visits with approval from the\nagency.\no Parent 1 cannot visit outside of designated time.\no Court orders must be followed. Visits outside of\nparenting time or not approved by agency may risk\nplacement\no No unsupervised visits for Parent 1.\no Relative caregivers will notify worker when visits\ntake place and give brief description of visit.\no If emergency arises, caregivers will contact law\nenforcement or agency.\nAnalysis No violation was found. Based on interviews and review of\ndocumentation in the case file, there was no indication agency\nstaff failed to assist Parent 1 in reunification services.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
