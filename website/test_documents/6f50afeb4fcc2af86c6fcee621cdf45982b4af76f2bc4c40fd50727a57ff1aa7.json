Youth A\nwas restrained during the process. Another staff member was reported to observe\nthe fighting and failed to physically intervene to stop the fighting.\n2",
    "INVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 03/10/22 and investigated jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. I sent the information for this complaint to DCWL Intake and Centralized\nIntake after concerns arose during a restraint report review from this situation with\nthe Director.\nAs part of this investigation, I reviewed video of this incident. Video review is\nsummarized as follows: The video started at 11:59:53. Staff 1 was observed in the\ncontrol room and Youths A, B, C, and D were observed in the day room area of the\npod. There was no other staff in the day room with the four youth, who were at a\ntable. About 12:01:06, Youth A gets up, followed by Youth B and the two begin\nthrowing punches, fighting, and wrestling one another to the floor. About 12:01:29,\nStaff 1 exited the control room and walked toward the youth. Staff 1 was observed\non his radio (reportedly calling for assistance) about 12:01:38. Staff 1 then opened\nbedroom doors. About 12:01:49 additional staff entered the pod and Security Officer\n(SO) 2 attempted to intervene and separate the two fighting youth. The boys got up\nand SO2 put Youth A in a restraint at about 12:02:07. Staff 1 did not assist in\nseparating the youth or physically intervening with either youth. Other security and\nsupervisors who entered the pod intervened with both youths. While being restrained\nby SO2, Youth A attempted to go after another peer and that peer was escorted\naway by Supervisor 2. Youth A was the escorted to his room by SO2 and SO1 at\nabout 12:02:43. Youth B tried to get back at Youth A and was held back by\nSupervisor 1. Youth B then walked away, and it appeared staff were giving him\nspace to calm down. The video ended about 12:12:11.\nI interviewed the Director on 03/14/22, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. The Director\nreviewed the video with us and acknowledged that Staff 1 was in the control room\ntoo long and should have intervened in separating the fighting youth. The Director\nsaid that Staff 1 did not have any disciplinary action in his employee file and there\nwere no active safety plans involving Staff 1. The Director said that she met with\nStaff 1 the prior Friday and reviewed supervision expectations.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility, on 03/14/22, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nYouth A’s Foster Care Worker and placement therapist were present at the interview\nfor support but did not actively participate. Youth A provided a consistent report of\nthe incident as compared to what was reviewed on video. Youth A noted Staff 1 was\nin the control room while the other 4 youth were on the pod. Youth A said that Youth\nB got mad and hit Youth A, so Youth A hit Youth B back. They continued fighting\nand repeatedly hitting one another. Youth A said Staff 1 came out of the control\nroom and opened bedroom doors but did not physically intervene “because he’s an\nold man”. Youth A did say that Staff 1 “hurried up” and called security for assistance.\nYouth A said that security came in, as well as more staff to separate the youth and\nYouth A was escorted to his bedroom. Youth A said he was not injured in the\nincident.\nYouths B, C, and D were interviewed at the facility on 03/14/22, jointly with the\n3",
    "DHHS Specialist. Youths B and D reported a fairly consistent account of the\nincident. Youth B additionally reported that he thought Staff 1 was in the control\nroom for 30-40 minutes and didn’t come out for about two minutes after the fight\nbegan. Youth B said that he and Youth A got into another fight later that evening.\nYouth C didn’t remember a lot about the incident including details of the fight or Staff\n1’s whereabouts or actions during the fight. Youth C reported that there is always at\nleast one staff with the youth. Youth D reported that Staff 1 had been in the control\nroom a “couple minutes” before the fight started.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility, on 03/23/22, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 1 reported that he usually works midnight shift but is often mandated to stay\nover for day shift, as he was this day. Staff 1 reported working anywhere from 80-\n120 hours per two-week pay period for several years and that administration does\nnot do anything about it. Regarding this incident, Staff 1 said that Youths A and B\nhad built up to the fight by earlier conflicts that day. Staff 1 said he went in the\ncontrol room and was talking to a teacher about issues like the youth’s computer\nusage, bringing personal items on the pod, managing rising youth tension and how\nto manage the kids to avoid issues. Staff 1 said he was also doing paperwork while\nin the control room. Staff 1 said this was done in the control room to have a private\nconversation with the teacher and to keep the papers safe. Staff 1 said that he has\nsince reevaluated the way he operates and is bringing the paperwork onto the pod.\nStaff 1 said that he was also told to call for assistance/support, even with the “small\nthings.” Staff 1 said that leaving the pod unmanned at any time is not the\nexpectation. Staff 1 said that he was in the control room for three to four minutes\ntotal. When asked why he did not physically intervene in the fighting, Staff 1 said that\nhe would have only been able to secure one youth, which would have left that youth\nvulnerable for the other youth to assault. Staff 1 said that he opened bedroom doors\nto get the other two youth out of the way and called for assistance. This reportedly\nhappened about the same time that the security and supervisors came on the pod.\nStaff 1 reported to be current on his restraint training and indicated he had no\ndisciplinary action in his 10 years of employment.\nSupervisors 1, 2, and 3 were interviewed at the facility, on 03/23/22, jointly with the\nDHHS Specialist. Both Supervisors 1 and 2 reported a consistent account of the\nincident as compared to the video. Supervisor 3 said that most of the incident was\nover when he arrived. Supervisor 1 held Youth B back when Youth B tried to get at\nYouth A. Supervisor 1 and Supervisor 2 said that there is not as much overtime as\nthere used to be. Supervisor 1 noted that Staff 1 asks for overtime. All three\nSupervisors said that staff have been advised to stay on the floor and radio the\nsupervisors/security for assistance when they need something. They said staff were\ndirected not to be in the control room doing paperwork or leaving the pod without a\nstaff in proximity to the youth. When the youth are in their rooms on reflection time,\nthe staff can complete their paperwork. Both Supervisors reviewed the security\nprotocol for staff and teachers entering the building. Teachers are permitted to bring\npersonal items to their offices but not on the pod.\n4",
    "In a follow-up meeting with the Director and DHHS Specialist, on 03/23/22, the\nDirector reported that Staff 1 was in the control room for about 12 minutes, noting\nthat he entered the control room at about 11:49:48. The Director discussed the\nmandated overtime and noted Staff 1 is kept over about three times per week. The\nDirector reviewed security protocol for staff and teachers entering the building and\nnoted that she is not aware of any teachers or staff bringing personal items on the\npods. It was noted that teachers can bring their belongings to their lounge but only\nitems needed for school are brought to the classrooms or pods. The Director\nconfirmed that she directed supervisors to provide additional assistance to staff so\nthat no pod is left without a staff for even a brief time such as a staff going in the\ncontrol room.\nSecurity Officers (SO) 1 and 2 were interviewed at the facility, on 03/23/22, jointly\nwith the DHHS Specialist. Both SOs reported consistent accounts of the incident as\nreviewed on video. Both SOs said that staff and teachers are not allowed to bring\npersonal items on the pod and noted security wands staff upon entry.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n MiSACWIS Incident Report for this incident. The report was consistent with\nthe incident but did not address Staff 1’s whereabouts prior to and during the\nfight.\n Unusual Incident Report Summary, authored by the Facility Manager, dated\n03/03/22. The report was consistent with the incident but did not address Staff\n1’s whereabouts.\n Restraint training records for Staff 1. Staff 1 was current on restraint training.\n Medical documentation from post-incident exam of Youth A and Youth B.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule, evidenced by Staff 1 being\nobserved, on video review, in the control room for over 11\nminutes without other staff on the pod with the four youth. When\nthe two youth began fighting, Staff 1 left the control room,\nentered the day room, and called on the radio for assistance.\nStaff 1 then unlocked bedroom doors for the other youth to get\naway from the incident. Youth A and Youth B continued fighting\nduring this time. Staff 1 did not make any attempts to physically\nseparate them or stop the fighting. The fight was attended to by\nthe supervisors and security who arrived at the area shortly after\nStaff 1 called for assistance. The lack of proximal supervision by\nStaff 1, especially when Staff 1 reported the youth were having\nconflict earlier in the day, and his lack of action to physically\nseparate the youth did not provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of the residents.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan addressing the noted violation.\nApril 17, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 20, 2022\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n6"
