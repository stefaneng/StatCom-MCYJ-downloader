The staff\nperson was hired on 01/10/2022, whereas the central registry was completed on\n11/16/2021.\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan.\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional care, all of\nthe following information shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n(a) The date of and reason for discharge, and the new\nlocation of the child.\n(b) A brief summary or other documentation of the services\nprovided while in residence, including medical and dental\nservices.\n(c) An assessment of the resident’s needs that remain to be\nmet.\n(d) Any services that will be provided by the facility after\ndischarge.\n(e) A statement that the discharge plan recommendations,\nincluding medical and dental follow up that is needed, have\nbeen reviewed with the resident and with the parent and with\nthe responsible case manager.\n(f) The name and official title of the person to whom the\nresident was discharged.\n4",
    "One out of eight discharged case records reviewed did not contain a discharge\nsummary.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there\nare additional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The\nfacility is in compliance will all additional ISEP requirements except for the\nfollowing:\nThe facility is not contracted with the DHHS and not subject to ISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHHS Contract/Policy violation.\nPlease note that there are additional DHHS Contract/Policy requirements that\nmay not be included in section 1. The facility is in compliance with all additional\nDHHS Contract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nThe facility is not contracted with the DHHS and not subject to DHHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements.\nIV.

    "Youths printed Michigan Care Improvement Registry’s (MCIR) did not contain a\nfacility staff signature or date. It is recommended the facility document the review of\nthe MCIR and steps for follow-up if necessary.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were two substantiated incident of substantiated child abuse during this\nlicensing period.\nSIR#2021C0219030 initiated on 02/25/2021 cited the facility for one staff inflicting\ncorporal punishment when staff placed his forearm to a youth’s neck during restraint.\nThe corrective action plan resulted in the termination of the involved staff, annual\nupdated training of all staff in crisis prevention intervention (CPI) refresher training,\nstaff signing acknowledgment and understanding of facility policies and procedures,\nand ongoing review of related policies during weekly team meetings as necessary.\nSIR#2022C0217013 initiated on 11/16/2021 cited the facility for one staff inflicting\ncorporal punishment when staff punched a youth two times after staff was swung at\nand spit on by the youth. The facility was also cited for restraint technique for another\nstaff involved in the same incident. The corrective action plan resulted in the\ntermination of the initial involved staff, the other staff person meeting with\nadministration to review proper CPI techniques, and annual updated training of all\nstaff in CPI. The facility indicates the prior corrective action plan as not being\neffective due to the pandemic forcing the facility to modify its refresher training on\ncrisis prevention and intervention modules.\n6",
    "The Interim Inspection Report 04/06/2021 resulted in a corrective action plan for\nlate/deficient central registry checks, no verification of immunizations, photo at time of\nintake, late preliminary service plan, and service plan periods being reported on. The\ncorrective action plan appears to have been successful as no specific repeat citations\nare currently noted.\nSIR#2021C0106029 initiated on 06/16/2021 cited the facility for restraint procedures\nwhen staff pushed a youth. The corrective action plan included a refresher training in\ncrisis prevention intervention and a three-month work plan to meet monthly and\nreview practices with supervisor.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n02/16/2022\n________________________________________\nChristopher Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 17, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
