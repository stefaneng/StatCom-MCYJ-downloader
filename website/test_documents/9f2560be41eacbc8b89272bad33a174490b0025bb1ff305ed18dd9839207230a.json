INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10107 Employment policies and procedures;\nSection establishment.\nDescription (1) A facility shall establish and follow written employment policies\nand procedures that shall assure that staff are emotionally stable\nand of suitable health, ability, experience, and education to\nperform the duties assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There is a concern that staff member who is no longer employed\nwas in contact with a youth that left the facility. Staff member was\ncounseled regarding their contact/relationship with youth while\nthey were both at the facility. The nature of their relationship while\nat the CCI and after leaving is a concern.\nInvestigation A complaint was received on 5/17/23 alleging that Youth A, who\nwas released from the facility on 4/11/23, was in a relationship\nwith Staff 1. The complaint reported on 3/27/23 Staff 1 provided a\nresignation date of 4/12/23 however she was let go prior to that\ndate. Staff 1 was spoken to several times about her interactions\nwith Youth A as she was spending more one-on-one time with him\nthan any other youth. Staff 1 discussed her personal life with\nYouth A. The complaint went on to state that during Youth A’s stay\nat the facility he received many letters from an unknown individual,\nbut they were believed to have been from Staff 1. Information in\nthe letters referred to things that were known about Staff 1. There\nwere no reports of inappropriate touching or a sexual relationship\nwhile Youth A was at the facility.\n2",
    "Interviews\nComplainant was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n5/18/23. She received information from Youth B's probation Officer\n(PO) that Youth B told his mother a worker at the facility was\nhaving an outside relationship with a youth at the facility. Prior to\nthis, there had been concerns about Staff 1's boundaries with\nYouth A, but they did not have anything concrete. Complainant\nknew it was Staff 1 and Youth A that Youth B was referring to\nbecause there were no other issues with boundaries within the\nfacility. Complainant stated Staff 1 would be seen a lot with just\nYouth A. They would be alone but out in the open folding laundry\nor standing outside the lunchroom. Complainant stated Staff 1\nshould have been attending to the entire group not just one youth.\nComplainant stated in their team meetings Staff 1 had been listed\nas having boundary issues with Youth A.\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 5/18/23. He stated Staff 1 worked for the facility for a\nyear previously, but she worked as an intake worker rather than\nworking on the floor with the youth. Staff 1 resigned after a year to\ngo work for Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\nCA reported Staff 1 returned to the facility 9 months later on\n9/14/2022 and worked on the floor with the youth. A supervisor\nintercepted a letter to Youth A and it was brought to CA's attention\non 4/6/23. The letter that was found made him suspect it may\nhave been from Staff 1 given the content and the conversations\nStaff 1 has had with other workers. CA had his staff search Youth\nA's belongings for other letters. CA reported many letters were\nfound but none of them indicated who they were from or gave\nspecifics about the person. Staff 1 gave her resignation letter on\n3/27/23 stating her last day would be 4/12/23. Due to CA's\nsuspicions, Staff 1's boundary issues, and her pending resignation\non 4/12/23 Staff 1 was asked not to return to the facility. Prior to\nthe letters being discovered, CA stated, there were several\ncomplaints from staff about Staff 1's boundaries with Youth A. She\nwas coached and received additional trainings due to this but her\nbehaviors continued. Two different supervisors talked to Staff 1\nabout boundaries. She was told it did not look good to be\nspending more time with one youth over the others. CA reported\nYouth B told his mother that he was afraid a staff at the facility\nwould give Youth A, Youth B's address. Youth B's mother reported\nthis to Youth B's probation officer who then reported it to the\nfacility. CA stated due to the camera coverage it would be hard to\nget a youth alone. There are not cameras in the bedrooms,\nhowever staff are not allowed in the youth's bedrooms without\n3",
    "having another staff present. He stated the camera footage only\ngoes back 90 days. CA reported there is always someone\nwatching the cameras. Youth A was discharged on 4/11/23. CA\nstated Youth A has been in and out of detention since he was 13\nand is heavily involved in gangs. CA reported Staff 1 did not have\nkeys to the nurse’s station which remains locked unless the nurse\nis working. There are also cameras leading to the nurse’s office so\nStaff 1 would have been seen on camera if she went there with\nYouth A.\nDuring an on-site visit on 7/12/23 CA reported Staff 1 has been\ntrying to get in touch with Youth A since his return to the facility on\n7/1/23. The facility has caller ID and her name was displayed 2\ntimes trying to get ahold of Youth A. CA stated Youth A is very\nmanipulative. He was talked to about Staff 1 and denied any\nrelationship with her. When the letters were found in Youth A's cell\nthey did not have envelops with them. CA stated Youth A did not\nget any outside mail sent to him. Someone had to physically give\nhim the letters. Youth A was re-admitted on 7/1/23. On 7/2 at\n7:04am Staff 1 attempted to call him. The staff that answered the\nphone saw it was her and would not let her talk to him. Youth E,\nYouth A's girlfriend is also at the facility. Youth A turns 18 in\nAugust. When Staff 1 was terminated Staff 1 did ask if she was in\ntrouble. When Staff 1 turned in her resignation letter she said she\nwas resigning due to family issues and moving out of state. There\nwas a rumor that Staff 1 took time off to go to Disney while she\nworked at the facility. She did have time off during the time she\nwas rumored to have gone to Disney. The letters found in Youth\nA's cell indicated the person writing them had gone to Disney.\nWhen Youth A was admitted on 12/1/21 Staff 1 did the intake so\nthat was most likely their first communication. CA stated Staff 1\ndrove a black jeep.\nFace to face at the facility on 7/24/23 CA reported Youth A and\nYouth E do not have any contact with each other while at the\nfacility. They did confiscate letters, but the letters did not say\nanything about Staff 1 they were discussing their plans for their\ncurrent charges.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/18/23. He\nreported he is a supervisor. Staff 3 said Staff 1 was brought up in\na management meeting about her boundaries. They were to keep\nan eye on her. She was seen with Youth A close together on the\nwing. Staff 3 checked on the wing and he would see the two of\nthem alone on the wing. He stated this occurred even after Staff 1\nwas talked to about it. He said they were always out in the open\n4",
    "on the wing, in the gym, or in the canteen. Staff 1 was a floater so\nshe would go check on his wing and spend time with Youth A.\nStaff 3 saw Staff 1 do this multiple times. He could not say\nspecifically when these incidents occurred.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/18/23. He\nstated Staff 1 was close with Youth A. He said he believed Staff 1,\nwho could access his personal information, would give his\naddress to Youth A. He knew Staff 1 and Youth A were close\nbecause Staff 1 would always pull Youth A out of class. Youth B\nstated he already had problems with Youth A. Youth B heard Staff\n1 would take Youth A to the nurse’s station in order to have sex.\nHe thought they were having sex because when a peer brought it\nup to Youth A, Youth A became upset. Staff 1 also brought a vape\nin for Youth A. Youth B said she brought it in to him 2 weeks\nbefore Youth A left. Youth B saw the vape while the boys were in\nthe bathroom and Youth A was on the counter dancing. While\nYouth A was dancing the vape fell out of his pocket. Youth C was\nalso there for this. Youth C told Youth B that the \"breeze\" was\nfrom Staff 1. Staff 1 quit working when Youth A left. Staff 1 also\nbrought Youth A edibles. Youth B heard about the edibles from\nYouth D. Youth D told Youth B that Youth A shared the edibles\nwith Youth D. This was done to solve a beef with Youth D. Youth\nB said he is no longer worried about Youth A. He said he told his\nmom about Youth A getting his address just to scare her. Youth B\nstated Youth A and Youth D were bullies. The youth at the facility\nall knew Youth A could get their addresses from Staff 1.\nYouth A's girlfriends’ grandfather was interviewed face to face at\nhis home on 5/19/23. He stated Youth A did not live with them and\nthat his granddaughter, Youth E, was not home. He reported\nYouth A was with his granddaughter the previous day. The\ngrandfather contacted his granddaughter and she was put on\nspeaker phone so the DHHS Worker could talk to her.

She stated Youth A was with her when we called her\nto find out where he was. Before we could ask Youth E any\nquestions she asked if we were there to talk to her about Staff 1.\nShe reported Staff 1 is her baby's daddy's ex-girlfriend. Staff 1\n5",
    "used to be a staff at the facility. She found out Youth A was\ncheating on her with Staff 1, so she confronted Youth A and he\nadmitted it. Youth E had gone through Youth A's phone and saw a\nnumber she did not recognize so she looked it up on Cash App.\nCash App tied to that number had a picture of Staff 1. She said\nStaff 1 had texted Youth A that she missed him, and she could tell\nother messages had been deleted. Youth E stated this happened\nabout a month or two ago. She called Staff 1 to confront her, and\nStaff 1 admitted to being with Youth A previously but that they\nwere not currently together. Youth E reported she picked Youth A\nup in her car and met with Staff 1 to get Youth A's clothes. This\nhappened at Youth A's parent’s house about 3-4 months ago. She\nknew it was Staff 1 because Youth A told her it was. She never\nactually saw Staff 1. Staff 1 stayed in her car which was a black\nJeep. Youth E stated she thought Youth A was staying with Staff\n1. Youth E had picked Youth A up at an apartment in the town and\narea Staff 1 lives in (per her employee record).

Youth E stated\nshe did not send Youth A any mail while he was at the facility\npreviously. Youth E did not know of any other youth who had a\nrelationship with Staff 1. Youth A told Youth E he started talking to\nStaff 1 when he was at the facility previously and they had sex in\nthe nurse’s office. Youth E thought Youth A was using Staff 1 for a\nplace to stay. Youth A's mother was aware of Youth A and Staff\n1's relationship as Youth A told Youth E his mom and Staff 1 were\nfriends. Youth E said her and Youth A started talking again about\n6 months ago and they are good now. Youth A had told Youth E\nthat Staff 1 brought him vapes and weed pens. He never said\nanything about edibles. Youth A did not say how he hid it or if he\nshared it. She said the vape was probably a breeze because that\nis what Youth A uses, but she did not know for sure.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/12/23\nalong with the DHHS Worker and LE. Youth C stated he has been\nat the facility for 8 months. He did not want to answer any other\nquestions, so he was excused. LE met with him outside the\ninterview room.

Youth A remembered Staff 1 from the last time he was at\nthe facility. Staff 1 was chill and would talk to them when they\nwere upset. She would help them by talking to them. Staff 1 did\nnot have feelings for him that he knew of, and he did not have\nfeelings for her. The only touching allowed by staff is a touch on\nthe shoulder, a pat on the back, or a handshake. The only time\nStaff 1 would have touched Youth A was a pat on the back when\nhe was upset or to get his attention. He would do activities with\nher and about 3-4 times she would take him to the nurse’s office\nwhenever he would ask her to. It would take them a couple of\nminutes and was always just the two of them. He stated there was\nno sexual connection between him and Staff 1 in or out of the\nfacility.

The\ntwo of them were talking about it while in the canteen (game\nroom). It was just the two of them talking, but other youth were in\nthe room. He would use the excuse of warming up water to go to\nthe nurse’s station. They then had sex by the refrigerator. They\nwere kissing at first and he said he wanted to have sex. He stated\nthey started to have a relationship in October of 2022, but did not\nhave sex until 12/17/22. He stated at first Staff 1 was scared to\nhave sex with him so after being in the nurse’s station they\nreturned to the canteen. They talked some more then went back\nto the nurse’s station and had sex. He stated no one else was\naround and it was in a location that could not be seen on camera.\nYouth A stated Staff 1 used to work in intake so she knew where\nthe cameras could and could not see.

She would tell him that\nshe would move out of state with him. Youth A reported Staff 1\nwould bring in a wax pen, edibles and Breeze anytime he asked\nfor it. He asked her to bring in a phone, but she would not. He\nreported she brought items in about 20 times. He would put the\nitems in his waist band and did not share them. Staff 1 did give\nhim the letters that were found in his cell. She would print them off\nbecause the staff at the facility knew her handwriting. He stated\nStaff 1 would mail them to him with no return address. Youth A\nstated he changed his story because he knew she would just\nprotect herself.

She could not remember if Staff 1 ever brought Youth\nA to the nurse’s station when she was present.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the local police station on\n7/24/23. She was interviewed by the DHHS Worker, LE, and this\nconsultant. When Staff 1 came into the interview room she stated\nshe figured this was coming.

She indicated Youth A and Youth F. She\nwould pull them out of class because they had already graduated\nso she would find something else for them to do. She would ask\nthe supervisor if she could take them to fold clothes or rearrange\nthe closet. Staff 1 said she was talked to by the supervisor about\nshowing favoritism and told her she is not a therapist so she\n8",
    "should not be acting like one. She told Youth A she got in trouble\nfor paying special attention to him and Youth A got upset about it.\nHe said she listens to him and helps him. Staff 1 said despite her\ntelling Youth A this he would still follow her. Youth F turned 18 and\nleft so after that it was just Youth A that she would pull out. She\nwould take him to the canteen or to the wing. She said some\nsupervisors said she could talk to Youth A and she would be\ncalled to deal with him when he was acting up. Staff 1 said she did\nnot know why Youth A knew her phone number and where she\nlived. All the youth at the facility know what kind of cars the staff\ndrive. Staff 1 was confronted about lying and she said she did\nspend one on one time with Youth A and she did write him the\nletters but the letters were written just to give him false hope. She\ndid not actually mean what she wrote. She was again confronted\nfor lying and stated she almost had sex with Youth A while at the\nfacility. She took him to check his weight and he grabbed her and\ntried to have sex with her, but she stopped him because she was\nscared of getting in trouble. She stated her pants were down at\nthe time.

She admitted she\nbrought an edible into the facility one time, and he ate it right\naway. Staff 1 said she did talk to Youth E on the phone about\nYouth A. Staff 1 said she did not have any calls or texts on her\nphone from Youth A. She handed over her phone for LE to check.\nStaff 1 stated Youth A's mom contacted her over messenger in\nMay or June to tell her about the investigation. Staff 1 said she\nwould occasionally call Youth A's mother in order to reach Youth\nA. Staff 1 said the two of them were just messing around. They\nwere not boyfriend/girlfriend. Staff 1 denied calling up to the facility\nto talk to Youth A. She thought it was someone posing as her.\nStaff 1 said she has not talked to Youth A since April. Staff 1 was\nagain confronted about lying and she admitted she did have sex\nwith Youth A in the intake shower, but it was quick. She denied\ngiving Youth A oral sex. She did not have a relationship with any\nother youth at the facility. She reported Youth A would ask for\neverything. She only brought in an edible for him which he bit in\nhalf, ate half, and put half in a napkin then in his waistband. Staff 1\nsaid she would send Youth A money through Cash App. Staff 1\n9",

This hallway is off limits to\nyouth unless they are with staff and going to see the nurse. The\nmain hallway has a camera. Once in the main hallway you need to\nturn right off the hallway to an entry way that does not have a\ncamera. There is a refrigerator in this location. Then you have to\ngo left to a short hall that also is not in view of the camera then\nright again to a longer hall that does have a camera. Off this hall is\nan office, exam room, and storage rooms. There is a scale in this\nhallway. At the time of the tour the nurse’s area past the first\nhallway was unlocked and open with no one in attendance.
