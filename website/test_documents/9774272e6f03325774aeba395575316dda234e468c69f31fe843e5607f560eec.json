    "the probationary period or within 180 days,\nwhichever is less, and a written evaluation of the\nemployee's performance annually thereafter.\nOne of seven new employee files reviewed did not have a performance\nevaluation completed within 180 days of hire.\nCCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of\nthe direct supervision of staff, staff shall perform\nvariable interval, eye-on checks of residents.

Youth was admitted on 3/11/25\nand his plan was completed on 4/11/25, which is 31 days.",
    "Repeat Violation Established\nRenewal Inspection Report dated 9/12/23; CAP approved 9/25/23\nCCI Rule 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter\ncare institutions; updated treatment plan\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and\ndate an updated treatment plan for each resident at\nleast once every 90-calendar days following the initial\nt reatment plan.\nThree of three open youth files reviewed did not have updated treatment plans\ncompleted within 90 days following the initial treatment plan. One youth's initial\ntreatment plan ended 4/11/25, and as of 7/25/25, an updated treatment plan had\nnot yet been completed. Another youth's treatment plan was dated 1/10/25-\n4/11/25, which is 91 days. It should be noted this UTP overlapped the date of\n1/10/25 with the youth's ITP. The third youth had two overdue updated treatment\nplans. One was dated 9/5/24-12/5/24 (91 days), and the date of 9/5/24\noverlapped with the previous UTP. The second updated treatment plan was dated\n3/5/25-6/5/25 (92 days), and the date of 3/5/25 overlapped with the previous UTP.\nCCI Rule 400.4166 Discharge plan\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional\ncare, all of the following information shall be\ndocumented in the case record within 14 days after\ndischarge:\n(b) A brief summary or other documentation of\nthe services provided while in residence,\nincluding medical and dental services.\n(c) An assessment of the resident's needs that\nremain to be met.\n(d) Any services that will be provided by the\nfacility after discharge.\n(e) A statement that the discharge plan\nrecommendations, including medical and dental\nfollow up that is needed, have been reviewed\nwith the resident and with the parent and with\nthe responsible case manager.\nTwo of two closed youth files reviewed did not include the information contained\nin subsections (b-e) of the rule.",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The start date of the updated treatment plan should be one day after the end\ndate of the previous treatment plan. Overlapping dates were the cause of some\nof the facility's updated treatment plans being overdue.\n• When using a date calculator to determine due dates for treatment plans, the\nfacility should use 29 days and 89 days instead of 30 days and 90 days to ensure\nreports do not go overdue.\n• The electronic system staff are using to enter bed checks does not seem to be\nefficient as there were multiple bed checks completed over 15 minutes. In talking\nwith the facility, staff reported they complete bed checks, then have to enter the\nbed checks in the computer and by the time they do that, it's time for another bed\ncheck. The facility should consider getting a tablet so staff can walk around with\nthe tablet and enter bed checks in real time.\n• The facility must create and follow a uniform process for employee records to\nensure all the information required by licensing rules is in the employee's file,\nespecially at the time of the facility's annual audit. The electronic files provided by\nHR were missing multiple documents. The HR file can come from the program\ndirectly or HR, but the file provided must include all required documents.\n• The facility's case management supervisor was provided instructions regarding\nthe requirements of discharge plans during another facility's audit in February\n2025. The discharge plans reviewed in this audit were missing the required\ninformation, which was discussed again with the case management supervisor\nduring the on-site visit.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require or request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nfacility had one CAP as a result of their 2024 Interim Audit dated 9/17/24; CAP\napproved 10/11/24. The facility had violations for Rule 113(1)(g) and 113(1)(h).\nTo address the violations, the facility updated their new hire and transfer hire\nchecklists to include background check requirements and subsequent actions if\ncriminal convictions are found, required Chief Administrator to sign off on the",
    "checklists prior to hiring staff, held quarterly CAP compliance meetings to review\ncompleted hiring checklists and discuss issues, completed a written assessment\nof the employee’s criminal conviction, and received the employee’s written\nstatement regarding their criminal conviction.\nAnother CAP was a result of SIR #2025SIC0000198 dated 2/21/25; CAP\napproved 3/12/25. The facility had a violation for Rule 109(1)(c) due to a previous\nstaff admitting to violating the facility’s cell phone policy, the same previous staff\nadmitting to violating the facility’s resident offsite supervision policy, and three\ncurrent staff not following the staff code of conduct policy and PSA manual\nprocedure outlining the steps for mandated reporting. To address the violations,\nthe facility completed a live mandated reporter training for all staff, completed a\nmandatory in-person mandated reporter and staff code of conduct training for all\nstaff, had staff sign off on policies related to the violation, put the three current\nstaff on administrative leave, and made a note in the previous staff’s file she\nwould not be eligible for rehire.\nA third CAP was a result of SIR #2025SIC0000297 dated 2/21/25; CAP approved\n3/12/25. The facility had a repeat violation for Rule 109(1)(c) due to a staff\nviolating the facility’s cell phone policy. To address the violation, the facility\nplaced the staff on administrative leave during the investigation, had the staff sign\nthe cell phone policy again in front of the branch director, the branch director\nissued the staff a written warning, and required all staff to complete the “Mobile\nCommunication Device Use for Agency Business” training annually.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's budget and financial audit were reviewed, and there were no financial\nconcerns noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported the program continues to have quarterly CAP\nmeetings with the treatment team which includes the quality assurance team,\nprogram director, program supervisor, and clinical supervisor as they all complete\nthe hiring process. In addition, the quality assurance team has also worked on the\nnew hire coversheet and transfer hire coversheet to ensure the program stays in\ncompliance. The additions and changes to these coversheets have had a positive\nimpact on the hiring process.",
    "Staff and Youth Interviews\nOne supervisor reported they have a good team, they work together well, and they\ncommunicate well. She reported the new program director has been good for the\nprogram, especially regarding holding staff and youth more accountable. She\nreported the youth have responded well to having a more standard point system\nestablished for behaviors and expectations, which was something the new\nprogram director implemented. She reported she has felt more supported in her\nrole and has had more of a voice since the Branch Director became her direct\nsupervisor. She reported being the case management supervisor for three different\nprograms is a lot, so she hopes another solution is found for one program so she\ncan keep the other two similar programs.\nAnother supervisor reported there is a need for more support for and follow-\nthrough from the case management team. He reported he feels more supported in\nhis role with the new program director in place. He reported the previous program\ndirector’s check-ins would be “hey, how are you?”, while the new program director\nhas helped support him navigate things with the program to make them less\ncomplicated, more simplified, and more effective. He reported the new program\ndirector is very forward-thinking and checks in with all the youth and staff in the\nentire program by having 1:1 meetings. He reported the new program director\nchanging the points system for the youth has been a great change because it puts\nmore ownership on the youth rather than the staff and program. He reported\npreviously staff were deducting points from youth without providing sufficient\nexplanations, but that’s now changed, and they’re working on being more\nconsistent and not faulting the youth for staff errors. He reported they’ve been\nfocusing on working with the youth during treatment team meetings to teach them\nto be leaders in the home and be advocates for themselves as well as others. He\nreported there’s been a lot of growth and maturity amongst the youth in the\nprogram, which has been great to see. He reported there are multiple job openings\nfor youth specialists right now. He reported there have been a lot of changes\ninternally with the screening, hiring and onboarding processes, which has been\nmore effective in getting qualified and higher quality candidates.\nThe youth specialist interviewed reported interacting with the youth while doing\noutings, walking, riding bikes, doing activities, etc. has been the best part of his\nemployment. He reported he noticed the youth had certain behaviors when he first\nstarted and he’s seen so much growth in them over the last 9 months, which has\nbeen amazing to witness. He reported they’re working on developing each youth’s\nindividuality by doing independent outings, learning how to cook, helping increase\ntheir maturity, encouraging participation in extra-curricular activities, etc. He\nreported he would like to see increased communication and organization within the\nprogram. For example, if youth have soccer practice on the calendar and it’s\ncancelled, the person who found out it was cancelled won’t delete the information\noff the calendar or doesn’t update addresses if the locations are changed. He\nreported more communication amongst program staff will lead to better support",
    "and more consistency for the youth, so he hopes to see positive changes. He\nreported he feels more supported in his role with the new assistant supervisor in\nplace. He reported the new assistant supervisor is quick to follow-up, takes notes\nduring 1:1 meetings, and asks good questions, which makes him feel heard. He\nreported when he first started as a youth specialist 9 months ago, he doesn’t feel\nhe was taught properly or guided fully in depth with his job and role, so he makes it\na point to help teach others. He reported he feels comfortable providing feedback\nto management if he has any.\nYouth reported they like everything at the facility and there’s nothing they don’t\nlike. They reported staff treat them well, and they don’t have any concerns about\nstaff. They reported they feel safe at the facility. They reported the food is good\nand they get enough food.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility was completed on 7/25/25 and there were no safety\nconcerns noted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nAugust 11, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 15, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
