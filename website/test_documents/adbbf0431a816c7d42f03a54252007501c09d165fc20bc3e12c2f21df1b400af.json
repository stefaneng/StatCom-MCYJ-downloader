    "09/30/2022 Contact - Telephone call made\nInterview with Foster Care Worker 2\nALLEGATION:\nAllegation #1 - Agency denied parent their parenting time visit with infant in foster\ncare despite parent confirming visit timely.\nAllegation #2 - Parent was not provided required visitation with her son despite\nthere being a court order for parenting time in place.\nINVESTIGATION:\nAllegation #1 – On 8/2/2022 I was assigned to investigate allegations that Foster\nCare Worker told Complainant a month and a half ago that she no longer needed to\nconfirm her parenting time visitation with her infant son, Youth A, by 8AM, rather she\ncould confirm by 10AM. This was after months of confirming and visiting\nconsistently. Complainant alleged that on the date of the complaint, 8/2/2022, she\nwas denied her 4PM parenting time with Youth A due to confirming after 9AM.\nComplainant alleged that she was then told that there had been no change to her\nconfirmation time of 8AM, despite Complainant having emails from Foster Care\nWorker to the contrary. Complainant added that she is breastfeeding Youth A during\nparenting time.\nInterviews\nComplainant – On 8/5/2022 I interviewed Complainant by phone. Complainant, who\nis also the mother of Youth A, stated when her case with Youth A began, she had\nsupervised parenting time with her infant son, Youth A, two times per week at the\nagency. She stated initially parenting time took place at 10AM and she had to\nconfirm that she would be attending each visit by 8AM the morning of the visit. She\nstated 6/21/2022 was that last visit that was scheduled for 10AM for which she\nconfirmed before 8AM. Complainant stated she asked Foster Care Worker (FCW)\non 6/21/2022 if she still had to confirm by 8AM starting 6/22/2022 since her visits\nwere moving from 10AM to 4PM, to which FCW responded that she could confirm by\n10AM moving forward. Complainant stated there have multiple times since that date\nthat she confirmed after 8AM for parenting times that were subsequently held. She\nreported on 8/2/2022 she emailed FCW shortly after 9AM to confirm her 4PM visit\nand FCW responded that, since she had not confirmed by 8AM, her visit would be\ncancelled. Complainant stated she continued to email FCW, Supervisor, and\nProgram Manager from 9-11AM as she did not understand why this visit was being\ncancelled when she had previously been confirming after 9AM and that it was\ndetrimental to her child to not be allowed the visit. She stated she received a\nresponse at 11AM that she would not be allowed to have her visit.\nProgram Manager – On 8/8/2022 I interviewed Program Manager (PM) in-person at\nthe agency. Program Manager reported the only time Complainant was allowed to\nconfirm after 8AM was for a medical appointment Youth A had for which\nComplainant was allowed to confirm she would be attending by 10AM. On 8/30/2022\n3",
    "I spoke to PM via Microsoft Teams and asked if there had been a parenting time\nguidelines form completed and signed by Complainant regarding Youth A, as the\nform I was given was dated in 2021. She stated she believed there was and would\ncheck with FCW.\nFoster Care Worker - On 8/8/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) in-\nperson at the agency. FCW reported Complainant has to confirm each parenting\ntime by 8AM the morning of each visit. She stated the time had been the same for\nher previous children in foster care as well. FCW worker stated when Youth A was\nborn, she told Complainant she had to confirm parenting time for him by 8AM. She\nstated a Family Team Meeting (FTM) was held in April during which Complainant\nasked if she still had to confirm by 8AM and she was told she did. FCW denied\ntelling Complainant on 6/21/2022 that she could start confirming later beginning\n6/22/2022. FCW stated Complainant confirmed her 8/2/2022 via email at 9:06AM\nand was told she had confirmed too late, and the visit would be cancelled. FCW\nreported this was the only time Complainant had confirmed after 8AM. FCW denied\nallowing Complainant to ever have a visit despite not confirming timely.\nSupervisor – On 8/8/2022 I interviewed Supervisor in-person at the agency.\nSupervisor reported she was present for the April FTM during which Complainant\nwas told she had to confirm her visits by 8AM. She stated that 8/2/2022 was the only\nvisit Complainant had not confirmed by 8AM.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nEmails – On 8/10/2022 I received three emails from Complainant with screenshots\nof the following emails attached:\n 6/22/2022 at 9:01AM from Complainant to FCW – confirming her visit\n 6/22/2022 from FCW to Complainant thanking her for confirming and stating,\n“see you at 4.”\n 6/25/2022 from Complainant to FCW at 9:15AM to FCW – confirming her visit\n 6/25/2022 from FCW to Complainant – thanking her for her confirmation\n 6/28/2022 at 8:39AM from FCW to Complainant asking her to confirm if she\nwanted a two-hour visit by 11AM\n 6/29/2022 at 9:15AM from Complainant to FCW & Supervisor– Confirming her\nparenting time\n 6/29/2022 from FCW to Complainant & Supervisor - thanking Complainant for\nconfirming her visit\n 8/2/2022 at 9:06AM – from Complainant to FCW confirming her visit\n 8/2/2022 at 9:18AM – from FCW to Complainant stating visit would be cancelled\nbecause she confirmed her visit at 9:06AM and to refer to the parenting time\nguidelines she had been given\n 8/2/2022 at 9:36AM – from Complainant to FCW stating that FCW must have\nforgotten about confirmation time changing to 10AM\n4",
    " 8/2/2022 at 9:42AM – from Complainant to FCW and Supervisor stating that\nwhen visit times were at 12PM she had to confirm, but when they changed to\n4PM FCW told her she had to confirm by 10AM\n 8/2/2022 at 9:46AM – from FCW to Complainant stating that just because the\nvisit times changed, the confirmation time did not\n 8/2/2022 at 9:49AM – from Complainant to FCW stating FCW specifically told her\nthat the confirmation time changed from 8AM to 10AM almost two months ago\n 8/2/2022 at 9:54AM – from Complainant to FCW & Supervisor stating her\nconfirmation time is 10AM and she was not informed it had changed to 8AM\n 8/2/2022 at 10:03AM – from Supervisor to Complainant stating that confirmation\ntime is and always has been 8AM and referred Complainant to her parenting time\nguidelines\nOn 8/8/2022 I received and reviewed the following emails forwarded from PM:\n 7/2/2022 at 5:59AM– from Complainant to FCW & Supervisor stating that she\nhas not heard from FCW regarding a medical appointment for Youth A on\n7/25/2022 and that she will plan on confirming by 10AM\n 7/2/2022 at 9:43AM from FCW to Complainant stating that Complainant can\nconfirm attendance at the 7/25/2022 appointment by 10AM\n 7/25/2022 at 7:05AM from Complainant to FCW confirming her attendance at the\nmedical appointment\nOn 8/11/2022 I emailed copies of the screenshots Complainant had forwarded to me\nshowing that she had confirmed after 9AM for multiple visits starting 6/22/22 and\nleading up to the 8/2/22 visit which was cancelled due to her confirming after 8AM to\nFCW. FCW responded that she “must have let them slip, meaning I didn’t pay too\nmuch attention to the time in which she was confirming.”\nFTM – I reviewed a copy of the Family Team Meeting Report from a 3/28/2022 FTM\ndocumenting the following:\n Parenting time is to take place Mondays & Wednesdays from 10-11AM until\nfurther notice\n Complainant is to confirm attendance at each parenting time by 8AM on the day\nof the visit\n Complainant will follow parenting time guidelines until further notice\n FCW will send Complainant parenting time guidelines by 4/11/2022\nParenting Time Guidelines – I reviewed the parenting time guidelines which\nincluded a statement that visits are Mondays and Wednesdays 10AM-11AM with a\nconfirmation time of 8AM on the day of the visit. This was signed by Complainant\n11/8/2021. No copy of the parenting time guidelines revised and provided to\nComplainant by 4/11/2022 was provided or located in the case file. Additionally, no\nrevised parenting time guidelines reflecting the change in visitation time from the\nprevious 10AM to the current 4PM and the time in which Complainant is to confirm\nher attendance was provided or located in the case file.\n5",
    "Allegation #2 - On 8/23/2022 I received an allegation from Complainant that she\nhas been denied visits with Youth B for months without a court order to do so.\nComplainant alleged Foster Care Worker and Supervisor told her that there wasn’t a\ncourt order for parenting time, but during a hearing last week, the referee indicated\nparenting time had been ordered.\nInterviews\nComplainant – On 9/22/2022 I interviewed Complainant by phone. She reported on\n1/13/2022, upon termination of her parental rights of Youth B being overturned on\n11/9/2021 following an appeal, the court ordered parenting time resume\nimmediately. The order indicated these visits were to occur based on\nrecommendations by Youth B’s counselor. She reported she did not have her first\nvisit with Youth B until 7/28/2022. Parent A provided the following timeline:\n 1/13/2022 – Parenting time ordered at counselor’s recommendation; no\nparenting time initiated\n 2/17/2022 – Parenting time ordered, no longer requiring counselor’s\nrecommendation; no parenting time initiated\n 5/12/2022 - Complainant stated she asked Foster Care Worker and\nSupervisor several times when visits with Youth B. She stated that her\nquestions were ignored until 5/12/022 at which time Supervisor responded\nthat she was waiting for counselor’s approval to start parenting time.\n 6/17/2022 - Complainant asked again about parenting time and Supervisor\nresponded that she needed the counselor’s recommendation.\n 7/15/2022 - Complainant reached out again after which Supervisor\nresponded that she was having a meeting with the therapist on the\n7/17/2022.\n 7/19/2022 - Complainant reached out about the results of the 7/17/2022\nmeeting and Supervisor responded the agency was working on arranging\nvisits.\n Complainant was told the visits would be once every 2 weeks at Youth B’s\ncounselor’s office during the last 30 minutes of Youth B’s session.\n 7/28/2022 – Complainant was given her first visit with Youth B, which was 30\nminutes at the counselor’s office.\n 2 weeks later - A second 30-minute visit took place at the counselor’s office,\nbut Complainant could not recall the date.\n 8/17/20202 – a hearing was held during which the referee was upset about\nthe lack of parenting time and asked the agency staff what gave them the\nright to withhold Complainant’s visits.\n 8/26/2022 – Complainant’s first one-on-one parenting time with Youth B was\nscheduled to occur, but Youth B’s caregiver, who is also Complainant’s\nfather, refused to bring Youth B to the visit. Complainant was able to have a\nZoom meeting with Youth B that lasted a few minutes.\n6",
    " 9/2/2022 – Complainant had her first supervised parenting time with Youth B\nat the agency, which lasted 1 hour.\nProgram Manager – On 8/30/2022 I interviewed Program Manager (PM) via\nMicrosoft Teams. Program Manager stated there was a lot of confusion between\nwhat was written in the court orders and what was said in the court room regarding\nvisitation. She stated the understanding was that the court had ordered visits at the\ndiscretion of and supervised by Youth B’s therapist and the therapist supervised\nthese visits for 30 minutes every week. PM stated she wasn’t aware until recently\nthat the visits were only 30 minutes. She stated these visits were not occurring\nconsistently due to Youth B’s caregiver, his maternal grandfather, not being\nconsistent with bringing Youth B to the therapist appointment. PM stated during the\nAugust hearing, it was clarified by the referee that visits were not required to be\nsupervised by the therapist and that they were to be occurring at a minimum of 2\nhours per week. Since that time, there has been difficulty arranging visits as Youth\nB’s caregiver refuses agency access to Youth B and refuses to allow visits. PM\nstated they are currently working with the GAL and the court regarding this issue and\nmay have to involve law enforcement to ensure the caregiver allows the visits. PM\nstated she does not believe a parenting time exception was ever completed for this\ncase and that they are discussing with staff the importance of closely reading every\ncourt order to ensure the parenting time that is ordered is being provided.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nVisitation Plan – I reviewed the visitation plan documented in MiSACWIS. The\nvisitation plan was effective 11/9/2021- 8/11/2022 and states “no parental visitation\nwithout approval of therapist.”\nCourt Orders – On 8/23/2022 I reviewed the court orders for Youth B in MiSACWIS.\nThe orders regarding parenting time were as follows:\n 1/13/2022 – at the discretion of the child’s counselor/therapist and supervised\n 2/17/2022 – parenting time ordered, unsupervised or supervised box not checked\n 6/17/2022 – prior orders remain in effect\n 7/13/2022 – parenting time is supervised\n 8/17/2022 - parenting time is supervised\nEmails – On 8/24/2022 I received an email from Supervisor stating the court stated\nparenting time with therapist supervision was ordered two hearings ago and the\nGAL, Supervisor, FCW and therapist had a meeting during which it was agreed visits\nwould take place 30 minutes every other week. Supervisor stated at the most recent\nhearing, the referee was upset that Complainant was not getting two hours a week\nparenting time and ordered the visits be at the agency moving forward due to the\ntherapist not being able to supervise the amount of time needed.\nOn 8/25/2022 I received an email from FCW stating Youth B did not begin having\nparenting time until 7/28/2022 which took place the last half hour of his counseling\nsession at his therapist office. She stated there was a lot of confusion as to how\n7",
    "parenting time should proceed. She reported at the 8/17/2022 hearing it was\ndiscussed that there was not a court order stating visits had to take place at the\ntherapist office for half hour or that the therapist needed to be involved in the visits.\nCase Contacts – On 8/30/2022 I reviewed case contact in Complainant’s file\nregarding initiating parenting time between Youth B and Complainant:\n 6/28/2022 Email from FCW to Therapist – Youth was approved for supervised\nparenting time with Complainant\n 7/20/2022 Home visit with Caregiver, Youth B, and FCW. Caregiver notified that\nsupervised parenting time with Complainant ordered. Caregiver stated, “that is\nnot happening.”\n 7/21/2022 FTM via Microsoft Teams occurred with GAL, FCW, Supervisor,\nTherapist and Complainant. Therapist spoke to Complainant about parenting\ntime starting out as half hour every two weeks due to the newness of the visits.\nComplainant was upset that this time was not adequate. First visit to occur\n7/28/2022.\n 8/25/2022 phone contact between DHHS Monitor and Caregiver. Caregiver\nconcerned about emotional impact of visitation on Youth B and stating he wanted\nZoom visits, starting after Youth B started school next week.\n 8/26/2022 Zoom parenting time between Youth B and Complainant.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nAn agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nparenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Provisions for visits between parents and children\nexcept where parental rights have been terminated or\nwhen there is a court determination that visits are\ndetrimental to the child.\nANALYSIS: Allegation #1: Complainant was denied a visit with Youth A on\n8/2/2022 due to not confirming timely, despite having confirmed\nwithin the timeframe she had confirmed for the majority of her\nvisits since 6/2/2022.\nAllegation #2: Complainant was not provided visitation with\nYouth B until 7 months after the court ordered visitation to occur.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06I (p. MAINTAINING CONNECTIONS: PARENTING TIME, SIBLING\n3 & 4) VISITATIONS, AND CONTACT\nFrequency of In-Person Parenting Time\nThe minimum frequency guidelines for in-person parenting time\ndetailed below are to be followed immediately upon out-of-home\nplacement, unless otherwise ordered by the court:\n8",
    "• Newborn to age five: twice per week.\nDuration\nParenting time should be long enough to promote parent-child\nattachment. At a minimum, in-person parenting time should last\nfor at least one hour. The duration of virtual parenting time may\nvary in accordance with the child's needs and development.\nLocation\nParenting time should occur in a child and family friendly setting\nconducive to normal interactions between the child and\nparent(s).\nIn-Person Parenting Time Exceptions\nFamilies with children in foster care who have a goal of\nreunification must have in-person parenting time unless an\napproved exception exists. Exceptions to this requirement\ninclude:\nThe court orders less frequent parenting time. • One or both\nparents cannot attend due to compelling circumstances such as\nhospitalization or incarceration. • The child is above the age of\n16 and refuses to participate. • The parents are not attending\ndespite the caseworker taking adequate steps to ensure the\nparents’ ability to participate. Note: This exception must only be\nused when a parent is chronically and habitually missing\nparenting time. When this exception is used, the caseworker\nmust document (in the case service plan) efforts to assist the\nparent in resolving the barriers to attending parenting time.\nCaseworkers must record all exceptions in MiSACWIS.\nCaseworkers must document all reasonable efforts to ensure in\nperson parenting time in the case service plan. When an\nexception is recorded, the caseworker must review the child’s\npermanency goal; see FOM 722-09A, Foster Care -\nReunification Assessment. Exceptions must be reevaluated\nquarterly or anytime circumstances necessitate a change to the\nparenting time plan.\nDOCUMENTATION\nThe frequency, location, duration, specific behavioral\nexpectations, and other requirements for in-person and virtual\nparenting time described above must be documented in the\nparenting time plan. Parenting time and sibling contact must be\ndocumented in social work contacts; see FOM 722-06H, Case\nContacts. Note: If in-person parenting time occurs less\nfrequently than required in the Frequency of In-Person\n9",
    "Parenting Time section of this item, the reasons must be\ndocumented in the parenting time plan.\nANALYSIS: Allegation #1: Parenting time was denied with Complainant’s\ninfant son on 8/2/2022, despite there being no updated\nparenting time plan that documented the accurate time and\nfrequency of the visits and time in which Complainant was to\nconfirm each visit.\nAllegation #2: When parenting time was initiated between\nComplainant and Youth B, the visits were not occurring at the\nrequired intervals as Youth B is below the age of 6 and\nparenting time was initially occurring for 30 minutes once every\ntwo weeks then once a week for one hour and there was no\nparenting time exception completed. Additionally, the location of\nthe initial visits was at Youth A’s counselor’s office rather than a\nfamily friendly setting, despite there being no court order\nrequiring visits to take place with the counselor.\nNeither of the parenting times that took place at the counselor’s\noffice were documented in case contacts, as required.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nParent was not provided the accurate grievance procedure.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 8/5/2022 during a phone interview with Complainant, she alleged that she has\nrequested the grievance procedure from Foster Care Worker multiple times but has\nonly been provided with a grievance procedure written for foster youth.\nInterviews\nComplainant – On 8/5/2022 I interviewed Complainant by phone. She reported\nwhenever she has concern with FCW, she contacts Supervisor, then PM. She stated\nthat her concerns are never resolved. She stated she has asked FCW multiple times\nfor the agency’s grievance procedure, but she has only been provided with a\nprocedure that is intended for foster youth. When she told FCW she had sent\nComplainant the wrong procedure, FCW told her it was the only one the agency had.\nSupervisor – On 8/8/2022 I interviewed Supervisor in-person at the agency.\nSupervisor reported Complainant has asked her in the past for the agency grievance\nprocedure, which Supervisor gave her verbally over the phone.\nFoster Care Worker - On 8/8/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) in-\nperson at the agency. FCW stated she has provided Complainant with the grievance\n10",
    "procedure many times. She stated that she has sent the same policy each time and\nlast emailed it to Complainant in April and again in March. She stated the policy she\nsent is the only one FCW is aware of. FCW looked through her emails and located\nthe last emails she sent to Complainant with the grievance procedure and forwarded\nthose emails to PM.\nProgram Manager – On 8/8/2022 I interviewed Program Manager (PM) in-person at\nthe agency. PM looked at the emails forwarded to her by FCW and stated the\nattached grievance procedure was an outdated document and was intended for\nfoster youth. She stated although this policy was written for youth rather than\nparents, the steps to follow are the same. PM reported when a new case opens,\neach parent is provided with a handbook containing the current grievance policy.\nShe stated Complainant would have received the handbook when her previous\nchildren’s case opened, but she might not have received it when Youth A’s case\nopened. On 8/30/2022 I spoke with PM via Microsoft Teams. She confirmed\nComplainant had not received a copy of the parent handbook when Youth A came\ninto care as those are automatically generated when a youth enters foster care and,\nin this case, Youth A was placed directly with dad, so the packet was not\nautomatically generated. PM stated this practice has now been changed so the\npacket gets generated even when a youth is placed in a parent’s home.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nBirth Parent Handbook – On 8/8/2022 I received and reviewed a copy of the Birth\nParent Handbook from PM which includes the steps of the grievance\nprocedure/problem resolution process. The handbook I was provided was not signed\nby Complainant.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06J P. Concerns/ Grievance Process\n2\nThe caseworker must provide a copy of the supervising\nagency's grievance policy to the child, parent, or caregiver,\nwith the DHS5307, at the initial discussion and annually\nthereafter. If a child, parent, or caregiver expresses concern\nabout a child's rights, the caseworker and/or supervisor\nmust assist in resolving those concerns. If a consensus is\nnot reached, the caseworker must assist the child, parent,\nor caregiver in following the agency's grievance procedure.\nIf the agency is unable to resolve the concerns, the child,\nparent, or caregiver can contact the MDHHS Office of\nFamily Advocate at 517-241-9894.\n11",
    "ANALYSIS: Complainant was not provided with the applicable grievance\nprocedure, despite having requested it multiple times.
