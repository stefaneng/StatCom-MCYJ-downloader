    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n During this inspection, it was discovered that the labeling/coding of uploaded\ndocuments was not as consistent as in the past. This lack of consistency\nresulted in it being very difficult to always locate the document that was to be\nreviewed. This issue was discussed with the agency and they agreed to take\naction steps to bring back the level of consistency they have displayed in the\npast.\n One of the CAPs for a licensing file special evaluation did not appear to\nidentify and take action quick enough for a foster parent that had told the\nagency they were “burnt out”. This statement was documented in two other\nreports, but the agency took little more action than trusting that the foster\nparent would request respite help. The youth in care was presenting\nsignificant behavioral issues. This was discussed and the agency’s licensing\nsupervisor agreed to begin evaluating this possible issue with each foster\nhome.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n The personnel files had all of the required documentation present, but the\nfiles were difficult to work through. This was a result of the lack of separation\nof different documents. It was suggested that the agency separate the\ndifferent documents within their specific location in the file.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe first incident involved Special Evaluation Report 2020C0628839. The\nallegations involved the report that the foster father hit the youth’s head against a\nwindow. It was also alleged that the foster father also grabs the youth’s face when\nthe youth is being disciplined. After an in-depth investigation, the family was found to\nbe in non-compliance with rule 9404 Behavior Management and rule 9201 Foster\nparent qualifications. All aspects of the rules for a Special Evaluation were met\nduring the investigation. The corrective action plan involved a requirement that the\nfoster parents complete Trauma Sensitive Discipline training, complete an online\narticle for self-care, development of a self-care plan and make regular contact with\nthe licensing worker to verify compliance. The Licensing worker will also make\nquarterly contact with the family to evaluate compliance with the plan.\n12",
    "The second incident involved Special Evaluation Report 2020C0628372. The\nallegations involved the foster father grabbing the youth by the shirt and picking him\noff the ground. It was also reported that the foster father waived his fist at the youth.\nAfter an in-depth investigation, the family was found to be in non-compliance with\nrule 9201 Foster parent qualifications and rule 9404 Behavior management. All\naspects of the rules for a Special Evaluation were met during the investigation. The\ncorrective action plan involved the foster parents attending a training on behavior\nmanagement and intervention at the Kent Coalition Spring conference. They are\nalso required to attend Trauma Informed Parenting, training on identifying\ntriggers/buttons for foster parents and learn how to respond appropriately.\nCompliance is to be monitored during the monthly visits by the youth’s case\nmanager.\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first corrective action plan was in response to the 2019 Annual Licensing\nInspection Study.\nThe second corrective action plan was in response to Special Investigation\n2020018001 dated 10/23/19. The allegations involved the agency failing to follow\npolicy/procedure when a youth goes AWOL from Independent living placement. The\nagency was found in violation of DHHS-policy 722-03A Absent without legal\npermission. The corrective action plan involved the agency holding an in-service\nregarding the AWOL policy. The agency also developed a check list for AWOL youth\nthat is to be reviewed by all staff. The CAP was approved on 11/4/19.\nThe third corrective action plan was in response to Special Investigation\n2020C0214008, dated 12/30/19. The allegations involved a youth entering care and\nnot receiving the appropriate dental care within the appropriate time frame. The\nagency was found in violation of DHHS-FOM 801 Dental Examination schedule and\na corrective action plan was required. The CAP involved the agency’s support staff\ntracking due dates for all initial youth and ongoing youth’s dental schedule. The\nsupport staff are to follow up with the dental provider the day after a scheduled\nappointment to ensure that treatment was received, and written documentation was\nprovided. The agency will also provide transportation if the foster parents are unable\nto keep a scheduled appointment. The final aspect is that all foster care case\nmanagers are to attend an Inservice training on the requirements for dental care of\nyouth. The CAP was approved on 1/6/20.\nStaff Interviews:\nSeveral different levels of staff were interviewed, and all provided similar statement.\nThey agency believes they are providing best practice to their clients in all situations.\nThe direct care staff feel very supported by the supervisors and administrators and\nall report that the agency has followed the State guidelines for the situation with\n13",

DCWL FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts or concerns during this period under review. The field\nanalyst interviewed/visited nine families, and all indicated being very satisfied with\nthe services being provided by the agency.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy.\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the\nfacility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n8/12/2020\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 12, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n14"
