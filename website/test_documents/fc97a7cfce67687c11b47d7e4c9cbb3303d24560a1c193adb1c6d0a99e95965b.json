The form contains the\nfifteen-minute checks of residents for each of its licenses to include CE630201059,\nwhich includes MP. It is reported that once staff on the unit completes a bed-check\nthey contact the control room through a key-check or call-in who then enters an “X”\non the form as verification of a check being done for that for fifteen-minute period.\nAn “0” means that a check was “Missed”, per the forms key.\n2",
