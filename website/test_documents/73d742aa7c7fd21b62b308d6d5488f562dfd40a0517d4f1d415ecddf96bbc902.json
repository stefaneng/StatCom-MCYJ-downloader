    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Behavior management\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4157\nSection (2) At a minimum, the behavior management system shall include\nDescription all of the following:\n(c) Written guidelines for informally resolving minor misbehavior.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 allegedly threw water on Youth A to wake them up in the\nmorning.\nInvestigation On 8/1/24, I left a voicemail for Complainant and Foster Care\nWorker with no return call as of the date of this report.\nOn 8/1/24, I spoke to Administrator. Administrator reported Staff\n1 was seen on camera putting ice on Youth A and a fake, toy\ncockroach on Youth A to get her up in the morning. Administrator\nreported they had placed Staff 1 on leave due to the investigation.\nOn 8/21/24 I interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility. Supervisor 1\nreported Youth A has been struggling with waking up on time and\nhas been refusing to get up with the rest of the group. Supervisor\n1 reported Youth A told her Staff 1 threw ice on her and put a fake\ncockroach on her to wake her up. Supervisor 1 did not mention\nYouth A reporting Staff 1 hit her. Supervisor 1 reported the normal\nwake up procedures are, to turn the lights on, give each youth five\nminutes to start to get up and then redirect them. Supervisor 1\nreported if they don’t wake up, they are to fill out a refusal paper\nletting staff and supervisors know they are refusing to get up.\nSupervisor 1 reported this process is not written anywhere.\nSupervisor 1 reported she did not see this happening and only\nheard about it from Youth A.\nOn 8/21/24, I interviewed Youth A. Youth A reported Staff 1 threw\nice on her and hit her arm on one occasion. She also pulled her\nblanket off of her and placed a fake cockroach on her to get her\nup. Youth A reported this to Supervisor 1.\nStaff 1 did not show up to her interview. On 8/29/24, I spoke to\nStaff 1 on the phone, and she declined an interview. Staff 1 had\nnot been back to work since the alleged incident.\n2",
    "Video Reviewed:\n• I watched the video dated 7/23/24 where Staff 1 allegedly\nthrew ice cubes at Youth A and placed a fake cockroach on\nher. At 6:03am Staff 1 turned the lights on in Youth A’s\nroom. Youth A was lying in bed and had her left arm\noutstretched with her palm cupped upwardly. Staff 1 is\nseen engaging verbally with Youth A. Youth A did not get\nout of bed. Staff 1 placed an ice cube in Youth A’s cupped\nhand. Youth A threw them at Staff 1. Staff 1 left the room\nand came back at 6:05am and placed another ice cube in\nher hand and then left. At 6:06am, Staff 1 came back into\nthe room and took Youth A’s covers off of her. There were\nno other interactions between Staff 1 and Youth A.\n• I watched video for the other dates Staff 1 supervised\nYouth A, dated 7/21/24, 7/22/24, and 7/24/24. There are no\nincidents where Staff 1 placed a cockroach on Youth A.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• There are policies and procedures pertaining to informally\nresolving minor misbehavior, however these do not discuss\nany wake up procedures at the facility.\n• There were no written plans for Youth A to assist staff at\nwake up.\n• Staff 1 personnel file has up to date clearances and\ntrainings. There are no disciplinary actions in the file.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. There is nothing outlined in\nthe rules or policies that addresses Staff 1’s behavior as non-\ncompliant. The agency does not have specific procedures for\nwaking up youth nor did they have a plan for this youth. Staff 1 did\nnot throw ice cubes at Youth A nor was their evidence to validate\na fake cockroach was placed on her.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTechnical assistance was offered that if a youth in the program is\nnot following the treatment process, the agency is to provide\ninstruction and protocol to assist staff in dealing with behaviors\noutside of the normal routine. Individual behavioral plans or\nassessments, and team meetings can be used to outline specific\ninterventions for youth on an individual basis.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n9/24/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
