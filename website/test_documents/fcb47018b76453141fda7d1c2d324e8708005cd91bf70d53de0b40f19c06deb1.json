The Chief Administrator\nindicated the agency faced some barriers that impacted overall compliance. They\nwere without a parenting time/case aide through most of the year which meant\ncase workers were providing a lot of transportation for children and families as well\nas supervising the parenting time. This took away time from direct casework. In\naddition, the agency terminated a caseworker who struggled managing the\nworkload and, as a result, significantly impacted overall compliance. The agency\ncontinues to utilize internal and external supports to monitor cases and ensure\ncompliance. The assessment noted staff have kept the CAP and compliance at\nthe forefront and have worked diligently to serve youth and families. The chief\nadministrator reported confidence the agency will continue to see improvement\nover the next review period.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the agency’s\nfinancial audit.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed via telephone.
