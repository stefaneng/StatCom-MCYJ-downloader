INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff to resident ratio\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nDescription supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval checks\nshall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 10/8/2024 at 7:00pm, Youth A was outside and refused to\ncome back inside the building after dinner. Staff came outside to\ncheck on Youth A every 30 minutes as he remained sitting at a\npicnic table. Third shift checked cameras periodically to see if\nYouth A was still outside. There was not enough staff to go\noutside and check on Youth A. At 5:30am a staff went out to\ncheck on Youth A and he was gone. Staff did not complete\nvariable interval eyes-on checks over night for Youth A.\nInvestigation Administrator and Case Manager Supervisor were\ninterviewed face-to-face at the facility on 10/10/2024. Both\nreported knowing about the allegations but having no firsthand\ninformation. They stated being informed that Youth A was sitting\noutside at a table with other youth during dinner and refused to re-\nenter the facility when the group went back inside after dinner.\nBoth reported staff were informed by Supervisor that they were to\nmonitor Youth A as best as they could. The also reported at\n5:30AM staff went outside to talk with Youth A but were unable to\nfind Youth A. Administrator was unsure of the policy ratio of staff\nto youth. They also reported Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, and\nStaff 5 took half the youth upstairs around 8:00 PM and the other\nstaff who they could not recall stayed in the dining room/kitchen\narea to monitor the remaining youth cleaning up the area. This last\nstaff (unidentified) and youth left the area shortly, thereafter,\nleaving Youth A alone outside. They reported being informed by\nstaff (unidentified) that every 30-minutes staff would go outside to\nask Youth A to come back into the facility, but Youth A continued\nto refuse. At 11:00 PM second shift ended and there were only\nStaff 5 and Staff 6 working third shift. At first, Staff 5 and Staff 6\nasked Youth A to come back inside but again Youth A refused.\nStaff 5 and Staff 6 reported they came outside to check on Youth\nA even though, they had 16 other youth in the building, they were\nsupervising.\n2",
    "Youth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n10/10/2024. Youth A reported eating dinner outside of the dining\nroom with other youth present. Youth A reported moving to a table\nnear the volleyball courts around 7:30PM with the other youth and\nstaff. Sometime after this the other youth went inside with staff\nand Youth A informed staff but could not recall who, Youth A was\nnot coming. Youth A reported being upset and crying at the time.\nYouth A reported missing Youth A’s family as a reason for Youth\nA being upset. Youth A reported staff never questioned Youth A’s\ncrying and only checked on Youth A from a distance. Youth A\ndidn’t know the time and was unsure if second shift staff checked\non Youth A. Youth A denied third shift staff ever check on Youth\nA. Youth A reported sitting behind a tree near the volleyball court\nbecause Youth A was cold, and this shielded Youth A from the\nwind. Youth A believed that sometime between 6:00AM and\n7:00AM Case Manager Supervisor came outside and took Youth\nA back into the facility. Youth A reported not being sure if Youth A\nis safe at the facility because Youth A is being moved to different\nfacilities quite often.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 10/23/2024. She reported\nworking at the facility the day of the incident and began her shift in\nthe morning. She reported being asked to work over until 8:00PM\nbecause an afternoon staff had “called off” and extra staff were\nneeded. Staff 1 reported she was watching the youth during\ndinner and Youth A went into the parking lot and sat down. She\nreported the other youth began playing football and when looking\nfor Youth A, Youth A had “just disappeared”. She told another staff\nwho she could not recall which staff and went back to the spot\nwhere she was sitting. She reported being told by another youth\nwho she could not recall which youth, that Youth A went into the\nbushes behind the volleyball court. She reported being able to see\npart of Youth A’s jacket, so she and Staff 2 walked over to Youth\nA and asked Youth A what Youth A was doing. She reported\nYouth A only said Youth A was “ok” and didn’t want to go inside.\nThey left Youth A there and went back inside. She reported going\nback outside around 8-8:30PM and having Youth A continue to\nrefuse to respond to her questions. Staff 2 told her the next\nmorning that staff looked for Youth A but were unable to find him.\nShe reported Supervisor informed staff through text messages,\nthat they were not to chase Youth A because the facility was short\nstaffed at the time. She reported prior to leaving work, she\nobserved Youth A outside without supervision by staff for 40-45\nminutes. She believed staff checked on Youth A every 20 minutes\nbecause Staff 2 told her so. When returning to work the next\n3",
    "morning she was surprised to see Youth A speaking with Case\nManager Supervisor inside. Staff 1 did not report checking on\nYouth A during the evening.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 10/23/2024. She reported\nworking second shift the day of the incident and was unsure of\nwhat occurred for Youth A to refuse to reenter the building. She\nreported Youth A has a history of being unpredictable when Youth\nA is angry and will refuse to reenter the building. Staff 3 reported\nchecking on Youth A a “couple of times” during the shift and\nhaving Youth A tell her each time Youth A was alright and didn’t\nwant to reenter the building. She was unable to recall the specific\ntimes she checked on Youth A but believed it could have been 2-3\ntimes. She reported she would check the video monitors at times\nand look out of the window at other times. She reported rotating\nwith Staff 1, Staff 3, Staff 4, and Staff 5 to check on Youth A. She\nwas unsure if any written logs were completed and had contact\nwith Supervisor. Supervisor informed Staff 3 to check on Youth A\nand convince Youth A to come inside. She reported Youth A was\nin the same spot until she left work at 11PM.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 10/23/2024. She reported\nworking second shift the day of the incident. She reported Youth A\nwas outside and didn’t want to come inside. She reported this is\nnot the first time Youth A has refused to return to the building. She\nreported there were 16 or 17 youth in the program at the time with\nonly 4 staff after 8PM so staff needed to stay in ratio with the other\nyouth. Staff had other duties such as discharge paperwork,\nchores, and phone calls for youth. Staff 4 also reported the staff\nleft Youth A outside unattended, only checking on Youth A when\nthey were able to find Youth A randomly. She reported Supervisor\ntold her staff should leave Youth A and go upstairs with the other\nyouth and check on Youth A every half hour. She reported\nchecking on Youth A three times. She did not know if there was\nwritten documentation of checks being completed on Youth A at\nthis time. When she left work at 11PM Youth A was still outside.\nShe reported normally bed checks need to occur no more than\nevery 15-minutes.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 10/23/2024. She reported\nworking second shift on the day of the incident and stated Youth A\nwas refusing to enter the building as reported earlier by other staff.\nShe reported there were only 4 staff present and 17 youth to\nsupervise so staff had to be inside to pass medication, do chores,\nphone calls, and paperwork. She reported staff continued to check\non Youth A every half hour and would continue to ask Youth A to\n4",
    "come inside. She reported only checking on Youth A at 10:45PM\nbut believed other staff checked on Youth A more often. She\nreported overhearing Supervisor tell staff they should check on\nYouth A every half hour. She reported there is a video monitor on\nthe floor so staff could look to see if Youth A came back to the\nbuilding. When she left at 11PM she “caught” site of Youth A in\nthe same spot (sitting behind a tree near the volleyball court) but\ndidn’t walk over and speak with Youth A.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 10/24/2024. He reported\nworking second shift the evening of the incident. He reported\naround 7PM the youth would go downstairs for dinner and at this\ntime Youth A put on headphones while watching other youth play\nfootball. When the youth came back inside, Staff 2 noticed Youth\nA was missing from the group. An unidentified coworker as Staff 2\ncould not remember the staff told Staff 2 that Youth A walked\ntowards the volleyball court. Staff 2 went to the volleyball court\nand found Youth A sitting in the woods near the court. Staff 2\nreported telling Youth A it was time to go inside and begin\ncleaning the dining room and kitchen. Youth A refused so Staff 2\nleft him and called Supervisor. Staff 2 reported Supervisor\ninformed Staff 2 that there were not enough staff working at the\ntime so they could leave Youth A outside and check on Youth A\nevery 25-30 minutes. Supervisor told Staff 2 that staff could check\nthe video monitor to see if Youth A shows up and then let Youth A\nin the building. Staff 2 reported staff checked on Youth A every\n30-minutes, but Youth A continued to refuse to return to the\nbuilding. Staff 2 reported Case Manager Supervisor was\ncontacted and attempted to speak to Youth A by phone, but Youth\nA refused to speak. This is reported to have occurred around\n10:45PM. Staff 2 reported the checks were not documented but a\ntext message was sent to Supervisor every time a check on Youth\nA was made. Staff 2 reported when leaving, he observed Youth A\nin the same spot.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via phone on 10/24/2024. He reported\nworking third shift the night of the incident and when coming on\nshift the second shift staff (unable to recall the name of the staff)\ninformed him to call Supervisor because Youth A was refusing to\ncome inside. Staff 6 reported Staff 7 called Supervisor and\nSupervisor informed them to watch the video monitor to see if\nYouth A comes back to the building. Supervisor told staff to watch\nthe video monitor every 20 minutes which Staff 6 didn’t like. Staff\n6 reported not liking these directions and went outside once to\ncheck on Youth A but was unable to find Youth A. He reported\nStaff 7 went outside once but also could not find Youth A.\n5",
    "Supervisor then told the two staff not to go outside because of the\nratio and to just check the video monitor. Staff 6 also reported\nStaff 7 told Staff 6 they were not to check outside because they\nhad youth to supervise in the building. Staff 6 also reported Staff 7\ncalled Supervisor and Staff 7 passed the information from\nSupervisor along to Staff 6. He reported there was no staff outside\nwith Youth A when he arrived for his shift. Staff 6 reported Youth A\ncame inside around 7:30AM with Case Manager Supervisor.\nStaff 7 was interviewed via phone on 11/25/2024. He reported\nhe remembers the incident with Youth A and worker. He reported\nbeing told by Staff 4 and Staff 5 of the situation with Youth A and\nYouth A refusal to reenter the building. Staff 4 and Staff 5 reported\nto have told Staff 7 that Supervisor will call them with directions on\nhow to handle the situation. Rather than wait, Staff 7 reported\ncalling Supervisor and being told that Staff 6 and Staff 7 need to\nstay in the building and supervisor the other youth because if they\nleft, they would be out of ratio. He reported being told by\nSupervisor to check the camera every 30-40 minutes and\ndocument what they observed in the shift log. He described the\nshift log like a “room check log”. Staff 7 reported telling Supervisor\nthat he was unable to see clearly in the camera view and could\nonly make out shadows because of the weather and lack of light.\nAt one point, Staff 7 went outside and attempted to find Youth A\nbut was unsuccessful. After returning to the building, Staff 7\ninformed Staff 6 who then went outside but was also unsuccessful\nin locating Youth A. Staff 7 reported this occurred around 4:00am\nand he called Supervisor to inform Supervisor that they were\nunable to locate Youth A. Staff 7 reported not being aware of the\nlocation of the log he documented camera checks on but that he\ndid document when going outside to look for Youth A. Staff 7\nreported having numerous chores to do. Overall, Staff 7 reported\nhaving only 2 phone calls with Supervisor.\nSupervisor was interviewed via phone on 10/24/2024. He\nreported receiving a phone call from Staff 2 at 7:45PM informing\nhim that Youth A was refusing to come back inside the building.\nThe youth had finished dinner and were engaged in doing chores\nbefore going back upstairs to get ready for bed. Supervisor\nreported asking Staff 2 if Youth A was escalated and what was the\nreason for Youth A’s refusal to come inside. Staff 2 informed\nSupervisor that Youth A was calm and listening to music but\nrefused to speak or acknowledge anyone. Supervisor was told\nYouth A was sitting at a picnic table far away from the cafeteria\nand since it was dark at the time, staff couldn’t see Youth A unless\nthey went to the area. Supervisor reported asking staff (unable to\n6",
    "recall which staff) if someone could sit in the cafeteria and watch\nYouth A but was informed it was too dark to see Youth A from the\ncafeteria. Supervisor knew they had limited staff at the time, so he\ninstructed staff to check on Youth A every 30-minutes because\nsafety and care for the other youth was primary. Supervisor\nreported the facility has a ratio of 1:6 during the day and 1:12\nduring sleeping hours. Because two second shift staff called in\nsick, he had Staff 1 stay until 8PM. There were 17 youth present\nat the time and 4 staff on second shift and 2 staff on third shift\nleaving no extra staff to check on Youth A after Staff 1 left at 8PM.\nSupervisor reported telling staff that if Youth A moves or\nsomething changes, they were to call Supervisor. Supervisor\nreported telling Staff 2 to document the check in the observation\nlogs as well as texting Supervisor. Supervisor reported receiving\ntext messages every half hour and will provide these text\nmessages. He reported speaking to Clinician who agreed to\nfacilitate a phone call with Youth A. Supervisor reported writing an\nincident report on 10/10/24 and notifying ORR on 10/9/24 of the\nAWOL of Youth A.\nClinician was interviewed via phone on 11/5/2024. She\nreported being informed by Supervisor of the situation with Youth\nA refusing to return to the building. She also reported informing\nstaff (unable to recall which staff) that she should be notified if\nYouth A leaves the area but did want to give Youth A some alone\ntime outside because Youth A likes to spend time outside. She\nreported this contact with the facility occurred around 10 to\n10:30PM and she was thinking of driving to the facility but chose\nto make a video call with Youth A. Youth A refused to speak with\nClinician on the video call. She reported making the decision not\nto drive in because staff (unable to recall which staff) told her the\nvideo call was the best option. Clinician reported having no more\ncontact with staff at the facility the rest of the night after the failed\nvideo call. She reported believing staff were checking on Youth A\nevery 10-15 minutes and was surprised to learn staff were\ninformed to only check on Youth A every 30-minutes.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nBethany Christian services Transitional Assessment Center\nTransitional Living Center Policies & Procedures – Staff to\nResident Policy dated 8/3/2023. It is documented that if youth\nare out of the direct supervision of staff, staff shall perform\nvariable interval, eye-on checks of the youth not to exceed 15-\nminutes. This document also states that during awake hours there\n7",
    "should be one staff for every eight youth and during overnight\nhours there should be one staff for every sixteen youth.\nCommunication log (text) between on-call staff and staff at\nthe facility on 10/8/24 regarding Youth A staying outside.\nThese messages only involve the following staff: Supervisor, Case\nManager Supervisor, and Staff 7. No other staff are identified as\nbeing involved in this stream of messages. There is also no\ndocumentation of any checks being made on Youth A throughout\nthese messages. Supervisor notes he will not have staff to check\non youth.\nBridgeway Transitional Assessment Center Client\nObservation Log dated 10/8/24. This documents checks are\nbeing completed at times where there are not varying intervals\nand multiple times exceeding 15 minutes when youth are asleep\nor otherwise outside the line of sight of staff.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance as based on interviews\nwith staff and written documentation staff did not provide the\nrequired supervision of Youth A while Youth A was out of the line\nof sight. Even though, the facility had enough staff on duty during\nsecond shift at the time of this incident, Supervisor instructed staff\nto focus on the youth in the building rather than provide a staff for\nthe supervision of Youth A. The facility’s policy on staff to youth\nstates the ratio is to be 1 staff for 8 youth during waking hours and\nduring second shift there were 4 staff on duty for 16 or 17 youth\nwhich is a ratio of 4.25 youth per staff. Therefor, 3 staff could have\nprovided supervision within ratio allowing the 4th staff to supervise\nYouth A. Additionally, the room check log supports that the facility\nis not engaging in variable random room checks not exceeding 15\nminutes.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding the duties of staff\nwhen supervising youth. It appears as reported by some of the\nstaff interviewed that staff have numerous duties to conduct while\nalso providing supervision to the youth. It is recommended that\nstaff are trained and understand that their primary duty is the\nsupervision of youth above any other duties. Only after\nappropriate supervision is completed should staff engage in other\nduties. If the duties are required to be completed during the time\nstaff are to also supervise, then the facility needs to increase the\nnumber of staff working the shift so there is no gap in the\nsupervision required.\n8",
    "Technical assistance was offered regarding the duties of on-call\nstaff. It is recommended that as a part of the on-call staff’s duties\nis the requirement of coming to the facility to present a physical\npresence to ensure the appropriate supervision is being applied.\nBeing on site will also add support to the staff working and help in\nresolving any issues without question.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Incident reporting\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4150\nSection (3) If an institution determines that a youth is absent without legal\nDescription permission, then the institution shall immediately report the\ninformation to law enforcement, the parent/legal guardian or next\nof kin, the licensing authority, and the referring agency.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Facility failed to notify licensing about Youth A going AWOL until 2\ndays after the incident.\nInvestigation Case Manager Supervisor were interviewed face-to-face at\nthe facility on 10/10/2024. Case Manager Supervisor reported\nthat she was in the process of notifying the licensing consultant of\nthe AWOL but had yet to inform the licensing consultant. She\nreported beginning the AWOL process at 5:30AM of 10/10/24\nwhen being informed of Youth A being AWOL on 10/8/2024.\nCase Manager Supervisor was interviewed again via phone\non 11/4/2024. She reported becoming involved around 5:45AM\nwhen Supervisor called her to inform her that staff were unable to\nlocate Youth A, so Case Manager Supervisor began the AWOL\nprocess at that time. She called Law Enforcement and Supervisor\nwas to call the other required numbers.\nLicensing Consultant was interviewed via phone on\n11/12/2024. She reported being notified by email of Youth A’s\nAWOL statues on 10/10/24 at 12:16 pm.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nBethany Christian services Transitional Assessment Center\nTransitional Living Center Policies & Procedures -\nAWOL/Runaway Procedure Policy dated 9/16/24. This\ndocument outlines the procedure for the prevention of a runaway\nsituation. It is documented that if a youth has been identified with\nthe potential to run away after-hours, on-call is to be notified\n9",
    "immediately. A face-to-face intervention should occur and is to be\nconducted by either the on-call worker or the program therapist, or\nan on-shift staff with the assistance of the on-call worker, to\nassess the safety of the youth. It is documented that after hours,\non-call and shift supervisor are to coordinate the response to\nAWOL and the Clinician or on-call clinician should conduct the\nAWOL Risk Assessment to determine flight risk and safety plan\naccordingly. Once confirming the youth is AWOL, the response\nteam notify State Licensing. This document states that if the youth\nis a UC youth, then the AWOL process does not begin until the\nyouth doesn’t return for 4-hours.\nAWOL Risk Assessment dated 10/8/2024 for Youth A. This\ndocument outlines that Clinician assessed Youth A for being an\nAWOL risk assessment. It is documented Youth A informed\nClinician Youth A was not planning on going AWOL and Youth A\nrefused to respond to any further questions.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance as based on interviews\nwith Case Manager Supervisor, Licensing Consultant and written\ndocumentation the Licensing Consultant was not notified of Youth\nA’s AWOL statues until 2-days after the incident.\nTechnical Assistance\nTechnical assistance was offered to update policy as 4 hours is\ntoo long to wait to consider a youth AWOL as staff need to check\non them in varying intervals not to exceed 15 minutes.\nConclusion Violation Established\n10",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
