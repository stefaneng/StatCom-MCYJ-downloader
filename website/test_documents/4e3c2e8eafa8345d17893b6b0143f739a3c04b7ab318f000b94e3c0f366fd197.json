    "Section perform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nDescription rules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff gave youth the keys to unlock their door. The door to the\ncontrol station of the unit is often left unlocked and opened. Staff\nwill often leave youth on the unit unsupervised.\nAdditional allegations were provided during an interview with\nYouth A on 8/8/24:\nOn 8/5/24, Youth A was in an altercation with another youth, and\nno staff intervened.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 8/6/24.\nComplainant did not have any additional information surrounding\nthe allegations.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 8/8/24. CA reported she didn’t hear about a situation\nregarding Staff 1 giving Youth A her keys during a shift. CA\nreported the door to the control room on the pod automatically\nshuts and locks, but staff must ensure it latches. CA reported on\n8/5/24, Youth A and other youth on the pod got into a physical\naltercation, but Youth A was not knocked out. CA reported Youth\nA was assessed by medical afterwards, and there were no follow-\nup concerns.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/8/24.\nYouth A reported one day last week (couldn’t remember when),\nStaff 1 gave him her keys because he asked her to unlock his\ndoor and Staff 4 did not have keys to do so. Youth A reported\nStaff 4 was at the door to the control room and Staff 1 was seated\nat the table on the pod when it occurred.\nYouth A reported the control room door doesn’t shut automatically,\nso staff are always leaving it open and unattended. Youth A could\nnot provide any specific details regarding times of day, dates, or\nstaff involved. Youth A reported there are times when youth are\nunsupervised on the pod completely, but it mostly happens when\nstaff go into the control room and there are no staff on the pod.\nYouth A reported a lot of things could happen to youth (i.e. self-\nharm, physical altercations, etc.) when staff go into the control\nroom and leave the pod unattended. Youth A reported although\nnothing has happened yet, the possibility of it makes him feel\nuncomfortable and unsafe.\n2",
    "Youth A reported on 8/5/24, Youth B, Youth C, and Youth D were\nall fighting him because he was putting food and water into the\nwall speaker on the pod because he was angry. Youth A reported\nthey hit him so hard, he got knocked out and everything went\nblack. Youth A reported he got lumps on his head and couldn’t\nmove. Youth A reported Staff 3 was the only staff present on the\nunit, and she was just sitting down watching it happen. Youth A\nreported Staff 3 did not intervene in the fight or say “stop”, and\ninstead, encouraged it and said, “go get him”. Youth A reported he\nthinks there should always be two staff on each pod, but a lot of\ntimes there’s only one staff present.\nAn attempt was made to interview Youth B face to face at the\nfacility on 8/8/24, but he refused to talk or provide any\ninformation.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/8/24.\nYouth C reported he wasn’t present for the altercation between\nYouth A and Youth B on 8/5/24 because he was in his room at the\ntime. Youth C reported he heard Staff 3 call for back-up on the\nwalkie-talkie. Youth C reported he also heard Staff 3 yelling, “stop,\nstop, leave him alone”, and heard her tell the other youth not to\nget involved. Youth C reported the control room door is never left\nopen and unattended. Youth C reported the control room door\nshuts mostly on its own, but then staff must ensure its latched\nclosed before it automatically locks. Youth C reported youth are\nnever left on the pod unsupervised. Youth C reported he has\nnever seen any staff give their keys to any youth.\nYouth D was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/8/24.\nYouth D reported he thinks the ratio for staff to youth is 1:4 or 1:5.\nYouth D reported they have eight youth on the pod, and during the\nmorning shift they consistently have two staff, but in the\nafternoon/evening shifts, they sometimes only have one staff.\nYouth D reported there are a lot of problems with the youth on the\npod, so a lot of staff don’t want to work on the pod, which leaves\nthem short staffed. Youth D reported the only time he would\nconsider the pod to be unsupervised is when there’s only one staff\nworking, and the staff goes into the control room to get something.\nYouth D reported the control room door is never left open or\nunattended unless a staff is in the control room or in the doorway\nto the control room getting something quickly. Youth D reported\none day (couldn’t remember when), a staff (couldn’t remember\nwho) entered the control room to get water for a youth, and when\nthey exited, Youth A pushed past the staff to enter the control\n3",
    "room. Youth D reported the staff immediately escorted Youth A\nout of the control room.\nYouth D reported he was present when Youth A asked Staff 1 for\nher staff keys. Youth D reported Staff 1 wasn’t looking at who\nasked for the keys, had her finger through the key ring, and went\nto hand her keys to Youth A. However, Youth D reported Staff 1\nrealized she was handing her keys to Youth A at the last minute,\nand immediately snatched them back away from him. Youth D\nreported Youth A said, “I was just trying to help because Staff 4\nasked for the keys to let Youth B in his room”. Youth D reported\nYouth A clearly wasn’t trying to help and was just looking for an\nopportunity to intercept the keys.\nYouth D reported on 8/5/24, a fight occurred between Youth A and\nYouth B, and the only staff present at the time was Staff 3. Youth\nD reported Youth A was antagonizing everyone on the unit. Youth\nD reported Youth A threw a chair up at the ceiling, and when it\ndropped, Youth B took the chair away so Youth A couldn’t do it\nagain. Youth A was mad Youth B took the chair away, so he\nkicked Youth B in the leg. Youth A then threw his food and juice all\nover the pod, causing a big mess. Youth D reported Youth A was\nalso smashing food, toothpaste, and liquid into the speakers on\nthe wall. Youth D reported he tried to de-escalate the situation as\na peer mentor by verbal encouragement, but Youth A wouldn’t\nlisten. Youth D reported Youth A took a marker and drew all over\nthe walls, doors, etc. Youth D reported when Youth A got to Youth\nB’s door and started drawing on it, Youth B became really upset.\nYouth D reported Youth A attempted to physically assault Youth\nB, and then Youth B retaliated by hitting Youth A approximately\nfive times before the fight was broken up. Youth D reported Staff 3\nis older and moves a little slower, but she got up and tried to\nintervene as soon as she could.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/8/24.\nStaff 1 reported her memory is terrible, but she knows for a fact\nshe never gave her keys to Youth A. Staff 1 reported she doesn’t\nremember Youth A asking for her keys or even trying to take her\nkeys. Staff 1 reported on 8/7/24, Youth A talked to her about her\ngiving him her keys and told her she gave him the keys because\nshe was in a rush. Staff 1 reported she was confused because\nshe didn’t remember anything like that happening. Staff 1 reported\nshe didn’t remember a situation happening as Youth D outlined in\nhis interview either. Staff 1 reported if a youth asked her to open\nhis room, she would have done it herself and not tried to pass the\ntask onto another staff.\n4",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed via phone on 9/5/24. Staff 2 reported he\nhas never seen the control room door left open and unlocked, and\nhe has never seen the youth on the unit unsupervised.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 9/10/24. Staff 3 reported if\nthere is only one staff on the unit, and that staff must go into the\ncontrol room to get something, the youth on the pod are\ntechnically unsupervised because the staff is in a different room\nthan the youth. Staff 3 reported until about 1-2 weeks ago, she\nworked on the pod alone often, and she would go into the control\nroom quickly if she needed to get things for youth. Staff 3 reported\nthe youth tend to swarm the control room when a staff is in there\nand the staff don’t shut the door when they’re in the control room\nor in the doorway, especially if there’s only one staff working at the\ntime. Staff 3 reported it is not a great process, and if a staff is\nworking alone, they should try to avoid going into the control room\nas much as possible for the sake of safety of the youth.\nStaff 3 reported on 8/5/24, Youth A dumped his lunch and drink all\nover the unit, and then began drawing on the pod doors with a\nmarker. Staff 3 reported Youth A and Youth B then got into a\nphysical altercation. Staff 3 reported she was working alone, so\nshe called for staff backup over the walkie-talkie. Staff 3 reported\nshe remembers Youth A being the aggressor towards Youth B\nand does not remember Youth B punching Youth A multiple times.\nStaff 3 reported when the altercation began, she got up from her\nchair and said, “stop guys”, and walked over to intervene. When\nStaff 3 was informed the video footage does not show her\nintervening and does not show Youth A being the aggressor, she\ncontinued to state the video is not how she remembered the\nsituation occurring. Staff 3 reported when there are two staff\npresent on the pod, typically one staff would try to de-escalate the\nsituation while the other staff put the other youth in their rooms to\nhelp with the de-escalation. Staff 3 reported since she was\nworking alone, she did not feel comfortable physically intervening,\nand she felt it was impossible to physically intervene without\nadditional consequences (i.e. restraining one youth, but the other\nyouth continuing to fight or Staff 3 getting in between the two\nyouth, and getting physically injured by the youth). Staff 3 reported\nshe did her best to de-escalate the situation, and then waited for\nback-up to arrive. Staff 3 reported she believes there should\nalways be at least two staff working on every pod.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 9/5/24. Staff 4 reported\nwhen staff are working, they normally share a set of keys because\n5",
    "they don’t have enough keys for all staff. Staff 4 reported one day\nin the last month or so (couldn’t remember when), Youth A came\nto her on the pod, handed her a set of staff keys and said, “Here’s\na set of keys, and because I like you, I’m going to give them to\nyou”. Staff 4 reported she was very upset because no youth on\nthe pod should have staff keys. Staff 4 reported she took the keys\nfrom Youth A and said, “why do you have these?”. Staff 4 reported\nshe didn’t see a staff pass the keys to Youth A, but Youth A told\nher Staff 1 gave him her keys. Staff 4 reported she talked to Staff\n1 after the incident and told her she shouldn’t have given Youth A\nher keys. Staff 4 reported Staff 1 did not provide any explanation\nor take responsibility for her actions. Staff 4 reported Staff 1\nsimply stuttered a bit, acted appalled and looked like she was\n“caught”. Staff 4 reported she told Supervisor about the incident\nafter it occurred. Staff 4 reported she hasn’t heard or seen any\nissues regarding the control room door being left open, or youth\nbeing unsupervised on the pod.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 9/9/24. Staff 5 reported\nshe has seen the control room door left open and the pod left\nunsupervised on multiple occasions, but she was unable to\nprovide specific details on dates, times, or staff involved. Staff 5\nreported there have been times when they are short staff where\nshe has had to go into the control room to get a youth’s property\nbox. Staff 5 reported being short staffed around shower time and\ngetting the youths’ hygiene boxes from the control room is\nespecially difficult. Staff 5 reported when she is the only staff\nworking, but is in the control room, technically there are no staff on\nthe pod, which leaves the youth unsupervised. Staff 5 reported the\npod is not in direct line of sight, but staff can still see youth from\nthe control room. Staff 5 reported for safety of the youth, and\naccording to facility policy, they’re supposed to always be in line of\nsight.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via phone on 9/5/24. Staff 6 reported\nthere are usually two staff working each shift, so the youth are\nnever left unsupervised. Staff 6 reported the control room door is\nnot supposed to be left open because there are items in there the\nyouth cannot have without permission (i.e. snacks, phones, writing\nutensils, food, access to the adjoining pod, etc.). Staff 6 reported\nthe only time the control room door might be left open is when a\nstaff is in the control room doorway getting something out of the\ncontrol room for a youth.\nSupervisor was interviewed via phone on 9/9/24. Supervisor\nreported the information regarding Youth A having a staff’s keys\n6",
    "was passed onto him in passing by Staff 4. Supervisor admitted\nhe didn’t fully understand the situation Staff 4 presented to him\nand didn’t ask additional questions as he was busy with more\npressing emergencies at the facility. Supervisor admitted he did\nnot follow-up afterwards to learn more about what happened, and\nhe did not have a conversation with Staff 1 surrounding the\nsituation. Supervisor reported he hasn’t seen or heard of any\nissues with the control room door being open or staff leaving youth\nunsupervised on the pod.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 8/5/24 was reviewed. Youth A is seen on the\npod with a marker in his hand, drawing on a door on the pod. He\nexchanges words with someone off camera. Youth B enters the\ncamera frame and approaches Youth A. Youth B says, “I’m not\ngonna just let you do that bro”. Youth A faces Youth B, holding the\nmarker in one hand and puts his other arm up in a defensive\nposition. Youth B gets closer to Youth A and punches him 15\ntimes, mostly hitting Youth A on his back and back of his head.\nAfter Youth B punches Youth A, Youth B backs off, and then a\nfemale staff is heard on the walkie-talkie requesting for security\nback-up. Two other youth are on the sidelines watching, but do\nnot engage in the altercation. No staff are present on the video\nintervening in the altercation. No staff are heard telling Youth B to\nstop or attempting to de-escalate the situation.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Youth Discipline and Behavior Modification Policy states\nphysical management procedures are an appropriate staff\nresponse and justified to separate youth in a physical fight.\n• The facility does not have a policy regarding staff keys.\n• Statement of Youth and Family Rights states a youth has\nthe right to receive appropriate adult supervision, support,\nand guidance.\n• Youth Supervision policy states proper supervision of youth\nis necessary to ensure youth and staff safety and to\nprevent escape. Staff are always responsible for the\nsupervision and ongoing safety and security of youth.\nYouth may never be left unattended or unsupervised by\nstaff. Staff may never do anything to jeopardize the safety,\ncare, or welfare of youth. Staff shall maintain within\ncontinuous “line-of-sight supervision” when youth are\noutside of their rooms. Line-of-sight supervision is defined\n7",
    "as “coordinating activities of the residents, under your\nsupervision, so visible contact is maintained, and the\nactions of the residents are always under observation.”\nStaff shall monitor youth closely to assess the need for de-\nescalation and/or the agency’s therapeutic crisis\nintervention model.\n• Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary actions in her\nemployee file. Staff 1 completed training regarding\nappropriate use of staff keys during orientation on 6/28/24\nand 7/3/24.\n• Staff 3 has 50 disciplinary action plans in her employee file;\n45 of which are unrelated to concerns in this investigation.\nHowever, 5 disciplinary actions contain similar concerns as\nthis investigation:\no Sept. 2018 – Staff 3 failed to abide by safety\nrules/policies by going into the control room when a\nyouth was “off focus”, which resulted in the youth\nattacking a peer. Staff 3 failed to assist a coworker\nduring the incident, so the youth also attacked the\ncoworker. Staff 3 failed to intervene to assist her\ncoworker.\no March 2018 – Staff 3 failed to maintain line of sight\nsupervision on youth and didn’t intervene\nappropriately during a youth’s assault on a peer.\no July 2017 – Staff 3 failed to intervene in 3 youth\nassaulting a peer.\no March 2005 & February 2007 – Failed to maintain\n“line-of-sight” supervision of youth.\nStaff 3 received Crisis Intervention – Verbal De-escalation\ntraining on 2/15/24, Crisis Intervention – Handle with Care\nPhysical Practicum on 3/14/24, Child Management\nTechniques/Discipline Techniques on 5/16/24, and Youth\nSupervision departmental training on 1/5/24 & 5/22/24.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per staff and youth\ninterviews, video reviewed, and documentation reviewed, Staff 3\ndid not intervene using physical management or verbal de-\nescalation when Youth B physically assaulted Youth A. Staff 3 did\nnot call for security back-up until after the altercation was over.\nIn addition, based on youth and staff interviews, staff have failed\nto comply with “line-of-sight” supervision policy requirements when\ngoing into the control room while working alone.\n8",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was provided to the facility to address staff\nkeys in a new or existing policy to ensure staff understand the\nrequirements surrounding their possession and use. Also, the\nfacility should consider having two staff always working on each\npod to ensure safety of staff and youth.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2023C0000468 dated 6/28/23; CAP approved 8/15/23\nSIR #2023C0000424 dated 6/7/23; CAP approved 7/10/23\nSIR #2023C0000450 dated 6/7/23; CAP approved 7/5/23\nRule Code CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle & (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nSection policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nDescription intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff pulled Youth A by his shirt and around his waist to stop him\nfrom exiting the pod.\nInvestigation VIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 8/5/24 was reviewed.
