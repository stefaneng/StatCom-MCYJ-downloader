In addition, agency caseworker made inappropriate\ncomments to youth regarding what may happen if he were to go to\ndetention or prison.\nInvestigation Hannahville Indian Community Tribal Probation Officer (HIC\nTribal PO) was interviewed via telephone on March 18, 2025.\nShe stated she attended a Team Decision Making (TDM) meeting\non March 4, 2025, regarding Youth A. The purpose of the meeting\nwas to discuss placement options. Youth A is currently in relative\nplacement with his grandparents, and they have asked for him to\nbe moved. She felt during the meeting Private Agency Foster\nCare Foster Care Worker (PAFC FCW) and DHS staff were trying\nto have Youth A placed in a residential detention through his\nprobation. She felt the group was trying to influence her to violate\nhis probation and place him through probation.\nHIC Tribal PO stated she has been Youth A’s assigned probation\nofficer since October 2024. She reported Youth A has had\nprobation violations for having nicotine vapes and THC vapes and\ntesting positive for marijuana. The scoring on her assessment\nindicates Youth A would benefit from community-based services\nsuch as outpatient and in-home services, therefore she does not\nfeel residential is an appropriate option at this time. She stated\nYouth A has gone through a lot and some recent changes have\nupset him. His younger brother was moved from the same relative\nhome to a different home in another area, his older brother went to\njail, and his biological parents are in and out of his life. She stated\nshe feels Youth A has a lot of strengths and is hopeful he can\nremain in the community and other community-based services be\nconsidered.\nHIC Tribal PO said PAFC FCW and Department of Health and\nHuman Services Purchase of Service Foster Care supervisor\n(DHHS POS FC supervisor) were questioning probation during the\nTDM, and she had to put her foot down. She indicated Youth A\n2",
    "has active consequences through probation that are being\nfollowed through with. She had the impression the amount of\nquestioning toward probation was an attempt to have her place\nYouth A in detention. HIC Tribal PO reported PAFC FCW was\ninformed HIC Tribal PO felt the communication during the TDM\nwas inappropriate and HIC Tribal PO felt cornered. PAFC FCW\ncontacted her and apologized and asked what remarks she felt\nwere upsetting. HIC Tribal PO reported to PAFC FCW that she felt\nYouth A had consequences through probation and stated she felt\nresidential was not an appropriate fit for him and didn’t think he\nwould even meet criteria for residential or detention.\nHIC Tribal PO was asked about the other allegations within the\ncomplaint regarding inappropriate comments by PAFC FCW\ntoward Youth A. She stated during a phone call prior to the TDM\non March 4, 2025, PAFC FCW reported to her and Hannahville\nIndian Community Social Services Director (HIC SS Director) that\nwhile she was speaking to Youth A she told him he wouldn’t last in\nprison because he’s too cute and there will be 5 guys on you.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Team Decision\nMaking Facilitator (DHHS TDM Facilitator) was interviewed via\nTeams on March 19, 2025. He stated he was the TDM Facilitator\nfor a TDM held on March 4, 2025. Youth A is currently placed with\ngrandparents, and they have indicated they are no longer willing\nto care for him due to his behaviors and the intention of the TDM\nwas to discuss placement options. DHHS TDM Facilitator did not\nfeel there was any bullying during the meeting. He felt things were\nbrought up in a straight to the point manner. Youth A has some\nbehavior challenges and there are not a lot of placement options\nfor him in the area. He felt PAFC FCW was straight to the point in\nstating they don’t have a lot of options for him due to the not\nhaving homes that could meet his needs or be willing to accept\nplacement. He stated the meeting was matter of fact, but he didn’t\nfeel it was contentious or heated. Overall, the concerns were\nregarding Youth A’s incorrigibility or delinquency behaviors. If\nYouth A isn’t held accountable for his actions, his behaviors will\ncontinue regardless of his next placement. He stated in no way\nwas it done in a yelling/angry tone.\nDHHS TDM Facilitator said during TDM’s all participants are\nasked if they have any issues or concerns and if everyone is in\nagreement and points out the goal of transparency and to give\neveryone a chance to provide input. HIC Tribal PO was asked\nabout issues/concerns, and she didn’t speak up.\n3",
    "DHHS TDM Facilitator was asked about the other allegations\nwithin the complaint regarding inappropriate comments by PAFC\nFCW toward Youth A. He stated the comments regarding Youth A\nbeing cute and pointing out what happens to cute boys in\ndetention is not something that was said during the TDM while he\nwas in attendance.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Purchase of\nService Foster Care Supervisor (DHHS POS FC supervisor)\nwas interviewed via telephone on March 19, 2025. She stated\nshe was in attendance during a TDM on March 4, 2025, to discuss\nplacement options/brainstorm for Youth A because relative\nplacement (grandparents) has indicated they can no longer care\nfor him due to his behaviors. DHHS POS FC supervisor stated\nYouth A and his siblings have been in care for 44 months. The\nbiological parents are not working toward reunification and Youth\nA’s behaviors have been challenging. The team at the TDM was\ntrying to come up with options for him and felt that everyone has\nthe same goal in mind for him. She stated none of the participants\nwere pointing fingers or blaming anyone and felt the group was\nbrainstorming a number of options. The team was trying to think\noutside the box due to the ongoing placement crisis and level of\ndifficulty regarding Youth A due to his behaviors. Conversation\ntook place to preserve the current placement with relatives and\nthe possibility of keeping him there with tighter reins.\nDuring the meeting PAFC FCW did indicate there haven’t been\nconsequences for Youth A’s probation, but it wasn’t in the context\nthat the tribe isn’t doing anything about it. Youth A continues to\nhave positive drug screens. She didn’t get the impression there\nwas any bullying. During the meeting it was pointed out the length\nof time Youth A has been on probation, the number of violations\nhe has had and the overall lack of consequences. HIC Tribal PO\nwas the only representative from the tribe and there were some\nquestions directed about what the tribal judge could do or tribal\nprobation. There were several ideas that were brought up and\ndiscussed. She freely admitted that she would acknowledge if she\nwitnessed any inappropriate behavior and that was not the case\nduring the time she participated in the TDM. She clarified that she\nhad to sign off the meeting early and thinks she missed the last 40\nminutes of the meeting.\nDHHS POS FC supervisor was asked about the other allegations\nwithin the complaint regarding inappropriate comments by PAFC\nFCW toward Youth A. She stated she has no knowledge of any\n4",
    "inappropriate comments made by PAFC FCW toward or about\nYouth A.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Purchase of\nService Foster Care worker (DHHS POS FCW) was\ninterviewed via telephone on March 25, 2025. She stated she\nwas present at the TDM that was held on March 4, 2025,\nregarding Youth A. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss\nplacement options for Youth A as his relative caregiver has\nadvised he needs to be moved from their home due to extensive\nongoing behaviors. She stated she did not feel PAFC FCW was\ninappropriate or displayed any bullying behavior during the\nmeeting. There was a level of frustration as there was no\nresolution after a lengthy meeting and no official plans put in\nplace. During the TDM there was discussion regarding what can\nbe done to maintain current placement with relative caregiver and\nif that isn’t possible what options are available to keep him in the\ncommunity including another relative placement or fictive kin.\nThere was also discussion that if the other options are not\npossible, there is a chance he will end up in a placement\ndownstate. Part of the discussion included what options may be\navailable through his probation since he has continued to violate\nthe terms of his probation.\nDHHS POS FCW was asked about the other allegations within the\ncomplaint regarding inappropriate comments by FCW toward\nYouth A. She is not aware of any comments made to Youth A\nregarding his appearance and what could happen if he ends up in\ndetention or prison.\nCommunity Mental Health Wraparound Coordinator (CMH\nWraparound Coordinator) was interviewed via telephone on\nMarch 25, 2025. She stated she is the Wraparound Coordinator\nfor Youth A and has worked with the family for a little over 2 years.\nShe attended the entire TDM (almost 2.5 hours) regarding Youth\nA on March 4, 2025. She stated Youth A has struggled with\nbehavioral issues and has not been adhering to his probation\nrequirements and the purpose of the TDM was to determine if it\nwas possible to preserve current placement with relatives and if\nnot, explore other placements options.\nShe stated she has worked with PAFC FCW many times and\ndidn’t view her behavior during the TDM as being unprofessional.\nShe was attempting to come up with multiple placement options\nfor Youth A and was passionate in her efforts. She clarified due to\nstaffing issues, PAFC FCW doesn’t normally take on case\n5",
    "management as she is the Director of the agency, so people\naren’t used to working with her and observing her style. She didn’t\nobserve any tension between PAFC FCW and any of the\nparticipants of the meeting including tribal staff.\nShe stated she was not under the impression that PAFC FCW\nwas threatening to have Youth A sent downstate if the tribal\nemployee didn’t agree to certain actions. It was more if this\ndoesn’t happen, we will have to consider placement options in\nother areas of the state due to limited options in the Upper\nPeninsula (UP). There is a good chance if a placement is located\nit will be downstate.\nThere was a court hearing held last week in tribal court regarding\nYouth A. He is failing most of his classes, failing drug screens and\nnot adhering to other aspects of his probation. The probation\nviolations do not rise to the level of requiring detention. HIC Tribal\nPO did an assessment through probation and that also\ndetermined Youth A does not meet criteria for detention and could\nbenefit from community-based services instead. PAFC FCW\nupdated the court with the efforts to maintain current placement\nand also locate another family member, fictive kin and licensed\nfoster placement. Family members are willing to take him for\nrespite only but nothing long term. CMH Wraparound Coordinator\nmade the recommendation in court to consider Great Lakes\nRecovery Adolescent to address his substance abuse since this is\nan issue and Youth A has acknowledged the issue and also his\nneed for help. The judge liked the idea, and the team is trying to\nsee if that is possible.\nCMH Wraparound Coordinator was asked about the other\nallegations within the complaint regarding inappropriate comments\nby PAFC FCW toward Youth A. She stated she did not have any\nknowledge of inappropriate comments made by PAFC FCW\ntoward Youth A. She stated she meets with Youth A on a weekly\nbasis, and he has not said anything about PAFC FCW saying\nthings that he found to be upsetting or inappropriate.\nPrivate Agency Foster Care Foster Care Supervisor (PAFC FC\nsupervisor) was interviewed via telephone on March 27, 2025.\nShe stated there was a lengthy TDM held on March 4, 2025, to\ndiscuss placement options for Youth A. Prior to the TDM there\nwas a phone call between PAFC FCW, HIC Tribal PO, HIC SS\nDirector and PAFC CW supervisor. It is her understanding, based\non what PAFC FCW reported to her, the conversation revolved\n6",
    "around whether or not Youth A could be determined as an Act 150\nwhich may open up additional placement options.\nPAFC FC supervisor stated the purpose of the TDM was to\nbrainstorm and come up with possible options for Youth A. She\nclarified Youth A has been in relative placement for over 3 years\nand they have asked for him to be moved due to ongoing\nbehavioral issues. She felt the tone of the meeting was a team\ncoming together with the same goal in mind to come up with\noptions for placement. Throughout the meeting the team\ndiscussed many potential placement options. It was also\ndiscussed that the consequences from probation have not had an\nimpact on Youth A but it was not addressed in a way that placed\nblame on anyone or entity in particular or done in a threatening\nmanner. The reality of being in a rural area and a lack of\nplacement options overall but specifically for older youth with\nbehavioral issues was also discussed and the team may need to\nconsider placement options downstate.\nPAFC FC supervisor was asked about the other allegations within\nthe complaint regarding inappropriate comments toward Youth A.\nShe stated PACF FCW reported to her after her home visit with\nYouth he was repeatedly making threatening statements about\nwanting to kill his mother’s boyfriend. PAFC FC supervisor stated\nPAFC FCW reported attempting to caution Youth A that jail/prison\nis not a place he would want to be and everything seemed to be a\njoke to Youth A. PAFC FCW told Youth A that he was cute and in\nprison 5 guys would hold you down. PAFC FC supervisor stated\nshe wasn’t concerned by the comment based on the context of the\nentire conversation and it was an attempt to reason with Youth A\nso he could see the potential consequences of committing that\ntype of violent act.\nRelative Caregiver was interviewed via telephone on March\n31, 2025. She stated she attended the TDM that was held on\nMarch 4, 2025. She stated PAFC FCW has been nothing short of\nfabulous and she in no way was inappropriate or displayed any\nbullying behavior during the meeting. PAFC FCW indicated during\nthe meeting relative caregivers have stated they are no longer\nable to provide placement due to Youth A’s ongoing behaviors, so\nthe meeting revolved around trying to come up with other ideas to\nmaintain placement or find something to keep him in the area.\nThere was discussion regarding the UP being more rural and less\nplacement options so if there isn’t another option Youth A may\nneed to be placed in a foster home or detention downstate. It was\n7",
    "not stated in a threatening manner but more as this is where we’re\nat because we don’t have any other options.\nRelative Caregiver stated Youth A has been in her and her\nhusband’s care for 3.5 years. Youth A and his younger brother’s\nbehaviors have been out of control, and it is partially due to\nbiological parents coming in and out of their lives or seeing them\nin the community. She became emotional when discussing\nreaching the decision for Youth A and his younger brother to be\nmoved from their home. She feels frustrated because PAFC FCW\nhas been wonderful to work with and she was run out due to the\nstress of the complaints and difficult interactions. She expressed\nfurther frustration regarding the lack of consequences for Youth A\nwhile he has been on probation. She clarified Youth A is failing all\nof his classes and hasn’t passed a drug screen since the end of\nOctober and there have been little to no consequences.\nRelative caregiver was asked about the other allegations within\nthe complaint regarding inappropriate comments by PAFC FCW\ntoward Youth A. She stated PAFC FCW reported the conversation\nto her after meeting with Youth A and indicated she made\ncomments to that effect however it was taken out of context.\nYouth A was mad because he found out his mother went back to\nher ex-boyfriend who he doesn’t like. He made a comment that he\nwas going to kill him or have someone else kill him. PAFC FCW\nadvised Youth A that wouldn’t be smart move and would end up in\nprison. Youth A was puffing up his chest and acting like he could\nhandle himself in prison and PAFC FCW repeated that he would\nend up in prison and prison is not a place for you as you know\nwhat happens to cute boys in prison. Youth A continued repeating\nthe threats and she was trying to get him to realize that because\nof his good looks prison life would be very different than what his\nperception is and if he would to follow through on the threats that’s\nwhere he would end up. She stated she is very protective of her\ngrandkids and if she thought for one-minute PAFC FCW had said\nor done anything that was inappropriate she would have\nimmediately spoken up and addressed it. In her opinion it was\nappropriate based on the context of the conversation and knowing\nYouth A. She clarified when he is escalated it can be very difficult\nto have a conversation with him and to get him to hear the\nmessage you are conveying. Youth A was not upset and never\nbrought it up to her. She stated the conversation occurred during\nthe home visit in either February or March.\nYouth A was interviewed via telephone on March 27, 2025. He\nwas asked if there was an incident recently where he and PAFC\n8",
    "FCW had a discussion about what would happen if he would to go\nto prison or detention and what could happen. He indicated he\nwasn’t sure, so he was specifically asked about a conversation\nwhere he made statements, he wanted to kill his mother’s\nboyfriend after learning he had been physically abusive and there\nwas a history of physical abuse. He recalled the conversation but\nstated he couldn’t recall details. He was asked if PAFC FCW\nmade a comment that he was “cute and what could happen to him\nif he were to go to prison or detention” He stated he does not\nrecall those comments. He was asked the question a second time\nlater in the interview and he said he recalled PAFC FCW stating in\ngeneral terms that going to prison or detention wouldn’t be a good\nthing and it’s not a good place to be. It was more a cautionary\nstatement and nothing inappropriate.\nHe stated there has never been a time where PAFC FCW said\nanything inappropriate to him or made him uncomfortable. He\nclarified he always felt comfortable talking with PAFC FCW. He\nstated if she had ever made any statements that were\ninappropriate or made him uncomfortable, he would have spoken\nup. He identified he has other people in his life that he would be\ncomfortable reporting if anything inappropriate occurred or made\nhim uncomfortable.\nPAFC FCW was interviewed via telephone on April 3, 2025.\nShe has been the assigned foster care worker for Youth A and his\nsiblings since August 2024. She stated there was a TDM on\nMarch 4, 2025, regarding Youth A to discuss placement options.\nDue to Youth A’s escalating behaviors, relative caregivers had\npreviously asked for him to be removed from their home. He has\ndisplayed verbal aggression to relative caregiver. PAFC FCW\nstated, at times, Youth A will become so escalated that it’s best to\nlet it play out because if you try and diffuse, he escalates even\nmore. He is struggling significantly with school and failing his\nclasses. The purpose of the TDM was to discuss different relative\noptions, funding options and other non-relative options. She stated\nshe doesn’t feel she came across as bullying or verbally\naggressive. She stated she wasn’t at all angry at the meeting. She\nfelt it was a gathering of individuals who have the same goal in\nmind regarding Youth A and trying to troubleshoot ideas and come\nup with a plan for placement. She acknowledged that sometimes\nshe talks fast and can be blunt but could not think of any time\nduring the meeting where she was inappropriate in any way\nespecially with other members of the meeting.\n9",
    "Prior to the TDM she was speaking with Private Agency Foster\nCare Child Welfare supervisor (PAFC Child Welfare supervisor)\nwho was previously employed in Juvenile Justice at MDHHS.\nThey were discussing placement options for Youth A and PAFC\nChild Welfare supervisor stated in the past they used to commit\nyouth as Act 150’s. They then called HIC SS Director and HIC\nTribal PO to discuss this as a possibility. The purpose of the call\nwas to discuss placement options for Youth A. PAFC FCW was\nasking questions in order to determine if Act 150 was an\nappropriate route or not. She felt the meeting went through with no\nconcerns and there was no mention of anyone being upset. At one\npoint, HIC SS Director made the comment that they need to hold\ntheir youth more accountable through probation.\nPAFC FCW stated she called HIC Tribal PO after being told she\nwas upset after the TDM. She offered an apology for hurting her\nfeelings and inquired about what she had said that made her\nupset and HIC Tribal PO said PAFC FCW made the comment that\nprobation wasn’t doing anything for Youth A. PAFC FCW stated\nshe told HIC Tribal PO that she meant probation in general and\nnot HIC Tribal PO specifically doesn’t help or care. She\napologized for the poor choice of words and thought it had been\nsettled. She then called HIC SS Director and left a voicemail\napologizing for upsetting HIC Tribal PO and asked for a return\nphone call, but she has not received a return phone call. PAFC\nFCW was adamant that she was not inappropriate in any way\nduring the meeting and feels she did not do anything to warrant a\ncomplaint. She stated during the meeting she made a comment\nthat if they can’t come up with a viable placement option Youth A\nwill end up downstate. She clarified that wasn’t a threat but the\nreality of the situation. Placement is difficult and it’s even more\ndifficult to locate placement for a teenager who has behavioral\nissues in a rural area. She stated HIC SS Director stated, “well\nthat happens sometimes with our kids”.\nPAFC FCW was asked about the other allegations within the\ncomplaint regarding inappropriate comments toward Youth A.\nPAFC FCW stated during a home visit on March 1, 2025, she held\na private meeting with Youth A and was discussing his school\nstruggles, and he became upset. At some point during the\nconversation, he began talking about his mother’s boyfriend and\nhow he was going to kill him because he is physically abusive\ntowards his mother. She stated Youth A went into detail about\nhow he planned on killing mother’s boyfriend making statements\nabout having access to guns and knowing people who would help.\nShe stated he made the same threat at least 3 times during the\n10",
    "conversation. She tried to reason with Youth A by stating that isn’t\nsomething you want to do and asked if he wanted to end up in\nprison for the rest of his life. Youth A made a comment that he’s\nstrong and would do fine if he were to go to prison and she said\nand you’re “cute” and he repeated that he was strong. She stated\nyou aren’t going to be strong if 6 men are holding you down. She\nstated Youth A did not have a reaction and again indicated he\nwould just assault his mother’s boyfriend. She said conversation\ncontinued for a little while regarding possible legal consequences.\nPAFC FCW stated she doesn’t feel Youth A would’ve followed\nthrough on the threat at that point but expressed concern as he\nbecame older due to struggling to regulate his emotions and lack\nof insight on consequences and what that could look like for him.\nShe referenced the conversation to others because she was so\nconcerned about the threats Youth A was making. She stated she\ndidn’t feel it was inappropriate based on the context of the\nconversation and how it flowed and his perception of prison and\nwhat the experience could be like for him.\nPAFC Child Welfare supervisor was interviewed via telephone\non April 4, 2025. She stated she was not part of the TDM on\nMarch 4, 2025, but prior to the TDM she participated in a phone\ncall that included PAFC FCW, HIC Tribal PO, and HIC SS\nDirector. PAFC Child Welfare supervisor stated she was\npreviously a Juvenile Justice worker at MDHHS. The purpose of\nthe meeting was to brainstorm to determine placement options\nand if Youth A could be an Act 150.\nShe felt the conversation was civil and never contentious. HIC SS\nDirector wasn’t aware of what an Act 150 was, so PAFC Child\nWelfare supervisor explained what that meant. There were no\ncomments that indicated tribal staff were not doing their jobs. The\nconversation included some placement options but also cautioned\nthat if there isn’t a resolution he will probably have to be moved\ndownstate due to the limited placement options in the UP.\nPAFC Child Welfare supervisor was asked about the other\nallegations within the complaint regarding inappropriate comments\nby PAFC FCW toward Youth A. She stated during the meeting\nwith the tribe PAFC FCW updated them on her recent meeting\nwith Youth A. She reported she had recently met with Youth A and\nwas concerned due to his escalating behaviors and making\nthreats about wanting to murder people. PAFC FCW reported\nYouth A believes he’s untouchable and there will not be\nconsequences if he follows through on the threats he was making.\nShe reported telling Youth A something to the effect “you’re not\n11",
    "strong enough to deal with 6 people holding you down.” She\ndoesn’t recall any reaction regarding that statement during the\ncall.\nMaternal Uncle was interviewed via telephone on April 4,\n2025. He stated he attended the TDM on March 4, 2025,\nregarding placement options for Youth A. He stated he did not\nwitness any behavior that he would consider inappropriate or\nbullying.\nMaternal Uncle was asked about the other allegations within the\ncomplaint regarding inappropriate comments by PAFC FCW\ntoward Youth A. He stated he has no knowledge of the other\nallegations.\nHannahville Indian Community Social Services Director (HIC\nSS Director) was interviewed via telephone on April 11, 2025.\nShe stated a TDM was held on March 4, 2025, to discuss\nplacement options for Youth A. Youth A is currently residing with\nRelative Caregiver but they have asked that he be moved. HIC SS\nDirector clarified she was not present at the TDM however HIC\nTribal PO was. Prior to the TDM on March 4, 2025, HIC Tribal PO\nhad been on a phone call with PAFC FCW. While on the phone\ncall she walked into her office and HIC SS Director then joined the\ncall. During the call PAFC FCW stated the tribe needs to get\nYouth A committed to a facility and they are able to do that\nthrough Act 150. HIC SS Director indicated during the call that she\nis not familiar with Act 150 and that isn’t how their process works.\nAt that point, PAFC FCW stated it will be the tribe’s responsibility\nwhen Youth A ends up being moved downstate and continued to\nbe argumentative regarding what the tribe is and is not able to do\nregarding Youth A’s placement. She acknowledged Youth A can\nbe challenging but stated the tribe doesn’t feel Youth A’s\nbehaviors warrant being sent to detention at this time.

    "together. She stated she recognizes PAFC FCW isn’t typically\nassigned to cases as the case manager. She feels PAFC FCW\nneeds to be more aware of her tone and choice of words moving\nforward when working with youth who have experienced trauma.\nIn addition, knowing when it’s appropriate to back down on the\nconversation if a youth becomes escalated and revisit the topic\nlater or in a different way that would be more receptive.\nHIC SS Director was asked about the other allegations within the\ncomplaint regarding inappropriate comments by PAFC FCW\ntoward Youth A. During the phone conversation with PAFC FCW,\nPAFC Child Welfare supervisor, HIC Tribal PO and herself that\ntook place prior to the TDM, PAFC FCW was describing an\ninteraction she had with Youth A during a home visit.

HIC SS Director stated PAFC\nFCW reported she was discussing Youth A’s behaviors with him\nand how he can become aggressive, and his behavior could land\nhim in jail, and this is what would happen to him if he went to jail.\nHIC SS Director stated she is in full agreement that youth should\nbe made aware of potential consequences if they break the law\nhowever she felt the way PAFC FCW went about it was not\nappropriate.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• FTM held on March 4, 2025, TDM. Summary of meeting:\nMeeting discussed placement options, options for services,\nand behaviors of the children. Concerns expressed are how\ndifficult placement would be for the children and to keep the\nchildren together. Both siblings have had behavioral issues\nthat have led to the current relative providers indicating that\nthey are not able to continue with placement. Variety of\noptions discussed, and more discussion is needed.\nMarch 1, 2025, social work contact from home visit with\nPAFC FCW, Youth A and Relative Caregiver. Private\nmeeting between Youth A and PAFC FCW. “Youth A made\ncomments about killing his mother's boyfriend because he\nphysically abuses her. After further discussion regarding the\nconsequences of murder, he discussed assaulting the man.\nYouth A believes that if he simply assaults this man he will\nnot get caught. Youth A does not believe he has behavioral\nissues and justifies all of his actions. He has never\nconsidered that his placement may not be maintained\nbecause of his behaviors”.\n13",
    "• April 1, 2025, tribal court order regarding Youth A. “The\nneeds of the child cannot be met in a foster home.\nPlacement of the child in a qualified residential treatment\nprogram provides the most effective and appropriate level\nof care for the child in the least restrictive environment and\nis consistent with the goals in the permanency plan for the\nchild”.\nAnalysis In regard to the initial portion of the complaint regarding PAFC\nFCW displaying aggressive and bullying behavior towards HIC\nTribal PO during a TDM, the agency is in compliance.

Although PAFC FCW\nwas trying to caution Youth A on potential consequences of\ncommitting violent acts, the comment made was not appropriate,\nespecially when working with youth in care who have experienced\ntrauma.\nConclusion Violation Established\n14",
