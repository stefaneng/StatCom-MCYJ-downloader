Staff 1 enters the\nhallway right behind her, while Staff 3 stands at the entrance to\nthe hallway and Staff 2 remains in C-wing. Staff 1 stands right\nnext to Youth A. Youth A turns her body away from Staff 1, faces\nthe wall and puts the sheet inside her shirt. Then she turns back\naround and puts her hand on the door handle right by Staff 1.\nYouth A lets go of the door handle and quickly snatches Staff 1’s\nhat off his head. Staff 1 then proceeds to snatch Youth A’s bonnet\noff her head. Youth A puts Staff 1’s hat inside her shirt.\nLater in the video, Youth A spits on Staff 1, and Staff 1 launches\nhimself forward towards her and pushes her into the wall while still\nholding onto her wrist. Shortly after, all three staff back up and\nYouth A advances towards Staff 1 again. Staff 1 holds out his\nhand and blocks Youth A from spitting on him again. Staff 1 backs\nup but continues to put his hand inches away from Youth A’s face\nand waves it.

Youth A spits on Staff 1 again, and Staff\n1 advances towards her and pushes Youth A against the wall\nagain. A little bit later, Staff 1 puts his hand inches away from\nYouth A’s face, and Youth A pushes his hand away. Youth A spits\nat Staff 1 again and it looks like Staff 1 tries to push Youth A’s\nhead, but Youth A has a hold of Staff 1’s arms so he’s unable to.\nStaff 1 is not seen spitting on Youth A during the video.

It is clear from the\nvideo the situation between Youth A and Staff 1 was already\nescalated when this interaction occurred.\nAlthough Youth A is seen spitting on Staff 1 in the video, the video\ndoes not clearly show Staff 1 spitting on Youth A. Staff 1 and Staff\n2 report Staff 1 did not spit on Youth A, while Staff 3 reports the\nopposite.

Staff 2 continues to grab\nYouth A’s wrists/arms with his hands while also continuing to back\nup trying to move away from Youth A.\nYouth A puts her finger on Staff 1’s forehead. Staff 1 swats Youth\nA’s finger off his forehead and then holds Youth A’s wrists. Staff 3\ncomes over and uses her hands to release Staff 1’s hands from\nYouth A’s wrists.\nYouth A attempts to hit Staff 1 again, but Staff 2 and Staff 3 block\nher hits and grab Youth A’s wrist to prevent her hits. Youth A\nstops trying to hit Staff 1 and refocuses on trying to get the bonnet\nout of Staff 1’s hand. Staff 1 does not let go of the bonnet, so\nYouth A then tries to bite Staff 1’s hand. When that doesn’t work,\nYouth A raises her hand to hit Staff 1, but Staff 1 and Staff 3 block\nher. Staff 1 holds Youth A’s wrist and pins it above her head\nagainst the wall for a second before Youth A squirms and brings\nher arm down. Staff 1 is still holding onto Youth A’s wrist and\nbrings Youth A’s arm so it’s around her neck and Staff 1 holds it\nthere briefly. Youth A is in the corner by the wall/door and Staff 1\nis in front of her, which blocks the camera angle. Staff 1 is\nblocking Youth A into the corner. It’s clear they’re still struggling,\nbut their hands and arms can’t be seen. Staff 2 and Staff 3 are\nright next to them and try to intervene. Youth A tries to hit Staff 1,\nbut Staff 1 grabs her wrist and backs her further into the corner,\nwith him very close to her. Staff 1 takes a couple steps back and\nYouth A advances forward. Staff 3 tries to put her arm between\nthem. Youth A gets the bonnet out of Staff 1’s hand, raises her\narm and hits him. Staff 3 tries again to get in between them. Youth\nA backs up, and Staff 1 releases Youth A’s wrist, so they are\ncomplete separate. Youth A then swings her arm and hits Staff 2\nwho is beside her. Youth A remains standing in the corner with\nStaff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3 surrounding her. Youth A moves away\nfrom the wall and attempts to walk past Staff 1, but Staff 1 grabs\nher upper arms and pushes her backwards into the door. Youth A\n12",
    "tries to fight back and then Staff 1 uses his elbow/arm and body to\nbody check Youth A into the wall. Youth A slides down the wall\nand sits on the floor. Youth A is on the floor while Staff 1 has a\nhand on Youth A holding her down. Youth A gets out of Staff 1’s\ngrasp, kneels on the floor, sits on her feet and begins hitting Staff\n1. Staff 1 then pushes Youth A down so she’s kneeling on the\nfloor again, and Staff 1 uses his hand to hold her down again.\nYouth A crawls and positions her body so she can kneel and gets\nup to hit Staff 1 again. Staff 1 grabs one of Youth A’s wrists and\nholds on.\nYouth A attempts to hit Staff 1 again, but Staff 1 grabs her wrist\nand launches towards her, pinning Youth A between his body and\nthe wall. Staff 2 and Staff 3 advance towards them, but due to the\ncamera angle, it’s difficult to see what's happening. When Staff 1,\nand Staff 2 back up, Youth A gets up from the floor, stands up and\nadvances towards Staff 1 again. She attempts to hit Staff 1, but\nStaff 1 grabs both of her wrists and prevents her from hitting him.\nYouth A spits on Staff 1, and Staff 1 launches himself forward\ntowards her and pushes her into the wall while still holding onto\nher wrist. Youth A punches Staff 1, and Staff 1 then pushes Youth\nA against the door. Youth A and Staff 1 fight against each other\nwith both of their arms flailing towards each other while Staff 1 still\nhas Youth A pushed against the door. Staff 2 and Staff 3 try to\nintervene and get between them.\nStaff 1 holds Youth A’s wrists and twists his body, so his forearm\nis against Youth A, pushing her into the door and then guiding her\ndown to the floor. Staff 2 goes on the other side of Youth A. Staff 1\nand Staff 2 each have one of Youth A’s wrists while Youth A is\nsquatting/kneeling on the floor. Staff 1 and Staff 2 almost get\nYouth A into a CPI approved Team Control position (restraint), but\nYouth A is moving so much, they end up releasing the restraint\nbefore it was fully successful. Youth A then lays on the floor, Staff\n1 bends over her with his hand on her, and Youth A kicks Staff 1\noff her. Staff 1 grabs Youth A’s leg and holds her ankle while she\nis still laying with her back on the floor. Youth A is trying to get up\nbut is unable to because Staff 1 has her foot elevated. Youth A\nuses her other foot to kick Staff 1, but Staff 2 grabs her other\nankle and holds it. Youth A continues kicking, which causes Staff\n1 and Staff 2 to release her legs.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident report dated 1/6/25 authored by Staff 2 states Staff\n2 was on the wing with Youth A. Youth A wanted to go to\nanother wing, but Staff 2 would not let her. Youth A threw a\n13",
    "cup of ice and a cup at Staff 2. Staff 3 came in to de-\nescalate the situation, but Youth A did not calm down.\nYouth A began to attack Staff 2, and a “clear” was called by\nStaff 3 and Staff 2. Staff 1 responded to the “clear” and\ntried to de-escalate the situation. Youth A aggressively\ncharged towards Staff 1 and started attacking him. Staff 2\nand Staff 1 had to physically manage Youth A due to her\naggressively attacking Staff 1. Staff 2 was on Youth A’s left\nside and Staff 1 was on Youth A’s right side, but it was\nunsuccessful because Youth A fell to the ground and Youth\nA eventually calmed down. Further down on the incident\nreport, Staff 2 notes “There was no physical management,\njust a team hold”.\n• Youth A’s Safety Plan states staff are to remain calm in\ntheir presentation and model possible body-based self-\nregulation techniques. Staff are to structure the\nenvironment and set healthy limits. Staff are to use calm\ntones and supportive words while verbally de-escalating\nYouth A.\n• Vista Maria Behavior Management Policy states behavior\nmanagement interventions are only used when a youth\npresents a danger to self or others. These interventions\nshould only be used when all other less restrictive behavior\nmanagement interventions (i.e. verbal de-escalation,\ntherapeutic interventions) have been explored. Staff are\ntrained in techniques to identify a youth’s behaviors, events\nand environmental factors that may trigger emergency\nsafety situations. Staff are trained to use non-physical\nintervention skills such as verbal de-escalation, mediation\nconflict resolution, active listening, and verbal and\nobservational methods to prevent emergency safety\nsituations. Staff are trained in the safe use of physical\nintervention and behavior management strategies by a\ncertified instructor. All youth will have a Youth Behavior\nManagement Risk Assessment/Safety Plan completed\nupon admission, which will be shared with eh treatment\nteam. Two or more employees must be present before\nphysical interventions are performed. The request to initiate\na physical intervention must be communicated immediately\nto a team lead or supervisor and a leader will be present on\nevery shift to assist with crisis and offer support and\nguidance to staff involved. Staff are only permitted to utilize\napproved behavior management techniques as taught by\nan approved behavior management technique. Provision of\n14",
    "water will be provided as needed. Behavior management\ninterventions will not be used as a form of discipline, to\nforce compliance, or for the convenience of staff. Physical\nintervention practices shall not be imposed as a means of\ncoercion, discipline, convenience or retaliation by staff.\nProhibited intervention practices include any physical\nintervention technique that may constrict a youth’s\nbreathing, leg/ankle restriction or physical intervention, or\nwrist physical intervention behind the back.\n• CPI Physical Intervention Pictures and Workbook do not\nshow any physical interventions involving the following:\no Holding a youth’s wrists to prevent them from hitting\nstaff.\no Holding a youth on their side on the floor, while staff\nare laying on top of the youth and holding the\nyouth’s wrists as well as the youth’s legs.\no Holding a youth up against a wall as a form of\nrestraint.\no Holding a youth up against a wall with the staff’s\nforearm pressed against the youth’s body.\n• Staff 1 had 3 disciplinary actions in his employee file\nunrelated to this incident. Staff 1 was terminated on 1/8/25\nbecause of this incident. Staff 1 completed CPI training\n(6/24/24 & 6/25/24) and Employee Training Guide (7/1/24 &\n7/2/24).\n• Staff 2 has 5 disciplinary actions in his employee file\nunrelated to this incident. Staff 2 completed CPI training\n(10/2/24 & 10/3/24) and Employee Training Guide\n(10/16/24).\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as per interviews\nconducted, video reviewed, and documentation reviewed, Staff 1\nand Staff 2 inappropriately restrained Youth A on multiple\noccasions.\n• Staff 1 and Staff 2 restrained Youth A when Youth A was\nlaying on the floor. Youth A was laying on her side, and\nStaff 1 laid on top of her in a perpendicular fashion with his\nstomach on her side.\n• Staff 1 and Staff 2 also restrained Youth A’s legs/ankles,\nwhich is a prohibited physical intervention according to the\nfacility’s policy.\n15",
    "• Staff 1 also inappropriately restrained Youth A multiple\ntimes against the wall with his forearm across her body or\nneck.\n• In addition, there were multiple times where Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 held Youth A’s wrists to prevent her from hitting\nthem, which is not an approved practice per the CPI\nmanual.\nTechnical Assistance\n• The facility should consider conducting an in-depth training\nrelated to power struggles between staff and youth. There\nwere multiple times in the video footage where Staff 1 could\nhave released Youth A’s bonnet since it was a clear point\nof contention between Youth A and Staff 1, but Staff 1\nfailed to do so, and the situation escalated further as a\nresult. This training should focus on de-escalation skills (i.e.\nverbal de-escalation, walking away if the youth is safe, etc.)\n• The facility should train staff what to do in situations where\nthe team leads or supervisors are the individuals\nconducting themselves inappropriately. In this situation,\nStaff 3 knew Staff 1 was not conducting himself\nappropriately or de-escalating the situation, but she\nreported feeling she could not step in or intervene because\nStaff 1 was her superior.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2025SIC0000199 dated 2/26/25; CAP pending\nRule Code CCI Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nTitle & prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nSection (4) Only the least restrictive intervention necessary to prevent\nDescription immediate harm to the youth or others may be used and must\nfollow an individualized set of graduated interventions that avoid\nthe use of restraints.\nViolation Additional Finding of Non-Compliance.\nType\nAllegation Staff did not use appropriate non-physical interventions prior to\nrestraining a youth.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nAttempts were made to interview Youth A face to face at the\nfacility on 1/16/25 in coordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth\nA refused to be interviewed despite multiple attempts made during\nthis visit.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/8/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported as soon as\n16",
    "Youth A was on the floor, the staff left her alone. Staff 1 reported\nwhen a female staff (unknown who) entered the room, she was\ntrying to de-escalate Youth A. Staff 3 reported when he and Youth\nA took each other’s hat and bonnet, they were playing around,\nand they returned them to each other once the female staff\nmember de-escalated the situation. Staff 1 did not provide any\nexamples of ways he attempted to de-escalate Youth A. Staff 1\nreported he never restrained Youth A.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/8/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 did not provide any\nexamples for how he tried to de-escalate Youth A prior to using\nphysical intervention such as grabbing her wrists and holding her\nankles so Youth A would stop hitting and kicking. Staff 2 reported\nno one restrained Youth A during the incident.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via video conference on 1/14/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported when she\nentered the wing, Youth A was escalated towards Staff 2 and Staff\n3 was trying to de-escalate her by verbally talking to her. Staff 3\nreported she continued to try to verbally de-escalate Youth A\nthroughout the incident, but it wasn’t working. Staff 3 reported she\nfelt she couldn’t speak against what Staff 1 and Staff 2 were doing\nwhen physically managing Youth A because Staff 1 was the team\nleader, which means he was Staff 3’s superior. Staff 3 reported\nshe did not remember what Staff 1 or Staff 2 said to Youth A, but\nshe did not hear them make attempts to de-escalate Youth A or\nthe situation.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 1/6/25 was reviewed. It should be noted the\nvideo does not have any audio. The video shows C-wing. The\nentire incident lasted for approximately 20 minutes. Staff 1 holds\nYouth A’s arms and pushes her onto her side laying on the\nground. Staff 1 holds both of Youth A’s arms in front of her body,\nacross her chest. Then he lays down on top of Youth A’s side\nperpendicular to her body while he is still holding her arms. Staff 2\nis standing above them watching. Staff 1 pushes Youth A’s arms\ntowards the ground, and Staff 2 comes around (in front of the\ncamera view) and squats down in front of Youth A. Youth A’s\nupper body and face cannot be seen. Since Staff 2 is blocking the\ncamera view, it is unknown what Staff 1 and Staff 2 are doing;\nhowever, Staff 1 remains laying on Youth A’s side. Youth A begins\nkicking her legs at Staff 2, so he moves out of the camera view,\nand it is seen Staff 1 and Staff 2 are holding Youth A’s arms while\nStaff 1 remains laying on top of Youth A while she is laying on her\n17",
    "side on the floor. Staff 2 releases Youth A’s arms/wrists and\nstands up. Then Staff 1 stands up, but remains holding onto Youth\nA’s wrists/arms, which causes Youth A to lay on her back.

Youth A takes a\ncouple of steps forward towards Staff 1. Staff 1 puts each of his\nhands around each of Youth A’s arms to hold them at her sides.\nYouth A kicks Staff 1 once. When Youth A tries to kick Staff 1\nagain, he continues to hold onto her arms and pushes her\nbackwards. When Staff 1 pushes Youth A, he quickly releases\nher, and she stumbles backwards. She catches herself against the\nwall with her arm. Staff 2 walks around Youth A and stands closer\nto Staff 1. Youth A pushes off the wall and begins advancing\ntowards Staff 1 and raises her arm at him. Staff 1 puts both his\nhands out and grabs Youth A’s wrists. Staff 1 continues to hold\nher wrists while Youth A struggles. Staff 2 turns around and\nmoves a rolling chair out of the way. Youth A gets one of her\nwrists out of Staff 1’s grasp, and steps backwards. Staff 1\nreleases Youth A’s other wrist and takes a step back with his\nhands still outstretched in front of him. Youth A begins advancing\ntowards Staff 1, and again, raises her arm when she gets closer to\nhim. Staff 1 grabs Youth A’s lowered arm while Youth A’s other\narm is still up. Staff 1 releases Youth A’s arm and steps\nbackwards with his hands up in front of him. Staff 2 walks back\nover towards Staff 1. Youth A turns around and begins walking\naway from Staff 1.

Staff\n2 follows so he can see Youth A but does not get close to her.\nYouth A attempts to open one of the doors but is unsuccessful.\nYouth A turns around and walks back into the main area of C-wing\nand stands by the couch. She then picks up a cup and swings it\nforward, launching the ice at Staff 2. Youth A walks around the\ncouch and advances towards Staff 2. Staff 2 backs up to get away\nfrom her. Youth A tries to hit Staff 2 with the cup multiple times,\nbut Staff 2 blocks it. Staff 3 enters the room while Youth A\ncontinues advancing towards Staff 2. Staff 2 holds Youth A’s\n18",
    "wrists and keeps his arms out to keep Youth A at a distance.\nYouth A gets one of her wrists out of Staff 2’s grip, and then hits\nStaff 2’s other hand, which caused him to release her other wrist.\nStaff 2 then tries to get away from Youth A. Youth A advances on\nStaff 2 again and Staff 2 grabs her wrists with his hands again.\nStaff 3 picks up a bag off the floor and walks it towards the staff\nobservation area door. Youth A continues to advance on Staff 2\nand backs him into a corner of the room. Staff 2 continues to grab\nYouth A’s wrists/arms with his hands while also continuing to back\nup trying to move away from Youth A. Staff 3 goes over to them\nand puts her hands on Youth A’s arm and Staff 2 releases Youth\nA’s arm.

Youth A\nswings her arms at Staff 2 multiple times to hit him, but Staff 2\nblocks her hits and continues to back away from her to put\ndistance in between them. Staff 3 attempts to get in Youth A’s\npath to stop her advances on Staff 2. Youth A stops and stands by\nStaff 3, while Staff 2 moves to the other side of the room. Youth A\nwalks around the couch and begins to head in Staff 2’s direction\nagain, so Staff 2 stands behind the chair, so a barrier was\nbetween them. Youth A then turns around, picks up a sheet and\nbegins walking to the hallway area. At the same time, Staff 1\nreenters C-wing. Youth A stands by one of the doors in the\nhallway and looks in the window. Staff 1 enters the hallway right\nbehind her, while Staff 3 stands at the entrance to the hallway and\nStaff 2 remains in C-wing. Staff 1 stands right next to Youth A.\nYouth A turns her body away from Staff 1 and faces the wall. Then\nshe turns back around and puts her hand on the door handle right\nby Staff 1.

Youth A\nattempts to grab Staff 1, and Staff 1 uses his arms to block her.\nStaff 1 blocks her by putting one hand up against Youth A’s chest\nand the other hand against Youth A’s arm. Youth A and Staff 1\nbegin a tug-of-war with Youth A’s bonnet and Staff 1’s hat. Staff 3\nlooks as though she is trying to de-escalate the situation. Youth A\nadvances towards Staff 1 and body checks him into the wall while\n19",
    "they’re both still holding onto the hat. Staff 2 and Staff 3 are\npresent by them. Staff 1 releases a portion Youth A’s bonnet, so\nYouth A gets her hands on it. Staff 1 does not release it all the\nway, so Youth A continues to struggle trying to get her bonnet\nfrom Staff 1’s grip. Youth A pulls the bonnet hard which pulls Staff\n1 towards her. Youth A becomes more escalated and begins to try\nand hit Staff 1. Staff 1 continues to hold onto Youth A’s bonnet,\nand Youth A continues to try and get the bonnet from him. Youth\nA holds up her arm as if she’s going to hit Staff 1, but Staff 3 and\nStaff 2 put their hands up to block the hit. Staff 1 and Youth A are\nin each other’s faces exchanging words. Youth A attempts to hit\nStaff 1 again, but Staff 2 and Staff 3 block her hits and grab Youth\nA’s wrist to prevent her hit. Youth A stops trying to hit Staff 1 and\nrefocuses on trying to get the bonnet out of Staff 1’s hand. Staff 1\ndoes not let go of the bonnet, so Youth A then tries to bite Staff 1’s\nhand. When that doesn’t work, Youth A raises her hand to hit Staff\n1, but Staff 1 and Staff 3 block her. Staff 1 holds Youth A’s wrist\nand pins it above her head against the wall for a second before\nYouth A squirms and brings her arm down.

Youth A tries to fight back and then Staff 1 uses his\nelbow/arm and body to body check Youth A into the wall. Youth A\nslides down the wall and sits on the floor. Staff 3’s body is\nblocking the camera view so there’s no ability to see what is\nhappening between Youth A and Staff 1. However, Youth A\nremains on the floor and Staff 1 is standing and bending over her.\nStaff 3 moves backwards, and the camera shows Youth A on the\nfloor while Staff 1 has a hand on her holding her down. Youth A\ngets out of Staff 1’s grasp, kneels on the floor, sits on her feet and\nbegins hitting Staff 1. Staff 1 then pushes Youth A down so she’s\n20",

Youth A punches Staff 1, and Staff 1 then pushes\nYouth A against the door. Youth A and Staff 1 fight against each\nother with both of their arms flailing towards each other while Staff\n1 still has Youth A pushed against the door. Staff 2 and Staff 3 try\nto intervene and get between them. Youth A goes down to the\nfloor with the three staff surrounding her. Again, due to the camera\nangles and body positions of the staff, it’s difficult to tell what’s\nhappening while Youth A is on the floor. Shortly after, all three\nstaff back up and Youth A advances towards Staff 1 again. Staff 1\nholds out his hand and blocks Youth A from spitting on him again.\nStaff 1 backs up but continues to put his hand inches away from\nYouth A’s face and waves it. Youth A grabs Staff 1’s hand and\npushes it down, but he puts it up again, and Youth A pushes it\ndown again (this happens multiple times). Youth A spits on Staff 1\nagain, and Staff 1 advances towards her and pushes Youth A\nagainst the wall again.

Staff 1 grabs Youth A’s leg and holds\nher ankle while she is still laying with her back on the floor. Youth\nA is trying to get up but is unable to because Staff 1 has her foot\nelevated. Youth A uses her other foot to kick Staff 1, but Staff 2\ngrabs her other ankle and holds it. Youth A continues kicking,\nwhich causes Staff 1 and Staff 2 to release her legs.

Staff 2 goes onto C-wing\nbehind Staff 1. Staff 1 reenters the hall area and puts his hands on\nYouth A’s arms, blocking her from raising her arms. Staff 1 then\nmaneuvers himself behind Youth A, grabs her arms from behind\nher and pushes her front towards the wall. Staff 1 backs up, Youth\nA turns around, Staff 1 puts his hand inches away from Youth A’s\nface again, and Youth A pushes his hand away again.
