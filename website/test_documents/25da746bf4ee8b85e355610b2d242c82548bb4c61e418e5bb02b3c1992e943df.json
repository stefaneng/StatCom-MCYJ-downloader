INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff qualifications\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation In mid-April 2024 Desk Clerk allegedly sent a nude video of\nherself to Former Youth J after he was discharged from the\nfacility.\nInvestigation MISACWIS indicates Youth J was discharged from Mott\nResidence on 3/21/24 and placed at Methodist Children’s Home.\nInterviews:\nOn 4/22/24 I notified Youth J’s Foster Care Worker via email of\nthe assigned investigation and later we spoke on the phone. He\nexpressed no additional licensing concerns and said he approved\nFormer Youth J and Staff 2 to maintain contact after Youth J was\ndischarged.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker via phone on\n4/22/24. He said he talks to Former Youth J almost daily by\nphone. Staff 2 said Former Youth J told him that Former Youth C\n(now placed with a relative) received a video from Desk Clerk via\nInstagram. Former Youth C forwarded the video to Former Youth\nJ who in turn forwarded it him (Staff 2). Staff 2 said he still had\nthe video, and we asked him to retain it for law enforcement. He\nsaid the video is 14 seconds long and shows a woman completely\n2",
    "nude who he identified as Desk Clerk. Staff 2 denied that he had\nor has any type of relationship with Desk Clerk outside of the\nfacility. “We just worked together…only in a professional\ncapacity.” He mentioned that previously another former female\nstaff at Mott was also suspected of inappropriate behaviors with\nFormer Youth C. However, that allegation was made when Youth\nC and that female staff were still at the facility together and was\ninvestigated by Consultant 2 in SIR 2024SIC0001185.\nOn 4/22/24 I contacted Human Resources (HR) Director who\nsaid she was already aware of the allegation. She said she\nplaced Desk Clerk on administrative leave on 4/20/24 and\nterminated her on 4/23/24. HR Director stated Mott does not have\na policy prohibiting staff from contacting former youth.\nI collaborated with Government Worker who completed a well-\nbeing check on Former Youth J at Methodist Children’s Home and\nnotified law enforcement. Government Worker requested a\nforensic interview of Former Youth C.\nI interviewed Former Youth J jointly with Government Worker via\nphone on 4/22/24. He expressed no concerns at his current\nplacement. Former Youth J said he prefers Methodist to Mott\nbecause it is less restrictive. He said he does not own a cell\nphone but has access to a computer for on-line school. Former\nYouth J was not asked about the allegation at this time as not to\ninterfere with a potential police investigation.\nFormer Youth C was interviewed by Forensic Interviewer at\nVoices on 5/14/24 while Government Worker and I observed via\nZoom. Former Youth C described Mott Residential as “cool” and\nlisted the daily routine. He said there were “good” staff there and\none male staff he disliked.\nFormer Youth C was unaware of any staff being fired at Mott\nResidence. He said the other youths there were “pretty cool” but\nthey did not like the food or bedtime. Since he was discharged,\nFormer Youth C said he has kept in contact with two male staff via\ntext and has spoken with four former youths. He did not identify\nFormer Youth J as someone he communicated with. Former\nYouth C did not know why he was being interviewed. “They don’t\ngive me the allegations. Whatever it is, I don’t care about it. I want\nto go to the mall tomorrow.”\nI interviewed Residential Director (RD) jointly with Government\nWorker on 5/22/24 via phone. She has worked at Mott Residence\n3",
    "for 16 years. RD said Staff 2 forwarded to her via text an explicit\nvideo he received third hand from Former Youth J. She viewed\nthe video and said the woman in it appeared to be Desk Clerk.\nDesk Clerk’s employment was terminated immediately. Previous\nto being a Desk Clerk, RD said the former staff worked as a Direct\nCare Worker on the residential units. RD said there were no\nconcerns raised about her during her time in that role.\nI interviewed Staff 2 again jointly with Government Worker on\n5/22/24 via phone. Staff 2 confirmed he texted the video to RD\nand still has the video on his phone.\nGovernment Worker provided law enforcement with Staff 2’s direct\ncontact information if they wish to obtain the video from Staff 2.\nOn 6/5/24 Government Worker informed me that law enforcement\nhas permitted us to interview Former Youth J and Former Youth C\nregarding the specific allegation.\nI interviewed Former Youth J again on 6/5/24 jointly with\nGovernment Worker via phone. Asked if he knew anything about\na video, he asked “What kind of video?” Government Worker\nresponded, “An adult video.” Former Youth J responded, “I heard\nabout it from people in general after leaving Whaley (Mott). I\ndidn’t see it.” Asked if he knew the content of the video, Former\nYouth J said, “Desk Clerk nude, I think. I told Staff 2 because it\nwas weird.” Asked to provide names of who told him about a\nvideo. Former Youth J said, “I heard Desk Clerk sent it to Youth C\nafter he left. We couldn’t have phones at Whaley (Mott).” Then\nFormer Youth J asked, “Can she (Desk Clerk) get in trouble for\nthat or go to jail?” Government Worker responded that he did not\nknow. I asked Former Youth H how he knows there was a video if\nhe never saw it. He answered, “I don’t know. I never seen it.”\nFormer Youth J denied receiving a video from Former Youth C\nand denied sending it to Staff 2. Asked about his interactions with\nDesk Clerk when he was at Mott, Former Youth J said he barely\nsaw her or knew her.\nGovernment Worker and I interviewed Former Youth C jointly on\n6/5/24 via phone. He denied seeing a nude video of any staff or\nformer staff from Mott. He denied receiving a video from anyone\nor sending a video to anyone. When he was at Mott, he said he\nknew Desk Clerk, but has not corresponded with after he was\ndischarged. Former Youth C said he still sometimes sends and\nreceives texts from a few Mott staff, but the conversations are\nappropriate.\n4",
    "On 6/17/24 Government Worker discussed the allegation and\ninterviewed Former Desk Clerk at McDonald’s in Burton. Former\nDesk Clerk denied she ever sent a video or photo of herself nude\nto any resident or former resident. However, in October or\nNovember 2023 she said she did send a nude video of herself to\nStaff 2, who at the time, she considered dating. Former Desk\nClerk described the video as a selfie taken in a mirror. She said\nshe takes full responsibility for sending the video to an adult staff\nmember, it cost her her job and now she feels embarrassed and\nhumiliated. Former Desk Clerk denied having any contact with\nFormer Youth C or Former Youth J after they were discharged.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis Staff 2’s, Former Youth J’s, Former Youth C’s and Former Desk\nClerk’s accounts of the incident were inconsistent with one\nanother. Staff 2 said Former Youth J forwarded him a nude video\nof Former Desk Clerk that had been forwarded to Former Youth J\nfrom Former Youth C. Former Youth J denied ever seeing the\nvideo, receiving it from Former Youth C or sending it to Staff 2. A\nforensic interview of Former Youth C on 5/14/24 did not reveal any\ninformation relative to the allegation. On 6/5/24 Former Youth C\ntold me and Government Worker that he never saw a video of\nanyone, never received a video from anyone and never forwarded\na video to anyone. Former Desk Clerk said she sent a nude video\nof herself to Staff 2 last October or November but never sent\nanything to Former Youth J or Former Youth C.\nCONSULTATION\nI recommend Mott Children’s Residence prohibit communication\nbetween staff and former youths once the youths are discharged.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n5",
