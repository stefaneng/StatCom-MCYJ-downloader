    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12203 – Financial Stability\nSection\nDescription (1) An agency shall initially and annually develop and implement a\nplan of financing for the operation of the agency in carrying out its\nprograms and meeting the requirements for licensing. A plan of\nfinancing shall include all of the following:\n(a) A listing of all income sources and the anticipated amount of\nincome for the current fiscal year.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Financial audit from 2022 indicated financial health of the agency\nwas in decline that could potentially effect the provision of\nappropriate services.\nInvestigation I interviewed the Chief Administrator by telephone on 06/27/2023.\nThe Chief Administrator reported the excessive expenditures were\nrelated to recruitment/hiring expenses for new staff due to staff\nturnover, utility upgrades and building improvements and\nmaintenance expenses. He also reported a lower census count\nfor a period of time due to the need to recruit/hire new staff to\nhandle the census count within required ratios.\nI requested the Chief Administrator send me financial\nrevenue/expenses information for the last 6 months for review. I\nsent an email to the Chief Administrator on 7/05/2023 repeating\nthe request for the financial information. The information was\nsubmitted to me the following day on 07/06/2023. The financial\ninformation submitted indicated the agency had incoming revenue\nfor the time period of January thru June 2023 that was in excess\nof the reported expenses.\nAnalysis The financial information submitted indicated the agency had an\nexcess of revenue over expenses for the time period of January\nthru June 2023. There was also no evidence reported that the\nagency did not have adequate finances to support the program\nservices being provided. Should information become available to\nindicate that financial inadequacies are impacting the youth in\ncare this investigation will be re-opened.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n2",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n08/10/2023\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 11, 2023\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n3"
