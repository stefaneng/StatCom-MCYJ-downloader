The third foster home the agency cited foster parent\nqualifications, behavior management, medical and dental care and substitute care;\nagency notification.

A critical alert was sent to the agency\n6",
    "Resolution: The agency asked the relative to remove the blanket. The relative\ncomplied and a picture was taken of the crib without the blanket.
