The report did\nnot reference any youth being “pinned” to the bed. It actually\ndocumented that Youth A became upset and started “pushing and\nhitting on staff trying to get the tablet”. It further documented that\nno care was given and no first aid was administered.\nSaginaw State Police Report for Case No. 2371706664 – The\nreport documented that LE was dispatched to HOLA to obtain a\nreport regarding an assault. The report indicated Staff 1 and\nSupervisor 1 reported they had been assaulted by Youth A. Staff\n4",
    "1 reported Youth A “started swinging” at her and tried to grab the\nChrome Book. She also stated that Youth A came downstairs and\n“tried to push” her in order to get into the office to retrieve her\nChrome Book. Supervisor 1 reported during the incident, Youth A\nrefused to go back upstairs and “shoved” her when trying to get\ninto the office to ger her Chrome Book. The report had no\ndocumentation of injuries to Youth A, nor any report that she had\nbeen “assaulted” or “pinned down” by staff. The report referenced\nan interview of Youth A, but it was not included in the report.\nRequests for any additional information relative to the incident\nhave resulted in no further LE documentation.\nEmployee HR File of Staff 1 – Staff 1 was hired on 8/7/23 as a\npart time employee and transitioned to full time on 9/4/23. She\nreceived a written notice of discipline and coaching on 12/14/2023\nfor disruptive activity (oversharing of personal information). No\nother disciplinary action was noted in the HR file. Staff 1 was\nterminated from HOLA effective 1/03/2024 as a result of not\ncalling and/or not showing for schedule day of employment and\nbreach of code of ethics.\nAnalysis After the conclusion of the investigation, there was sufficient\nevidence to support non-compliance with licensing rule 4158-1-a-\nii. Although the staff denied the allegations, two youth were\ninterviewed, and both reported that the staff grabbed Youth A and\npinned her down to the bed in an attempt to take the chrome book\nfrom her. Review of the police report did not document injuries to\nYouth A, nor did it document her report of being “pinned down” by\nstaff. However, during the interview of Youth A, she reported that\nshe did not report the actions of the staff to LE.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n01/08/2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nCassandra Thomas Date\n5",
