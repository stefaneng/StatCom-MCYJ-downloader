Therapist reported a family therapy session and\ntreatment plan meeting was held on 2/5/24 with him, Youth A,\nMother, and Behavior Analyst. During the meeting, Youth A\nshared feelings he is mistreated at the facility. Youth A explained\nhe feels that way because he feels other youth get away with\nthings and staff members have favorite youth on the unit, but he’s\nnot one of them. Therapist stated Youth A reported during the\nmeeting Staff 1 had threatened him, but he didn’t tell anyone\nabout what happened at the time. Therapist reported Youth A\nrefused to provide any other details about the situation. Therapist\nreported Youth A alluded to the fact he had a plan or scheme in\nplace and didn’t want to share any details with anyone because he\nwould “make it right” on his own. Therapist reported Youth A\nimplied there was another staff member aware of the situation with\nStaff 1 but wouldn’t disclose the staff member’s name.\nBehavior Analyst (BA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 2/6/24. BA reported during the treatment planning\nportion of the meeting they held on 2/5/24, Youth A had a\nrebuttal/combative response for every goal they went over. One of\nthe goals, Youth A said, “well how am I supposed to work on [this\ngoal] if Staff 1 says ‘if you come out of your room one more time,\nI’m going to hit you?’” BA reported they asked Youth A when this\noccurred, but he couldn’t provide a timeline, and instead said, “it\nhappens all the time”. BA reported Therapist asked Youth A why\nhe didn’t’ previously report it and Youth A said he reported it to a\nstaff member but wouldn’t disclose who. Youth A then told them\nthe staff member he disclosed this to told him “We aren’t going to\nsay anything. It can be between us, and I’m going to say anything\nto anyone else”. BA reported Youth A said he had a plan for Staff\n1 to get what was coming to her but wouldn’t disclose what the\nplan was. BA reported all of Youth A’s previous complaints have\nbeen staff members play favorites and he always gets in trouble.\nMother was interviewed via phone on 2/12/24. Mother is\nYouth A’s mother. Mother reported Youth A has been making\ncomplaints about Staff 1 since he arrived at the facility. Mother\nreported Youth A has often alleged staff members have favorites.\nMother reported during the meeting on 2/5/24, Youth A stated\nStaff 1 said “If you keep getting in someone’s business, I’m going\nto fuck you up” or “I’m going to whoop your ass myself”. Mother\n2",
    "reported she couldn’t remember which wording he used because\nshe didn’t write verbatim what he said.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/12/24.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 threatened him around September 2023.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 said “If you don’t get in the shower this\nmorning, then you can’t go to school. If you don’t go to school, I’ll\nhit you personally.” Youth A reported he thinks that’s what she\nsaid, but he can’t remember a lot because it’s been a while. Youth\nA reported he couldn’t remember if any other staff or youth were\npresent when she said this. Youth A reported when Staff 1 said\nthis to him, he didn’t feel threatened because Staff 1 acts big and\nscary, but he’s not scared of her. Youth A reported he can’t\nremember much about anything else she’s done but suggested\ntalking to Staff 2. Youth A reported he discloses all his complaints,\nincluding this one, to Staff 2. Youth A reported Staff 2 told him\nthey weren’t going to do anything about it yet, but she would help\nlater. Youth A reported Staff 2 told him she was going to keep\ntrack of all the things Staff 1 does wrong, so she can talk to\nsomeone all at once about the concerns. Youth A reported he did\nnot tell anyone else about the incident.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/12/24.\nStaff 1 reported she does not remember any incident surrounding\nYouth A not taking a shower or giving her problems about taking a\nshower before school in the morning. Staff 1 reported she has\nnever threatened him in any type of way. Staff 1 reported she\ndoesn’t even joke with youth in that manner because she doesn’t\nknow what they’ve been through, and youth take it too far. Staff 1\nreported she is aware because of the position she holds; she\ncannot get mad and say anything she wants to towards the youth.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 2/12/24. Staff 2 reported\nwhenever Youth A has had concerns, she has encouraged him to\ntalk to Therapist or a supervisor. Staff 2 reported she has never\nheard Staff 1 threaten to physically harm Youth A or threaten him\nin any other way. Staff 2 reported Youth A has never told her\nanyone, including Staff 1, has threatened to physically harm him,\nor threatened him in any other way. Staff 2 reported she is not\nkeeping a list of things Staff 1 does wrong, and she has no idea\nwhy Youth A got that impression.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Wedgwood Christian Services Behavior Management\nProcedures – Prohibited Techniques (rev. 4/18/18) states\ncorporal or physical punishment or threatening to use any\n3",
    "of these methods is prohibited. It also states the use of\nprofanity against a client is prohibited.\n• There are no incident reports or shift logs documenting\nanything about this alleged incident in September 2023.\n• The facility does not have the schedule from September\n2023 to see who might have been working during the same\nshifts as Staff 1 and may have been witness to the alleged\nincident.\n• Staff 1 has no disciplinary records in her employee file.\nStaff 1 completed Decreasing Behavior training on 5/14/23,\nand Behavioral Challenges of Autism training on 5/25/23.\nShe also completed AEGIS trainings on 4/9/20, 9/17/20,\n5/27/21, 9/16/21, 11/18/21, 5/12/22, 2/5/23, 5/15/23 and\n11/20/23.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established as there is no evidence to support Staff\n1 threatened Youth A. Youth A provided minimal details about the\nincident and stated Staff 2 would have more information.\nHowever, Staff 2 reported Youth A never told her Staff 1\nthreatened him in any type of way and has never heard Staff 1\nthreaten Youth A. Staff 1 reported she has never threatened\nYouth A and is aware she cannot say anything threatening in a\njoking or serious manner towards the youth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nFebruary 16, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 21, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
