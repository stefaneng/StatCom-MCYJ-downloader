    "his sentences on 6/12/2025. Youth A stated he doesn’t remember\nmuch from the incident on 6/12/2025. He recalled initially being\nrestrained by unknown staff and being handcuffed. He does recall\nnot being able to move his muscles. He stated once he was in\nMax II, the seclusion room, he recalls trying to close the door and\nall the staff were trying to stop him.

He stated he did tell Staff 3\nthat his leg was hurting and thought it was broken. He reported he\nkept asking Staff 3 if he was going to take him to the hospital. He\nstated Staff 3 ignored him and left him in the room. He reported\nthis was the first time he had been restrained.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n7/2/2025. Supervisor 1 stated she started her shift at 3:00pm on\n6/12/2025. She recalled at 4:00pm, Youth A had sentences to turn\nin due to receiving discipline from a previous incident that was\nassigned by Staff 3. She asked Youth A if he completed his\nsentences and he told her he was not done and he was not going\nto his room. She tried to speak with him about completing his\nsentences and Youth A said he was not giving her the sentences,\nand they were somewhere in the toilet. She offered to give him\nanother piece of discipline paper and use a pencil, but he refused.\nDue to his refusal, she called for the floor to be cleared and the\nother youth to go back to their rooms. Once all youth were off the\nfloor, Supervisor 2 and herself continued to talk to him, but Youth\nA didn’t respond. Supervisor 1 then requested for Supervisor 2 to\ntalk to Youth A alone, however, Youth A was still not responding\nand would not comply with any directives. Supervisor 1 then gave\ndirections to Staff 4 and Staff 5 to escort him to Max II. Supervisor\n1 gave Youth A the option to walk to the Max room on his own, but\nhe did not get up out of his seat. She stated Staff 4 and Staff 5\neach stood on the side of Youth A, put their arms under his arms\nand lifted him out of his seat. Youth A fell to the ground and would\nnot get back up. Youth A began kicking staff and rolling around on\nthe floor. She then instructed Staff 4 and Staff 5 to put handcuffs\non Youth A. Once the handcuffs were on, Staff 4 and Staff 5\npicked up Youth A from the ground and escorted him to the\nseclusion room. Supervisor 1, Staff 4 and Staff 5 attempted to\ntake the handcuffs off Youth A but Youth A kept moving his arms\naround and wouldn’t let them take the handcuffs off. When staff\ntried to exit the room, Youth A was grabbing on their legs and\narms. Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 4 and Staff 5, and Supervisor 1 had to\nleave the room one-by-one, as Youth A would not let them go.\nYouth A attempted to put his body between the door so that staff\n3",
    "would be unable to close it. Eventually, all staff were able to leave\nthe room and leave Youth A in the room. Supervisor 1 instructed\nStaff 1 to monitor Youth A through the door window. She stated\nYouth A was hitting his head on the door window. He was also\njumping, yelling, screaming, drooling, and foaming at the mouth.\nShe stated Youth A was not listening to staff orders, and he was\nnot verbally responding, but making moaning noises. He\neventually wore himself out and laid down in front of the door and\nappeared to be asleep. She gave directions for Staff 1, Staff 4 and\nStaff 5 to enter the room to remove the handcuffs. Once staff\nentered the room, Youth A became upset again. He began to\nresist and wouldn’t allow them to take off his handcuffs. She\nradioed Supervisor 2 and Staff 3 to put the other youth down in\ntheir room on the treatment unit and requested additional help.\nStaff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, Supervisor 1 and\nSupervisor 2 assisted with getting Youth A on the ground and\ngetting his handcuffs off. She stated Youth A kept grabbing staff\nankles and legs, and this caused everyone to fall over one\nanother. Eventually all staff were able to leave the room.\nSupervisor 1 recalled it was very difficult to get Youth A to comply\nwith any directive and he was verbally not responding the entire\ntime. She did not observe any bruises or swelling on Youth A’s\nbody. Youth A did not complain about being in pain. Supervisor 1\nstated she had to leave the building and go to the Emergency\nRoom (ER) due to Youth A falling on her leg when trying to get the\nhandcuffs off him. Supervisor 1 did not feel it was necessary for\nYouth A to seek medical treatment.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/2/2025.\nStaff 1 stated on 6/12/2025, she was in the dayroom with the\nyouth on the detention unit and they all were playing games and\ndoing different activities while on their break. Staff 1 stated\nsometime before 6:00pm, Youth A was asked to go to his room by\nSupervisor 1 because he didn’t finish his sentences. Youth A\nrefused and Supervisor 1 told Staff 4 to remove the other youth\nfrom the unit. Youth A was sitting in the chair and did not respond\nverbally. Staff 4 and Staff 5 took Youth A under each arm and\nwhile attempting to lift him up, Youth A fell to the floor. She began\nholding Youth’s A legs because he started kicking at staff and she\nwas trying to keep him still. She recalls someone mentioning\nputting handcuffs on Youth A but doesn’t recall who gave the\norder. Once the handcuffs were on, Staff 4 and Staff 5 escorted\nYouth A to Max II while Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, Staff 2 and\nherself followed behind. She stated once Youth A was in the room\nit became tug of war with him. Youth A was throwing himself and\nhis body around on the floor while they were trying to get the\n4",
    "handcuffs off him. Once the handcuffs were off, and all staff were\nable to leave the room, she monitored Youth A through the door\nwindow. She stated Youth A was taking his handcuffs and\nbanging them up against the glass door window, scraping his\nhandcuffs on the wall, and banging his head all over the room.\nThrough the window, she kept telling Youth A that it would be\nokay and letting him know that it was okay to cry. Staff 1 felt as if\nhe was dealing with something emotionally. Youth A did state to\nher that he did not want to talk. Youth A tired himself out, sat\ndown, and started to fall asleep on the floor. She told Supervisor 1\nhe was asleep. Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4\nand Staff 5 all entered the room. Youth A woke up and he became\nuncooperative again. Youth A was grabbing on all staff legs as\nthey were trying to exit the room. Youth A was not hurting staff,\nbut he would not let them go and was very clingy. He began to cry\nand that is when Supervisor 2 and Staff 3 were able to exit the\nroom. Staff 1 did not observe Youth A with a black eye and there\nwas no bleeding or bruising on his wrists from the handcuffs. She\ndid observe him limping when he came out of the room to take a\nshower. Staff 3 and Staff 6 were escorting him, and she overheard\nStaff 6 state Youth A’s leg looked swollen. When Staff 1 saw\nYouth A the next day, he was walking completely fine.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/2/2025.\nStaff 2 stated he was on the treatment unit when he received a\ncall on the radio to come to detention and it was an emergency.\nWhen he entered the detention unit, Youth A was sitting in a chair,\nhowever, he was not aware of what happened to receive\nassistance on the detention unit. Youth A was refusing to speak,\nanswer or go to his room. Supervisor 1 instructed all staff to go to\nthe control room so that she could talk to Youth A alone. Staff\nwere in the control room for about 15-20 minutes, and they were\ncalled out of the room and Youth A was not complying with orders.\nStaff 4 and Staff 5 put their arm under each of Youth’s A arms,\nand when they stood Youth A up, Youth A started to kick and staff,\nand Youth A fell to the ground. While on the ground, staff kept\ntelling Youth A to calm down, however, Youth A was fighting and\nkicking staff. He recalls someone saying to put handcuffs on\nYouth A, but he does not recall who. Youth A was escorted to Max\nII and he was fighting staff the entire time. When staff tried to take\nthe handcuffs off Youth A, Youth A would not let them do it.\nSupervisor 1 stated to leave the handcuffs on, and staff exited the\nroom.

At\nsome point, Youth A laid down and Supervisor 1 instructed to take\nthe handcuffs of him. Youth A would not let them take the\n5",
    "handcuffs of him and he was grabbing on staff legs and arms.\nYouth A would also not let staff leave out the room and he would\nget in between the door to prevent it from closing. This occurred\nfor 20-30 minutes. Youth A eventually started to break down and\ncry, and he let all staff leave the room. Youth A laid down and was\nquiet. Youth A never expressed that he was in any type of pain.\nHe did not have a black eye, any bruising or bleeding from his\nwrist and no bleeding from his head/forehead area.

On 6/12/2025, in the dayroom, Youth A was asked by\nSupervisor 1 if he completed his sentences, after Youth A stated\nthat he didn’t, Supervisor 1 told him to go to his room to finish the\nsentences and Youth A refused. Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 4, Staff 5,\nSupervisor 1, Supervisor 2 and herself all tried to process with\nYouth A for over twenty minutes. Staff kept asking him to go to his\nroom to complete his sentences. Staff went into the control room\nwhile Supervisor 2 sat in the dayroom and talked to Youth A for a\none-on-one conversation. Supervisor 1 checked to see if any\nprogress was made and Youth A still refused to comply. All staff\ncame out of the control room and were instructed to escort Youth\nA to Max II. Staff 4 and Staff 5 were interlocked with Youth A,\nhowever, Youth A would not walk. Youth A started swinging his\narms, and Staff 4, Staff 5 and Youth A all fell to the ground. Youth\nA was on the floor and throwing his body around. Staff 3 grabbed\nhis left leg and Staff 1 grabbed his right leg so that he would stop\nkicking staff. Staff 1 and herself had one hand on the back of\nYouth’s A ankle and one hand on the back of his kneecap. They\napplied pressure to his superficial peroneal. She recalls staff\nputting handcuffs on Youth A but she did not recall which staff.\nAfter about 15 minutes, Youth A calmed down and when staff\npicked him back up, he began kicking again. Once Staff 3 and\nStaff 4 took Youth A to Max II, Youth A kept grabbing on staff legs\nand would not let them leave out of the room. Once staff were\nable to leave the room, Youth A was able to get his handcuffs in\nfront of him and was hitting his handcuffs on the door window\nwhile also running and charging at the door and banging his head.\nYouth A started to bite at his handcuffs. Staff 1 took over watching\nhim as Youth A was upset that Staff 3 assigned him the\nsentences. Staff 3 went back to the treatment unit while Staff 1\ncontinued to monitor Youth A. Supervisor 1 called for Staff 3 to\n6",
    "come back, as Youth A was calm and she wanted to get his\nhandcuffs off. Youth A began resisting when one handcuff was off\nand Supervisor 1 radioed for youth to be put in their rooms and\nneeded additional assistance. Youth A wouldn’t allow staff to close\nthe door once his handcuffs were off, and he kept grabbing on\nstaff. Youth A put his body in between the door and staff were not\nable to close the door.
