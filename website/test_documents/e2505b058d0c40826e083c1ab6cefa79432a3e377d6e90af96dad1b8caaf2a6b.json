    "Incident #2\nStaff member slept with 18-year-old youth that was recently moved to a new\nplacement.\nINVESTIGATION:\nIncident #1\nOn 6/24/22 the allegation was reported to DCWL. The complainant was contacted\nby phone for additional information and reported the agency just became aware of\nthe allegation, although it reportedly happened several months prior. In\napproximately February 2022 Staff 1 reportedly messaged Youth A on “WhatsApp”\nstating the youth could contact him at any time if she needed anything. Staff 1 then\nsent Youth A a friend request for “SnapChat”. Staff 1 then asked Youth A to send\nnude photos via SnapChat. Youth A did not send any photos. However, Staff 1 sent\na photo of himself in his underwear. It was further reported that on an unknown date\nStaff 1 text Youth A requesting “cuddles” after the death of his grandmother and\nbreakup with his girlfriend. Youth A declined any contact with Staff 1. Staff 1 then\nblocked Youth A on SnapChat. Since that time, Staff 1 went to Youth A’s apartment\nand spoke with the other girls that live there. Youth A was uncomfortable with this.\nThe girl’s apartment is a staffed Independent Living Plus (ILP) placement.\nProgram Director\nProgram Director was contacted by phone on 6/24/2022. Director was aware of the\nallegations and reported Staff 1 was placed on leave pending investigation. Director\nreported DHHS was notified of the allegation.

House Manager asked Youth A if she was ok and inquired on why she\nwaited so long to report the incident to anyone. Youth A said it happened in\nFebruary 2022, but she felt the problem would just go away. Youth A reported to\nHouse Manager that Staff 1 had messaged her on social media, asked for nudes,\nand sent a photo of himself without a shirt. Youth A also reported feeling\nuncomfortable with Staff 1 being at her house. House Manager clarified that Staff 1\ndoes not work in the “girls house” where Youth A lives with three roommates. Staff 1\nworks two doors down in the “boys house”. However, as this is ILP, staff and youth\nhave contact with one another and occasionally plan activities together.\nYouth A\nAn interview was conducted on-site by DHHS and DCWL on 6/27/22.\nYouth A reported in February 2022 Staff 1 text her “if you ever need anything, I’m\nhere for you”. Youth A responded, “ok, thank you”. Staff 1 then asked her to add\nhim on SnapChat, which she did. Youth A stated she did not know the rules about\nstaff and youth having contact. After adding him on SnapChat, Staff 1 immediately\nmessaged her. The messages were friendly in the beginning. Then he began\n3",
    "sharing personal information, such as the fact his grandmother died. Youth A replied\nwith condolences. Staff 1 then sent her a message stating he needed “cuddles” to\nfeel better and wanted to see her. Youth A replied no. Staff 1 then apologized to her,\nthrough a video message in which he was wearing boxers and no shirt. Youth A did\nnot respond. Staff 1 then asked Youth A to send nude photos; she replied no. Staff 1\nthen blocked Youth A on the SnapChat app. Youth A could not provide any of these\nmessages as SnapChat messages disappear after reading. However, Youth A did\nshow the message from Staff 1, requesting that she add him on SnapChat. Youth A\nstated that after he blocked her from the app, she confronted him using another app,\nbut he pretended not to know what Youth A was talking about. Youth A showed the\ntexts to DHHS and DCWL. In the messages, Youth A told Staff 1 he was being\ninappropriate. Staff 1 indicated he did not know what she meant. Since that time,\nStaff 1 has avoided her, but he does talk with other girls in her house. Youth A\nreported she has been confrontational toward Staff 1 as she is upset about the\nincident and does not want him to do that with any of the other girls in the house.\nYouth A recalled that she began arguing with Staff 1 recently, after he made a\ncomment to another youth about Youth A being disrespectful. Staff 2 was present\nduring the argument and asked Staff 1 to leave the house. Youth A reported the\nincident to Staff 3. Youth A also informed Staff 3 about the messages Staff 1 had\npreviously sent. Youth A did not want to tell anyone before, as she felt she handled it\nand did not want him to get fired over it. After the argument, Youth A changed her\nmind and felt someone should know what happened.\nYouth B\nAn interview was conducted on-site by DHHS and DCWL on 6/27/22.\nYouth B reported she never observed any staff act inappropriately with youth.

Youth C reported being part of\nthe group chat with youth and staff, which included Staff 1. Youth C was not aware\nof Staff 1 contacting any youth individually. However, Youth A once told Youth C that\nStaff 1 was upset with her for refusing to go out with him. Youth C did not know any\nother details and felt Youth A was lying about the situation. Youth C reported\nknowing Youth A for a long time, stating that Youth A exaggerates and is not truthful.\nYouth D\nAn interview was conducted on-site by DHHS and DCWL on 6/27/22.\n4",
    "Youth D moved to the ILP house March 2022. Therefore, she was not part of the\nhouse at the time the incident allegedly occurred. Youth D denied observing any\ninappropriate actions by staff. Youth D did not have any concerns regarding Staff 1.\nYouth E\nAn interview was conducted by phone with Youth E on 7/12/22.

However, Youth A did show Staff\n2 the texts with Staff 1, where Youth A said he was being inappropriate, but Staff 1\nindicated he did not know what Youth A was talking about. Staff 2 reported that she\ndid not have any concerns about Staff 1 and had not witnessed him being\ninappropriate with any youth. Staff 2 noted that Staff 1 seems close with all of the\nyouth. However, she noticed he has been particularly helpful with Youth D lately, as\nYouth D is new to the program, has a baby, and does not speak English. Staff 2 did\nnot find this suspicious but stated she will pay more attention and report if any\ninteractions seem inappropriate.\nStaff 3\nAn interview was conducted on-site by DHHS and DCWL on 7/7/22.\nStaff 3 reported she is the supervisor of staff that work in the boys ILP home. Staff 3\nwas aware of the allegation but had never observed any inappropriate actions by\nStaff 1. Staff 3 did not have any concerns about Staff 1’s behavior toward the youth\nin the girl’s home. However, Staff 3 noted that Staff 1 had been very active in helping\nYouth D with her child. While this was unusual, it did not seem concerning. Staff 3\nstated Staff 1 was on a corrective action plan as of March 2022 due to attendance\nissues. But there were no other concerns. Staff 1 worked well with youth and was\nvery supportive. Regarding boundaries between staff and youth, Staff 3 stated the\nstaff handbook outlines what is/is not acceptable. Staff and youth cannot be friends\noutside of agency work/activities and no social media contact except for the group\nchat with staff and youth. Staff 3 noted the agency is working on clarifying this\npolicy.\nStaff 4\nAn interview was conducted on-site by DHHS and DCWL on 7/7/22.\nStaff 4 reported working several shifts with Staff 1. Staff 4 never observed any\ninappropriate behavior or relationships between Staff 1 and any youth. Staff 4 had\nnot heard any youth report feeling uncomfortable around Staff 1.\n5",
    "Staff 5\nAn interview was conducted on-site by DHHS and DCWL on 7/7/22\nStaff 5 reported being present during the incident where Youth A became upset and\nbegan yelling at Staff 1. Youth A was out of the room, then suddenly came in, yelling\nat Staff 1 for talking about her to a peer. However, Staff 1 was not talking about\nYouth A. Staff 5 stated Youth A frequently accuses people of talking about her, even\nwhen they are not. Staff 5 reported that Staff 1 did tell Youth A she was being\nimmature and rude to staff. Which further upset Youth A. Staff 1 was not yelling or\nbeing rude when he said this. Staff 1 was trying to coach Youth A about how her\nbehavior was seen by others. However, Youth A then began yelling about Staff 1\nbeing “weird” with girls online. Staff 5 messaged her supervisor for assistance. Staff\n5 denied witnessing any inappropriate action or relationships between staff and\nyouth. Staff 5 reported Staff 1 has been very helpful with residents as he speaks\nSpanish, which helps him connect with youth. When asked about agency policy\nabout staff/youth having contact on social media, Staff 5 reported the policy is\nunclear.\nStaff 7\nStaff 7 denied witnessing or hearing of any inappropriate contact between youth\nand staff. Youth A reported to Staff 7 that Staff 1 made her uncomfortable by some\nmessages they exchanged. However, Staff 7 did not see the messages and had no\nother information.\nStaff 1\nAn interview was conducted at Staff 1’s apartment by DHHS and DCWL on 7/7/22.\nStaff 1 was aware of the allegations and denied sending any inappropriate or sexual\nmessages, or photos of himself in his underwear. Staff 1 reported there is a big\ngroup text on WhatsApp for staff and youth to communicate. However, some youth\nhave used his phone number from the group chat to look him up on other social\nmedia apps and add him. Staff 1 reported he and Youth A were friends on\nSnapChat. Staff 1 stated Youth A sent him the request. However, after DHHS\nshowed the screenshot of the request from him to Youth A, he agreed that he was\nthe one who requested Youth A add him. Staff 1 did not have a reason for why he\nasked Youth A to connect via this app. However, he stated that the youth in the\nboy’s home, and other youth that have moved on from the program, contact him on\nSnapChat and Instagram as they are the most popular apps right now. Staff 1 stated\nhe tries to connect with the youth in different ways and be available to them, as they\nare all refugees and do not have a support system. Many youth do not speak\nEnglish, so he also helps them when there is a language barrier. When asked about\nYouth D, Staff 1 reported he has a good rapport with Youth D. Youth D has\nstruggled with some staff and with the language barrier. Staff 1 has tried to help\nYouth D with understanding school, the IL program, and watching her child at the\nILP house on occasion, so Youth D can have some time to herself. Staff 1 stated the\nagency does not have any clear rules about any of that, so he did not believe it was\na problem. Staff 1 felt that Youth D was more comfortable with asking for him to\n6",
    "help, as he speaks her language and it is easier to communicate. Staff 1 stated he is\nonly being helpful and nothing more. Staff 1 denied any type of relationship with\nYouth D or any youth.\nRegarding Youth A, Staff 1 denied the allegations. Staff 1 reported Youth A always\nseemed upset with him and other staff, because she felt the were showing favoritism\ntoward other youth, and not her. Youth A frequently seemed agitated and spoke\nrudely to staff. Staff 1 indicated she was more “entitled” with male staff and would\nswear at staff and tell them what to do. There was one incident recently where Youth\nA began yelling at Staff 1, in front of other youth. Staff 1 asked Youth A to stop, but\nshe kept escalating the situation. Staff 1 told Youth A she was being disrespectful.\nYouth A became more upset, yelling, swearing, making rude comments. Staff 1 left\nthe house to end the situation. Youth A later made this allegation about Staff 1. Staff\n1 again denied the allegations. Staff 1 stated that he and Youth A had messaged\nbriefly on SnapChat a few months ago. Youth A initiated the conversation, by asking\nhim to take her shopping. Staff 1 told Youth A it would have to be during work hours.\nYouth A asked again and Staff 1 responded he was busy with work, college, and\nfamily obligations as the great-grandmother passed away. Youth A told him that she\nwas there for him if he wanted to talk. Staff 1 said thank you, ended the\nconversation. Later that night Youth A text him again, asking what the was doing.\nStaff 1 answered he was going to bed. Youth A asked if he was still upset about his\ngrandma, then again said she was there for him. Staff 1 denied sending any\nmessages about cuddling. As SnapChat is a video messaging app, Staff 1 did send\none reply to Youth A while sitting on his bed, but it only showed his face and\nshoulders, and he had a shirt on. Staff 1 stated there was nothing sexual or\ninappropriate about the messages. Staff 1 denied requesting nude photos from\nYouth A. Staff 1 stated he has not messaged with Youth A since that time.\nStaff 1 reported the agency policy about social media is not clear. The employee\nhandbook mentions relationships not being allowed but did not detail what type of\ncontact was or was not ok, as staff build these supportive, mentoring relationships\nwith refugee youth. Staff 1 reported being on leave from work and did not know\nwhen he would be returning. DHHS wrote a safety plan, which Staff 1 agreed to: no\nsocial media contact with youth, no photos to youth, and to notify supervisor of any\nperceived flirtation or weird contact from youth.\nDocuments reviewed\nOn 6/27/22 a site visit occurred at the agency. HR documents for Staff 1 were\nreviewed. Staff 1’s file did not have documentation of any prior concerns related to\nthis allegation. However, he was on a corrective action plan due to attendance\nissues. It was also noted Staff 1 signed agency policies/procedures from the\nemployee handbook on 12/30/21.\nThe agency employee handbook was reviewed regarding staff and youth contact on\nsocial media. On page 12, the policy states “employees are responsible to use good\njudgement and exercise personal responsibility when posting online”. The policy\n7",

Staff 6 was\nimmediately placed on leave pending investigation.\nYouth A\nDuring the interview on 6/27/22, Youth A reported hearing information that a male\nyouth (Youth E) in Independent Living, had sex with an employee (Staff 6). Youth A\nstated that the boys and girl’s houses had a skating event in June 2022. Youth E\nwas invited to the event, even though he had recently moved out of the ILP house\nand into his own apartment with Youth F. During the skating event, Youth E told\nYouth A that he had sex with Staff 6. Youth E reportedly said they were going to\nhave sex again that night after the skating event. Staff 6 was then observed giving\nYouth E a ride to his apartment after the event. Youth A stated she did not tell\nanyone as she thought they would not believe her. Youth A also reported that she\ndid not get along well with Staff 6, as she felt Staff 6 did not like her and favored\nother youth. Staff 6 was Youth A’s assigned life skills coach, but never made time to\nmeet with her. Staff 6 also told Youth A that she was rude and had an attitude, which\nmade Youth A unwilling to work with Staff 6 anymore. Youth A also reported she did\nnot get along well with Youth E due to some conflict they had several months ago.\nYouth A and Youth E were friends, until Youth E was rude towards her. Youth A\nstated she did not have any proof about a relationship with Staff 6 and Youth E but\nfelt it should still be reported.\nYouth B, C and D\nYouths B, C and D did not report any concerns regarding Staff 6 and Youth E. Two\nof the youth were not placed in the ILP home until after Youth E left the program.\nStaff 2\nStaff 2 reported she did not observe any inappropriate behavior with Staff 6 and\nYouth E. Staff 2 stated Staff 6 was always assigned to work in the girl’s home. Youth\nE and Youth F were placed in the boys ILP house, but not willing to work with their\nassigned coach. Therefore, Staff 6 agreed to help Youth E and F find an apartment,\nsign a lease, gather items to furnish the apartment, and complete some other tasks.\nAt the same time, Youth A was not getting along with Staff 6 and refused to\nparticipate in activities planned by Staff 6. Youth A felt she was not getting enough of\nthe Staff A’s attention but would not acknowledge her part in the problem. Staff 2\nstated she can see how Youth A may have felt at the time that Staff 6 was spending\ntoo much time with Youth E.\n8",
    "Staff 3, 4 & 5\nDuring the interviews on 7/7/22, Staff 3, 4 & 5 did not report any concerns regarding\nStaff 6 or Youth E.\nStaff 1\nDuring the interview on 7/7/22, Staff 1 reported he had not heard anything regarding\na relationship or inappropriate contact with Staff 6 and Youth E. However, he then\nrecalled a time that seemed unusual, where he ran into Youth F at a taco stand one\nnight. Youth F told Staff 1 that he had to get out of the apartment because he felt\nuncomfortable with Staff 6 being there with Youth E. Staff 1 stated this was on a\nweekend, late at night. Youth F did not provide any further details. Staff 1 stated he\nwas aware that Staff 6 was not working that night. Staff 1 had just finished a shift\nand knew Staff 6 was not on duty. Staff 1 further stated there was another night\nwhen he drove by Youth E and F’s apartment and observed Staff 6’s car there,\nbetween 5-6PM. Staff 1 was unsure if Staff 6 was working that night. Staff 1 stated\nthat the more he thought about it, Staff 6 and Youth E did seem close. Youth E\nwould only accept help from Staff 6 and not any other staff. When Youth E\ngraduated, he insisted on sitting with Staff 6 at dinner. Youth E would even refer to\nStaff 6 as his “girlfriend”, although it was perceived as a joke. Staff 1 clarified that he\nnever saw any inappropriate contact or conversation. However, Staff 6 and Youth E\ndid seem close.\nStaff 6\nAn interview was conducted by phone, by DHHS and DCWL on 7/12/22. Staff 6\nreported being a Life Coach for the ILP program since November 2021. Staff 6\ndenied witnessing, hearing of, or participating in any inappropriate relationships with\nyouth in the program. Staff 6 reported the agency does not explicitly state staff and\nyouth cannot communicate via social media. Staff 6 reported asking agency\nleadership about adding youth on Facebook or maintaining contact after youth\ngraduate the program. However, leadership did not have a concrete answer. Staff 6\nstated the agency needs to clarify expectations because some youth need more\nattention and support as they do not have any friends or family in this country. Staff\n6 clarified that she does not spend time with youth outside of her work hours. Staff 6\nworks 40 hours a week and flexes those hours to incorporate the time she assists\nyouth that may be outside of the typical business hours.\nStaff 6 was aware of an allegation towards her and indicated she was on leave\npending investigation. Staff 6 denied the allegation, stating she was not sure why\nsomeone would say that. Staff 6 reported she and Youth E are close in a\nprofessional way. Youth E had a conflict with his assigned life coach, therefore Staff\n6 stepped in to help with some tasks, since they had a good rapport. Staff 6 gave\nYouth E her personal phone number after he graduated and left the ILP program, as\nshe felt he could use continued support. Youth E reached out to Staff 6 on her work\nphone to ask for help finding an apartment and other things. He once contacted her\non her personal phone to ask for a ride when leaving a party, where his friends had\nbeen drinking. Staff 6 picked Youth E up and took him home around 11-11:30PM,\n9",
    "counting that time as work time. This occurred on a Saturday night in June 2022.\nStaff 6 stated Youth E initially called the ILP house staff for a ride, even though he\nwas no longer in ILP, but no one answered. Which was why he called Staff 6. Staff 6\ndenied ever going to Youth E’s apartment socially. Staff 6 helped Youth E and F\nobtain their apartment and move in one evening until approximately 11:00PM. Staff\n6 reported that all of her contacts with Youth E were professional.\nStaff 6 did not believe anyone thought she and Youth E had a relationship other than\nprofessional. Although she felt that Youth A may say this in an attempt to cause a\nproblem. Youth A and Youth E do not get along. They were initially friends, until\nsomething unknown happened and Youth A’s demeanor changed. Staff 6 stated\nYouth A is not someone to forgive and forget. Youth A will get a bad first impression\nand hold on to it. Staff 6 has observed Youth A yelling, swearing, and speaking\nrudely to Youth E and about him when he was not present. Staff 6 was also\nassigned as Youth A’s life coach, but Youth A did not like the way that Staff 6 tried to\ncoach her. Staff 6 tried to put responsibility on Youth A, while providing guidance to\nachieve tasks. Youth A seemed to not like Staff 6 or interacting with her. However,\nStaff 6 continued trying to work with Youth A. Staff 6 stated that it may appear she\ndid not spend as much time with Youth A, as Youth A refused to engage in services.\nYouth E\nAn interview was conducted by phone, by DHHS and DCWL on 7/13/22, as Youth E\nis unavailable in person most days from 5:00am to 5:30pm due to work.

Youth E denied having Staff 6 or any staff at his apartment socially.\nYouth E recalled Staff 6 helped him move in, and once gave him a ride home from a\nparty when his friend at the party had been drinking. Staff 6 was at the apartment\nbriefly to drop him off, but she did not stay long. Youth E stated he did not have a car\nat the time and tried calling ILP house staff, but they did not answer. Youth E has\nsince obtained a car and does not need to ask staff for help. Youth E stated he\noccasionally spent time with other youth from the ILP house. Although he noted he\ndid not have a good relationship with Youth A. Youth E and Youth A were friends\npreviously, but she “changed”. Youth E would say hello to Youth A and she would\nignore him or become angry with him. Youth E stated he avoids Youth A because he\ndoes not want to argue with her. Youth E indicated he would never tell Youth A\nanything personal as they are not close that way. Youth E denied ever telling Youth\nA about a relationship with Staff 6.\nYouth F\nAn attempt was made by DHHS and DCWL to complete a phone interview with\nYouth F on 7/12/22, as he was out of state. A message was left and Youth F later\ncontacted DHHS.
