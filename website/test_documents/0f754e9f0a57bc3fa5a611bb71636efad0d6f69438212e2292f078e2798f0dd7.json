    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff member disrespected/belittled Youth A by threatening to\nassault Youth A and calling Youth A \"little bitch\".\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Youth A by phone with the assistance of an\ninterpreter on 05/01/2025. Youth A proceeded to describe the\nincident involving Youth B that was investigated as a part of\nspecial investigation #2025SIC0000382. When Youth A was\nasked if anything was said or done to Youth A, Youth A stated\n\"no\".\nI interviewed Chief Administrator by telephone on 02/25/2025.\nChief Administrator reported Youth A has been discharged from\nthe program and Staff 1 was suspended following an incident\ninvolving Youth B and terminated following the completion of an\nagency investigation of the incident. These allegations related to\nStaff 1's interaction/communication with Youth A are very similar\nto the complaint involving Staff 1's interaction/communication with\nYouth B that were investigated in special investigation\n#2025SIC0000382. The agency was found in noncompliance in\nthat special investigation as determined by the\nbehavior/communication of Staff 1.\nAn attempt to interview Staff 1 was made, but an interview was\nnot possible/completed due to Staff 1 no longer having phone\nservice and no longer being employed by the agency.\nI interviewed Compliance Staff by phone on 4/14/2025.\nCompliance Staff had conducted/completed an agency\ninvestigation involving the interactions/communications between\nStaff 1 and Youth B. Compliance Staff stated the outcome of the\nagency investigation determined Staff 1 had violated agency\npolicy in Staff 1's interactions/communication with Youth B.\nI interviewed Program Manager by telephone on 04/15/2025.\nProgram Manager stated he did not observe the incident under\ninvestigation. Program Manager described Youth A and Youth B\nas being very active/involved in each other's business due to their\nshared language, culture, and circumstances. Program Manager\ndescribed it was typical that whatever happened with Youth A or\nYouth B, the other would be involved either directly or indirectly.\nI interviewed Staff 2, Youth C, Youth D, Youth E, and Youth F\nat the agency/facility on 04/30/2025. None of those interviewed\n2",
    "reported seeing or hearing Staff 1 confronting/belittling Youth A or\ncalling Youth A names as reported in the allegation.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI received and reviewed the agency’s incident investigation report\ninvolving the actions of Staff 1 including an audio recording of an\nincident involving Staff 1 and Youth B.\nI reviewed special investigation report #2025SIC0000382.\nVideo Reviewed:\nOn 04/30/2025 I reviewed with Program Manager agency video of\nthe time of the alleged incident involving Youth A. A review of the\nvideo did not identify any confrontations between Staff 1 and\nYouth A as alleged.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as Youth A denied the\nallegations were pertaining to him and only described the incident\nthat was already investigated involving Staff 1 and Youth B.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n05/01/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 5, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3"
