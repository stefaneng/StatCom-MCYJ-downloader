INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Discipline\nTitle\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10169\nSection (1) A facility shall have and follow written policy and procedure\nDescription which stipulates that residents shall not be subjected to any of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Corporal or cruel punishment.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was punched during an altercation with staff.\nInvestigation Face-to-face contact was made with Supervisor 1 on 04/05/2024\nat the facility during an announced visit. The area where the\nalleged incident occurred was viewed and documentation was\nprovided.\nThe Complainant was interviewed on 04/05/2024.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit on 04/05/2024. He stated\nhe had reviewed the video footage of the incident and had\ndebriefed it with both staff and youth in the resulting days.\nPolicies & procedures as well as video footage was provided for\nthis investigation.\nYouth A was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit on 04/05/2024. Youth A described\nthe incident in question as starting with him being on a phone call\nwith a family member and Staff 1 was supervising. Youth A stated\nhe got upset, but did not clarify specifically why, and he started\nbreaking things in the side office room where he had taken the\nphone call. Youth A stated staff asked him to go to his room and\nhe refused. Youth A recalled stating to staff that they “better let\nhim slit his wrists.” Youth A believed this was when staff members\nattempted to restrain him while he was still in that same side office\nroom. The staff members he recalled being involved were Staff\n1, Staff 2 and Staff 3. Youth A believed these staff members\npicked him up and they then left that side room to the common\narea of the unit. Youth A stated the staff members were about to\nput him in his room when he grabbed onto the hair of Staff 2 with\nboth hands and started pulling. Youth A recalled using a great\ndeal of force when doing this. Youth A remembered Staff 1\n2",
    "punching him in his side when this occurred. He also recalled one\nof the staff members attempted to peel back his hands from the\nhair of Staff 2 prior to him being punched. Youth A believed he\nhad his hands on the hair of Staff 2 for about five minutes. Youth\nA recalled letting go of her hair as he was near the entrance to his\nroom. Youth A stated he then attempted to pull the hair of Staff 1\nbut was unsuccessful. At this point Youth A then was inside of his\nroom and he tried to rush back out, only for staff members to stop\nhim. Youth A stated the staff were then able to close the door to\nhis room. Youth A believed no one else saw this incident because\nall of the youth were already in their rooms. He stated this was a\ncommon practice when he got very upset and fought staff.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit on 04/05/2024. He was not a\nwitness to the incident. He stated he has worked with Staff 1 for a\nlong time and has never had any concerns with his approach to\nthe youth, both in terms of verbal de-escalation or instances\nwhere physical intervention is necessary.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit on 04/05/2024. Staff 1 stated that\nhe was working with Youth A on the date in question, when Youth\nA began to escalate at the end of a phone call with a family\nmember. Staff 1 recalled being present with Staff 3 as Youth A\nescalated first verbally, then physically as he began to break items\nwithin the room where the phone call occurred. Staff 1 recalled\nthat Staff 2 received approval from management for them to\nattempt to restraint Youth A after he broke a vase. Staff 1\nexplained the history of Youth A’s attempts at self harm as the\nreasoning to attempt a restraint. Staff 1 stated the restraint\nattempt was difficult in the small space and Youth A fought back\nimmediately, resulting in he and Staff 3 attempting to remove\nYouth A from the room to a more open space in the common area\nof the unit. Staff 1 stated Staff 2 eventually became involved in\nthe restraint attempt and in doing so, Youth A grabbed on to Staff\n2’s hair and began pulling it forcefully. Staff 1 stated he attempted\nthe approved method of trying to pull Youth A’s fingers back to\nforce him to release Staff 2’s hair but this was not effective. Staff\n1 recalled hearing Staff 2 yell in pain. Staff 1 stated he then chose\nto punch Youth A in the side in an attempt to distract Youth A and\nhopefully get him to release Staff 2’s hair. Staff 1 stated this did\nnot have an effect either. Staff 1 stated he eventually was able to\nuse his own hands to get Youth A to release Staff 2’s hair. Staff 1\nconfirmed the physical nature of the incident ended when they\nwere able to have Youth A stay in his room. Staff 1 re-iterated\n3",
    "that he attempted the approved and trained maneuvers to try to\nget Youth A to release Staff 2’s hair and because of her reaction\nto Youth A, he made a split second decision to try something else\nand punch Youth A. Staff 1 also confirmed that punching is not a\nmethod that is approved for physical intervention by the facility.\nStaff 1 stated it was possible that they could have attempted to\ntransition the restraint to the ground in a safe and approved\nmanner, but that did not occur during the intense situation.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone on 05/30/2024. She\nrecalled that Youth A was acting “off” the evening of the incident\nbut Staff 2 made sure he got his phone call in with his mother.\nStaff 2 recalled Youth A getting upset at the end of the call and he\nbegan to wrap his shirt around his neck in a loose manner. Youth\nA also began speaking very aggressively to the staff nearby.\nYouth A then began to destroy property within the small office he\nwas in and then created an unsafe environment to the point that a\nrestraint attempt was warranted. Staff 1 and Staff 3 then\nattempted a standing restraint with Youth A and Staff 2 recalled\nthis quickly escalated to all three individuals moving out of the\nsmall room to the unit common area with Youth A struggling\nagainst the restraint. As the struggle continued, Staff 2 attempted\nto assist in the restraint, and this was when Youth A was able to\nget a hand free and grab Staff 2 by the hair. She recalled him\npulling on her head with force and it caused a great deal of pain.\nStaff 2 recalled his hand was able to be taken off of her head after\napproximately two minutes. Staff 2 could not recall exactly how\nStaff 1 and Staff 3 were trying to assist her in getting Youth A’s\nhand off of her head.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone on 06/04/2024. He\nrecalled Youth A participating in a family phone call on the night in\nquestion. Staff 3 remembered Youth A ended his phone call and\nthen began to escalate physically, including slamming a vase to\nthe ground and causing many sharp pieces to scatter. Staff 3\nrecalled initiating a restraint of Youth A with Staff 1. Staff 3\nbelieved that, because of Youth A’s struggling, they moved out of\nthe smaller room and into the common area of the unit. At some\npoint Staff 2 became involved and tried to help them and this was\nwhen Youth A got his hands on her hair. Staff 3 recalled\nwitnessing Staff 2’s hair be pulled aggressively, and he attempted\nto pull Youth A’s hands off of her hair. Staff 2 recalled attempting\nto pry Youth A’s thumbs back as they are trained to do. He could\nnot recall specifically how but did remember that Youth A\neventually let go of Staff 2’s hair in the process of being placed\n4",
    "inside of his room. Staff 2 did not recall seeing Staff 1 punch\nYouth A in the side.\nDuring a video call on 05/03/2024 DHHS Worker 1 stated that\nthere would not be a confirmed case as a result of his\ninvestigation.\nVideo Review:\nVideo footage of the incident from 04/01/2024 was reviewed on\n04/11/2024. The footage began at 7:50 pm on 04/01/2024. It\nshowed Youth A as he was in the smaller side room of the unit\nwhere phone calls occur. Youth A was seen already escalated,\nwith his shirt off and destroying property. Staff 1 and Staff 3\nattempted to perform a standing restraint and Youth A resisted,\ncausing all three to move forward toward the door to the small\nroom. The two staff are joined by Staff 2 as they attempt to\nremove Youth A from the room. The four individuals then moved\ninto the common area of the unit as there was a continued\nstruggle. At 7:50:35 pm it was seen that Youth A had both hands\non the hair of Staff 2. Staff 1 then struck Youth A in his left side\nwith his right fist one time. The video footage continued and\nshowed the continued struggle until Youth A was able to be\nplaced in his room at 7:51:55pm.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record\nand Staff 1 completed the required restraint model training\non 10/25/2023.\n• Facility policy titled “Emergency and Safety Management”\nwas provided and reviewed. In this policy a section titled\n“Restraints” outlined the practices of the facility when\nphysical management of a youth was deemed necessary.\nIt described factors requiring the hands on intervention with\nyouth that were consistent with the reasoning for the\nrestraint attempted with Youth A during the incident in\nquestion.\n• Training materials for the chosen approved restraint model,\nManagement of Aggressive Behavior (MOAB) were\nprovided and reviewed. It was noted there are no approved\nmethods of physical management that include striking a\nyouth.\n• Incident report dated 04/01/2024 was consistent with Youth\nA’s and Staff 1’s interview.\n• Documentation from the facility titled “Corrective Action\nPlan - Staff Incident” dated 04/19/2024 was provided and\nreviewed. In this documentation the Chief Administrator\n5",
    "discussed a review of the incident with Staff 1 and how\nfurther training and support could be offered to prevent the\nspecific action of striking Youth A from occurring in a similar\nincident in the future.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance due to Staff 1 striking\nYouth A during the incident, per video review and interviews.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n05/13/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n06/06/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n6"
