DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nGenesee County Juvenile Justice Center (GCJJC) is located in Flint Township,\nMichigan. The facility is a secure two-story building. The building is comprised of the\npersonnel and administrative offices; intake unit; medical unit; kitchen, two dining rooms\nand two gymnasiums. The residents’ records are kept in the administrative section of\nthe building in secure, locked files. An ample supply of desks, office furniture and other\noffice equipment exists to meet the staff’s needs. Emergency exits and equipment is\nalso visible in the building.\nThe residents are housed in the portion of building that consists of four resident wings\n(North, South, East, West). Three wings are in operational status, while the fourth wing\n2",
    "(South) is not currently in use to house youths. The East and West Wings are for male\nresidents and the North Wing services both male and females. Each wing has a group/\nTV/activity room, lockers and storage area for the youths, bathroom and shower area\nand staff outer area. The East wing has occupancy for 26 youths, West wing 26 youths\nand North wing 20 youths. All three resident wings have single and double occupancy\nrooms, with the majority of the rooms being single rooms. The facility has a secure area\nfor medication storage on each wing. The classrooms, which contains desks,\ncomputers, and an ample supply of equipment to meet the youth’s needs are between\nthe east and west wings on a separate corridor. There are also two large visitation\nrooms, each equipped with monitors, cameras, and seating to accommodate\nparent/child visitations. Both are capable of in person and virtual visits.\nThere is ample parking for staff and visitors; and the facility has a fenced in outside\nrecreational area.\nB. Program Description\nGenesee County Juvenile Justice Center (GCJJC) is a secure juvenile detention facility\noperated under the 7th Judicial Circuit Court. GCJJC’s purpose centers on supporting\njustice and public safety by providing short term programming for youths, court ordered\ninto juvenile detention, pending the court’s disposition of the youth’s case. The facility is\na 72-bed facility designed to provide short-term residential care to youths between the\nages of 10 to 17 years, who have been arrested for law violations. The youth is retained\nat the facility pending adjudication of his/her offenses. The youth can continue at\nGCJJC until a long-term treatment program, release to a parent/guardian, appropriate\nidentified continuum of care placement in the community, or escalation to a more\nrestrictive setting is court ordered/identified for the youth.\nGCJJC is transformed from the Genesee Valley Regional Center (GVRC) juvenile\ndetention facility, which found its start in 1957 when it became apparent that Genesee\nCounty needed to lodge youth in a more secure setting. With the increase in cost,\nGenesee County sold the facility to the State of Michigan for operation by the\nDepartment. In 2002, the State of Michigan turned the facility back over to Genesee\nCounty as an independent county ran Child Caring Institution (CCI). The center’s\ndirector was an appointed position of the Genesee County Board of Commissioners and\nanswered to the commissioners about operation and budgetary regulations. In the fall of\n2019, the Genesee County Commissioners voted that the operation and budget would\nbe turned over to the Genesee County 7th Judicial Circuit Court for management.\nGCJJC will provide youths placed in this facility with an initial health screening; medical\nexamination, educational services, and mental health and other professional services\nthat are contracted via various community resources. The Flushing School District\nservices GCJJC’s area of location, but the facility has contracted for educational\nservices from Mt. Morris School District. The school program is fully accredited and\ntaught by Special Education Certified teachers from the Mount Morris School District.\nThe teachers have experience working with delinquent youth.\n3",
    "GCJJC will use peer group support as a component of the behavior management\nprogram. Programming will also include daily recreation, daily group counseling, and\nindividual counseling, as needed. The staff utilizes Core Correctional Practices (CCP)\nand CHOICES, two cognitive-behavioral models developed by the University of\nCincinnati Corrections Institute (UCCI) that places heavy accent on skill building\nactivities to assist with a youth’s cognitive, social, emotional, and coping skill\ndevelopment.\nSingle occupant sleeping rooms are approved as behavior management rooms. Handle\nwith care is the discipline/Behavioral Management Modality utilized, which has\nemphasis on verbal escalation and role modeling.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThere are no rule violations.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nThe issuance of an original license for a court operated facility is recommended.\n3/26/2021\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 26, 2021\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
