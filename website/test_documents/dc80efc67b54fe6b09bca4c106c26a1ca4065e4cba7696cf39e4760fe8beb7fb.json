    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. The one special evaluation, 2025SEC0000220, documenting a finding of\ncorporal punishment was reviewed. The recommendation of a regular license\nupon completion of an approved CAP was appropriate based on the family's\nhistory and the recommendation of the other MDHHS worker involved.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe one CAP submitted by the agency during this review period was approved on\n4/19/2024 and was written in response to the 2024 licensing renewal inspection\nreport dated 3/26/2024. Of the four violations addressed through that CAP, three\nwere DHHS policy violations no longer regulated by DCWL. The remaining\nviolation was for licensing rule 400.12212(3)(a) related to timely employee\nperformance evaluation. The CAP was successful in achieving and maintaining\ncompliance with performance evaluation requirements evidenced by the violation\nnot be repeated during this year's inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator report was completed on 3/14/25 and identified areas in\nwhich the agency had barriers to maintaining compliance due an Interstate\nCompact case in which the other state's worker had poor communication.\nAdditionally, placement challenges and the local court increasing their assignment\nof juvenile justice cases added responsibilities to the case managers. Despite the\nchallenges, the chief administrator report indicated the agency was able to\nmaintain compliance well due to the effective implementation and oversight of the\nprior year's CAP.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed reported receiving supportive supervision\nthroughout the year during which there was a reduction in staffing due to allocation\nchanges. They reported utilizing tracking methods implemented after previous\ninspection CAPs which have been helpful with maintaining compliance. No\nconcerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe office appeared to have adequate space and equipment to provide for the\ndelivery of foster home certification, foster care, and independent living services.\nFiles are stored in a secured file area. The closed adoption files are stored in a\nlocked cabinet within a locked room.\n3",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMarch 24, 2025\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 24, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
