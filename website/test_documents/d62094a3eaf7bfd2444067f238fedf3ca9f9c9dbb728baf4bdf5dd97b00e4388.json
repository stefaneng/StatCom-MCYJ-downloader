INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nTitle qualifications\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 allegedly is involved in providing a phone with sexually\nexplicit material on it, to Youth A.\nInvestigation On 2/27/24, I spoke to Administrator pertaining to the\nallegations. Administrator reported they had found a phone in the\nfacility bathroom. This bathroom is used by the residents. The\nphone was in the ceiling tiles of the bathroom. They were unable\nto gain access to the contents of the phone therefore the phone\nwas provided to the police on 12/11/23. They discovered the\nowner of the phone on 12/11/23. Administrator reported she had a\nphone conversation with the police on 2/21/24 concerning the\nmaterial on the phone and filed a complaint on 2/23/24. It was\ndetermined the phone did belong to Staff 1 and the material was\nprovided by her to Youth A. The phone was being used by Staff 1\n2",
    "to communicate with Youth A. Administrator reported Staff 1 has\nalways been a good staff member, and this was surprising to find.\nAdministrator reported Youth A is not in the facility anymore but at\nthe Calhoun County Adult Jail for his previous convictions. Staff 1\nis no longer working at the facility. Her final date of employment\nwas 12/13/23. Staff 1 left due to other job opportunities.\nAdministrator provided the phone number of Staff 1 and\ndocumentation pertaining to the incident. On 8/28/24,\nAdministrator reported there were no other youth at the facility that\nwere “present” for the allegations.\nDue to the Calhoun County Sherrif Department’s involvement,\ncontacts were not allowed to be made with staff or youth until\npermission was given by the law enforcement department.\nContact was maintained by this consultant with Sherrif 1 from\nMarch 2024-July 2024 to receive updates on the case. On April\n16, 2024, Sherrif 1 reported attempts could be made to contact\nStaff 1. A contact was attempted on 4/30/2024 with Staff 1, but\nthe current number was no longer in service. I contacted\nAdministrator and she did not have any other ways to contact Staff\n1.\nOn 5/13/24, Sherrif 1 reported not to conduct any other attempts\nuntil the prosecuting attorney decided how to proceed.\nOn 7/15/24, Administrator reported there would be no pending\ncharges against Staff 1. An email from the prosecuting attorney’s\noffice was forwarded for review containing this information, which\npermitted consultant involvement. Administrator reported Youth A\nwas no longer at the Calhoun County Jail, and she did not have\nknowledge of his whereabouts or phone number.\nOn 7/15/24 and 8/30/24, I attempted to contact Youth A with the\nphone number on his initial intake form, but to no avail.\nDocument Review:\nThe following documents were received throughout the\ncourse of the investigation:\n• Incident Report: Incident report written by Administrator\nsummarized activities on 12/9/23 and 12/11/23. On\n12/9/23: Youth A was acting suspicious and taking 30\nminutes in the bathroom. A search of the bathroom was\ncompleted but nothing was found. On 12/11/23,\nmaintenance was requested to search the bathroom and\n3",
    "found an Apple iPhone in the ductwork of the ventilation\nsystem. Along with the phone were numerous green\ncoupons belonging to Youth A (positive reinforcement\ncoupons from the facility programming) as well as paper\ntowels. Marshall police department was contacted but they\nwere unable to open the phone. The sim card was taken\nout and the IT department was able to trace the number\nand determined it to be the number of Staff 1. The phone\nwas ziplocked and given to the Calhoun County Sheriff’s\nDepartment.\n• Personnel File of Staff 1: Staff 1 was hired on 11/22/21.\nAll training was up to date and compliant with licensing\nrules. All clearances were completed and up to date. Staff 1\ndid not have discipline in her file.\n• Calhoun County Sheriff’s Department Police report:\nCase Number 23-005024: Staff 1 was interviewed and\nreported she met with Youth A’s sister and brought a phone\nthat belonged to Youth A’s sister into the facility for the\npurpose of giving it to Youth A. Staff 1 reported she did give\nit to Youth A. Staff 1 reported she also was receiving emails\nand text messages from Youth A, although she reported\nshe didn’t know why she was receiving these emails and\ntexts. Staff 1 reported she was raped by Youth A five to six\ntimes in the facility. Staff 1 reported she did not report this\nto anyone because Youth A had threatened her life.\nStaff 1’s Facebook account was searched by the police. On\n10/17/23, she wrote to Youth A’s sister: “hey your bother\ntold me to get ahold of you…hey so I’m supposed to meet\nup and grab something for him?”. Staff 1 reported to police\nthis was to obtain the cell phone to give to Youth A.\nPhotos were reviewed from the phone that was found in the\nbathroom at the facility and Staff 1’s personal phone. These\nphotos were of Staff 1 and sexual in nature. They included\nStaff 1 inserting something into her vagina, masturbating,\nperforming fellatio on a white male subject, and modeling\nlingerie. These photos and videos were on Staff 1’s\npersonal phone and on the phone hidden in the facility.\nThe phone at the facility also revealed pictures of Youth A\nlaying on his back clothed with a cinder block wall behind\nhim. Youth A had videos of himself stating sexual\ncomments which were sent to Staff 1’s phone. Text\nmessages and snapchats from the hidden phone\n4",
    "concluded Youth A was using the phone to contact Staff 1\nand other people outside of the facility.\nThere were no threatening texts or videos from Youth A to\nStaff 1 on the phones.\nStaff 1 acknowledged in her interview with the police she\nhad obtained a marijuana vape and brought that device into\nthe facility, giving it to Youth A.\nVideo Review:\n• Video at the facility on 12/4/23 from 8:32pm-8:38pm, show\nStaff 1 and Youth A alone going into a stairwell together.\nThey were in the stairwell for approximately four minutes.\nAnalysis The agency is noncompliant with this rule. Staff 1 does not have\nthe ability to provide care and supervision to juveniles in a\ntreatment facility due to the following:\n• Staff 1 provided Youth A with a cell phone.\n• Staff 1 provided Youth A with marijuana.\n• Staff 1 sent sexually explicit photos and videos to Youth A\nfrom her personal phone to the hidden phone at the facility.\n• Staff 1 received photos and videos from Youth A.\n• Staff 1 contacted Youth A’s personal family in order to\nprovide contraband to Youth A.\n• Staff 1 admitted to entering into a stairwell with Youth A\nand video confirms she was alone with Youth A in the\nstairwell.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n8/30/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
