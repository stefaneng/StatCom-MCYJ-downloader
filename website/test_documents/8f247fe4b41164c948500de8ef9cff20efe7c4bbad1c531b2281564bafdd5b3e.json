Youth A stated he and Former Staff 1 acknowledged\neach other with a head nod and without conversation. Youth A\nstated he was in the community when Former Staff 1 found Youth\nA’s Instagram through his brother’s Instagram and reached out\nand he obtained her phone number. Youth A stated he did not\nknow when this occurred but guessed it was sometime in 2023\nand stated Former Staff 1 was no longer employed by Wayne\nCounty Juvenile Detention when she reached out. Youth A\nidentified Former Staff 1 by the first letter of her first name and her\nlast name. He stated not knowing her first name.\nFormer Staff 1 was hired at Wayne County Juvenile Detention on\n01/03/2023.

    "Youth A said he lied about Former Staff 1 giving her telephone\nnumber to him.\nTherapist at Youth A’s current placement was interviewed by\nphone on 01/03/2025. Therapist stated she redirected Youth A\nwhen he was not attentive in group. Therapist stated Youth A said\nhe knew Former Staff 1 and said, “I have her phone number.”\nHuman Resource 1 at Youth A’s current placement confirmed on\n01/16/2025 that a female person with the same last name as\nFormer Staff 1 was on at the facility for one day in 12/2024.\nHuman Resource 2 at Wayne County Juvenile Detention\nprovided Former Staff 1’s last known telephone number based on\nthe first letter of her first name and last name.\nDocumentation\nWayne County Juvenile Detention’s Code of Ethics policy and\nprocedure 3.1 (I) states “Staff shall not encourage, engage in or\nfraternize with any resident who received services by the Juvenile\nDetention Facility (JDF), while on or off duty. There will be no\nconduct whether on or off the job, that adversely affects the\nemployee’s ability to perform his/her current job or which\nadversely affects the institution’s ability to carry out its assigned\nmission. Staff will under no circumstances share personal\ninformation. Staff will under no circumstances take pictures or\nvideos of residents.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as there is not enough\ninformation to support a rule violation of Former Staff 1 reaching\nout and giving her telephone number to Youth A.\nCONSULTATION\nIt is recommended that staff review Wayne County Juvenile\nDetention’s Code of Ethics policy and procedure.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n3",
