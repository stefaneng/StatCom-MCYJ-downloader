    "A stated that this incident happened the morning of the interview. He\nstated that he was trying to go to the school so he could find one of his\nteachers, and Staff 1 followed him there. Youth A stated that Staff 1\nslammed a door to a classroom in his face, tripped him, and kicked him\nin his back after Youth A had tripped and fell down on his side. Youth A\nrecalled that Staff 2 came into the school hallway area at that point.\nYouth A remembered that he then ran into the training room, which is a\nseparate area of the building. He did not believe that Staff 2 saw him\nget tripped or kicked. Youth A stated that the kick felt like the tip of Staff\n1’s foot. Youth A stated that Staff 1 didn’t say anything other than “get\nup” when Youth A had tripped. He stated that he has not had any\nissues with Staff 1 in the past. However Youth A then stated he recalled\nthat Staff 1 pushed him while Youth A was still in the unit, and this\noccurred prior to the alleged, tripping and kicking. Youth A stated that\nhe was trying to leave the unit and pushed Staff 1 out of the way. Staff\n1 allegedly held out his hand to Youth A’s chest. Youth A recalled that\nStaff 1 asked him “Why are you trying to leave?” Youth A stated that\nhe understands that he is not allowed to just leave the unit anytime he\nwants to. He believes that no one else saw the alleged push, because\nthe other staff was attending to other youth. Youth A stated that he did\nnot wish to speak anymore about the incident.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 12/05/2022 with DHHS Worker 1 and law\nenforcement during an unannounced face-to-face visit at the facility.\nStaff 1 stated that he recalled the alleged incident occurring around\n7:15 AM that morning. Youth A came out of his unit as instructed to get\nan over-the-counter medication. As Youth A walked into the common\narea Staff 1 recalled that Youth A began to run around. Staff 1\nremembered Youth A kicking the training room door that was locked\nand then running into the school area. Staff 1 does not recall Youth A\nsaying much as he escalated, but he has had experience with Youth A\nescalating quickly and out of nowhere in the past. Staff 1 went into the\nclassroom area of the building, and Youth A ran out of a classroom\ndoorway and fell onto the floor. Staff 1 denied that Youth A tripped over\nhim. Staff 1 reported that another staff was present, Staff 2, who\nwould’ve witnessed this part of the incident. Staff 1 stated that he did\nnot trip, kick, or touch Youth A. Staff 1 recalled that Youth A had been\ntrying to get out of the unit much of the morning prior to this incident.\nOne tactic Staff 1recalled using in response to this was doing a “arm\ncheck.” This meant that he put his arm up to keep Youth A at arms\nlength away from him because Youth A can struggle with physical\nboundary issues. Staff 1 then continued to describe the incident. After\nYouth A fell to the floor, he got up and ran to the training room where\nanother staff, he was unsure of which staff, attempted to de-escalate\nhim. Staff 1 then reiterated that he did not kick or hit Youth A, and noted\nthat because of his large size and heavy boots, he would be concerned\n4",
    "about injuries to Youth A if something like that were to occur. Staff 1\nstated that he has seen Youth A escalate many times, but he has not\nhad issues or allegations like this come up in the past.\nYouth B, Youth C and Youth D were interviewed with DHHS Worker 1\non 12/14/2022 during an announced face-to-face visit. Each of them\nhas resided in a unit with Youth A, but none were witness to the\nincident in question. They each were able to remember some facet of\nYouth A being escalated the Monday morning of the alleged incident,\nbut none ever saw Youth A trip or Staff 1 put his hands on Youth A in\nanyway. All three youth stated that they have not had any issues with\nStaff 1 and spoke positively of him.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 12/14/2022 jointly with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit. Staff 2 recalled the morning of\nthe incident and remembered Youth A being escalated. He stated that\nYouth A is a “walker “and likes to walk out of the unit about once a day.\nStaff 2 recalled hearing Youth A yelling in the school area and he went\nthere to find out what’s going on. Staff 2 remembered Staff 1 being able\nto have line of sight of Youth A at that moment but was never within\narms reach of Youth A. Staff 2 recalled hearing Staff 1 ask Youth A\nwhat was wrong and hearing Youth A yell back to leave him alone. Staff\n2‘s recollection was that Staff 1 appropriately attempted to de-escalate\nand help figure out what was going on with Youth A. Staff 2 stated that\nhe heard Youth A state that Staff 1 had “messed with him” but then\nimmediately stated that this was not actually true. Youth A then stated\nsomething to the effect of being upset about another youth’s actions.\nStaff 2 recalled Youth A then walking toward the school area and both\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 followed. Staff 2 stated that he saw Youth A trying to\nbreak into one of the classrooms in the school and Staff 1 placed his\nhand on the door handle to not allow this. Staff 2 stated that, at this\npoint, Youth A fell back and claimed that Staff 1 hit him. Staff 2 stated\nthat he witnessed this entire part of the incident and stated that Staff 1\ndid not put his hands on Youth A at any point, nor did he kick or trip\nhim. As Youth A got up and ran to another area of the building, Staff 2\nstated that he told Staff 1 to stay back and allow him to attempt to\nfollow Youth A and de-escalate him. Staff 2 stated that he followed\nYouth A for another couple minutes and they eventually were able to sit\ndown in the training room and talk while Youth A de-escalated. At that\npoint Youth A continued to claim that Staff 1 hit him. Staff 2 stated that\nhe attempted to talk Youth A through what he witnessed of the incident,\nwhich included, no hitting, kicking, or tripping. Staff 2 stated that he has\nworked off and on with Staff 1 during his employment with the facility for\nthe last year and he has never seen a Staff 1 be verbally or physically\naggressive with any youth.\n4",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 12/14/2022 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit. He stated that he has had experience with\nYouth A on third shifts, because Youth A struggles with transitions and\nlikes to walk out of the unit and has trouble being held accountable. He\nstated that he was working the night shift of this incident and had not\nleft the building yet when this occurred. Staff 3 stated that he did not\nwitness the incident, but he also did not hear Youth A state anything\nabout it immediately afterwards before his shift ended. Staff 3 stated\nthat Staff 1 never mentioned the incident either in their time working\ntogether since then.\nSupervisor 1/Complainant was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on\n12/14/2022 during an announced face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nstated she arrived at the building in the immediate aftermath of the\nclassroom portion of this incident. Supervisor 1 recalled that Youth A\ntold her that Staff 1 blocked the door in a classroom and Staff 2 saw\nYouth A on the floor after Staff 1 allegedly kicked him. Supervisor 1\nthen stated that Youth A soon afterwards changed his story and stated\nthat Staff 2 would not have seen anything. Supervisor 1 confirmed that\nYouth A was provided medical attention that same day. The nurse did\nnot see any bruises in any form that would be consistent with being\nkicked in the back as Youth A initially described. Supervisor 1 stated\nthat her role as a program manager has allowed her to get to know staff\nstrengths and weakness as well, and she has not seen any concerning\nissues with Staff 1. Supervisor 1 stated that she has not seen him\nbecome verbally or physically aggressive with any youth.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed on 12/14/2022 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit. He recalled that Youth A had\ntalked to him on Tuesday 12/06/2022 for a normal therapy session and\nthis incident came up only briefly. Therapist 1 stated that Youth A did\nnot proactively bring up Staff 1 or the incident, but over the course of a\nfamily therapy session Youth A mentioned “that’s why I’m pressing\ncharges on Staff 1” and then “I’m not going to talk about it anymore.”\nTherapist 1 stated that he has had concerns in the past with Youth A’s\nrecollection of incidents, as well as Youth A struggling with emotional\nregulation and using things that are untrue as a tactic to deflect from\nwhat he could be actually working on.\nDuring a conference call on 01/04/2023 DHHS Worker 1 reported there\nwas no preponderance of evidence, and no staff members will have a\nconfirmed case.\nDocuments that were reviewed over the course of this\ninvestigation:\n4",
    "- Employee personnel file for Staff 1. Discipline was found over the\ncourse of Staff 1’s 16 years at the facility including: 26 instances of\nwrite ups for timeliness, 10 instances of not responding to escalated\nyouth properly, one improper restraint, and two incidences of personal\nconduct.\n- Incident report dated 12/05/2022. The incident report was consistent\nwith interviews conducted for the investigation.\n- Nursing note documentation for Youth A dated 12/05/2022. This\ndocumentation confirmed no injuries for Youth A.\n- Written statement gathered by the facility from Staff 1 dated\n12/05/2022. This statement was consistent with his interview.\n- Police report from Vassar Police Department dated 12/28/2022\nconfirming no charges were filed against Staff 1.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews of staff and youth at the facility as well\nas documentation review it was found that there was not sufficient\nevidence to show that there was a rule violation as a result of the\nalleged incident. It is inconclusive that Staff 1 hit or kicked Youth A\nbased on eyewitness accounts as well as medical attention provided\nafter the fact.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy.\nIt is recommended that the current license status be continued.\n01/13/2023\n___________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 17, 2023\n____________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
