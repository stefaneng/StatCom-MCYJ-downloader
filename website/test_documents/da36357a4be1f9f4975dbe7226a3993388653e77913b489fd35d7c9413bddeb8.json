INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff qualifications\nTitle\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 0 touches Youth N's breasts under her clothes every\nweekend and threatened to harm her if she told.\nInvestigation History:\nIt should be noted that on 6/26/23 DCWL received a similar\nallegation made by Youth N that Staff 0 touched her breasts, and\nthe matter was investigated in SIR 2023C0000563. At that time\nan incident report dated 6/23/23 indicated Youth N was in her\nroom alone and screamed for Staff 0 to “stop touching” her. Youth\nN was interviewed at Kids-Talk on 7/27/24. There was no staff\nnamed Staff 0 working at Vista Maria and no evidence any male\nstaff sexually abused her.\nPrior to receiving this allegation, I interviewed Youth N at the\nhospital on 2/1/24 concerning another allegation she made\nagainst Vista Maria staff that was not supported by the evidence.\nDuring that interview, Youth N did not mention a staff named Staff\n0 at Vista Maria had touched her sexually.\nI collaborated with Government Worker 1 who stated Government\nWorker 2 completed a well-being check on Youth N at hospital on\n2/13/24. Interviews pertaining to this sexual abuse allegation\nwere suspended pending a decision from law enforcement.\nAccording to Government Worker 1, there is still an open\ninvestigation alleging Youth N was abused prior to coming into\ncare. A Kids-Talk interview was scheduled on 2/27/24 to address\nboth allegations.\n2",
    "On 2/12/24 Government Worker 1 safety planned with the agency.\nIt was agreed that if or when Youth N was released from the\nhospital, any staff named Staff 0 would not be alone with youths,\nenter their rooms or have any contact with Youth N pending the\noutcome of the investigation.\nKids-Talk Interview:\nYouth N was interviewed by Forensic Interviewer (FI) at Kids-Talk\non 2/27/24 with me and Government Worker 1 observing from\nanother room via live video. The interview began at 10:05am and\nended at 10:59am. FI explained the ground rules, tested her\nunderstanding, and engaged in rapport-building with Youth N.\nYouth N said she had Kids-Talk interviews twice before and came\ninto care because her “stepdad was abusing” her and her siblings.\nYouth N shared her likes and dislikes, and admitted she often\nfeels self-conscious, overwhelmed, mistrustful and easily angered.\nShe said she “keeps to herself” at Vista Maria and feels safe\nthere. FI asked Youth N to provide more details about her stay at\nVista Maria.\nALLEGED INCIDENT 1\nYouth N stated in August 2023 in her room on midnight shift…No,\nduring change of shift around 7pm or 8pm, I felt like they were\ntouching me inappropriately. I tried to explain to staff how I felt.\nThey called a ‘clear (the area).’ I threw things. A male staff\nrestrained me. He was touching up here (pointing to her chest\narea) and down my thighs and stuff…I had pants on. He touched\nmy clothes.” Asked who restrained her, Youth N answered “Staff\n0 and Supervisor. They tried to grab me by my arms. Staff 1\nstood there. I fell. When I fall, they can’t restrain me. I told them\nto stop. Don’t touch me. Staff 0 picked me up from the floor like\nthis.” (Youth N demonstrated how Staff 0 slid his arms under her\narmpits while lifting her and his hands/arms came in contact with\nthe sides and undersides of her breasts). “He also touched,\nrubbed and pulled the top of my thigh to get me up.”\nALLEGED INCIDENT 2\nYouth N said a month ago when she was in her room self-harming\nwith screws, Staff 0 “touched” and “tried to touch her in the same\nplaces.” That time Staff 0 and Former Staff 2 were present and\n“kept grabbing my hands because I didn’t want to live anymore.”\n“I yelled and stuff…I was on the chair reaching for screws. He\npicked me up under my arms and grabbed my legs…He came\nfrom behind me and almost touched me. I kicked him in the\nstomach. Former Staff 2 was also trying to restrain me, but she\ncouldn’t.”\n3",
    "ALLEGED INCIDENT 3\nYouth N said a couple weeks ago, Staff 0 touched her\ninappropriately a third time. Youth N said she was in the\nbathroom breaking shower curtains when “he came in again and\ntouched me trying to restrain me.” Again, she demonstrated how\nStaff 0 came behind her and tried to lift her up and pushed her\nbreasts up from underneath. “I faced the wall, and he was on the\nside and back of me sort of pushing me against the wall. Staff 2\nwas there…They had me talking to a CPS worker then.”\nYouth N was asked to describe the physical characteristics of\nStaff 0. She said he is a tall thin white male in his 30s or 40s with\nblack hair in a “buzz cut.” She did not know him to go by any\nother names. “He worked there before I got there. I don’t like\nhim. He picks up dayshifts. I’ve seen him watch the kids and\nwrite it down every 15 minutes.”\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed Youth N’s Vista Maria psychiatric evaluation dated\n12/11/23 which diagnosed her with Post Traumatic Stress\nDisorder and Mood Dysregulation Disorder.\nI reviewed Youth N’s discharge paperwork from Kingswood\nHospital dated 2/15/24. She was diagnosed with Post Traumatic\nStress Disorder, Severe Episode of Major Depression without\nPsychotic Features and Borderline Personality Traits, along with a\nmaternal history of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\nI reviewed Youth N’s psychotropic medication list. She is currently\nprescribed Zoloft and Ability for mood, Vistaril for agitation and\nIntuniv for problems with attention.\nI reviewed two incident reports dated 9/6/23 and 1/26/24 that\nsomewhat resembled the events described Youth N in ALLEGED\nINCIDENT 1 and ALLEGED INCIDENT 2 above. There were no\nincident reports found matching the events or staff described in\nALLEGED INCIDENT 3.\nA total of five incident reports were reviewed since Youth N’s\nadmission to Vista Maria that suggest she experiences auditory\nand visual hallucinations, some involving a person named Staff 0.\nINCIDENT REPORT 1\nAn incident report spanning a 5-hour time period on 9/6/23\nindicated Youth N sat on the floor screaming “Staff 0 is back to get\n4",
    "her.” She told Former Staff 4 that Staff 0 was telling her to do bad\nthings to people again. Youth N attempted to pull an electrical\nplate off the wall. Former Staff 4 attempted to verbally deescalate,\nbut Youth N ignored her and started hitting the wall. A “clear” was\ncalled. Youth N appeared calm but minutes later, attempted to\nself-harm saying, “Staff 0 told her to do it.” Youth N picked up a\nchair, banged it on the wall and said she felt like hurting someone.\nShe asked to be taken to Children's Hospital. A nurse approved\nher prn medication. The psychiatrist was notified and placed\nYouth N on 100% observation status. At 9:15pm, Youth N\nentered her room and began banging on the wall screaming, \"Staff\n0 is back.” Youth N was given support and food and had no\nfurther issues that evening.\nINCIDENT REPORT 2\nAn incident report dated 1/26/24 indicated Youth N would not\nfollow staff directives, tore the key reader off the wall and\nattempted to remove the screws from the plug panels. Staff 5\nprevented her from removing the screws. Youth N yelled, \"Move\nbitch before I spit on you,\" walked to her room and tried to rip the\nelectric socket off the wall. Then Youth N went into the bathroom,\nthrew soap on the floor and attempted to remove the soap\ndispenser from the wall. Staff 3, Supervisor 1, Staff 5 and Staff 6\nresponded. Youth N left the bathroom and paced using profanity\nand refusing directives to go to her room. Youth N removed the\nwall plate and screw off the wall, put the screw in her mouth and\nswallowed it before staff could remove it from her hand. Manager\nand pediatrician were notified. Miralax was ordered and accepted\nby Youth N. Psychiatrist and therapist were notified. Youth N was\nplaced on 100% observation status for safety.\nSupervisor 1’s employee file contained no disciplinary write-ups.\nStaff 3’s employee file contained verbal and written warnings\n(6/12/23 and 7/24/23 respectively) for attendance and punctuality,\nand a final warning on 10/23/23 for his potential use of a cell\nphone around/with clients.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Complainant on 2/12/24. She said Youth N alleged\na male staff named Staff 0 at Vista Maria sexually abused her and\nshe had no additional information.\nI notified Youth N’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation, and\nshe expressed no additional licensing concerns.\n5",
    "I interviewed Rights Officer jointly with Government Worker 1 via\nTeams on 3/1/24. He indicated Youth N has had three psychiatric\nhospitalizations since she was placed at Vista Maria on 6/7/23.\nHer most recent inpatient stay was from 1/30/24 – 2/15/24 at\nKingswood Psychiatric Hospital.\nRights Officer identified Supervisor 2 was hired on 9/11/23 after\nYouth N made the first allegation addressed in August 2023, but\nbefore she made the second allegation addressed in this report.\nSupervisor 2 works midnight shift and makes nightly rounds to\nYouth N’s building (Freedom Center) but his office is not stationed\nthere. Supervisor 2 also responds to calls for assistance\nthroughout the campus. He was described as a 60-year-old bald\nAfrican American man, and does not fit the physical description of\nStaff 0 as described by Youth N.\nRights Officer said Staff 3 was hired on 3/20/23 and works\ndayshift in Freedom Center where Youth N resides. He is\ndescribed as a 33-year-old tall, thin African American man with\nlong dreadlocks, and does not fit the physical description of Staff 0\nas described by Youth N.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 via\nTeams on 3/6/24. His first name is consistent with the first name\nof Staff 0. However, his age and race do not fit the description of\nthe alleged perpetrator. Supervisor 2 is a midnight campus\nsupervisor hired on 9/11/23. He said he rounds the residential\nbuilding at night to monitor and support the staff but rarely\ninteracts with youths and does not go onto the sleeping wings. I\nasked if he is familiar with Youth N. Supervisor 2 said he would\nnot recognize her and has had no verbal or physical contact with\nher.\nINCIDENT REPORT 1\nI interviewed Former Staff 4 via phone on 3/21/24 who resigned\nover six months ago. She said she did not know a Staff 0 and\nnever saw any male staff sexually abuse or touch Youth N’s\nbreasts inappropriately while restraining her.\nINCIDENT REPORT 2\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 and\nRights Officer present on 3/4/24. He does not normally work in\nthe building where Youth N resides but has picked up extra shifts\nthere. Supervisor 1 vaguely recalled the incident documented on\n1/26/24. He said he was on the wing to provide support and never\n6",
    "physically restrained Youth N. He has heard Youth N hallucinates\nbut he has not seen it. Supervisor 1 said he does not know any\nstaff named Staff 0 and has never heard any male staff make\ninappropriate comments or use improper restraint techniques with\nYouth N.\nI interviewed Staff 3 jointly with Government Worker and Rights\nOfficer on 3/4/24. He has worked dayshift for seven months in\nYouth N’s residential building and has never worked the midnight\nshift. Staff 3’s surname and age are similar to Staff 0’s, but his\nrace is different from the description Youth N provided. Staff 3\nrecalled the incident documented on 1/26/24. He said he was\ncalled to the wing; Youth N had a chair in her hands and he and a\nstaff he did not know removed it from her. Staff 3 said he\nremained on the wing for 20 or 30 minutes and denied ever\nrestraining Youth N, saying anything sexual to her or ever being\nalone with her in her room.\nOn 2/8/24 Former Staff 2 was terminated for an unrelated matter\nand deemed unsuitable to work with children. I interviewed her\nvia phone on 3/22/24. Former Staff 2 denied being present for\nINCIDENT 2. She acknowledged that Youth N hears voices in her\nhead telling her to commit suicide but denied ever hearing the\nyouth mention a Staff 0. “I don’t even know a Staff 0,” she added.\nI interviewed Staff 5 via phone on 3/22/24. She said she does not\nknow Staff 0 but does knows Staff 3 who has a similar last name.\nStaff 5 recalled INCIDENT 2 and denied seeing Staff 3 sexually\nabuse Youth N, restrain her, or touch her breasts.\nI interviewed Staff 6 via phone on 3/22/24 with Rights Officer\npresent. She recalled INCIDENT 2 and said Staff 3 did not\nrestrain or touch Youth N inappropriately. Staff 6 said she is not\naware of a staff named Staff 0.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis Documents indicate Youth N has had multiple psychiatric\nhospitalizations and periodically experiences auditory and visual\nhallucinations that involve a reoccurring theme of being touched\ninappropriately by someone named Staff 0.\nThis is the second allegation made by Youth N with no evidence\nthat a male named Staff 0 sexually abused her. There are still no\nmale staff working at Vista Maria who fit Youth N’s physical\ndescription of Staff 0.\n7",
    "CONSULTATION\nI recommended Youth N be considered for a transfer to Vista\nMaria’s Rose Hall that provides more intensive psychiatric\ntreatment, if and when a bed becomes available.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMarch 22, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 22, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
