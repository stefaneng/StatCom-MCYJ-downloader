EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nIt encompassed three complaints for one foster home.\nThe incident related to a foster home complaint the agency received in late\nNovember 2022. The complaint alleged the foster mother and her spouse who had\nmoved into the home used spanking to discipline the five-year-old foster child.\nDuring the course of the investigation the evidence showed the foster mother’s\nspouse and the spouse’s children had moved into the home with the foster parent\nwithout the family composition change being reported to the agency. The foster\nchild, as well as other children in the home reported that the foster child and the\nadopted child in the home had been physically disciplined. Discipline took the form\nof spanking with a belt or paddle. During the initial phase of the investigation the\nagency developed a safety plan with the foster parent; and upon the interviews\nshowing evidence of physical discipline the foster child was replaced from the home\nand the investigation continued. After a lengthy investigation, the foster home was\nfound in violation of the behavior management rule, in addition to the reporting of\nfoster home changes rule, foster home applicant/licensee qualification rule, record\ncheck rule, foster home evaluation rule related to truthfulness; and the foster parent\nduties rule related to maintaining a copy of agency policies. Revocation of the\nfoster home’s license was recommended.\nThis foster home received two subsequent complaints against it, one in April 2023\nand another in July 2023. The allegations connected to or were a form of repeated",
    "allegations related to the investigation the agency was conducting. The foster home\nrefused to interact further with the agency on these complaints; and the agency\nsought the guidance of the Division of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL) on what to\ndo/how to precede related to these special evaluations. The agency affirmed its\nrecommendation related to these complaints.\nThe agency adhered to departmental rules related to the incidents and appeared to\nhave acted appropriately.\nThere were one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThis incident related to a foster home complaint alleging that the foster father hit the\nchild in the stomach and dragged the child on the carpet. During the investigation\nthe foster parents denied the allegations; but admitted that the foster father tapped\nthe child on the child’s bottom, while the child was clothed. The foster father\nreported this was the only thing that stopped the child from attacking the child’s\nfoster sister. The agency found the foster home in violation of the behavior\nmanagement policy. A corrective action plan was developed with the foster parents\nthat included training related to, Rearing Resilience: Strategies for Parenting\nChildren with Attachment Trauma; and Parenting the Positive Discipline Way.\nThe agency adhered to all departmental standards related to this incident, except\nR400.12327(7); and 722.120(3) for which the agency received a violation, as\nindicated earlier in this report.",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period. The first corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2022\nInterim inspection were it received the following rule violations:\n• R400.12413(1) (c)(ii) Medical and dental policy.\n• R400.12418(2)(a) Development of service plans\n• R400.12419(1)(c) Initial service plans.\n• R400.12510(2) Independent living contract.\n• R400.12607(4) Agency recommendation.\n• FOM 722-6B Family team meeting.\n• FOM 722-8 Case Service Plans-Overview, Types, And Time frames.\nSupervisor Approval.\n• FOM 722-8D Treatment plan.

The agency provided proof of\ntraining it indicated would occur. Showed samples of supervisor/worker biweekly\nsupervision showing continued discussions and focus with workers on adoption\nfamily assessment submissions to adoptive families, quarterly adoption progress\nreports, child adoption assessments and effort to move a child’s adoption plan\nforward. They also provided information showing reminders were given to staff on\nrequired foster care tasks and the case record reviews demonstrated the agency’s\nefforts towards correcting the violations.\nThe agency’s second corrective action plan related to Special Investigation\n2023C042000050. The complaint allegations were received on 2/24/2023. The\ncomplaint alleged that the agency was provided a safety alert in September 2022\nand not all of the issues were resolved. That the agency moved a youth based on\nsome unresolved issues, and additional issues, leaving five children in an unsafe\nhome. The special investigation found the agency in violation of R400.12404(4)(b)\nrelated to the physical, emotional, and educational needs of the child; that the\nchildren were left in a placement that was unsafe for several months.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan in April 2023, that\nindicated a safety protocol on R 400.12404 would be completed, along with a\ntraining for foster care department staff on placements, on all types of safety\nconcerns, and agency procedures. The agency completed this corrective action\nplan, proof of such was verified 8/18/2023.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency provided a chief administrator's report dated 9/5/2023. The report was\ncompleted per rule standards.",
    "Financial Overview\nThe agency provided a projected budget, and 9/30/2022 annual financial audit.\nThe financial information is as documented; no specific issues were noted.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to my engagement with the agency's chief administrator and five\nadministrative staff, I interviewed two foster care specialists, one licensing\nspecialist, one adoption specialist and two adoptive parents. The interviewees all\nreported positive remarks about the agency and services the agency provides and\npromotes.\nOther than an adoptive parent expressing concern about the amount of paperwork\ninvolved in the adoption process; a worker indicating a need for the agency to\ncontinue respecting the employees’ home life with respective to long work hours\nand trying to strike a balance; and another worker expressing a desire for the\nagency to provide finance support to employees around the wear and tear on\nworkers' vehicles, no other limitations or concerns were indicated.\nThree youth interviews were attempted; one was completed. The youth reported\npraise for her individual worker; and that she would recommend the agency’s\nindependent living program. She recommended that the agency work on being\nable to provide funds for more emergency type expenses that may surface for\nyouths.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nI conducted a tour of the agency's building, and no concerns or safety issues were\nobserved.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings, the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date October 12, 2023\nLicensing Consultant",
