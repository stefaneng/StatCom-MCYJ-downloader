    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection • (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nDescription suitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The worker reportedly kidnapped the child and sent threatening\nmessages to the parent after the worker was fired. The parent\nreported the worker for engaging in sexual activity with the child’s\nfather and reportedly the worker kidnapped the parent’s child\nbecause of it. No one will tell the parent where the child is.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nProgram Officer was interviewed by phone on 7/23/2024 and\nreported Parent A has other youths in care through a different\ncounty who are being case managed by that county’s local office.\nProgram Officer stated Youth A remained with Parent A after his\nbirth in April but was removed from her care on 7/2/2024 and\nplaced in foster care. Program Officer stated Youth A was placed\nwith Caregiver 1 who lived in the same apartment building as\nParent A. On 7/16/2024, Foster Care Worker 1 arrived at\nCaregiver 1’s home for a home visit and found Parent A alone with\nYouth A. Program Officer stated Parent A was ordered to have\nsupervised contact only and was not to be left alone with Youth A.\nCaregiver 1 returned to the home at which time she reported to\nFoster Care Worker 1 she was used as a babysitter, but Youth A\nactually lived with Parent A. Parent A told Foster Care Worker 1\nthe removal order was fraudulent, so she was allowed to have\nYouth A. Foster Care Worker 1 called MDHHS who advised her to\ncall the local police for assistance to remove Youth A from Parent\nA. When the police arrived, they would not assist and left because\nthe worker only had a virtual copy of the court order on her phone\nand not a physical copy. Parent A then left the apartment with\nYouth A who she placed on her lap in her car. An agency\nsupervisor brought a printed copy of the court order to Foster Care\nWorker 1 who then called the police a second time. The police\nbegan to look for Parent A and Youth A. Within 2 hours, Parent A\ncalled the police to report she was at Burger King with Youth A. At\napproximately 5:00pm, Program Officer met Foster Care Worker 1\nat the Burger King. Program Officer spoke to Parent A and\n2",
    "provided Parent A with the court order after which Parent A gave\nYouth A to Program Officer. Program Officer stated Parent A was\nvery calm and seemed to understand. Program Officer then\nbought Parent A dinner and explained that Youth A would be\nbrought to the hospital for an examination then would be placed in\na licensed foster home. Program Officer asked Parent A for\ninformation about any relatives who might provide care for Youth\nA at which time Parent A provided information for her aunt.\nProgram Officer reported the agency staff have been attempting to\ncontact that aunt but have not received any response.\nProgram Officer stated, since Youth A was removed from her\ncare, Parent A has been escalating, stating the removal court\norder is fraudulent because an MDHHS worker from the county\nwhere her other children are in foster care told her it was. Program\nOfficer reached out to that county’s’ MDHHS supervisor who had\nno knowledge of a worker telling Parent A the order was\nfraudulent. Program Officer stated Parent A sends at least 4\nemails a day to different people involved in Youth A’s case with\nallegations against agency staff and requesting to no longer work\nwith this agency. Program Officer stated Parent A’s services are\nvoluntary at this point and she has not been compliant and has not\nsigned any releases for the agency staff to obtain her medical or\nmental health records.\nProgram Officer stated there was a Team Decision Making (TDM)\nmeeting yesterday to discuss Youth A’s placement change during\nwhich Program Officer again told Parent A that Youth A was\nplaced in a licensed foster home, and he was doing well and being\nwell cared for. The TDM had to be ended early due to Parent A’s\nnot participating in the discussion, rather Parent A began accusing\nFoster Care Worker 1 of having a sexual relationship with Youth\nA’s father and stated she did not want to work with the agency.\nProgram Officer stated she had no reason to believe Foster Care\nWorker 1 had a sexual relationship with Youth A’s father. She\nstated Foster Care Worker 1 is no longer with the agency, but that\nhad nothing to do with Youth A’s case and was related to\nadministrative concerns.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed by phone on 7/24/2024\nand stated Youth A was removed from Parent A’s care and placed\nwith Caregiver 1 by MDHHS on 7/2/2023 after which the agency\nwas assigned the case on 7/3/2024. Foster Care Supervisor\nreiterated the events of 7/16/2024 as described by Program\nOfficer. She stated she was not present on the scene on\n7/16/2024, but she was on the phone with Foster Care Worker 1\n3",
    "and the police. She reported, after Parent A called the police to let\nthem know where she was with Youth A, Youth A was brought to\nurgent care for an exam then was placed in a licensed foster\nhome. Foster Care Supervisor reported Parent A is now denying\nshe was ever alone with Youth A and that she was “set up.”\nDuring yesterday’s TDM, she denied leaving her apartment with\nYouth A on her lap in her car. Foster Care Supervisor reported\nParent A had not yet been adjudicated for Youth A, and there is a\npending termination of parental rights petition for her other\nchildren, so she does not yet have a treatment plan through the\nagency.\nFoster Care Supervisor reported Parent A sends multiple emails a\nday with different allegations including that the removal court order\nis fraudulent because it does not have a raised seal. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated she has no idea where Parent A got the idea\nthat Foster Care Worker 1 was having a sexual relationship with\nYouth A’s father and Foster Care Worker has no reason to believe\nthat to be true. Foster Care Supervisor stated Foster Care Worker\n1 is no longer with the agency, but that was unrelated to Youth A’s\ncase and was based on documentation issues.\nFoster Care Supervisor reported Foster Care Worker 2 has been\nassigned to Youth A’s case for 5 days and has not had any\ncontact with Parent A other than during yesterday’s TDM;\ntherefore, she has no information about the allegations made by\nParent A.\nParent A was interviewed by phone on 7/24/2024. Parent A\nstated she was at Caregiver 1’s home on 7/16/2024 for a visit with\nYouth A and fell asleep. When she woke up, Caregiver 1 was not\nthere, so she was alone with Youth A. Parent A stated she called\nCaregiver 1 who told her Foster Care Worker 1 said she could\nleave Parent A alone with Youth A, which Parent A told her was\nnot true. Foster Care Worker 1 then arrived to take Youth A, but\nthe police told her she had to get off Parent A’s property.\nCaregiver 1 arrived home and saw the police, so she handed\nParent A the baby back and left again. Parent A stated she knew\nshe was not supposed to be alone with the baby, so she went to\nBurger King to be in a public place. Parent A called MDHHS then\n911 to surrender Youth A. When asked why she referred to the\nremoval as a kidnapping, Parent A stated the agency had no\njurisdiction. When asked why she believed Youth A is missing,\nshe stated no one will tell her where Youth A is placed. She stated\nshe knows she can’t know the name and location of the foster\nhome, but her aunt is trying to get ahold of the agency and hasn’t\n4",
    "received a response, so her family doesn’t know where Youth A is\neither.\nParent A stated, after Youth A was taken from her, Foster Care\nWorker 1 sent her threatening text messages which she will\nprovide. Parent A reported the agency will not respond to any of\nher emails. When informed emails between Parent A and the\nagency staff have been reviewed, she stated they might email her,\nbut her concerns about Youth A and Foster Care Worker 1 aren’t\naddressed. She stated the agency is retaliating against her for\nsaying Foster Care Worker 1 is having a sexual relationship with\nher child’s father. Parent A reported Foster Care Worker 1\nadmitted to having a sexual relationship with Youth A’s father,\nwhich Parent A recorded and will provide; however, she later sent\nan email indicating the recording had “autodeleted” so she no\nlonger has it. She stated she forwarded the recording to Foster\nCare Supervisor, but she never got a response. She stated she\ntold Foster Care Supervisor and Program Officer she wasn’t\ncomfortable working with Foster Care Worker 1, but they did not\nrespond. Parent A stated Foster Care Worker 1 made false\naccusations by writing her treatment plan that Parent A thinks\neveryone is out to get her.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nIncident Report - 7/17/2024 Child Placing Agency Incident\nReport (MDHHS-6082) completed by Foster Care Supervisor and\nProgram Officer document the following:\n• 12:00PM Foster Care Worker 1 arrived at Caregiver 1’s\nhome for a scheduled home visit, but she was not home\n• Foster Care Worker called Caregiver 1 who told her she\nhad left Youth A with Parent A, who lives next door to\nCaregiver 1\n• Parent A did not answer door or phone\n• Foster Care Worker 1 called the police for assistance\nremoving Youth A from Parent A\n• 1:00PM police arrived and got Parent A to open the door.\nFoster Care Worker observed her holding Youth A\n• Parent A stated the removal court order was fraudulent, so\nthe police stated it was a civil matter and left\n• Caregiver 1 admitted to Youth A living with Parent A and\nCaregiver 1 being utilized as a babysitter\n• 1:51PM an agency supervisor called the police to explain\nthe validity of the court order.
