    "(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing\na youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was physically abused by the agency on 4/28/25.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI left a voicemail for Complainant on 5/1/25 and 5/2/25. No return\ncontact was completed.\nThe following interviews were completed with DHHS Worker on\n5/8/25 at the facility:\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was in the kitchen on 4/28/25 in the\nmorning yelling at Staff 2. Youth A became verbally and physically\naggressive by flipping over tables. He also started arguing with\nanother peer in the kitchen, Youth B. Youth A attempted to fight\nYouth B. Staff 1 reported they redirected Youth A, but he refused and\nbegan kicking everyone. Staff 1 and Staff 2 separated the youth\nfrom each other by placing Youth A into a standing hold. As they\nseparated them, Staff 1 and Youth A tripped and Youth A fell to the\nground. Staff 1 reported Youth A did have a mark on his face due to\nfalling on his face. Staff 1 did not report a specific area on his face,\nonly that he did have a mark.\nStaff 2 reported she was in the kitchen on 4/28/25. Youth A began to\nargue with Youth B. Staff 2 reported she remembered Youth A\nflipping tables, and Staff 1 and Staff 2 escorted Youth A away. She\ncould not remember anything after that.\nYouth A reported on 4/28/25, Youth B was attempting to instigate\nhim, so he threw something at Youth B. Youth A reported an\nunknown female staff took him outside by holding his hands. Youth A\nreported he fell and then Staff 1 fell on him. Youth A did not report\nanyone physically abused him. Youth A reported when he fell he\nreceived the scratch on his forehead. Youth A reported no other\ninjuries.\nYouth B reported he gets along with Youth A. Youth B reported he\nhas never seen Youth A flip tables or fall. Youth B reported he has\nnever fought with Youth A. Youth B was unable to provide any more\ndetails of this specific situation.\nVideo Observation:\n2",
    "I watched video for the incident on 4/28/25. The time the incident\ntook place was from 7:48:00am-7:49:35am. Youth A was sitting at a\ntable in the kitchen and Youth B was at a separate table. Staff 2 was\nstanding opposite Youth A and they were engaged verbally. Youth A\nthen appears to swing his arm at Staff 2 while he is still seated. Staff\n2 is then seen swinging her arm around to hit Youth A (this was not\nto block Youth A’s arm). Staff 2 does not make contact. Staff 1\ncomes into the room and grabs Youth A to place him in a CPI\ntransport position and walks him out. As they leave the room, both\nfall to the floor. Staff 1 releases Youth A and Youth A gets up.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the incident report dated 4/28/25. It was written by\nStaff 1. The incident report did not note the restraint that\noccurred, only that Youth A was separated by staff.\n• I reviewed the Body Chart completed on 4/28/25. Youth A\nhad abrasion on his right side of his face. His face was\n“cleansed and antibiotic ointment applied…”\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. Staff 1 was hired on\n9/18/23. Staff 1’s central registry was last completed on\n4/12/24. Staff completed CPI refresher training and\nProfessional Communication and Conflict Resolution training\non 10/1/24.\n• I reviewed Staff 2’s file; central registry was last completed on\n3/14/25. CPI was last completed on 4/10/25.\n• Staff 2 did have discipline in her file. It was dated 3/14/23.\nStaff 2 was found in violation of work rule “Child Supervision\nand Treatment.” Staff 2 used profane language, threatening\nand yelling at a child.\n• I reviewed the agency’s behavior management policy. It does\nnot allow pushing, corporal punishment or physical abuse.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Video observation reveals that\nno one had physically abused Youth A. He was not pushed\npurposely into the floor. Both Staff 1 and Youth A fell to the floor\ntogether. Staff 1 and Youth A both reported they fell to the ground.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4160 Emergency restraint\nSection The use of emergency restraint as a lifesaving response for\nDescription a youth will be limited to:\n(b) When all other interventions in the agency's crisis\nprevention and intervention plan and the youth's individual\nsafety and calming plan have been utilized but fail to protect\nthe youth or others from unanticipated or severely\naggressive behavior that places the youth or others at\nserious threat of violence or injury if no immediate\nintervention occurs.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A was restrained outside of the parameters of the restraint\nrule. Additionally, Staff 2 swung her arm at Youth A to hit him but\ndid not make contact.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nThe following interviews were completed with DHHS Worker on\n5/8/25 at the facility:\nYouth A did not report that Staff 2 swung on him.\nStaff 1 did not report he restrained Youth A, only that he\nseparated Youth A from Youth B. Staff 1 did not report that Staff\n2 swung on Youth A.\nYouth B did not remember the situation.\nStaff 2 could not remember what happened during the incident.\nStaff 2 did not report she swung on Youth A.\nVideo Observation:\nI watched video for the incident on 4/28/25. The time the incident\ntook place was from 7:48:00am-7:49:35am. Youth A was sitting\nat a table in the kitchen and Youth B was at a separate table.\nStaff 1 was standing opposite Youth A and they were engaged\nverbally. Youth A then appears to swing his arm at Staff 1 while\nhe is still seated. Staff 1 is then seen swinging her arm around to\nhit Youth A (this was not to block Youth A’s arm). Staff 1 does\nnot make contact. Staff 2 comes into the room and grabs Youth\nA from his seated position and places him in a CPI transport\nposition and walks him out. This movement was not brief or\nhaptic touch.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the incident report dated 4/28/25. It was written\nby Staff 1. The incident report did not note the restraint\nthat occurred, only that Youth A was separated by staff.\n• I reviewed Youth A’s “Crisis Plan.” Staff are to use\npositive language towards Youth A, set firm expectations,\n4",
    "eliminate the conflict, and avoiding taking sides whether\nYouth A is the instigator or not.\n• I reviewed the agency’s Crisis Prevention Institution (CPI)\nPolicy. In the second and third stage of verbal escalation\ncontinuum, staff are to set limits, allow the youth to vent,\nand remove the other youth in the area. Staff are to be\nmindful and intentional concerning their nonverbal\nbehavior, allowing personal space and place themself in\nthe supportive stance. CPI transport: reaching under the\nyouth’s arm and grabbing your own wrist. Both staff would\nsecure the individual on both sides and transport the\nyouth. CPI transport positions are to be completed after a\nchild regains control of themselves from a team control\nposition. A team control position was not completed.\n• Staff 1 completed CPI refresher training and Professional\nCommunication and Conflict Resolution training on\n9/18/23. Staff 1 did not have discipline that was relevant\nto this investigation.\n• Staff 2 did have discipline in her file. It was dated 3/14/23.\nStaff 2 was found in violation of work rule “Child\nSupervision and Treatment.” Staff 2 used profane\nlanguage, threatening and yelling at a child.\nAnalysis The agency is in non-compliance with this rule.\n• Staff 1 used a CPI transport position to intervene with\nYouth A. Youth A was seated when Staff 1 used this\nintervention and was not a threat to self or others. This\nposition is used when youth are regaining control and\nafter a team control position.\n• Staff 2 swung her arm at Youth A, although not making\ncontact, this is not supportive stance or protective stance.\nCONSULTATION:\nThe agency “Crisis Plan” and Crisis Prevention Institute Policy\nare specific and well written. It may benefit the agency to review\nthese as a training to their staff either in individual supervision or\nin team meetings regularly. All staff are to know the details of the\nCrisis Plan and be able to walk through these interventions\nduring their shifts. It may also help the agency recognize those\nindividuals who need more training in this area.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4163 Health Status assessment; notification;\nSection debriefing; reporting.\nDescription (5)An agency will provide an incident report on a form\nprescribed by the department for each incident involving\n5",
    "the use of seclusion or restraint. The initial report shall be\nsubmitted to the department within 24 hours of the incident\noccurring. A final incident report shall be submitted no later\nthan 72 hours after the incident has occurred.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The agency did not complete an incident report for the restraint\nthat occurred with Youth A.\nInvestigation Video Observation:\nI watched video for the incident on 4/28/25. The time the incident\ntook place was from 7:48:00am-7:49:35am. The video shows\nStaff 2 comes into the room and grabs Youth A to place him in a\nCPI transport position and walks him out.\nDirector 1 reported on a video conference call on 5/29/25 there\nwas not an incident report completed for the restraint.\nAnalysis The agency in violation of this rule. There was not an incident\nreport written for the restraint.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n6/12/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M Decker Date\nChild Welfare Licensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 13, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
