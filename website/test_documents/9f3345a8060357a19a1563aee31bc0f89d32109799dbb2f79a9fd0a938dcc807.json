    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4111 Job description.\nAn institution shall provide a job description for each staff\nposition that identifies rules, required qualifications, and\nlines of authority.\nOne of three existing employee files reviewed contained a job description that was\nmore restrictive regarding therapist licensure, than what the facility actually required.\nThe existing employee that moved into a therapist position held a limited license,\nwhen the job description said full licensure required. The therapist is qualified to\nprovide the services, but the facility will need to adjust the wording in the job\ndescription as part of their CAP.\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the\nfollowing information prior to employment or at the time\nspecified in this rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of\nhuman services, the equivalent state or Canadian\nprovincial agency, or equivalent agency in the country\nwhere the person usually resides, that the person has not\nbeen determined to be a perpetrator of child abuse or child\nneglect. The documentation shall be completed not more\nthan 30 days prior to the start of employment and every 12\nmonths thereafter.\nOne of four new employee files reviewed contained a central registry clearance that\nwas done 43 days prior to hire, which is 13 days earlier than the rule allows.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that there\nare additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The\nfacility does not contract with, nor take DHHS youth.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHHS Contract/Policy violation. Please\nnote that there are additional DHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. The facility does not contract with, nor take DHHS youth.\n1",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nNo technical assistance was needed.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nConsultation was not requested.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care, no substantiated child\nabuse and/or neglect and no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during\nthis licensing period.\nThe facility has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during this\nlicensing period.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on their regular license.\nAugust 17, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 17, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n2"
