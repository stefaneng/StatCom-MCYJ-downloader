Youth A said her caseworker, whom she had never met,\nshowed up unannounced at the facility a week or so ago to meet\nwith her. Youth A said this upset her because she does not want a\nmale caseworker, did not know him, and did not know he was\ncoming. Youth A said after her meeting with him she was upset\nand did not want to go back to class. Youth A said the other youth\nwere still in school, so she decided to walk back to Ashmun\nhouse. Youth A said while walking back she changed her mind\nand decided to walk down the road. Youth A said Supervisor 1\nwalked up to her and told her to stop heading down the road and\ngo back to campus.

Staff 2 said she was driving on 170th avenue in her personal\nvehicle and saw Youth A walking towards US-10. Staff 2 said she\ncalled for assistance and started to talk with Youth A, asking her\nto turn around and go back to campus. Staff 2 said Youth A\nresponded saying “fuck you, I’m not going back” and continued to\nwalk down 170th avenue towards US-10. Staff 2 said she walked\nwith Youth A trying to encourage her to turn around. Staff 2 said\nStaff 1 arrived and talked with Youth A and Youth A told her to\n“get away”. Staff 2 said Supervisor 1 arrived and tried to ask her to\nturn around and go back to campus and Youth A refused and\ncontinued walking.

Supervisor 1 said the\nrestraint was done per technique and without excessive force.\nSupervisor 1 denied Youth A complaining of any pain during or\nafter the restraint.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth A’s MiSACWIS Incident Report 178940229 dated\nApril 2, 2024. The incident report is consistent with the staff\ninterviews.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with youth restraint. After\ninterviews with youth, staff and review of documentation, it is\ndetermined the restraint was consistent with Eagle Village\nrestraint model techniques.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Communication\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4124\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a written policy regarding\nDescription communication that ensures that a child is able to communicate\nwith family and friends in a manner appropriate to the child’s\nfunctioning and consistent with the child’s treatment plan and\nsecurity level.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was not allowed to make a phone call until she reported\nwhat was said in her private meeting with her caseworker.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was interviewed on April 9, 2024, and did not\nhave any further information.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on April\n15, 2024. Youth A said she was crying in her room after being\nrestrained and asked Supervisor 2 if she could call her former\nfoster mother. Youth A said Supervisor 2 said no, that she needed\nto process what was upsetting her with him or another staff first,\nand she told him she did not want to. Youth A said Supervisor 2\ntold her he can make her wait 24 hours for her phone call and that\nshe needed to talk about the private meeting with her case worker\nbefore she was allowed to make a phone call. Youth A said she\nthen asked Case Manager, who did not respond to her. Youth A\nsaid she asked Staff 3 who told her she needed to talk to\nSupervisor 2. Youth A said her former foster mother helps her\ncalm down when she is upset which was the reason she wanted\nto call and talk to her.\n4",
    "Supervisor 2 was unable to be interviewed due to being on\nmedical leave for an undetermined amount of time.\nCase Manager was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nApril 12, 2024. Case Manager said she was working on April 2,\n2024, when Youth A’s caseworker showed up unannounced to\nsee her. Case Manager said she had heard that Youth A was\nupset after the meeting and walked out to US-10. Case Manager\nsaid she was in Ashmun house when Youth A came back to the\nhouse and was upset. Case Manager said Youth A continued to\nwalk out of the house and go out of bounds for several hours.\nCase Manager said Youth A was escalated and asked to call her\nformer foster mother. Case Manager said Youth A’s former foster\nmother has not been helpful to calm Youth A down during phone\nconversations and there have been ongoing concerns about the\nconversations as Youth A will often report her former foster\nmother telling her she does not need to abide by Ashmun house\nrules. Case Manager said she told Youth A she needed to process\nwith her and calm down prior to making the phone call. Case\nManager said she had talked to Supervisor 2 and Clinical Director\nand the plan was once Youth A was able to calm down and talk\nwith a staff, she would be allowed to make a supervised phone\ncall to her former foster mother. Case Manager said Youth A\ncontinued to ask to call her former foster mother and was told\nseveral times she needed to take a breath, calm down, process\nwhat was going on, and then she could make the supervised\nphone call. Case Manager said Youth A never was able to calm\ndown while she was there in order to make the phone call. Case\nManager denied ever telling Youth A she needed to disclose the\nprivate conversation between her and her caseworker, rather told\nher she needed to talk about what was upsetting her and process\nher feelings. Case Manager said it is protocol not to allow a youth\nthat is highly agitated or escalated to make phone calls until they\nare able to show some regulation or de-escalation.\nClinical Director was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nApril 12, 2024. Clinical Director said she received a phone call\nfrom Case Manager on April 2, 2024, asking about Youth A\nmaking a phone call to her former foster mother. Clinical Director\nsaid she was told Youth A was dysregulated at the time and was\nwalking out of the house and out of bounds. Clinical Director said\nshe told Case Manager to wait until Youth A was regulated and\nable to talk with staff before allowing the phone call to former\nfoster mother. Clinical Director said she also gave the directive to\nhave the phone call with former foster mother supervised when it\n5",
    "was made due to the concerns that the former foster mother has\ntold Youth A, she does not need to follow Ashmun house rules\nand has not helped calm Youth A down in the past but rather\nescalate her further. Clinical Director said it is practice to have\nyouth be in a somewhat regulated state prior to allowing them to\nmake phone calls.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Eagle Village’s Youth Telephone Calls operating procedure\nwas reviewed. The procedure outlines the right for youth to\nmake telephone calls to individuals that are approved and\non their contact list. The procedure does not address the\nneed for youth to be regulated in order to make the phone\ncall.\n• Youth A’s contact list was reviewed, and the former foster\nmother is an approved contact on the list.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as the facility did not prohibit\nYouth A from making her phone call, rather set expectations for\nher to be able to de-escalate and show some stability prior to\nallowing the phone call. In addition, Supervisor 2 and Case\nManager did not require Youth A to share information from her\nprivate meeting with her case worker.\nTechnical Assistance\nTechnical assistance was offered to update the Youth Telephone\nCalls operating procedure to be consistent with what Case\nManager and Clinical Director indicated during interviews, that\nyouth to show stability prior to allowing the call unless otherwise\nnoted in treatment plan.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n_____________________________________April 26, 2024_\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 2, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
