    "summary": "An investigation found that at the Great Lakes Recovery Center for Youth, Youth A gave Youth C a hickey on the neck after both youths were in Youth C's bedroom, which was against facility rules. The incident occurred because Staff 1 left the youths unsupervised, violating the center's line-of-sight supervision policy. The facility is held responsible for the staff's failure to maintain proper supervision, resulting in a substantiated violation.",

  "sir_violation_level": {
    "level": "moderate",
    "justification": "The substantiated violation is a supervision failure. Staff 1 left youth unsupervised, violating the facility's line-of-sight supervision policy, which allowed youth to enter another youth's bedroom and engage in inappropriate physical contact (giving a hickey). This aligns with the 'Environmental or supervision failures' category for moderate SIRs, as it involves a breakdown in supervision that allowed a youth-on-youth incident to escalate."
