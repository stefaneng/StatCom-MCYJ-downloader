    "Investigation INTERVIEWS:\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via phone on\n1/11/24. CA reported he was not aware of the requirement for a\nplan review prior to remodeling or construction of the facility. CA\nreported Program Director did not provide him the information\nafter her being told by DCWL it needed to occur. CA reported\ninitially they did not believe it was going to be a whole house\nrenovation, so he believed that could have played a factor in the\nmiscommunication. CA reported he sent the information regarding\nthe requirement for a plan review to his Director of Maintenance\non 1/8/24.\nProgram Director could not be interviewed as she no longer\nworks at the facility.\nTimeline of Events:\n- 5/10/23: Received lab results via email from CA.\nContaminated areas of the facility were draped off so no\none could enter them.\n- 5/15/23: Phone meeting with Program Director, Consultant\nand Area Manager to discuss whole house renovations.\nArea Manager discussed plan review process with Program\nDirector on this call.\n- 8/7/23: Construction began at the facility.\nDOCUMENTS:\n- Email to CA on 1/8/24 to request the approved plan review.\nCA reported he missed the document request and\nrequested Director of Maintenance get it done immediately.\n- Email from Bureau of Fire Services Manager on 1/24/24\nstates “Repairs and maintenance of an existing\nstructure/structural components do not require a plan\nreview submittal. The repair/maintenance must be “like for\nlike” with the same materials and there are no additions,\nalterations, remodeling, or upgrades to the facility”.\nAnalysis The violation is not established as it was learned on 1/24/24 a\nplan review was not required for this specific project as the agency\nwas not altering any items on the home but just replacing the\nitems with the same item.\nTechnical Assistance:\nAlthough this was not a violation as it was determined the agency\nwas not remodeling but replacing the same items, that information\nwas not known during the initial report when DCWL reminded the\n2",
    "agency to refer to the plan review process. At that time, the\nagency was unaware if a plan review was required or not. Should\nthe agency encounter this again, they should inquire with the Fire\nBureau timely and not wait until 8 months to seek clarification on\nthe requirement.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nFebruary 7, 2024\nShannon Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 8, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3"
