Complainant was not present for the\nincident and received the information from Youth A.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 11/25/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth A stated she had been\nin several fights with peers lately. Youth A said she was acting out\nand causing a “clear” because she felt like it. A clear is when\nyouth are asked to leave the area, due to another youth’s unsafe\nbehavior. Youth A stated she was acting out on 11/24/24 when\nStaff 1 attempted to stop her.

Youth A\nrecalled that Staff 5 was present and probably heard everything.\nYouth A stated that she pulled Staff 1’s braids out. Staff 1 then\npulled Youth A’s braids out.

There were no scratches or fresh\nmarks; Youth A had some older, healed marks that did not match\nthe description from the allegation.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 11/25/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported she was not\npresent for the incident but saw Youth A with some of her braids\npulled out after the incident. Due to Youth A acting out that day,\nthere was a “clear” on the unit and the youth were moved off the\nwing. When they returned to the wing, Youth B saw Youth A’s pink\nbraids on the floor. Youth B overheard staff talking about Youth A\nfighting with another staff. Youth B could not recall which staff\nwere talking about it. Youth B stated she had never seen or heard\nStaff 1 yell, swear at, or put hands on any youth. However, Staff 1\ndid have favorites. Youth B did not observe any injuries to Youth\nA.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/2/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 stated that on 11/24/24\nYouth A was causing a “clear” for most of her shift. Youth A was\npulling signs and ceiling tiles down, kicking windows and doors,\npulling screws out of things, pulling the metal pieces off the ceiling\nthat hold the tiles. Youth A was redirected throughout the day and\nwould calm down at times to engage in an activity. However, she\nnever completely returned to baseline. Staff had to monitor her\nconstantly, even in the bathroom, as she would stand on the toilet,\nclimb on the stall, and pull the paper towel out. It was a long day\nfor everyone, constantly redirecting Youth A and trying to appease\nher, but keep everyone safe for the entire six-hour shift.\nAfter lunch, Youth A asked if a peer could braid her hair to help\nher feel better. Staff allowed that to happen. However, the girls\nbegan gossiping and Youth A became upset with another peer\nand wanted to fight her. Youth A began kicking the door to the\nother unit, in an attempt to get the peer. Staff 1 tried to talk and\njoke with Youth A to distract her. Youth A pulled Staff 1’s hair.\nStaff 1 told Youth A that was not a good idea. Staff 2 then came\non the unit. Staff 1 attempted to exit the unit, but Youth A charged\nat her. Staff 4 and Staff 5 tried to stop Youth A, but she was able\nto get away and grab Staff 1’s hair.

Staff 1\nstated Youth A had pulled her braids out at her scalp. Staff 1\n3",
    "decided to file charges against Youth A and law enforcement was\ncalled.\nStaff 1 was informed the video had been reviewed and it was\nobserved she was standing very close to Youth A’s face prior to\nanything happening. Staff 1 sated she was “playing with (Youth\nA)”. Staff 1 stated she did that throughout the day, joking, and\ntrying to redirect Youth A. When asked if she could see that\naction could be viewed as threatening, Staff 1 answered, “I\nguess”. Staff 1 denied saying anything about Youth A’s parents.\nStaff 1 said that Youth A told her she resembled her father’s\ngirlfriend. That was why Youth A’s parents came up, not because\nof anything Staff 1 said. When asked why Staff 1 was observed on\nvideo to be “twerking” in front of everyone, Staff 1 stated she was\njust dancing and joking, laughing with the kids as she always did.\nStaff 1 denied pulling Youth A’s hair at any time and stated if her\nhair was pulled it was due to being entangled in Staff 1’s necklace.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/2/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 stated the unit was in a\n“clear” when she arrived on shift. Staff 2 put her things away and\nwent to assist Staff 1 and Staff 5, as they were blocking Youth A\nfrom removing screws from the bottom of a door. Youth A then\ngrabbed Staff 1 by the braids in her hair. Staff 1 grabbed Youth\nA’s hands, trying to release her hair. Staff 2 and Staff 5 attempted\nto assist, so they were all standing in a group. Staff 2 told Staff 1\nto “tap out” and leave the unit. They were able to separate Staff 1\nand Youth A for a moment. Then as Staff 1 was leaving the unit,\nYouth A ran up and tried to hit Staff 1. Staff 4 and Staff 5\nattempted to restrain Youth A. Youth A was observed to have\nsome of Staff 1’s braids in her hand. Staff 1 also had braids in her\nhand, which Staff 2 believed belonged to Staff 1, not Youth A.\nStaff 1 was looking for a necklace that had broken and fallen off.\nHowever, she was encouraged to leave the unit to diffuse the\nsituation.\nYouth A was removed from the facility by law enforcement and\ntaken to the hospital. When Youth A returned, she had some\nmarks on her wrists. However, it was unknown if it was from this\nincident, from handcuffs, from the hospital, or from the several\nother incidents Youth A had been involved in during the week.\nYouth A told Staff 2 that Staff 1 said she was going to have sex\nwith Youth A’s dad. Staff 2 did not hear Staff 1 say that, or\nanything else inappropriate.\n4",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/2/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 arrived on the unit and\nsaw Staff 5 with Youth A in the corner. Youth A had just pulled\nStaff 1’s hair. Staff 3 assisted in keeping Youth A and Staff 1\nseparated. Staff 1 was talking to Youth A, attempting to\ndeescalate her. However, Youth A became aggressive and said,\n“we can fight right now”. Staff 1 was directed to go to the office. As\nStaff 1 was walking to the door, Youth A ran and grabbed Staff 1’s\nhair again Staff 3 tried to get the hair out of Youth A’s hands. Staff\n2 and Staff 5 were also attempting to assist. Staff 3 and Staff 5\nattempted to restrain Youth A, but she dropped to the floor, so\nthey released her. Youth A’s braids were caught in Staff 1’s\nnecklace and pulled out when she dropped to the floor. Staff 1’s\nnecklace also broke and fell to the floor. Staff 3 did not see Staff 1\ngrab Youth A’s hair or hit her at any time. Staff 3 did not recall\nhearing Staff 1 say anything inappropriate. Staff 3 stated she\nbelieved Staff 1 handled the situation appropriately from what she\nsaw. No marks or injuries were observed on Youth A.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/2/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 stated she was the\nassigned one to one worker for Youth A that day. Youth A seemed\nhappy at the start of the shift around 9:00AM, but then her attitude\nchanged after lunch. Youth A was standing around as if she were\nwaiting for something. Then Youth A began acting out and said\nshe wanted to cause a “clear”. Youth A continued her behaviors,\nputting the unit in a “clear” off and on for several hours. Youth A\nstated she wanted to cause damage. Youth A climbed on\nfurniture, hit the television, tried to grab cords in the ceiling, and\nthrew things. Staff verbally redirected and attempted to engage\nYouth A in activities that she enjoyed. Around 3:00 Youth A went\nto the front door and tried pulling screws out of the bottom of the\ndoor kick plate, stating she planned to swallow them so she could\ngo to the hospital. Staff 4 blocked Youth A from taking the screws\nout, so Youth A began kicking the door. Youth A was verbally\nredirected and blocked from the door by Staff 4 and Staff 5. Youth\nA then pulled Staff 5’s hair. Staff 1 stepped in and got very close,\nalmost nose to nose, with Youth A. Youth A said, “you trying to\nkiss me?” Staff 1 replied with something about pulling braids. They\nwent back and forth verbally for a moment. Then Youth A hit Staff\n1. Staff 4 and Staff 5 tried to put Youth A in a restraint, but she\ndropped to the floor. Youth A got up and ran after Staff 1. Youth A\ngrabbed Staff 1’s hair. Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 4 tried to release\nYouth A’s hand from Staff 1’s hair. Once Youth A let go, Staff 1\nleft the unit.\n5",
    "Staff 4 stated that Staff 1’s initial response to Youth A was wrong\nand likely escalated the youth. Youth A is known for wanting to\ncause problems and attacking staff frequently. Staff 4 stated that\nStaff 1’s attitude likely contributed to Youth A’s behavior. Staff 1\nwas not always appropriate with youth and said things at times\nthat she should not have. Staff 4 did not hear the comment about\nYouth A’s parents. However, Staff 4 felt that Staff 1 had boundary\nissues and spoke very casually with youth as if they were friends.\nStaff 4 noted that after things calmed down and she wrote an\nincident report, Staff 1 insisted on reading it. Staff 1 stated she\nthought the comment about Youth A’s braids was deescalating.\nStaff 4 explained that it was not. Staff 1 asked Staff 4 to take that\npart out of the incident report. Staff 4 did not change the report.\nDuring the interview Rights Officer clarified for Staff 4 that she is\nnot required to show her incident report to any staff.\nStaff 4 did not observe any injuries to Youth A after the altercation.\nStaff 1 had pulled some of Youth A’s braids out, so Staff 4 helped\nYouth A take the rest of her hair down after she returned from the\nhospital that evening.\nMDHHS Worker contacted DCWL via telephone on 12/5/24 and\nreported that contact occurred with Police Officer. Police Officer\nreported that while at the facility on 11/24/24, Staff 1 was verbally\nprovoking Youth A. Staff 1 was encouraged to leave the area but\ncontinued making comments toward Youth A to agitate her. Police\nOfficer then removed Youth A from the facility and took her to the\nhospital. Charges against Youth A were later dropped.\nOn 12/13/24 a second intake came in, indicating a youth had their\nhair pulled by Staff 1, “two weeks ago” and Staff 1 was fired but\nthe incident was not reported. Only the first name of a youth was\nprovided. Due to the date aligning with the original allegation and\nthe information being similar, Rights Officer was contacted to\nverify the youth in the second allegation. Rights Officer reported\nthey did not, nor had they recently, had a youth by that name. As\nthe allegation came from a youth at another facility that heard the\ninformation second hand, it was determined the second intake\nwas not a new allegation, and was likely regarding Youth A.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/18/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 5 stated he was present\nfor most of the incident. However, he was not sure exactly how it\nstarted. Staff 5, Staff 4 and Staff 1 were trying to keep Youth A\nfrom taking a door apart.

Staff 3 and Staff 5 tried to place Youth A\nin a standing hold. Staff 5 stated he was so focused on the hold\nthat he was not paying attention to what Youth A and Staff 1 were\ndoing with their hands or hair or who was saying what. Staff 5\nstated there have been so many incidents with Youth A, it was\nhard to separate them and recall what happened and when. Staff\n5 was unsure if Staff 1 did or said anything inappropriate. Staff 5\ndid not recall seeing any injuries on Youth A. However, Staff 5\nremembered seeing that some of Youth A’s hair had been pulled\nout.\nFoster Care Worker contacted DCWL via video call on 12/20/24\nand reported she visited Youth A that morning. The ongoing\nbehavior issues were discussed as well as ways to manage her\nemotions. Youth A was calm during the visit, as she was the only\nperson on the unit and had staff to herself. Youth A continued to\nreport being bored when alone on the unit. However, her behavior\nwhen at school or with other youth had continuously been unsafe.\nStaff kept Youth A occupied with drawing, coloring, crafts, and\ndecorating the building for the holidays.\nVideo Reviewed:\nYouth A was sitting in a chair with Staff 4. Youth A then got up and\nwalked toward the wall, began pulling wires out of an outlet cover.\nStaff 4 redirected. Youth A then stood on the couch, tried to pull\ndown ceiling tiles.

At one point Staff 1 grabbed both of\nYouth A’s arms and raised them up over her head, then dropped\nthem and stepped back. Staff 5 stepped closer to Youth A, while\nStaff 1 stepped to the side and twerked/danced. Staff 1 then\nwalked away. Youth A grabbed some of Staff 5’s long braids then\nreleased them. Staff 5 continued using his body to block the door.\nYouth A walked away toward another door. Staff 1, Staff 3, Staff 4,\nand Staff 5, were in close proximity.
