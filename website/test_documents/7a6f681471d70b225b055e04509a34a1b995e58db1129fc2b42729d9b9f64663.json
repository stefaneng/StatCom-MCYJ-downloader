Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nFacility has not submitted records to MDHHS for permanent retention one year\nfollowing the final order of adoption as required.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/20/2022 I was assigned to investigate allegations submitted by Complainant\nthrough the DCWL on-line compliant form. Complainant stated that 53 closed\nadoption files were identified for which the licensee has not submitted the finalized\nadoption files to MDHHS for permanent retention one year following the finalization\norder.\nOn 5/24/2022 I requested a list of the 53 case names from the complainant, which I\nreceived through email the same day. Additionally, I asked the complainant to verify\nif all 53 files were associated with the LAS-Troy license, to which she responded that\nshe did not know to which license each file was attached; therefore, all 53 files are\naddressed within this report.\nINTERVIEWS\nOn 6/24/22 I held a virtual meeting with Chief Administrator, Program Manager 1,\nand Program Manager 2.\nChief Administrator 1 reported Lutheran Adoption Services is currently undergoing\nan effort statewide to develop a uniform procedure for tracking and distributing\nfinalized adoption files in order to achieve and maintain compliance in each office.\nChief Administrator 1 reported compliance has been a challenge due to Lutheran\n2",
    "Adoption Services having offices throughout the state of Michigan and the tight\ntimeframe of bringing files to local offices between the 12-13th month following\nfinalization can present challenges if the office who provided the adoption service is\nlocated several hours from the county DHHS where the file must be brought.\nProgram Manager 1, who works under the LAS-Lansing license, reported that she\ncompiled information about the 53 cases named by the complainant. She stated that\nsome of the files were not located in the agency database, so it is believed these\nwere identified as being Lutheran Adoption Services cases in error. Program\nManager 1 stated she was able to identify to which office each of the applicable files\nbelonged and where those files were in the process of being returned to the local\noffices.\nProgram Manager 2, who works under the license named in this investigation, LAS-\nTroy, reported that her team is working to distribute overdue finalized case files to\nthe appropriate local office. Program Manager 2 also reported that Wayne County in\nparticular has been difficult to work with regarding the delivery of closed adoption\nfiles due to not having the storage space for the files.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nOn 6/1/2022 I received and reviewed an email from Consultant 2 in which she\ndocumented her on-site visit to the Troy office that morning. Consultant 2 reviewed\nthe finalized adoption file storage and met with Program Manager 2, who told\nConsultant 2 that the staff member who was responsible for tracking the finalized\nadoption files left the agency a few weeks ago and that all staff are now working\ncollectively to add required documentation to files for distribution to the applicable\nlocal DHHS office.\nOn 6/10/2022 I received and reviewed a spreadsheet from Program Manager 1\nidentifying the following information about each of the 53 cases named in the\ncomplaint regarding to which license they belong as well as their current location\nstatus:\n1. Youth A – Lansing License\n2. Youth B – The agency did not have the youth’s case, only the adoptive family\n3. Youth C – Lansing License\n4. Youth D – Not located in the LAS database\n5.

    "managed under the LAS-Troy license. Of those 23, 16 were not delivered to the\napplicable local office within the required timeframe.\nOn 6/21/2022 I completed a review of the files of Youth’s D and AAA in MiSACWIS\nand determined that neither case was managed by either of the Lutheran Adoption\nServices licenses.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nADM 1030 Disposition of Records for MDHHS Supervised Children\nFor both MDHHS and contracted adoption agency cases, the\nlocal MDHHS office or contracted agency must retain all\nadoption case records for one year after finalization of the\nadoption. One year (between 12-13 months) past the adoption\nfinalization date, a contracted adoption agency must send the\noriginal record to the local MDHHS office; copies must not be\nmaintained by the contracted adoption agency; see licensing\nrule R400.12713-Adoption Placement Record.\nANALYSIS: The licensee is in violation as 16 files were not sent to the local\nMDHHS office between 12-13 months of finalization.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\nJune 27, 2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5",
