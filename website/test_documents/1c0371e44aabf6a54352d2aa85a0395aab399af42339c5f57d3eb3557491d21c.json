The facility reported\nthey did not provide Youth A with any items such as DVDs, CDs,\nbroke pens or broken plexiglass as if those items were found it\nwould have been thrown out. It is believed the facility did not\nprovide these items and the items could have been already within\nthe home or from Youth A hiding them from the facility and foster\n7",
