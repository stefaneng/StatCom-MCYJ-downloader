    "ALLEGATION: Agency included/identified reporting source in their report. This\ninformation is confidential.\nINVESTIGATION:\nIt was reported that Staff 1 of this agency completed a special evaluation report that\nincluded the identification of the referral source that initiated the special evaluation of a\nfoster home and Supervisor 1 of this agency reviewed and signed/approved the special\nevaluation report.\nA copy of the foster home special evaluation report was received and reviewed. The\nallegation section of the report appeared to be a copy of an email that was received\nfrom the referral source indicating the allegations/basis for the complaint. This email\nwas lengthy and appeared to be unedited to the extent that the referral source was\nreadily identifiable.\nI interviewed State Worker 1 by telephone on 0924/2021. State Worker 1 stated the\nexpectations of how confidentiality is handled has changed over time with the most\nrecent changes occurring in Act 116 in March of 2018. State Worker 1 stated she did\nnot know when Staff 1 and Supervisor 1 may have attended the special evaluation\ntraining provided by the state, but any possible noncompliance may be a training issue\nrelated to the changes and current expectations associated with confidentiality.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 and Supervisor 1 by telephone on 09/29/2021. Supervisor\n1 stated she was unsure of when she had previously attended the special evaluation\ntraining, but her most recent participation was in 2013. Supervisor 1 stated this was an\nissue that the staff has had difficulty with in how to provide a comprehensive\npresentation of allegations that may be received without identifying the referral source of\nthe allegations. Supervisor 1 stated she would forward her related training information\nand the training information for Staff 1 to me as a part of this investigation.\nThe training information was received from Supervisor 1 on 09/29/2021. This\ninformation indicated Supervisor 1 last attended the foster home complaint training\nprovided by the state on October 30, 2013, and Staff 1 attended certification and\ncomplaint training in January 2018.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nAct 116 Person making report, cooperating in investigation, or\n722.115l (2) assisting in other requirement; immunity from liability;\nconfidentiality; anonymous complaint; false report.\nExcept as provided in section 10(3), the identity of a person\nmaking a report and cooperating with or assisting the\ndepartment relative to that report under this act is\n3",
    "confidential, subject only to disclosure with the consent of\nthat person or by judicial process.\nANALYSIS: The findings of this investigation determined the agency staff did\ncomplete/approve a foster home evaluation that included\ninformation that identified the referral source for the complaint in\nviolation of the need to maintain the confidentiality of this\ninformation.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe findings also indicated Staff 1 and Supervisor 1 attended\ntraining related to this issue prior to the effective date of the\ncurrent expectations related to confidentiality. It is\nrecommended that the facility have licensing workers and\nsupervisors attend certification and complaint training again\ngiven it has been 8 years since they attended and CPA rules\nand Act 116 have been amended since then.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend with the submission and acceptance of an approved corrective action\nplan the current license status of this child placing agency-private be maintained.\n09/29/2021\n________________________________________\nMark R.
