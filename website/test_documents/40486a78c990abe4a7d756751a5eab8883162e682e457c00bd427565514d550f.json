    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A youth feels unsafe at the facility because a staff member is\nbullying him. The staff member has stuck their tongue out,\nlaughed at the youth, and looked at the youth in a bad way.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/7/25.\nYouth A reported the first time he met Staff 1, they were sitting at\na table and Staff 1 said, “Why are you looking at me? What are\nyou looking at?”. Youth A replied, “How do you know I’m looking at\nyou?”. Youth A reported it happened a long time ago, and he\ndoesn’t remember who else was present, but the interaction\npushed him to be guarded against Staff 1. Youth A reported a\nseparate time, Staff 1 was leaving and stuck her tongue out at him\nlike she was mocking him. Youth A couldn’t remember if anyone\nelse was around. Youth A reported another time, there were three\nstaff present (Staff 1, Staff 5 and another staff he couldn’t\nremember). Youth A reported he told Staff 5 he didn’t get along\nwith Staff 1 and he didn’t want her present, so she should go be\nwith the other youth instead. Youth A reported Staff 1 said, “I’m\ngoing to be here whether you like it or not”. Another time, Youth A\nreported he didn’t want to interact with Staff 1, and they weren’t\ngetting along at all. Youth A did not provide any other details.\nYouth A reported there have been multiple situations, and he\nwants to avoid any reports so he doesn’t get in trouble, so he\nwanted to report this information before anything more could\nhappen. Youth A reported he feels like Staff 1 is provoking him, so\nthey keep butting heads with each other. Youth A reported he\nwould rather not be around her, so he can protect himself and\nstop her from provoking him. Youth A reported no matter how\nmuch he tries to stay away from her, she continues to try and be\naround him to push his buttons. Youth A reported when Staff 1 is\naround him, she says, “whether you want me around or not, I have\nto be here”, so it’s clear Staff 1 doesn’t care what he thinks or how\nhe feels. Youth A reported Staff 1’s body language presents as\nshe is demeaning towards him. Youth A reported Staff 1 has\nnever insulted him with her words; it’s just her body language and\n2",
    "being around him when he has stated repeatedly, he doesn’t want\nher around. Youth A reported he feels Staff 1 lacks respect\ntowards him and it’s causing problems for him he didn’t choose to\nhave. Youth A reported there haven’t been staff around to witness\nall these situations, but all staff are aware he doesn’t want Staff 1\naround him. Youth A reported he doesn’t want Staff 1 to get in\ntrouble, but he wants to set boundaries and wants to make sure\nshe doesn’t continue interacting with him in this way.\nYouth B was unable to be interviewed. Youth B was discharged\nfrom the facility in December 2024 and was discharged from the\nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) as well, due to turning 18\nyears old. The facility does not have any contact information for\nYouth B or his current case manager.\nAssistant Director (AD) was interviewed via phone on 2/4/25.\nAD reported she did not have any information besides what was\nlisted in the allegations.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/7/25. Supervisor reported there have been no concerns\nregarding Staff 1’s interactions with Youth A in any of her\nperformance reviews and Staff 1 has not had any disciplinary\nactions or corrections related to her interactions with youth.\nSupervisor reported there has been tension between Youth A and\nStaff 1 for a while, but she’s not sure why the tension originated.\nSupervisor reported the tension originated around September\n2024, but Supervisor was on leave during that time, so she\nlearned about the tension when she returned.\nSupervisor reported there was tension between Staff 1 and Youth\nB as well. Supervisor reported Youth A and Youth B were very\ngood friends, so she believes some of Youth A’s tension with Staff\n1 comes from Staff 1’s tense relationship with Youth B. Supervisor\nreported Youth A and Youth B would be escalated separately and\nthen come together to brag about how escalated they each were\ntowards staff (not just towards Staff 1). Supervisor reported she\ncame back from leave at the beginning of October 2024 and\nnoticed Staff 1 and Youth A weren’t very connected. Supervisor\nreported Youth A self-isolated from many staff and treated staff as\nwell as other youth poorly. Supervisor reported one time Youth A\nwent AWOL, and he only agreed to come back because they\ninformed him, he could be on the 3rd floor by himself with two staff\ninstead of being on the 2nd floor with everyone. Supervisor\nreported Youth A was on the 3rd floor for 1-2 months and decided\nto come back down to the 2nd floor a week ago. Supervisor\n3",
    "reported when Youth A was on the 3rd floor, he was assigned two\nstaff per shift daily, and the staff would rotate based on schedules.\nSupervisor reported Staff 1 was a part of the rotation of staff\nassigned. Supervisor reported despite Youth A’s requests, she\ncontinued to assign staff Youth A didn’t like because she wanted\nthem to build rapport. Supervisor reported the only staff Youth A\ncontinued not to like was Staff 1. Supervisor reported she learned\nabout the allegations because Youth A finished a phone call with a\nchild advocate, then asked Staff 4 to get Staff 2 because Staff 2\nspeaks French like Youth A. This occurred around 1/30/25. Youth\nA told Staff 2, he wanted to speak with Supervisor, and she\nhappened to be on call. Supervisor reported she facetimed with\nYouth A and Youth A reported he was tired of running, tired of\nacting, wanted to do better, wanted to feel/be okay, and wanted to\ngo to school. Supervisor reported Youth A said the only request\nhe had was not to have Staff 1 assigned to him. Supervisor asked\nYouth A why and Youth A said every time Staff 1 was assigned to\nhim, he would have a report written about him and he would get in\ntrouble. Youth A stated Staff 1 makes him feel uncomfortable\nbecause she stuck her tongue out at him once and Staff 1 told\nYouth A she was “tired of him”. Youth A told Supervisor he spoke\nto Therapist about his concerns. Supervisor called Staff 1 and told\nher she could switch out her future assignments to Youth A with\nsomeone else. Supervisor called Therapist to update her, and\nTherapist called Youth A to speak with him further. Supervisor\nreported a few days later she spoke to Staff 1 to try and gauge\nwhat happened between Staff 1 and Youth A from Staff 1’s\nperspective. Staff 1 told Supervisor there was a lot of tension, and\nthey weren’t getting along with each other. Staff 1 said Youth A\nwould look at her up and down her body frequently and Youth A\nmade a comment about Staff 1’s daughter, which is where the\ntension began and when Staff 1 began feeling uncomfortable.\nStaff 1 said Youth A then cussed her out and they stopped talking\nto each other. Staff 1 reported she has since attempted\ncommunicating with Youth A, but Youth A hasn’t reciprocated\ncontact. Supervisor reported the most recent time Youth A went\nAWOL (1/18/25), Staff 1, Staff 5 and Staff 7 were looking for him.\nSupervisor reported after they found Youth A and Youth A went\ninto the van, Youth A made some kind of threat towards Staff 1\nand Staff 1’s response (according to Staff 5) was “I’m not afraid of\nyou”. Supervisor reported she felt the immediate response was\nnot appropriate. Supervisor reported that’s the only concern any\nstaff have brought to her regarding Staff 1 and Youth A.\nSupervisor reported she didn’t speak to Staff 1 about the specific\nallegations but asked if Staff 1 recalled anything she might have\n4",
    "done to make Youth A feel uncomfortable. Supervisor reported\nStaff 1 was very deflective, and said she didn’t do anything.\nSupervisor asked Staff 1 to think about whether she ever had a\npower struggle or argument with him and then provided Staff 1\nwith some guides and advice for how to handle those situations\n(i.e. self-criticism from peers, power struggles, how to self-\nregulate). Supervisor also reminded Staff 1 she was the adult in\nthe situation and explained Youth A’s trauma history. Supervisor\nreported Staff 1 didn’t respond well and acted as though\nSupervisor was judging her. Staff 1 said, “so you just want me to\nact like a robot and show no emotion?”. Supervisor told her that’s\nnot what she expected, and requested Staff 1 have more patience\nand understanding for Youth A, as well as put his past trauma into\nperspective in her interactions with him. Supervisor reported she\ndidn’t feel like Staff 1 took the information well. Supervisor\nreported she told Staff 1 she would check in with her on a regular\nbasis to continue to process the situation. Supervisor told Staff 1\nalthough Youth A stated he didn’t want to interact with Staff 1,\nStaff 1 could still be on the same area/floor as Youth A if Staff 1\ndid not speak with Youth A.\nTherapist was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/7/25. Therapist reported about a week and a half ago, she\nasked Youth A how his relationships were with staff. Youth A\nreported his relationships with staff are fine except for Staff 1.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 is “no good”, “just likes to play games”,\nand “pretends to be a good person, but is not a good person”.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 has gotten him in trouble a lot. Youth A\ndid not provide any specific examples of what, why, how or when\nany of these incidents occurred. Therapist reported she\nencouraged Youth A to speak directly with staff if he has a\nproblem so they can work out what the issue is. Therapist\nreported she didn’t hear anything else about it until these\nallegations came up. Therapist reported she spoke with Youth A\nand Youth A said Staff 1 stuck her tongue out at him when she\nwas leaving one time. Youth A also reported Staff 1 was “being\nmean” to him but could not provide any examples of what he\nmeant. Youth A told Therapist the last time he ran away it was\nbecause he didn’t want Staff 1 there. Youth A told Therapist Staff\n1 said, “you’re not going to tell me what to do. Wherever you go,\nand whatever you do, I’m going to be here no matter what”, which\nhe said felt combative. Youth A reported he became upset about\nwhat Staff 1 said, which is why he went AWOL. Youth A reported\nhe ran up to a random guy on the street and asked to use the\nguy’s phone, but Staff 1 came up and said, “he’s not in any\ndanger. There’s nothing to worry about”. Youth A reported he was\n5",
    "mad Staff 1 came up and intervened. Therapist reported she didn’t\nfeel like Youth A provided many details or examples for the claims\nhe is making. Therapist reported he could not provide timeframes,\nwho else was around when the incidents happened, etc. except\nfor the day he went AWOL. Therapist reported she has never\nwitnessed Youth A’s interactions with Staff 1.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 2/24/25. Staff 1 reported\nshe began having tension with Youth A because she set\nboundaries with him, and he didn’t like it. Staff 1 reported she felt\nYouth A was sexually harassing her (i.e. body scanning her from\nhead to toe, looking too long at her chest, gawk at her for long\nperiods of time, told her she was pretty frequently, asked if she\nhad a daughter in college & said if her daughter looked like her, he\nwould marry her, etc.). Staff 1 reported after the comment about\nher daughter, she put a firm boundary in place, and when she did\nthat, Youth A went to Supervisor and told Supervisor, Staff 1 was\nbeing mean. Staff 1 explained to Supervisor why she put the\nboundary in place and reported she felt uncomfortable due to\nYouth A’s advances. Staff 1 explained Youth A has also\nthreatened her with violence, which she also reported to\nSupervisor. Staff 1 reported from then on, she was scared for her\nown safety and didn’t want anything bad on her record, so she put\nsome distance between her and Youth A and respected Youth A’s\nspace. Staff 1 reported she loves her job and will do anything to\nensure youth are comfortable, safe, and relaxed while waiting for\ntheir case to be settled. Staff 1 reported she tried to make herself\ninvisible to Youth A, not provoke Youth A or not escalate Youth A.\nStaff 1 reported she tried to avoid him as much as possible. For\nexample, Youth A did not like going on outings, so Staff 1 would\ngo on outings, so she wasn’t left behind with Youth A. Staff 1\nreported if she was around Youth A, she would smile at him to be\nnice, but Youth A would glare at her in return. Staff 1 reported she\nheard from other staff Youth A hated her and didn’t want any\nconnection or bond with her, so she invested herself in creating\nrelationships with other youth instead. Staff 1 reported once Youth\nA was on the 3rd floor and assigned two staff per shift daily, she\nwas assigned to go up there and she brought up concerns with\nher assignment to Supervisor. Supervisor told her to continue with\nthe assignment to 3rd floor to repair her relationship with Youth A,\nbut when Staff 1 went there, Youth A rejected her. Staff 1 reported\nshe was then allowed to find someone to cover her assignment.\nStaff 1 reported she had a lot of anxiety about being assigned to\nsupervise Youth A and expressed that to Supervisor. Staff 1\nreported another time in January 2025, she was assigned to the\n3rd floor with Youth A, and she brought her concerns to Supervisor\n6",
    "again. Youth A had already gone AWOL in the morning, so Staff 1\nknew as soon as Youth A saw her, he would likely go AWOL\nagain because he had already said previously, he would not be in\nany space Staff 1 was in. Staff 1 reported she was told to go to the\n3rd floor anyway, so she did. Staff 1 reported as soon as she got to\nthe 3rd floor, Youth A said, “I don’t want you up here”. Staff 1\nreported she responded stating, “I’m sorry, I’m just doing my job”,\nand she repeated the same phrase every time he said he didn’t\nwant her there. Staff 1 reported Youth A went AWOL and told her\nnot to follow him. Staff 1 told Youth A it was her job, and she had\nto follow him if he went AWOL. Staff 1 reported while Youth A was\nAWOL, he went up to a random woman and her kids and asked to\nuse the woman’s phone. Staff 1 reported the woman looked\nuncomfortable, so Staff 1 intervened, which Youth A was unhappy\nabout. Staff 1 reported when Youth A finally got into the staff van,\nhe said, “by the end of the day, something is going to happen to\nyou, I promise”. Staff 1 reported Staff 5 witnessed this interaction,\nand Staff 1 reported this threat to Supervisor. Staff 1 reported\nshortly after, she was once again assigned to Youth A on the 3rd\nfloor, so she spoke to Supervisor about her concerns again. Staff\n1 reported she told Supervisor she was having a panic attack and\nhad a bad feeling about going up there because it would provoke\nStaff 1. However, Supervisor told Staff 1 Youth A was having a\ngood week, and it would be a good time for her to try and repair a\nbond with him, so she needed to proceed with her assignment.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was having a phone call downstairs, so\nshe went down and stood against a wall where Youth A couldn’t\nsee her. Staff 1 reported Youth A said he wanted to speak to a\nstaff who spoke his language, so Staff 2 came down. Staff 2 and\nYouth A called Supervisor, and Youth A was yelling at Supervisor\nover the phone. Staff 1 reported she hadn’t seen Youth A that day,\nhadn’t spoken to him, hadn’t mentioned his name, etc., but Youth\nA saw her downstairs and was very upset Staff 1 was assigned to\nhim again. Staff 1 reported she was then switched out with\nanother staff. Staff 1 reported she has never stuck her tongue out\nat Youth A, never told him she’s tired of him, never purposely\nsought him out to irritate him, done anything to bully him or said\nanything to the extent of “poking the bear” when speaking about\nhim. Staff 1 reported her goal every day has been to avoid Youth\nA so as not to provoke him or escalate him further.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 2/10/25. Staff 2 reported\nhe has never noticed Staff 1 having inappropriate interactions with\nany youth. Staff 2 reported there has been issues between Staff 1\nand Youth A, which has caused them not to speak to each other.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A had a crush on Staff 1 and Staff 1 told\n7",
    "Youth A to stop because it was inappropriate. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 told him Youth A was mad at her for rejecting him. Staff 2\nreported Youth A said he felt uncomfortable around Staff 1 and felt\nlike Staff 1 provoked him. Staff 2 reported one day, Youth A ran\naway and Staff 1 as well as two other staff (unsure who) picked\nYouth A up. Staff 2 reported Youth A told him when Staff 1 came\non the 3rd floor, Youth A told her he was going to run and Staff 1\nsaid, “if you want to run, run, I’m ready to go after you”. Staff 2\nreported Youth A said he felt like that was Staff 1 provoking him,\nso he ended up running away. Staff 2 reported he has not seen\nStaff 1 do anything towards Youth A to provoke him. Staff 2\nreported he has never seen Staff 1 stick her tongue out at Youth\nA, tell him she’s tired of him, or treat him bad in any way. Staff 2\nreported towards the end of January, Youth A told Staff 2 he was\ngoing to do something bad to Staff 1 if she ever talked to him\nagain, but Youth A didn’t specify what he meant. Staff 2 reported\nhe told Staff 1 the information and he believed Staff 1 told a\nsupervisor about it, but he isn’t sure who or if she did.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/7/25.\nStaff 3 reported she has not witnessed any big incidents between\nStaff 1 and Youth A. Staff 3 reported she feels Staff 1 lets her\nemotions get in the way of the work they do at the facility. Staff 3\nreported when Youth B was at the facility, he was frequently\nescalated and frustrated with her. Youth B would yell at Staff 1\nand tell her to stop talking to him. However, instead of walking\naway, Staff 1 would match his energy, raise her voice and say, “I\ndon’t even talk to you”. Staff 3 reported one day Youth A was in a\nconference room and staff were checking on him throughout the\ntime he was in there. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 came down and said,\n“I really want to poke the bear, but I won’t” in reference to\ninteracting with Youth A. Staff 3 reported this incident happened\napproximately 3 months ago, but Staff 1 never entered the room\nor interacted with Youth A. Staff 3 reported another time Youth A\nwas getting ready to leave, and Staff 1 had her coat on and said,\n“where are we going? Are we going on a walk?”. Youth A told\nStaff 1 not to follow him, and Staff 1 said, “you’re not going to tell\nme what to do. You’re not my boss.”. Staff 3 reported this\noccurred about a month ago when Youth A went AWOL. Staff 3\nreported she wasn’t present for this situation and didn’t hear\nexactly what was said and didn’t see what happened, but Staff 1\ntold her what happened. Staff 3 reported she hasn’t witnessed any\nother situations where Staff 1 has provoked Youth A, and in the\nlast two months she hasn’t worked with Staff 1 when they’ve been\naround Youth A. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 has a playful personality.\nStaff 3 gave an example that one time the youth were doing\n8",
    "homework, and Staff 1 pushed the youths’ papers on the floor, or\nkicked the chairs they were sitting in. Staff 3 reported Staff 1’s\nlanguage is also sometimes not appropriate around the youth but\ncouldn’t provide any examples. Staff 3 reported she feels Staff 1 is\ntrying to be playful, not hurtful, but sometimes Staff 1’s\ninteractions come across as inappropriate.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 2/10/25. Staff 4 reported\nYouth A has never talked to her about Staff 1 or complained about\nStaff 1. Staff 4 reported she has witnessed Staff 1 and Youth A\ninteract a few times. Staff 4 reported at the beginning, they\nseemed to get along well, but the past few times she has seen\nthem interact, she’s noticed a level of discomfort from each of\nthem. Staff 4 reported she’s not sure what’s causing them to be\nuncomfortable around each other. Staff 4 reported when Youth A\nwas on the 3rd floor, Staff 1 was scheduled to work a shift with\nStaff 4 and Youth A stated he was not a fan of Staff 1, and if she\nwas going to be on the 3rd floor, he wasn’t going to be. Staff 4\nreported the other couple times she has been scheduled to work\non the 3rd floor with Staff 1, Staff 1 has had to switch out with\nanother staff because Youth A doesn’t want Staff 1 there. Staff 4\nreported Youth A has never explained why he doesn’t want Staff 1\nthere. Staff 4 reported the only thing she has ever heard Staff 1\nsay to Youth A in response is, “this is my job. I’m assigned to be\nhere, and I’m going to follow what my supervisors tell me to do”.\nStaff 4 reported she never felt like Staff 1 said it to provoke Youth\nA. In fact, Staff 4 reported she felt Staff 1 seemed nervous about\nsetting a boundary with Youth A when she said it. Staff 4 reported\nshe has never seen Staff 1 do or say anything that would be\nconsidered bullying, provoking, or inappropriate towards Youth A\nor any other youth.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 2/24/25. Staff 5 reported\nhe has observed positive interactions between Staff 1 and the\nyouth at the facility. Staff 5 reported Staff 1 is a hard worker and is\nalways ready to work. Staff 5 reported sometimes Staff 1 will bend\nthe rules a bit to please youth, but never in an inappropriate or\nunsafe way. For example, Staff 1 will sometimes let the youth play\nmusic with bad words in it even though they’re not supposed to.\nStaff 5 reported he hasn’t noticed any inappropriate interactions\nbetween Staff 1 and Youth A. Staff 5 reported Staff 1 told him\nYouth A was looking at her in a sexual way one day, and it made\nher uncomfortable. Staff 5 reported he has not seen any bullying\nbehavior by Staff 1 towards Youth A. Staff 5 reported when Youth\nA first arrived at the facility, he and Staff 1 got along well.\nHowever, one night, Youth A wasn’t following the rules, and Staff\n9",
    "1 continued to enforce the rules. Youth A didn’t like Staff 1\nenforcing the rules or telling him what to do, and there’s been\ntension between them ever since. Staff 1 has told Staff 5 she is\nnot afraid of Youth A, but Staff 5 reported Staff 1 has not said that\ndirectly to Youth A to his knowledge. Staff 5 reported in January\n2025, Staff 5 entered the floor, and Staff 1 told him not to take off\nhis jacket because Youth A wanted to run away. Youth A was\ngetting ready to leave and said, “tell her not to follow me”, and\nthen walked off the floor. Staff 5 reported he asked Youth A later\nwhy he went AWOL and Youth A said he wasn’t going to run\naway, but Staff 1 provoked him, so he did. Staff 5 reported Youth\nA would not provide details as to what Staff 1 did to provoke him.\nStaff 5 reported he has never witnessed Staff 1 provoking Youth\nA.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/7/25.\nStaff 6 reported Staff 1 has interacted professionally with the\nyouth, and he hasn’t witnessed anything odd or inappropriate in\nher interactions with them. Staff 6 reported he has never seen or\nheard about Staff 1 bullying Youth A, sticking her tongue out at\nhim, saying anything inappropriate to him, or treating him bad.\nStaff 6 reported one-time Youth A was throwing things at Staff 1,\nand it made her scared. Staff 6 reported at the next staff meeting,\nStaff 1 cried and was very emotional about what happened. Staff\n6 reported Youth A frequently had behaviors towards other youth\nand staff (i.e. verbal abuse, cussing at them, not doing\nchores/responsibilities). Staff 6 reported due to behaviors, Youth A\nspent some time on the 3rd floor as the only youth and was always\nassigned two staff. Staff 6 reported within the last week, Youth A\nhas moved back down to the 2nd floor and his behaviors have\nimproved greatly.\nStaff 7 was interviewed via phone on 2/10/25. Staff 7 reported\nshe has witnessed interactions between Youth A and Staff 1 a\ncouple times. Staff 7 reported Staff 1 is outspoken, but never\naggressive. Staff 7 reported she is not sure what the issue is\nbetween Youth A and Staff 1, but notices there is tension between\nthem. Staff 7 reported when Youth A is escalated, Staff 1 kind of\n“pokes the bear”. Staff 7 reported one day she was assigned to\nYouth A, and he was upset. Staff 7 reported Staff 1 came around\nto see what Youth A was doing and Staff 7 felt like Staff 1 was just\nbeing nosey by coming around despite knowing Youth A doesn’t\nlike her presence. Staff 7 reported sometimes Staff 1 will say\nthings to Youth A like, “I’m here to do my job”, and leave it at that.\nStaff 7 reported she’s never seen Staff 1 outwardly bully Youth A,\nlaugh at him, stick her tongue out at him or say anything\n10",
    "inappropriate to him like “I’m tired of you”. Staff 7 reported when\nYouth A is in a bad mood, Staff 1 will talk louder, but Staff 7 wasn’t\nsure Staff 1’s intention behind it and could not provide any\nexamples of things Staff 1’s said louder in Youth A’s presence.\nStaff 7 reported she informed Youth A if he feels uncomfortable,\nfeels like a staff is bullying him, or anything else, he is allowed to\nmake a report about it and staff can assist him.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident report dated 1/18/25 authored by Program\nManager was written due to endangerment to staff by\nyouth.
