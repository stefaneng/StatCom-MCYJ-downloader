As a result, there has been notable performance improvement in\nthis area.\nThe CA indicated the agency as well as the subcontracted PAFC's continue to\nstruggle with staff turnover and vacancies that take time to backfill. The agency\ndeveloped a workforce stabilization plan with each subcontracted PAFC to\naddress these concerns. The Chief Administrator expressed confidence that there\nwill be continued improvement over the next review period.\nFinancial Overview\nFinancial records were reviewed and there were no concerns identified.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by supervisors and coworkers. Staff did not report any areas of needs\nor concerns.",
