    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program Statement.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Reports of concern for multiple runaway children who ultimately\nbecome recovered by law enforcement. Often, the children are\nuntruthful with officers, combative and disobey direction given by\nofficers. There is a concern if the facility is fit to maintain the\nsafety of the children.\nInvestigation This complaint was received on 02/15/2024 via online agency\ncomplaint.\nI emailed and called Complainant on 02/16/2024, requesting\nadditional information regarding incidents and youths involved.\nNo additional information was provided.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Director on 02/20/2024 at the agency. Director\nreported the agency has several youths that AWOL frequently\nand the staff are expected to make all efforts to maintain eyesight\nof the youth. If youths leave the grounds, staff follow them as far\nas possible without endangering the youth's safety. If staff lose\neyesight of them, the police are contacted, and a missing\nperson’s report is filed. Director said all staff follow the agency\npolicy to ensure the safety of the children when they leave the\ncampus without permission. Staff attempt to verbally redirect the\nyouths when they AWOL, but staff cannot use any form of\nphysical management to stop the youth from AWOLing. Methodist\nis an open campus facility; the exit doors in the cottages are not\nsecure, and staff do not prevent children from leaving. Director\nsaid the youths that frequently AWOL are Youth A, Youth B, Youth\nC, and Youth D. Director said when youths return to campus, staff\nhave to take them to the police department to report their return,\n2",
    "but sometimes the youths refuse to go with staff to the police\ndepartment. Director has been in communication with Detective 2\nto figure out a plan to document those incidents.\nI interviewed Youth A on 02/20/2024 at the agency. Youth A is 14\nyears old, has been at the agency for 6 months, and is placed in\nHarrison Cottage. Youth A reported there is usually two staff\nmembers in the cottage. He admitted to leaving the cottage\nwithout permission. He said staff try to talk to him and stop him\nfrom AWOLing, but he has friends in the neighborhood and feels\nit is safe for him to leave the campus. Youth A said staff follow\nhim on foot and sometimes they follow him in the agency van.\nYouth A said when he returns to campus, staff search him by\nemptying his pockets, and using a metal detector wand. Youth A\nreported he gets enough food, has clean clothes and hygiene\nproducts, and feels safe.\nI interviewed Youth B on 02/20/2024 at the agency. Youth B is 17\nyears old, has been at the agency for one year, and is placed in\nJuhnke Cottage. Youth B reported there is always two staff\nmembers supervising, staff do try to redirect him from leaving,\nand staff try to follow him to maintain line of sight. Youth B said he\ngets enough to eat, takes his medication daily, participates in\nweekly group and individual therapy, and feels safe. Youth B\ndenied having any concerns regarding staff or the agency.\nI interviewed Youth C on 02/20/2024 at the agency. Youth C is 11\nyears old, has been at the agency for 7 months, and is placed in\nHarrison Cottage. Youth C admitted he AWOLs a lot, because he\nlikes to go to the stores and walks around the neighborhood.\nYouth C said staff do follow him, try to talk him out of leaving the\ncampus, and search him when he comes back to campus. Youth\nC said when he AWOLs, staff do follow him on foot and\nsometimes in the agency van to maintain line of sight. Youth C\nsaid he gets enough to eat, all his needs are being met, and feels\nsafe.\nI interviewed Youth D on 02/20/2024 at the agency. Youth D is 17\nyears old, has been at the agency for 4 months, and is placed in\nJuhnke Cottage. Youth D admitted he AWOLs sometimes, and\nstaff do try to stop him by talking to him and following him. Youth\nD expressed no concerns regarding the agency or staff and feels\nsafe. Youth D said staff search him after the AWOL using a metal\ndetector wand and emptying his pockets.\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 on 02/20/2024 at the agency. Staff 1 has\nbeen working at the agency for 4 months and has completed all\ntraining including CPI. She works 2nd shift in Harrison Cottage.\nShe said there is always two staff and one supervisor in the\ncottage. Staff 2 said when Youths AWOL, staff try to verbally\nredirect youths to prevent them from leaving and will follow the\nyouth as far as possible as to not put the youth in danger. Staff\nwill follow the youth on foot or by using the agency van. If staff\ncannot get them to come back, the staff will contact the\nsupervisor and file a police report. An incident report is also\nwritten when a Youth AWOLs, the supervisor reviews this report,\nand sends out notifications to the Parent/Guardian and Foster\nCare Worker. Staff 1 reported no safety concerns for the youths.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the agency. Supervisor 1 has been\nworking at the agency for 12 years. Supervisor 1 reported staff\nfollow the agency policy and do everything they can to\ndiscourage the youths from AWOLing. He said staff try verbal\nredirection, will offer alternatives (such as going to the gym), staff\nfollow the youth as far as possible to maintain line of sight and to\nensure the youth is not put in danger. The staff always report the\nAWOL to the supervisor, file a missing person report with the\npolice department and complete an incident report. He is not\naware of any incidents where youths left the campus and staff\ndidn’t follow them nor file any police reports. Supervisor 1 said if a\nstaff member is not available to follow a youth the supervisor or\ndirector will follow the youth to ensure they have enough staff to\nstay in ratio.\nI interviewed Detective 1 with the Livonia Police Department via\ntelephone on 02/27/2024. Detective 1 said there is no police\nreports or incidents involving youths at Methodist. He said his\nmain concern is staff do not prevent or stop youths from leaving\nthe campus.\nI interviewed Detective 2 with Redford Police Department via\ntelephone on 03/06/2024. Detective 2 reported he does not have\nconcerns regarding the agency not reporting AWOLs. He said\nthey receive many calls from the agency for police assistance\ndue to the youths assaulting staff and destroying property at the\nagency.\nI interviewed Youth B’s Foster Care Worker (FCW) via telephone\non 2/20/2024. She reported the agency does notify her timely and\nkeeps her updated on Youth B’s behavior and AWOLs. FCW said\nher only issue is the incident reports are handwritten and the writing\nis not very clear, and reports need to be more detailed.\n4",
    "Documents Reviewed:\n• Agency AWOL policy. Staff are expected to make all efforts\nto maintain eyesight of the youth(s). If youths leave the\ngrounds, staff should get a van and follow them. If youths\nAWOL but stay on campus and go into the woods, staff\nshould contact the supervisor, follow calmly on foot, and\nverbally attempt to return them. Staff must follow youths as\nfar as possible without endangering their own safety. If\nyouths retreat further into the woods and staff lose eyesight\nof them, the police should be contacted, a missing person’s\nreport filed, and when a youth returns to campus notify\npolice.\n• Agency policy: Child Supervision: 2. Agency schedules staff\nto maintain a 4:1 ratio. Staff strive to maintain this ratio,\nthough there will be times when staff cannot, such as when a\nchild goes AWOL, or during a restraint. This does not mean\nthat staff are out of ratio because there are ample staff\nscheduled to respond to the child issues.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with the rule based on interviews and\ndocumentations reviewed confirmed staff follow agency policy\nregarding youths’ safety and AWOLs. The agency is an open\ncampus, the exit doors in the cottages are not secure, and do not\nprevent children from leaving. Further, staff are not permitted to\nphysically restrain children to prevent them from leaving.\nIt was recommended that Methodist’s Administration meet with the\nlocal police to educate them on the agency program and policy.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe agency was advised to ensure all incident reports include all\ndetails of the incident and are written clearly.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMarch 25, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 2, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n6"
