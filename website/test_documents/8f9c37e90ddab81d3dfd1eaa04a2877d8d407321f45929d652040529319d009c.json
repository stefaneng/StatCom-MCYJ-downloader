    "ALLEGATION:\nThe agency collected Youth A’s belongings and will not return them to Youth A or his\nmother.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 10/12/20 it was reported to DCWL that when Youth A entered foster care at\nanother agency, he had a PlayStation 3 game console that belonged to his mother.\nYouth A was allowed to take the game system with him to his first placement. Later,\nYouth A received an Xbox One game console as a gift from his mother. The case\nthen transferred to Bethany Christian Services. The mother’s parental rights were\nlater terminated. Youth A and his mother were no longer supposed to have contact.\nHowever, Youth A contacted his mother and explained that both game systems were\ntaken by his case worker when he moved to a residential facility. When Youth A later\nmoved to a foster home, the game systems were not returned by the agency. In\naddition, the agency has taken two cell phones from Youth A and has not returned\nthem. The mother contacted the agency and requested to have the items back, if\nthey are not going to return them to Youth A. The agency has not complied with this\nrequest.\nOn 10/13/20 a review of Youth A’s case file was completed. Youth A is 17 years old.\nParental rights were terminated on 7/29/19. Youth A’s case transferred to Bethany\non 10/19/2018. His placements were as follows:\n 10/19/18-7/16/19, Foster Home 1\n 7/16/19-7/30/19, Crossroads (residential)\n 7/30/19-11/15/19, Foster Home 2\n 11/15/19-5/27/20, Crossroads\n 5/27/20-6/16/20, Foster Home 3\n 6/17/20-7/29/20, Foster Home 4\n 7/29/20- present, Independent Living\nSupervisor\nOn 10/28/20 the Supervisor stated that the agency has a system in place for\nchildren’s belongings. The items the agency received for Youth A were kept in\nstorage bins at the office. The Supervisor reported that Parent 1 picked up her\nbelongings from their office on 10/16/20. An email chain among staff was reviewed,\ndetailing the arrangements for Parent 1 to gather the Xbox One and a gaming\nheadset. The PlayStation could not be located; it is unknown when Youth A last had\nit, as the former caseworker believed he traded it to another youth while placed in a\nresidential facility in 2019.\nThe Supervisor noted that the Foster Care worker was assigned to this case from\n10/19/2018 to 8/14/2020. However, Parent 1 somehow obtained the worker’s\npersonal phone number and began threatening her. Most recently Parent 1 obtained\n3",
    "the worker’s home address and went to the worker’s home in the middle of the night\ndemanding the game systems. This resulted in a Personal Protection Order and a\nchange of worker. The worker also installed a home security system due on ongoing\nthreats and harassment from Parent 1.\nParent 1\nYouth A’s mother was contacted on 10/12/20 and 10/28/20 for additional\ninformation. On 10/29/20, Parent 1 reported that she requested the missing items\nfrom the former case worker on several occasions, but did not receive a response.\nParent 1 was eventually contacted by the office manager and arranged to obtain the\ngame system on 10/16/20. Parent 1 picked up a bag from the agency which\ncontained the Xbox One, one game, and two headsets. Parent 1 stated there was\nabout $1,000 worth of games and equipment missing, although she did not have any\ndetails about the missing items, games and equipment.\nParent 1 reported that she was previously able to obtain one cell phone from the\nagency, after threatening the caseworker with a lawyer. Therefore, as of 10/29/20\nParent 1 reports the current missing items to be a PlayStation and a second cell\nphone.\nYouth A\nOn 11/18/20 Youth A was contacted on his personal cell phone and interviewed.\nYouth A confirmed that he had a PlayStation, which belonged to his mother (Parent\n1), when he first entered care. Youth A later received an Xbox One as a gift from his\nmother. Youth A stated that he last had the two game systems while living in a foster\nhome, prior to his last stay at a residential facility. The Foster Care Worker took the\nXbox and put it in to storage. Youth A could not recall what happened to the\nPlayStation. Youth A stated he had two cell phones at one point, but he could not\nrecall when he last had those. Youth A stated that his worker said he could have his\nbelongings back once he moved out of the residential placement. However, Youth A\nis now in an independent living placement, and has not received the game systems\nor cell phones.\nProgram Director\nOn 11/20/20 the Program Director (PD) was contacted regarding the agency\npolicy/procedure about the storage of youth’s personal belongings. The PD reported\nthat the agency does not keep a specific inventory of the items stored in the office.\nThe PD reported that a cell phone, which was in Youth A’s possession previously,\nwas returned to Parent 1 during parenting time on 12/28/18.\nThe PD reported that Youth A packed his own belongings, and had two gaming\nsystems and a cell phone when he went to Crossroads residential facility (7/16/19-\n7/30/19). That cell phone was never placed in the care of Bethany. When parental\nrights were terminated in July 2019, Parent 1 demanded to have the PlayStation\nreturned to her. The previous FCW returned the game system.\n4",
    "Youth A was then placed in a foster home from 7/30/19-11/15/19, where he had all\nof his belongings. When Youth A moved to residential on 11/15/19 he packed his\nown belongings at the foster home and unpacked at the residential facility. Youth A\ndetermined what items he wanted to keep in his possession, including his cell\nphone. The other items, including the Xbox, were then immediately returned to the\noffice, packed in a tote, and locked in storage.\nThe Program Director stated that the agency generally does not store many items\nfor children. However, when required, they have a locked shed outdoors, where\nyouth belongs are kept in labeled totes. The key for this shed is held by the office\nmanager and removal of items is monitored. Regarding Youth A, this procedure was\nfollowed, except for the Xbox system. Youth A’s FCW was concerned about the\ngame system being in the cold, therefore the system was locked in the Program\nDirector’s office.\nAfter leaving residential, Youth A requested to have his Xbox returned. The former\nFCW denied his request at that time and kept the Xbox in storage. This decision was\nmade for a few reasons: Youth A did not have a stable placement; Youth A needed\nto focus on his goals and safety planning due to the risks presented by his parents\nregarding his safety and well-being; Parent 1 had previously utilized technology to\ntrack Youth A and his sibling, to determine the location of their foster home and\ncommunicate with the children when it was not allowed.\nRecently, when Youth A began Independent Living all of his belongings were\nreturned to him, except for the Xbox. This was an admitted oversight by the agency,\nsimply because it was not in the tote with his other belongings.\nThe Program Director noted that she received text messages around 1:00AM on\n10/12/20 from the previous FCW, stating that Parent 1 was sending her threatening\nmessages on her personal cell phone, and standing outside of her house. The\nmessages were regarding the Xbox. Following that incident, arrangements were\nmade to have Parent 1 pick the Xbox up in the agency lobby. Parent 1 picked up the\ngame system on 10/16/20.\nDocuments reviewed\nA copy of the 10/13/2020 PPO against Parent 1 was reviewed.\nThe agency’s policy regarding personal possessions was reviewed and found to\nfocus on adequate clothing for youth while in care. The policy does not address\nadditional personal items, as the rule does not specifically require this. However, TA\nwas provided to the agency to add this information, as contract/policy does require\nthis information.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12303 Policy and procedures.\n(2) Policies and procedures shall cover all of the following\nareas and be on forms provided, and in a manner prescribed,\nby the department:\n(m) Personal possessions.\nANALYSIS: Regarding the allegation of missing items, Parent 1 confirmed\nreceiving one game system and one cell phone. However, due to\nconflicting information from Parent 1, Youth A, the agency, and a\nlack of documentation to support either side, it could not be\ndetermined what happened to the other cell phone and game\nsystem.\nA violation is found due to the agency failing to document the\nyouth’s personal belongings on the form provided by the department\n(DHHS 3377), and in a manner prescribed by the department. FOM\n903-09 states the DHHS 3377 must be completed “within the first 30\ncalendar days of every placement and again at every placement\nchange”. This form was not completed at placement changes to\ndocument the youth’s belongings.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an approved corrective action plan, I recommend no change to the\ncurrent license.\nDecember 4, 2020\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 9, 2020\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
