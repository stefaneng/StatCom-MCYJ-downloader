TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Several items were not uploaded into the MiSACWIS system and we\ndiscussed the importance of developing a system to ensure that staff are\naware and following through appropriately. The agency was receptive and\nreport that they will develop a system for compliance. We discussed different\nways of developing methods to ensure a positive change.\n Social work contacts were not always checked appropriately.
