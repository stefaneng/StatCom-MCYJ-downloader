He also\nhas a faint healing bruise and scrape to his lower back, a small\nscratch to his buttocks and behind his right knee as well. The\nfacility was unaware of any incident reports or of injuries to Youth\nA.\nI observed Youth A at another facility with DHHS Worker and\nComplainant on 02/22/2023.

Youth A’s left shoulder appeared\nirritated with fingernail scratches, as well as a scratch to the left\nmiddle torso, and a cut to his right upper inner leg.

He reports not previously observing the leg\nscratch until completing the body chart. Staff Person 3 states\nYouth A has a history of scratching, noting that the facility thought\nit may have been due to the soap and changed it to a mild brand.\nStaff Person 3 states he observed Youth A to have outbursts to\ninclude tearing up his bedroom, screaming, stripping down naked,\nand scratching at his face. He does not recall ever witnessing\nYouth A throw himself to the floor but states he could see Youth A\ndoing it. Staff Person 3 does not know if the nurse has seen him\nfor every scratch, but states Youth A has been to the hospital for\nhis bowels and skin irritation. Staff Person 3 states staff are good\nwith him and notes that he has heard of him running outside and\nthat he has a one-on-one as his safety plan. He reports Youth A\nenjoys taking frequent showers as his coping skill.\nYouth B was interviewed onsite with DHHS Worker on\n03/03/2023. He reports knowing Youth A during his placement\nand notes that he AWOL’d frequently by walking away from the\ngroup and that staff were required to follow him.\nI reviewed the following incident reports:\n01/11/2023 incident report notes Youth A scratching his\nchest and body due to dryness after showering. It also\nnotes him hitting his thighs causing redness. Scratches,\nredness and a little bleeding were noted to the chest, thighs,\nand back of neck and arms. Antibiotic cream applied.\n02/19/2023 incident report notes Youth A being given a\nshower and changed. Youth A started to run back and forth\nand then ran out the back door and was escorted back\ninside by Staff Person 2. No injuries noted.\n02/19/2023 incident report notes Youth A exiting building to\nbe escorted back by Staff Person 2. Supervisor 2 then\nassumed one-on-one responsibilities and brought Youth A\ndownstairs. Youth A ran out the back door and into the\nalley area and dropped his body to the ground to prevent\nbeing escorted back. Shower given and scratch on leg\nnoted.\n02/20/2023 incident report notes Youth A being showered\n4",
    "and was observed to have irritated skin from scratching skin\nand bruise to top left shoulder as if he bumped into\nsomething or fallen. Hygiene supply changed as possible\nreason for skin irritation. Youth A also self-harms when\nfrustrated. Bruise to shoulder, scratch marks to back, skin\nirritation to backs of both legs, scratch to back, and scratch\nunder eye noted, and antibiotic ointment applied.\nI reviewed the facility’s Critical Incident Response and Reporting\npolicy. The facility’s policy is to ensure safe, effective, and\ntransparent response to incidents of a critical nature. Physical\ninjury (client or to staff by client) is listed.\nDHHS Worker did not determine any findings on 03/22/2023.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to indicate that the facility did not have Youth\nA’s injuries documented as they are noted on the 02/19/2023 and\n02/20/2023 incident reports. Furthermore, the 01/11/2023 incident\nreport notes redness and scratches to Youth A’s chest, thighs,\nback of neck and arms. Youth A has a history of irritated skin\npredominantly on his left shoulder and scratching himself. The\n02/19/2023 incident report, where Youth A ran through a dip in the\nfield that contained brush, sticks and rocks, noted a scratch to his\nleg as observed by Supervisor 2 following the incident. The\ninjuries noted were sufficiently documented and do not rise to the\nlevel of serious injury requiring the notifications stipulated in the\nrule.\nTechnical Given Youth A is nonverbal and unable to explain how he\nAssistance received any scrapes, cuts, and bruises, staff are recommended\nto diligently examine such youth after all potential incidents in\nwhich harm could have resulted, document, and treat if deemed\nnecessary. It is further recommended that with such nonverbal\nyouth, that staff maintain a daily body-chart log to establish a\ntimeline of injuries or marks not documented during a critical\nincident in which an injury is immediately observed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n03/28/2023\n______________________________________\nChristopher M Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/06/2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n6"
