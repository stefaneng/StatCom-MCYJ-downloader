    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThe Audere Home is located in a two-story building with a walkout basement. The\ntwelve-bed facility is located in Kentwood, Michigan off a main street that is across\nfrom their main Wedgwood facility location. This allows this facility to be\ncompletely separated from the other secure licensed facilities located on\nWedgwood Campus to offer the youth a feeling of a true step-down program.\nUpon arrival at the facility, there is a designated parking lot and beautiful\nlandscaping to make the facility look like it blends in with the surrounding\napartment complexes.\nUpon walking through the front door, there is a main lobby where there is a staff\ndesk area to greet visitors. Once at the main desk area, there is a main hallway\nleading to each opposite side of the house. To the left of the main desk area there\nis a community area that is furnished with a TV, couches, and individual chairs on\none side of the room. There is also a storage closet and lockers where staff or\nyouth can keep their personal items. On the opposite side of the room there is a\nroom with a door that is set up for the youth to use as a video game area. At the\nend of the left side of the first floor there is an exit door and another office space\nthat will be used for the case manager.\nOnce back to the main entrance desk area to the right hallway, there is a doorway\nto the left that leads to the finished basement area. Also, on the left-hand side\nthere is a bathroom that youth will be able to use when they are on the first floor.\nOn the right side of the hallway there is an area where there will be a community\nphone for the youth to use where they can sit at a desk. This is right next to the\nstaff desk area, so if there needs to be supervised phone calls that can be\ncompleted. Further down the hallway to the left is the dining area where there are\ntables and chairs set up for the youth to eat at. Off the dining room area there is\nan exit door that leads to an outdoor patio area on a deck with a staircase that\nleads to the basketball court. To the right of the dining room there is another\nhangout area where the youth will be able to socialize and utilize the air hockey\ntable. This hangout area also has bay windows that show a lot of natural light. At\nthe end of this hallway is the kitchen area. The kitchen has two stoves, two ovens,\ntwo dishwashers, a sink, two refrigerators, and a pantry area. This will be a great\narea for the youth to learn life skills in cooking.\nWhen headed downstairs off this main hallway area, it leads to a walk out\nbasement. Within this area there is a lot of space for the youth to hang out in.\nThere are also two staff offices that will be located down there and three\nstorage/supply closets. The home supervisor and activity specialist will have their\noffices located down here. There is also the location of the locked utility closet. A\nbathroom located in the basement. The basement again is surrounded by multiple\nwindows to allow natural light. There are two exit doors in the basement that lead\nto the basketball court.

To the left and right of the main\ndoorway area there are doors that are locked which lead to the bedroom hallways.\nThis allows the youth’s bedrooms to be safe and monitored. Each door leads to\neither the male or female side of the building. Youth are able to exit from upstairs\non their own. Both hallways mirror one another with a staff office that is located\nbetween the hallways which again allows the female and male youth to be\nseparated. The staff office is a locked area that the youth cannot enter but staff\nwill be able to have access to both sides of the hallway and keep medications\nlocked. The staff office is where third shift staff will remain to ensure that\nbedrooms and bathrooms are monitored appropriately.

There is another locked\npantry in the laundry rooms where the locked chemicals will be kept for safety.\nEach hallway consists of five bedrooms where there will be one bedroom that has\ntwo beds, and the four other rooms will be single bedrooms. This allows up to six\nyouth to stay in each hallway, where each youth will have their own bed to sleep\nin. Each bedroom has its own window to allow for natural light. Each of the\nhallways consists of having two bathrooms which means there are four bathrooms\nin total in the main sleeping area.

There are no\ncameras located in the bedrooms or bathrooms.\nAn onsite walkthrough of the facility was completed on 08/13/2025.\nThe Fire Inspection was completed on 08/05/2025 stating Final Approval.\nThe Health Inspection was completed on 07/14/2025 and received an A rating.\nB.
