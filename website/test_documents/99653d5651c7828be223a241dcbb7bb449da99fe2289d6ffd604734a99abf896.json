INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents' needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency is not providing adequate services, resulting in a large\nnumber of youths going to the emergency department.\nInvestigation On 11/22/24 Complainant reported a concerning number of\nyouths from Vista Maria were dropped at local hospital emergency\ndepartments within the last 48 hours. There is concern the agency\nis not providing proper care and programming to prevent the youth\nfrom needing care in the emergency department.\nInterviews:\nChief Administrator, Rights Officer, and Quality Manager were\ncontacted on 11/22/24 by email to obtain the names of youth that\nwere seen at a hospital from 11/19/24-11/22/24.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth A stated that she felt the program was not helpful to her as\nthere were no independent livings skills being learned, due to staff\ndoing everything for them. Youth A stated they do not have any\ngroup activities. Therapy was 1-2 times per week. Youth could\ncolor or do word searches during their downtime on the unit, but\nthey did not have access to use the gym and could only go\noutside to the courtyard occasionally. Youth A stated they were\nnot able to go on outings often, due to peer behaviors. However,\nshe stated they went on walks occasionally and would walk to the\non-campus boutique to shop. Youth A acknowledged some staff\nwere more active with youth than others. Youth A stated if youth\nwere harming themselves, attacking staff, threatening suicide, or\nbreaking items to hurt themselves, staff would try to deescalate\nthe situation and talk to the youth about what is bothering them.\nStaff also suggest other activities they can do such as puzzles and\ngames. If nothing works, then a supervisor would make the\ndecision to call the police to help. If the police came, they would\n2",
    "usually take the youth to the hospital for a few hours. Then the\nyouth return to the facility. Staff would always go to the hospital\nwith youth.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth B reported attending school daily and therapy weekly.\nYouth on the unit also participated in groups that work on self-\nreflection, discussing concerns, motivating self and others.\nGroups were supposed to be twice per day, but that did not\nalways happen, due to peer behaviors. Youth B stated there were\nvolunteer groups that came in to do activities such as skill building\nand watching movies. The Dream Realized through\nEducation/Empowerment and Mentoring (DREAM) group taught\nindependent living skills, interview skills and social skills. Youth B\nfelt the program was doing a good job helping her learn how to be\non her own eventually. However, some peers would be upset at\nstaff for trying to get them to participate. Some peers were also\nupset with Youth B for listening to staff and being respectful and\nparticipating in activities. Youth B stated some peers caused\ntrouble when they did not want to participate in activities and did\nnot have anything else to do. Youth B felt there should be more\nconsequences for youth that cause problems. Police were called\nto the facility on occasion. Some supervisors called more than\nothers. Supervisors would call the police if a youth went truant,\nself-harmed, or assaulted staff. Staff would talk to youth and work\nthe problem out but would call the police if necessary. Police then\ntook the youth to the hospital. Staff followed the police and stayed\nat the hospital with youth. Youth then returned to the facility.\nOverall, Youth B felt there were some very good staff that provide\na lot of support.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nYouth C stated she did not like being at the facility as staff always\ncorrected her. Youth C identified activities on the unit such as\ncooking, movies, gym, games, crafts, and groups about making\ngood decisions. Youth C stated they were sometimes unable to do\nactivities when peers on the unit acted out and pulled staff\nattention away from the schedule. Staff would try to talk with the\nyouth, problem solve and deescalate. However, police were\nsometimes called to assist in transporting a youth that needed to\ngo to the hospital due to out of control behavior.\nYouth D was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth D stated they attended therapy weekly and found it to be\nhelpful. Youth D reported that groups were held daily, but she did\nnot always participate as it was usually an activity she did not\n3",
    "enjoy. Youth D reported she was able to make phone calls to\nfamily every day, and she was able to draw or read daily. Youth D\nstated there were no organized, recreational activities available to\nyouth and they sat on the unit all day, “doing nothing”. Youth D\nindicated Journey To Success (JTS) was a group of people that\ncame to the unit to do activities and independent living skills.\nHowever, JTS was no longer occurring. Youth D stated she\nwished they did more activities and included exercise or\nmovement daily. Youth D reported that some youth were able to\ngo on outings to go shopping. Youth D felt this was favoritism by\nstaff and not based on behavior, although she could not explain\nwhy. Youth D wished there were more outings and fun activities\nplanned. However, she acknowledged that behavior of youth\nimpacted staff ability to do things. Peer behavior would cause staff\nto be busy deescalating youth, rather than doing activities with the\nother youth. Youth D reported police were called to the facility\nwhen youth were physically acting out and creating weapons to\nhurt people. Staff would talk with the youth and remove dangerous\nitems. Police would be contacted for assistance. Youth D also\nobserved staff to call the police when a youth was suicidal, self-\nharming, or swallowing things, and they needed to go to the\nhospital to be evaluated. Staff would try to talk to youth and\nredirect them, but that did not always work. Youth D stated police\nalways took youth to the hospital and staff followed in another car.\nWhen asked what the facility could change to better meet the\nyouth needs, Youth D stated they needed to plan more outings to\nencourage the youth to have good behavior to earn those things.\nChief Administrator contacted DCWL via email on 12/20/24,\noutlining activities planned for youth during their holiday break\nfrom school. Activities included Science Technology Engineering\nMath (STEM) activities, basketball, holiday party, Lego activities,\nmovies, and a content creator workshop.\nRights Officer was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n1/15/25. Rights Officer reported the facility was partnering with\nWayne County Community Mental Health to complete on-site\nscreenings for Wayne MDHHS youth, to determine if they are in\nneed of short-term hospitalization. On 1/21/25 Rights Officer\nclarified via email that JTS was a program within Vista Maria that\norganized events such as groups and dances, where instructors\nwere brought to campus. Recently they had a hair show and a\nfamily movie day for the youth. Dream Realized through\nEducation/Empowerment and Mentoring (DREAM) was a group\nthat was part of JTS that also offers group activities to youth on\ncampus. Heart Warmers was a spiritual group that youth could\n4",
    "participate in on Sundays. Rights Officer confirmed that all of\nthese groups remain active on campus.\nQuality Manager was contacted via email on 1/23/25 regarding\nthe plans to revamp services on campus. Quality Manager\nreported there was a work group developed by the Activities &\nAcademic Support Manager. The work group was reviewing\ncurrent activities and creating new programming activities to\nengage the youth. Previously the facility contracted with outside\npartners for activities. There was also a restructured client\nadvisory board, similar to a student council, to provide youth with\nmore of a voice in decisions that were made. Youth would be able\nto bring any issues, concerns, wishes, requests to the group for\ndiscussion and decision making.\nActivities & Academic Support Manager (AASM) was contacted\nvia email on 1/23/25. AASM outlined the following items available\nto youth on campus: afterschool activities include but are not\nlimited to, expressive therapies such as yoga, dance movement\ntherapy, music therapy, art therapy, physical activity and\nnutritional health education. Academic mentoring and tutoring are\nsupported through the DREAM program as it connects each youth\nwith mentors who are successful in their career paths and provide\nsupports by focusing on their education and future career goals. In\naddition, the activity team provides programing that creates a safe\nenvironment to strengthen coping skills, promote social\nconnections, and support healthy self-esteem and confidence\nthrough creative self-care strategies. Lastly, the Transition to\nIndependence Process (TIP) model, supports the youth in areas\nof education, employment, social skills, relationships and health,\nand life skills.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nStaff 1 reported the youth engaged in activities such as dance,\nmusic, drawing, crossword puzzles, and some organized group\nactivities. Staff 1 stated some youth chose not to participate in\nactivities. Some youth were also not able to participate due to\nbehavioral issues. Staff 1 stated that police were called to the\nfacility if youth were having constant dangerous behaviors that\ncould not be redirected. When youth were angry or frustrated, staff\nwould talk to them and do things to get their mind off the problem.\nHowever, when youth were in ‘attack mode’, self-harming,\nattacking/injuring people, destroying property to harm others, and\ncould not be deescalated, the police were called. The police\nsometimes transported youth to the hospital to be evaluated when\nthey were self-harming, having suicidal thoughts, or injuring\n5",
    "themselves or others. The decision to call the police was made by\na supervisor or team leader. Staff then followed the police to the\nhospital to sit with the youth while they were evaluated.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nStaff 2 noted she was a new employee. Staff 2 stated youth\nattended school, had group, completed chores, and watched tv or\ndid other activities. Group mostly consisted of the youth getting\ntogether to talk about issues. Sometimes they would color or do\nworksheets. Staff 2 did not observed youth to have time outside,\nother than using the outdoor courtyard. Staff 2 did not go to the\ngym with youth. Police could be called to the unit if a youth was\nviolent and attacking staff. Before the police were called, staff\nworked to keep the youth safe by removing items, talking to the\nyouth, calling for additional staff assistance, and trying to calm the\nyouth. If a supervisor or team leader decided the police needed to\nbe involved, they would make the call. Police typically took the\nyouth to the hospital if they were self-harming, attacking someone,\nor had injuries. Staff followed the police to the hospital to sit with\nthe youth.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 1\nreported youth participated in therapy 1-2 times per week. Youth\nalso attended group therapy, expressive therapies, recreational\ntherapy through JTS. JTS includes STEM activities, mentoring\nand educational tutoring. Youth also received occupational\ntherapy, psychiatric, medical, and family engagement services.\nWhile on their unit youth were able to play games, participate in\nart, watch television, and participate in groups. Regarding police\nor hospital involvement, their services could be needed if a youth\nwas highly escalated to an extent that it was a safety concern, and\nthey are unable to regulate themselves or be deescalated.\nSometimes physical intervention could be used, but that was not\nalways safe, especially with a youth that was self-harming or\nphysically aggressive. The unit manager, clinical director or head\nconsulting psychiatrist made the determination if youth should be\nsent to the hospital. Therapist 1 stated the facility began working\nwith Wayne County Community Mental Health to complete\nassessments at the facility rather than visiting the hospital.\nTherapist 1 has not had any experience with this service at this\ntime.\nTherapist 2 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 2\nreported that youth were offered activities such as games, art,\ngym, dance class, and cooking class. Therapist 2 believed youth\nindicated they were not doing as many activities lately due to\n6",
    "some programs being revamped. Some activities could also be\nrestricted if the youth was physically aggressive. For example,\ninstead of using colored pencils that may be sharp, a youth could\nbe given crayons to draw. In addition to activities, youth also\nattended individual and family therapy, and occupational therapy.\nIn therapy they worked on triggers and warning signs, coping\nskills, thinking/feeling, and discuss problem solving. Regarding\nhospitalization and police contact, Therapist 2 reported that youth\ncould be escorted to the hospital by police if they had continued\nescalated physical aggression, self-harming, or suicidal behavior\nthat staff are unable to reduce after multiple attempts to help the\nyouth self-regulate. The clinical supervisor and clinical director\nmust make the determination if assistance is to be called.\nTherapist 2 also reported that the facility began a partnership with\nWayne County CMH, where CMH staff will complete on-site\nassessments to determine if a youth was eligible for short term\nhospitalization.\nTherapist 3 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 3\nreported that youth at the facility were offered therapy, psychiatrist\nappointments, occupational therapy, DREAM, life skills, leadership\nskills, and afterschool activities such as sports, art, and dance.\nYouth attended therapy twice per week on a flexible schedule that\nworks best for the youth. Regarding police and hospital services,\nyouth were sent to the hospital when there was a suicide attempt\nor AWOL. Youth may also be sent if they were highly aggressive\ntoward others, and staff have been unsuccessful at calming them\ndown. The police may be called to safely escort youth to the\nhospital upon approval by the clinical supervisor and director.\nTherapist 3 noted the facility was also working with Wayne County\nCMH, as they would go on site to complete assessments for\nyouth, rather than sending the youth to the hospital.\nTherapist 4 was interviewed by phone on 1/24/25. Therapist 4\nstated that youth on campus participated in individual therapy,\ngroup work, JTS activities, DREAM program, Alcoholics\nAnonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, structured activities with\nvolunteer groups, occupational therapy, religious services, and\nreceive support from youth counselors. JTS had pro-social life\nskills, games, yoga, dance, sports and art. DREAM offered life\nskills, vocational training, exercise and mentorship. On the unit,\nyouth were able to participate in art, games, movies, crafts,\nactivities in the courtyard, and go on outings in the community.\nThese activities may be modified at times, due to youth behavioral\nor safety issues. Therapist 4 stated youth received at least one\nhour of therapy per week, which may be broken up into smaller\n7",
    "sessions, depending on the youth. Regarding police or hospital\ninvolvement, Therapist 4 stated police may be called to campus if\nyouth had violent behaviors and attacked staff or peers. Police\nwould not be called until after staff made several efforts to\ndeescalate the youth. A supervisor, clinical director and the\npsychiatrist would determine when police would be called to\ncampus. Generally, this decision was made when a youth needed\nto be evaluated, but staff did not feel they could safely transport\nthe youth. Therapist 4 stated that she had some experience with\nthe new process of having Wayne County Community Mental\nHealth complete an assessment on-site, in lieu of going to the\nhospital. The assessment was well done and determined the\nyouth needed inpatient hospitalization. However, there was not a\nplacement available. The service was helpful, but not as helpful as\nthey hoped.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Vista Maria Program Statement updated 3/22/2024: Direct\nProgram Services: “weekly individual therapy, monthly\nfamily and group therapy, sensory integration approaches,\nexpressive therapies, group counseling focused on\nintervention, non-violent crisis interventions approaches,\ncommunity outings, daily recreation, after-school activities,\nnursing services, mentoring, life skills education, family\nvisitation and phone call opportunities, transportation to\nhome visits when appropriate, family engagement events,\nand aftercare services for six months after discharge.\nContracted services include on-campus education,\npsychiatric and psychological evaluations, medical, optical,\nand dental examinations.”\n• “Youth log of daily expectations”: Staff must indicate if\nyouth met expected behavior standards for the following\nactivities: social skills, peer interaction, school/study time,\npersonal care, group participation, recreation participation,\nroom care/chores, healthy eating, appropriate dress,\neffective coping skills, safe behavior/transport.\n• ‘Emergency Psychiatric Care” policy dated July 2014.\n• If client is in imminent danger of harming herself or\nothers, supervisor/team leader/staff contacts 911.\n• If the situation is serious but there is no imminent\ndanger, arrange for staff or private ambulance\ntransport to appropriate psychiatric crisis\nassessment center.\n• Staff should not transport an uncontrollable client.

However, Youth A,\nYouth B, Youth C, Youth D, Staff 1 and Staff 2 reported that\nactivities did not always occur. Youth and staff indicated there was\nincreased acting out behavior when activities did not occur, or\nwhen youth were placed on wing restriction from activities. Youth\nand staff reported concerns that the agency’s behavior\nmanagement/reward system was not effective. Youth and staff\nreported concerns that staff spend too much time deescalating\ncertain youth and therefore not completing activities with other\nyouth.\nDuring interviews Youth A and Staff 2 reported youth do not have\nopportunities to participate in outdoor activities.\nActivities & Academic Support Manager provided\ndocumentation of several indoor activities made available for\nyouth. However, no outdoor activities were identified.\nDuring a call on 2/6/25, Chief Administrator and Quality\nManager reported that youth participate in outdoor activity when\nthe weather permits. However, they were unsure if there was a\nschedule of outdoor activities. They were asked to provide\ndocumentation to show that youth were participating in outdoor\nactivity on a regular basis. In subsequent emails on 2/10/25 and\n10",
    "2/14/25, Quality Manager reported they did not have any\ndocumentation to verify this request.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nWeekly and monthly unit schedules were reviewed that had\nschedule activities documented such as daily group, daily phone\ncalls, therapy, physical activity, JTS, “Chicktime” with volunteer\ngroup, Vista Maria reads (Book Ladies), Lost Voices Concert,\ntown hall meeting, Boots & Bites with Lace Up Detroit, Pet\nTherapy, holiday events with Abhi Shah Foundation, holiday\ndecorating, and youth health fair.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as youth reported being\nunable to participate in activities due to peer behavior, or not\nhaving any activities available to them while on wing restriction.\nYouth also reported they are not able to engage in outdoor activity\nand the agency did not have any documentation to verify outdoor\nactivities occur with youth.\nCONSULTATION:\nConsultation was provided regarding staff consistency. Youth\nreported that some staff engage with youth more than others. Staff\nengagement with youth should be consistent and ongoing. A daily\nschedule and occasional monitoring by supervisors may help\naddress this concern. Consultation was offered regarding youth\nbehavior on units that disrupt the daily activities. When disruptive\nbehavior is ongoing and prohibiting other youth from their daily\nactivities, efforts should be made to continue activities with youth\nin another area, away from the disruption. Not only would this be a\npositive step for the other youth, but it would also take away the\nacting out youth’s power to control the daily activity of the unit.\nAdditionally, for youth placed on restriction that are missing\nactivities, staff should continue to focus on encouraging the youth\nto reduce behaviors in order to re-join the group. This may help\nalleviate the youth’s feeling that wing restriction is never ending.\nLastly, inclusion of ideas from some restricted youth in the client\nadvisory board would be a great way to determine some activities\nthat restricted youth may be interested in, to help them increase\nengagement in the program.\nConclusion Violation Established\n11",
