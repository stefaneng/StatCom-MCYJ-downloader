    "Rule Code Staff responsibilities.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation Allegation 1\nThe child has special needs and was evaluated via Sprout, the\nagency's worker did not obtain a copy of that evaluation report or\na copy of the child's neurological report and the therapy reports.\nAllegation 2\nThe agency worker did not inform the child's Day Care provider\nthat the child is a temporary court ward. Due to that failure one\nday the facility released the child to the birth mother who is not\napproved for unsupervised visits with the child.\nInvestigation Allegation 1\nInterviews\nComplainant\nOne 8/2/2024 I interviewed Complainant by telephone.\nComplainant affirmed the allegations in the complaint and\nindicated clarifications. Complainant reported Child A’s prior\nplacement agency did not get Child A’s April 2024 Sprout Early\nOn report and Child A’s current case worker, Foster Care Worker\n(FCW), failed to obtain a copy of that report for this special needs\nchild. She reported the Sprout evaluation indicated a neurological\nwas needed, and FCW did not follow up on that. She reported\nChild A (age 3) only had the neurological exam that was just prior\nto his placement with his father, Parent C. Complainant reported\nChild A’s placement with Parent C is one the GAL (Guardian Ad\nLitem) is in disagreement with and is appealing the court’s\ndecision on. Complainant reported FCW said she requested the\nSprout report and was told she needed a subpoena to get the\nreport. Complainant reported she is not sure when FCW would\nhave made that request. Complainant reported nor did FCW send\nChild A’s mother, Parent B’s, therapist reports to the GAL and\n2",
    "Court for review and FCW was not drug testing Parent B. She\nreported the GAL does not have the neurological or therapist\nreports for Parent B, who is the one in therapy.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FSC)\nOn 8/7/2024, I interviewed FCS by telephone. FSC reported in\nAugust of 2023, the court dismissed the case against Parent C\nand placed Child A in Parent C’s custody. FCS said when the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services- Oakland County\n(DHHS-OC) sends the court report and other supporting\ndocuments to the Court they also copy those to the GAL, Parent\nB’s attorney, and the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney (APA). She\nreported reports were obtained for Parent B and sent to the Court\nfor the July 2024 court hearing. She reported the therapeutic\nprogress report for Parent B have been provided to the GAL, and\nthe Court for each review court hearing. She reported drug\nscreen results for Parent B have also been provided. FCS\nreported she actually submitted the documents for the court\nhearing in July 2024, and she sent them to the GAL. She said two\nemails were sent to the Court and copied to the other parties. One\nemail contained the court report and the other email the social file\nwith the therapy reports and drug testing. FCS reported only the\nGAL has complained about not getting these reports. She\nprovided me a copy of emails sent to the stated parties showing\nthe submissions.\nFCS did not provide details related to Child A’s Sprout evaluation\nreport and or neurology report. She reported FCW had worked on\nthose and would have obtained or provided the information\navailable.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 8/23/2024 I interviewed FCW by telephone. FCW said the\nSprout evaluation was over a year ago and completed when Child\nA was placed via Wolverine and prior to Child A’s direct placement\nwith DHHS-OC. She reported not having a copy of that evaluative\nreport and trying to obtain a copy from Parent C. She did not\nobtain a copy from Wolverine but reported discussing the\nevaluation outcome with the Wolverine worker. FCW reported the\nGAL never requested a copy of this report, nor reported she did\nnot have it. The GAL just asked whether she had reviewed the\nSprout report. FCW indicated she shared what she had obtained\nabout the outcome of the Sprout evaluation from the Wolverine\nworker with the Court, and GAL at the court hearing. She said the\nCourt did not have a problem with that, only the GAL. She said\nshe reviewed Child A’s last neurological report, which was related\n3",
    "to his first appointment and that was also dated over a year ago.\nThe neurologist who authored the neurological report dismissed\nChild A from further treatment. She said the Court did not have a\nconcern with her reporting on that matter either. She said the\nGAL mentioned Child A’s behavior of head banging and she\nshared Child A has not had that behavior since the prior two\nincidents in foster care, and the one at school last year. She said\nthe GAL’s concern was that FCW didn’t have the original report\nand that the report which FCW received via text from\nGrandmother had not yet been uploaded to MISACWIS.\nFCW reported when she received the case from Wolverine that\nagency was following up on a referral related to the neurological\nand the agency sent her the original report, and the last report,\nwhich was the same and was for termination of any further\ntreatment. FCW said everything that was recommended, speech\ntherapy, special education she followed up on. She reported Child\nA received those services. She said Parent C wanted additional\nspeech therapy and that is pending for Parent C to follow up on.\nFCW reported having and providing Parent B’s therapy progress\nreports and drug screens to the Court, GAL and others via email\non 7/5/2024, as an attachment with a court report. She also sent\ndocuments to the GAL on 6/18/2024. She provided me copy of\nthose emails which was the same provided by FCS.\nDocuments Reviewed\nChild A MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• He entered care and was made a temporary court ward on\n1/13/2021. He was placed in an unlicensed relative home\nand two prior foster homes before his placement with\nParent C on 8/11/2023.\n• A copy of a neurological report dated 10/10/2023 that\nindicated it was for Child A, a new patient. This document\ndenoted it was a” Final Report”. That the diagnosis was\nexpressive language disorder. It indicated no concern for\nAutism based on Parent C and Grandmother reporting and\ntheir indication of a past evaluation. Additionally, this\nneurological indicated no concern for the reported injury to\nChild A’s forehead at that time and there was no concern\nfor sequala (after affect disease). The recommendation was\nfor Parent C to follow through with the additional speech\ntherapy Parent C indicated wanting.\nEmails of reports sent to the Court, GAL and others dated\n4/2/2024; for a 4/3/2024 court hearing; 6/18/2024 for a 6/24/2024\n4",
    "court hearing; and 6/27/2024 and 7/5/2025 for a 7/8/2024 court\nhearing and which showed:\n• The court report for the respective court dates.\n• Copies of October and November 2023 drug screens for\nParent B along with therapy progress reports for Parent B\nfrom 1/8/2024 to 3/27/2024 attached with the 4/3/2024\ncourt report.\n• Copy of a 1/24/2024-4/22/2024 updated service plan\nattached to the 7/5/2024 court report along with therapy\nprogress report for Parent B from 4/4/2024 to 6/20/2024;\nand June 2024 drugs screens for Parent B. The 6/27/2024\nemail showed the court report for the 7/8/2024 court\nhearing was sent to the Court and GAL on 6/27/2024.\nAllegation 2\nInterviews\nComplainant\nOn 8/2/2024 I interviewed Complainant by telephone.\nComplainant affirmed the information indicated in the complaint\nalleging Child A’s temporary wardship status not being reported to\nChild A’s Day Care Center (DCC). She reported the DCC was\nunder the impression Child A was placed in Parent C’s mother’s\ncustody. She reported because of the lack of reporting by the\nagency, one day in May or June of 2024, the DCC released Child\nA to Parent B. Complainant reported this is a problem, because\nParent B does not have approval for unsupervised visits with Child\nA.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS).\nOn 8/7/2024, I interviewed FCS by telephone. FCS said their\nagency, DHHS-OC (Department of Health and Human Services-\nOakland County) had made the DCC aware of Child A’s\ntemporary warship legal status. She said FCW had gone to the\nDCC several times to pick up Child A, and so, the DCC knew\nChild A was under the supervision of the department. FCS\nadmitted it may be likely there is not documentation showing those\ncontacts by FCW with the DCC.\nFCS reported with regards to the alleged incident, they learned\nabout the incident one to two weeks after its June 2024\noccurrence. The GAL mentioned it at the July 2024 court hearing.\nFCS reported what was explained is that Parent B went to the\nDCC to retrieve Child A and the DCC called Grandmother (Parent\nC’s mother and backup care provider) related to whether to\nrelease the child to Parent B. Grandmother told the DCC it was\n5",
    "okay to release Child A to Parent B, that Parent C was in the car.\nThe DCC staff did not check the car to verify Parent C’s presence.\nNor did they contact DHHS-OC. FCS reported it turned out the\nperson in the car with Parent B was a friend of Parent B’s not\nParent C. FCS was not sure why Grandmother had not reported\nthe truth. She thought Grandmother may not have known that was\nnot the truth at that time. FCS said the GAL had not reported this\nconcern to the agency prior to the July court hearing. She said\nonce the agency was made aware of this incident, FCW\naddressed the matter with the DCC the next day by going to the\nDCC. FCW advised the DCC they are not to release Child A to\nParent B or any unapproved person. FCW also addressed the\nissue with Parent C and Grandmother. FCS reported Parent C\nhad been doing welling caring for Child A.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 8/23/2024 I interviewed FCW by telephone. FCW reported it\nwas true Child A was released to Parent B by the DCC, but not\nbecause they did not know Child A was in foster care. She said\nthe DCC reported not reaching out to FCW when they released\nChild A to Parent B because FCW was not listed on the DCC’s\nemergency contact list. FCW could not explain why the DCC\nwould not have had her information available on file. She was also\nnot sure whether there was a copy of a school /day care letter/\ndocument on file that the agency would have provided to the DCC\nrelated to Child A being in foster care. She said she had\npreviously provided her information to the DCC and so had Parent\nC. She said she provided the DCC office worker another one of\nher business cards. She also reiterated to them they need to\ncontact her if they are leery or unsure about releasing Child A to a\nParent/ Person, if they are unable to reach Parent C or\nGrandmother.\nDocuments Reviewed\nChild A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• Previously reported information about his placement and\nwardship.\n• A prior Wolverine educational placement form for Child A at\na prior Day Care only- not one for this DCC\n• A 3/12/2024 social work contact showing FCW picked Child\nA up from the DCC and transported him to a parent/child\nvisit.\nAnalysis Allegation 1:\nBased on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence does\nnot show that the agency did not obtain the child’s neurological\n6",
    "report or did not provide the birth mother’s drug screens and\ntherapy reports to the GAL. Nor that the agency did not work\ndirectly with the children, their families, and other relevant\nindividuals related to the development, implementation of the\nservice plan.\nAllegation 2\nBased on interviews and documents reviewed there is insufficient\nevidence to show the agency had not been in contact with the\nDCC related to Child A being in foster care. Social work contact\nshowed FCW picking up and transporting the child from the DCC.\nNor does the evidence show that the agency did not work directly\nwith the children, their families, and other relevant individuals\nrelated to the development, implementation of the service plan.\nTechnical Assistance\nThe agency is apprised submitting an official form letter to the\nDCC which contains Child A’s name, other relevant information\nand the FCW’s/ agency’s contact information on that form that can\nbe filed in the Child A’s DCC record and a copy placed in the child\nMISACWIS would prove beneficial in this instance.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family time for\nDescription each child in foster care consistent with the child's service plans,\nas required by R 400.12419 and R 400.12420 to ensure the safety\nand well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency allowed the child's birth father a convicted felon and\ndrug user to be the designee to supervise the birth mother's\nparenting times with the child. Additionally, the worker has not\nobtained documentation about the visits from the birth father.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nOn 8/2/2024 I interviewed Complainant by telephone.\nComplainant affirmed the allegations as indicated in the complaint.\nShe reported the agency had been allowing Parent C to supervise\n7",
    "Parent B’s parent/child visit since some time starting in April 2024.\nThe Complainant reported FCW admitted this at a court hearing.\nComplainant expressed concern that due to Parent C’s criminal\nand drug history, as well as Parent B’s drug history that Parent C\nshould not be the parent/child visitation designee. Complainant did\nnot indicate whether there was a prior court order indicating\nParent C, who has placement of Child A could not be the person\nto supervise Parent B’s visits with Child A. Complainant\nresponded that at the last court hearing in July 2024, the Court put\nin the court order that Parent C cannot be the designee for the\nparent/child visits.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS).\nOn 8/7/2024, I interviewed FCS by telephone. FCS confirmed it\nwas correct that Parent C has a past criminal conviction and drug\nuse history. She reported the Court was aware of that past history\nand approved Child A’s placement with Parent C notwithstanding\nthose past issues. She reported it was also true that Parent C was\nsupervising Parent B’s visitation with Child A in the home. She\nreported this occurred after a court hearing in April 2024 where\nthe Court indicated parent/child visitation could be by DHHS or by\nDesignee. FCS said she and FCW discussed the matter and\nthought that supervision was doable. That since the Court felt that\nParent C was safe for Child A to be placed with, the agency\nthought Parent C providing the parent/child visitation supervision\nwould not be a problem. FCS reported they thought it was okay\nsince Grandmother was also a designee to supervise the\nparent/child visits. FCS said Parent C had been taking proper care\nof Child A and prior to the GAL bringing the matter up at this last\ncourt hearing, the Court had not objected to Parent C being the\ndesignee for visits. The Court had previously indicated they\ntrusted DHHS-OC’s discretion. FCS said at the hearing in July\n2024 the GAL did not want Parent C as the designee and the\nCourt indicated Parent C cannot be the designee. They are\nabiding by that court order.\nFCS reported Parent C reports about the visits have been slow\nand sporadic. She reported FCW has all the parenting times\nentered in MISACWIS for June 2023 and FCW is entering July’s\nvisitation now. She said Parent B may visit Child A two-to-three\ntimes a week and the visitation outcomes they have would be in\nthe court reports.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\n8",
    "On 8/23/2024 I interviewed FCW by telephone. FCW affirmed\ninformation as reported by FCS. She also admitted that there was\ncommunication issues with Parent C related to obtaining\ninformation from him on the outcome of the visitation between\nParent B and Child A. FCW said she reported this concern to the\nCourt at the June 2024 court hearing. FCW reported she did not\nterminate Parent C from being the parent/child visitation designee\nrelated to his repeated delays in providing her information about\nthose visits because, though she had to track him down, at times,\nshe was getting some things from Parent C later to update her.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nA copy of a court order from a 4/3/2024 court hearing that\nindicated:\n• Child A is to remain in Parent C’s home.\n• Supervised parenting time for Parent B by the agency or\ndesignee. The order did not clarify who could be a\ndesignee.\n• A copy of court reports for 6/24/2024 and 7/8/2024\nrespective court hearings which indicated to the Court\nParent B’s parent/child visits with Child A were being\nsupervised by Parent C, with Grandmother as a backup.\nA copy of a 7/8/2024 court order that denoted:\n• Parenting time shall be supervised by MDHHS or it’s\ndesignee and that Parent C cannot be that designee.\nChild A’s MISACWIS file which showed:\n• Parent/child visitation between Parent B and Child A at\nParent C’s home documented from 4/18/2024 to 7/23/2024\nwith some parent/child visits occurring three or more times\nwithin the month.\n• Extremely limited information or details about the\nparent/child visitations, with a number of parent/child\nvisitation outcomes not being entered in MISACWIS for\nover three weeks up to two months or more after the date\nof the parent/child visitation. Details about the outcome of\nthe worker’s regular monthly home visits were also\nfrequently not described/documented.\nAnalysis Notwithstanding whether Parent C was appropriate to be the\nparent/child designee, based on interviews and documents\nreviewed, the evidence did not show the agency was in violation\nof the court’s order related to that aspect of the allegation.\n9",
    "As it relates to the FCW obtaining documentation about the\nparent/child visits from the birth father, the evidence showed this\nhas not been timely, consistent, or promptly documented as would\nrelate to the rule of ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the child.\nConclusion Violation Established.\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection (2) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster child, and\nDescription the foster parent, if applicable, in the child's placement at least\nonce every month.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The worker admitted at the review hearing that she has not had\nface to face contact with the birth father, who has placement of the\nchild, in weeks.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nOn 8/2/2024 I interviewed Complainant by telephone.\nComplainant reported at the court hearing on 7/8/2024, FCW said\nshe had not seen Child A and Parent C in weeks.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS).\nOn 8/7/2024, I interviewed FCS by telephone. FCS reported the\nvisitation requirements have always been that the worker was to\nsee the child and the child’s father/caregiver monthly and that is\nwhat FCW has been doing. She reported following the 7/8/2024\ncourt hearing where the court ordered twice monthly contacts,\nFCW has not missed a home visit to Parent C’s home.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 8/23/2024 I interviewed FCW by telephone. She denied the\nallegation. She said she has not missed a single monthly home\nvisit. She admitted there had been at least one time that she has\ngone out and Parent C was not there, and she completed the visit\nwith Grandmother and Child A.\nReviewed\nChild A’s MISACWIS file which showed:\n10",
    "• Consistent monthly home visits to Parent C’s home with\nhim and Child A from January 2024 to August 2024 as\nrequired.\nAnalysis The evidence does not support the allegation of no face- to face\ncontact by FCW with Parent C and Child A in weeks or at least\nonce monthly as required by the rule.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nAs a result of the findings in this investigation, a corrective action plan is required.\nNovember 7, 2024\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 8, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n11"
