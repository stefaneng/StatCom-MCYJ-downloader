    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the individual CAP is as follows: The agency\nsubmitted one acceptable corrective action plan in response to the renewal\ninspection completed 4/3/2023 with a corrective action plan approved on 4/5/2023.\nDuring the review period the agency had three violations. They were CPA Rules\n400. 12509 3 (n), 400.12509 3 (o) and FOM Policy 801-03 Medical Passport.\nDuring this reporting period under review, the agency did not have any repeat\nviolations and contributed their success to following their corrective action plan\nfrom their last inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) and this Consultant discussed the Chief\nAdministrator Assessment (CAA) while onsite on 3/7/2024. The barrier the CA\ndiscussed were the high number of placement crises over the past review period.\nThe high number of placement crises added to the job stressors and somewhat\nimpacted the ability to comply with the licensing rules. The CA reported the\nagency has restructured positions by separating the dual position of case manager\nand house supervisor to allow time for case managers to focus on managing\ncases alone and not supervising independent living direct care staff. The CA\nreported a Program Manager was hired to supervise the direct care staff. The CA\nprovided a review of the corrective action plan for the renewal evaluation\ncompleted on 4/3/23 and an assessment of the key performance indicators.\nThe CA expressed confidence that several areas will improve over the next review\nperiod.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency Independent Auditors’ Report dated 9/30/22 and the annual financial\nbudget report were reviewed. No financial concerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed all reported receiving the supervision and support needed to\nlearn and complete their job responsibilities. No concerns were reported.\n4",

Files and CHRI are stored securely in a manner that prevent\nunauthorized access within metal locked cabinets and drawers and behind locked\ndoors.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nN/A\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n04/08/2024\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/10/2024\nSamanatha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
