INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Employee records.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4113\nSection (1) An institution shall maintain employee records for each\nDescription employee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of human\nservices, the equivalent state or Canadian provincial agency, or\nequivalent agency in the country where the person usually\nresides, that the person has not been determined to be a\nperpetrator of child abuse or child neglect. The documentation\nshall be completed not more than 30 days prior to the start of\nemployment and every 12 months thereafter.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There are concerns regarding non approved facility staff\nresponding to incident.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplaint Source for this investigation is DCWL from reviewing\nrestraint reports from the facility.\nChief Administrator was interviewed face to face at the facility\non March 26, 2024. Chief Administrator reported a Code Green Call\nincludes staff from all over the hospital to respond to support an\nincident on the unit. He reported when a Code Green needs to be\ncalled, the hospital staff respond including nurses, staff on other\nunits, and security. Chief Administrator reported he was present\nduring the exit interview for the investigation (2024C0000996SI) that\nprovided technical assistance that any Pine Rest staff working with\nthe Lotus Treatment Program youth in any capacity, including\nemergency response, must meet all the requirements for a child\ncaring institution staff. He reported Director was setting up meetings\nto figure out how to be in compliance with utilizing hospital staff for\nsupport. Chief Administrator reported he believed those meetings\nwere occurring.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 26,\n2024. Youth A reported she has never been hurt in a restraint but\nnoted she does not like it when male staff restrain her. She reported\nin one restraint, a male staff switched out with a female Security\nGuard which helped her calm down. Youth A reported staff will\nsometimes call a Code Green which means staff need extra support\nfrom other hospital staff with a youth. She reported that was how\nSecurity Guard got involved with one of the restraints.\n2",
    "Youth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 26,\n2024. Youth B reported sometimes staff will call a Code Green which\nhas more staff from the hospital help on the unit.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 26,\n2024. Staff 1 reported she is a shift supervisor. She reported one of\nher roles is to help support units when they need extra assistance,\nsuch as when a youth is escalated. Staff 1 reported some of the\nincidents can be handled by just Lotus staff but if there is a situation\nthat cannot be handled then a Code Green can be called. She\nreported a Code Green has hospital staff from other inpatient units,\nnursing, and security come for additional support. When asked about\nthe restraint that occurred on March 5, 2024, with Youth A, she\nconfirmed Security Guard did switch out with a male staff because\nYouth A was not responding well to having a male staff.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 26,\n2024. Staff 2 reported a Code Green call is made when the Lotus\nstaff need additional support to the unit when a youth is a danger to\nthemselves or others. She reported the additional support that comes\nare hospital staff from other units, nursing, and security guards. Staff\n2 reported a Code Green was called on March 14, 2024, when she\nwas in a restraint with Youth A, she was assaulted by Youth C and\nadditional support was needed.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on March 28, 2024. Staff 3\nreported she has been working as a float staff at the Lotus Program.\nShe reported sometimes float staff will float between units to help\nwhen there are escalated behaviors. Staff 3 reported a float staff is\nnot always on the schedule as it depends on where they are with\nratio and needs of the youth. She reported if there is ever a concern\nthat the unit is understaffed, management will come in and work as a\ndirect care staff to provide support. Staff 3 reported she was involved\nin the March 14,2024 incident with Youth A where they called the\nCode Green and people from the hospital came to provide support.\nLicensing Consultant was interviewed via phone on March 27,\n2024. Licensing Consultant reported she completed special\ninvestigation report 2024C0000996SI. She reported she held a virtual\nTEAM exit meeting with Chief Administrator and Director on January\n23, 2024. Within that exit meeting technical assistance was provided\nfor the Code Green policy that Pine Rest staff working with the Lotus\nTreatment Program youth in any capacity, including the emergency\nresponse, must meet all requirements for a child caring institution\nstaff. Licensing Consultant reported she stated those Pine Rest Staff\nresponding to the Code Green must also be within the annual\nemployee roster for the annual audits. She reported staff at Pine\n3",
    "Rest cannot just respond and handle a situation at Lotus unless they\nmeet the Child Caring Institution (CCI) rules for staff working at CCI.\nLicensing Consultant reported she made several suggestions\nincluding cross train all Pine Rest staff and meet licensing rules for all\nthose staff or designate a smaller number of specific Pine Rest staff\nto be cross trained and meet licensing rules to respond in crisis.\nLicensing Consultant reported Director had some concerns with this\nand the number of people that would need to be cross trained.\nDirector reported to Licensing Consultant that she was going to meet\nwith upper management that following Thursday about a plan and\npotentially would reach back out to the licensing department. She\nreported she told Director and Chief Administrator that this needed to\nbe addressed as this is a licensing rule. She stated that she told\nthem that technical assistance is being provided to give them the\nchance to change but if it comes up again that someone is working\nwithin the Lotus Program that is not within the licensing rules then it\nwould be a citation.\nDirector was interviewed face to face at the facility on April 3,\n2024. Director was present when this consultant was reviewing\nhuman resource files of the staff involved with the restraints. She\nreported she was aware of the technical assistance that provided in\nthe prior investigation and stated she had discussions with upper\nmanagement about the concerns from state licensing. Director\nreported she was not given a time frame of when the correction\nneeded to be fixed. Director reported all staff that work in the hospital\nprograms and the Lotus program complete their background checks\nby fingerprinting. She reported the hospital staff are never left alone\nwith the youth in the CCI. Director reported the security staff and\nLotus staff do complete all the required abuse and neglect\nclearances but the staff that work in the hospital do not.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n- Special Investigation Report 2024C0000996SI dated\nJanuary 17, 2024- Licensing Consultant completed this\ninvestigation.

This report was\nconsistent with Staff 1’s interview. The report notes, “The\nrestraint was released due to another peer assaulting (Staff\n2), and the Jade pod had minimal staff at the time so staff\nholding (Youth A) down attempted to pull other peer from Staff\n2 while waiting for hospital staff to arrive after Code Green\nbutton was pushed.” The following staff were involved with\nthis restraint: Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3\n- MiSACWIS Report 177310230- This restraint report\ndescribed the second restraint of Youth A on March 14, 2024.\nThis report followed MiSACWIS Report 177310229.

The following staff were involved with this\nrestraint: Staff 11, Staff 12, Staff 13, Staff 14, Staff 15, Staff\n16 and Nurse 1.\n- Code Green/Emergency Assistance Policy dated June\n2023- This policy notes that staff will determine the necessity\nof initiating a Code Green/ Emergency Assistance call. A\nCode Green is a signal to other Pine Rest Staff that additional\nassistance is needed in the area. The procedure section\nnotes, “When all staff present in the Lotus program are unable\nto contain a situation that is unsafe, a Code Green may be\ncalled.” This policy does not note who specifically comes from\nPine Rest Staff to help with the Lotus Program.\n- Lotus Program- Staff to Resident Ratio Policy dated June\n2023- This policy states during waking hours there is a\nminimum of one staff to four youth at the facility. For the\nMarch 14, 2024, incident there was four youth on the unit with\ntwo staff working.\n- Email from Director dated March 27, 2024- Director provide\nthis consultant the location of the staff works within Pine Rest\nthat were involved in the restraints on March 5, 3024, March\n14, 2024, and March 17, 2024.

Through reviewing human\nresource files out of the nineteen staff that were involved in restraints\nfourteen of them did not have central registry clearances completed.\nTechnical Assistance\nTechnical Assistance is offered to consider a smaller portion of Pine\nRest Hospital staff be identified that can respond to crisis with the\nLotus Treatment Program, decreasing the number of staff that would\nneed to have central registry checks, training and references\nobtained as the agency noted it would be cumbersome to have all\nPine Rest hospital staff meet the licensing rules. Additionally, DCWL\nsuggested considering submitting a variance request for references\nrequirements and number of training hours for the Pine Rest hospital\nstaff that typically do not work within the program.\nConsultation\nConsultation was offered to the facility regarding staff completing\nincident reports as they are documenting that there is a lack of staff\nor minimal staff, although the staff are within ratio of the unit. In\nfuture documentation instead of stating lack or minimal staff, be clear\nadditional staff were needed so not to suggest the program did not\nhave a sufficient number of staff working.\nConclusion Violation Established\n6",
