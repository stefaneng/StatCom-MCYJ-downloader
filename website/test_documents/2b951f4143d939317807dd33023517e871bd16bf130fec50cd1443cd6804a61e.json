    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\nSection • (1) An agency's medical and dental care policy must,\nDescription include all the following:\n• (b) The provision of emergency medical, surgical,\nand dental care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency has not maintained appropriate communication with\nfoster family and requests have gone unanswered regarding\nmedical needs. The agency failed to obtain medical consent timely\ncausing surgery to be rescheduled for a youth in care.\nInvestigation Foster Parent was interviewed on 1/7/25 via telephone.\nSubsequently to discussing the original allegation, Foster Parent\nhad the following concerns about Foster Child A, Foster Child B,\nand their biological father only. Foster Child A and Foster Child B\nare siblings and are placed in the home of Foster Parent.\nFoster Child A and Foster Child B are temporary court wards with\nthe permanency goal of returning home with their biological father.\nFoster Child A and Foster Child B’s Biological Mother’s rights\nwere terminated on 2/10/25. However, Biological Father’s rights\nare not terminated, and he is following the treatment plan to\nreunite with Foster Child A and Foster Child B.\nFoster Parent reported the agency is unresponsive to requests\nregarding monitoring Foster Child A and Foster Child B’s medical\nneeds during their unsupervised visits with Biological Father.\nFoster Parent gave the example that when Foster Child A and\nFoster Child B returns to her home from the unsupervised visits\nwith Biological Father, they are constipated. Foster Parent did not\naccuse Biological Father of doing anything to cause Foster Child\nA and Foster Child B to be constipated. She said this is her\nobservation when Foster Child A and Foster Child B returns from\nthe unsupervised visits with Biological Father. Foster Parent\nreported Foster Child A is taking a psychotropic medication that\nhe should take daily. Foster Parent reported she does not believe\nFoster Child A’s Biological Father is giving the medication to\nFoster Child A when he is having unsupervised visits on the\nweekends. Foster Parent did not explain how she knows that\nBiological Father is not giving Foster Child A his psychotropic\nmedication while on his unsupervised overnight visits. This is an\nassumption of Foster Parent.\n2",
    "Foster Parent reported concerns on Foster Child C, that the\nagency failed to obtain medical consent timely causing surgery to\nbe rescheduled for Foster Child C. She reported Foster Child C\nhad a medical appointment on 6/27/24 and the doctor reported\nFoster Child C to have enlarged tonsils and recommended\nTonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy. She reported the agency has\nnot obtained surgical consent for Foster Child C in a timely\nmanner. Foster Parent said Foster Child C’s first scheduled\nsurgery was cancelled due to the agency failing to gain consent in\ntime and the surgery had to be rescheduled. The surgery was\nscheduled in November of 2024 but was canceled due to not\nhaving surgical consent from Foster Child C’s Biological Mother.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed on 2/27/25 and\n3/4/25 via TEAMS and telephone. She reported she discusses\nany concerns every Monday with Foster Parent regarding the\nunsupervised visits between Foster Child A, Foster Child B with\nBiological Father. CA reported Foster Parent suggested that staff\nfrom her agency go to Biological Father’s home on the weekend to\nmonitor the interactions between Foster Child A, Foster Child B\nand Biological Father. CA reported she directed the assigned\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) to make a home visit to Biological\nFather’s home and monitor the interactions of the unsupervised\nvisits. FCW went to Biological Father’s home the weekend of\n12/21/24 to observe interactions between Foster Child A and\nFoster Child B and Biological Father. CA said FCW observed\nFoster Child A, Foster Child B and Biological Father engaging in\nactivities (games) with one another, eating snacks, laughing,\nplaying together. There was no safety concerns noted. CA\nreported FCW did not observe Biological Father give Foster Child\nA his medications as the medications are provided to Foster Child\nA in the mornings and FCW went to the home in the middle of the\nafternoon. CA said FCW reported Biological Father said he did\ngive Foster Child A his medication that morning when FCW asked\nhim if he did provide Foster Child A his medication that morning.\nCA reported the same information as FCW (noted below)\nregarding Foster Child C’s surgery. Foster Child C’s surgery went\nwell, and he has no complications from the surgery that was\ncompleted on 1/13/25.\n3",
    "Foster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed on 2/27/25 and\n3/5/25 via telephone. FCW reported Biological Father is against\nadministering medication to Foster Child A and Foster Child B and\ndoes not believe in medication, however, FCW said Foster Child A\nis on a psychotropic medication and the agency filed a medical\npetition against Biological Father and this was granted by the\ncourt judge. Therefore, Biological Father will administer all of\nFoster Child A’s medication to him when Foster Child A began his\novernight visits the week of 11/13/24.\nFCW reported she provided a medication log to Biological Father\non 12/21/24, to ensure Foster Child A is receiving his medications\nduring overnight visits. She reported she will review the log\nmonthly and discuss medications with Biological Father on a\nmonthly basis. She said she will also ask Foster Child A if he is\ntaking his medications when he is with Biological Father. FCW did\nnot observe Biological Father administer the medication to Foster\nChild A when she went to the home for a wellbeing check on the\nweekend of 12/21/24 but did ask if Biological Father was giving\nFoster Child A his medications and he said yes, he was giving\nFoster Child A his medications.\nFCW reported Foster Child B is currently not on any prescribed\nmedication. Foster Child B is in the process of getting a full\nevaluation for Attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). No\ndate has been set for this evaluation.\nFCW reported Foster Child A and Foster Child B’s immunization\nwaiver conversation started in early October 2024 with Biological\nFather. She said Foster Parent informed the agency on 10/1/24\nthat the waiver was expiring, and a new one would need to be\nobtained. FCW said on 10/3/24, Biological Father informed FCW\nhe called for an appointment, but the health department was\nbooked until December of 2024. FCW said the appointment was\nset for 12/18/24. Biological Father informed FCW when he called\nfor the appointment, he was told by the Macomb Health\nDepartment that the waiver was still active, and nothing needed to\nbe completed right away.\nFCW said she called the Macomb Health Department on 12/20/24\nand was informed that biological father did not attend the\nscheduled appointment. She said she called biological father on\n12/30/24 about what she had learned and gave him until the end\nof the day on 12/30/24 to obtain a new date for the appointment.\nOn 12/30/24 Biological Father called FCW and stated he spoke\nwith the Macomb Health Department on 12/18/24 and the worker\n4",
    "there said the current waiver was active and to call back after the\nNew Year.\nFCW said Biological Father called FCW on 1/2/25, to ask\nquestions regarding the waiver. FCW said she informed Biological\nFather on 1/2/25, that the waiver was not completed properly.\nFCW said Biological Father was directed by Macomb County\nHealth Department to go to Wayne County Health Department to\nget the waiver rectified. FCW said Biological Father called her and\ninformed her that he would be going to the Wayne County Health\nDepartment before 3pm on 1/3/25. FCW said on 1/6/25, she\nasked Biological Father for a copy of the waiver. She said he sent\nthe waiver to her on 1/6/25, and the document was dated 1/3/25.\nFCW said she forwarded the waiver to Foster Parent on 1/6/25.\nFCW reported Foster Child C became a permanent ward on\n2/10/25, and Foster Parent was able to obtain Foster Child C’s\norders for medications and parent consent which makes things\neasier for her in dealing with Foster Child C’s medical issues.\nFCW explained Foster Child C’s surgery was delayed because the\nagency had to obtain surgical consent from Biological Mother and\nduring that time when Foster Parent discussed the\nrecommendation from the doctor on 6/27/24, Biological Mother\nwas not available and could not be found as she was MIA. FCW\nreported Biological Mother would not respond to text messages or\ntelephone calls. She reported Biological Mother’s last\ncommunication was in April 2024 when she stated it was not in the\nbest interest of Foster Child A, Foster Child B or Foster Child C to\nsee her.\nFCW reported when Foster Child C was taken to the doctor and\nthe doctor recommended Foster Child C needed his tonsil and\nadenoids remove on 6/27/24, the doctor was unaware that Foster\nChild C was in foster care and Foster Parent was not his biological\nmother. Therefore, surgical consent had to be obtained by Foster\nChild C’s Biological Mother. FCW reported her rights were not\nterminated during this time and Biological Mother had to be\nlocated to obtain the consent and this took some time. When she\nwas located in January 2025, she wanted additional information to\nmake sure this surgery was necessary. FCW said Biological\nMother signed the consent paperwork in January 2025. FCW said\nwhen the doctor received Foster Child C’s paperwork in January\n2025, it took some time for the doctor to schedule an appointment\nfor the surgery for Foster Child C which made for additional\ndelays. She said it was explained to Foster Parent that these\nmatters do take time. FCW said paperwork was submitted to the\n5",
    "doctor 1/8/25 and the surgery was scheduled for 1/13/25. FCW\nexplained this surgery was not routine nor an emergency but a\nplanned procedure therefore, the consent had to come from\nBiological Mother. Part of the delay of getting the surgery\nscheduled was discussing the surgery with the doctor’s surgery\ncoordinator and finding a time for Foster Child C’s surgery to take\nplace and/or be scheduled.\nFCW reported that Foster Child C’s surgery went well, and he has\nno complications from the surgery that was completed on 1/13/25.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed on 3/4/25 via\nTEAMS. FCS provided some history of the siblings placed in\nFoster Parent’s home. She reported Foster Parent has three\nchildren placed in her home, Foster Child A, Foster Child B and\nFoster Child C, who are siblings with the same mother and\ndifferent fathers. She reported similar information as CA and\nFCW. She added that Foster Parent is not on board with the\npermanency plan of Foster Child A and Foster Child B.\nShe reported she talks with Foster Parent daily about anything\nshe wants to discuss regarding medical needs, behaviors and\nBiological Father. FCS reports Foster Parent is not happy about\nthe possibility of Foster Child A, Foster Child B returning home\nwith Biological Father. She said Foster Child C’s parental rights\nfrom Biological Mother was terminated on 2/10/25 and Foster\nChild C’s father’s rights were terminated on 2/10/25. FCS\nreported Foster Child C is in the process of being adopted by\nFoster Parent and that Foster Parent would like to keep Foster\nChild A, Foster Child B and Foster Child C together and in her\nhome as she has really bonded with the siblings, and she enjoys\nhaving them in her home.\nFCS reported the same information as FCW regarding Foster\nChild C’s surgery. Foster Child C’s surgery went well, and he has\nno complications from the surgery that was completed on 1/13/25.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Foster Child A, Foster Child B and Foster Child C’s Case\nrecords were reviewed:\n• Foster Child A is prescribed the psychotropic medication\ndexmethylphenidate, albuterol and cetirizine.\n• Foster Child B is not taking any medication; however, he is\nin the process of being scheduled for a full evaluation for\nattention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n6",
    "• Foster Child C is prescribed four psychotropic medications.\nclonidine, oxcarbazepine, methylphenidates and\natomoxetine. The three siblings were placed in the home\nof the Foster Parent from 6/13/17 – 3/4/20. They returned\nto bio mother from 3/4/20 – 6/2/20 then returned back to\nFoster Parent from 9/22/21 to present.\n• Updated services plan dated 1/9/24 – 4/5/24 recommended\nthat Foster Child A and Foster Child B remain Temporary\nCourt wards in their current placement with the\npermanency goal of reunification with their biological father.\nVisitation began in the biological father’s home on 4/6/24.\n• Agency policy on medical, surgical and dental care states,\nall children in care who are in need of emergency medical\nand surgical care, a written consent is to be obtained from\nthe legal guardian and/or parent.\n• Court report dated 11/13/24, states biological father is\noffered weekly unsupervised overnight visits on Saturday\nand Sunday’s and family therapy bi-weekly on Thursdays\nfor his sons, Foster Child A and Foster Child B. Bio\nmother’s rights are terminated for all three brothers, Foster\nChild A, Foster Child B and Foster Child C.\n• Documentation was reviewed and confirmed the\nmedication log, (Photos) that is sent to the FCW monthly\nfrom Biological Father for review regarding administering\nmedications to Foster Child A during unsupervised visits.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted with the agency staff, there were\nsome delays with getting an immunization wavier timely as well as\nscheduling a surgical procedure for Foster Child C. However, the\nagency staff had to work with other agencies, the agencies system\nas well as locate the biological mother of Foster Child C to get her\nconsent for Foster Child C’s surgery to schedule the surgical\nprocedure. These steps were time consuming, and the agency\nappeared to be working and communicating with Foster Parent\ndaily. Immunization waivers and surgical procedure presented in\nOctober of 2024 were resolved. The medical procedure of Foster\nChild C was completed in January of 2025.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n7",
