    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff qualifications\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Incident 1\nWhen working, Former Staff 1 allowed Youth T to touch her\nbuttocks and breast.\nIncident 2\nStaff 2 gave Youth T a Breeze vape.\nIncident 3\nUnidentified staff drink alcohol at work.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI was assigned this investigation on 4/2/24. Complainant is\nanonymous. In addition to allegations in this report, Complainant\nalleged other possible licensing rule violations that were already\naddressed in SIRs 2024SIC0001233, 2024SIC0001278 and\n2024SIC0001286. Any activities that occurred or may have\noccurred outside of the licensed facility were not investigated as\nthese are outside the scope of DCWL.\nINCIDENT 1\nI contacted Youth T’s Foster Care Worker on 4/3/24 and notified\nher of the investigation assignment. She did not know Youth T’s\nwhereabouts and had no additional licensing concerns to report.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator (CA) via phone on 4/3/24\nregarding Former Staff 1’s employment history. She said Former\nStaff 1 had only worked with youths for two weeks before she was\nplaced on administrative leave on 3/21/24 for possibly giving\nYouth T her phone number and address. CA said she was unable\nto determine if or how this happened, but officially terminated her\non 3/27/24 based on the staff’s “at-will” status at Wolverine\nCenter. CA denied witnessing Former Staff 1 allow Youth T to\ntouch her sexually. But when Youth T AWOLed on 3/25/24, she\n2",
    "gave police the former staff’s phone number and address in case\nthey wanted to follow up.\nInitially Youth T could not be interviewed as he had AWOLed on\n3/25/24 and his whereabouts were unknown.\nOn 4/3/24, Youth T was located and temporarily detained by the\nOak Park Police. According to Government Worker 1, Youth T\ncontacted police requesting help as he was in a hotel room\npurchased by Former Staff 1. Police arrested Former Staff 1 on\nan outstanding warrant and later charged her with Third-Degree\nCriminal Sexual Conduct.\nOn 4/4/24 Government Worker 1 (in-person) and I (via conference\ncall) interviewed Youth T while he was at the police station. He\nsaid he AWOLed from Wolverine Center on 3/25/24 and went to\nFormer Staff 1’s home in Warren. He stayed there until 3/31/24 or\n4/1/24 at which time Former Staff 1 “put him in the car and drove\nhim to a hotel on 8 Mile Rd.” Asked why the former staff took him\nto a hotel, Youth T stated, “Because the police were circling her\nhouse.”\nYouth T said he called the police from the hotel on 4/3/24 because\n“uncomfortable stuff happened, and he didn’t like it.” I asked him\nif “uncomfortable stuff” between he and Former Staff 1 also\nhappened inside Wolverine Center while she was working. Youth\nT answered “Yes” but said he did not tell anyone at the facility\nwhat happened.\nOn 4/4/24 Youth T was released from police custody to Foster\nCare Worker who transported him to a residential facility on the\nwestside of the state.\nWhile I was out of the office, a forensic interview of Youth T was\nheld at Voices on 4/18/24. Government Worker 1 observed the\ninterview and reported the following pertaining to Wolverine\nCenter:\nYouth T told the forensic interviewer that Former Staff 1 touched\nhis buttocks inside the facility outside of his clothes. He would\nnot say how he got Former Staff 1’s phone number, and said he\ngot her address by looking at the outside of her house.\nFormer Staff 1 could not be reached by phone. On 4/24/24\nGovernment Worker 1 attempted to interview Former Staff 1 on\nthe porch of her residence. She said Former Staff 1 screamed at\n3",
    "her that “nothing happened” and reluctantly accepted Government\nWorker 1’s business card. The former staff told Government\nWorker 1 that her attorney would be contacting her and slammed\nthe door.\nI interviewed Youth Z jointly with Government Worker 1. He\ndenied witnessing anything unusual happened between Former\nStaff 1 and Youth T but said he heard a rumor “they were doing\nsomething strange.”\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker 1 via\nphone. He has worked at the facility for 22 years. On a date he\ncould not recall, Supervisor remembered he sent Former Staff 1\nhome “because Youth T was acting real strange when he was not\nallowed to have her as a staff.” Asked why he sent her home,\nSupervisor responded “I felt it was not safe for her…I didn’t see\nher do anything, but Youth T was talking about harming people.”\nAsked how Former Staff 1 reacted to being sent home, Supervisor\nsaid “She asked me why and I told her it was unsafe. I don’t think\nshe felt good about it. Later I saw her standing outside (the\nfacility) across the street and thought it was strange when I had\nasked her to go home.”\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. She\nwas a direct care worker for eight months and then promoted to\nsupervisor in September 2023. Asked about Former Staff 1,\nSupervisor 2 stated “I didn’t get a good feeling from her. Former\nStaff 1’s feelings were unprofessional. I’d pull her (away) and\nshe’d somehow find her way back to Youth T. Her sense of\nconcern for him was too personal. She told me he had feelings for\nher. I never saw her do anything except be in his presence. I\nstressed to her the importance of keeping her distance. When\nYouth T AWOLed he (allegedly) told an unidentified staff that he\nwas going to Former Staff 1’s house…She only worked here for\nmaybe three weeks. She had poor boundaries.”\nINCIDENT 2\nWhen interviewed Youth T said it was not Staff 2, but it was Staff\n3 who gave him “vapes, weed buds, liquids and oils…free. I’d\nkeep it on my body or in my room. Once the vape dropped out of\nmy pocket and Supervisor and Supervisor 2 let me keep it. They\nasked for it but then let me keep it because I was about to be\ngrown.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has\nworked at the facility for five months. He denied giving Youth T\n4",
    "illicit substance or paraphernalia and denied seeing any other staff\ngive him this. Staff 2 did however, see Youth T drop a vape in the\nfacility. Before staff could confiscate it, he said “Youth T picked it\nup, ran outdoors and hid it somewhere.” Staff 2 said he saw\nYouth T vaping while he was off the premises without permission\n(AWOL status). “He probably hid it outside and then picked it up,”\nStaff 2 hypothesized.\nStaff 3 arrived at the facility 45 minutes late for his scheduled\ninterview. I interviewed him jointly with Government Worker 1 via\nphone. Staff 3 has worked at the facility for five months. He\ndenied giving Youth T illicit substances or paraphernalia and\ndenied seeing any other staff give him this. “When I saw Youth T,\nhe was always going to bed,” he remarked.\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker 1 by\nphone. He denied seeing or having any knowledge about Staff 2\nor any other staff giving Youth T vapes. If he did, he said he\nwould report that staff. Supervisor denied ever seeing Youth T\ndrop a vape inside of the facility. “I never saw Youth T vaping\noutside, but I heard he does when he AWOLs.”\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. She\nrecalled a vape incident pertaining to Youth T outside of the gym.\nSupervisor 2 denied allowing Youth T to keep a vape. “Absolutely\nnot,” she said. “It (vape) was discarded (in the office trash).\nINCIDENT 3\nInterviews:\nYouth T, Youth N and Youth Z denied knowledge that staff drink\nalcohol at work.\nSupervisor, Supervisor 2, Staff 2 and Staff 3 denied knowledge of\nany staff drinking alcohol at work.\nAnalysis Youth T AWOLed on 3/25/24 and went to Former Staff 1’s house\nwhere sexual contact occurred between the two. Police charged\nFormer Staff 1 with Criminal Sexual Conduct and Government\nWorker 1 deemed her unsuitable to work with children.\nFormer Staff 1 had only worked with youths at Wolverine Center\nfor about two weeks before Supervisors noticed she had an\nunusual affinity toward Youth T. Later on 4/18/24 Youth T told a\nforensic interviewer that Former Staff 1 touched his buttocks\noutside of his clothes inside the facility. However, there are no\nknown witnesses and Former Staff 1 denied anything happened.\n5",
    "Wolverine Center staff were proactive and acted immediately to\nprevent harm to Youth T and others inside the facility. Supervisor\n2 reassigned her away from Youth T, Supervisor noticed Youth T\nacting “strange” and sent Former Staff 1 home and CA placed her\non administrative leave on 3/21/24 and provided her address to\npolice ultimately assisting in her arrest.\nWhile it is now clear that Former Staff 1 lacked the ability to\nperform the duties of her assigned position, aside from poor\nboundaries, no one witnessed her allow Youth T to touch her\nbuttocks or breast or saw her touch his buttocks inside the facility.\nDue to facility staff noticing Former Staff 1’s suspicious behaviors\nand intervening and CA responding proactively, harm to children\nat the facility was prevented. Therefore, a citation against\nWolverine Center and a corrective action plan are not required.\n(Violation Not Established)\nThere is no evidence to support that Staff 2 or any other staff gave\nYouth T a vape.\n(Violation Not Established)\nThere is no evidence that staff drink alcohol at work.\n(Violation Not Established)\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Sufficiency of staff.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youths access drugs and alcohol in the facility.\n6",
    "Investigation Interviews:\nYouth T said he and Youth Z smoked vapes in the facility\ntogether. He denied drinking alcohol or seeing any other youths\ndrink alcohol.\nYouth Z denied smoking vapes inside the facility with Youth T and\nthat youth access drugs and/or alcohol in the facility.\nYouth N denied youths have access to drugs or alcohol inside of\nthe facility.\nStaff 2, Supervisor and Supervisor 2 denied youth have access to\ndrugs or alcohol inside of the facility.\nAnalysis There is no evidence youths access drugs or alcohol inside the\nfacility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\nApril 30, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 8, 2024\n_______________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n7"
