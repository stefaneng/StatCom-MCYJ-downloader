    "Administrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n4/16/24 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Administrator\nreported Staff 1 did not complete aftercare services for youth, so\nthere would be no reason for him to have contact with any youth\nafter they left the facility. Administrator reported he has never\nheard of Staff 1 mentoring any youth after they left the facility.\nAdministrator reported Staff 1 worked primarily in Donna Maria\nHall, which was part of the Vista Maria Specialty License.\nHowever, Donna Maria Hall was closed, and all the youth moved\nto Rose Hall around 10/15/2020.

Staff 1 reported he worked part-time at the\nfacility from late 2020-early 2021.

Staff 1 reported he\ndidn’t feel like there was any protection for him, and he didn’t want\nto take the chance of any other false claims coming forward\nbecause he had his own kids and family to think about.
