METHODOLOGY\n04/08/2020 Special Investigation Intake\n2020C0207027\n04/08/2020 Special Investigation Initiated - Letter\nEmail confirmation sent to agency Director regarding investigation\nopening.\n04/08/2020 Contact - Document Received\nMiSACWIS review of case information.\n04/09/2020 Contact - Document Sent\nEmails exchanged with Director.\n04/20/2020 Contact - Document Sent\nEmails exchanged with the Director.\n04/20/2020 Contact – Document Sent\nEmails exchanged with the DHHS Specialist.\n04/21/2020 Contact - Telephone call made\nInterview with Worker completed via phone due to COVID 19.\n08/10/2020 Exit Conference\nEmails exchanged with Director.\nALLEGATION:\nAgency did not follow policy on face to face for the first month of care using\nallowable alternatives to verify child's safe sleep environment and practice.\nINVESTIGATION:\nIt is notable that contacts began with the notification of the child's death on 04/02/20\nby the Director. Information was later received from Office of Family Advocate (OFA)\n2",
    "which prompted the investigation begin opened on 04/08/20. The OFA report noted\nthat Foster Child A died in the relative placement and DHHS ‘determined that\ncontrary to court orders, the mother had spent the night in the home, was caring for\nthe children, and had placed the children in an unsafe sleep situation.’ The report\nalso noted that the agency had not documented a second face to face visit in the\nfirst month of placement.\nI received notification of Foster Child A’s death on 04/02/20 and spoke with the\nDirector on 04/03/20. The Director reported, and documentation confirmed, that\nproper notifications were made per licensing rules. The Director stated that the\nrelative assessment was completed and the relatives “said all the right things” and\nwere approved. The Director did identify that the foster care worker did not complete\nthe two required face to face visits in the first 30 days of placement. This was\napparently missed as the case changed from one foster care worker (no longer\nemployed with the agency) to the current Worker, coupled with the in-person contact\nrestrictions due to COVID 19 at the time. Per the Director, Foster Child A was\nreportedly just over two months old and was noted to be healthy for a premature\nbaby who was born exposed to substances. The mother was at the unlicensed\nrelative home overnight on the night the child died and was not supposed to have\nunsupervised visits. The relatives apparently allowed her in the home unbeknownst\nto the agency. There is a DHHS Specialist and law enforcement assigned to\ninvestigate the mother on this case, not the agency staff.\nI interviewed the Worker on 04/12/20 via phone. The Worker reported that the\nprevious worker left the agency but had been on emergency leave prior, and not all\ndocumentation was up to date when she got the case. The Worker said that there\nwas “quite a delay” in scheduling a visit as the relative did not answer her calls for\nabout a week and she was not able to leave a voice message every time. This\nrelative does not use text messaging per the Worker. The Worker went on to say\nthat, on 03/10/20, she set an appointment for a home visit for 03/12/20, but due to\nCOVID 19 precautions and restrictions on face to face contacts that subsequently\nwere released, she changed the in-person home visit to a phone call with the\nrelatives. The Worker stated that she spoke with both relatives during the call and\nneither said that the mother was in the home or had been in the home. The Worker\nsaid that when she asked about parental visits with the mother, the relatives stated\nthat visits are “suspended” due to COVID 19, but they were doing Facetime calls\nwith the mother and babies. The Worker said she was advised by the relative that\nthe mother was living with another relative and made it clear she was not there. The\nWorker stated that she reviewed with the relatives the visit guidelines as well as safe\nsleep. The Worker noted that she had not received a response to her reaching out to\nthe mother in her time with the case.\nMiSACWIS review of relevant case information found the following:\n Child placed in the relative home 02/14/20\n Social work contacts noted:\no Face to face visit by the previous worker on 02/24/20.\n3",
    "o Phone only visit/FTM on 03/12/20 by the Worker due to COVID 19.\no Notification received by Worker from law enforcement of Foster Child\nA’s death on 04/02/20. The mother was in the relative’s home and told\npolice she knew she was not supposed to have unsupervised contact.\nThe relatives also reportedly told the officer they were aware of the\nrequired supervised visits.\nAPPLICABLE POLICY\nFOM 722-06H CASE CONTACTS\nCHILD IN OUT-OF-HOME PLACEMENT\nThe primary caseworker must have face-to-face contact with\neach child as indicated below.\nFirst Two Months after Initial Placement or a Placement Change\n The caseworker must have at least two face-to-face\ncontacts per month with each child in the first two months\nfollowing an initial placement or a placement change.\n The first face-to-face contact must take place within five\nbusiness days of the date of removal or placement\nchange.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation of the policy as the worker did not\nhave an initial face to face contact in the first five business days\nof the placement or have two in the first month of placement.\nThe child was placed in the home on 02/14/20 and the worker\nfirst saw the child on 02/24/20. Another visit was not planned to\noccur until 03/12/20. The Director and Worker acknowledged\nthis. A safety plan was not required as twin to Foster Child A\nand the other sibling in the home were moved to another\nrelative’s home for care and supervision.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRenewal Inspection Report, 09/27/19 and Corresponding\nCAP received 10/11/19.\nThe agency must report why the previous CAP failed and\nhow they are going to ensure compliance.\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the agency submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nAugust 10, 2020\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 11, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
