It was noted when youth were asked where staff were,\nStaff 1 came out of the consumer unit bathroom and Staff 2 came out of the staff\nunit bathroom.\n Resident Supervision Guideline- This policy states staff at DART main job\nexpectation is supervision of residents. It notes in the milieu staff will have\nresidents in their line of sight at all time. It also states if the youth walk down the\nhallway staff are to position themselves to be able to see all youth.
