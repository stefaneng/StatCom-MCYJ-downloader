The\nassessment documented that the agency has been in compliance during its 6-\nmonth original status. No areas of concern were noted. The facility has been\nsuccessful in obtaining a RFCAN contract during this review period. The\nassessment also indicated an appropriate plan for continued monitoring of\ncompliance.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nTwo staff, one supervisor and two administrators were interviewed during the\nassessment.

Both youths were\ninterviewed for the audit. One youth reported to be doing very well in the program\nand feels that the structure of the program along with the encouragement of the\nstaff has been very beneficial for her. The second youth reported not feeling as if\nthe program was beneficial and admits to struggling to remain. Youth has\nAWOLed before but was safely returned to the facility. The concerns and the\nstruggles of the youth were appropriately shared with the facility.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through was completed. The agency was found to be well maintained and\nappropriately staffed.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
