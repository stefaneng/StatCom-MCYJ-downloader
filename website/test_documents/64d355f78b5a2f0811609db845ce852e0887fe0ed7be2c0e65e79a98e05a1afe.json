    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nSection The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth I and another unidentified youth allegedly had sexual\ncontact in a bathroom at the facility between 3/24/23 - 8/31/23.\nInvestigation I reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI notified Complainant who is also Youth I’s Foster Care Worker\nof this investigation assignment. She expressed no concerns\nabout the facility.\nFormer Youth I is currently placed with Foster Parent. I\ncontacted Youth I’s Foster Parent who was aware of the\nallegation. She gave me permission to interview Youth I via\nphone.\nI notified Rights Officer of the allegation and arrived at the facility\nunannounced on 9/6/23. Rights Officer advised me that while at\nVista Maria, Former Youth I identified as a transgender male and\npreferred he/him pronouns. However, to his knowledge, Youth I\nhas not “come out” to his current Foster Parent and prefers to the\npronouns she/her in the foster home. I requested any incident\nreports involving Former Youth I and another youth in the\nbathroom and/or any reports involving both Former Youth I and\nYouth A. Rights Officer searched Vista Maria’s data system and\nthere are no incidents.\nI interviewed Former Youth I, age 12, and asked if she had\nconcerns about anything that happened at Vista Maria. She said,\n“No.” I told her someone reported she and another youth had\nsexual contact in a bathroom at Vista Maria. She sounded\nsurprised and responded, “What? No. I never said I had sex in a\nbathroom. I don’t know where you’re getting that from.” I asked\nFormer Youth I if she was ever inside a bathroom with another\nyouth. She said, “Once Youth A was upset so I went in there\n(bathroom) and talked to her. I’m kind of confused about who said\nthis…Youth A didn’t do anything. No. That didn’t happen.”\n2",
    "Former Youth I said she had no concerns relative to her stay at\nVista Maria.\nI interviewed Youth A, age 16. Youth A said she identifies as\nnon-binary and prefers they/them pronouns. I asked Youth A if\nthey knew Former Youth I and they were visibly concerned. I\nreassured them Former Youth I is “okay” and they appeared\nrelieved. I told Youth A that someone reported a concern that\nYouth I had sexual contact with another youth in a bathroom at\nVista Maria and mentioned their name. They appeared amused\nand stated, “No. That didn’t happen.” I asked Youth A about their\nrelationship with Former Youth I at Vista Maria. They described\nthem as “best friends” explaining, “He (Youth I) was like a younger\nbrother to me.”\nI asked Youth A if they were ever in the bathroom with Former\nYouth I. They said they may have been in the bathroom together\nbut were always supervised by staff. “Staff usually stand by the\ndoor looking inside.” I asked Youth A if Former Youth I ever told\nthem he had sexual contact with any other youths at Vista Maria\ninside or outside the bathroom. They replied, “No.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 with Rights Officer present. She has worked\nat Vista Maria for two years and was familiar with Youth A and\nFormer Youth I. Staff 1 said Youths A and I generally got along\nwell together and sometimes argued like siblings would. “They\nplayed with barbie dolls in Youth I’s dollhouse.” Staff 1 noticed\nnothing unusual or concerning about their relationship.\nAnalysis Evidence does not support the allegation that sexual contact\noccurred between Former Youth I and another unidentified youth\nat Vista Maria. Therefore, there were no issues identified\nregarding a lack of supervision by staff.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nSeptember 13, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 13, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
