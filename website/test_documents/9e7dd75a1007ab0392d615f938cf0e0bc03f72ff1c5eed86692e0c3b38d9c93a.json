CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nNo Consultation provided.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe agency submitted a corrective action plan for the renewal inspection dated\n10/4/2021 and the corrective action plan was accepted on 10/25/2021. The agency\nwas in noncompliance with rules 400.12312, Foster parent training, 400.12418,\nDevelopment of service plan and DHHS Policy 722.6B, Family team meeting.\nThe agency made progress with its corrective action plan. It was not completely\nsuccessful with all aspects of the plan, as indicated by the repeat citation reported in\nthis report. The agency reports their employees work diligently, and they continue\ntheir efforts to improve compliances.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS:\nThere were two safety alerts.\nConcern:\nThere is a bedroom in the basement that’s equipped with a set of bunk beds. The\nroom does not have a means of egress. A safety ladder is also recommended for\ntheir second story bedrooms.\nResolution:\nThe agency licensing worker spoke with the foster parent over the phone on\n10/11/22. The foster parent agreed to only use the room in the basement as\nstorage. The Licensing worker asked the foster parent to resign the agency\nbasement\nsafety plan. The safety plan and pictures of the before and after is attached to the\n4",
    "of safety alert.\nConcern:\nThe foster parents refused to comply with a home visit, therefore safety of the home\nand child (ren) could not be verified. A safety alert was submitted with a request for\nthe agency to verify safety of the children and the home. Current photos of the\nchildren were requested with the resolved alert.\nResolution:\nWorker completed the home visit with the foster parents on 9/23/2022 at\n12:45pm. The foster parent returned the children home early from day care. Upon\narrival, the children were eating lunch in their chairs and the foster parents reported\nthe children are doing well. The youth talked about their daycare, said they have a lot\nfun, and talked about one of their friends. The foster parents have also arranged for\nspeech therapy for the children to begin within the month. Both children sat next to\nthe worker on the couch after finishing their lunch and showed their shoes and\nnamed some colors. Both children were missing nap time, so they were a little tired.\nNo concerns were observed. The children are very comfortable with both foster\nparents. Photos was taken of the children. The home is appropriate for the\nchildren and there were no safety concerns observed. They had adequate child\nproofing, such as locks and gates on stairs. The foster home is in a residential\nneighborhood. The children have their room upstairs, and each have their own\nbed. They have highchairs in the living room where they eat some meals.\nRefer to the safety alert for photos\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nThe CAA was reviewed and discussed onsite. The Chief Administrator reported that\nshe and the program manager have met and summarized the primary barriers to\naddressing and fixing non-compliances. She said there was more remote working,\nturnover, increased expectations and little time to chase down MIA parents, given all\nthe documentation requirements. She said they incorporated several things,\nincluding making all caseworkers be in the office at least 12 hours a week to make\nsure they keep up with printing, scanning, uploading. They enlarged their leadership\nteam to create more support for the front-line workers. She said they have added a\nposition that includes community management which addresses staff morale and\ninvolves check-ins with newer staff and staff issues, so in addition to their supervisor\nthey have another person to vent to express issues or just get support.\nInterviews:\nProgram manager, licensing worker and foster care worker were interviewed onsite.\nThe staff reported that the agency has been steady but not as busy as before\nCOVID. They all love working for the agency and would not change much. One staff\nadded it would be great to get more support for the case aids to make them feel\nmore appreciated due to their job requirements of always transporting. Another staff\nreported it would be great to increase staff diversity.\n5",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy.
