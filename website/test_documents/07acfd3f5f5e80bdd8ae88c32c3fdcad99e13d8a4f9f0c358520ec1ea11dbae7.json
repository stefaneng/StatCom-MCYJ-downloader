    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe facility has submitted 13 acceptable corrective action plans (CAPS) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The\nreview period begins June 9, 2023, until current. The Agency was granted a 1st\nProvisional License on February 02, 2024, due to Special Investigation Report\n2023C0000787. Prior to Provisional License being granted, there were two\ninvestigations that resulted in a CAP which were due to supervision, improper\nrestraints, not documenting seclusion incident report documentation, and not\nobtaining medical care after a youth is restrained.\nSince the start of the 1st Provisional License on February 2, 2024, there have been\nfive investigations, 1 resulting in compliance, and three are pending investigations.\nThe 4 pending investigations:\n➢ 2024SIC0001352 Youth was assaulted by another resident, reported\nthe assault to staff and has not been kept safe.\n➢ 2024SIC0001483 On an unknown date while youth was at the facility, an\nunknown staff member assaulted the youth. Youth was not injured, and\nstaff member was terminated.\n➢ 2024SIC0001521 Youth was slammed against the wall by staff during\nan escalated incident.\n➢ 2024SIC0001559 A staff member left a door unsecured and youth were\nable to make entry and cause a fight with othe youth.\n➢\n➢ The facility was placed on a 1st Provisional License due to staff punching, choking,\nand pushing youth after youth threw urine at staff. The youth did not immediately\nreceive medical care after being assaulted by the staff. The agency did not provide\npositive intervention strategies to staff to secure safety and provide individual\ntreatment to the youth that was being bullied. The facility has implemented and\ncomplied with all their CAPs. They have been working on several active CAPs\nfrom the prior period and have completed some of them during this period. Areas\nof focus were proper restraint methods and use of verbal de-escalation, mandated\nreporting requirements, maintaining ratio, staff supervision, and following facility\npolicies. To address these issues, numerous staff trainings have occurred,\nmeetings are structured to address the issues and provide oversight, the quality\nassurance manager has been enlisted to provide additional oversight to various\nareas, and the new Director has provided increased structure, reinstituted\nprogramming, ensures follow through, and requires accountability. There is\nnotable improvement in oversight and accountability which has improved the\nprogramming and decreased complaints, restraints, and seclusions. They took\nappropriate steps by immediately putting staff involved on leave and terminating\nafter the investigations were completed. The facility has implemented coordinators\n(experienced workers) on all the pods that provides mentoring and coaching to\ndirect care staff throughout their shift. The managers and supervisors hold weekly\nmeetings with direct care staff and they provide supervision, review incident\nreports, provide training on any updated policy and procedures. The Chief",
    "Administrator reported some mandatory overtime continues when needed, but with\nthe weekly job fairs there are no reported issues with maintaining ratio.\n➢\n➢ Since being under a First Provisional License the facility completed biweekly\nonsite meetings with licensing consultant and complied with monthly unannounced\nvisits. The biweekly meetings started in September of 2023 and lasted until June\nof 2024. During these meetings, DCWL met with RCTAU and leadership at the\nfacility. These meetings consisted of review of CAP compliance and provide\nconsultation and technical assistance as needed. Staff and Youths were\ninterviewed during these visits. Youths consistently reported increased activities\nand use of the facility services, individual and group therapy, and positive\nengagement with staff and administration. The facility has the student council\nprogram for youths in which it provides an outlet for youths to express their\nconcerns.\n➢\nFinancial Overview\nThe financial report and budget were reviewed and showed no concerns.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nThe agency is complaint with PREA.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was thorough and identified new processes\nimplemented into staff training such as a shadowing form for new employees that\nhelps with identifying employee strengths and areas of additional training.\nExperienced staff (Coordinators) float the pods and provide support and mentor\ndirect care staff. Managers and Directors are watching live footage of all the pods\nto ensure staff are providing appropriate care and supervision. The facility is\ncontinually assessing methods to improve supporting existing and expanding\nrecruitment of new staff. The facility has weekly hiring fairs to ensure they have\nsufficient staff. The Chief Administrator reported over the past six months there\nhas been a significate reduction in investigation and the risk stratification score has\ndecreased. The facility has hired a licensed beautician onsite to cut and style all\nthe youths hair. The facility has improved in their implementation of CAPS and\ncompleted most of them from this period. The work and completion of these CAPS\nappears to have made a direct positive impact on the program as evidenced by the\nreduced number of investigations and violations in the past six months. They have\nalso actively participated with the Residential Collaboration and Technical\nAssistance Unit (RCTAU), and that has been reported as a successful and\nbeneficial partnership by both the RCTAU staff and the facility administration.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported feeling very supported, participating in monthly training,\nand feel the facility is meeting the needs of the youths. Youths interviewed\nreported feeling safe, receiving individual and group therapy, getting enough food,",
    "and all their needs are being met. Youths reported having positive relationships\nwith staff and expressed no concerns regarding the facility.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of the facility occurred on 06/14/2024\nobserved Pods, Gym, the youths' bedrooms, shower area, medication room,\ncontrol rooms, and classrooms. There were no issues or safety concerns noted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJuly 11, 2024\n__________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 15, 2024\n____________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
