    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• There was no consultation requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during\nthis period under review.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nindependent audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator documented there were no special investigations (during\nthis reporting period) nor licensing violations during the interim licensing inspection\nlast year. She also documents there have been no barriers or systemic factors that\nimpacted the facility’s ability to comply with licensing rules this reporting period. It\nis documented the facility has added a full-time therapist and lead specialist. It is\ndocumented the facility has added a Residential Services Coordinator to support\nthe direct care staff and supervision of the therapists will be conducted by the\nClinical Services Supervisor. It is documented these changes are not in response\nto any corrective action plan but rather an effort to build the structure of the\nprogram to support staff and youth in the program. The Chief Administrator\ndocuments the training of “Trust Based Relational Intervention” for all staff with\nplans to have this completed in October 2025. Two staff have been selected to\nbecome trainers so the facility can provide this training when needed and this\ntraining model is to help staff manage their reactions to the youth’s trauma\nreactions. The next step in this structure building is the implementation of the\nPower Source which is described as the “youth version of Emotional Intelligence\n(EQ2)”. The focus of staff trainings has been on staff recognizing trauma",
    "responses from youth which is based on the “EQ2” model which allows staff to\nmanage their stress responses to the youth’s trauma reactions. The action steps\nfor this training schedule are as follows:\n• All staff will participate in an EQ2 Group within the first 60 days of employment.\n• All staff will be trained in the basics of Trust Based Relational Interventions\n(TBRI) within 60 days of employment.\n• All staff will have access to the EQ2 app.\n• All staff will use the recognition feature on the EQ2 app to recognize peers for the\nuse of TBRI and EQ2 skills.\nThe Chief Administrator documents another factor at the facility is the decrease in\nstaff turnover. The Chief Administrator reports there have been 11 planned\ndischarges (11 total discharges) during this reporting period. She notes the\naverage length of stay for youth has been 94 days with an increase of discharges\ninto the community setting this past year. The Chief Administrator documents\nengaging the staff in wellness activities during the upcoming year. The facility has\nalso hired a Human Resources Business Partner position to assist the Operations\nDirector with human resources and hiring requirements.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed shared a report of a high investment in the youth doing well and\nappeared to use the best practices approach when dealing with the youth. Staff\nalso reported receiving significant training (EQ2 and TBRI) to help deal with\ntrauma issues the youth might present. Administration is also invested in the youth\ndoing well and report a strong effort to meet the different needs of the youth and\nprovide the staff with the best possible training and support.\nAll three of the youth in the program currently were interviewed. They reported\nfeeling safe at the facility and believed the program is beneficial to meet their\nneeds. All report receiving therapy session both individually and in a group setting.\nThey also reported a belief that the staff are invested in their wellbeing and are\nattentive to their needs.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThis is a single-story facility in excellent condition and very well maintained in all\naspects. There is a fully stocked kitchen, and all plumbing is in working order. The\ncleaning supplies are locked away from the youth. The medications are behind 2\nlocked doors and locked in cabinets in the medication room. Items requiring\nposting were found posted appropriately. Fire extinguishers were up to date and\nfire drills logs were also appropriate. Room check logs are documented as being\ncompleted appropriately.",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes. It is recommended that the agency be issued a renewal of their regular\nlicense.\n10/13/2025\n___________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/16/2025\n___________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
