    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Consultant spoke with Chief Administrator about the new electronic system for\nrecord keeping called WeCare. Technical assistance was provided to ensure\nfor case service plans the date of the report, date of the end of the report\nperiod, and date of the signature of the author of the report is the same date.\nCurrently in the system it can be viewed the date the report was submitted\nwhich aligns with the report date and end of reporting period date but the\nsignature date of the author of the report is not until full corrections are made\non the report. It should also be noted upon roll out of the system there was a\nglitch that the author of the report could not officially sign the report until the\nyouth signature was provided. This was corrected immediately as reports were\napproved in the system but could not be signed off on until the youth's\nsignature.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• During the time of the onsite visit, there was no consultation requested or\nrequired.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during\nthis period under review.\nThe review period begins February 27, 2025, until current. The agency was\ngranted a 1st Provisional License on February 27, 2025. The facility has had no\nspecial investigations during this period of review. Monthly unannounced visits to\nthe facility have been completed and weekly phone check-ins were completed with\nthe Chief Administrator and this consultant. The facility has been in compliance\nwith the implementation of their corrective action plans.",
    "The agency was placed on a 1st Provisional License as a result of special\ninvestigation 2025SIC0000061. The agency was successful in implementing the\ncorrective action plan that was approved from that investigation and the three\nother corrective action plans that were active during the 1st Provisional License.\nThe staff member that was involved in the physical altercation has since been\nterminated and not eligible for rehire. The staff members that were involved with\nthe concerns of supervision were either terminated or received coaching from their\nsupervisors. Since going onto a 1st Provisional License, the facility has made\nsignificant progress and improvements into the programs and safety of the youth.\nThe facility has implemented a classroom expectation form that notes the\nrequirements of the supervision of the youth within the classroom. This form has\nbeen trained on with all current staff and implemented into the new hire training\norientation. The facility has also implemented a new vehicle usage from/ travel log\nthat identifies staff and clients present for out of campus activities so the\nwhereabouts of the youth are always known by the staff. During the reporting\nperiod the facility implemented a robust training program where the leadership\nteam provided once a month training, (i.e.: supervision, power struggles, self-care\nplanning, team cultures/support) to address policy and procedure concerns that\nhave been areas of concerns from the investigations leading to the provisional\nlicense. There was also increased oversight during evening shifts with the campus\nwide supervisors doing evening check ins on units with staff and youth. The\nsupervisors implemented more emotional check-ins with staff, which staff have\nreported to be beneficial. All corrective action plans have been implemented and\nall action steps have been met in the required timeframes.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility’s\nbudget and the agency’s financial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator report was received on July 9, 2025. Chief Administrator notes\nthat there were no new special investigations during the first provisional review\nperiod. It is noted the facility continues to work towards getting their certification\nwith Sanctuary model and largely implemented trauma informed practices\nprovided by this model with an emphasis on emotional regulation/identification with\nsafety planning which is used for both the youth and staff. Chief Administrator\nwrote, \"Additionally the East Campus has had monthly training since the onset of\nthe provisional that addresses key concerns or areas of need to help develop our",
    "staff to deal with the complexities of the children we serve. These interventions are\nhelping to address the concerns that lead to the East Campus being on a\nprovisional license.\" The facility has implemented a residential administers\nmeeting at least twice a month to discuss concerns and to make collaborative\ndecisions regarding practices that impact this license and the organization at large.\nThe facility plans to continue these improvements even when the facility is off a\nprovisional license.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported well equipped to do their jobs. It was reported staff feel well\nsupported by their direct supervisors and teammates. Staff reported they have\nenjoyed the increased trainings that have occurred as a result of one of the\nprevious corrective action plans. Staff reported as a team they are still working on\nhaving clearer communication between shift changes but have noted that this has\nbeen improving over the past six months.\nYouth did not report any issues or concerns within interviews. They have reported\nhaving a positive relationship with at least one staff member and noted feeling safe\non the unit. Youth reported having a positive relationship with their assigned\ntherapist. Youth reported one thing they would change about the facility is to have\nincreased outings.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of the facility occurred on July 1, 2025.\nThere were no issues or safety concerns noted.",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes.
