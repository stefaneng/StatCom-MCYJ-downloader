    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4114 Tuberculosis screening for employees and volunteers.\nThe licensee shall document, prior to employment, that\neach employee and volunteer who has contact with\nresidents 4 or more hours per week for more than 2\nconsecutive weeks is free from communicable\ntuberculosis. Freedom from communicable tuberculosis\nshall be verified within the 1-year period before\nemployment and shall be verified every 1 year after the last\nverification or prior to the expiration of the current\nverification.\nOne of seven employee files reviewed (three long term and four under one year) did\nnot have the required annual verification of a TB test. The last TB test for this\nemployee occurred on 5/4/21 with this inspection taking place on 7/28/22.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThis facility is non-contracted with Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices therefore, MISEP requirements are not applicable.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract/Policy violation. Please\nnote that there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. This facility is non-contracted with Michigan Department of\nHealth and Human Services, therefore, MDHHS Policy/MDHHS contract are not\napplicable.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n The facility now has a compliance officer and we discussed a tracking form\nbeing developed.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n No consultation was provided or requested.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\n4",
    "The facility has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment or corporal punishment during this licensing period.\nThe first corrective action plan was in response to the 2021 Interim Licensing\nInspection. Four violations were found, and the facility submitted an approved CAP\n(8/4/21) for each. For the violation of missing information on the discharge plan, the\nfacility was to train all staff involved in the writing of the discharge plan. Each\ndischarge plan was also to be reviewed within 5 days of discharge by the compliance\nofficer. During this inspection, the compliance officer provided documentation that he\nhas completed this task and no violations were found within the discharge plans. The\nnext three violations all involved different aspects of facility and premises\nmaintenance. The first being damaged screens on windows that open, corroded\nshower heads in the bathrooms, and one of the two bathrooms having loose flooring\ntitles. The CAP for these issues involved the development of a “maintenance check\nlist” which overnight staff are to complete. This was documented as being completed\nand during this inspection, the repairs were observed to have been completed.\nThe second corrective action plan was in response to the special investigation\n2022C0328003 with an approved CAP on 1/18/22. This special investigation involved\nadditional findings that the facility failed to report a youth AWOL, as required, to the\nlicensing authority. The CAP for this finding involved the facility retraining all staff on\nthe procedure to be taken when a youth is AWOL The social services supervisor will\nfollow up within 12 hours to ensure that the correct action was taken with an AWOL\nyouth, and this will be documented in a case note. A follow up case note will also\nconfirm that all appropriate written action has taken place.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nThis report outlined the efforts and progress the facility made on the before\nmentioned corrective action plans. There were significant details to the efforts made\nand the addition of a “Compliance Officer” was noted. This new position has helped\nwith the compliance of their files. The facility identified the need to hire an outside\ntraining agency to provide more comprehensive and up to date training to staff. Pay\nraises have occurred and the facility continued to improve their “onboarding” process.\nInterviews:\nThere were no youth present in the program at the time of this inspection. It was\nreported the last youth in the program had left several days prior. Staff interviewed\nwere able to report the additional training and focus on AWOL youth. All understood\nthe procedure to follow. Staff reported feeling very supported by the administration\nand believe they are providing a positive and healthy service to youth. Administration\ninterviewed reported the positive changes that have been occurring due to the CAPs\nand present with a “best practice” focus.\n5",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that\nthe facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n8/8/2022\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n08/08/2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n6"
