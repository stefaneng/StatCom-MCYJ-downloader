INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints\nDescription (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the\nseverity of the youth's behavior, chronological and\ndevelopmental age, size, gender, physical condition,\nmedical condition, psychiatric condition, and personal\nhistory, including any history of trauma, and must be done\nin a manner consistent with the youth's treatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A and Youth B were not restrained appropriately on multiple\noccasions.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nThe Chief Administrator, Administrator 2 and Supervisor 1\nwere interviewed together on 07/18/2025. They shared case\nservice plan materials for Youth A as well as security camera\nfootage of restraint incidents. The Chief Administrator reported\nstaff at the facility had taken extra measures to attempt to\nunderstand how to work best with Youth A and avoid escalated\nphysical incidents, including having her separated from youth in\nunits and coming up with separate programming and daily\nschedules to best fit her needs. She provided documentation that\ndocumented a timeline of incidents and administrative actions for\nYouth A since she had been placed about a month prior. The\nChief Administrator described frequent meetings between\nadministration, direct care staff and supervisors, therapeutic staff\nand Youth A’s case management to best support her. She also\nreported that steps towards the possible placement of Youth A in\npsychiatric programs had occurred but was unsure if those\nplacements would be obtained or not.\nYouth A was interviewed on 07/18/2025 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. She confirmed she had been\nrestrained by staff on a frequent basis since her placement back\nat the facility in mid-June 2025. Youth A commented every time\nshe has been restrained, she felt like it was warranted because\nshe is “always acting up” and she intentionally tries to hurt other\nyouth and staff. Youth A believed staff members communicated\nwell prior to and during restraints, stating she knew when a\n2",
    "restraint was coming because staff would tell her. Youth A\nreiterated there was not a time she had been restrained she felt\nwas unwarranted because she would commonly start fights with\nother youth and staff.\nYouth B was interviewed on 07/18/2025 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled a specific instance\nwhen he was restrained by Staff 2 and Staff 3. Youth B recalled\nbeing upset and stating something about wanting to go down the\nhallway and fight other youth. He could not remember if he tried\nto walk in that direction or if he was standing still. He recalled\nballing up his fists and stating something threatening to the staff\nmembers. He recalled one of Staff 2 or Staff 3 stating “We are not\ngoing to keep doing this all day.” Youth B could not remember\nother details other than being very upset and he intended to get to\nsome other youth to fight, commenting he was not going to listen\nto staff and did not care they wanted to prevent him from doing\nso. They then told him that he was going to be escorted to a room\nfor time to cool off. Youth B was unsure if he resisted the restraint\nor not but commented he went into the bedroom willingly. Youth B\ncommented he has seen other youth be restrained during\nescalated incidents and had no concern about the need or\nimplementation for the physical interventions.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 08/14/2025 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He confirmed that he had spent a\nsignificant amount of time working with Youth A and had to\nparticipate in restraints with her. He described the work the\nprogram has put in with Youth A as “creative” and “agile.” Staff 1\ncommented Youth A had been removed from the units with other\nyouth recently and had been spending time alone in other units or\nin close observation areas of the facility. Administration has\ncreated different procedures in working with Youth A, such as\nallowing her into hallway areas youth would not normally be\nallowed in attempts to reduce the chance of physical\nrestraint. Staff 1 reported Youth A is quick to escalate and does\nnot often give cues that physical aggression could be occurring.\nHe believed that she had some cognitive limitations but was\nunsure. Staff 1 described common scenarios that would result in\nphysical escalation from Youth A, which did not always result in a\nrestraint. Staff 1 reported Youth A would randomly tell staff she\ncould knock them over or jump over them, and before any verbal\nde-escalation could occur, she would try to do so with full physical\nforce. Staff 1 believed that several restraints of Youth A occurred\npurely for her own physical safety. There were other instances\nwhen she had to be restrained to prevent further assault of youth\n3",
    "or staff, some of which resulted in hospitalizations. Youth A had\nshown assaultive behaviors such as impulsively attacking youth\nand staff, throwing water or bodily fluids at staff and picking up\nchairs and tables to with which to hit staff. Staff 1 believed any\nrestraint of Youth A only began because of physical contact she\ninitiated. Many times, Youth A’s restraints would be able to end\nquickly because she would assault staff, but then not resist the\nrestraint attempt. He noted the occasions she did resist restraints\nwere difficult because she was strong and determined.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed on 08/14/2025 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He reported struggles\nwith learning how to best work with Youth A in the face of what he\ndescribed as unpredictable behavior. Supervisor 2 felt the last\nweek or two involved having some breakthroughs with Youth A\nand understanding her better than prior. He believed her rapport\nwith him had increased as well. An example of this was she\nagreed to participate in a psychological evaluation only if\nSupervisor 2 were present, which is not normally within his job\nresponsibility but something he would do to help benefit Youth\nA. Supervisor 2 commented it was important to learn better how\nto work with and support Youth A because there was a chance\nshe could be in and out of the detention facility for the next few\nyears based on her age and living situation. Supervisor 2\ndescribed experiences participating in restraints with Youth A. He\ndescribed a recent restraint occurred when Youth A had assaulted\nstaff. When Supervisor 2 came to swap in, Youth A commented\nshe would stop resisting. Supervisor 2 described recent changes\nin working with Youth A to attempt to reduce physical\nincidents. Staff had been instructed to not attempt to stand in the\ndoorway that exited the vestibule near Youth A’s bedroom. This\nallowed her access to a hallway where youth were not normally\nallowed to access. Youth A would commonly go into this hallway\nand there were struggles with her behavior in that space.\nHowever, Supervisor 2 believed this was something that needed\nto be worked through compared to staff not allowing her access,\nwhich commonly resulted in Youth A escalating physically. Overall\nSupervisor 2 believed restraints of Youth A were warranted\nbecause of her assaultive and dangerous behavior and they were\nable to be performed as successful as possible. He believed\nYouth A resisted being restrained more often at the beginning of\nher placement, but her resistance has lessened the longer she’s\nbeen placed.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed on 08/14/2025 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He commented Youth\n4",
    "A was one of the most difficult to understand youth he had ever\nworked with at the facility. He stated this was because her\nbehavior was quick to escalate without cues that normally could\nbe seen with other youth as they escalated. Supervisor 3 believed\nYouth A displayed verbal “baiting” behaviors towards certain staff,\nspecifically Caucasian staff members. He had concerns she\ndisplayed racist behaviors. Supervisor 3 witnessed Youth A\n“testing” staff by stating she was going to do something assaultive,\nwaiting for their response and then acting on what she had\nstated. Supervisor 3 recalled an instance when he subbed in for\nanother staff when Youth A was in a standing team control\nrestraint and as soon as he did, she commented that she would\ncommit to safety and then she calmed down. Another instance\ninvolved Youth A first escalating by taking a drink cup from a staff\nmember and then beginning to threaten staff near her. Supervisor\n3 could not recall who this was. Supervisor 3 recalled staff\nmembers backing away from Youth A and not reacting to the staff\nmember’s taken item. Youth A then charged at a female staff and\nSupervisor 3 then felt a restraint attempt was unavoidable.\nSupervisor 3 recalled attempting a standing restraint with the\nassistance of Supervisor 2. He recalled Youth A allowing them to\nescort her to a different area away from the targeted staff member\nand as they did, she showed signs of relaxation by loosening her\nfists and her body feeling less tense. Supervisor 3 decided the\nrestraint could be ended and recalled Youth A then ran past then\nto physically attack staff after he and Supervisor 2 disengaged.\nYouth A then had to be restrained again. Supervisor 3 described\nthis as a good example of Youth A’s unpredictable and explosive\nbehavior. He felt unsure of Youth A’s physical and verbal cues of\ncalm behavior because there were examples of this behavior\nchanging immediately. He also remarked it had been difficult to\nattempt to remove staff members from situations that Youth A\nappeared to be triggered by or was targeting. This was caused by\nstaffing challenges. Supervisor 3 explained that staffing was\nlimited because of who was available at work as well as the\namount of staff that had been assigned to different levels of care\nand supervision specific to Youth A, reducing availability\nelsewhere in the program. Supervisor 3 commented it had been\nbeneficial for him and other staff to debrief and review security\ncamera footage of physically escalated incidents with Youth A.\nSupervisor 4 was interviewed on 08/14/2025 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He stated working\nwith Youth A on a consistent basis and on several occasions, he\nwas the supervisor that made the decision a restraint attempt was\nnecessary with her. He believed that he and other staff members\n5",
    "had attempted to and been able to avoid restraints with Youth A\nfor as long as possible. In his opinion they had attempted to avoid\nrestraints of Youth A longer than would have been implemented\nwith other youth. Supervisor 4 recalled frequent types of verbal\nescalation from Youth A in that she would be calm and without\ncontext would state “Should I hit you?”, “I can’t decide who to\nthrow this chair at” or “I don’t lie you, I am going to smack you in\nthe face.” Before staff could attempt to respond or verbally de-\nescalate Youth A, she would begin her physically assaultive\nbehavior. He recalled one specific instance when Youth A asked\nwhat time it was, and when answered she stated, “In five minutes I\nam going to hit you” and then attempted to do so as she stated\nshe would. He expressed concern that Youth A was large enough\nand strong enough that physically assaultive behavior had and\ncould injure youth and staff and that there were times when other\nyouth displaying the same behavior could have restraints avoided\nbecause they were not as unsafe. Supervisor 4 remarked Youth\nA’s exclusion from units with other youth was necessary for hers\nand their safety, but it also caused frequent tension and physical\nescalation because she would attempt to run past staff and\nassault them in the process. Supervisor 4 also recalled Youth A\nfrequently throwing items at staff, such as food, toilet water or\nbodily fluids on occasion. Supervisor 4 believed Youth A was\nfrequently assessing youth and staff for whom she could attempt\nto manipulate or scare with her behavior. He believed the facility\nhad done a good job in carefully assigning staff to work with Youth\nA in response but knew options were limited at times due to\nstaffing and the needs of other youth. Supervisor 4 believed any\nrestraint attempts of Youth A had always been in response to her\ninitiating physical contact and that staff had gained skills in\navoiding this when she was only verbally escalated or\nthreatening. He believed any restraints of Youth A were required\nfor safety of all involved by the time they were decided upon. An\nexample of this was recent changes in work with Youth A where\nstaff were allowing her access to a hallway that normally youth\nwould not have been allowed access to and would be escorted\nfrom. Supervisor 4 believed this change in procedure was\nwarranted to further attempt to avoid physical incidents with Youth\nA. Supervisor 4 recalled participating in frequent conversations\namong staff and administration on how to best work with Youth\nA. He was not fully aware of her diagnoses or treatment plan but\nstated a phrase he heard her utter once stuck in his head, “Hurt\npeople hurt people.”\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 08/14/2025 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He confirmed that he had worked\n6",
    "frequently with Youth A and had to participate in restraints with\nher, as well as restraints with other youth at the facility. In his\nwork with Youth A, Staff 2 believed that her explosive behavior\nwas based on her attempts to assess which staff she could\nmanipulate or not. Staff 2 stated Youth A escalated physically\nfaster than any other youth with which he had worked. She often\ndid not display body language or verbal cues that would give staff\nreason to see her escalation coming. He recalled an example of\nan incident with Youth A where she was in the vestibule of the\nsmaller bedroom location where she had been staying. Youth A\npicked up a small desk and stated “I am going to throw this desk\nat you” to Staff 2. She then immediately did so. Staff 2 was able\nto block the desk and did not get knocked down or injured. Before\nhe attempted to restrain Youth A he backed up to assess her\nbehavior next and in doing so Youth A sat down, and a restraint\nwas able to be avoided. Staff 2 also reported Youth A had\nphysically assaulted another staff member minutes before this\ninterview. He was present for this incident. He described her\nbehavior as unpredictable in that she was being walked down to\ntake a shower at a different part of the facility. Youth A was doing\nso in a calm manner and was not being physically escorted. As\nsoon as Youth A entered the shower area and noticed a staff\nmember, she had previously assaulted and then immediately\nattacked this staff member without any verbal or other physical\ncues. Staff 2 commented the restraint of Youth A in this instance\nwas very quick once the staff member she attacked was able to\nmove away from the situation. He also stated that restraint\nincidents with Youth A would commonly follow this pattern in that\nshe would have to be restrained to keep others safe from her and\nthen would show signs of quick de-escalation only to physically\nescalate and attempt to assault staff as soon as the restraint had\nto be ended. Staff 2 also discussed restraints of other youth at the\nprogram, including Youth B. He recalled an instance when he had\nto help perform a restraint and escort of Youth B with the\nassistance of Staff 3. Youth B was in an area of the facility where\nhe was not supposed to be and was verbally escalating. Staff 2\nrecalled Youth A being focused on wanting to fight other youth\nthat were elsewhere in an accompanying room down the\nhallway. He recalled Youth B stating, “I’m going to blow through\nyou and get to the day room.” Youth B was balling his fists and\nmaking flinch movements at Staff 2. Staff 2 recalled Youth B\nattempting to push through him and Staff 3. Staff 3 initiated the\nrestraint and Staff 2 assisted. They used a two man transport into\na nearby bedroom. Staff 2 recalled Youth B resisting some as this\noccurred, attempting to grab the doorframe of the room as they\n7",
    "entered and grabbed a nearby chair. Staff 2 noted that was the\none and only time he participated in a restraint with Youth B.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone on 08/18/2025. Staff 3\nconfirmed having worked frequently with Youth A and had\nparticipated in restraints with her. He felt that no matter how\naccommodating circumstances were made for Youth A, she would\nstill escalate and attempt to assault staff. This included daily\ninstances of spitting, hitting and throwing items at staff. Staff 3 felt\nthat the facility had made good efforts to adjust programming and\nstaffing in response to the greater behavioral needs of Youth A.\nHe also remarked that working with her was more difficult than\nmost youth because she had no “cues” that staff could learn to\nhelp avoid escalation. An example of this was a common\nexchange with Youth A where she would state something to the\neffect of “At 4:15 I am going to hit you” and she then would follow\nthrough, in addition to the frequent instances where she would\nattempt to assault staff without any warning. Staff 3 recalled\nparticipating in restraints with Youth A and a common theme was\nthat she would initially fight back but then show signs of calming\ndown, allowing staff to disengage. Youth A would then\nimmediately attempt to fight staff, causing restraint incidents to\nfrequently start and stop and start again. Staff 3 was asked about\nthe 06/24/2025 incident where Youth B was restrained. He\nrecalled being called for assistance as Youth B was getting upset\nin a hallway. As he approached Youth B was interacting with Staff\n2. Staff 3 recalled Youth B stating something about wishing he\nhad hit Staff 2 prior to the interaction. Youth B was escalating\nverbally and was stating that he wanted to move past staff to get\nto a room at the end of the hallway where other youth were in\norder to fight them. Staff 3 knew that the door to that room Youth\nB referenced was unlocked, and he felt concern that Youth B\nwould follow through. Staff 3 recalled Youth B attempting to move\npast Staff 2, so he and Staff 2 initiated a standing escort restraint.\nStaff 3 recalled Youth B continuing to be verbally escalated as this\noccurred, yelling threats and slurs. Youth B was escorted to a\nnearby bedroom within the hallway. Staff 3 recalled Youth B\nattempting to block entry to the room but then stopping.\nVideo reviewed:\n• Security camera footage located in multiple locations\nshowing ten separate restraint attempts of Youth A was\nprovided and reviewed.\no On 06/25/2025 Youth A was seen sitting in the\nvestibule area with two holding rooms. She stood up\nand walked towards the exit of the vestibule\n8",
    "area. Supervisor 2 attempted to block her from\nleaving the vestibule area. Youth A continued to\nattempt to move past staff to exit the vestibule area\nand Supervisor 2 initiated a restraint on his own,\nrapidly moving Youth A to the open bedroom and\nholding her over the bed. Youth A was standing with\nSupervisor 2 holding both of her wrists behind her\nwith his left hand and holding her torso down on the\nnext with his right hand on her upper back. After\nreleasing Youth A, Supervisor 2 attempted to leave\nthe room with Youth A attempting to leave with\nhim. Supervisor 2 had to make several attempts to\nmove Youth A back from the doorway to\nsuccessfully close the door.\no On 07/01/2025 Youth A was seen sitting in the\ncorner of the vestibule area with several staff in the\nroom with her. As she was sitting and staff were\nspeaking with her, Supervisor 2 initiated a restraint\non his own by taking a piece of clothing out of Youth\nA’s hands and attempting to lift her up. Youth A was\nplaced in a standing escort restraint and moved into\nthe open bedroom nearby. Youth A kicked her left\nleg in a manner that caused staff to fall to the\nground. Youth A was assisted to kneel at the back\nof the room so that staff could leave the room\nwithout her escalating further.\no On 07/02/2025 Youth A was seen in a unit with no\nother youth placed and several staff speaking with\nher. She was standing in a corner of the open area\nof the unit, near one exit door. Youth A was facing\naway from the door as several staff interacted with\nher. Youth A was then taken to the ground by staff\nand while initially lying on her stomach she was\nimmediately transitioned to a supine floor restraint.\n• Security camera footage located in a unit hallway dated\n06/24/2025 was provided and reviewed. In this footage\nYouth B could be seen standing with Staff 2 and Staff\n3. Youth B took a few slow steps down the hallway and\nStaff 3 initiated a restraint by taking hold of Youth B’s left\narm. Staff 2 followed suit and held Youth B’s right\narm. While standing and walking, Staff 2 and Staff 3\nescorted Youth B to an open bedroom. Youth B appeared\nto move with them under his own power. Video footage\ninside the bedroom was not available. Staff 2 and Staff 3\ncould be seen exiting the bedroom after approximately 30\nseconds.\n9",
    "Documentation reviewed:\n• The following facility policy & procedures were provided\nand reviewed:\no “Emergency Restraint” last dated 07/18/2022\noutlined policies & procedures regarding de-\nescalation of youth, implementation of restraints and\nthe documentation and debriefing after a restraint\nincident. The policy instructed that the use of\nemergency restraint was consistent with Licensing\nrules. It also stated that all youth placed will have\nBehavioral/Calming Plans designed at the time of\nadmission, to be used as proactive and preventative\nmeasures to avoid escalation.\no “Intervention Standards and Prohibitions” last dated\n06/22/2022 stated that staff were prohibited from\nthreats of restraint, seclusion, punishment or\notherwise suggesting physical or emotional harm to\nyouth.\n• Facility documents titled “Intensive Intervention Plan” were\nprovided and reviewed. This documentation individually\ndated 06/23/2025, 07/30/2025, 07/10/2025 and 07/16/2025,\ndescribed the facility’s efforts to plan for and support Youth\nA and any behaviors she was exhibiting. The\ndocumentation stated that the intent was to provide Youth\nA with more control over her behaviors in a more controlled\nenvironment. Safety steps outlined by Youth A’s clinician\nincluded locations where Youth A would be placed away\nfrom other youth, safety precautions to limit items that\nYouth A could take in her possession to be used to self-\nharm or harm others, increased eyes on supervision\nprocedures, and non-earned interventions or privileges that\nwere designed specifically for Youth A. Adaptations and\nadditions to the plans were seen through each successive\ndocument.\n• Documentation from Youth A’s case file pertaining to\nrestraints was reviewed. Since her placement at the facility\non 06/16/2025 to the date of this report she had been\nrestrained 38 times in 62 days. In that same time frame the\nfacility documented only 7 restraint incidents involving other\nyouth placed at the facility.\n• Facility Incident report documents describing incidents\ninvolving restraints of Youth A were provided and\nreviewed. Ten separate incidents were reviewed as a\nsample. Youth A attempting to move past staff and escape\nthe area designated for her and coming into physical\n10",
    "contact with staff was a common reason for restraints to be\ninitiated. The documentation consistently described each\nindividual restraint utilized over the course of an incident.\n• Facility Incident report documentation dated 06/24/2025\nand authored by Staff 3 was provided and reviewed. It was\ndocumented that Youth B had been refusing to follow any\nstaff directions or cease threatening other youth and staff\nfor roughly 45 minutes. Verbal de-escalation attempts by\nstaff were described. Youth B was described as\napproaching staff in an aggressive manner, making\ngestures that gave staff concern that he may attempt to\nstrike them. Youth B then continued to threaten other\nyouth and moved towards where other youth were\nlocated. Youth B was then placed in a standing high hold\nand escorted to a bedroom.\n• Employee records were reviewed for the following staff\ninvolved in restraints reviewed for this investigation:\no Staff 1 was originally trained in the facility restraint\nmodels as of 09/10/2024 and had one instance of\ndiscipline unrelated to matters of this investigation.\no Supervisor 2 was most recently trained in the facility\nrestraint models as of 01/27/2025 and had two\ninstances of discipline, one related to “standard\nconduct” and one related to “conduct of\nperformance.”\no Supervisor 3 most recently trained in the facility\nrestraint models as of 05/01/2025 and had no\ninstances of discipline.\no Supervisor 4 most recently trained in the facility\nrestraint models as of 03/20/2025 and had three\ninstances of discipline, all unrelated to matters of this\ninvestigation.\no Staff 2 most recently trained in the facility restraint\nmodels as of 07/10/2025 and had one instance of\ndiscipline unrelated to matters of this investigation.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per interviews, video\nreviewed, and documentation reviewed, the facility did not meet\nlicensing requirements. On multiple occasions staff initiated\nrestraints with youth who were not showing the severely\naggressive behavior outlined in policy and in response staff\ninitiated unwarranted restraints, including the restraints\ndocumented for 06/24/2025 with Youth B and 06/25/2025,\n07/01/2025 and 07/02/2025 with Youth A. These actions could\nhave resulted in further escalation or possible injury.\n11",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\n• Technical assistance was offered regarding narratives used\nwithin incident report documentation. The facility regularly\nprovided in depth descriptions of incidents but could\nprovide more clarity on the specific behaviors of concern\nthat led to the decision to initiate restraints.\n• Technical assistance was also offered regarding the need\nfor proper identification of types of incidents on\ndocumentation submitted to the department for review.\n• Technical assistance was provided in the area of reasons\nthat a youth would be restrained. The facility is advised to\navoid initiating restraints solely because of a youth\nattempting to leave a room or area if there is no immediate\nrisk of harm to self or others.\nCONSULTATION:\nConsultation was provided regarding the facility’s practices to\nallow for staff members to share positive attempts at rapport\nbuilding and successful prevention and de-escalation strategies\namong staff. In addition, consultation was provided regarding the\nprovision of psychological and case file information of youth\namong staff.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2025SIC0000335 approved 3/3/25; CAP approved 3/12/25\nSIR #2024C0000915SI approved 12/20/23; CAP approved 1/8/24\nSIR #2024C0000834SI approved 11/22/23, CAP approved 12/18/23\nIV.
