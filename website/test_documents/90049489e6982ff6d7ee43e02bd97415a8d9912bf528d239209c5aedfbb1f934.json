Youth B reported when he\nmeets with the Psychiatrist, and she prescribes a new medication\nit takes a few days for the facility to receive the medications from\nthe pharmacy. In December 2023 Youth B was prescribed a new\ndose of medication and it took two days for the new dose of\nAdderall to arrive at the facility. Youth B reported that was the\nonly time he did not have his medication. Youth B reported he\nalways receives his medications at the time prescribed. Youth B\nreported there was one time he was on an off grounds activity and\ndid not return in time to receive his medications in the time frame.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n2/5/2024. Youth C reported he takes medications at the facility.\nYouth C reported the only time he has not received his\nmedications at the facility is when he is prescribed a new dose of\nmedication or a new medication from the Psychiatrist and it takes\n2",
    "a few days for the medication to be approved and arrive at the\nfacility from the pharmacy. Youth C reported he has refused\nmedications at the facility when he is mad. Youth C reported he\ndoes not refuse medications often. Youth C did not have any\nother concerns with receiving his medications.\nYouth D was interviewed via teams on 2/13/2024. Youth D\nreported he is prescribed daily medications at the facility. Youth D\nreported one of his prescribed medications was to be given at\n2pm however staff continued to forget to pass the medication, so\nthe time was changed to have the medication passed at 12pm.\nYouth D did not have any other concerns regarding his\nmedications.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n2/5/2024 and via telephone 2/6/2024. Administrator 1 reported\nhe was made aware of Youth B and Youth C not receiving their\nmedications in November/December for a few days due to an\nissue with the pharmacy trying to get in contact with Psychiatrist\nand the Psychiatrist not returning the telephone call to the\npharmacy. Administrator 1 advised the Nurse to work to resolve\nthe issue. Administrator 1 reported Nurse notified him via\ntelephone text message that the pharmacy did not have a\nprescription from Psychiatrist. Nurse addressed the issue, and it\nwas resolved in three days. The issue was the Psychiatrist said\nthey called in the prescription and the pharmacy was saying they\ndid not receive the prescription. Psychiatrist was contacted\nhowever did not return the call right away. Psychiatrist, once able\nto be reached, sent the prescription to the pharmacy.\nAdministrator 1 reported the facility has not had issues with\nmedications with the pharmacy, there have been some issues he\nis aware of with staff not passing medication and he addressed\nthose concerns internally with staff discipline. Administrator 1\nlooked further into the medication administration record (MAR)\nand reported he has found an issue with staff sending medications\non outings and he will be addressing that with staff. Administrator\n1 reported the facility has been in contact with Psychiatrist’s\nsupervisor to address concerns of not returning phone calls timely\nand the facility is exploring other options for psychiatric services.\nAdministrator 1 reported he was aware of an issue with\nmedication not being available through the pharmacy due to a\nshortage and he reached out to other pharmacies to confirm this\nand attempt other avenues to get the medication filled however all\npharmacy’s he spoke to were unable to fill the prescription due to\noutage.\n3",
    "Administrator 2 was interviewed via teams on 2/9/2024.\nAdministrator 2 reported the only medications concerns in\nNovember 2023 at the facility was addressed through staff write\nups regarding Youth D. Administrator 2 reported there were some\nchanges with the facility moving to Advanced Specialty RX as\ntheir pharmacy of use, however Administrator 2 could not recall\nany specific concerns. Administrator 2 reported she feels staff\ncould document in the electronic MAR better in the notes section\nwhen they are selecting the option of medication not available on\ncart or refuse. Administrator 2 reported she thinks when it is\ndocumented in the MAR that the medication was not available on\ncart, yet the youth had the medication earlier in the day or later in\nthe day, that staff are not locating the correct package or not\nconfident enough to dispense the same medication that may\nindicate it is to be given at a different time. Many times, the\nmedication is on the cart, and it is not being documented\naccurately.\nNurse was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 2/5/2024\nand via teams on 2/9/2024. Nurse reported she returned to\nworking at the facility on November 1, 2023, and the facility began\nusing a new pharmacy service around November 8, 2023. Nurse\nwent through all youth medication and reconciled medications.\nNurse reported there were no issues in November with youth not\nreceiving medications at the facility due to the facility not having\nthe medications on site. The new pharmacy utilizes an electronic\nMAR and there has been learning curves with the new system\nsuch as the system was not allowing a medication to be given in\nthe hour timeframe, it was noting in the system the medication\nwas being given late. Nurse worked with the pharmacy, and it\nwas corrected in December. Another learning curve with the new\nsystem was over the counter standing medications were showing\nin the electronic MAR as an exception and was generating an\nemail saying there was a medication issue. Nurse worked to get\nthis issue addressed. Nurse reported there were no known issues\nthat she was aware of with Youth B receiving his medications in\nNovember 2023. There was an issue with Youth B’s medication\non December 4, 5, and 6th due to Psychiatrist not refilling the\nprescription with the pharmacy. Nurse reported there was an\nissue with Youth A and Youth B’s Focalin as the medication was\nnot available as the pharmacy did not have it. Nurse reported per\nlooking at the electronic MAR Youth C shows “medication not in\ncart” for a few days for his Loratadine however this appears to be\ncoded incorrectly by staff as Youth C had his medication one day\nand then there was inconsistencies where the MAR shows it was\ngiven and then “medication not in cart” which would not have been\n4",
    "possible as the medications were coming in the strip package at\nthat time. Nurse reported the MAR for Youth C documents\nLoratadine “medication not in cart” for 11/20/2023-11/30/2023\nhowever this was not accurate. Youth C’s Loratadine was\navailable as the delivery manifest shows Youth C’s Loratadine\nwas delivered on 11/2/2023 with 30 pills. Nurse reported when\nstaff are taking youth off grounds for outings, an email is sent with\nthe youth that will be going and Nurse checks to see if\nmedications need to be sent with the supervisor and sends the\nmedications. When medications are dispensed while on an\nouting, the MAR does not reflect anything different, it just shows\nthe medication was given.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 2/5/2024.\nStaff 1 has passed medications at the facility for approximately\nfour years. Staff 1 reported no knowledge of any issues with the\nfacility not receiving medications from the pharmacy. Youth C has\nhad situations where medications are changed by the Psychiatrist,\nand it takes one to two days for the new medication/dose to arrive\nat the facility after his doctor appointments. Staff 1 has never been\nwritten up for any medication errors. The facility changed to a\ndifferent pharmacy company and initially the medications were\ncoming in a strip pack verses blister pack however they now are\ncoming in blister packs. Staff 1 reported if a medication is not on\nthe medication cart staff document that in the electronic MAR by\nchoosing the drop-down box “medication not in cart”. Staff 1\nreported no concerns with medications at the facility.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 2/5/2024.\nStaff 2 reported she was not aware or could not recall the facility\nhaving any issues with medication in November/ December. Staff\n2 reported Youth D had a few missed medications due to staff\nerrors and Staff 3 received a write up and suspension for the\nmissed medications. Staff 2 did not have any knowledge of Youth\nA, Youth B, or Youth C not having medication in November/\nDecember. There have been pharmacy issues when the\nPsychiatrist writes a new prescription and discontinues the old\nprescription as the Psychiatrist notifies the pharmacy and the\npharmacy makes the changes right away in the electronic MAR\nhowever the issue was the change was being made prior to the\nnew medication being filled and sent to the facility by the\npharmacy. Staff 2 reported this occurred for approximately a\nmonth however the facility has met with the pharmacy to address\nthe concern, and this is no longer occurring. Staff 2 did not know\nhow long it takes from a new prescription being sent to the\npharmacy until the facility receives the medication. Staff 2\n5",
    "recalled there was an issue where the pharmacy did not have a\nmedication however Staff 2 did not have all the details of the\nmedication and the youth who it impacted. Staff 2 reported\nsupervisors on shift pass medication and if needed, Staff 2 steps\nin and passes medications occasionally. Staff 2 reported the\nfacility does not have many medication errors.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 2/5/2024.\nStaff 3 passes medication when he is covering a supervisor’s role\non shift. Staff 3 reported he is aware of medication concerns as\nsupervisors report to him and would inform him of any concerns\nregarding medications. Supervisor 3 was not aware of any\nmedication concerns for Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, or any youth\nat the facility in November 2023. Staff 3 reported the facility\nchanged pharmacies in November/ early December 2023. When\nthe facility changed pharmacies there was a learning curve as\nmedications had always been provided in blister packs and the\nnew pharmacy provided medications in a packaged strip however\nthis was nothing that resulted in any issues with medications being\npassed. Staff 3 reported he was written up for a medication error\nthat was with Youth D however he did not have any other\nknowledge of youth not receiving their medication.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via telephone on 2/12/2024. Staff 4\nreported in November the facility changed pharmacy providers\nand for a short time the medications were coming in prepacked\nstrip packaging. Staff 4 reported there were concerns with not all\nthe youth’s medications being packaged correctly as there were\nmissing pills in the packaging. Staff 4 was unable to provide any\nspecific youth impacted by this. Staff 4 indicated the situation was\nrectified quickly as the facility went back to the previously used\npharmacy.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via teams on 2/13/2024. Staff 5 did not\nhave any concerns with youth receiving medications at the facility\nin November 2023. The facility recently changed pharmacy\nproviders from Pharmascript to Advanced Specialty RX. When\nthe change occurred, medications changed from coming in blister\npacks to arriving in strip packaging where the medication was\npackaged together with a label indicating the medication date and\ntime to be dispensed. Staff 5 did not recall any concerns with the\nmedications not being properly packaged, and indicated to his\nknowledge all the prescribed medications for the youth at the\nindicated time were in the package. In early December 2023\nthere were a few youth, however Staff 5 did not recall specifically\nwho or what medications, who had prescriptions on the MAR that\n6",
    "had not arrived at the facility yet. Staff 5 did not know why the\nmedications had not arrived at the facility. Staff 5 reported he has\nnever received discipline for issues with administering\nmedications. Consultant reviewed the discipline that the facility\nprovided for Staff 5. Staff 5 reported he never received the\ndiscipline and had no idea he missed giving Youth D his\nmedication on 11/12/2023.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Wolverine Human Services (WHS) Medication Control\nAdministration Policy and Site Protocols Policy: WHS\nprohibits dispense prescription medication without a\nprescription or dispensing one client’s prescription\nmedication to any other youth.

Staff 4 was\ndisciplined for this occurring.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Wolverine Human Services (WHS) Medication Control\nAdministration Policy and Site Protocols Policy: The facility\npolicy does not address medication dispensing while youth\non on facility off ground activities.\n• Email provided from the facility dated 2/7/2024 indicating\nYouth D did not get his medication on 11/26/2023 due to\nYouth D being on a facility outing and medications were not\nsent on the outing to be given. Youth O was on a facility\nouting on 11/23/2023 and medications were not sent on the\nouting to be given.\n• Staff 4’s personnel file: Staff 4 received Employee\nCounseling on 11/15/2023 for not passing Youth D’s\nmedication. Staff 4 had one other discipline in their\npersonnel file unrelated to medications. Staff 4 received\nmedication training 6/4/2023 and 12/8/2023.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance as Staff 4 did not dispense\nmedications to Youth D while off grounds. Youth D did not receive\nhis medications while on an off-ground outing on 11/22/2023 and\n11/24/2023, and Youth O on 11/23/2023 due to staff not\npackaging the medication to dispense while off grounds. The\nfacility does not have a policy/procedure to address dispensing\nmedications while off grounds on facility activities.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is recommended the facility include policy/procedure to address\ndispensing medications while on off ground outings, when youth\nare AWOLP, and when youth are at the hospital.\nConclusion Violation Established\n12",
