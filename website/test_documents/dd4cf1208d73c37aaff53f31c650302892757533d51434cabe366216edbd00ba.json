Staff began\ncursing at Youth A and threatened him. Staff member flinched at Youth A at some\npoint during the argument.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was transferred for investigation by DHHS and the complaint noted\nthe following:\n3",
    "Youth A (16) is a juvenile delinquent that is currently placed at Highfields Inc.\nStaff 1 is an employee at the facility. Yesterday, Youth A and Staff 1 had a verbal\naltercation which escalated. Staff 1 began cursing at Youth A and threatened\nYouth A stating, \"I will fuck you up.\" Staff 1 also flinched at Youth A at some point\nduring the argument. Staff 1 was sent home and will not return pending an\ninvestigation. Youth A and Staff 1 have not been around each other since the\nincident. This is an isolated incident for both Staff 1 and Youth A.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Worker via phone, on 09/08/20. The Worker reported that\nshe was aware of Youth A having behavioral issues over the weekend and another\nincident today. The Worker provided some historical information on Youth A. The\nWorker reported that she has been in touch with the facility during the time Youth A\nhas been placed there, which has only been a few weeks. The Worker reported no\nconcerns with the facility.\nI interviewed the Chief Administrator (CA) at the facility on 09/09/20. The CA noted\nthat he reported these allegations after being notified by the Supervisor. The CA\nverified the complaint information and provided Staff 2’s written statement. Staff 1\nwas removed from the schedule pending the investigation. The CA reported that\nStaff 1 was on vacation out of town and his phone number was provided. The CA\nnoted that video review does not provide clarification as there is no audio. The CA\nlater confirmed via email that Staff 1 has no disciplinary action in his employee file.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 09/09/20. Youth A reported that he has been\nat the program for about two or three weeks. When asked about this incident, Youth\nA said that nothing happened. Youth A said that he and Staff 1 were arguing but\ndenied the Staff 1 threatened him. Youth A said he did not know why this was\nreported. Youth A said he feels safe in this program and agreed that he would tell\nsomeone if staff threatened him or used profanity toward him like in this allegation.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility, on 09/09/20. Staff 2 reviewed her incident\nreport/written statement and confirmed that she authored it. Staff 2 said that she\nheard Staff 1 and Youth A get into an argument and it escalated when Youth A was\nusing Staff 1’s first name. Staff 2 reported that Staff 1 said, “my name is fucking Staff\n1.” Staff 2 reported hearing Staff 1 say other things during this exchange, such as,\n“fuck you,” “I’ll fuck you up right now,” and “bitch ass nigga.” Staff 2 stated that Youth\nA was also using profanity with and toward Staff 1, but Staff 2 felt Youth A was\ndefending himself. Staff 2 said there was no physical contact between the two, but\nworried that this situation was escalating. Staff 2 split up the two and directed Staff 2\nto go to the office as the other kids in the unit began escalating and talking about\nrioting. Staff 1 reportedly continued to try and engage Youth A after the incident and\nStaff 2 redirected him. Staff 2 said that Staff 1 later left his shift after reporting he\nwas sick. Staff 2 reported that Staff 1 is usually not like this but has heard him swear\nin front of the kids prior to this incident, but noted it was not like this incident. Staff 2\nsaid that she notified the Supervisor after the shift.\n4",
    "I interviewed the Supervisor at the facility on 09/09/20. The Supervisor reported that\nshe was not in the unit when this incident occurred and noted that Staff 2 told her\nafter the shift was over. The Supervisor reported that she then told Staff 2 that Staff\n2 should have notified the Supervisor when the incident occurred and not after the\nshift was over. The Supervisor said that Staff 2 told her that Staff 1 was cursing\ntoward Youth A and also threatened to beat Youth A up. The Supervisor said that\nStaff 1 contacted her during the shift and asked to leave work because he was sick.\nThe Supervisor said she never heard Staff 1 swear around kids before and was\nshocked by this report. The Supervisor said that after she was advised of this, she\ntold her supervisor, who is the Chief Administrator, and directed Staff 2 to write up a\nstatement of what occurred.\nI interviewed Youth B via phone on 09/24/20. Youth B reported that he recalled this\nincident and remembered Youth A and Staff 1 arguing but did not know what it was\nabout. Youth B said that Staff 1 seemed intimidated by Youth A during the\naltercation, but Youth B did not recall Staff 1 making any of the comments noted in\nthe allegations. Youth B said he was telling Youth A to calm down. Youth B denied\nhearing Staff 1 threaten Youth A. After the incident, Youth B said that Staff 1 tried to\ntalk to Youth A but Youth A “was not trying to hear it.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 09/25/20 via phone. Staff 1 reported that he recalled the\nincident. Staff 1 said that the group had come inside the unit and he was getting\nwater for youth. Staff 1 said that Youth A was heard saying things like, “Staff 1, fuck\nyou,” and “I’ll beat your ass.” Staff 1 said that Youth A then came out of his room\nwithout permission to get his own water and was confronted by Staff 1. Staff 1 said\nthat Youth A was using profanity and admitted to using profanity back at Youth A\nduring this incident. Staff 1 said that he said things like, “You’re not going to beat my\nass,” and “I’m not a bitch ass nigga.” Staff 1 denied threatening Youth A. Staff 1 said\nthat Youth A went back to his room and Staff 2 then talked to Staff 1. After a while\nwhen the kids came back out of their rooms, Staff 2 said that he heard that Youth A\nwas plotting to get him fired and another youth told Youth A, “No, he’s cool.” Staff 1\nsaid that he ended up leaving that day early from his shift due to having an upset\nstomach and called in the following day because he was still feeling sick.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows with applicable\ninformation noted:\n Incident Report/written statement, authored by Staff 2, dated 09/05/20. Report\nwas consistent with Staff 2’s interview.\n House Guidelines (A positive tone needs to be set by staff.)\n Employee policy for misconduct taken from the employee handbook (Actions\nhostile and counterproductive to the standards of care, discipline, and\ntreatment, and counseling appropriate to Highfields; Conduct which could\nnegatively impact Highfields’ relationship with a customer, visitor, or fellow\nemployee; other violations)\n Employee handbook receipt form, signed by Staff 1, dated 06/10/20\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe discipline,\nincluding any of the following:\n(c) Verbal abuse, ridicule, or humiliation.\nANALYSIS: The facility is not compliant with the rule as Staff 1 admitted to\nusing profanity toward Youth A. This language is contradictory\nto the facility’s policies and procedures, which call for a positive\ntone from staff and for staff actions to be in line with the\ntreatment and counseling provided by the facility. Engaging in\nthe verbal altercation and using profanity only served to escalate\nthis situation and was not positive or productive.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nNovember 04, 2020\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 5, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
