Birth Parent O reported he\nhas three children, Child A (age 13), Child B (age 7) and Child C (age 5), placed via\nCatholic Charities or Shiawassee and Genesee County (CCSGC). Foster Worker\n(FCW) 2 is assigned to their case. Birth Parent O reported FCW 2 only tries to upset\nhim. He did not give specifics on how or why she tries to upset him but reported\nFCW 2 called him a “nigger”. He did not report when FCW 2 called him this name.\nNor the circumstances in which the incident occurred. He reported trying to speak\nwith FCW 2’s supervisors, about her behavior, but FCW 2 intercepted his call and\nwould not allow him to do so.\nOn 1/13/2022 I interviewed FCW 2 by telephone. FCW 2 denied ever calling Birth\nParent O out of his name or making derogatory remarks about him. She reported\nher contact with Birth Parent O has been limited and mostly by text messages. She\nreported, it is Birth Parent O who has called her names; and he has threatened her.\nBirth Parent O told her the problem with the case is that she is white. He has refused\nin person contacts with her. She has asked him to come in to sign various\npaperwork, and he has refused.\nFCW 2 denied ever not responding to Birth Parent O’s calls; or trying to keep Birth\nParent O from speaking with her supervisor. She advised there was time that Birth\nParent O contacted the office and asked to speak with Supervisor 3 about a reported\nemergency situation. The call was on hold. Supervisor 3 was not available; and she\ntried to find out what Birth Parent O’s matter was about. She tried to talk with him,\nbut he would not disclose the purpose of his call. He reported just wanting\nSupervisor 3 to contact him; and Supervisor 3 did so. Supervisor 3 texted her to say\nSupervisor 3 called Birth Parent O, but he did not answer.\nOn 1/13/2022, I spoke with Child Welfare Director (CWD) 1 and Supervisor 3 about\nthe allegations, during separate telephone calls. Both CCSGC employees reported\nhaving no reason to believe the allegations to be credible. Neither had ever\n3",
    "observed or heard of FCW 2 being disrespectful to any parent. No birth parent or\nperson had contacted them to report such a concern related to FCW 2.\nSupervisor 3 denied Birth Parent O ever contacting her to report concerns about\nFCW 2. She reported being aware of one telephone call from Birth Parent O, a week\nago. She was busy and asked FCW 2 to take the call and advise him she would\ncall him back. Birth Parent O hung up on FCW 2. Supervisor 3 advised she did not\nget an opportunity to contact him back before going on leave and family\nemergencies. After her return, recontacting him slipped her mind. She had met with\nhim once on 12/15/2021.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications.\n(1) An agency shall require a staff who has ongoing contact\nwith children or parents to be a person who has the ability,\nexperience, education, and training to perform the duties\nassigned.\nANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to support the allegations or that\nthe worker did not demonstrate the ability, experience,\neducation, and training to perform her assigned duties.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe birth parent has not been provided visitation with his children.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/13/2022 I interviewed Birth Parent O by telephone. Birth Parent O reported his\nvisits with his children are not occurring regularly as they should. He reported there\nwas supposed to be a makeup visit for him, which was to last three hours, last\nThursday. Thirty minutes before the visit was to start, FCW 2 terminated the visit.\nHe tried to speak with Supervisor 3 about this, but FCW 2 blocked him from doing\nso. Birth Parent O did not report any other visits not being scheduled or terminated.\nOn 1/13/2022 I interviewed FCW 2 and Supervisor 3 about the allegation by\ntelephone. Both CCSGC employees reported a visitation plan is in place for Birth\nParent O with the children. Additionally, that it has been Birth Parent O who has not\nshown up for visits, which are court ordered to occur at the agency every Tuesday\nand Thursday. Both employees reported no visits have been cancelled, except for\nonce when the children were sick and once when Birth Parent O did not show up in\na timely manner.\nFCW 2 reported until today, Birth Parent O had not attended a single visit since the\ncase was opened in September 2021. Birth parent O had been a no call, or no show\n4",
    "for visits until today. On 1/4/2022 there was not a visit because the children were\nsick. Birth Parent O requested the children be taken to the doctor due to that; and\nthe agency ensured the medical visits were done. Birth Parent O cancelled the next\nvisit on 1/6/2022, due reportedly to him not wanting the children to travel since they\nhad been sick. FCW 2 reported a visit in October 2021 was canceled before Birth\nParent O had not showed up. He was an hour late. The agency policy indicates they\ncan cancel after 15 minutes; but they will allow more time, but not an hour, without a\ncall. FCW 2 advised that in December 2021 the court ordered that Birth Parent O\nmust call the agency an hour before the visit, to informed them he will be present for\nthe visit. Birth Parent O did so today for today’s visit.\nReviewed\nChild A, Child B and Child C’s MISACWIS case record which showed information as\nreported by the agency related to visitation.\n‘s\nR 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nAn agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nparenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the\nfollowing:\n(a)A plan of visitation for each child in foster care\nconsistent with the child’s service plan, as required by\nR400.12419 and R400.12420 to assure the safety and\nwellbeing of the child.\nANALYSIS: The evidence does not support the allegations. A visitation plan\nfor Birth Parent O with his children is in place. Birth Parent O\nhad missed numerous visits. He was a no call or no show for the\nscheduled Tuesday and Thursday visits.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThere are concerns that the children have been taken out of state and placed there.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/7/2022 I interviewed Birth Parent O by telephone. Birth Parent O reported on\n12/28/2021 the judge ordered that his children be placed in Ohio, with Relative M.\nHe reported discovering the children had been placed in Ohio before the reported\nDecember 2021 date; and no one told him. He reported the children were supposed\nto be placed with Relatives L in Lapeer from 9/11/2021 until 12/28/2021. He reported\nknowing the children were in Ohio with Relative M, the daughter to Relatives L\nbecause someone has seen them there. He said the plan was never for his children\nto go to Relative M. He believes FCW 2 is trying to help Relative M get his children\nto adopt them.\n5",
    "On 1/13/2022 I interviewed FCW 2 and Supervisor 3 by telephone. Both CCSGC\nemployees reported Child A, Child B and Child C remain placed with Relatives L in\nLapeer. The children have not been replaced to Relative M. Relatives M assists her\nparenting with the care of the children.\nFCW 2 reported the Children Protective Services (CPS) worker, not the agency set\nup the children’s placements with Relative L, for Birth Parent O. Birth Parent O had\noriginally asked for the children to be placed in Ohio with Relative M, but Birth\nParent O couldn’t sign off his rights timely in order for the placement to occur.\nAdditionally, CPS reported they could not do the placement in Ohio due to ICPC\n(Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children) issues. FCW 2 reported the\nchildren had been going back and forth between Lapeer, Michigan, and Ohio since\nSeptember 2021. This was all set up by CPS; no one gave them guidance about this\narrangement.\nFCW 2 said the children were placed with Relatives L, when she was assigned the\ncase, but the children were in Ohio with Relative M. She discovered that in\nSeptember 2021 after the children were being unavailable for her to visit with them.\nShe advised her director of that situation. Then someone at the department let her\nand Supervisor 2 know about the situation. FCW 2 requested the children be\nbrought back to Lapeer so that she could conduct her home visit with them. She\nreported Child A, Child B and Child C would go to Ohio for weekly visits with\nRelative M. Relatives L would let her/the agency know when the children would go to\nRelative M and whether it was for a day, a week or more. FCW 2 reported there\nhave been times the children were in care with Relative M ranging from a few days\nto two weeks. The children were with Relatives L on Christmas and had been with\nRelative M the last couple of weeks. FCW 2 reported this visitation stay\narrangement was in place because Relative M is Relatives L’s alternative caregiver.\nRelative M assists her parents/Relatives L with transportation and medical\nappointments. Relative M brings the children to the agency for their parenting time\nwith Birth Parent O. The children attend school online; and Relative M ensures their\nattendance. FCW 2 reported the only reason the children are not placed with\nRelative M is because there is no approved ICPC home study for Relative M. FCW 2\nreported she has not completed a ICPC request because she has not been able to\nobtain the social security cards for the children.\nFCW 2 did not document the children’s lengthy contacts with Relative M or\nabsences from placement. She reported not documenting those contacts in\nMISACWIS or the service plan, because Relative M was servicing as the alternative\ncare provider.\nSupervisor 3 affirmed FCW 2 reporting related to CPS setting of the children’s\nplacement with Relatives L. Additionally, that the children were going back and forth\nbetween the two families when CCSGC accepted the case. Supervisor 2 reported\nRelatives L had initially reported they would care for the children long term; but\n6",
    "shortly afterward, due to financial issues, reported they could not. Supervisor 3 said\na CPS/foster Care TDM (Team Decision Meeting) by DHHS Worker X in September\n2021 indicated that; and that Relative M reported she could plan for the children long\nterm. Supervisor 3 acknowledged the TDM document does not indicate anything\nabout the children going back and forth with Relative M in Ohio. She reported on\n12/15/2021, Birth Parent O reported that he did not want the visits to Ohio to\ncontinue. Birth Parent O was under the impression the children were placed in Ohio,\nbut that was not true. Supervisor 3 told FCW 3 to discontinue the visits. She did not\nknow they were continuing or that there were times the children were with Relative\nM in Ohio for a week or two weeks. She thought Relative M was just getting the\nchildren for the weekend, for respite. Relative M was taking the children to doctor\nappointments for her parents and transporting the children to parenting time.\nSupervisor 3 reported these stays away from the placement/these visitations were\nnot documented because she did not know the visitations were that extensive. She\nreported a plan to follow up and have the contacts added to social contacts in\nMISACWIS.\nOn 1/20/2022 I interviewed the CPS Department of Health and Human Services\n(DHHS) Worker X by telephone. DHHS Worker X affirmed Supervisor 3’s reporting\nabout DHHS Worker X placing the children with Relatives L and the family later\nindicating they could no longer plan long term. Relatives L reported they would keep\nthe children, but they needed help with the children. Their daughter, Relative M was\ngoing to be coming up to their home to help. DHHS Worker X reported being aware\nof Relative M. She advised that Birth Parent O and the children’s birth mother were\ninitially willing to do a safety plan for the children to be placed out of state in Ohio\nwith Relative M. The birth parents did not act timely to work with DHHS Worker X on\nthat plan. An emergency removal happened, and the children were placed with\nRelatives L.\nDHHS Worker X reported she told Relatives L the children would have to stay in\nLapeer. Relative M had contacted her, asked about visits with the children and\nwhether Relative M could change the children’s schools. She advised Relative M\neverything had to be approved, that Relative M needed to talk with the foster care\nworker about all that. DHHS Worker X reported the issue of the children going back\nand forth; staying in Lapeer and Ohio is something that would have occurred after\nthe children were with CCSGC. She assumed the children would likely visit Relative\nM, because Relative M is related, but not that the children would be staying with\nRelative M in Ohio, a week, two weeks, any length of time. She reported that’s not\nsomething she approved or had input in. Her supervisor advised her the children\ncould not visit Relative M without agency approval, because the children can’t go\nacross state lines. She assumed the DHHS- POS monitor informed FCW 2 of that.\nDHHS Worker X reported that sometime after the case was with CCSGC, FCW 2\ncalled her about the ICPC. She advised FCW 2 that foster care, not DHHS Worker X\ncompletes that task. DHHS Worker X reported the relatives, and CCSGC were\naware of what had to happen before any visits with Relative M in Ohio or an out of\nstate placement could occur.\n7",
    "On 2/4/2022 I interviewed Purchase of Service (POS)Worker XX by telephone. POS\nWorker XX denied she/DHHS giving the agency or the relatives any type of\nauthorization for any type of visits out of state. She said, Relative M is approved for\nsubstitute care, but not placement. She reported, the matter of the children possibly\ngoing back and forth between the two relatives came up the first week in January\n2022. A meeting had occurred with CCSGC in December 2021, advising them that\nin order for Relative M to be approved for placement of the children an ICPC has to\noccur. The court had also gotten involved and ordered the agency to complete the\nICPC paperwork.\nOn 2/18/2022 I spoke with CWD 1. She reported the children were replaced from\nRelatives L’s home on 2/18/2022. Visits with Relative M were no longer occurring\nand the ICPC was still pending.\nReviewed\nMISACWIS case record for Child A, Child B and Child C which showed that:\n All three children were placed together with Relatives L on 9/10/2021.\n All three children remained in placement with Relatives L until 2/18/2022\nwhen they were placed together in a licensed foster home.\n No documentation showing the children temporary stays with Relative L. Nor\nsocial work contacts related to the fact that the temporary stays had occurred.\n A 9/15/2021(completed by DHHS Worker X) and 9/29/2021(completed by\nFCW 2) TDM.\n Neither TDM narratives indicated any information related to the\nchildren being approved to go back and forth to Ohio; or for the\nchildren to stay there for any periods of time. The plan at both TDM’s\nwas that the current placement would be maintained.\n The 9/29/2021 TDM indicated: A discussion was had about moving the\nchildren to Ohio with Relative M; the case worker would complete\nICPC paperwork. Additionally, that Relative M is to transport the\nchildren to and from parenting times.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(3) The agency shall document all of the following in the\nchild's record before a change of placement occurs:\n(f) Notification to the parents, referral source, lawyer\nguardian ad litem, and courts when applicable, of the\nchange in placement.\n8",
    "ANALYSIS: The children did not change placement.\nThe children were having visitations and extended stays with\nRelative M in Ohio. There is no violation of this rule but there is\na violation with respects to R400.12207(3)(a) shown below with\nrespect to departmental policies.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\nANALYSIS FOM Policy 722-6H mandates that all case contacts must be\nentered in MiSACWIS, including attempted contacts, and\nmissed appointments. The case contact narrative should consist\nof a brief summary of the contact. Significant information\nobtained during the contact must be summarized in the\nappropriate section of the case service plan.\nCommunication issuance 17-168 indicated that absences from\nplacement for six to 14 days require approval by the caseworker\nand supervisor and must be documented in the record via a\nsocial contact. (Note the communication issuance is not being\ncited. This paragraph is intended to explain why the policy is\nbeing cited.)\nThe agency worker admitted she did not document all her\ncontacts with Relatives L and Relative M related to the\nchildren’s back and forth visits from Lapeer, Michigan to Ohio.\nNor the visits which ranged from a few days to up to two weeks.\nAdditionally, the agency did not inform the children’s parents of\neach of these visits. Nor was it clearly documented that the\nchildren’s Guardian Ad Litem was informed of each of these\nvisitation stays.\n9",
    "In this incident the agency staff person(s) did not work with all\nentities or related to the development of the children and\nfamily’s service plans.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\nANALYSIS: ICM 130 -Interstate foster care request policy states:\nUnder the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children\n(ICPC), the following requests must be referred to local MDHHS\noffices for services:\n Home studies and licensing of a prospective placement\nresource for a foster child under court or state\nsupervision in another state.\n Supervision of the placement of a child with a\nparent/relative when the child is under court or state\njurisdiction in another state.\nThe agency allowed Child A, Child B and Child C to have\nextended visits with Relative M in Ohio without an approved-out\nof state home study or ICPC approval.\nIn this incident the agency staff person(s) did not work with all\nentities, or related to the development of the children and\nfamily’s service plans.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n10",
