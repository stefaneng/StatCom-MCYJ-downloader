    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth D may have been exposed to ringworm and did not receive\nneeded timely medical attention for an ongoing cough.\nInvestigation This investigation was assigned to me on 3/27/24.\nInterviews:\nI contacted Complainant via email. She had no additional\nlicensing concerns relative to Wolverine Center.\nI contacted Youth D’s Foster Care Worker and notified her of the\nDCWL investigation assignment. She expressed no additional\nlicensing concerns.\nI interviewed Youth D, age 17 years, 11 months, jointly with\nGovernment Worker 1 on 3/28/24. He appeared drowsy,\ndisplayed disorganized speech, and mumbled his words. Youth D\nwas admitted to the facility’s short-term shelter on 3/1/24.\nAccording to MISACWIS, this is his first out-of-home placement. I\nobserved a hospital band on his wrist.\nSince his admission to Wolverine Center, Youth D said he has\nbeen to the hospital emergency room several times for various\nreasons. At one point during the interview, his thoughts fixated on\nsomeone at the hospital “poking and scratching” him in his head\nwith needles. Youth D was unable to explain what this meant. He\nwas also unable to recall the concerns he expressed to\nComplainant that triggered this investigation. He said he is not\nsure if he is currently sick, but denied having a cold, cough, or\nringworm. “I did go to the hospital after making the complaint…I\nhave had a chance to speak to the nurse here…I sleep a lot.”\nAsked if he has been mistreated at the facility, Youth D\nresponded, “I don’t know. I don’t get in trouble here. I don’t pay\n2",
    "attention.” Asked if he feels safe at the facility, he nodded\naffirmatively.\nI interviewed Therapist jointly with Government Worker 1. He said\nhe met with Youth D during his first week at the facility and Youth\nD did not have a severe cough at that time. Therapist has\nhowever observed Youth D with sleep problems, delusions,\nauditory hallucinations, responding verbally to internal stimuli, and\nshowing signs of schizophrenia. Therapist said Youth D will no\nlonger be considered for independent living due to a recent “failed”\nindependent living interview with Complainant. Youth D’s new\ndischarge plan is adult foster care.\nMedical documents reviewed:\nDischarge paperwork - Children’s Hospital 3/1/24 – Normal\nphysical\nDischarge paperwork - Beaumont Hospital 3/11/24 – Acute\npharyngitis.\nA physician-signed well-child examination dated 3/13/24\nDischarge paperwork - Beaumont Hospital 3/18/24 – Psychogenic\nparanoid psychosis\nTelepsychiatry Interview 3/20/24 – No medications prescribed.\nDischarge paperwork - Beaumont Hospital 3/23/24 – Chest pain\nDischarge paperwork Children’s Hospital 3/26/24 – Chest wall\npain\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis There is no evidence Youth D had or has ringworm and no\nevidence he did not receive timely routine or emergency medical\ncare as needed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nTitle qualifications\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Unidentified staff allegedly gave Youth D a hat known to be\ninfected with ringworm spores.\n3",
    "Investigation Interviews:\nYouth D denied having ringworm or that any staff at the facility\ngave him a hat infected with ringworm. Rather he said an\nunidentified youth at the facility teased him that he had given or\nwould give him ringworm. Youth D could not identify the youth\nwho teased him about this.\nIn terms of Youth D telling Complainant that a staff gave him a hat\ninfected with ringworm, Therapist indicated “that is definitely part\nof Youth D’s delusion. There’s no basis in reality on that.”\nAnalysis Youth D denied the allegations made by Complainant against an\nunidentified staff were true.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Unidentified staff allegedly gave Youth D's medication to an\nunidentified person.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 3/28/24 Youth D said he did not know if he is currently\nprescribed medication. He said he heard unidentified youth or\nstaff say an unknown person flushed his medication down the\ntoilet. Youth D did not know when he heard this or who said it. “I\nheard somebody gave my meds from the hospital to someone\nelse.”\nTherapist stated that hearing that someone took his medications\nand flushed them is also part of his Youth D’s delusional thought\nprocess.\nDocument reviewed:\nYouth D’s March 2024 medication log indicates he was prescribed\nan antibiotic for 7 days from 3/14 – 3/20 and Ibuprofen for 3 days\nfrom 3/26 – 3/28. Youth D refused two doses and was not offered\n4",
    "one dose of the antibiotic because he was away at the hospital.\nHe refused all doses of the Ibuprofen prescribed.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis The MAR indicates Youth D was offered an antibiotic and\nIbuprofen and either ingested or refused it. There is no evidence\nthese medications went missing, were taken by or given to\nanother person or flushed down the toilet.\nCONSULTATION\nOn 4/1/24 I recommended to Youth D’s Foster Care Worker that\nshe arrange for him to have a comprehensive psychological or\npsychiatric evaluation to determine his needs for psychotropic\nmedication and a treatment plan at the shelter as well as plan for\nan appropriate next placement as he will turn age 18 on 5/1/24.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 24, 2024\n___________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 3, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n5"
