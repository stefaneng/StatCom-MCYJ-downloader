    "The agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had 14 special investigations during this period under review, with three\ninvestigations finding rule violations. The corrective action plans addressed an\nunwarranted restraint, a staff member not following the facility's code of conduct,\nand a youth being sent home on the weekend without enough medications. The\nfacility's corrective action plan compliance is monitored quarterly, and they have\ncompleted all current corrective action plans.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on a review of the annual financial\nreport.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator reported staff turnover at the facility and now having a\nyoung group of workers that are trying to meld together. There are now two\nsupervisors, one assigned to each house, rather than one supervisor covering both\nhouses. The Chief Administrator stated this change was made to help the\nprograms be more consistent. The facility has raised the pay rate and increased\nrecruiting efforts, but staffing continues to be an issue.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe majority of the staff reported having a solid group of youth specialists working\nat the facility. Staff indicated there was a lot of turnover, but through hard work,\nmentoring and modeling from veteran staff the group is working better together.\nOne staff reported staff are not supervising youth, policies within the facility are not\nbeing followed and being fearful speaking up on these issues. An investigation into\nthis staff member's concerns is currently taking place, special investigation number\n2023C0000451.\nYouth reported in interviews feeling safe with staff, understanding the expectations\nof the house and having their needs met. One youth reported not liking the taste\nof some of the food provided but stated an alternative is provided by staff. There\nwere no concerns noted by youth interviewed.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of both houses occurred on May 10, 2023.\nThere were no issues or safety concerns noted.\n4",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules.
