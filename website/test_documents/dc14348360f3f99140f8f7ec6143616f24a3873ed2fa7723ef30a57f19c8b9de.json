    "I interviewed Staff 1 on 10/30/2023 at the facility. Staff 1 is a\nYouth Specialist. Staff 1 recalled the incident and reported he was\nin the classroom with Youth A and four other youths. He said he\ndidn’t see the incident but heard about it from Youth A. He said he\nhad was looking away when this is alleged to have happened, so\nhe didn’t see Youth B suck Youth A’s neck. He said he was\nlooking away for only a few seconds.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 10/30/2023 at the facility. Staff 2 is a\nYouth Specialist and has been working at the facility for 9 years.\nStaff 2 reported on 10/16/2023, he was in the control room outside\nthe classroom monitoring the camera and he saw Youth B walk\nover to Youth A and bend her head close to Youth A’s ear. He\nimmediately went to the classroom and told Youth B to go back to\nher seat. He did not see Youth B suck or touch Youth A’s neck.\nHe said Youth B told him that she was whispering something to\nYouth A. He said later in the evening Youth A reported that Youth\nB brushed her face against Youth A’s neck.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 10/30/2023 via telephone. Staff 3 is a\nsupervisor and has been working at the facility for 25 years. He\nreviewed the incident report written by Staff 1. He said Youth A\nand Youth B were separated after the incident and didn’t have any\ncontact.

Youth A was viewed sitting\nat a desk in the classroom with four other Youths and one staff\nmember. Each youth is sitting at a desk, and the staff member is\nsitting at the desk approximately 4 feet away from the youths.\nYouth B walks over to Youth A, who was sitting and bends down\nclose to Youth A’s ear for approximately two seconds, and then\nwalks back to her desk. Staff 2 comes in and talks to Youth B and\nYouth A.\n3",
    "Documents Reviewed:\n• Facility’s policy on Staff to resident ratio and supervision.\nThe ratio of direct care staff to youth residing in detention\nwill be a minimum of one staff to eight residents.\n• Incident report dated 10/16/2023 completed by Staff 1.\nYouth A reported Youth B made her feel uncomfortable\nbecause she thinks Youth B is gay. She reported Youth B\nkissed her on the neck.\n• Youth A was examined by the nurse on 10/17/2023 and her\nneck exam was normal; no bruises or open skin found.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is no supporting\nevidence Youth B sucked Youth A’s neck and there is no concern\nfor staff supervision.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "Rule Code & R 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements;\nSection staff qualifications.\nDescription (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 10/02/2023 staff saw Youth A naked in the shower\nInvestigation Additional allegation came in on 10/31/2023 regarding the same\nyouth. Complainant noted that a male staff member saw Youth A\nnaked in the shower. The agency had informed DCWL almost two\nweeks prior to the allegation coming in that they had been\ninformed of this concern and had already assessed the complaint.\nChief Administrator emailed DCWL Consultant on 10/19/2023 the\nfollowing:\nYouth A’s parent complained a male staff member saw her\ndaughter naked while in the shower. The young lady did not\nmake us directly aware of this, however after getting the\ncomplaint from her mother we met with her. She didn’t\nspecifically identify the employee by name, but we were\nable to pinpoint a timeframe to review cameras. I was able\nto confirm that there was a physical management a few feet\naway from the shower area. There were approximately 7-8\nemployees in/around the area, some male. I cannot confirm\nif anyone saw her naked, only that there was quite a bit of\nmovement in the area. At one point a male employee does\nwalk down the hall past the shower. However, I do not\nknow what he saw because there are walls for privacy. The\nsame employee stood in a fixed position near the showers\nfor a minute or two. To be thorough, Director and I went\nupstairs to reenact the situation (…I went in the shower and\nDirector stood where the employee was). Director could not\nsee me from that spot when I was in the shower stall and I\nwould estimate I am close to the same size as this young\nlady.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 11/15/2023 via telephone. Staff 3 recalled\non 10/02/2023, he and several staff were responding to a situation\ninvolving another Youth. Staff 3 said he walked past the shower\narea but denied seeing Youth A in shower. He reported the\nshower area has a wall, so the shower area is not visible.\n5",
    "Analysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is no supporting\nevidence that Staff 3 saw Youth A naked. The agency had\ninformed DCWL prior to the allegation coming in that they had\nbeen informed of this concern and had already assessed the\ncomplaint thoroughly. The facility completed an internal\ninvestigation and determined staff could not have possibly seen\ninto the shower area.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nNovember 30,2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 30, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
