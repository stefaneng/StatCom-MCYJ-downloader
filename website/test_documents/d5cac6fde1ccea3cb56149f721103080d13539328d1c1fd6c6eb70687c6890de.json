    "my disagreement with the Case Service Plan and\nParent Agency Treatment Plan when the\ninformation is presented to court.\nNote: If a parent or youth is unavailable or refuses to\nsign the treatment plan, the caseworker must identify,\nand document actions needed to secure the parent’s\nand/or youth’s participation in service planning and\ncompliance with the treatment plan.\nThe caseworker must obtain signatures from all applicable\nindividuals and upload the signatures pages into the\nelectronic case record within 30 days of the report date.\n1 of 4 open foster care youth case files reviewed contained one required PATP\nsignature that was not obtained timely. The late signature was located in 1 of 14\nPATPs reviewed.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nCited as FOM 722-08C, Interim 5/4/2021, CAP Approved 5/21/2021\nFOM 801-03 MEDICAL PASSPORT\nFor each child in foster care the supervising agency must\nmaintain a medical passport. Per MCL 722.954c.\nFor children entering foster care, the initial medical\npassport must be provided within two weeks of the\nchild/youth's placement date to the following\n• Foster care provider.\n• Young adult voluntary foster care (YAVFC)\nyouth/young adult re-entering foster care.\nAn updated medical passport is provided to:\n• Participating legal parents, if the child is a\ntemporary court ward.\n- Quarterly, while in out-of-home placement.\n- At reunification. Subsequent medical passports\nare not required after reunification.\n3",
    "• The child’s foster care provider:\n- At or prior to each placement.\n- Quarterly.\nAll medical information within the medical passport must\nbe current and updated at least quarterly to reflect the\nchild's current and complete health information.\nEach foster care caseworker who transfers a child's\nmedical passport to another caseworker must sign and\ndate the medical passport verifying that s/he has sought\nand obtained the necessary information under law and\nMichigan Department of Health and Human Services\n(MDHHS) policy.\nReceipt of the medical passport by the above listed\nparties is documented in MiSACWIS by uploading the\nsigned and dated signature page into the Health Profile\nsection.\n3 of 4 open foster care youth case files reviewed did not contain documentation of\nmedical passports being updated quarterly. Additionally, 1 of the 4 files contained\none required signature that was not obtained timely.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nInterim 5/4/2021, CAP Approved 5/21/2021\nRenewal 3/29/2022, CAP Approved 4/14/2022\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Ensure that when a case contact states that a document was signed during the\ncontact, the signed document is subsequently upload.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Consider adding \"paperwork reviewed/signed during visit\" to existing case\ncontact template.\n• The changes to Medical Passport policy requirements still include the quarterly\nupdated medical passport. This is documented by updating information in the\nhealth section at least quarterly then generating & saving a medical passport.\n4",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The\nagency has demonstrated overall compliance with the one CAP submitted. This\nCAP was submitted in response to the 3/29/2022 licensing renewal inspection\nreport and was approved on 4/14/2022. The agency has reduced the number of\ncitations addressed in that CAP from 7 to 2. One of the citations was repeated in\nthe 2021 interim licensing inspection; however, in 2021 the number of incidents of\nviolation was found in 3 of 6 files as opposed to the 1 in 4 files in which the\nviolation was located during the current inspection. The second citation was\nrepeated in both the 2021 & 2022 licensing inspections and the number of\nincidents of violations has remained the same; however, the nature of the violation\nhas changed overall from not obtaining required signatures, to not updating the\nmedical passports in MiSACWIS quarterly. Consultation was provided due to the\nagency needing clarification as to the requirement to update medical passports\nsince the policy changed within the period under review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was received and reviewed. The report\nprovided a thorough assessment and CAP related to agency compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nA financial audit was not required as this licensee is an MDHHS office.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed all reported receiving support and assistance from\ntheir superiors when needed. No concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have sufficient office space and equipment to perform the\nrequired job functions. The case files & CHRI records are stored securely in\ncabinets that lock in a manner that prevents unauthorized access.\n5",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMarch 20, 2023\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n______________March 20, 2023_____________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
