In\nresponse to the family notification, the facility stated that they did not have to advise\nthe family of a suicide attempt, however, an incident like this would fall under\nsubsection 1 of this rule.

    "Consultation was provided regarding employee files and the need to increase\nmonitoring and internal audits to ensure proper documentation on an ongoing basis.\nAdditionally, it is recommended that the facility maintain up to date training logs\ninstead of individually signed training forms. While the individually signed forms are\nimportant to document receipt of trainings, the cumulative trainings should be updated\non a log regularly.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period. This was investigated by both DCWL (SIR 2021C0108004) and\nDHHS and significantly contributed to the facility’s current first provisional license\nstatus. During this incident, the youth was improperly restrained and transported,\nwhich resulted in significant injuries. The CAP indicated a focus of training through\n2021 with a focus on transport. This is still ongoing at this time and will continue to be\nmonitored. The CAP outlined that one staff was terminated and two others received\nsupervision and verbal counseling. The facility was not able to provide documentation\nfor one of these counseling memorandums due to that staff’s supervisor leaving the\nfacility. This will need to be addressed by another supervisor to ensure compliance\nwith the CAP. Ongoing supervision of the two employees has been informal per the\nDirector. Monthly unannounced onsite visits have occurred, and youth have not\nreported any excessive, aggressive, or physical methods of discipline or punishment.\nRestraints are reported to be done appropriately by the youth.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period. This was investigated by DCWL in Special Investigation\n2021C0201024, and the facility was cited for use of corporal punishment as\ndiscipline. Staff retraining was outlined in the CAP. Verification of the trainings will\noccur in June 2021 to allow the facility time to provide the documentation. Monthly\nunannounced onsite visits have occurred, and youth have not reported any\nexcessive, unjustified, aggressive, or physical methods of discipline or punishment.\nRestraints are reported to be done appropriately per the youth.\nThe facility has submitted seven acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period. This provisional review period found\nthe following special investigations were completed, requiring CAPs.\n 2021C0219022: This investigation cited R 127(2) Staff to resident ratio. The\nfacility submitted a CAP and ratio has been monitored ongoing during monthly\nonsite visits. The facility has been found in compliance with the rule and their\nCAP.\n 2021C0201024: A summary of this investigation is noted above related to use\nof corporal punishment.\n 2021C0201016: This investigation cited R 126 Sufficiency of Staff due to a\nyouth being repeatedly hit by peers with staff on duty. This occurred over time\n10",
    "and on different Pods. It was concluded that the staff was not providing for the\nprotection and supervision of this youth. The facility submitted a CAP included\nplans for maintaining ratios and for increased quarterly training of staff. This\nCAP will continue to be monitored as it was just implemented in March 2021.\nDuring monthly unannounced visits, the facility has been compliant with ratio\nand no youth have reported any safety related concerns.\n 2021C0108025: This investigation cited R 109(1)(c) for not following their own\npolicy related to incident reporting. In this case, a youth attempted suicide and\nthe facility staff did not write an incident report before leaving their shift. The\nCAP indicated staff retraining. This will be monitored for compliance in June\n2021 to allow the facility time to provide documentation for verification of\ncompletion.\n 2021C0108010: This investigation found the facility in noncompliance of R\n407(1) as a youth was in a bedroom with a malfunctioning lock. The issue was\nknown to the staff and therapist, but the youth remained in the room. The\nfacility CAP noted that youth will not be permitted to remain in rooms with\nmalfunctioning locks, and maintenance issues will be discussed during\nmeetings, and maintenance request forms will be readily available to staff. The\nfacility was not compliant with this CAP as another investigation,\n2021C0103016, found youth and staff knew that youth could “pop” open some\nbedrooms on Pod H and youth remained in those rooms. This resulted in the\nfacility being recommended for a second provisional license as outlined below.\n 2021C0108005: This investigation cited R 127(2) for noncompliance with ratio,\nand R 159(2) for a resident restraining other youth to protect the one staff on\nshift. The facility submitted a CAP and ratio has been monitored ongoing\nduring monthly onsite visits. The facility has been found in compliance with the\nrule and their CAP for ratio.\n 2021C0108004: A summary of this investigation is noted above related to\nsubstantiated child abuse/neglect. A first provisional license was implemented\nafter this investigation.\nIt is notable that there are currently two completed investigations, 2021C0103018 and\n2021C0103016, with pending CAPs. Both investigations have violations and have\nresulted in the facility being recommended for a Second Provisional License. SIR\n2021C0103016 had violations for R 109(1)(c) due to staff sleeping during shift, R\n112(4) as the staff knew youth could “pop” bedroom locks open and did not ensure\nsafety and supervision, and a violation of R 407(1) related to the bedroom locks on\nPod H being able to be “popped” open by youth which creates a significant security\nand safety risk. SIR 2021C0103018 cited the facility for R 109(1)(c) for not following\ntheir policy on suicide precautions. This is a similar citation as 2021C0108025 as a\nyouth attempted suicide by wrapping a shirt around his neck and the staff had to\nphysically remove it. This staff did not document the incident on an incident report.\n11",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, I continue to recommend that the agency license\nbe modified to a Second Provisional license as recommended in Special Investigation\nReport 2021C0103016.\nJune 11, 2021, amended 07/21/2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 14, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n12"
