    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance:\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nSpecial Investigation #2024SIC0001751, dated 11/24/2024, CAP approved on\n12/30/2024. The allegations involved home visits in the caregiver’s home and no\nhome visit sheets were completed and signed. The agency was found in violation\nwith CPA Rule 400.12202 (1) and three additional rules, 400.12207 (3), 400.12418\n(2) (b) and 400.12418 (5). The agency was found in repeat violations during this\nreporting period in their renewal inspection of 400.12418 (2) (b) and 400.12418\n(5). The agency has put forth efforts to correct these violations.\nThe agency interim inspection was completed on 12/6/2024, and the CAP was\napproved on 3/7/2025. The agency was found in violations with six CPA rules.\nThere is one rule that is a repeat violation for this reporting period, Rule 400.12418\n(2) (b). More effort is needed to correct this violation.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nChief Administrator (CA) discussed barriers that impeded the agency this year\nduring the onsite inspection. The CA reported during this reporting period, there\nwas a restructuring, which included transition of staff, including chief\nadministrator/director and program managers. There were some layoffs and other\nstaff transitioned to different supervisors. These changes have been a challenge\nfor staff, which affected staff retention. CA reported the CAP allowed the team to\nreview how to more effectively track due dates. The caseworkers are using their\nBook of Business reports more and supervisors are reviewing them weekly with\ntheir teams. Supervisors are meeting with their teams weekly to discuss what is\ndue and any potential barriers to completing their work timely.\nFinancial Overview:\nThe independent agency auditor’s report dated December 31, 2023, and the\nagency annual financial report was reviewed. There were no financial concerns\nidentified.\nStaff Interviews:\nStaff interviewed reported they get the assistance and support they need from\ntheir coworkers on their teams and supervisors. Staff reported if they could\nchange anything about the program it would be to hire more case aides and to\nhave meetings with other programs within the agency to get to know their\ncoworkers and have more cohesiveness with one another.",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through:\nThe agency has the space and equipment needed to fulfil job requirements. The\nfiles are stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS:\nThere were three safety alerts.\nSafety Alert 1:\nConcern: Caregiver did not have an operable smoke detector on each level of\noccupancy and/or near all sleeping areas.\nResolution: The caregiver already had the smoke detector in her possession.\nThe agency caseworker assisted the caregiver in getting the smoke detector\ninstalled on 7/2/2025 and the home is in compliance.\nSafety Alert 2:\nConcern: Caregiver did not have an operable smoke detector near all sleeping\nareas.\nResolution: A smoke detector was installed in the area that was cut off when\nthe hall door closes. There are now two smoke detectors between the\nbedrooms and the rest of the home. The smoke detector was placed adjacent\nto the light fixture that was shown in the safety alert. The home is now in\ncompliance with all licensing rules.\nSafety Alert 3:\nConcern: Caregiver had no operable smoke detector on each level of\noccupancy and/or near all sleeping areas. There was no operable carbon\nmonoxide detector in the home. The boiler room is being used as a bedroom\nfor one of the youth in the home and the room is occupied by the water heater,\nwasher and dryer.\nResolution: On 7/3/2025, the Licensing Supervisor discussed the current safety\nplan regarding the sexualized behaviors of the youths in the home and new\nbedroom arrangements were developed. The caregiver will now be sleeping\non the couch, one youth will be sleeping in the caregiver’s bedroom and the other\nyouth will be sleeping in the other room that was for the two youths. It was\ndiscussed that it was inappropriate for the youths to share a sleeping space.\nThe space that previously held a bed in the laundry room area will now be\nused for storage. Three dual smoke and carbon detectors were provided by\nthe agency and installed by the caregiver. Caregiver’s home is in compliance\nwith licensing requirements.",
