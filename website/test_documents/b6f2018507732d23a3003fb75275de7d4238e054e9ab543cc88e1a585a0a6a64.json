Allegations were discussed as well as\ndocumentation that is needed. Administrator 1 reported that Youth A is refusing some\naspects of the “safety plan”; therefore, placing himself in unsafe situations.

Staff at the facility\nasked him to go to another building while they worked this out and he refused.\nAdministrator 1 reported Youth A was placed at the facility on 1/6/22. Since then, he has\nbeen in two altercations with different youth, AWOLed, and has attempted to self-harm.\nAdministrator 1 reported they have put in a “safety plan” and 15 Minute Observations to\nkeep him safe. Administrator 1 reported that Youth A has not been compliant with all\naspects of the safety plan and has verbalized he doesn’t feel safe but has not provided\nany detail to why he doesn’t feel safe. Administrator 1 reported he has not been given\nany information alleging that Youth A has been bullied or threatened by the peers who\nattacked him.\n2",
    "I reviewed the following documents throughout the course of the investigation:\n Safety Plan\n Face Sheet\n Incident reports\n 15 Minute Observation Sheets\nI reviewed the Incident Report dated 1/9/22. The incident occurred at 8:45pm. Youth A\nwas eating in the dining area of the dorm when three youth ran at him and attacked him.\nStaff that were present and additional staff were called into the dorm to break up the\nfight. Youth A was assessed for injuries and had swelling on his left and right cheek\nareas. Youth A refused medical attention. Police were contacted and Youth A was\nremoved to the other dorm for the night. Youth A w as seen on 1/10/22 by Clinical\nDirector to ensure there were no injuries. Youth A reported that he was not injured.\nI reviewed the “safety plan” on 1/19/22. The safety plan outlines Youth A to remain near\nstaff and to move around with the staff while in the unit. Youth A’s bed has been moved\nto be closer to staff. Midnight staff will position themselves closer to Youth A’s bed and\nany bullying or verbal threats will be immediately reported to the therapist and program\nsupervisor. The “safety plan” was created on 1/11/22.\n**It is to be noted that Youth A has refused to sign the safety plan. This is noted on the\nsafety plan dated 1/11/22.\nI reviewed the Incident Report dated 1/12/22. Youth A AWOLed from the facility and\nwas returned by the police. Youth A did not have any injuries.\nI reviewed the 15 Minute Observation Sheets that were completed on 1/10/22-present\nday (1/19/22). Staff documented Youth A’s whereabouts and actions every 15 minutes.\nI reviewed the Incident Report dated 1/16/22. Youth A attempted to hurt himself by\nwrapping his robe around his neck and around his rack area on his bed. Staff were\npresent and took the clothing item from Youth A. Staff called 911 and notified supervisor\nimmediately. A follow up meeting with Youth A and the site supervisor occurred on\n1/17/22. 15-minute watches were to continue. A follow up meeting with Clinical Director\nand Youth A occurred on 1/17/22 and the same outcome occurred.\nI reviewed the Medical Appointment/Urgent Care Form. Youth A was seen by the\nMcClaren Oakland on 1/16/22 at 10:15pm. Follow up was to occur with counselor and\nmonitoring for behavior changes.\nI reviewed the Incident Report dated 1/17/22. Youth A was in an altercation with another\npeer over a t-shirt at 6:30pm. Youth A refused accountability and refused his safety\nplan, going to another building for the night. At 8:40pm that night, that same peer\n3",
    "attacked Youth A and they were in another altercation. Youth A continued to refuse his\n“safety plan”. Youth A would not go to the other building for the evening.\nAll interviews were conducted face to face at the facility on 1/21/22.\nThe dorm area is separated by two doors. There is a bed area and then a “front” area\nwith the kitchen and living area. Youth A was in the kitchen area eating a snack. The\nother three peers were in the bed area.\nI interviewed Youth A. Youth A reported that the youths pushed past a female staff and\nattacked him. Youth A reported there were four staff in the dorm at the time of the\nincident. Youth A reported there were two staff in the “front area” with him and other\npeers. There were two staff at each door that was separating the front and back areas.\nThe three-youths pushed past the staff at the door and started to attack him. Youth A\nreported that two more staff were called into the dorm to help. Youth A reported he felt\nthat staff sat back and watched him get hurt. Youth A did report three staff did help\nremove the other peers off him though. Youth A reported that after this incident those\nthree peers have stated disrespectful comments to him. Youth A reported they have not\nthreatened him. Youth A reported he does not believe that the safety plan will keep him\nsafe because he feels that he already must be in the line of sight of staff. Youth A\nreported he was unsure what staff could do to keep him safe. Youth A reported there\nare always two staff on shift. Youth A reported that due to his truancy, he must remove\nhis outside clothes when in the door and put his shoes up. Youth A reported he truanted\nbecause he felt unsafe. Youth A reported he said he was going to hurt himself because\nhe was frustrated with no one helping him.\nI interviewed Therapist 1. Therapist 1 reported she usually sees the youth once a week\nbut has seen Youth A more than once per week due to the current issues. Therapist 1\nreported she completed the “safety plan” with Youth A and he refused to sign it.\nTherapist 1 reported Youth A understands the plan but just felt it wasn’t going to work\nso didn’t sign it. Therapist 1 reported that Youth A was asked to go to another unit for a\nnight and he refused to do so. Therapist 1 reported she has provided this information to\nYouth A’s mother as well. Therapist 1 reported all the youth in the incident have been\naddressed. Therapist 1 reported the three other youth involved have accepted\nresponsibility and have done well over the last week. Youth A has not moved on from\nthis incident, but is still being involved in other incidents, including AWOL, self-harm,\nand physical altercation. Therapist 1 reported that she has seen Youth A playing Uno\nwith one of the peers who attacked him. Therapist 1 reported she has not been given\nany information that the three youth are bullying or threatening Youth A in any way\nsince the attack. Therapist 1 reported Youth A stated he ran away because he was\nfrustrated with other peers taking too long marching outside; therefore, the unit had to\nwait for those peers to catch up in line. Therapist 1 reported that Youth A reported to\nher that he tried to hurt himself because he doesn’t get enough phone calls.\nI interviewed Staff 1. Staff 1 reported there is a “safety plan” in place for Youth A. Staff1\nknew the safety plan. Staff 1 reported there was one “passive aggressive” comment\n4",
    "made by one of the three youth after the incident and this was redirected. Staff 1\nreported he has not heard any comments since then. Staff 1 reported Youth A has not\ntold him about any threats. Staff 1 reported the unit is usually broken into two units.\nYouth A is not with the other three youth.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1. Supervisor 1 reported she was involved in the incident on\n1/9/22. Supervisor 1 reported that units were divided and the three youth in the\nbedroom were trying to get up front to Youth A. There were two staff stationed at the\ndoors and one of the youths did push past one of the staff in the doorway to attack\nYouth A. Supervisor1 reported there were three staff in the unit and two more came in\nafter they called for assistance. Supervisor 1 reported that two of the staff removed the\nyouths from Youth A and a peer grabbed another youth without being asked to help.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A stated he had no injuries, although his cheeks were red.\nSupervisor 1 reported they called the police and Youth A refused to press charges.\nSupervisor 1 reported neither staff or Youth A has not told her that anyone has\nthreatened or bullied him since the incident. Supervisor 1 reported there is a “safety\nplan” in place and Youth A does not always follow it. Youth A has refused to go to the\nother unit for safety and to stay arm’s length with staff. Supervisor 1 reported they even\ncalled Youth A’s mother to attempt to have him listen to her, but that did not work.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand\nprocedures that describe the institution’s behavior\nmanagement system. The policies and procedures shall be\nreviewed annually and updated as needed. These shall be\navailable to all residents, their families, and referring\nagencies.\nANALYSIS: The facility put a safety plan into place after the incident on\n1/9/22. Staff and supervision are aware of the safety plan and\nare documenting 15-minute observations. Therapist 1 has seen\nYouth A on more occasions than the once per week session to\nprovide support to Youth A. Youth A has refused parts of the\nsafety plan, but the agency has done their due diligence in\ncreating an environment where Youth A can be safe.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n5",
