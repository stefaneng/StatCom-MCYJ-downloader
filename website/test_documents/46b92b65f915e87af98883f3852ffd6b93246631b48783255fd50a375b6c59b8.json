He reported there was a\nconcern with Staff 1 not completing the restraint correctly, as is\ntaught in the CPI protocol. Administrator reported he saw for a few\nseconds that Staff 1 had his hands near Youth A’s neck, and it\nappeared to be a choke hold. He reported Staff 2 had stepped in\nwithin a few seconds and told Staff 1 that it was incorrect\npositioning. Administrator reported Staff 1 stepped out of the\nsituation and took full responsibility for completing the hold\nincorrectly. He reported that from talking to staff on shift, it\nappeared Staff 1 had no ill intent and just had the wrong\npositioning. Administrator reported whenever there is a restraint at\nthe facility, the supervisor on shift will review the video with the\nstaff, and then he will review the video with the supervisor. He\nreported the facility is well invested in reviewing all their restraints\nand where they can learn to perform better.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nSeptember 30, 2025. Youth A reported he feels safe at the facility\nand identifies Staff 1 as his most supportive staff member.\nConsultant noticed Youth A’s hand was bandaged up and asked\nYouth A what occurred.

Consultant asked Youth A to explain more\nabout what happened that day. He reported he became upset with\nYouth B over a deck of cards and wanted to fight Youth B. Youth\nA reported Staff 1 encouraged Youth A to make better choices\n2",
    "and not to fight Youth B. He reported Staff 1 encouraged him to go\noutside to take a walk to help calm him down, and Youth A\nreported he refused to do that. Youth A reported staff attempted to\nrestrain him because when he was trying to get to Youth B’s\nbedroom, staff were blocking him, and he was assaulting the staff.\nHe reported he does not remember much, but remembers he tried\nto choke Staff 1 and pushed Staff 2. When asked about the\nattempted restraint hold, Youth A explained the staff on shift did\neverything appropriate, and he had no concerns about their\nactions. He denied getting harmed by any of the staff. Youth A\nreported staff tried to redirect him, but he did not listen and next\ntime he needs to learn to just walk away.\nYouth B was not interviewed as he was not a witness to the\nrestraint and was only involved as he was the target that\nYouth A wanted to fight.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nSeptember 30, 2025. Youth C reported he likes living at the\nfacility and feels safe here. He reported he sat in the milieu area\nwhen Youth A was getting restrained on September 27, 2025.\nYouth C reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 tried to verbally de-escalate\nYouth A to calm him down as he was upset with Youth B. He\nreported Staff 1 and Staff 2 ended up restraining Youth A because\nYouth A had pushed Staff 2 and was becoming physically\naggressive. Youth C reported staff only restrain a youth when they\nare being physically assaultive towards others or trying to harm\nthemselves. He reported he saw no concerns with the restraint\nand stated the staff members involved acted appropriately.

He\nreported at one point, Youth A attempted to get into Youth B’s\nroom, and Staff 2 and Staff 3 stood in the space blocking Youth A.\n3",
    "Staff 1 reported this upset Youth A, which resulted in him\nbecoming physical towards Staff 2. He reported that through this\nwhole situation, there were a couple of occasions he went into a\nrestraint with Youth A due to assaultive behaviors. Staff 1 reported\nhe could not remember the specific order of what occurred. He\nreported he remembered that in one restraint, Youth A had\ndropped his body weight, and before Staff 1 could release him,\nYouth A had brought Staff 1 to the ground with him. Staff 1\nreported while on the ground, Youth A tried to kick and grab Staff\n1’s neck. He reported within another restraint; Youth A had\nassaulted Staff 2 and was able to break his arm free from the\nrestraint. Staff 1 reported Youth A then put Staff 1 into a headlock\nwith his released arm, which was causing Staff 1 issues with his\nbreathing. He reported Staff 2 was able to get Youth A’s arm\nremoved, and while Staff 1 was repositioning his hold on Youth A\nthat Staff 1 put his own arm around Youth A’s head. Staff 1\nreported he knew that was not appropriate, and Staff 2 also called\nthis out. He reported within a minute, he released and stepped out\nof the hold.

He reported Youth\nA has a known history of attempting to choke people as his form\nof physical aggression. Staff 1 reported he attempted all his\ntechniques to try to calm Youth A down, but Youth A was in his\ntunnel vision. He reported Youth A was able to process with him\nover the situation, and Youth A broke down in tears about this\nsituation. Staff 1 reported he suffers from asthma, so when Youth\nA had him in that choke hold, he was also struggling to breathe,\nand when he stepped out of the hold, he had an asthma attack.\nHe reported he used to be a corrections officer and came to the\nfacility to try to help these youth not end up in that type of system.\nStaff 1 reported the facility does a great job with communicating\nwhat is going on with the youth’s treatment plan, their history, their\ntriggers, and ways to de-escalate the youth. He reported even\nafter any restraints that occur, the team involved will review the\nvideo footage with the supervisor to see where they can learn to\ndo things better and see what went well in the situation.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nSeptember 30, 2025. Staff 2 reported on September 27, 2025,\nYouth A was trying to fight Youth B over some type of playing\ncards. She reported when Youth A and Youth B got into a verbal\nargument, Staff 1 and Staff 2 tried to separate the youth by giving\nthem the choice to walk around outside or go to the gym. Staff 2\nreported Youth B chose to go into his room to spend some time,\nand Youth A stayed in the milieu area. She reported Youth A\ncontinued to pace around the milieu and appeared to be frustrated\n4",
    "with Youth B as he was continuing to swear at Youth B. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 tried to intervene and encouraged Youth A to go\ntake a walk outside, but he continued to refuse. Staff 2 reported\nthe staff allowed Youth A to have some space and continue to\nwalk around the milieu. After about ten minutes, Supervisor\nentered the building with some other youth. She reported\nSupervisor tried to verbally de-escalate Youth A, which did not\nwork. Staff 2 reported Youth A then went towards Youth B’s\nbedroom. She reported herself and Staff 3 positioned themselves\nat the doorway using proxemics to prevent Youth A from entering\nthe room. This escalated Youth A further, and he attempted to\npush past staff while making physical threats. Staff 2 reported she\ninitiated a restraint with Staff 1. She reported they attempted to do\na standing hold, but Youth A was able to get out of the hold. Staff\n2 reported Youth A then hit her when he was released. She\nreported Staff 1 then re-engaged with Youth A in a one-person\nstanding hold, but Youth A dropped his weight to the floor, which\nbrought Staff 1 to the floor with him. Staff 2 reported she was the\nsupport staff within this situation and helped them both get up.\nShe reported Youth A was still attempting to get into Youth B’s\nbedroom. Staff 2 reported Staff 3 did try to encourage Youth B to\nmove out of his room, but he refused. She reported Youth B’s\nroommate, Youth C, did leave the room and sat in the milieu area.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A then punched the bookshelf a couple of\ntimes.

Staff\n2 reported within a minute, she redirected Staff 1 to move his arm,\nand Staff 1 ended up tapping out of the situation. She reported\nthey were disengaged from the situation, and Youth A was able to\neventually calm down and process with Staff 1 per his request.\nStaff 2 reported they attempted to do everything they could to\nprevent the restraint from occurring. She reported Staff 1 followed\nher redirect immediately, as he was doing the hold improperly.\nStaff 2 reported Supervisor and Staff 3 did provide assistance with\nthe situation and helped monitor the other youth who were in the\nunit.\n5",
    "Supervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nSeptember 30, 2025. Supervisor reported on September 27,\n2025, she was returning from the dining hall with a couple of other\nyouth and could see that Youth A was getting escalated. She\nreported Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 were all present on the milieu\narea, trying to work with Youth A. Supervisor reported Staff 1 was\ngiving Youth A the option to go outside to go for a walk to calm\ndown, but Youth A refused that suggestion. She reported Youth A\nwas very upset with Youth B and was attempting to physically fight\nhim. Supervisor reported Youth A kept yelling and swearing at the\nstaff in the milieu. She reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 blocked Youth\nA from going into Youth B’s bedroom. Supervisor reported when\nYouth A pushed Staff 2 multiple times, that is when Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 tried to complete a two-person standing restraint with\nYouth A. Supervisor reported during that time, she continued to\nwatch the situation but also complete check-ins on the other youth\nthat had gone to their rooms. She reported Youth C came out into\nthe milieu during this time. Supervisor reported Staff 3 was\nmonitoring the restraint as well. She reported at one point; Youth\nA was able to drop his body weight and bring Staff 1 to the floor.\nSupervisor reported at this point, she went over to assist in the\nsituation and saw that Youth A was trying to do a choke hold\naround Staff 1’s neck. She reported Staff 1 was able to get away,\nand Youth A got off the floor. Staff continued to try to verbally de-\nescalate the situation and give Youth A space. Supervisor\nreported Youth A then punched the bookshelf multiple times. She\nreported after he punched the bookshelf, he tried to get into Youth\nB’s room again, but Staff 1 and Staff 2 blocked him from going into\nthe room. Supervisor reported during that time, she continued to\nwatch and coach the situation, which Staff 3 did check ins with the\nother youth. She reported Youth A then tried to hit Staff 2, which\nresulted in Staff 1 and Staff 2 attempting to get Youth A into a\nstanding restraint. Supervisor reported Staff 3 also joined to assist\nthe other staff. She reported within that hold, Youth A was able to\nget his arm free and put his arm around Staff 1’s neck and put him\nin a headlock. Supervisor reported Staff 2 was able to get Youth\nA’s arm off of Staff 1’s neck. She reported at one point, Staff 1 did\nput his arm around Youth A’s neck, but Staff 2 redirected him, and\nin less than two minutes, Staff 1 released and stepped away from\nthe situation. Supervisor reported Youth A was released and\ncontinued to walk around. She reported Youth A finally de-\nescalated from the situation and started to cry due to feeling\nremorse for the situation. Supervisor reported Youth A processed\nwith Staff 1 as Youth A requested to talk with him. She reported\nStaff 1 did a great job of stepping out of the situation as soon as\nhe was in an inappropriate hold. Supervisor reported after the\n6",
    "situation, she was able to get Youth A medical attention for\npunching the bookcase. She reported she had also reviewed the\nvideo footage with Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 to process the\nsituation. Supervisor reported she also reviewed the video footage\nand processed the situation right away with Administrator.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on October 7, 2025. Staff 3\nreported that on September 27, 2025, Youth A was upset with\nYouth B. She reported Staff 1 was attempting to redirect Youth A\naway from Youth B’s room because Youth A was threatening to\nfight Youth B. Staff 3 reported Youth A continued to ignore the\nredirects and became more physically violent towards staff. She\nreported she walked away to check in on the other youth on the\nunit. Staff 3 reported when she walked back into the main area,\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were going into a restraint with Youth A. She\nreported she stepped in at one moment to help Staff 2 get Youth A\ninto the proper hold. Staff 3 reported she witnessed Youth A put\nhis arm around Staff 1’s neck in what appeared to be a choke hold\nposition. She reported Staff 2 assisted with getting Youth A’s arm\noff of Staff 1’s neck. Staff 3 reported after this situation occurred;\nshe witnessed Staff 1 put his arm around Youth A’s neck. She\nreported Staff 2 redirected Staff 1 immediately that this was an\nincorrect hold and Staff 1 disengaged and stepped away\nimmediately from the situation. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 and Staff 2\nfollowed all the protocol they are trained on to help avoid a\nrestraint. She reported the only issue with this restraint was Staff 1\nplacing his arm around Youth A’s neck, but he was completely\ndisengaged when prompted. Staff 3 reported she has never seen\nany concerns with Staff 1 and Staff 2’s interactions with the youth\nat the facility.\nVideo Recording:\nVideo recording of September 27, 2025, of the main milieu area\nwas reviewed by this consultant with Administrator during the\nonsite visit at the facility on September 30, 2025. The video\nfootage shows Youth A was in the main area continuously walking\naround. Staff 1 and Staff 2 are seen talking to Youth A, but there is\nno sound to the video to hear what they are saying. Youth A\ncontinued to try to walk up to the bedroom door area, which\nAdministrator pointed out was Youth B’s bedroom. The video could\nnot be zoomed in to see exactly what was happening as the bedroom\narea was in the corner of the screen. The video does show Staff 2\nand Staff 3 going over to the area with Youth A, while Staff 1 stood\nback. Youth C was also sitting in the milieu area and Supervisor was\nchecking in on the other youth. The video footage is not fully clear as\nthere was what appeared to be a restraint hold that occurred near the\ncorner of the video that is also near the bathroom area of the room.\n7",
    "Staff 1 is seen engaging in an appropriate one person hold with\nYouth A but then Staff 2 stepped in front of the hold and blocked the\nvideo camera. Youth A is seen getting up off the floor and punching\nthe bookshelf. All the staff are seen giving Youth A space from this\narea. Youth A is seen going towards the bedroom area again and\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 intervene. They then end up in another restraint\ntowards the wall area. Again, due to the angle of the video the full\nsituation could not be seen. Staff 3 does walk up to the hold for\nassistance. It is seen in the video Youth A getting his arm free and\nplacing it over Staff 1’s neck like a choke hold position. Staff 2 is\nseen taking Youth A’s arm off of Staff 1’s neck. Staff 1 is seen\nrepositioning, and his arm is up towards Youth A’s neck. Then it is\nseen Staff 1 stepping out from the hold. Youth A is then released and\nwalks out of the view of the camera.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n- MiSACWIS Restraint Report 220480265- This report is\nconsistent with the details of the restraints that occurred per\nthe interviews with Staff 1, Staff 2, and Supervisor.\n- Staff 1’s Human Resource File- Staff 1 has been\nemployed with the facility since 09/30/2024. He has no\ndisciplinary actions noted within his HR file. Staff 1 is up to\ndate on all required training. He completed the facility’s\nrestraint model training on 10/23/2024 and most recent\nrefresher training was on 01/25/2025\n- Facility’s Behavior Management Philosophy and\nProcedures- Within this policy it notes that the facility\nfollows the Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) model. The\npolicy notes that any physical behavior management\nintervention will be used as a last resort and after\nnonphysical techniques are exhausted. To promote safety\na team approach is always best practice. Which per this\nincident appears to be followed. The policy also notes that\nstaff cannot utilize physical management to address\nbehavioral issues, only if there is an unanticipated or\nsevere threat of danger to an individual. Within this incident\nstaff and youth all indicated Youth A was attempting to\nphysically attack Youth B.\n- Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) Model – There are no\nholds approved by this model that would allow a staff\nmember to place their hand/arm near a youth’s neck.\n8",
    "Analysis The facility is found in noncompliance with the rule as it was found\nwithin interviews and video review that Staff 1 did not perform a\nrestraint on Youth A in an approved, safe manner. It was found\nthat Staff 1 did place his arm around Youth A’s neck for a short\nperiod of time, which is not a safe restraint technique. It should be\nnoted that Staff 2 noticed Staff 1’s hold was inappropriate and\nredirected him right away. Staff 1 immediately disengaged the\nunsafe hold and stepped away from the situation.\nTechnical Assistance\nWhen reviewing the facility’s behavior management policy that the\nsection for prohibited techniques does not address all the points\noutlined within state licensing rule R400.4158 (1) (a) (i-v). This\nconsultant provided technical assistance to the facility to update\ntheir policy to incorporate all prohibited techniques that are noted\nin the licensing rule.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nOctober 13, 2025\n____________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 15, 2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n9"
