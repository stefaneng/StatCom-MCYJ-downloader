    "ANALYSIS: The facility is found in compliance as interviews with youth and\nstaff do not support the allegations of staff pinching, leaving\nbruises or twisting Youth A’s arm during restraints.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe facility was reminded to describe the actions of the youth in\nincident reports that warranted the restraint. The final rule\nrestraint and seclusion rules that took effect May 31, 2022 was\ndiscussed and reviewed with Chief Administrator and\nAdministrator.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nYouth was placed in a restraint for spitting at staff.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed incident reports that involved Youth A from June 1 – June 15, 2022, when\nthe special investigation was assigned due to the broad allegations and not having a\nspecific day or restraint identified. In reviewing those restraints, I read incident\nreport 137590194 that indicated Youth A was restrained for spitting on Staff 3.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face on June 24, 2022, in collaboration with\nDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported he restrained Youth A because Youth A was trying\nto spit on staff. Staff 3 stated when a youth spits that it is “grounds for a restraint,\ndue to it being an assault.” Staff 3 stated, “you don’t have to restrain but you can.”\nStaff 3 is a trainer in Safe Crisis Management.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Incident Report\n137590194 described Youth A being restrained for trying to spit on Staff 3.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4160 Emergency restraint.\nRule 160. The use of emergency restraint as a lifesaving\nresponse for a youth will be limited to:\n(a) An emergency response to protect the youth or others\nfrom an unanticipated or severely aggressive behavior that\nplaces the youth or others at serious threat of violence or\ninjury if no immediate intervention occurs.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in noncompliance as Youth A was\nrestrained for spitting at Staff 3.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR2022C0116037 dated 7/5/22; CAP not due until 7/20/22\n5",
