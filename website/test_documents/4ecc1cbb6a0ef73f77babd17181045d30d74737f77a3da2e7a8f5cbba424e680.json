Staff 2 recalled\nYouth A trying to fight back at Youth B, and he was concerned\nthat if things escalated Youth A would be injured by Youth B. Staff\n2 recalled accidently leaning into the wall while holding Youth A’s\narms behind him, and in doing so he was able to gain more\nphysical control of the situation. Staff 2 did not believe that Youth\nA’s head ever touched the wall, and he denied slamming Youth A\ninto the wall. Staff 2 escorted Youth A to his bedroom and in the\nprocess Youth A was resisting. Staff 2 then moved Youth A into\nhis room and Youth A tried to run back out, so he was restrained\nagain.

The\nfootage did not present a perfectly clear representation of\nthe incident because of some inadvertent glitches. What\ncould be seen was the immediate aftermath of Youth B\nassaulting Youth A upon Youth A entering the pod. Staff\ncould be seen intervening with Youth B, and at the same\ntime Staff 2 attempted to restrain Youth A. Staff 2 utilized a\none person restraint hold where he held Youth A’s arms\nbehind his body. Youth A and Staff 2 came into contact\n4",
    "with the wall, but it could not be determined if Youth A’s\nface hit the wall as well. Youth A was then escorted to his\nroom by Staff 2, and it appeared that Youth A resisted and\nstruggled while this occurred. It was confirmed that no\nother camera angle existed that would have provided a\nbetter view inside of Youth A’s room.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Incident report documentation dated 10/19/2024 was\nprovided and reviewed. This document outlined similar\ndetails of the incident as were provided in interviews with\nyouth and staff.\n• Facility medical notes dated 10/19/2024 were provided and\nreviewed.

The nurse that completed the medical\ndocumentation noted that he had a bruise on the front side\nof his shoulder. No facial injuries or bruising were noted\nand no other injuries were noted.\n• Documentation of the facility’s approved restraint model,\nMANDT, was provided and reviewed. Of the approved\nrestraint holds included a one person restraint titled “Two\nArm Hold” where a staff member holds a youths arms from\nbehind them.
