She reported receiving an email Friday, 4/26/2024\nfrom a person supervising Youth A’s parental visitation with\nphotos of injuries on Youth A’s arms and face. Foster Care\nWorker stated she did not see the email until the following\nMonday, 4/29/2024 at which time she forwarded the email and\nphotos to Foster Care Supervisor. Foster Care Worker reported\nmeeting with Foster Care Supervisor the same day for supervision\nduring which Foster Care Supervisor told Foster Care Worker she\nwas going to consult with her colleagues about the photos and\nhow to proceed. Foster Care Worker didn’t hear anything further\nuntil she met with Foster Care Supervisor the following week.\nDuring that meeting Foster Care Supervisor asked Foster Care\nWorker if she had followed up with Caregiver to find out if she\nknew the cause of the injuries as she told her to do. Foster Care\nWorker had not done so and did not recall Foster Care Supervisor\ntelling her to. At that time, Foster Care Supervisor advised Foster\nCare Worker to report the injuries to MDHHS. Foster Care Worker\nacknowledged that she should have reported the injuries as soon\nas she saw the photos instead of waiting on her supervisor to\nconsult with colleagues.\n2",
    "Foster Care Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing\non 5/23/2024. She reported she reviewed the email forwarded by\nFoster Care Worker and the photos of the injuries on Youth A on\n4/29/2024. She stated she was the worker on the case previously\nand she did not have any concerns with Caregiver. She stated\nYouth A has had hand, foot and mouth disease a couple of times\nand has had bad bug bites, so the photos didn’t alarm her. She\nstated she had supervision with Foster Care Worker on 5/1/2024\nat which time Foster Care Worker asked if she had seen the\nphotos of Youth A. They looked at the photos together and Foster\nCare Supervisor told Foster Care Worker she was going to get a\nsecond opinion on the photos and would follow up with her after.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated it crossed her mind to have Foster\nCare Worker report the injuries to MDHHS, but she never said it\nout loud. Foster Care Supervisor stated she consulted with a co-\nworker as well as a MDHHS staff member about the photos. She\nstated the coworker advised her to ask Caregiver if she knew\nanything about the marks. MDHHS worker told her to “maybe call\nit in.” Foster Care Worker reached out to Foster Care Supervisor\non 5/7/2024 asking if she had gotten the second opinion at which\ntime Foster Care Supervisor asked Foster Care Worker if she had\nfollowed up with the Caregiver. Foster Care Worker had not, so\nFoster Care Supervisor advised her to report the injuries to\nMDHHS which she did on 5/8/2024, a week and a half after the\nphotos were initially reviewed. Foster Care Supervisor stated she\nmade a “rookie mistake” and misguided Foster Care Worker by\ntelling her to wait to report the injuries. Foster Care Supervisor\nstated the agency policy is to not investigate such concerns,\nrather to report the concerns to MDHHS. Foster Care Supervisor\nstated Caregiver has been doing well up to this point, so she\ndecided to check with her before reporting the injuries.\nMDHHS Worker was interviewed by phone on 5/17/2024 and\n5/24/2024. MDHHS Worker stated a medical examination was\ncompleted on Youth A and pictures of the injuries were shown to\nthe physician; however, due to there being a delay and the injuries\nhaving been mostly healed, the cause of injury could not be\ndetermined. She reported she spoke with Foster Care Supervisor\nwho apologized for not reporting the injuries of Youth A timely.\nMDHHS Worker stated no one has been able to provide an\nexplanation for the injuries. She reported Youth A was removed\nfrom Caregiver’s home on 5/23/2024 in part due to the\nunexplained injuries which were suspicious in nature.\nDirector of Foster Care was interviewed by video conferencing\non 6/4/2024. She reported not hearing about the marks on Youth\n3",
    "A until after MDHHS Worker began an investigation. Director of\nFoster Care stated she has since been told by Foster Care\nSupervisor that she and Foster Care Worker were made aware of\nthe marks by the designee supervising Youth A’s parenting time\nafter which Foster Care Worker and Foster Care Supervisor tried\nto determine the cause of the marks. Director of Foster Care\nreported there are times youth have marks that wouldn’t create\nconcern such as injuries previously reported by caregivers that\noccurred during play, or marks such as mosquito bites; however, a\nyouth arriving to a visit with unexplained marks that were not\nidentifiable in nature would be reason to report the marks.\nSenior Director of Child Welfare Programs was interviewed by\nvideo conferencing on 6/4/2024. She reported being aware of the\nconcerns related to the delay in reporting the marks on Youth A.\nShe stated the guidance given by Foster Care Supervisor to\nFoster Care Worker to try to determine the cause of the marks\nbefore reporting the marks is not the guidance that should have\nbeen given to Foster Care Worker.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n-Email dated 4/26/2024 from the individual supervising Youth A’s\nparenting time documenting she attached photos of what she\nstated appeared to be “healing burn marks” on Youth A’s face and\narm.\n-Five photos of round, healing injuries on Youth A’s arm and\njawline.\n-Incident report completed by Foster Care Worker on 4/29/2024\ndocumenting the marks on Youth A signed by Foster Care Worker\nand Foster Care Supervisor.\n-Supervision notes dated 5/6/2024 documenting supervision was\nheld to discuss the case.\n-Agency mandated Reporting Policy which indicates all foster care\npositions are considered mandated reporters and must\nimmediately make a report of suspected child abuse or neglect.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as Foster Care Worker\nand Foster Care Supervisor did not comply with child protection\nlaw by failing to report injuries observed on Youth A for nearly two\nweeks.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
    "Rule Code Placement\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404\nSection • (4) An agency shall consider all the following factors in\nDescription selecting an appropriate placement for a child:\n• (b) The physical, emotional, and educational needs\nof the child.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Foster care was aware that the foster child has been living in a\nplacement found to be deplorable and has failed to report or\ndocument the conditions.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant was interviewed by phone on 5/17/2024 at which\ntime Complainant reiterated the concerns noted in the complaint.\nMDHHS Worker was interviewed by phone on 5/17/2024 and\n5/24/2024. MDHHS Worker reported she observed Caregiver’s\nhome on 5/8/2024 at which time there was animal feces and urine\neverywhere except in the children’s bedrooms. MDHHS Worker\nstated Foster Care Worker told her she has never seen the home\nin the condition MDHHS Worker saw the home after which\nMDHHS Worker informed Foster Care Worker she should make\nan unannounced visit to the home. MDHHS Worker stated\nCaregiver had people help her clean up her home prior to Foster\nCare Worker’s next visit, which was scheduled, after which\nCaregiver sent photos of the home to MDHHS Worker. Foster\nCare Worker reported to MDHHS Worker that the concerns with\nthe home had been rectified. MDHHS Worker stated she visited\nthe home again unannounced on 5/23/2024 at which time the\nhome was in the same if not worse condition as it was on the 8th.\nShe stated there was again filth and animal feces throughout the\nhome. She stated the basement of the home was in such poor\ncondition MDHHS worker did not even go down the stairs and\ntook pictures from where she stood. She stated the upstairs of the\nhome was deplorable and there was a cat litter box piled with\nanimal waste. MDHHS Worker reported Youth A was removed\nfrom Caregiver A’s home due to imminent risk of harm to the\nyouth based in part on the conditions of the home.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via video conferencing on\n5/23/2024. She reported Caregiver’s home is “not the cleanest”\nbut she has never had any issues or concerns with safety. She\nstated she has never seen feces or urine in the home and has\n5",
    "never seen it as unclean as the photos taken by MDHHS Worker.\nShe stated the home is cluttered, but the floors are cleared. Foster\nCare Worker stated she completed a visit to Caregiver’s home on\n4/25/2024 at which time the home was in the condition she\ntypically sees the home. She reported she received the photos\nfrom MDHHS Worker from her 5/8/2024 visit. Foster Care Worker\nvisited the home the following day at which time there was no\nanimal feces or urine, and the home was significantly cleaned up.\nCaregiver took pictures of the home that day which she sent to\nFoster Care Worker and MDHHS Worker. Foster Care Worker\nstated she visited the home again on 5/22/2024 and the home\nwas in the same condition it was in during her last visit. She stated\nthat visit was also scheduled. Foster Care Worker stated\nCaregiver told her she was still picking up and that the basement\nhad flooded. Foster Care Worker stated she did not see the\nbasement and did not go upstairs as Caregiver told her it was too\nmessy for her to go up there. Foster Care Worker stated there are\nno bedrooms in the basement or upstairs. Foster Care Worker\nreiterated she feels the home is acceptable and safe.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing\non 5/23/2024. She reported she was the worker on the case from\nApril 2022 until Foster Care Worker took over in September 2023.\nShe stated Caregiver has moved a few times and there have\nnever been safety concerns with any of her homes. She reported\nthe kitchen has never been “the cleanest” and there are typically\ndishes stacked up as if she washed them once a week. She sated\nthe emergency exits, window screens, locks, and baby gates have\nall been clear and intact. She stated the homes have all been\nappropriately baby proofed. She stated when she was the pictures\ntaken by MDHHS Worker she was very shocked as she has never\nseen the home in that condition and has never seen feces or urine\nin the home. Foster Care Supervisor reported Caregiver’s current\nhome is more than an hour away from the agency, so it isn’t\nreasonable to make unannounced visits. She stated she visited\nthe home along with Foster Care Worker earlier this year and\nthere were no safety concerns at that time. She stated the floors\nwere all clear except for toys, which were corralled within a\nspecific area by baby gates.\nDirector of Foster Care was interviewed by video conferencing\non 6/4/2024. She reported not hearing about concerns with the\ncleanliness of Caregiver’s home until the MDHHS Worker began\nan investigation. She reported Foster Care Worker developed a\nsafety plan with Caregiver to rectify the cleanliness concerns.\nDirector of Foster Care stated she believed Caregiver was able to\n6",
    "clean the home for Foster Care Worker’s visits but was not able to\nmaintain that level of cleanliness between visits. She stated she\nwas unaware the worker had neither seen the upstairs nor the\nbasement of the home.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n-Ten photos of Caregiver’s home taken by MDHHS Worker on\n5/8/2024 showing the home in the condition MDHHS Worker\ndescribed during her interview.\n-Six photos of Caregiver’s home taken by Caregiver on 5/9/2024\nshowing the home in the condition Foster Care Worker described\nduring her interview.\n-Eighteen photos of Caregiver’s home taken by MDHHS Worker\non 5/23/2024 showing the home in the condition MDHHS Worker\ndescribed during her interview.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as the Foster Care\nWorker and Foster Care Supervisor did not ensure the safety and\nappropriateness of the home by failing to view the upstairs or\nbasement, which were unsanitary and unsafe. Additionally, after\nMDHHS Worker observed the home in deplorable condition,\nFoster Care Worker scheduled an announced visit to the home\nand determined the concerns were rectified; however, the home\nwas again observed in deplorable conditions within two weeks.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJune 17, 2024\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 20, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7",
