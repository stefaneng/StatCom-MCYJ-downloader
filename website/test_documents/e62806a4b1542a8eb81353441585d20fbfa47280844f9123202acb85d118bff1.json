    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nUpon entering the Wolverine Human Services facilities, the Vassar House staff will\nutilize the same security/guard booth that services the various boys programs. The\ndriveway for the Vassar House building is located to the left, between the Clarence\nFischer Center and the WAVES program (Camp 3).\nUpon entering the Vassar House building, a comfortable “family room” can be found on\nthe left. This room complete with a fireplace, is designed to welcome family members of\nthe residents or other members of the community and provide a relaxed space for\nmeetings and visits. Across the hallway, to the right of the entrance, will be an open\nadministrative area. This will house the secretarial staff, clinical staff and locked file\nrooms. Further down this hallway on the right, one will find two intake offices designed\nto make the transition into residential placement as smooth as possible.\nAt the end of this hallway, a look to the right will find the self-supported medical\nfacilities. This area, with its own locked entrance doors, will service Vassar House\nyouths in a variety of ways. Offices in this area will be held by dental personnel, medical\nstaff, locked medication storage, and locked medical record storage.\nAt the end of the first hallway, a left turn will lead to the remaining parts of the building.\nOn the right-hand side, one will find a large professional kitchen, attached to a dining\ncommons area that will serve as a multi-purpose room during off-meal times. Looking\ninto the dining commons are two-way mirrors, allowing staff to observe the safety of the\nresidents without distracting them or interfering with their activities. These mirrors can\nalso be found on the opposite side of the hallway, looking into the building’s four\nclassrooms. There are doors at both ends of these classrooms, providing a congestion-\nfree way to move one group into a classroom, while moving another group to the next\nactivity.\nA little further down this hallway, across from the remaining classrooms are school\noffices and a section of offices and treatment rooms that will house the Growthworks,\nInc. staffing team. These therapists will be the main influence on the youth during their\nprogression in the “treatment” units, providing top-of-the-line substance abuse therapy.\nThrough the doors at the end of this hallway, one will find an outdoor covered walkway\nthat leads directly to the 5 units that will physically house the young women during their\nstay at Vassar House. The first two doors on the right will be considered the\n“behavioral/stabilization” units, housing 14 young women each during their first few\nweeks at the Vassar House program. These units are designed to introduce the young\nwomen to the program and prepare them for their intensive treatment. One of the\n3",
    "unique features of these first two units are the “reflection rooms” located next to the\ngroup leader’s office in each unit. These rooms provide a safe environment for young\nwomen to remove themselves from a situation, regain their composure, and return to\nthe group safely, avoiding any potential conflict or crisis.\nAfter their stay in one of the first two units, the young women will physically move into\nthe “treatment” units, the third and fourth doors in the row of units. In these units the\nyoung women will receive approximately 90 days of intensive treatment from\nGrowthworks, Inc. therapists and staff.\nOnce the young women prove successful in their treatment, they will again make a\nmove to enter the “reintegration” unit. This final step of the Vassar House program is\nlocated in the larger 12-bed unit on the far left. This unit houses its own kitchen and\nlaundry facilities and is designed to provide young women with the skills needed to be\nsuccessful when they move back into the community. Here they will firm up their\naftercare plans and receive resources that will work to enhance their success and prove\nto themselves and the community that they are committed to change.\nB. Program Description\nWolverine Human Services, has created a residential behavioral health program,\nW-CARE-GI, for adolescent girls, offering chemical dependency education and trauma\ninformed services. Clients will initially be stabilized behaviorally while being prepared for\nan intensive treatment setting. Clinical care will provide a holistic approach, utilizing a\npersonal recovery plan where girls learn about the relationship between substance use\nand traumatic experiences. Girls will gain the ability to regulate intense emotional\nresponses, often a reaction to traumatic life events, while also developing tools to\nremain sober.\nAn additional component includes a step-down stage which allows the clients to practice\nrecovery and empowerment tools and prepare for the transition from residential care to\nthe community. Vocational and life skill development will also be incorporated to\nprovide each girl with increased chances for successful community reintegration.\nIntensive therapy for the program is provided by Growth Works Inc., a leader in the\ntreatment of chemically depended people.\nThis facility is fully self-contained and will house up to 70 female clients, ages 12-18. All\nintakes will be provided a detailed assessment to determine the appropriate level of\ncare as defined by ASAM criteria. A multi-dimensional assessment (DUSI-R, youth) also\noccurs to guide the treatment planning and individual needs.\nAs treatment begins, there are four phases that residents can successfully complete.\nThe first phase is the behavioral stabilization phase. This phase lasts approximately 3-5\nweeks and serves to prepare the young woman for treatment expectations. The\nbehavioral portion is not mandatory and based on a case review can be eliminated.\n4",
    "The second phase is the evaluation phase which lasts 5-10 days. The young woman’s\nfamily is brought in for an in-depth intervention concerning the effects of substance\nabuse on the family unit.\nThe primary treatment phase is the third phase and lasts approximately eight weeks.\nResidents will identify the impact and consequences of substance use and learn\nessential recovery skills. Parents will attend a “Family Week” where they participate in\nsubstance use/abuse education and relationship building to assist in creating a\nrecovery-supportive home environment.\nThe step-down phase is the last phase of treatment. This phase begins with a five day\nwilderness trek utilizing Wolverine’s Pioneer Adventure Program confidence building\nexercises. The young women are reintegrated into their family system via home visits.\nAfter completion of the treatment phases, the young women can enter the transitional\nliving segment of the Vassar House program. This vitally important phase is designed to\ncement after care goals and commitment to sobriety. Community resources will be\ndeveloped with a focus on AA/NA meetings and counseling services.\nEducational services are provided by the Vassar School System and the Tuscola\nCounty Intermediate School district. There is on-site regular education, as well as\nspecial education services, educational testing and GED testing.\nW-CARE-GI treatment modalities will incorporate the Twelve Steps of Recovery from\nAA, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Motivational Interviewing. These two evidenced\nbased treatment modalities will be used in conjunction with Wolverine Human Services\nSeven Principles (Reality, Responsibility, Respect, Communication, Negotiation,\nEducation, and Love) as well as the Motivation and Learning System of a point-level\nprogress structure will be utilized to teach discipline, self-confidence and self-control.\nVassar House is unique in that it concentrates on gender specific issues as well as\ntreatment. Vassar House treatment staff will provide mentoring relationships rooted in\nthe realities of girls’ own lives. Vassar House will also provide empowerment strategies\nthat will assist in building self-esteem and confidence with-in every young woman.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe facility is in compliance with all rule areas that can be evaluated prior to actual\nprogram implementation, and demonstrates evidence of intent to comply with all\nother applicable rule areas.\n5",
