Compliance\nDate Exit Conference\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that a resident was not receiving a prescribed medication as ordered. It\nis also alleged that the resident was not receiving weekly blood draws to monitor the\nprescribed medication.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn April 15, 2020 DCWL received the complaint as outlined above. I initiated a\nspecial investigation on the same day. The complainant was interviewed as well as\nagency staff. Documents were received and reviewed as well as the file of Resident\nA, the alleged victim in this case. What follows is information obtained from the\naforementioned sources.\nOn April 15, 16, 17, 2020, the Complainant was interviewed by telephone. The\nComplainant is the foster care worker for Resident A. The Complainant offered the\nfollowing information. Resident A is a 15 year old female who was placed at\nTeaching Family Homes South Bluff program in Marquette from March 10, 2020 and\nwas replaced to the Kids First program in Grand Rapids on April 13, 2020. The\ncomplainant reported that while Resident A was placed at Teaching Family Home\n3",
    "(TFH) she was not receiving a prescribed psychotropic medication, (Clozapine) and\nin addition, she was not receiving weekly blood draws to monitor the medication.\nThe Complainant reported that Resident A had received only one blood draw while\nin the care of TFH and that occurred on March 27, 2020. The Complainant reported\nthat weekly blood draws were medically ordered to monitor the levels of the\nClozapine medication. The Complainant reported additionally that when Resident A\narrived to the Kids First program there was not a transfer of the prescribed clozapine\npsychotropic medication to Kids First, indicating that it had run out and Resident A\nhad not been receiving it while placed at TFH. The Complainant reported that she\nsent an email on March 12, 2020 to the social service worker at TFH and the\nconsulting physician assistant for the agency, in which she informed them that\nResident A requires weekly blood draws to monitor the clozapine medication. The\nComplainant also reported that March 10, 2020, when she dropped off Resident A at\nTFH she provided agency staff with the blood draw order. Upon my request, the\nComplainant forwarded to me emails between she and staff at TFH as well as\nmedical reports and information for Resident A.\nOn April 15, 2020 and April 16, 2020, the Chief Administrator for Teaching Family\nHomes was interviewed by telephone. During the April 15, 2020 interview the Chief\nAdministrator reported that blood draws had been occurring by the medical facility\nUpper Great Lakes Family Health in Marquette. The Chief Administrator did not\nknow if the prescribed clozapine had been forwarded to the Kids First program and\nperhaps it had been left behind at the agency. The Chief Administrator referred me\nto the supervisor for the South Bluff program for further information. During the April\n16, 2020 phone conversation with the Chief Administrator she reported that she had\ninvestigated the situation further and confirmed that Resident A’s clozapine had run\nout while she was placed in the program and it was not refilled. The Chief\nAdministrator reported that Resident A had been without the medication for about\ntwo weeks and only 1 blood draw had occurred, on March 27, 2020. The Chief\nAdministrator referred me to the contracted physician assistant that provides medical\nservices for residents at the program. I requested and received from the Chief\nAdministrator medication logs for Resident A during her stay at the program.\nOn April 17, 2020 and June 11, 2020, Staff 1, a Lead Direct Care Staff was\ninterviewed by telephone. Staff 1 reported that Resident A’s clozapine medication\nwas contained in bubble packs with other medications. Staff 1 reported that bubble\npacks containing Resident A’s medications did not list clozapine however this\nmedication was listed on the medication logs.\nOn May 8, and May 13, 2020, the Physician Assistant was interviewed by telephone.\nThe Physician Assistant reported that she did not change or stop medication for\nResident A and had no idea why or how clozapine was stopped. The Physician\nAssistant reported that she does not review medication logs. The Physician\nAssistant reported that medications come in bubble packs and the clozapine might\nhave run out and staff would not know this as there are often several medications in\na bubble pack. The Physician Assistant reported that agency staff had informed her\n4",
    "that weekly blood draws are required for Resident A and so she ordered 1 blood\ndraw for monitoring Lithium blood levels and received the results on March 27, 2020\nand reported that nothing abnormal was noted. During the interview on May 8, 2020,\nthe Physician Assistant reported that weekly blood draw monitoring for clozapine is\nnot needed.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nA review of Teaching Family Homes medication logs for Resident A from March 10,\n2020 to April 13, 2020, were reviewed. A review of the log for March indicates that\nclozapine was not administered to Resident A on March 12, 15, 17, 18, 24, 25, 27,\nand 28, 2020. A review of the log for April indicates that clozapine was not\nadministered to Resident A on April 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 2020.\nA document from Network180 (Kent County’s CMH) located in Grand Rapids, dated\nDecember 12, 2019, and signed by the psychiatrist, ordered weekly blood draws for\n6 months for Resident A.\nA Well Child Exam dated March 24, 2020 conducted by the Physician Assistant lists\nmedications for Resident A which includes the clozapine medication.\nAn email from the agency Chief Administrator dated April 15, 2020 acknowledges\nthat Resident A had not been receiving the clozapine medication for approximately\ntwo weeks and it was not refilled by the agency.\nAn email dated March 12, 2020 from the Complainant to the agency Social Service\nWorker and the agency contracted Physician Assistant informs them of the medically\nrequired weekly blood draws to monitor the clozapine medication and the blood\ndraws needed to continue for 6 months.\nA review of the file for Resident A provided the following information. The file\nindicates that Resident A was first prescribed clozapine on August 29, 2019. An\nUpdated Service Plan dated March 31, 2020 refers to the required weekly blood\ndraws for Resident A.\nOn April 24, 2020 and June 11, 2020, Teaching Family Homes intake packet for\nResident A was reviewed. The packet contained the following information:\n1. The Network180 physician ordered weekly blood draws.\n2. A DHHS document titled “Prescription Medication” which listed the clozapine\nmedication.\n3. Resident A’s medical passport which documents clozapine medication.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nANALYSIS: The emails from the Complainant to the agency Social Service\nWorker and the Physician Assistant document that the agency\nwas notified upon intake of Resident A’s clozapine medication\nas well as the medically ordered blood draws. Intake packet\ninformation also established that the agency was aware of\nResident A’s medical needs upon her placement into the\nprogram.\nMedication logs established that Resident A was not receiving\nher clozapine medication on a daily basis as prescribed. There\nwas a document that indicates that only 1 blood draw was\nconducted during her month long stay at the program.\nThe Chief Administrator acknowledged that Resident A was\nwithout her clozapine medication for about 2 weeks and only 1\nblood draw was conducted.\nThe agency failed to provide medically ordered routine medical\ncare and the dispensing of a prescribed medication.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
