DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nBoth male houses are located on the west side of the center of campus. Ashmun and\nSherk share housing designs wherein each house is a one-story, ranch-style home with\na basement. The basement is used for group activities, for storage, for doing laundry,\nand as a “mud room” for shoes, coats, etc. Each house has a kitchen and a dining area\nwhere the youths eat breakfast, weekend meals, and other meals during times when the\nmain campus dining area is closed (Ashmun youths eat all of their meals at the house).\nEach house has a day area/living room and a bathroom. The sleeping area is in line-of-\nsite of the day area, and consists of seven bedrooms. Two youths sleep in each room,\nand the additional bedroom is used for storing clothing. Each bedroom contains\nshelves for clothing, a bunk bed and a desk. In addition there is a House Supervisor’s\noffice and a storage room for toiletries, first aid and medications.\nB. Program Description\nThe residential older boys program consists of two separate houses – Ashmun House,\nwhich serves an abuse/neglect population, and Sherk House, which serves a\ndelinquency population. The residential program serves male youths ages 12 to17 in\nSherk House, and ages 13 to 16 in Ashmun House. These youths are struggling with\n2",
    "emotional and behavioral issues to the extent that the youth, the family and/or the\ncommunity have been negatively impacted, resulting in the youth being removed from\nthe home and the community.\nThe program accepts youths from the following.\n• DHS Delinquents.\n• DHS County offices (abuse/neglect).\n• County Court referrals.\n• Adoption Subsidy referrals.\n• Private referrals.\n• School Referrals.\nResidential programming is designed to meet the psychological, emotional, behavioral\nand spiritual needs of the youth and family. This is done through the following services:\n• Individual/group/family counseling.\n• Experiential programming including a 12-day wilderness program, weekend\nwilderness programs, community service programs and ropes and towers\ninitiatives.\n• Substance abuse counseling groups (when necessary).\n• Psychiatric evaluation (when necessary).\n• Psychological testing (when necessary).\n• Life skills.\n• Educational programming.\n• Home visits.\n• Voluntary chapel programming including chapel services, youth groups, and\nspiritual counseling.\nResidents attend year round schooling with on-campus school staff through the\nMecosta/Osceola School District. Each classroom is staffed with one special education\nteacher and one teacher’s aide. Youth Counselors, House Supervisors and other\npersonnel provide additional supervision if necessary.\nEach house has two Family Counselors who develop and manage the overall treatment\nof the youths. The Family Counselors are responsible for providing individual, group\nand family counseling, and are an integral part of the experiential programming.\nTreatment is provided using the cognitive-behavioral and experiential approaches.\nThere is also a point/level and token economy system that is used primarily as a daily\nbehavior management tool.\nYouths in Ashmun, the abuse/neglect house, tend to stay in care longer than the youths\nin Sherk, the delinquency house. Discharge from the program can occur through\nGraduation, Escalation, Truancy or Maximum Benefit. With a discharge due to\nGraduation, Escalation or Maximum benefit, the date of termination is established at\nleast 30 days prior to release, so that transitional counseling and maximizing community\nsupport services can occur.\n3",
