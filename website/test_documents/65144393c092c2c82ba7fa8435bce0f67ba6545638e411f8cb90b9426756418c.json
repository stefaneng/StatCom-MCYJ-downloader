She said Youth D had her hair done in four or five\nbraids on 1/5/24 and one braid was gone by 1/9/24. Complainant\nindicated another youth (Youth J) pulled the braid out of Youth D’s\nhead and Youth D filed charges against her on 1/10/24.\nGovernment Worker 1 completed a well-being check on Youth D\non 1/10/24.\nConsultant 2 attempted to interview Youth D at the facility on\n1/11/24, but she was at the hospital being evaluated for a\nheadache apparently resulting from the incident with Youth J.\nThis investigation was transferred to me on 1/17/24.\nI interviewed Youth D jointly with Government Worker 1 on\n1/22/24. She has been at the facility for six months. On 1/6/24\nYouth D said she was arguing with a peer and Youth J came up\nbehind her and pulled one of her braids out of her head. “Staff 1\nand Staff 2 were trying to stop Youth J. Youth J threw the remote\nat Staff 1 and it hit her in the throat…Youth J tried to stab me with\na pen but hit Staff 1 instead…I was moved to another unit and\ntalked to police about it.”\nI interviewed Youth J jointly with Government Worker 1. They use\nthey/them pronouns. Youth J said Youth D threw a shoe and it hit\nthem in their face. “Youth D started punching me in the face. I\ngrabbed her hair. Staff grabbed my hand, and it had her hair in it.”\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were on the unit and intervened. “Staff 2\ncalmed me down. Youth D kept trying to get to me…Staff 1 was\ntrying to calm Youth D.” Youth J said she had minor scratches\nand a bruise as a result, but they were not seriously injured.\n2",
    "I interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present. He has worked at the facility for ten months.\nStaff 2 said he was working on an adjoining unit and heard\ncommotion on Peace wing. When he arrived on the wing, Youth\nD was verbally and physically aggressive and Youth A was\nrunning away from her. “They spoke of each other’s deceased\nparents. Youth J became triggered. Youth D threw two shoes at\nYouth J, and I felt water. Youth J became verbally and physically\naggressive. They ran around the sofa. Youth J had a pen in their\nhand. I grabbed their wrist and safely removed it from their hand.\nStaff 1 was between Youth D and Youth J and de-escalating\nYouth D. Youth J reached over and grabbed Youth D’s hair and\nthe whole braid (which covered a quarter of her head) came out. I\ncalled Team Leader. Team Leader decided to remove Youth D\n(from the wing) for safety. I observed a couple scratches around\nYouth D's neck and face. Her scalp was red and exposed.”\nOn 1/22/24, I attempted to interview Staff 1 but she was on\nmedical leave. I interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government\nWorker 1 on 1/24/24 via video conference. She has worked at the\nfacility for eight months. Staff 1 recalled on 1/5/24 Youth D and\nanother youth argued. Youth D chased the other youth, then\nYouth J attacked Youth D. Youth D had a pen in her hand. “Me\nand Staff 2 stood between them, so Youth D didn’t stab Youth J.\nYouth D and Youth J kept trying to run toward each other. Youth\nJ grabbed Youth D’s hair and ripped the braid out. Youth D had\nscratches near her eye and her head was very red. Team Leader\nlooked at her head and took Youth D off of the wing.\nVideo\nI viewed video of the incident on 1/6/24. Staff 1 and Staff 2 are\ntalking with Youth D.

On 1/8/24, Nurse 1 came\nand put ointment on her scratches and head.
