    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The\nagency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan in response to the renewal\ninspection completed on 3/1/2023 with a corrective action plan approved on\n3/16/2023. During the 2023 review the agency had three violations: R 400.12327\n(5) Special evaluation, FOM 722-06B FTM Documentation and FOM 801-03\nMedical passports. One of the citations found during this year’s inspection was a\nrepeat from the 2023 renewal (R 400.12327 (5) Special evaluation). During this\nperiod under review the agency noted there were no barriers to achieving overall\ncompliance, however as noted, there is a repeat violation. Therefore, the agency\nwill need to address why the prior corrective action plan did not result in\ncompliance for that rule.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment reported the agency did not experience any difficulty in meeting\nrequirements during this review period. The Chief Administrator (CA) stated the\nCAP submitted during the last inspection was able to be implemented with no\nissues and the impact on the agency was positive.\nThe CA reported the agency utilizes several tools including MMR, Book of\nBusiness and Info View reports in order to drill down and assess what areas of\nimprovement are needed. The metrics are also reviewed during supervision\nmeetings with staff. The CA expressed confidence the agency will continue to\nimprove over the next review period.\nFinancial Overview\nFinancial records were reviewed and there were no concerns identified.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported supervisors\nmeet with them regularly and coworkers are available as needed if issues arise.\nStaff reported feeling supported by the agency personally and professionally and\nhad no concerns.\n5",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, licensing and adoption services. Records are stored\nsecurely.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Agency Analyst identified the following safety concerns:\nSafety Alert #1: Relative caregivers did not have their guns stored properly.\nResolution: Agency provided photos to verify that all guns are now stored properly\nand have trigger locks as required.\nSafety Alert #2: Licensed foster home was observed to have an unscreened\nwindow, unfinished flooring, missing drywall, hole in a wall and foster youth's\nbedroom door was broken.\nResolution: The agency provided photos to verify the broken bedroom was\nreplaced, hole in the wall was patched, missing drywall was repaired, unfinished\nflooring was completed, and screws inserted on windows, so the top pane without a\nscreen is inoperable.\nSafety Alert #3: A lock was observed on the outside of a bedroom door in a\nlicensed foster home.\nResolution: The agency provided photos to verify the lock has been removed. A\nspecial evaluation was also initiated.\nSafety Alert #4: Licensed foster home had door alarms that were not in working\norder as well as guns that were not properly stored.\nResolution: The agency verified the foster family purchased cable trigger locks and\na case for the bow. A special evaluation was initiated. The agency followed up with\nthe foster family to ensure the items were received and all guns and bows are now\nproperly stored.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n6",
