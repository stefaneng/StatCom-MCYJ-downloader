Sixty of\nsixty employees had either a driver’s license or identification card\non file. Sixty of sixty employees had an I-Chat result on file which\nwas run in the name that was on their driver’s license or\nidentification card.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with having a record of any\nconvictions for all employees on file. All sixty employees I-Chat’s\nwere run in the correct name on their identification and not in their\nmiddle names.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\nSection (1)An institution shall maintain employee records for each\nDescription employee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this rule:\n(g) If the employee has criminal convictions, the institution shall\ncomplete a written evaluation of the convictions that addresses\nthe nature of the conviction, the length of time since the\nconviction, and the relationship of the conviction to regulated\nactivity for the purpose of determining suitability for employment in\nthe institution.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The facility is not completing individual criminal assessments but\nrather using the same information for several employees.\nInvestigation Documents Reviewed:\nOn October 15, 2025, sixty employee files were reviewed.

    "employees had the exact same assessment for their criminal\nrecord, which is as follows:\nWritten Evaluation Regarding Suitability for Employment\n[Staff Name]\nThe applicant’s record reflects a non-violent offence. No further\nlegal issues or similar incidents have been reported since that\ntime.\nNature of the Conviction:\nThis offense involved is a non-violent violation. It did not involve\nharm to others, violence, or behavior indicating risk to vulnerable\npopulations.\nTime Since Conviction:\nThe significant passage of time, combined with a demonstrated\nrecord of law-abiding behavior since, indicates rehabilitation and\nmaturity.\nRelations to Youth Aide Role:\nThe offense does not directly relate to the responsibilities at\nMichigan Youth Treatment Center (MYTC), which involves\nproviding supervision, guidance, and support to youth in a secure\ntreatment environment. The violation did not involve abuse,\nneglect or misconduct toward others and does not suggest a risk\nof inappropriate behavior in a youth care setting.\nSuitability for Employment:\nBased on the age of the offense, its minor nature, and the\nabsence of any subsequent incidents, this conviction does not\nappear to disqualify the applicant from serving as an employee at\nMichigan Youth Treatment Center. The applicant has\ndemonstrated personal growth.\nIt was noted in one of the seven files, the applicant had a\ndomestic violence charge that would be considered a violent\nviolation as that could include harm to others, violence, or\nbehavior indicating risk to vulnerable populations.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as the assessments for\nseven of the nine employees with criminal history were not an\nindividual assessment based on each of the employees criminal\nrecord but rather a generic letter in each file.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n6/25/2025 Original Study, CAP Approved 6/30/2025\n3",

Furthermore, I have had no legal trouble since the\nwithin incident.\n[Signed by employee]\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance for obtaining a written\nstatement from employees regarding their convictions.

Youth B said all youth are required to be in\ntheir rooms during shower program or it would be a “PREA\nviolation”.

Youth B said he is in his room for 60 to 90 minutes per day\nfor shower program.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nOctober 13, 2025. Youth C said all youth must remain in their\nbedroom during shower time unless it is their turn. Youth C said\nthe doors are unlocked but if you leave your room, you will “get\npoints taken away”. Youth C said he can exit his room once\neveryone is done showering which can take “about an hour”.\nYouth D was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nOctober 13, 2025. Youth D said all youth must go to their rooms\nfor shower program. Youth D said the doors may be cracked open\nbut they may not leave their room unless it is their turn to shower.\nYouth D said he was told that he had to remain in his room\nbecause it was a “PREA policy”. Youth D said shower program\nusually lasts about 45-minutes a day.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on October 8, 2025.\nStaff 1 reported youth are required to be in their bedrooms during\nshower time with the doors unlocked.

Staff 2 said the youth’s doors are\nunlocked however they are not allowed out of their rooms and if\nthe come out they are told it is a “PREA violation” and they are\ngiven consequences. Staff 2 said the consequences for them\nleaving their room would be a zero on their point sheet for shower\nprogram time and could make them fail their day depending on\nhow many other points they have from the day.\nSupervisor was interviewed via telephone on October 5, 2025.\nSupervisor said shower program begins at 6pm and all youth are\nrequired to go to their rooms, however the door remains unlocked.\n5",
    "Supervisor said the youth come out of their rooms one at a time to\ntake a shower and once everyone has showered, they are all\nallowed out of their rooms. Supervisor said if the youth come out\nof their rooms during shower program it is considered a “a major\nviolation” and points are deducted, and it will affect their level.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Michigan Youth Treatment Center Seclusion Variance dated\nJune 6, 2025, was reviewed. The variance does not allow\nfor youth to be secluded during shower time.\n• Michigan Youth Treatment Center Use of Seclusion Policy\nwas reviewed. The policy does not allow for use of\nseclusion during shower time and has very specific\nexpectations for the use of seclusion, the monitoring during\nseclusions, and assessments and notification for post-\nseclusion.\n• Email on July 30, 2025, from Former Chief Administrator to\nMYTC Supervisors and MDHHS Administration. The email\nstated “Hello Team,\nFollowing up on our recent phone call, and in alignment\nwith DCWL compliance standards, the following procedures\nare to be implemented effective immediately to ensure\nthe safety of all Trailblazers during the shower program:\nDuring Shower Program:\no A supervisor must enter the control room and place\nall doors in the unlocked position using the\nmaster control board.\no The expectation is for all Trailblazers to return to\ntheir rooms during the shower program. However,\nyouth have the right to decline returning to their\nrooms.\no If a Trailblazer refuses to go to their room, they must\nbe allowed to sit in the day area during the shower\nprogram.\no At the conclusion of the shower program, all\nTrailblazers are expected to report to the day\nroom for their nightly goal meeting.\n• Email on July 30, 2025, from DCWL Consultant to Former\nChief Administrator. The email stated “Good Afternoon,\nI wanted to let you know that I was able to connect with\nyour PREA Analyst, and she told me that PREA does not\nrequire youth to be locked in their bedrooms for shower\ntime so the guidelines you have established will meet both\nlicensing and PREA expectations.”\n• Email on September 8, 2025, from DCWL Consultant to\nFormer Chief Administrator. The email stated “The key is\n6",
    "that the rooms are not locked. They can ask them to go to\nunlocked rooms and that is not an issue. The problem is\nthem locking them in the rooms so they cannot come out.\nThey cannot provide consequences for not staying in the\nroom or stand in the doorway and force them to be in the\nrooms but asking them to be in their rooms for shower time\nor having that be the standard is not an issue. I would also\nrecommend getting a door on the shower area…they use a\ncurtain right now and have told me it is for safety of any\nyouth that may harm themselves and while I can\nunderstand that I also think leaving that area open could be\na risk for supervision if a youth were to try to sneak in there\nand for issues while youth are showering and only have a\ncurtain between them and the milieu area.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per staff and youth\ninterviews, the youth are being secluded in their bedrooms during\nshower time which is prohibited.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2025SIC0000881 Approved 8/26/25, CAP Approved 9/15/25\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n_____________________________________October 21, 2025_\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 22, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
