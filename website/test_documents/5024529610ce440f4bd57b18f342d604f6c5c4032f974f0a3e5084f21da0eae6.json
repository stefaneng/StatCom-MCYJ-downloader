    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff qualifications\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth K said Staff 1 rubbed her thigh on 4/30/34.\nInvestigation I was assigned this investigation on 5/3/24.\nInterviews:\nI notified Youth K’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation\nassignment, and she expressed no additional licensing concerns.\nI contacted Complainant and notified him of the investigation\nassignment. He expressed no additional concerns.\nI collaborated with Government Worker suggesting he arrange a\nforensic interview for Youth K via Kids-Talk. Government Worker\n1 said Youth K’s Foster Care Worker saw her on 5/1/24 at the\nfacility and Youth K did not tell her Staff 1 rubbed her thigh, rather\nshe told the worker everything was fine. Additionally, Government\nWorker 2 and I had interviewed Youth K on 5/2/24 about another\nmatter and she also did not tell us she was sexually abused by\nStaff 1.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker and Rights\nOfficer present on 5/7/24. He has worked at the facility for five\nmonths. Staff 1 was on administrative leave pending the outcome\nof this investigation. Government Worker 1 read the allegation\naloud. Staff 1 responded, “I don’t recall that situation. It never\nhappened. I only use fist bumps. Otherwise, I have no physical\ncontact with youths. I talk to Youth K sparingly. At no time am I\never alone with her.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker and Rights\nOfficer present. She has worked at the facility contingent for\nseven years. Staff 2 recalled working with Staff 1 on 4/30/24. “I\ndon’t recall that happening. I never observed anything\n2",
    "inappropriate between Staff 1 and Youth K or any residents. I’ve\nonly worked with Staff 1 once or twice.”\nI interviewed Team Leader with Government Worker and Rights\nOfficer present. He has worked at the facility for one year and\nsupervises Staff 1. Team Leader attested that Staff 1 has\nappropriate boundaries with the youths. He added “Youth K has\nboundary issues. I have to ask her to dress appropriately at night\nand to keep space from male staff. We warn male staff to keep\ntheir distance from her.”\nI interviewed Staff 3 jointly with Government Worker and Rights\nOfficer present. She has worked at the facility for nine months.\nStaff 3 recalled working with Staff 1. She stated “Staff 1 has\nstrong boundaries. He doesn’t like being left alone with youth and\nwill seek out female staff…He is always appropriate with female\nresidents.” On the other hand, Staff 3 added “Youth K comes out\nof her room with nothing under her nightgown and gets angry\nwhen redirected.”\nI interviewed Youth A jointly with Government Worker. She said\nshe knows Staff 1 and never observed anything inappropriate\nbetween Staff 1 and Youth K.\nI interviewed Youth C jointly with Government Worker. She\nrecalled the day of 4/30/24. “I was in the room sitting right there!”\nshe protested. “Staff 1 didn’t even touch her. He doesn’t even let\nus get close to him. He’s not like that. Youth K has been saying\neverybody’s touching her. She lies all the time and never tells the\ntruth. Youth K said something about a supervisor too and he is in\nhis office all the time.”\nI interviewed Youth V jointly with Government Worker. She said\nshe was asleep on 4/30/24 and never observed anything\ninappropriate between Staff 1 and Youth K. Youth V added, “This\nis how Youth K is. She always says things about staff – about\nwhat they aren’t doing. Staff 1 never gave me that vibe. He’s a\nnice man.”\nYouth K was unable to attend a forensic interview at Kids-Talk\nscheduled on 5/22/24 because she was psychiatrically\nhospitalized. A second interview was scheduled on 6/5/24.\nHowever, two hours prior to the interview, therapist asked that it\nbe rescheduled as Youth K was currently a truancy risk and on\none-to-one supervision for self-harming behaviors.\n3",
    "On 6/5/24 this investigation was transferred from Government\nWorker to Government Worker 2. Government Worker 2\nrequested a third forensic interview at Kids-Talk. Kids-Talk\nwould not reschedule the interview until Youth K was deemed no\nlonger suicidal or at risk of self-harm.\nYouth K was interviewed by Forensic Interviewer at Kids-Talk on\n6/24/24 with Government Worker 2 and I present in another room\nobserving the interview via video in real time. Forensic\nInterviewer reviewed the rules of the interview and built a rapport\nwith Youth K. Youth K shared “I was sexually assaulted by a staff\nmember” who she identified as Staff 1. “I was on the edge of\ntears after talking to my member. Staff 1 was sitting on purple\nwing at a desk under the camera. I walked in and sat by the\nwindowsill and looked out the window. Staff 1 moved his chair\ncloser to me. He put his hand on my shoulder and right thigh and\nmoved closer to my private area. He rubbed his hand on my thigh\nsaying, ‘It’s going to be okay.’ He rubbed my thigh with his thumb.\nI told him not to touch me and pushed him away. I said I don’t\nwant your comfort and he stopped. I went to the bathroom and\nstarted crying.”\nVideo\nI viewed video footage on 4/30/24 at the time of the alleged\nincident with Government Worker. Staff 1 and Youth K appeared\nto be in the general area sitting separately in chairs beneath and\noutside of the camera’s view. There was no physical contact\ncaptured on video.\nGovernment Worker 2 had no findings.\nAnalysis There is no evidence that Staff 1 touched Youth K inappropriately\nor is unable to perform his job duties as assigned.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n4",
