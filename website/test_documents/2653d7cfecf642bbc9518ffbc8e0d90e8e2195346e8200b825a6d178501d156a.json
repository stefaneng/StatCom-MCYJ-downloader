    "their hand on a youth to create space is not an approved procedure. He also\nreported being told by Staff 1 that “she was upset over Youth A using an open hand\nto slap her on the front of her head” because she said she “doesn’t like to be\ntouched”.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 4/23/21. He described the incident.\nI thought we were messing around because she bumped into me and then hit\nme on the shoulder with a back hand slap. I hit her back on the shoulder and\nshe hit me again in the chest with something like a punch. I taped her on the\nforehead area before she hit me again in the shoulder.\nYouth A reported that Staff 1 told him “I was at the fucking point that I was going to\npunch you in the chest”. He also reported that this was the time he walked away. He\nreported Youth B and Youth C witnessed the incident. He ended by reporting that he\nfeels safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 4/23/21. He reported being present during\npart of the incident described in the allegations. He also reported observing Youth A\nhit Staff 1 with a “soft tap of his fist on her shoulder”. He reported that Staff 1 then\n“hit Youth A in the chest with her fist”. He denied hearing any inappropriate language\nfrom Staff 1 and ended by reporting that he feels safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Youth C at the facility on 4/23/21. He reported being present\nthroughout the incident described in the allegations. He gave the following\ndescription.\nYouth A and I were standing near the window looking out when Staff 1 came\nover and asked us what we were doing. She had a phone in her hand and\nYouth A told her to get off her phone just before he slapped it out of her hand.\nI think he hit her wrist area. She tapped him on the shoulder like a love tap\nwith an open hand and he smacked her on the forehead with an open hand.\nYouth C reported that Staff 1 raised her voice and Youth A “looked like he wanted to\nfight her”. He also reported getting between them to keep them from fighting before\nStaff 1 went to the office and he walked with Youth A down to his room. He reported\na belief that Staff 1 “handled herself well”. He ended by reporting that he feels safe\nat the facility.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 at the facility on 4/23/21. He reported being told about\nthe incident but not present. He also reported being told by Staff 1 that she was hit\nfirst by Youth A and was pushing him away to keep from being hit again. He\nreported that Staff 2 informed him that Staff 1 was “visibly upset” over the incident.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 at the facility on 4/23/21.

She also reported\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "receiving “stories that don’t match up” after speaking with Youth A and Staff 1. She\nreported that Youth A denies touching or hitting Staff 1 and Staff 1 reported that it\nstarted when Youth A knocked her phone out of her hand.\nI interviewed Staff 1 by phone on 5/10/21. She reported never hitting Youth A. She\nreported that Youth A knocked her phone out of her hand and when she went to pick\nit up, Youth A hit her on the “top of my head”. She reported telling Youth A “don’t\ntouch me like that”, while standing in front of him. She also reported that at that time,\nYouth A struck her in the arm and she “put out my arm straight to put space between\nus”. She reported telling him “I don’t like being played like that”. She reported not\nbeing upset until Youth A began to laugh at her and she was in the office area.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone on 5/11/21. He reported not observing the incident\nbut speaking to Staff 1 later in the shift. He also reported that she informed him that\nYouth A had knocked her phone from her hand and struck her on the head. He\nreported that she appeared upset when he first observed her following the incident.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the incident report dated 4/20/21. The incident is described as follows:\nWhen Staff 1 turned around, Youth A knocked the staff's phone out of her\nhand. Staff 1 bent down to get her phone when Youth A hit her in the head.\nThe staff stood up and said, \"don't put your hands on me like that\", and Youth\nA proceeded to hit her again, in the arm this time. Staff 1 then placed her\nhand on client near his chest area and created some space between them by\nlightly pushing him backwards and reiterated \"do not put your hands on me\nlike that\" and then staff walked away.\nI reviewed the personnel file for Staff 1 and there was no documentation of\ndisciplinary action. There was also documentation that Staff 1 had completed all\nrequired training including behavior management techniques including de-escalation\ntraining.\nI reviewed the following policy/procedures.\nBehavior Management Procedures [05-01]. This policy states that staff are to use\n“a variety of de-escalation approaches and activation of client self-control plans”.\nAnother technique is “Staff members can avoid power struggles by offering options\nand stating clearly what the staff will do instead of telling the client what to do”.\nBehavior Management Procedures – Recommended Techniques [05-01.1]. This\npolicy states the following. “Expectations: Use a neutral voice tone and a confident,\nyet non-threatening posture to clearly communicate what is expected of a client.\nOften, staff can ask clients to describe the expectation which can reduce resistance.”\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "Behavior Management Procedures – Prohibited Techniques [05-01.2]. This\npolicy states, “Corporal or physical punishment including hitting” is prohibited.\nCrisis Management Procedures [05-02]. This policy states, “Physical management\nwill only be used after all other less restrictive methods of intervention have been\ndetermined as ineffective”.\nI reviewed the facility “Fill in” document. This document states the behaviors of youth\nfor each shift. On 4/20/21 during the PM shift it is noted, “Youth A was given 2 days\nof C1 consequences for striking Staff 1. He appeared very upset.”\nI reviewed the safety plan developed for Youth A. This document is dated 5/7/21 and\nis titled “Personal Boundary and Safety Plan for Youth A”. Youth A is to avoid\ntouching peers and staff while staff are to “exercise vigilance and continual\nmonitoring of Youth A”. Staff are also to use “redirection if Youth A begins to interact\ninappropriately with peers”.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(2) At a minimum, the behavior management system shall\ninclude all of the following:\n(a) A structured system designed to reward the positive\nbehavior of individual residents based upon the effort put\nforth.\n(b) Positive intervention strategies to assist residents in\ndeveloping improved problem solving, self-management,\nand social skills.\n(c) Written guidelines for informally resolving minor\nmisbehavior.\n(d) Written rules of conduct that specify all of the\nfollowing:\n(i) Expected behavior.\n(ii) Acts that are prohibited in the institution.\n(iii) The range of interventions that may be\nimposed for violation of those rules.\n(e) Scheduled training for institution personnel in the\nbehavior management system.\n(f) A provision for resident input into the proper\napplication of the behavior management system.\n(g) A provision for the distribution of behavior management\npolicies and procedures to residents, parents, and referral\nagencies.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as Staff 1 did not use an\nappropriate method when attempting to deal with Youth A’s\nbehavior. Her striking him with her hand is not a method that is\napproved by the facility and is not a “positive strategy” in\nassisting Youth A to make positive choices in his actions.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIII. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended, upon receipt of acceptable action plan no change made to the\nlicense of this Child Caring Institution.\n5/12/21\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 17, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
