INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12313 (2) Behavior support policy; life-saving\nSection intervention.\nDescription\n(2) An agency shall ensure that methods of behavior\nmanagement for a foster child are positive and consistent,\nbased on each foster child’s needs, stage of development,\nand behavior, and promote self-control, self-esteem, and\nindependence. Problems of child training shall be handled\nwith sympathy and understanding.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It has been reported that a foster family is using a level system for\ndiscipline with a female youth. In addition, the foster family is\nusing seclusion with another youth in the home.\nInvestigation Youth A’s case file was reviewed. The file indicated\nthat Youth A, age 14, was placed in the foster on 12/22/22. She\nwas replaced on 8/25/23. Prior, Youth A had several placements\nthat included being in a detention facility 3 times. Her file\nindicated that she is diagnosed with major depression disorder\nand attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nComplainant was interviewed on 7/21/23, regarding this\nallegation. It was reported that Hillsdale was completing an SER\non the foster family but wasn’t citing the family for the discipline\nbecause the agency did not feel the rules prohibit the use of the\nfoster parents’ behavior management plan. The details provided\nwere that the youth is required to wear a “uniform”. She has\nmultiple plain shirts, but only one pair of pants that are washed\nevery night. Youth A is not allowed to speak to any of the children\nin the home, the only people she can speak to are the foster\nparents. In order for Youth A to speak, she must raise her hand.\nYouth A is required to sit in a specific chair for the day. The\ncomplainant reported the family specifically stated they are not\nisolating the youth because she is allowed to be around them,\n(Foster parents), they call it a separation. It was reported this\ngoes on indefinitely until Youth A follows the rules enough to be\nmoved up to the next level. The Complainant said the foster\nparents stated they received the policy from the local youth home.\n2",
    "Program Manager contacted this Consultant on 7/26/23 via\nemail and reported that she was confused regarding the allegation\ndirectly on the agency. She reported there is currently a special\nevaluation newly assigned on the foster home as well as a DHHS\ncomplaint regarding the allegation with the foster parents which is\nstill in the investigation process. The Program Manager reported\nher agency has already determined that there will be findings of\nnon-compliance in the home, but they are also continuing to\ninvestigate concerns.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed on 7/26/23 via video\nconference with the Licensing Supervisor and Program\nManager. The Foster Care Worker reported that Youth A was\nplaced in the foster home on 12/22/22. She reported other\nchildren were placed in the home at the time of the complaint but\nhave sense been replaced. She reported the foster home was\nplaced on hold for placements after the second allegations were\nmade against the family. They and will remain on hold pending the\ncompletion of DHHS investigation and the agency special\ninvestigation evaluation. The foster care worker reported that the\nfoster parents’ have been providing care for Youth A since\nDecember 2022. She said in June 2023 after significant\nbehavioral issues foster parents decided to implement a similar\nstructured plan for their home. This plan was a level system\nranging from the most restrictive being level 0 to the least\nrestrictive being level 4. It was during the 48 hours of being on\nlevel 0 that Youth A was given very few freedoms. Youth A was\nmade to wear a uniform which consisted of one pair of pants\n(washed nightly) and a few plain colored shirts to choose from.\nYouth A was also given no snacks or desserts during this time,\nshe was not allowed to speak to anyone in the home except for\nthe foster parents by raising her hand and waiting to be called on.\nThe Foster Care Worker said Youth A was made to sit in a chair\nwhen she was not completing chores, exercising, showering, or\ncompleting other tasks allowed by the foster parents. The foster\nparents explained the level system was not meant to harm the\nchild but instead they were hoping that because a similar\nstructured plan worked so well while she was in detention, this\nsame routine would help her to be successful outside of the\ndetention center. The Foster Care Worker said the foster parents\nexpressed their love for Youth A and reported they only wanted\nwhat is best for her. She said the foster parents was hoping Youth\nA would learn through the loss of freedoms/privileges she would\nbe successful. The Foster Care worker reported at no time was\nshe aware of another youth in the home being place on seclusion.\n3",
