INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127\nSection Staff to resident ratio\nDescription (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval checks\nshall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff did not complete interval checks on a youth prior to the youth\nAWOL’ing.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nSeptember 19, 2025. Supervisor 1 reported he was notified by\nstaff during the morning meeting huddle on September 8, 2025,\nthat Youth A was missing from the home for several hours over\nnight. He reported if a youth is to leave the home without\npermission and is deemed to be AWOL, staff are to notify the on-\ncall supervisor right away, which he reported did not occur in this\nsituation. Supervisor 1 reported he reviewed the video footage of\nthe incident on September 7, 2025. He reported he watched Youth\nA go out on the front porch of the facility around 9pm and then left\nat 9:20pm. Supervisor 1 reported there was no footage showing\nstaff actually checked on Youth A on the porch which was not in\ncompliance with their supervision policy. He reported Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 were the second shift staff working with Youth A that day\nand Staff 3 was the overnight staff working. Supervisor 1 reported\ndue to the concerns of lack of supervision and not reporting this\nincident all three staff are no longer employed at the facility.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on September 22, 2025.\nStaff 1 reported on September 7 he was working second shift with\nStaff 2. He reported Staff 2 does not typically work one on one\nwith the youth as she does more of the medical appointment\ncoordination but due to staffing issues Staff 2 worked that night.\nStaff 1 reported from 2pm to 7:45pm he was in charge of\ndocumenting the fifteen-minute checks. He reported these checks\nare to only be done when the youth are within their bedroom. Staff\n1 reported if a youth is on the porch or downstairs, it is best\npractice to try to be with the youth but if unable, to know where\nthey are. He reported if youth are downstairs, in the living room, or\n2",
    "outside and staff are not directly with them, staff do not need to be\ndocumenting the fifteen-minute checks on them. This consultant\nconfirmed with Staff 1 the checks are to be done every fifteen\nminutes or at random intervals and Staff 1 reported he was trained\nit is every fifteen minutes. Staff 1 reported after he was done doing\nher checks at 7:45pm he handed it over to Staff 2 to take over. He\nreported he went on to do medication passing. Staff 1 reported he\ngave Youth A his medication around 8:50pm and that was the last\ntime he saw him. He reported Staff 2 was in charge doing the\nchecks at this point and he was unaware of Youth A even going\non the porch. Staff 1 reported he left his shift around 10:20pm that\nnight and thought Youth A had been in his room as Staff 2 stated\neveryone was accounted for. He was unaware that Youth A had\nAWOL’d that night and did not find out until he was contacted by\nDirector the following day. Staff 1 reported he was very frustrated\nbecause he verified before he left for the night with Staff 2 that\neveryone was accounted for. He reported he has heard from other\npeople that some staff do not do the checks on the youth, which\nhe believes now Staff 2 never completed any checks. He reported\nhe has heard from other workers that their facility lacks when it\ncomes to the fifteen-minute checks and he feels that there needs\nto be more oversight by the supervisors at the facility. Staff 1\nreported he also feels there needs to be better training and follow-\nup with staff post training because he felt they do a lot of video\ntraining that do not give that real life experience. He reported he\nfeels there needs to be follow up from supervisors on making sure\neveryone is doing their job correctly and understands how to do\ntheir jobs.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on September 22, 2025.\nStaff 2 reported she does not typically work as a direct care staff\nwith the youth as her role at the facility is to more coordinate\nmedical appointments. She reported she has been trained as a\ndirect care staff but does not know all the policies and protocols as\nthat is not her typical job. Staff 2 reported she was called in to\nwork the second shift on September 7, 2025, as the facility\nneeded additional staff to be within ratio. She reported Staff 1 was\nin charge of completing the fifteen-minute checks on the youth.\nStaff 2 reported earlier in the shift, two other youth had left the\nfacility without permission, so she was making sure those two\nyouth did not leave again. She denied ever doing any physical\nchecks but made sure the two youth did not leave their room. Staff\n2 denied ever documenting anything on paper or in the computer\nfor checks to be completed. When asked more to explain the\nrequirements for these checks, Staff 2 confirmed when a youth is\nin their bedroom then fifteen-minute checks need to be completed.\n3",
    "She reported she was trained by other staff that you do not need\nto open the door and look at the youth and to document they are\nstill in their room every fifteen minutes. Staff 2 reported at the end\nof the night she saw on the paperwork that staff are supposed to\nphysically see the youth in their rooms, but she stated that does\nnot happen with staff. She also confirmed the staff are not trained\nthat it needs to be variable intervals, just every fifteen minutes.\nStaff 2 reported she was unaware if these checks were only for\nwhen the youth are in their bedroom or if they are out of line of\nsight of staff. She reported she has witnessed staff pull up the\ncamera footage to see what the youth are doing in the basement\nand outside, they don’t physically always check on the youth. Staff\n2 reported she knew that Youth A was outside later on that\nevening but thought he had come back into his room. She\nreported she did not know if there were any rules about youth\nbeing outside and what the supervision looks like. Staff 2 reported\nshe was unaware that he went AWOL from the facility around\n9:20pm and was only notified the next day by staff.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on September 23, 2025.\nStaff 3 reported he came into work third shift at 11pm on\nSeptember 7, 2025. He reported when he arrived Staff 2 was the\nonly staff there. Staff 3 reported he had asked Staff 2 how the shift\nwent, and she reported that it went well overall. He reported Staff\n2 told him there were two youths that had gone AWOL over the\nshift, and she had called on-call supervisor about this. Staff 3\nreported Staff 2 then left the facility, and he began to do room\nchecks. He reported when he checked Youth A’s room, he noticed\nhe was not in his room, and he assumed Youth A was one of the\nyouth that Staff 2 was talking about that had gone AWOL. Staff 3\nreported Staff 2 never told the names of the youth that went\nAWOL. He reported Youth A returned back to the facility around\n1:50am. Staff 3 reported he completes room checks every fifteen\nminutes over night and he actually opens the doors to look at the\nyouth in their room. He reported it can be variable intervals to do\nchecks, but he does them every fifteen minutes. Staff 3 reported\nthat he has come onto shift and noticed that there have been\nmultiple times where second shift staff have never documented\ntheir checks.\nVideo Recording\nVideo record of September 7, 2025 during the time of\n08:57pm to 9:23pm was reviewed by this consultant. This\nvideo footage is captured outside of the home in the front area.\nYouth A walked out the front door to sit at the patio at 8:58pm and\nthere was no staff with him. At 9:02pm, another youth from the\n4",
    "program comes out the door to talk with Youth A outside for about\na minute. At 9:07pm, another youth from the program comes out\nthe door to talk with Youth A outside for about ten minutes. At\n9:17pm, Youth A is again fully alone outside. At 9:23pm, Youth A\nwalked out of the camera view towards the road of the building.\nThere was no staff seen checking on Youth A while he was\noutside the home within this video review.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n- Facility Incident Report dated 09/08/2025 completed by\nSupervisor 1- This incident report notes on 09/08/2025 at\n7am Staff 4 was notified by Staff 3 that Youth A had gone\nAWOL for 3 hours overnight.

She reported she was\nunable to locate the observation log that should have been\ncompleted by Staff 1 and Staff 2 during second shift of\n09/07/2025.\n5",
    "- Facility Observation Log dated 09/07/2025 from\n11:10pm to 09/08/2025 6:34am- This facility observation\nlog was completed by Staff 3. He started his checks at\n11:10pm which noted all youth were in their rooms, except\nYouth A. He reported at the 2:01am check all youth were in\ntheir rooms and did not say Youth A was still gone. Staff 3’s\nbedroom checks were noted to be completed at 11:10pm,\n11:30pm, 11:50pm, 12:00am, 12:15am, 12:30am, 12:45am,\n1:00am, 1:15am, 1:32am, 1:47am, 2:01am, 2:16am,\n2:30am, 2:45am, 3:01am, 3:15am, 3:30am, 3:45am,\n4:00am, 4:15am, 4:30am, 4:47am, 5:01am, 5:15am,\n5:45am, 6:01a,. 6:16am, and 6:34am. These checks do not\nfall within the timeframes required by licensing as some of\nthem are not variable intervals as they were every fifteen\nminutes and some of them were over the fifteen minute\nmark.\n- Human Resource File for Staff 1- Staff 1 had been\nworking at the facility since October 2024. He has no noted\ndisciplinary actions within her HR file prior to this incident.\nStaff 1 was up to date on all required training and most\nrecently completed the supervision requirements training\non 02/28/2025.\n- Human Resource File for Staff 2- Staff 2 had been\nworking at the facility since April 2023. She has no noted\ndisciplinary actions within her HR file prior to this incident.\nStaff 2 was up to date on all required training and most\nrecently completed the supervision requirements training\non 12/02/2024.\n- Human Resource File for Staff 3- Staff 3 had been\nworking at the facility since May 2020. He had two prior\nprevious performance coaching plans due to in May 2022\nhe was not completing bed checks within the intervals not\nto exceed fifteen minutes and for not following the facility’s\ncode of conduct. Staff 3 was up to date on all required\ntraining and most recently completed the supervision\nrequirements training on 11/28/2024.\n- Facility internal investigation report- The facility’s\nHuman Resource department completed an internal\ninvestigation report of the concerns of these allegations\nbetween 09/10/2025- 09/12/2025. Within the findings it\n6",
    "noted the following about the three staff: “Staff 1 on\n09/7/2025 violated the State of Michigan Licensing Policy\nand Employee Misconduct policy when falsifying\ndocumentation by agreeing with 15- minute checks were\ncomplete on a specific client when the checks had not been\ncompleted. Staff 1 placed the client at risk by not knowing\nwhere the client was after 9:30pm and did not create an\nEmergency Incident Report-AWOL alert as required. Staff\n2 on 09/07/2025 violated the State of Michigan Licensing\nPolicy and Employee Misconduct policy when falsifying\ndocumentation by agreeing with 15- minute checks were\ncomplete on a specific client when the checks had not been\ncompleted. Staff 2 placed the client in a risk scenario by not\nknowing whereabouts and did not create an Emergency\nIncident Report- AWOL alert as required. Staff 3 on\n09/08/2025 violated ORR reporting process when he failed\nto place an Emergency Incident Reported into Orr’s case\nmanagement system within four hours of knowledge of the\nincident. Furthermore, when Staff 3 was required to\nparticipate in an internal investigation, he became evasive\nand sarcastic telling the investigator multiple to go and\ninvestigate the video system himself, violating the\nEmployee Misconduct Policy.” Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3\nall had separations of employment on 09/15/2025.\nAnalysis The facility was found in non-compliance of staff completing eye-\non interval checks on youth when they are not in direct\nsupervision of staff. This was found to be evident as within the\ninterviews with staff and video review, no staff completed an eyes-\non check on Youth A when he was sitting on the porch and staff\nwere unaware, he left the home. It was also found within the\nobservation check log, Staff 3 was completing bedroom checks on\nyouth that were either exceeding fifteen minutes or being\ncompleted every fifteen minutes.\nTechnical Assistance\nWithin interviews with staff, it appeared they were unaware of\nexactly what the policy was for checking in on youth. There were\nconcerns noted from the interviews that staff only have to do a\ncheck every fifteen minutes, staff do not need to fully go into a\nyouth’s bedroom to check on them when sleeping, and that staff\ncan watch the cameras when the youth are outside or downstairs\nas their check ins. Staff also provided feedback that needs to be\n7",
    "more supervisory oversight and check ins with staff. Staff also\nreported that there needs to be more in-person trainings rather\nthan only computer-based trainings. This consultant recommends\nfor there to be increased supervisory oversite and more in-person\ntrainings, especially as it pertains to policies and procedures.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n09/18/2025 Renewal, CAP Approved 09/19/2025\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4150\nSection Incident reporting\nDescription (3) If an institution determines that a youth is absent without legal\npermission, then the institution shall immediately report the\ninformation to law enforcement, the parent/legal guardian or next\nof kin, the licensing authority, and the referring agency.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Facility did not report to licensing authority or law enforcement in\nan immediate base time frame of Youth A being deemed AWOL.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nSeptember 19, 2025. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1, Staff 2, or\nStaff 3 never called the on-call supervisor or police when Youth A\nwas considered to be AWOL. He reported he did not report the\nincident to Licensing Consultant immediately because he was not\naware of Youth A being AWOL until 09/08/2025 around 9am.\nSupervisor 1 reported due to the concerns of this situation he\nneeded to figure out first what happened as Youth A was already\nreturned safely. He reported once he had the information he\nneeded that was when he reported it to Licensing Consultant.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on September 22, 2025.\nStaff 1 reported he was unaware that Youth A had even AWOL’ed\nfrom the facility during his shift on September 7, 2025. He\nreported if he was aware she would have called the on-call\nsupervisor to be given directions on what next steps need to\ntaken. Staff 1 reported the on-call supervisor is the one to tell staff\nwhen to call law enforcement to make a report. He reported she is\nunaware of who reports the incident to state licensing but does not\nbelieve that is the staff’s responsibility.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on September 22, 2025.\nStaff 2 reported since she did not know that Youth A had left the\nfacility she did not call the on-call supervisor. She reported the\npolicy is if an incident occurs like a youth leaves the facility without\npermission, staff are to call the on-call supervisor right away. Staff\n2 reported the on-call supervisor then will tell staff what next steps\n8",
    "need to be taken, such as contacting the police or going out to\nlook for the youth. She reported she is unaware of who notifies\nother people about an AWOL incident, such as state licensing.\nStaff 2 reported she believes that is the job of the on-call\nsupervisor, but it did not occur during the incident because the\nstaff were unaware that Youth A was gone from the facility.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on September 23, 2025.\nStaff 3 reported he did not call the on-call supervisor when he\nnoticed Youth A was not in his room because Staff 2 mentioned\nshe had already talked to on-call supervisor earlier that day. He\nreported he assumed everything was already handled. Staff 3\nreported the protocol is that if a youth leaves the home without\npermission staff are to call the on-call supervisor immediately. He\nreported the on-call supervisor tells staff what to do next. Staff 3\nreported the on-call supervisor had given him direction before to\nnot call local law enforcement until two to four hours after the\nyouth left the facility. He reported he does not know who notifies\nstate licensing of the AWOLs.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n- Facility Incident Report dated 09/08/2025 completed by\nSupervisor 1- This incident report notes on 09/08/2025 at\n7am Staff 4 was notified by Staff 3 that Youth A had gone\nAWOL for 3 hours overnight. Staff 4 had reported this\ninformation to Supervisor 1 on the morning of 09/08/2025.\nSupervisor 1 completed a video review of the incident\nwhere Youth A was sitting on the front porch of the facility\nat 9pm on 09/07/2025. Youth A began walking away from\nthe facility at 09:23pm. Youth A did not return back to the\nfacility until 1:52 am on 09/08/2025. Within the report it\nnoted that Licensing Consultant was notified of the incident\non 09/08/2025 at 5:30pm. It was also noted there was no\nreport made to local law enforcement.\n- Email from Supervisor 1 to Licensing Consultant dated\n09/08/2025 at 3:06pm- Licensing Consultant was notified\nof Youth A’s AWOL on 09/08/2025 at 3:06pm. Licensing\nConsultant confirmed with this consultant that there were\nno other emails sent or phone calls made to her of an\nearlier report of Youth A going AWOL on 09/07/2025.\n- Facility Incident Report Policy last updated 7/12/2021-\nWithin this policy it notes that Runaway (AWOL) is\nconsidered to be an action where staff would complete a\nincident report. The policy notes, “Upon an incident\n9",
    "occurring a Supervisor or On-Call staff must be consulted\nimmediately. The Supervisor or On call Staff will notify\nState Licensing within 24 hours in following situations: a.\nAny incident requiring inpatient hospitalization; b. Death of\na resident; c. Runaways (AWOL); d. Unauthorized Outings;\nE. Law enforcement involvement (resulting from resident’s\nbehavior).”\n- Facility Unauthorized Absences (AWOL Policy) dated\n7/2/2025- The facility denies AWOL (Absent Without\nLeave) to be when a child has left or is missing from the\nfacility without authorization. The facility to follow “the\nimmediate actions upon discover of AWOL: 1. Assess if\n911 must be called. Call 911 if any of the following applies:\nchild has successfully absconded and is no longer on the\npremises; the child is need of emergency medical or mental\nhealth services; local or state licensing regulations require\nit. 2. Immediately notify- State Licensing agency.”\n- Human Resource File for Staff 1- Staff 1 had been\nworking at the facility since October 2024. He has no noted\ndisciplinary actions within her HR file prior to this incident.\nStaff 1 was up to date on all required training and most\nrecently completed BCS significant Incident Reporting\ntraining on 10/29/2024.\n- Human Resource File for Staff 2- Staff 2 had been\nworking at the facility since April 2023. She has no noted\ndisciplinary actions within her HR file prior to this incident.\nStaff 2 was up to date on all required training and most\nrecently completed BCS significant Incident Reporting\ntraining on 12/02/2024.\n- Human Resource File for Staff 3- Staff 3 had been\nworking at the facility since May 2020. He had two prior\nprevious performance coaching plans due to in May 2022\nhe was not completing bed checks within the intervals not\nto exceed fifteen minutes and for not following the facility’s\ncode of conduct. Staff 3 was up to date on all required\ntraining and most recently completed BCS significant\nIncident Reporting training on 09/09/2024.\n- Facility internal investigation report- The facility’s\nHuman Resource department completed an internal\ninvestigation report of the concerns of these allegations\n10",
    "between 09/10/2025- 09/12/2025. Within the findings it\nnoted the following about the three staff: “Staff 1 on\n09/7/2025 violated the State of Michigan Licensing Policy\nand Employee Misconduct policy when falsifying\ndocumentation by agreeing with 15- minute checks were\ncomplete on a specific client when the checks had not been\ncompleted. Staff 1 placed the client at risk by not knowing\nwhere the client was after 9:30pm and did not create an\nEmergency Incident Report-AWOL alert as required. Staff\n2 on 09/07/2025 violated the State of Michigan Licensing\nPolicy and Employee Misconduct policy when falsifying\ndocumentation by agreeing with 15- minute checks were\ncomplete on a specific client when the checks had not been\ncompleted. Staff 2 placed the client in a risk scenario by not\nknowing whereabouts and did not create an Emergency\nIncident Report- AWOL alert as required. Staff 3 on\n09/08/2025 violated ORR reporting process when he failed\nto place an Emergency Incident Reported into Orr’s case\nmanagement system within four hours of knowledge of the\nincident. Furthermore, when Staff 3 was required to\nparticipate in an internal investigation, he became evasive\nand sarcastic telling the investigator multiple to go and\ninvestigate the video system himself, violating the\nEmployee Misconduct Policy.” Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3\nall had separations of employment on 09/15/2025.\nAnalysis The facility is found in violation as there was never a report made\nto law enforcement of the youth being AWOL. Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere unaware that Youth A had gone AWOL but Staff 3 noted him\nto be AWOL on his first bedroom check at 11:10pm. The facility\nalso did not notify the licensing authority immediately. Even\nthough there was miscommunication about Youth A being AWOL,\nthe leadership team was notified the morning of September 8,\n2025, that Youth A had gone AWOL. Licensing Consultant was\nnotified of the AWOL until 3:00pm on September 8, 2025 that\nYouth A had gone AWOL.\nTechnical Assistance\nWhen reviewing the policies and procedures as it pertains to\nincident reporting and AWOL policy, there is conflicting timeframe\nreporting. Within the facility incident reporting policy, it notes the\nsupervisor on-call is to notify state licensing within 24 hours in the\nfollowing situation: a. Any incident requiring inpatient\n11",
    "hospitalization; b. Death of a resident; c. Runaways (AWOL); d.\nUnauthorized Outings; E. Law enforcement involvement (resulting\nfrom resident’s behavior). This does not follow the time frames\nwithin the state licensing rule requirement for incident reporting.\nThis policy needs to be updated as it noted within the rule\nrequirements for 400.4150. The facility’s Unauthorized Absences\n(AWOL Policy) notes that when a youth is discovered to be AWOL\nthat state licensing needs to be notified immediately, which is in\ncompliance with the rule but does not follow what it does in the\nincident reporting policy. Both policies should be reviewed and\nupdated to be within compliance with reporting requirements per\nstate licensing rules. The staff should also be trained as what the\npolicy is as none of the staff were aware of who does the reporting\nto state licensing. It was also concerning as staff noted they are to\ncall the on-call supervisor first before calling the local law\nenforcement about the AWOL concern. Staff reported sometimes\nthe on-call supervisor has told them to wait a couple hours before\ncalling local law enforcement about the AWOL. This contradicts\nwith what the facility’s Unauthorized Absences (AWOL Policy)\nstates as it states 911 should be contacted immediately when a\nyouth has successfully absconded and is no longer on the\npremises. The policy show be reviewed and made sure it notes\nwho is responsible for taking actions within this policy as staff all\nnoted within their interviews they are just trained to call on-call\nsupervisor and then follow what they tell them to do.\nConclusion Violation Established\n12",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nOctober 7, 2025\n________________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 7, 2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n13"
