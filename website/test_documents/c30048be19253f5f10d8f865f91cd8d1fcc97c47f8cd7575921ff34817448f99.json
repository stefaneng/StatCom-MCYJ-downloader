I\nrequested a copy of the police report generated from Bio-Mothers\ncontact with the police department. Police Officer 1 emailed me\nthe report on this date.\nBio-Mother was interviewed a third time via telephone on\n05/30/24. The Bio-Mother was asked about the rape allegation\nshe had made during the May 21, 2024, FTM. Bio-Mother stated,\n“I said he was a rapist, not that he raped me”.

    "state she was raped by Staff 1. Staff 2 reported she did not hear\nany qualifying statement from Bio-Mother that it was a verbal rape.\nStaff 2 reported the FTM was cancelled after the allegation of rape\nand because the Bio-Mother was using profanity, and she was\nescalated.\nDetective 1 was briefly interviewed on 06/04/24 via telephone.\nDetective 1 reported he was going to conduct interviews of Staff 1\nand Bio-Mother on 06/05/24 or 06/06/24 and he would contact me\nafter the interviews and determine if an investigative case would\nbe opened.\nDetective 2 was interviewed on 06/07/24.

To date, no\ncontact has been received notifying they opened an investigation\nOn 07/02/24 a voice mail message was left for Detective 2\nrequesting a return phone call. As of the date of this report a\nreturn call has not been received.\nOn 7/11/2024 an email was sent to the Inkster law enforcement\ndepartment requesting assistance in gathering a case update.

Chief Administrator indicated Staff 1 has yet to be\ninterviewed by law enforcement officials.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\n• Case File: An FTM dated 05/21/24 indicates the FTM was\nterminated due to inappropriate language. Staff 2 reported\nthat the Bio-Mother was using profanity and was escalated.\nIt was also during this FTM that the Bio-Mother reported\nthat she was raped by Staff 1.The file did not add anything\nelse to the investigation.\n• On 5/30/2024, an emailed request for the law enforcement\nreport was made and received the same day. Inkster Police\nDepartment case report number 240007976, dated\n04/26/24, was reviewed. The report speaks to the\n5",
    "complaint made by Bio-Mother which documents that the\nBio-Mother was asked to perform oral sex on Staff 1 and\nthat he grabbed her buttocks. The report further documents\nthat the Bio-Mother reported that Staff 1 had told her that if\nshe does not perform oral sex on him her children would be\nremoved from her care.\nAnalysis Bio-Mother initially reported she had been touched on her buttock\nby Staff 1 and Staff 1 told her he would not recommend removal of\nher children if she performed oral sex on him. Bio-Mother reported\nthe touching by Staff 1 and Staff 1 asking for oral sex occurred on\n04/12/24. On 4/26/2024 Bio-Mother reported to Inkster Police\nDepartment that Staff 1 asked her to perform oral sex and had\ngrabbed her buttock. Then, during a court hearing on 4/30/24 Bio-\nMother stated Staff 1 asked her to perform oral sex. During an\nFTM on 5/21/24, Bio-Mother had stated she had been raped by\nStaff 1. In a third interview with Bio-Mother she stated she was\nverbally raped by Staff 1. Bio-Mother reported there were no\nwitnesses to these comments and actions.\nStaff 1 denied he ever touched Bio-Mother or had used sexually\nexplicit language or comments or had asked her for oral sex.\nEvidence is inconclusive as the Bio-Mother and Staff 1’s reports\ncontradict one another. There were no witnesses to the alleged\nevents. The Inkster Police Department stated they would notify if a\nformal investigation was opened, and no contact was received\nback indicating they had done so.\nIf additional information is received, further investigation may be\nrequired.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
