    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe exit conference for this review was held on 10/02/20 via Microsoft Teams.\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules except\nfor the following:\nR 400.12212 Personnel records.\n(2) The personnel record shall contain all of the following\ninformation before employment may occur:\n(e) A record of any convictions other than minor traffic\nviolations from either of the following:\n(i) The Michigan state police or the equivalent state or\nCanadian provincial law enforcement agency where the person\nusually resides.\n(ii) An entity accessing either Michigan state police\nrecords or equivalent state or Canadian provincial law\nenforcement agency where the person usually resides.\nOne of two interns did not have an ichat prior to her start\ndate. The intern started working on 9/2/20. Her ichat was\nnot run until 9/29/20 after this audit commenced.\nR 400.12212 Personnel records.\n(2) The personnel record shall contain all of the following\ninformation before employment may occur:\n(h) Documentation from the department that the person has\nnot been named in a central registry case as the perpetrator of\nchild abuse or neglect in Michigan or in any state where the\nperson lived in the 5 years preceding hire.\nOne of two interns did not have a central registry clearance\nprior to her start date. The intern started working on 9/2/20.\nHer clearance was not run until 9/29/20 after this audit\ncommenced.\n4",
    "R 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(1) An agency's medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(d) Current immunizations for each child as required by\nsection 5111 of 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.5111. All of the\nfollowing apply:\n(i) A statement from a parent or licensed medical authority\nwhich indicates that immunizations are current or\ncontraindicated is sufficient documentation of immunizations.\n(ii) A copy of a waiver addressed to the department of\ncommunity health signed by the parent stating immunizations\nare not being administered due to religious, medical, or other\nreasons is sufficient documentation of immunizations.\n(iii) If documentation of immunization or a copy of the\nwaiver is unavailable, then immunizations shall begin within 30\ncalendar days of placement.\nChild 1 entered care on 1/3/20. As of 2/3/20, the child’s\nimmunization record was not in MICSACWIS. The rule\nindicates if documentation of immunization is unavailable, then\nimmunizations shall begin within 30 days of placement.\nThe agency did not check that the child’s shots were up to date\nduring her first 30 days of care. On 10/1/20, this audit revealed\nstill no evidence the child was current on vaccinations. On\n10/5/20, the agency determined from the doctor the child’s shots\nwere indeed current, however the doctor’s office had misspelled\nthe child’s name therefore verification was not in MISACWIS.\nChild 2 entered care on 2/7/20. At that time, her immunization\nrecord showed she had been overdue for a Hepatitis A shot\nsince 7/23/18. The child was seen for a well-child exam on\n2/12/20. On that date, she was not given the shot. As of\n10/5/20, the child’s Hepatitis A still has not been given.\nTwo of eight foster children were not current on\nimmunizations or did not have verification that\nimmunizations were current within 30 days of entering care.\n(Repeat violations from 2019 & 2018)\n5",
    "R 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(2) An agency shall have documentation from the medical or\ndental provider of all medical and dental care received by a\nfoster child.\nBased on uploaded screenshots, it appears Child 1 was seen\ntimely for 9, 12 and 15-month well child exams. However, the\ncompleted exam forms not available and therefore there was no\ndocumentation the forms were signed by the medical provider.\nBased on uploaded screenshots, it appears Child 3 was seen\ntimely for an initial well child exam. However, the completed\nexam form was unavailable and therefore there was no\ndocumentation the form was signed by the medical provider.\nTwo of eight foster child were missing documentation of\nfour well-child exams signed by the medical provider.\n(Repeat violation from 2019)\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans / (DHHS Policy 722-08C -\nPATPs must be signed by caregiver)\n(5) An agency shall involve the foster parents in the\ndevelopment of service plans to enable the foster parents to\nunderstand the plan for the child and the foster parent's role in\nassisting the agency in carrying out the plan.\nEight of twenty-three PATPs were not signed timely in the\nusual manner or any other alternative manner by the\ncaregivers for three of eight foster children. Due to COVID\neach worker was given the opportunity to produce\nverification of alternative methods of obtaining the\nsignatures during the audit.\n(Repeat violation from 2019 & 2018)\n6",
    "R 400.12505 Supervision.\n(2) An agency shall provide the following minimum supervision:\n(b) At monthly intervals, ensure that the youth is complying\nwith the terms of the contract required by R 400.125010,\ncontinues to reside in a safe and acceptable environment, and\nis managing expenditures.\nMonthly budget forms are used to verify that IL youth are\nmanaging their expenditures. One of one IL youth was missing\nmonthly budget forms for the months of April, May, June, July,\nAugust and September 2020. On 9/29/20, the worker stated\nshe did not complete these forms with the youth.\nDHHS management’s stance was that IL budgets were not\nrequired in April, May and June due to COVID-19. However,\nthis is not the case. The worker could have reviewed the\nyouth’s budgets with him, filled out the forms and sought\nalternative methods of signature via video conference.\nOn 10/5/20, DHHS management produced 3 budget forms\nsigned by the worker and youth dated July, August and\nSeptember 2020. It is peculiar that these forms were produced\nwhen the worker had already reported she had not done them.\nNeither management nor the worker would explain how the\nnewly produced documents came to be. These forms were not\naccepted as they were not provided on-site at the time of the\naudit.\nFive of six monthly budgets were not completed with one of\none IL youth.\n7",
    "R 400.12510 Independent living contract\n(2) The agreement shall be signed and dated by the youth and\nthe social service worker. The contract shall be reviewed and\nupdated at least once every 90 calendar days and a copy\nprovided to the youth.\nOn 9/29/20, the IL worker stated she was unaware there was a\ncontract between the agency and the youth. On 10/5/20, DHHS\nmanagement produced three contracts signed timely by the\nworker and youth. Again it is peculiar the documents were\nproduced when the worker did not know they were required.\nNeither management nor the worker would explain how the\nnewly produced documents came to be. These contracts were\nnot accepted as they were not provided on-site at the time of the\naudit.\nOne of one IL youth was missing the initial contract\nagreement and two subsequent contract agreements that\nwere required.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there\nare additional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility\nis in compliance will all additional ISEP requirements except for the following:\nISEP 4.22 MiSACWIS (Commitment 22).\nDHHS will maintain an operational statewide automated child\nwelfare information system (“MiSACWIS”) which\nwill be the primary tracking system and satisfy federal\nreporting requirements.\nThe MISACWIS tracking system is not being fully\nmaintained/updated. Multiple documents (medical exam\nforms, signed PATPs, IL budgets and contracts, and other\nforms) for several children were not uploaded into\nMISACWIS in a timely manner. Many documents that were\ncompleted months earlier were not unloaded until after I\n8",
    "was on-site for the audit and had chosen a sample of child\nrecords to review.\n*Note - A previous corrective action plan submitted by the\nagency indicated that time would be designated each week\nfor social services workers to upload documents into\nMISACWIS. Despite employees working remotely, annual\nlicensing audits continue and all aspects of the statewide\ntracking system must still be maintained.\nISEP 6.43 Mental health screening within 30 days of entry to foster\ncare.\nFour of eight foster children did not have timely ASQs\n(Repeat non-compliance from 2019 & 2018)\nISEP 6.49 Quarterly medical passports\nThree quarterly medical passports were missing or were\nuploaded but not signed by the caregiver for two of eight\nchildren.\n(Repeat non-compliance from 2019 & 2018)\n3. Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHHS policy violation. Please note that there\nare additional DHS Policy requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility\nis in compliance will all additional DHHS Policy requirements except for the following:\n722.06B,pg 11 FTM – Efforts to involve incarcerated parent(s)\nOne of eight foster children has two incarcerated parents.\nThere was no documentation that efforts were made to\ninvolve the incarcerated parents in the development of their\nchild’s service plans (ie, mailing the PATPs) or family team\nmeetings (via phone or video conference). The worker said\nshe was not aware there should be efforts to involve\nincarcerated parents.\n9",
    "IV. CONSULTATION:\nIt is recommended that supervisors ensure that documents are not being uploaded\ninto MISACWIS until the documents are complete. Incomplete and unsigned\ndocuments are misleading, bog down the system and should not be uploaded.\nDocuments should be uploaded in a timely manner and labelled appropriately.\nIf a biological parent cannot be located to sign a PATP within 30 days after\nthe plan is completed, the worker can date the parent signature line (within 30\nof the report), write “parent cannot be located” on the parent signature line, sign\nand date the worker line and then upload the PATP.\nObtaining caregiver and parent signatures on PATPs beyond 30 days after the\nplan is completed is non-compliant and defeats the intent of the rule and policy.\nIf the initial mental health screening (ASQ) is not completed by the doctor, it\nis the social service worker’s responsibility to assure that one is completed and\nuploaded within 30 days of the child entering care. It is recommended that\nsupervisors verify that mental health screenings are completed and uploaded in a\ntimely manner.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no DCWL complaints received or investigations completed during\nthis licensing period. There were no safety alerts identified by the DCWL\nAnalyst.\nThe following items were cited and acceptable corrective action plans submitted\nfor the Renewal Inspection of 2019:\nR 400.12405 (3) (a – j) Change of placement\nR 400.12413 (1) (d) (ii), (1) (f) & (2) Medical and dental care policy\nR 400.12418 (2) (a) & (b) Development of service plans\nISEP 6.49 Quarterly medical passports signed\nISEP 6.33c PATPs signed by parent/guardian\nDHHS Policy 802 Mental health screening within 30 days of entry\nDHHS Policy 722-08C PATPs signed by caregiver\nDHHS Policy 722-6H Four visits in the first two months of placement\nDHHS Policy 722-06I Monthly sibling visits for siblings who are split\nDHHS Policy 722-06B Quarterly FTMs\nV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MSA requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\n10",
    "acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\nOctober 7, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 7, 2020\n_______________________________________\nLinda D.
