She also reported hitting youth on their\narms with no intent to harm and the youth always laugh and\nresponding back with a joke. This type of behavior only happens\non the unit she is working at the time, and she has observed other\nstaff grab youth by their shoulders in a playful manner or hug the\nyouth.

Supervisor 2 reported the\nyouth don’t have an issue with Staff 1, but Staff 4/Complainant\n9",
    "has had an issue with Staff 1. Staff 4/Complainant becomes\ndysregulated quickly and will pass off conflicts (need to issue a\ntime-out) to Staff 1. Supervisor 2 does not believe Staff\n4/Complainant has the emotional stability to handle the issues the\nyouth present.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/18/23\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker.

He reported being hit in the face by Staff 1\ntowards the end of June and provided the following description.\n“We were playing card and I talked loud so she smacked me in\nthe face”. He also reported Staff 1 played around and would hit\nyouth, but it was never too hard. He was present when Youth E\nwas punched by Staff 1 when they were on the unit and after the\nincident of youth looking at female youth when returning from the\ngym.
