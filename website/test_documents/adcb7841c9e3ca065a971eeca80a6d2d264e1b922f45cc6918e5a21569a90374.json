DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nCPA Rule 400.12324 Reevaluation\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the\nreevaluation. The placement specifications must include\nall the following: (a) The age, number, SOGIE, race,\nethnic background, and characteristics of children\npreferred by the applicants.\nOne of three licensing files held a reassessment that did not indicate a preference\nfor SOGIE in the recommendation.\nCPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and family time; in person contact\n(4) An agency shall facilitate in-person contact between\nsiblings who are not placed together except when there\nis a court determination that contact is detrimental to\neither child.\nTwo of six foster care files did not have documentation of a sibling visit for two\nmonths of the review period. The two youth were from the same sibling group.\nCPA Rule 400.12510 Independent living agreement\n(2) The agreement must be signed and dated by the\nyouth and the social service worker. The agreement\nmust be reviewed with the youth at least once every 90\ncalendar days and a copy provided to the youth.\n2",
    "One of three independent living files did not have an IL Agreement reviewed and\nsigned within 90 days of the previous agreement.\nREPEAT VIOLATION\n11/3/2023 Interim review, CAP approved 11/8/2023.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following area:\n• Borrowed Bed files: The agency was reminded to ensure that all Borrowed\nBed documents are uploaded into the provider record in CWLM.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request or require consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during\nthis period under review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) Annual Assessment dated 9/1/25 was reviewed and\ndiscussed. The CA reported staff movement over the last few years, which\nimpacted case management and oversight. The agency reported working diligently\nto address the ripple effect caused by those changes. The CA reported they have\nfaced challenges due to an increased population of youth with significant mental\nhealth needs and high-risk behaviors. The agency has made intensive efforts to\nwork with multiple systems within MDHHS to ensure youth receive the services\nneeded. The CA reported the addition of new supports and services was beneficial\nto youth, caregivers, and staff. The CA reported there were three placement\ndisruptions during this review period. All three were due to youth having\ncomplicated trauma and placement histories. Attempts were made to provide\nsupport and additional services. However, the placements could not be\nmaintained. One youth moved to a relative caregiver, one moved to residential\ntreatment, and the third moved with fictive kin.\n3",
    "Although the agency did not have a CAP from the 2024 review, the CA identified\nmonthly case worker visits and timely medical and dental exams as areas to\ncontinue improving compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on site. Staff had been with the agency between 4-8\nyears. Both staff reported they enjoyed their positions and felt supported by their\nsupervisor. Staff stated they were able to discuss any concerns with administration\nand overall felt supported in their positions. Regarding concerns or suggestions for\nimprovement, staff reported that some mandatory in-person training would be\nmore beneficial if it were online. Workers stated it is difficult to devote an entire\nday to training over material they are already familiar with, when they have so\nmany demands on their time.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same office building as 2024. The\nbuilding has sufficient space for staff and clients to meet and conduct visitation.\nThere is adequate locking storage for files and confidential documentation.\nVII. AGENCY ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were four identified safety alerts.\nSafety Alert #1: During a visit on 7/8/25 the Agency Analyst observed a smoke\ndetector was missing from the basement.\nResolution #1: The agency contacted the family on 7/8/25. The family\nimmediately replaced the smoke alarm, and a photo was provided to DCWL for\nverification.\nSafety Alert #2: During a visit on 7/9/25 the Agency Analyst observed a\nbasement bedroom without a second means of egress. An approved variance\nwas not on file.\nResolution #2: The agency contacted the family on 7/9/25 and developed a\nsafety plan. The licensee's adult son was utilizing the basement bedroom. The\nplan stated that he agreed to sleep in an upstairs bedroom and the basement\nroom would be for storage only. Photos of the bedrooms were provided to DCWL\nfor verification.\nSafety Alert #3: During a visit on 7/10/25 the Agency Analyst observed a smoke\ndetector on the first floor that was not working.\nResolution #3: The foster family had a smoke detector that needed new\nbatteries. The batteries were installed, and the smoke detector was mounted on\nthe wall. A photo was provided to DCWL for verification.\n4",
    "Safety Alert #4: On 7/16/25 the Agency Analyst observed two non-working\nsmoke detectors. One on the first floor and one on the second.\nResolution #4: The non-working smoke detectors were removed, and new ones\nwere installed. An agency foster care worker tested both new smoke detectors to\nconfirm they worked. A photo was provided to DCWL for verification.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A CAP is required.\n___________September 16, 2025______________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 17, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
