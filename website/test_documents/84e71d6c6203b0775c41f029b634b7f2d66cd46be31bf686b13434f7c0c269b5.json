    "Rule Code Special evaluation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327\nSection (1) Upon receipt of any information that relates to possible\nDescription noncompliance with any foster home rule, the agency must do all\nthe following:\n(a) Submit a special investigation record to the department's\nlicensing authority within 5 working days in the manner prescribed\nby the department.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency allowed a foster child to use a basement bedroom\nthat is unfinished. It was aware of the foster home's\nnoncompliance with the rule related the bedroom and allowed it to\ncontinue. It did not alert the department. A variance request was in\nprogress but has not been submitted or approved.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nOn 10/10/2024 I spoke with Complainant, and she confirmed the\nallegations. She reported the child is in a basement bedroom with\npartial walls and that the area is under construction. She reported\nthe foster parent reported they had a variance in place, but per\nCWLM, the agency started a variance in late August 2024, when\nthe child was placed, but never submitted that variance.\nComplainant said the agency started the variance again after\nAugust but have not followed-up on it.\nChief Administrator\nOn 10/11/2024 I spoke with Chief Administrator (CA) about this\nallegation by telephone. CA reported the foster family had been\nworking on putting in a bedroom in the basement, so that any child\nplaced in their home would not have to share a room with the\ncouple’s son. CA reported prior to completion of the construction\non the bedroom, the agency received a referral on 17-year-old\nmale, and the couple did now want this youth to share a bedroom\nwith the foster parent’s son. Therefore, they pursued this youth’s\nplacement in the basement bedroom, that was nice, but since it\ndid not meet licensing requirements the agency sought a variance.\nCA reported she was told a variance was completed by the\nlicensing worker and it was approval. She indicated that would\nhave been why no special evaluation record for any possible rule\nviolations would not have been submitted. She reported she was\n2",
    "following up on this matter and I could speak with the licensing\nworker and licensing supervisor for more information.\nLicensing Worker\nOn 11/4/2024 I interviewed Licensing Worker (LW) by telephone.\nLW admitted Youth A was occupying a basement bedroom in\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2’s home which did not meet\nlicensing requirements. She reported Foster Parent 1 thought he\ncould get the work on the basement bedroom completed over the\nweekend before Youth A was placed but Foster Parent 1 did not\ncomplete the work. She said, then the agency thought they could\nget a variance completed before Youth A’s 8/22/2024 placement\ndate. LW admitted Youth A’s placement was not an emergency\nplacement. She admitted she nor anyone to her knowledge had\ncommunication with DCWL (Division of Child Welfare Licensing)\nabout the agency’s placement situation related to Youth A and a\nneed for a timely variance.\nLW could not answer as to whether she knew the foster home’s\nbedroom construction was not completed prior to the Youth A’s\nplacement in the foster home. She reported to her knowledge the\nfoster care unit was not aware there was a placement issue. Nor\ndid she advise foster care there was one. She stated” We\nprobably dropped the ball on that”. She also did not know if her\nsupervisor was aware that there was a foster home bedroom\nissue. She reported she was told after the fact that Youth A's\nplacement in the foster home had occurred.\nLW reported that she is new to licensing. She reported that Youth\nA’s placement in the foster home did not remind her of the need to\ncomplete the variance. It was the foster family’s renewal coming\ndue that did so. She said she had to go to the home and at the\ntime she saw the bedroom construction was incomplete. She\nadmitted the matter of the variance came up during her\nsupervision with Licensing Supervisor, but she could not recall if\nthat was in August or September of this year. She said they had\ndiscussed the need for the variance on the foster home earlier, but\nafterward they both got busy and forgot about it. She denied\ntelling the foster family that a variance was approved. She told\nthem she had to get one approved. She acknowledged it was her\nresponsibility to complete the variance. She initiated the variance\nagain on 10/4/2024 and it was subsequently submitted and\napproved by DCWL.\nLicensing Supervisor\n3",
    "On 11/4/2024 I interviewed Licensing Supervisor (LS) by\ntelephone. LS reported this allegation matter was discovered\nduring a DCWL Analyst review. She said the DCWL Analyst told\nthem they did not have to open a special evaluation, that they just\nneeded to complete a variance. LS reported “We just dropped the\nball and never finished the variance”.\nLS admitted to knowing there was an issue with the foster family\nbasement bedroom prior to Youth A’s placement. She said Foster\nParent 1 had told the agency he would have the work on the\nbasement walls and ceiling done in 30 days, but Foster Parent 1\ndid not complete the work in that timeframe.\nLS was not aware of anyone telling the foster family that a\nvariance was already approved. Nor had the agency contacted\nDCWL before Youth A’s 8/22/2024 placement about an expedited\nvariance. Though, LS reported that once they submitted the\nvariance to DCWL it was approved in one day.\nFoster Parent 1\nOn 11/4/2024 I interviewed Foster Parent 1 by telephone. Foster\nParent 1 reported not knowing whether he told the agency he\nwould have the ceiling work done on the basement bedroom\nbefore they got a placement. He reported he and Foster Parent 2\nwere told the agency was going to write a variance so that Youth\nA could get placed in their home. Foster Parent 1 could not recall\nwhether he was told the variance would eliminate them having to\ncomplete the remodeling/ceiling work on the bedroom. Nor did he\nknow if they were told the variance was approved before Youth\nA’s placement. He said he did not know the bedroom was still a\nproblem until the DCWL Analyst was out inspecting their home.\nHe reported that there is a variance in place now. He said as to\nthe variance approval before now, he thinks the worker forgot\nabout the variance needing to be completed.\nReviewed\nSafety Alert for Foster Parent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s home\ndated 10/10/2024 which indicated:\n• Foster child’s bedroom does not have finished floor to\nceiling walls. Nor a painted/sealed/finished ceiling.\n• Wellspring’s resolution response indicated they were\nadvised by the DCWL Analyst that no special evaluation is\nneeded. That a three month’s variance to the rule was\nbeing requested. To bring the bedroom into compliance a\nFIG grant request was being submitted to assist the foster\n4",
    "parents in covering part of the financial cost to complete the\ndrop ceiling.\nDocuments from LS showed:\n• The agency submitted for a FIG grant on 10/23/2024 and\nreceived subsequent approval.\n• A photo showing the non- finished wall and incomplete\nceiling of the bedroom in question.\n• A variance approval on 10/30/2024 by the DCWL Director.\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2’s CWLM file showed:\n• The couple were licensed in May 2023.\n• Youth A was placed in the foster home on 8/22/2024. He is\nthe only youth documented as placed in the foster home.\n• A variance was submitted by LS related to the home on\n10/23/2024. This variance was approval by the DCWL\ndirector on 10/30/2024.\n• Documentation listed above as provided by LS.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed, the agency is in\nviolation of this rule. The agency did not submit a special\ninvestigation record to the department within the required\ntimeframe related to the foster parent’s basement bedroom which\ndid not meet foster home licensing rule requirements. The agency\nintended to complete a variance to address this issue but did not\ntimely follow up on that submission prior to the youth’s placement\nin the home and the youth’s occupancy of the non-compliant\nbedroom.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\nDecember 26, 2024\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\n5",
