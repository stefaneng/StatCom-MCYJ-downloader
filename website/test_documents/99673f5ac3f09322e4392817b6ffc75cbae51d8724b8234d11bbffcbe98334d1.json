She reported\nremembering the incident when Youth A informed Staff 1 that\nYouth A’s candy had a smell of acetone. Staff 1 also reported this\noccurred in the middle of November in the overflow pantry. Staff 1\nreported the candy was in the general rack in the overflow pantry\nand the fingernail items were located across the room in a bucket\non the floor which is their normal location (away from all other\nitems in the room). Staff 1 also reported smelling the acetone\nwhen walking into the room and observing Youth A taste the\ncandy. Staff 1 reported telling Youth A not to eat any more after\nsmelling the acetone.

Snacks (food items) are placed on\nthe left side of the room and the fingernail products are in a bucket\non the other side of the room.

    "items. Staff 1 did not recall if the bag of candy was open when\nYouth A picked it up.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n12/17/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker.

The storage door was locked, and the candy\nwas being stored on the left side of the room and the liquid\nacrylic items in a bucket on the right side. However, in\nYouth A’s personal storage container, there was a small\nbottle of liquid acrylic (nail polish removal) and other\npersonal items. The storage room was clean but needed to\nbe organized.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as evidence by interviews with\nstaff and written documentation. Evidence provided through\ninterviews with youth and staff, along with a walk through does not\nsupport that storage room was not clean and in a safe condition.\nAlthough the facility had different items in the storage room these\nitems were not close to each other and supervision was provided\nwhen a youth was accessing the room. During this investigation,\nthe facility shared plans to move the storage room (separating\nfood from non-food items) to ensure this type of issue is removed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n11",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n1/13/2025\n______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n1/22/2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n12"
