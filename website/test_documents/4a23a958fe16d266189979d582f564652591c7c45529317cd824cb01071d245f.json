    "Independent Living Youth A (ILY A) was interviewed on\n01/11/2023 via telephone. Several attempts were set to go to her\nhome address but due to COVID symptoms, no in person contact\nwas made prior to this telephone interview. ILY A reported she\nhad no idea who made this complaint because she never said she\ndid not receive any support or assistance from Community Care\nOrganization. She said she was angry because she could not get\nher check direct deposited when she was in their independent\nliving program, and she did not get her clothing order. She said\nthis took a long time, but she has received her clothing order since\nbeing placed with her current agency. She did not disclose\nadditional information. She said she and her newborn baby are\ndoing well in her current placement.\nThe Program Manager was interviewed on 12/19/2022.

She\nsaid ILY A was provided with information on parenting classes.\nShe said on July 26, 2022, ILY A was provided information on a\nmother-baby program.

She\nsaid additional resources were provided to ILY A on 11/09/2022.\nShe said her agency purchased ILY A a Pack and Play, a car\nseat, and changing table that cost $499.00. The Program\nManager identified several referral forms that were presented to\nILY A that were in ILY A’s case record for review. These forms\nwere, “Foster Youth to Independence Initiative (Tenant Protection\nVoucher)”, Free Diaper Distribution Program, and a mother-baby\nprogram that is provided for teens up to 25 years old. This\nprogram includes feminine products, diapers and pull ups, wipes,\nformula, baby food, new and gently used clothing, shoes, car\nseats and stroller. All of these resources were in ILY A’s case\nrecord with documentation that she was provided the resources.\nThe Program Manager reported she submitted a clothing order for\nILY A on 10/13/2022. She reported she received a payment from\nMDHHS in January of 2023.

The items included: baby pack and play, baby\nswing, baby clothes, and receiving blankets. The case worker said\nshe brought ILY A two packs of baby diapers on 01/12/2023,\nprovided by their agency boutique.

The\nCaseworker said she followed up with the MDHHS monitor on\n02/03/2023 regarding the clothing voucher submitted and was\ninformed that the voucher was made out to Community Care\nOrganization, and she had to make adjustments so that the\nvoucher would be made to the current agency for ILY A.
