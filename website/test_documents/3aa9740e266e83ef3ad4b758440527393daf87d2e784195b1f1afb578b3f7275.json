Youth A\nsaid she was very angry and upset and was trying to hit Staff 1\nand he threatened to punch her. She said Supervisor 1 came on\nthe wing and escorted Staff 1 off the wing. She said the police\nwere called to the facility and she requested to speak to police,\nbut staff would not allow her to speak to the police. Youth A said\nshe wants to file charges against Staff 1. Youth A said Staff 1 has\nnever worked on her unit and that was her first interaction with\nStaff 1.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 03/13/2023, in collaboration\nwith DHHS Specialist. Youth B has been at the facility for 9\nmonths and is on the purple wing with Youth A. Youth A reported\non the day of the incident she was in the shower and heard Youth\nA yelling, so she came out of the bathroom. She saw Staff 1 come\nin through the back door of the wing. Staff 1 asked if staff needed\nhelp and Staff 2 told him they did not need help. Youth B said\nYouth A attempted to grab Staff 1’s keys and Staff 1 slammed\nYouth A against the wall and hit her in the face. Youth B said\nYouth A is “her girl” and she had to protect her, so she hit Staff 1\nseveral times in the head. Youth B said Staff 1 was looking at her\nand Youth A in a weird way and that gave them a weird vibe about\nhim. She admitted to hitting and throwing a water bottle at Staff 1.\nYouth B said Staff 2 and 3 intervened and blocked her from hitting\nStaff 1.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 03/13/2023, in collaboration\nwith DHHS Specialist.

She said Staff 1 put his hands up and cornered\nYouth A while trying to release her hold on the keys. She\nintervened and got herself in between Staff 1 and Youth A. She\ndidn’t see Staff 1 hit Youth A but thinks he may have during the\nincident. She said Youth B did hit Staff 1 several times in the head\nand face. She had to tell Staff 1 to leave the unit several times\nbefore the Supervisor came and escorted him off the unit.\nI interviewed Staff 3 at the facility on 03/13/2023, in collaboration\nwith DHHS Specialist. Staff 3 reported that Staff 1 came on to the\nwing due to “clear” call from another wing, so Staff 2 told him they\ndon’t need any assistance. She saw Youth A attempt to grab Staff\n1’s keys and that’s Staff 1 put his hands up, so Staff 3 intervened\nand attempted to free Youth A’s hands off the keys. She did not\nsee Staff 1 punch or hit Youth A, but Youth B punched Staff 1\nseveral times in the head and face.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 via telephone on 03/13/2023, in\ncollaboration with DHHS Specialist. Supervisor 1 reported on\n03/10/2023 the police were contacted regarding another incident\nand so she did not witness the incident involving Youth A and\nStaff 1. She came on the unit to assist and escorted Staff 1 off the\nunit. Staff 1 was not angry or aggressive but was more disoriented\nand confused. She was informed by staff that Staff 1 was hit in the\nhead several times.\nI received an email from Consumer Rights Officer on 03/27/2023\nindicated that Staff 1’s employment has been terminated with the\nfacility.\nOn 04/04/2023 a Predisposition case conference held with DHHS\nSpecialist and managers. No findings.\nVideo Reviewed:\nThe video has no audio. Youth A and Youth B are observed\nstanding at the door and appear to be upset. There are two staff\nmembers on the unit, and Staff 1 enters the unit through the back\ndoor. He walks toward the two youths. Youth A turns around and\nattempts to grab Staff 1’s keys. Staff 1 attempts to grab the keys\n4",
    "back and puts his hands up. Staff 2 attempts to get in between\nYouth A and Staff 1 as they are standing in the corner of the room,\nand that’s when Youth B comes from behind Staff 1 hits him in the\nhead three times and twice in the face. Staff 3 pulls Youth B away\nfrom Staff 1. Staff 1 appears to be disoriented, he is seen leaning\nagainst the wall with has his hand on his head. Youth A throws her\nshoe at Staff 1, and Youth 2 throws a water bottle at Staff 1.\nSupervisor escorts Staff 1 off the unit while Staff 2 and 3 block\nYouth A and B from assaulting Staff 1. At no point in the video\ndoes Staff 1 appear to hit or punch Youth A. Youth A is seen\nspeaking to a police officer after the incident for several minutes.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident report dated 03/10/2023, written by Staff 2,\noccurred on purple wing in the living room area. Report is\nconsistent with Staff 2’s interview.\n• Staff 1 training logs: Staff 1 completed CPI training on\n02/08/23 and 02/09/23. On 03/03/2023 Staff 1 had 84.5\ntraining hours completed.\n• Youth A’s medical exam completed at Henry Ford Health\non 03/11/2023. There was no head injury or swelling. Youth\nA had a bruise on her left upper cheek.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is insufficient\nevidence to determine that the staff hit the youth during the\nincident. Youth A did sustain a bruise on her face, but because\nthere were three staff members and two youths involved it could\nnot be determined how Youth got the bruise. Staff 1 denied hitting\nor punching Youth A.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (b) Experience to perform the duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Additional Findings\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 did not have the experience to perform the duties of the\nposition.\nInvestigation See content above.\nStaff 1 said he didn’t know how he should have responded in the\nsituation and asked consultant and DHHS Specialist how should\nhe have handled the situation.\n5",
    "Analysis The facility is in violation based on video footage that shows that\nStaff 1 and Youth A engaged in a power struggle over the Staff’s\nkeys. Staff 1 asked consultant and DHHS Specialist how should\nhe have handled the situation, which points to staff lack of\nexperience/training. Staff 1 has only worked at the facility for 6\nweeks, has not completed all his training, and lacks the\nexperience to perform the duties of his assigned position.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nApril 19, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 25, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n6"
