    "EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency was not required to submit any corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe DCWL analyst between the dates of 6/26/19 and 9/6/19 visited three foster\nhomes and three unlicensed relative homes. A total of four foster parents, three\nunlicensed relatives, two foster children and six birth parents were interviewed.\nSafety and Concerns Alerts\nSafety and Concern Alert #1.\nNo concerns noted\nSafety and Concern Alert #2.\nThe family has a pool and do not have an alarm on the door that leads to the pool.\nThe foster parents have their 12-year old niece placed in their home. According to\nthe foster parents they only became licensed for the placement of their niece and the\nagency is scheduled to move child on 8/6/19. The foster parents also stated they\ndon’t intend to have other foster children in their home.\nThe agency was unable to contact the foster parent between 7/31/19 and 8/1/19 to\naddress the concern. The agency was advised by the foster parent on 8/1/19 that she\nwas camping, and the child was with her grandfather while she was camping. This\nwas confirmed by the assigned foster care worker. According to assigned foster care\nworker the child was to be placed with another relative on 8/5/19. The agency was\nplanning to provide an alarm for the pool on 8/5/19 if the child was not placed with\nanother relative as planned. On 8/4/19 at approximately 4:10pm, CPS on call worker\ncompleted a home visit with the foster parent and installed bells on the door leading\nto the backyard which has a pool.\n6",
    "On 8/5/19 Foster Care worker reported that the child returned to the foster home on\nSunday (8/4/19) from being gone for the weekend. The foster care staff also\nconfirmed that the child was moved out of the home on 8/5/19.\nSafety and Concern Alert #2a\nThe foster parent reported the licensing process took 7 months and once they\ncompleted training it took 5 months for them to receive their license.\nThe agency reported that the children were placed in the home on 5/17/19 and the\nhome was licensed on 11/7/19.\n7",
    "The birth parent stated they were not notified of the child’s educational and medical\nneeds.\nThe agency reported the case record documented that the birth parent participated in\ndiscussions regarding psychotropic medications for the children. The parent was\nnotified of all appointments when able to be contacted. The parent signed all but the\nlast two medical passports. The foster care worker attempted to have the parent\nreview and sign both documents. The medical passports were mailed to the parents\nlast known address. Information regarding the children’s education and medical\nneeds was also documented from FTMs and PATPs.\nSafety and Concern Alert #3\nA birth parent reported that they were not made aware of their child’s educational and\nmedical needs or involved in decisions regarding the child’s appearance.\nThe agency reported that the mother was incarcerated 10/15/18-6/14/19. She has\ncontinued to be engaged in discussions regarding her child’s educational and medical\nneeds. She has signed medical passports and PATPs throughout the case. The\nbiological father participated in parenting time and FTMs for a period of time but\nstopped attending parenting time and communication with the worker in May 2019.\nAttempts to reengage the father through phone calls and face to face visits was\ndocumented. PATPs were reviewed including information on the child, until the father\nwas unable to be located. After that time the PATP continued to be mailed to the\nfather despite the disconnect with services. No changes have taken place to the\nchild’s appearance.\nSafety and Concern Alert #4\nA relative caregiver said they were not made aware of available resources, such as\nchild daycare services.\nThe birth parent reported they were not informed of the child’s medical appointments.\nThe agency reported that the relative caregiver was provided a caregiver packet at\nplacement and the packet was reviewed with them by the assigned case manager. In\nthe packed is a publication which outlines the potential assistance that may be\navailable, including daycare assistance.\nThe parent was notified of her child’s follow up medical appointments at discharge\nfrom the hospital and a duplicate copy with the well child appointment date was later\nprovided. It was also discussed with her after parenting time in July and she was\nprovided a list of appointments. This continues to be addressed with the medical\npassport, PATPs and service plans.\nSafety and Concern Alert #5.\n8",
    "No concerns\nSafety and Concern Alert #6.\nNo concerns\nRenewal inspection 2018\nA renewal inspection was completed on 1/14/18. The renewal inspection made\nthe following findings.\nISEP 4.22 MiSACWIS (Commitment 22). DHHS will maintain an operational statewide\nautomated child welfare information system (“MiSACWIS”) which will be the primary\ntracking system and satisfy federal reporting requirements.\nThe agency did not upload all required documents into MiSACWIS. This is a repeat\nviolation. A corrective action plan is required.\nThis interim inspection found the agency in compliance with this requirement.\nISEP 6.18 Page 23 Relative Foster Parent Licensing, Timeliness (Commitment\n54).\nDHHS must license at least 85% of newly licensed relative foster parents within 180\ndays of the date of placement.\nOne of seven relative caregivers reviewed was licensed in excess of 180 days. A\ncorrective action plan is required.\nThis interim inspection found the agency compliant with requirement.\nISEP 5.1 – Page 14 Caseload Progressions for New Employees (Commitment\n23).\nb. For foster care and adoption workers, three training cases may be assigned on or\nafter day one of pre-service training at the supervisor’s discretion using CWTI case\nassignments guidelines. After completion of week three of pre-service training, up to\nfive total cases may be assigned with supervisory approval using CWTI case\nassignment guidelines. Final caseload may be assigned after nine weeks.\nOne new foster care worker was assigned 5 cases on the last day in the 9th week of\ntraining exceeding 5 total cases. A corrective action plan is required.\nThis interim inspection found the agency compliant with this requirement.\n9",
    "DHHS Policy FOM 722-08C Page 2 Required Participation in Development -\nParents\nUpon completion of the parent-agency treatment plan and service agreement, the\nparent is given a copy for review. Foster care workers need to ensure the parent\nunderstands all areas within the agreement. Parents and youths age 14 and older\nmust sign the PATP. If a parent or youth is unavailable or refuses to sign the PATP,\nfoster care workers must identify and document additional action needed to secure\nthe parent’s and/or youth’s participation in service planning and compliance with the\nPATP. As the goals are achieved, modified or expanded, the updated PATP will reflect\nthis process. Parents and youths age 14 and older must participate in the development\nof each updated treatment plan, allowing for opportunity to evaluate their progress\ntowards completing goals.\nNineteen service plans were reviewed. One caregiver PATP and two birth parent\nPATPs were signed more than 30 days after the end of the report period. A corrective\naction plan is required.\nThis interim inspection found the agency compliant with this requirement.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n1/6/19\n________________________________________\nJames B.
