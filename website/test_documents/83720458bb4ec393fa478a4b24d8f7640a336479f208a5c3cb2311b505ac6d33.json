REPEAT VIOALTION, Renewal Report 09/27/19, and\ncorresponding CAP, 10/11/19, and Interim 11/26/18, and corresponding CAP,\n01/08/19. The agency must report why the previous CAPs failed and how they will\nensure compliance.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(4) Before completion of the written report required by subrule (5\n6) of this rule, an agency shall provide the foster parent with a\nverbal summary of the preliminary findings at the conclusion of\nthe evaluation.\nOne of three licensing files reviewed did not document the verbal summary provided\nto the foster parent as required.\nR 400.12403 Policy and procedures.\n(2) The policies and procedures shall cover at least all of the\nfollowing areas:\n(i) Service plans.\n4",

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR 306\nThe agency was advised to ensure that old enrollments are closed. One\nenrolled home was cited last year for not having application and orientation\ndocuments and is still noted to not have the documents, although it remains\nopen.

Additionally, the agency was advised to ensure they obtain annual\nparent agency agreements for borrowed bed placements lasting over one year.\nR 327\nThe agency was advised to ensure they clearly document what the foster parent is\ntold as it relates to advising them of the allegations.

CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nConsultation was provided on where to upload the 30-day transfer plans for foster\ncare. The agency was uploading them to the initial, but they should be uploaded to\nthe current placement at the time the agency receives the case.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The agency was cited in special\ninvestigation 2020C0207027, dated 08/11/20, for a violation of DHHS policy 722-\n06H regarding visits with children in out of home care. The agency missed a face to\nface visit with the youth within the first five days of placement. The agency submitted\na CAP, dated 08/20/20, and there were no noted violations of this requirement in this\ninspection, therefore, it appears the agency has sufficiently implemented their CAP.\nThere were no safety concerns noted in the DCWL Field Analyst report.\nThere are 16 violations noted in this report when compared to 20 in the last\ninspection. This indicates the agency is making efforts to implement their CAP and\nhas been effective in doing so. There are eight repeat violations that the agency is\nadvised to focus on during this next period.\n11",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\nDecember 18, 2020\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 21, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n12"
