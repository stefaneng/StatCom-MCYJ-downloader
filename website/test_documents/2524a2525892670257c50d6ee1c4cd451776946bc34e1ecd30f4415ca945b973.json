Specifically, it has been difficult due to the number of new staff that would\nhave benefitted from face-to-face/in office supervision.\nThe CA indicated the agency has recently implemented the use of training, tracking\nvia spreadsheets, and close supervisory monitoring to achieve compliance.\nSupervision is pulling metrics on a consistent, scheduled basis and staff are\nprompted to review the Book of Business after receiving calendar invitations. The\nagency has also implemented protected time for staff and quarterly review of the\nCAP.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted with four staff via telephone. Staff acknowledged that\nthere were some challenges related to COVID-19 but, overall, staff felt as though the\nagency adapted very well. Staff reported there have also been some challenges\nrelated to being short staffed and felt that more case aids would be helpful. Overall,\nstaff reported feeling supported by supervision and stressed that supervision is\nalways available when needed.\n8",
