METHODOLOGY\n05/28/2020 Special Investigation Intake 2020C0128038\n06/01/2020 Special Investigation Initiated - Telephone\n06/01/2020 Inspection Completed On-site\n06/01/2020 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\n06/01/2020 Contact - Document Received\n06/16/2020 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION:\nFacility failed to notify the department of a change in training curriculum timely.\nINVESTIGATION:\nA review of Teaching Family Homes – Cedar Creek behavior management approval\nwas conducted on May 1, 2020. The approved letter on file was for Crisis Prevention\nInstitutes Non-Violent Crisis Intervention Model (CPI) and was dated May 3, 2018.\nOn May 1, 2020 I emailed Chief Administrator to verify this was the behavior model\nthey were continuing to utilize, and Chief Administrator said, “No. It is Handle with\nCare.” I requested the Chief Administrator to provide me with a copy of the approval\nletter from the department for Handle with Care. Chief Administrator said she never\nreceived an approval letter for Handle with Care.\nChief Administrator was interviewed via telephone on May 1, 2020. Chief\nAdministrator said in April of 2018 she was in contact with the assigned licensing\nconsultant for another licensed facility to provide the information requested for CPI\nand received a letter from the department for approval for all five licenses for that\ntraining curriculum. When the facility was changing from CPI to Handle with Care\nChief Administrator said she sent the request letter to the same consultant instead of\n2",
    "Cedar Creek’s assigned consultant. Chief Administrator said she was “newer” to her\nrole and so was still learning all the requirements needed from the department. Chief\nAdministrator said she did not seek any additional approval or response from the\nassigned consultant for Cedar Creek prior to changing the training curriculum for the\nfacility.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(5) An employee shall not participate in restraining a\nresident or placing a resident in seclusion prior to receiving\ntraining on those topics. The training model shall be\napproved, in writing, by the department.\nANALYSIS: Teaching Family Homes – Cedar Creek administration failed to\nobtain approval in writing for the training curriculum. The facility\nchanged the curriculum and did not make the request to the\nassigned consultant, therefore did not have approval in writing\nfrom November 2, 2018 until May 7, 2020.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend no change in the\nlicense status.\n_____________________________________July 15, 2020\nStephanie Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 5, 2020\n________________________________________\nCourtney Atkins Date\nArea Manager\n3"
