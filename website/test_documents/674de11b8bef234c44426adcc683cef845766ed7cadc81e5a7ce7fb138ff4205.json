DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nCCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\n(1) An institution shall maintain employee records for\neach employee and shall include documentation of\nall of the following information prior to employment or\nat the time specified in this rule:\n(e) Three dated references which are obtained prior\nto employment from persons unrelated to the\nemployee and which are less than 12 months old.\n(i) Directly from the Michigan state police or the\nequivalent state law enforcement agency,\nCanadian province, or other country where the\n2",
    "person usually resides or has resided in the\nprevious 5 years.\nOne of four new employee files did not have 3 dated references completed within\n12 months prior to hire. The staff member worked for another program within\nBethany Christian Services and her references were completed in 2021.\nCCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\n(1) An institution shall maintain employee records for\neach employee and shall include documentation of\nall of the following information prior to employment or\nat the time specified in this rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department\nof human services, the equivalent state or\nCanadian provincial agency, or equivalent\nagency in the country where the person\nusually resides, that the person has not been\ndetermined to be a perpetrator of child abuse\nor child neglect. The documentation shall be\ncompleted not more than 30 days prior to the\nstart of employment and every 12 months\nthereafter.\nOne of four new employee files had a central registry check completed over 30\ndays prior to hire. The employee had a CWL-4624 completed on 6/16/23 and a\nCWL-1929 dated 6/18/23, which are both over 30 days prior to her hire date of\n8/6/23.\nCCI Rule 400.4114 Tuberculosis screening for employees and\nvolunteers\n(1) The licensee shall document, prior to employment,\nthat each employee and volunteer who has contact\nwith residents 4 or more hours per week for more\nthan 2 consecutive weeks is free from communicable\ntuberculosis. Freedom from communicable\ntuberculosis shall be verified within the 1 year period\nbefore employment and shall be verified every 1\nyear after the last verification or prior to the\nexpiration of the current verification.\n3",
    "One of four new employees did not complete a TB test prior to hire.\nCCI Rule 400.4116 Chief Administrator; responsibilities.\n(1) An agency shall assign the chief administrator\nresponsibility for the on-site day-to-day operation of\nthe institution and for ensuring compliance with\nthese rules.\nChief Administrator did not monitor CAP expectations from the facility's 2023\nrenewal audit or the approved CAP from SIR2023C0000713. Based on\ninformation received via email from Program Director on 2/1/24, action steps listed\nin the facility's 2023 renewal audit were not implemented. On 2/2/24, Chief\nAdministrator reported the previous program director was responsible for handling\nand overseeing the CAP dissemination and he's not sure how she did that or who\nshe provided the information to. Chief Administrator reported the implementation\nof the CAP for SIR2023C0000713 was the Unit Supervisor’s responsibility. He\nreported another Branch Director, the Unit Supervisor and Human Resources\ndetermined how to best handle the supervision issues raised and Chief\nAdministrator “was informed”. Chief Administrator reported he didn't have \"direct\nhands-on contact\" regarding ensuring the CAP from the facility’s 2023 renewal\naudit or the CAP from SIR2023C0000713 were implemented.\nIn addition, the Chief Administrator was unaware a supervisor of direct care\nworkers was hired on 12/26/23 who does not meet the qualifications of the\nposition, and a variance was not requested prior to hire. The Chief Administrator\nreported another Branch Director was overseeing the facility and the hiring\nprocess. The Chief Administrator is not aware of the day-to-day operations of the\nfacility and has not completed tasks to ensure the facility's compliance with\nlicensing rules.\nC CI Rule 400.4120 Supervisor of direct care workers; qualifications.\n(1) A supervisor of direct care workers must have 1 of\nthe following:\n• (1) A supervisor of direct care workers must have\n1 of the following:\n• (a) A bachelor's degree from an accredited\ncollege or university and 2 years of work\nexperience in a child caring institution.\n4",
    "One of one supervisor of direct care workers does not have any experience\nworking in a CCI and, therefore, does not meet the requirement of the rule. The\nfacility did not request a variance prior to hire.\nCCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of\nthe direct supervision of staff, staff shall perform\nvariable interval, eye-on checks of residents. The time\nbetween the variable interval checks shall not exceed\nfifteen minutes.\nTwelve observation/room check logs were reviewed for December 2023 and\nthirteen observation/room check logs were reviewed for January 2024. Out of the\ntwenty-five logs reviewed, nineteen were for third shift. Out of the 542 documented\nroom checks completed on the logs reviewed for 3rd shift, only 267 checks were\ncompleted in variable intervals not to exceed 15 minutes (49%). Of note, on\n12/4/23, only three room checks were documented and there were no checks\ndocumented after 12:33 am.\nRepeat Violation Established\nSIR2023C0000713, CAP approved 11/8/23.\nCCI Rule 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(3) The licensee shall document that each staff person\nwhose function is covered by these rules has\nparticipated in a minimum of 50 clock hours of planned\ntraining within the first year of employment and a\nminimum of 25 clock hours of training annually\nthereafter related to the employee’s job function. At\nleast 16 of the 50 hours provided in the first year shall\nbe orientation provided prior to the assumption of duties.\nOne of four new employees did not receive 16 hours of orientation prior to\nassumption of duties.\nRepeat Violation Established\nRenewal 2023, CAP approved 11/8/23.\nCCI Rule 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; initial treatment plan\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and\ndate an initial treatment plan for each resident within\n30 calendar days of admission.\n5",
    "One of three open youth files did not have an initial treatment plan completed\nwithin 30 days of admission. The youth was admitted on 12/27/23 and her ITP was\ndue by 1/25/24, but wasn't completed until 1/31/24. It should be noted the case\nmanager wrote the report during the time this Consultant was on-site for the audit\n(1/30/24), and submitted it to the program director for review the following day\n(1/31/24).\nCCI Rule 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; initial treatment plan\n(2) The initial treatment plan developed by the social\nworker shall document input from the resident, the\nresident’s parents, direct care staff, and the referral\nsource, unless documented as inappropriate.\nOne of three open youth files lacked documentation the youth provided input for\nthe development of the initial treatment plan. The youth did not sign the plan, did\nnot check the boxes at the end of the treatment plan confirming their participation\nin the plan, and there is no documentation in the file of a treatment planning\nmeeting (or similar) involving the youth.\nRepeat Violation Established\nRenewal 2023, CAP approved 3/6/23\nCCI Rule 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; initial treatment plan\n(4) The social service worker shall sign and date the\ninitial treatment plan.\nOne of three open youth files did not have the initial treatment plan signed by the\nworker.\nCCI Rule 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; initial treatment plan\n(5) The social service supervisor shall approve,\ncountersign, and date the initial treatment plan.\nOne of three open youth files did not have the initial treatment plan signed by the\nsupervisor.\nRepeat Violation Established\nRenewal 2023, CAP approved 3/6/23\nCCI Rule 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; updated treatment plan\n6",
    "(2) The updated treatment plan developed by the social\nworker shall document input from the resident, the\nresident’s parents, direct care staff, and the referral\nsource, unless documented as inappropriate.\nOne of three open youth files lacked documentation the youth provided input for\nthe development of the initial treatment plan. The youth did not sign the plan, did\nnot check the boxes at the end of the treatment plan confirming their participation\nin the plan, and there is no documentation in the file of a treatment planning\nmeeting (or similar) involving the youth.\nRepeat Violation Established\nRenewal 2023, CAP approved 3/6/23\nCCI Rule 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; updated treatment plan\n(5) The social service supervisor shall approve,\ncountersign, and date the updated treatment plan.\nOne of three open youth files did not have a supervisor signature on an updated\ntreatment plan. The UTP dated was dated 6/8/23.\nRepeat Violation Established\nRenewal 2023, CAP approved 3/6/23\nCCI Rule 400.4166 Discharge plan\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional\ncare, all of the following information shall be\ndocumented in the case record within 14 days after\ndischarge:\n(a) The date of and reason for discharge, and the\nnew location of the child.\n(b) A brief summary or other documentation of the\nservices provided while in residence, including\nmedical and dental services.\n(c) An assessment of the resident’s needs that\nremain to be met.\n(d) Any services that will be provided by the facility\nafter discharge.\n7",
    "(e) A statement that the discharge plan\nrecommendations, including medical and dental\nfollow up that is needed, have been reviewed\nwith the resident and with the parent and with the\nresponsible case manager.\n(f) The name and official title of the person to whom\nthe resident was discharged.\nTwo of two closed youth files reviewed lacked a discharge plan covering\nsubsections (a) through (f).\nCCI Rule 400.4166 Discharge plan\n(2) For an unplanned discharge, an institution shall\nprovide a brief summary or other documentation of\nthe circumstances surrounding the discharge.\nOne of two closed youth files had an unplanned discharge as the youth was\nAWOL when discharged. There is no documentation regarding the circumstances.\nCCI Rule 400.4167 Case record maintenance\n(1) The institution shall maintain a case record for each\nresident.\n(2) Service plans shall be signed and dated by the\nsocial services worker and the social services\ns upervisor.\nThree of eight youth files reviewed lacked a complete file at the time of review as\ndocumentation was missing, including treatment plans and medical information.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The agency was reminded a \"new hire\" consists of employees not hired\nunder the facility's license even if they already work for Bethany Christian\nServices, which includes promotions within the overarching agency of\nBethany Christian Services. Therefore, a new hire protocol should be\nestablished for employees who fall under these categories to ensure all\nlicensing rules for new hires are complied with.\n• The facility should be completing quarterly file reviews (as established in\nthe 2023 Renewal audit CAP) to ensure compliance with licensing rules,\nspecifically treatment plan signatures by youth, workers, and supervisors.\n• The facility should develop a process to ensure discharge plans are being\ncompleted for discharged youth. This should include a process for\nproviding a summary on unplanned discharges.\n8",
    "• Variance requests must be submitted and approved prior to hiring or\npromoting a candidate into a position. It is not acceptable to submit a\nvariance after hiring has already occurred. If there are questions as to\nwhether someone meets the qualifications required in licensing rules, the\nfacility can clarify with their assigned DCWL Consultant prior to hire.\n• The current Assistant Supervisor signed a job description upon hire stating\nshe would serve as the Unit Supervisor in their absence. However, the\nAssistant Supervisor does not meet the requirements of Rule\n400.4120(1)(a) as she does not have experience working in a child caring\ninstitution. Therefore, the agency was asked to alter the job description to\nremove that language. They provided the updated, signed job description\non 2/1/24.\n• The facility has stated more than once the reasons for some of these non-\ncompliances are because they are meeting ORR requirements, but not\nconsidering licensing requirements. To maintain licensing for this facility\nunder the State of Michigan, licensing rules must be followed regardless of\nany contractor requirements.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• It is recommended the description on the observation log to be updated.\nThe form can be confusing as it notes “On school days visual checks begin\nat 9pm and continue until 7am the following morning. On non-school days\nobservation will continue until 9am.” When youth are asleep or otherwise\noutside of direct supervision of staff, staff must perform variable interval,\neye-on checks of the youth. The time between the variable interval checks\nshall not exceed 15 minutes.\n• Audit lists for closed youth should not be reflective of their placement\nhistory. For example, if a youth is AWOL for 3 days, the youth should not\nshow up as “closed” when AWOL started and admitted when they return\nfrom AWOL. If the youth was not officially discharged from the facility, they\nare not considered to be a new admission per licensing rules when they\nreturn.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had one CAP as a result of their 2023 Renewal audit. During the 2023\nrenewal audit, violations were found for dental exams, physical exams, initial\n9",
    "treatment youth plan signatures, initial treatment plan supervisor signatures,\nupdated treatment plan youth signatures, updated treatment plan supervisor\nsignatures, criminal background checks for staff prior to employment, maintaining a\nfull employee file, and staff orientation prior to assuming duties. The facility made\nprogress with compliance with dental exams, physical exams, and criminal\nbackground checks for staff prior to employment. Technical assistance is being\nprovided surrounding the facility having a complete employee file, as the\nrecommendations made during the Renewal audit were not fully implemented. Out\nof the nine violations in the 2023 renewal audit, there are five repeat violations for\nthe current interim audit. The facility did not implement the quarterly file reviews\nlisted as an action step on the 2023 Renewal CAP. All of the quarterly file review\nsheets located in the files were blank. On 2/2/24, Chief Administrator reported the\nprevious program director was responsible for handling and overseeing CAP\ndissemination and he wasn't sure how she did that or who she provided the\ninformation to.\nThe second CAP was a result of SIR2023C0000713 (dated 10/4/23). The violations\nfor SIR2023C0000713 were regarding falsification of documentation related to\nyouth interval checks and staff not completing random interval checks on youth as\nrequired. The facility has made progress regarding falsification of documentation as\nthe facility implemented a new computer system to document the checks, which\nrequires staff to document their checks electronically. As a result, the system\nautomatically enters the time the staff completed the checks when they enter their\nnotes. In addition, random checks have been completed by the supervisor and\nprogram director to ensure random interval checks are being documented at the\nappropriate times as verified by camera footage. Unfortunately, the facility has not\nimproved in the area of compliance with interval checks being completed as\nrequired per the rule.\nFinancial Overview\nAfter a review of the facility's budget and financial audit, there were no financial\nconcerns noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\n10",
    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted staff turnover has been the greatest challenge and\nimpediment to contract and licensing compliance. CA stated with high turnover,\nthey lack the stability and knowledge of veteran staff. He noted this facility has\nundergone staffing changes for the program director, case management\nsupervisor, program supervisor and case manager during the period of review. CA\nnoted a couple focus areas emerged because of the 2023 renewal audit. Those\nareas included a regular review of policies and overall contract compliance being\nmade an integral part of regular supervision, additional trainings for case managers\nand youth specialists, and human resources reviewing/increasing wages for youth\nspecialists and case managers. CA noted the increase in review of expectations\nand additional trainings reportedly were having a positive impact on the staff and\nprogram. However, the resignation of the unit supervisor and case management\nsupervisor impacted training efforts. CA noted they are going to continue to work to\nstabilize staffing, increasing the longevity of staffing and increasing expectations of\nsupervisors holding their direct reports more accountable for licensing rules. CA\nreported bi-weekly team meetings and monthly direct care staff meetings will\ncontinue to occur throughout the year. During the meetings, staff will review policies\nand procedures, receive specialized training related to working with refugee youth,\nmake enhancement to facility programming, and ensure high quality service\nprovision at all levels. The program has also received approval for, and will be\nposting, a Quality Assurance position that will assist supervisors and the director in\nall aspects of daily monitoring and evaluation of the practices outlined.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported new supervisors have led to some adjustments, both good and bad.\nStaff reported it's difficult to get used to new expectations and standards for each\nnew leader. However, staff report communication and expectations are clearer, and\nthey feel there is more accountability. Staff feel the new supervisors are invested in\nlearning about the program, rules, and policies. Staff also feel the supervisors are\nopen to ideas and feedback regarding changes to current practices. Staff feel they\nhave enough support and training to complete their positions. Supervisors report\nstaff are great at communicating through TEAMS. Supervisors both reported they\nare trying to learn about the staff and program since they are new. Supervisors feel\nstaff are very invested in helping them learn, the program, and youth.\nYouth reported they feel safe at the facility. Two out of three youth reported they felt\nthey could go to staff if they needed something or had any concerns. One youth\nreported she did not feel comfortable because she was new and didn't know staff\nwell enough yet. They all reported they like the food and there is enough food\nprovided. They all reported staff are nice to them. The only frustration expressed\nfrom youth was an inability for any of them to do independent outings right now.\nThey reported they did not understand why independent outings were cancelled\nand want more freedom. This issue was discussed with supervisor and\nadministration.\n11",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility occurred on 1/30/24 and there were no safety\nconcerns noted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMarch 4, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 5, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n12"
