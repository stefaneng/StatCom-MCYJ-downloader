Complainant X reported\n4",
    "Youth 1’s medication is for GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) and one of\nher medication is Prilosec. Complainant X reported notwithstanding the agency’s\nreports of keeping all medication locked, this is an independent living program and\nYouth 1 wants to keep her medication in her room. Complainant X said there was a\nfamily team meeting recently and this issue was brought up, but Case Manager E\nwill not do anything about it.\nIndependent Living Director B\nOn 7/5/2022, and 7/18/2022 I spoke with Independent Living (IL) Director B by\ntelephone regarding this allegation. IL Director B also reported information about this\nallegation during an onsite visit on 7/28/2022. IL Director B advised that youths are\nresponsible for taking their own medications. He also advised that medication is kept\nlocked in the office for all youths; the staff alerts the youth of the medication time and\nthen gives it to the youth. The medication is not dispensed, but rather given to the\nyouth to take. He reported following an incident in the past where a youth tried to\noverdose on her psychotropic medication, the agency started locking all youths’\nmedications up as a safety precaution. He acknowledged keeping all medication\nlocked is not written in the policy, but it is something they do for protection. He\nreported as it relates to Youth 1, staff reported they were trying to wake Youth 1 so\nshe could take her medication, but Youth 1 refused to get up. He said it was not\nclear to staff that they could leave Youth 1’s medication out, so they did not. He\nreported there was an FTM around this matter; and during that meeting Case\nManager E reported Youth 1’s refusals to wake up. At that meeting Youth 1’s\nattorney/GAL (Guardian Ad Litem) reported the agency would not be held\nresponsible for Youth 1 refusing if Youth 1 held on to her medication. Therefore, they\nhave since provided the medication to Youth 1 for her to keep in her room.\nYouth and staff interviews:\nYouth 1(age 16), Youth 2(age 16), Youth 3(age 16), Staff C, Staff D, Staff F, and\nStaff G were interviewed about this allegation. All the staff, as well as, Youth 1, and\nYouth 3 (who also reported taking medication for GERD and sleep), affirmed the\ninformation IL Director B reported related to youths’ medication being kept locked.\nNeither of these youths, nor the IL workers knew what policy specifically indicates\nrelated to medication storage or administration.\nYouth 1\nI interviewed, Youth 1 during an onsite IL home visit on 7/6/2022. Youth 1 reported\nher medications as Prilosec, and Zyrtec, which she takes twice daily; as well as\nMiraLAX for constipation, which is taken as needed. She said all of her medications\nare over the counter. She reported getting her medication in the\nafternoons/evenings, but not in the morning on Wednesday and Saturday. She\nreported having asked Case Manager E to allow her to keep her medications in her\nroom since her admission to the program; only to be told for safety precaution she\ncould not. Youth 1 reported, prior to this placement, she was responsible for her\nown medication. She reported the midnight staff person is supposed to wake her\nbefore they leave at 7:00am to give her the medication. She reported staff have\n5",
    "claimed they tried to wake her, but that is not true because she is a light sleeper.\nShe admitted there may have been one such occasion. She reported there is no\nstaff present on Saturday to provide medication.\nYouth 2 and Youth 3\nBoth of these youths were interviewed by me onsite at an IL home visit on 7/6/2022.\nYouth 2 reported not being aware of youths’ medications being locked because she\nis not on medication. Neither she nor Youth 3 had specific information about this\nallegation.\nStaff C and Staff D\nStaff C and Staff D were interviewed by me onsite at an IL home visit on 7/6/2022.\nStaff C is a morning (7:00am-3:00pm) IL worker (except Saturday when she works\nsecond shift- 3:00pm-11:00pm) and Staff D works the second shift. Both of these IL\nworkers reported the third shift staff, not the afternoon shift, is involved in ensuring\nthat youths are given their medication for consumption.\nStaff C reported Youth 1 told her on more than one occasion in June of 2022 that\nstaff were not giving her medication on Wednesday and Saturday. Staff C told Youth\n1 to talk with Case Manager E. She gave Youth 1 Case Manager E’s and IL Director\nB’s telephone number, advising Youth 1 that Staff C could not do anything about this\nsituation.\nStaff D reported that any deviation from their rule, where a youth is allowed to have\ntheir medication in their room, had been done on a case-by-case basis. Staff D\nreported not personally experiencing this, but reported hearing that staff were\nknocking on Youth 1’s door to wake and give Youth 1 her medications, but Youth 1\nwould not wake up. Staff D reported seeing that information in their staff daily log\nbook. Staff D showed me that daily log book for review.\nCase Manager E and Staff F\nCase Manager E and Staff F were interviewed by me via telephone on 7/13/2022\nand 7/21/2022 respectively. This case manager and IL worker, also both reported\nwhat other agency staff persons reported about the agency’s medication protocol of\nlocking up medication and the reason for it.\nCase Manager E reported Youth 1’s GERD medication as being\nOmeprazole/Prilosec (20mg twice daily) and Zyrtec (10mg- once daily). The\nmedication was initially over the counter until she took Youth 1 to get a prescription\non 6/9/2022. As for Youth 1 not getting these medications on Wednesday and\nSaturday, or as required, Case Manager E reported what other staff reported about\nthird shift staff giving the medication to the Youth 1 and reports of Youth 1, at times,\nnot waking up to take the medication from the staff. Case Manager E acknowledged\nnot being onsite during those times, and reporting what had been reported to her.\n6",
    "Staff F acknowledged being the primary third shift staff (11:00pm-7:00 am). She said\nyouth medications are usually given out during second shift (3:00pm-11:00pm)\nbefore she arrives. She said the youth is to come and get the medication from the\nstaff. Staff F reported she only provides youths their medication if the second shift\nworker informs her that staff did not do so. On those occasions, Staff F reported she\ngoes to the youth’s room and tell the youth to come take their medication. Staff F\nreported knowing Youth 1 has GERD, but not what medications Youth 1 takes for it.\nShe reported, she just unlocks the medication cabinet, and the youth grabs the\nmedication from her. She did not report being aware of Youth 1 missing any\nmedication doses. She said when she arrives for her shift the youths have usually\ntaken their medications and are in bed.\nStaff G\nStaff G reported working a split shift, whereby by she works two first shift days, one\nsecond shift day, and two third shift days. She reported three or four weeks prior to\nthis interview the agency did not have a first shift (7:00am-3:00pm) staff person on\nWednesday and Saturday. Therefore, second or third shift staff were responsible for\nhaving the youth to come take their medication. She said during second shift there\nwere multiple occasions, (she clarified that to be at least three times) she knocked\non Youth 1’s door to have Youth 1 come get her medication; and Youth 1 did not.\nYouth 1 had later reported she heard Staff G but did not answer. Therefore, on those\noccasions, Youth 1 did not get her AM medications. Staff G said Youth 1 was\nrecently given the okay to keep her medication in her room. Staff G said prior to that\nshe had started getting Youth 1’s AM medication to hold, so that when Youth 1 came\nto get Youth 1’s PM medication, she also gave her the AM to take later. Staff G\nagreed it was true the documentation that the medication was handed out may not\nbe there in the log. She advised that was because after she knocked on Youth 1’s\ndoor and did not get an answer, she left the job and went home because it was the\nend of her shift. Staff G did not know if the third shift worker, Staff F had\nexperienced similar behavior with Youth 1 related to getting the medication to Youth\n1.\nReviewed:\nYouth 1’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• Youth 1 is a temporary court ward.\n• She had an intake interview and was placed at Samaritas IL home on\n5/13/2022.\n• Youth 1’s intake package, inclusive of an initial assessment, initial\nbudget, IL plus plan and IL contracts and proof Youth 1 received a\ncopy of the agency’s IL handbook and medication agreement.\nThe agency ‘s Medication Agreement which indicated:\n• “For many youth in Independent Living Plus, medications are an important\ncomponent of their independent living plan.\n• Some youth enter the program with medications prescribed by a previous\nphysician. Some youth are prescribed medications after they enter the\n7",
    "program. Either way, it is essential that medications are managed by a\nphysician, taken exactly as prescribed and disposed of properly.\n• If you have any concerns regarding your medications, you need to\naddress them with the prescribing physician. You may not begin, stop, or\nalter the dosage of any medication that is prescribed by a physician\nwithout consulting with the prescribing physician and informing the IL Plus\nCoordinator of the change.\n• As a youth participating in the Independent Living Plus Program with\nSamaritas, I agree to cooperate with the case plan which includes the\nadministration, monitoring and proper disposal (in consultation with a\npharmacist), of all medications for me. I agree to discuss any questions\nand/or concerns regarding my medication with my physician and\ncaseworker. At no time, will I begin, stop, or alter the dosage of any\nmedication or prevent its use without written documentation from the\nmonitoring physician. Any written documentation shall be shared with the\nAgency.”\nThe medical agreement does not indicate anything related to the agency locking,\nstoring or administering a youth’s medication.\nThe staff’s daily log for third shift entries from 5/15/2022 until 7/1/2022(the day after this\ncomplaint. The log entries showed:\n• Numerous entries did not report information on medication; nor whether or not\nYouth 1 took her medication. One entry indicated the staff knocked on Youth 1’s\ndoor and there was no answer.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12502 Program statement.\n(1) An agency shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement that includes all of the following\ninformation:\n(g) medical and dental care.\n8",
    "ANALYSIS: Youth 1 was not consistently provided her GERD medication\ntwice daily as required. All staff interviewed reported it is the\nagency’s rule and or protocol to keep all youth medications\nlocked up, which the third shift staff provides to the youth. The\nagency’s policy does not indicate these protocols.\nAdditionally, there is not a clear or consistent system in place to\naccurately illustrate that a youth is capable of administrating\ntheir medication. Nor how medication administration/ assistance\nis documented. Staff D a second shift IL worker reported the\nadministration of Youth 1’s medication was to be documented\nby the third shift IL worker in the staff’s daily log. Conversely\nStaff F, the third shift IL worker reported she would only provide\nthe youth’s medication if the second shift IL worker informed her\nthey had not. A review of the staff’ daily log had inconsistent\ndocumentation about medication administration and did not\nshow/define what specific medication was given or handed to\nthe youth.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\n(1) Youth 1 has allergies and GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) and is not\nbeing provided appropriate foods needed for her diet.\n(2) Youth 1 did not come to the agency with a medical passport and the agency did\nnot seek one to know and ensure Youth 1’s dietary needs are met.\n(3) The agency has not timely assisted Youth 1 in obtaining food stamps/a bridge\ncard.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant X\nOn 6/30/2022 I spoke with Complainant X about the allegation by telephone.\nComplainant X reported Youth 1 is not being fed the special diet of foods Youth 1\nneeds for her digestive disorder GERD. Complainant X did not clarify what those\nfoods are but reported Youth 1 reported her foods are mixed with the other youths\nand she does not get what she needs. The other youths will consume it all and the\nagency does not buy enough. The agency only purchases $100-$150 in groceries\nevery two weeks. Youth 1 does not have any way to go buy her food. Youth 1’s\nmother provides Youth 1 with Door Dash food gift cards to assist Youth 1 with buying\nfood.\nComplainant X also reported via a written complaint document that: Youth 1 went to\nthe IL home on 5/13/2022; and the agency did not obtain a copy of Youth 1’s medical\npassport to know Youth 1’s GERD and allergy needs. Nor has Youth 1’s food stamps\ncome through timely. Complainant X acknowledged she does not know the reason\nwhy Youth 1’s food stamps were delayed, only that the agency has not made\n9",
    "arrangements to get Youth 1 the adequate food Youth 1 needs.\nIndependent Living Director B\nOn 7/5/2022, and 7/18/2022 I spoke with Independent Living (IL) Director B by\ntelephone. He also provided information to me via email on 7/7/2022. IL Director B\nreported the agency orders food for the youths every two weeks, and as needed\nshould issues come up. He advised this is an independent living program. All the\ngirls in this IL home have bridge cards which they can purchase food with. Case\nManager E assists all the girls in applying for a bridge care when they first arrive at the\nhome. Additionally, all the girls receive a monetary monthly stipend, which they use for\ntheir needs. He reported the agency personally pays for one meal per day, and one\nmeat per week for the youths. Their second shift IL worker, Staff D is the person who\nworks with youths (Which as of 7/5/2022 consisted of Youth 1 and three other youths)\naround the grocery orders. Staff D will ask each youth for food items they want or feel\nthey need.\nOn 7/7/2022, IL Director B provided four grocery receipts (dated 5/13/2022, 5/26/2022,\n6/15/2022 and 7/1/2022) that were orders since Youth 1’s placement. The receipts\nshowed food purchases and items connected to Youth 1 GERD and allergy needs, such\nas almond milk, fruits, meats (chicken, ground beef), noodles, cereal. He said Youth 3\nalso has GERD and food items are purchased for both of these youths.\nIL Director B further reported that after it came to his attention, maybe via this\ncomplaint, that someone was reportedly taking Youth 1’s specific dietary foods, he\nadvised Youth 1 he would purchase her a mini refrigerator for her room. He\nsubsequently did so. He advised that the kitchen refrigerator is a community one for the\nhouse/all youths; and staff cannot guard it all the time. IL Director B reported Youth 1\n“is not malnourished”, her food needs are met.\nIL Director B reported Youth 1’s dietary issues, restrictions were discussed during her\nplacement intake; and they are in her records, inclusive of a past medical passports,\nwhich became accessible to the agency. He reported Case Manager E assists all youth\nin obtaining a bridge card and did so for Youth 1.\nYouth 1\nYouth 1 was interviewed onsite at the IL home on 7/6/2022. Youth 1 reported the\nspecial diet she is on due to her GERD is that “I cannot eat paste like foods, certain\nsauces or acidic foods and drinks”. She said she is also lactose intolerant; and she\nmust eat foods high in fiber. Youth 1 reported she just received her bridge card; and\nbefore that she had no way to buy her food. She admitted the agency buys almond milk\nand other foods for her special diet. The problem is that Youth 3 who also has GERD,\nmany times was using up all the food; and the staff said they could not control what the\nother girls were taking from the refrigerator. Youth 1 reported the agency should have\nbought more food than they had, and there would not have been a problem.\n10",
    "Youth 1 admitted to being involved in the ordering of food; that she and other youths\nmeet with Staff D around a grocery list, and Staff D orders the food. She added that\nwhat Staff D orders, at times depends on what youth Staff D listens to. I asked Youth 1\nwhat food she had asked for which were ordered, and she stated, almond milk, noodles\nfor pasta salad, fruit (melon and strawberries). She could not identify any specific foods\nthat had not been purchased for her. She added that all the meals the group plans, she\ncannot eat such as pizza and Mexican food. She said there is food in the house, but she\nrefuses to eat it. She asked her mother for door dash cash so she can get the foods she\nwants.\nYouth 1 reported the agency told her about the process for how to apply for a food\nassistance bridge card. She said the agency assisted her in applying for one on her\nfirst day at the IL home. She reported, however, Case Manager E never told her how\nlong the process would take. She reported receiving her EBT ((Electronic Benefit\nTransfer) card one to two weeks prior to my interview with her.\nYouth 2 and Youth 3\nYouth 2 and Youth 3 were interviewed by me onsite at the IL home on 7/6/2022. Neither\nyouth knew specifics related to Youth 1’s special diet/ needs. They reported general\ninformation related to the IL home’s food shopping/purchasing, and the process they\nexperienced with getting a bridge card.\nYouth 2 reported being unsure of how often food is purchased for the home but\nadmitted to having a bridge card to purchase food. She said she applied for the bridge\ncard on her own with assistance from Youth 1, not Case Manager E. She affirmed\nYouth 1’s reporting of the youths getting together to decide what to order; and Staff D\nordering the food. She said Staff D is the main person working to get them what they\nneed.\nYouth 3 said the agency orders food every two-three weeks and they have their EBT\ncards. The latter of which Case Manager E helped her apply for. She said getting\napproved for the bridge card took about one to two weeks. She reported not being on a\nspecial diet. She said she just cannot have milk, oranges or strawberries. She affirmed\nthat for groceries they talk about what they want as a group. Staff D then gets pretty\nmuch what they asked for. Youth 3 said the food is gone in about a week and the staff\ncalls Case Manager E and reports that. She said they also have their bridge card to\nuse for food, but the problem is the neighborhood is not so safe; and getting to the\nstore.\nStaff C, Staff F and Staff G\nStaff C was interviewed by me about this allegation onsite on 7/6/2022. Staff F was\ninterviewed by me via telephone on 7/21/2022; and Staff G by me onsite on 7/28/2022.\nAll three IL workers reported not being involved in food ordering. Staff G reported\nknowing that Staff D is responsible for ordering groceries, which is delivered to the\nhome; and that Staff D asks each youth for items they want her to purchase. Staff G\n11",
    "was aware of items, like almond milk, and lactose type cheese being purchased for\nYouth 1 and Youth 3.\nStaff C, Staff F nor Staff G had information related to the allegations pertaining to Youth\n1’s medical passport and bridge card application.\nStaff D\nStaff D was interviewed by me onsite on 7/6/2022. She affirmed information reported by\nothers related to her getting the residents together to discuss the grocery list, and her\nordering or arranging the ordering of food. She reported an awareness of Youth 1 and\nYouth 3’s dietary needs due to their lactose intolerance and special food issues. She\ntries to get enough food for both within the IL house’s budget. She advised they spend\n$150.00- $250.00 every two weeks depending on the number of girls in the home at the\ntime (when only one youth is in the home they have ordered food every three weeks)\nThe foods they purchase is in providing the agency’s one meal a day (usually dinner)\nand sides. There is never a time that there is no food in the home, but it may be that it is\nfoods the girls do not want; and the girls do complaint about it. When that occurs, Staff\nD tries to work with the girls on preparation of dishes with the items that are there. The\nyouths cook their own food. Staff D assists the girls with food preparation when the girls\nhave struggles cooking. Staff D said when the food gets low she reaches out to Case\nManager E and or IL Director B to request to order more food. The request approval\nhappens within two to three days. The girls also have their bridge cards to purchase\nfood. When she orders food, Youth 1 asks for and is provided items such as almond\nmilk, fruits, noodles, and ingredients to make her own paste sauce. Staff D admitted\nthere had been a time when Youth 3 utilized the bulk of the smaller carton of almond\nmilk, even those it was labeled for Youth 1. Staff D reported the items were in the\nkitchen refrigerator which is hard to regulate against access. Staff D tried to remedy that\nproblem by increasing the size of the milk.\nStaff D was not aware anything to do with Youth 1’s medical passport issue or Youth 1\nhaving a problem getting her EBT card. Staff D reported knowing that sometimes the\nfood stamp process is delayed due to the state.\nCase Manager E\nCase Manager E was interviewed about these allegations by me via telephone on\n7/13/2022. Case Manager E reported information similar to IL Director B and Staff D\nrelated to grocery ordering timeframes, spending totals, and Staff D’s role/responsibility\nrelated to grocery shopping and interaction with the youths around that. Case Manager\nE reported Youth 1 has participated in the discussions with Staff D on food orders. She\nsaid dietary items of food is purchased for Youth 1. She reported Youth 1 will often say\nthere is no food at the IL home; though, there is chicken, spaghetti or special cheese\nand milk Youth 1 requested. She said, Youth 1 will also say she is hunger but will not\neat the food onsite; or Youth 1 will decide to eat a peanut butter sandwich. She said\nYouth 1 will request food cards from Youth 1’s mother, so Youth 1 can order fast foods\nYouth 1 wants at a given time; not because there is not food in the home.\n12",
    "Case Manager E reported Youth 1’s medical passport was not included in the referral\npackage as is usually the case with a referral package. She reported participating in the\nplacement intake for Youth 1. She recalled the Family Community Service agency\nwhere Youth 1 was coming from advocating for Youth 1. That agency informed her of\nYouth 1’s GERD diagnosis, lactose intolerance and medications needs and issues. One\nof, the GERD medication, Zyrtec was over the counter at that time and remained so,\nuntil Case Manager E took Youth 1 for a refill prescription on 6/9/2022. The information\nrelating to Youth 1, GERD and allergy needs were shared and documented on Youth\n1’s intake paperwork dated 5/13/2022. After Youth 1’s intake the agency accessed\nYouth 1’s current medical passport in MISACWIS.\nCase Manager E denied the allegation related to the agency not assisting Youth 1 with\nobtaining a bridge card timely. She assisted Youth 1 in applying for the bridge card at\nthe intake on 5/13/2022. She checked the status of Youth 1’s case on 5/26/2022 and\n6/2/2022. On 6/27/2022, by way of assistance from Youth 1’s DHHS Purchase of\nService (POS) worker, Case Monitor X0, Case Manager E learned that Youth 1 was\nofficially approved for food assistance on 6/2/2022. Youth 1 was advised of that on\n6/27/2022. Case Manager E reported for some reason, the approval notification was\nnot sent out for two weeks. Youth 1 received the EBT card the first week of July 2022.\nCase Manager E advised prior to Youth 1 receiving her funds, the agency paid for\nYouth 1’s food. She reported after a youth receives their EBT card, the agency pays for\none meal a day; but no a youth is ever denied food if they do not have food.\nReviewed\n• Receipts from IL Director B as referenced earlier in this section.\n• Youth 1’s intake paperwork and MISACWIS medical passport.\n➢ The intake paper work showed Youth 1 was referred to the agency on\n4/25/2022.

Complainant X reported Youth 1 was not\nprovided transported back to the facility after Youth 1 was involved in a dangerous\nincident with Youth 1’s former boyfriend while on a visit with Youth 1’s adult half-\nbrother’s mother in Lake Orion. Per Complainant X the former boyfriend aimed his\ncar at Youth 1 and in the process knocked out power in the complex. Complainant X\nreported the agency case worker threatened Youth 1. The case worker told Youth 1,\n(who had no way back to the facility because the adult half-brother’ mother does not\ndrive) if Youth 1 did not return to the facility she would be cited as in violation of her\ncurfew. Youth 1 also needed help with filing the PPO against the former boyfriend\nand the agency has not provided that assistance.\nIL Director B\nOn 7/5/2022 and 7/18/2022 I spoke with Independent Living (IL) Director B by\ntelephone regarding these allegations. IL Director B also reported information about\nthe allegations during an onsite visit with him on 7/28/2022. IL Director L denied the\nallegations. He reported Youth 1 never requested transportation after the incident\nwith her male friend, which occurred in another city during Youth 1 visit with her\nbrother. He said Youth 1 never called for transportation. Youth 1 told the agency\nstaff about the incident after the fact. Additionally, Youth 1’s GAL did not want Youth\n1 to come back to the IL home then, and there was a safety connection. He reported\nCase Manager E had more details about that incident. He advised in general the\nagency does not necessarily provide transportation for the youth to personal events\nor functions the youth may attend. The agency provides bus passes to the youths.\n15",

She said she wanted to return to the IL home the night of the incident, but\nshe had no way to return. Youth 1 said she told Case Manager E she had no way to\ncome back to the IL home and Case Manager E told her the agency does not\nprovide transportation. Conversely, Youth 1 reported, the police wanted her to stay,\nwith her brother out of concern the boyfriend might follow her back to the IL home.\nThe police also advised her to file a PPO. Case Manager E also extended her\nweekend pass to Wednesday and told her to file the PPO where her brother lives.\nYouth 1 reported it was not that the agency needed to take her to file the PPO.

Youth 1 reported she had contacted\nStaff F prior; and Case Manager E reported that contact was neither affirmed nor\ndenied. Case Manager E admitted she advised Youth 1 that Youth 1 needed to\nreturn to the IL home. Additionally, she advised Youth 1 she would assist Youth 1\nwith the PPO. Youth 1 asked what if she needed to go to court, and she told Youth 1\nshe would take Youth 1 to any court hearing Youth 1 needed to attend. All this was\nbeing discussed at or around the FTM on 6/27/2022, and Youth 1’s GAL asked,\n“what if you gave her an extra day to be with family, who would help her with the\nPPO”.

She reported Staff C had said something to Youth 1 about Detroit\nmusic, but what specifically, Youth 3 could not recall. She reported knowing the\nDetroit comment meant something about Black people. Youth 3 acknowledged that\nshe did not hear Staff C say anything negative about Black people or anything\nnegative about Youth 1 being Black.\nYouth 3 reported Staff C told her not to give Youth 1 her check, because Youth 1\nonly wants to help her for the money.

She reported their relationship to be a” little rocky at\ntimes”, and that sometimes it is hard to get along with Youth 1.

That is\nwith the exception of an incident whereby it was shown that Staff F was not\nconsistently inside the home during her midnight shift one time in December 2021.\nStaff F was admittedly outside in her car, attending to a dog, she had brought to\nwork with her. Staff F was disciplined for that incident.\nIL Director B reported the agency does not have an employee time\nclock, and in an effort to better monitor IL worker’s attendance, and after the\nDecember incident, an IL staff worker’s phone protocol was established. The IL\nworker must contact him from the IL home’s cell phone upon that IL worker\narriving on and departing the site.

    "IL Director B\nI spoke with IL Director B regarding the FTM allegation on 7/5/2022 by telephone,\nand the GAL visitation allegation by telephone on 7/18/2022 and onsite during an IL\nhome visit on 7/28/2022. IL Director B confirmed that an FTM occurred on\n6/27/2022. Case Manager E scheduled that meeting and invited the GAL. During\nthe meeting Case Manager E was attempting to call the GAL to check on if the GAL\nwould be attending, but Youth 1 contacted the GAL first. IL Director B recalled the\nGAL reporting the GAL was having problems with her email.\nIL Director B reported no one denied the GAL a visit with Youth 1. He reported that\nduring the 6/27/2022 FTM, the GAL mentioned visiting on a specific date. Case\nManager E told the GAL Youth 1 was not going to be at the IL home, but the GAL\nshowed up anyway. When the GAL arrived at the IL home, Staff C, who would not\nhave known who the GAL is answered the door. All Staff C did was tell the GAL that\nYouth 1 was not there, but the GAL reported she was denied entry.\nCase Manager E\nCase Manager E was interviewed by me by telephone on 7 /13/2022. Case\nManager E affirmed the information reported by IL Director B related to the FTM and\nthe GAL’s visit.\nCase Manager E reported IL Director B, Youth 1, DHHS Monitor X0, and the GAL\nwere involved in the 6/27/2022 FTM. She sent out invitations for the FTM on Friday\nfor the meeting. She obtained the email address for the GAL from DHHS Monitor\nX0. This email correspondence was Case Manager E’s first with the GAL. During\nthe FTM the GAL reported she was having a problem with her email and provided a\nnew email address.\nCase Manager E emailed me a copy of the Zoom FTM invite sent to the GAL\nadvising the GAL of the FTM. The Zoom invited was dated for Friday 6/24/2022 for\nan FTM on Monday 6/27/2022.\nCase Manager E reported that during the FTM on 6/27/2022 there was discussion\nrelated to Youth 1 needing to complete a PPO; and the GAL’s advisement the PPO\nshould be filed in the city/county where the incident occurred (as discussed earlier in\nthe report). Case Manager E then extended Youth 1’s weekend home pass beyond\nthe original 6/24/2022- 6/26/2022 date so that the relative could assist Youth 1 in\nfiling the PPO with the police. Therefore, Youth 1 was still with the relative on\n6/28/2022 and would not be home. Youth 1 did not return to the IL home until\n6/29/2022.\nIt noteworthy that Youth 1 affirmed during my interview with her on 7/6/2022, she\nwas granted an extension to stay with her relative to execute the PPO; and she did\nnot return to the IL home until the night of 6/29/2022.\n25",
    "Staff C\nStaff C was interviewed onsite on 7/28/2022. She was only interviewed related to the\nallegation that the agency prevented or tried to prevent the GAL’s visit with Youth 1.\nStaff C denied that allegation. She reported the GAL arrived at the IL home; and she\ndid not know the GAL was coming or who the GAL was. When the GAL arrived at\nthe door and asked for Youth 1, Staff C advised the GAL Youth 1 was not home.\nThe GAL asked why when Youth 1 knew the GAL was coming this day. Staff C\nadvised the GAL Youth 1 was on an overnight home pass. The GAL was upset, but\npolite. The GAL reported she had drove a distance and had some food for Youth 1.\nThe GAL gave Staff C the food for Youth 1. Staff C reported the GAL did not ask to\nenter the IL home; and she did not invite the GAL in. Staff C reported she would\nneed to contact the IL Director B and or Case Manager to alert them of the GAL’s\npresent, and obtain approval for the GAL to come in beforehand, because she did\nnot know the GAL.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-6B Family Team Meeting\nThe Family Team Meeting (FTM) is an essential component of\nMiTEAM, Michigan’s Child Welfare Practice Model.

    "ANALYSIS: The youth was not home when the GAL arrived at the IL home,\ndue to the youth being on a home pass with relatives. The\nyouth’s extended stay with the relative was discussed at the\nFTM which the GAL was in attendance at the day before the\nGAL’s home visit.\nThe evidence does not support the allegation of the agency\npreventing or trying to prevent the GAL from visiting the youth.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe foster care worker withheld Youth 1’s check in response to dirty dishes being\nleft in the sink.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant X\nComplainant X reported in a 7/12/2022 allegation document that the worker had\nwithheld Youth 1’s check in response to dirty dishes being left in the sink.\nComplainant X indicated being informed that IL Director B withheld Youth 1’s and\nother youths’ checks for the dirty dishes; and after one youth cleaned the dishes the\nchecks were disbursed that day on 7/11/2022. Complainant X indicated concern with\nwhat happened because Youth 1 needs her check to support herself and to buy\nfood.\nIL Director B\nIL Director B was interviewed about this allegation by me on 7/18/2022 by telephone\nand onsite during an IL home visit on 7/28/2022. IL Director B denied he threatened\nto withhold Youth 1 or other youths’ checks. He expressed concern that Youth 1’s\nGAL was complaining to complain based on information Youth 1 reported that was\nnot correct. He reported concern that Youth 1 was manipulating the GAL because\nYouth 1 does not want to be placed in this IL placement. Additionally, that the GAL\nwas filing court motions without allowing the agency to address the issues the GAL\nraised. He advised that youths’ stipend checks were due on 7/4/2022, but due to\nthe holiday the checks came in late. The checks were disbursed when they came in\non 7/11/2022. He admitted to having a conversation with Staff C and youths about\nchecks around that time. Staff C contacted him regarding youths not completing\nchores; and dishes being piled up in the sink. He advised Staff C to get all the\nyouths together so he could address the matter with all of them via the call. During\nhis talk with the youths, he advised them he was trying to be fair, that they knew it\nwas a part of their responsibilities and contract to complete chores. The youths\nagreed to complete their chores, and one youth agreed to do the dishes. No youth’s\ncheck was withheld.\nStaff C, Youth 2, Youth 3, Youth 4 and Staff G\nI interviewed Staff C, Youth 2, Youth 3, Youth 4 and Staff G about this allegation\nduring an onsite IL home visit on 7/28/2022. Youth 1 had departed the program.\n27",
    "Staff C\nStaff C reported the girls were wondering about their checks and that she called IL\nDirector B. IL Director B asked her how the house looked, and she advised him of\nthe dishes in the sink. Thereon, Staff C affirmed information reported by IL Director\nB related to his communication to the youths, the check arrivals and disbursement\ndate. Staff C reported at the time that IL Director B spoke with the girls, with the\nexception of Youth 1, no youth argued or voiced upset about the incident/what IL\nDirector B advised. No youth’s check was withheld. Staff C was not aware of a\nreason that they could withhold a youth’s check.\nYouth 2\nYouth 2 reported it was not the staff that threatened to withhold their check, it was IL\nDirector B. She affirmed IL Director B speaking with she and the other three youths\nabout chores and the piled-up dishes in the sink. Youth 2 said, “no one was doing\nchores and the house was disgusting, so she understood that, but they need their\nmoney, and their checks should not be withheld”. She said she did not know that\nwas in their contract. She said all, but Youth 1 did their chores, and Youth 4 did the\ndishes so they could receive their checks. They all received their checks; they were\nnot withheld, then. She said her check was threatened again, but she did not say\nwhen that threat occurred or who may the threat.\nYouth 3\nYouth 3 affirmed Youth 2’s reporting. She also said, everyone received their check,\nbut her. She said she has one or two checks that have not been given to her\nbecause of chores. She said she has been on lawn duty for three months. She said\nshe completed this lawn assignment five times; she does not know why they will not\nremove it from her. She now refuses to do it. Youth 3 was not sure of what is a\ncorrect amount for her checks. She reported paying about $208 for rent that is taken\nout of her check before she is due to receive it. She reported getting maybe $598\nmonthly and receiving a payment twice monthly. She reported receiving only one\ncheck from the state in three months.\nYouth 4\nYouth 4 reported checks are threatened to be withheld when the house looks dirty.\nShe said when a youth comes to the program the agency lets the youth know to deal\nwith having to do chores. Her check was threatened the first week she arrived, but it\nwas never taken.\nStaff G\nStaff G recalled Youth 1 complaining about her check during a time Case Manager E\nwas on vacation. That was because the stipend checks were delayed due to the July\n4, 2022, holiday. The checks were given out when they arrived; withholding the\nchecks as a punishment did not occur. Staff G admitted an awareness of IL\nDirector B’s communication with the staff about not passing out the checks until the\nyouths completed their chores. I asked Staff G whether there are occasions that\n28",
    "youths’ checks are withheld, Staff G reported IL Director B advised that there is a\npolicy that allows them to withhold the youth’s check for not completing life skill\nclasses and chores. She reported the IL workers never withhold checks, but if Case\nManager E and or IL Director B calls and advises them to not pass out the check for\nwhatever period of time, they do not pay them out. The longest she recalled a\ncheck being held was two weeks. She reported Youth 3 has three checks withheld,\nwhich had to do with chores, some due with lawn chores; and those checks are in\nthe IL house’s office.\nReviewed\n• I observed four checks in an office book with Youth 3’s name on them, for the\nfollowing::\n➢ Check # 879354- dated, 6/8/2022--- $142.17 (original amount was $\n297.78; $103.74 & $51.87 deducted for rent).\n➢ Check # 879806- dated 6/22/2022--$194.04(original amount was $\n297.78; $103.74 deducted for rent).\n➢ Check #880338- dated 7/6/2022---$194.04 (original amount was $\n297.78; $103.74 deducted for rent).\n➢ Check #880843- dated 7/20/2022---$194.04(original amount was $\n297.78; $103.74 deducted for rent).\n• An IL Agreement/Contract and IL-Plus Plan Agreement for content related to\nwithholding stipends for chores. Information not located in said documents.\n• A chore board which had Youth 3 listed for lawn duty.\n• I spoke IL Director B about this matter once more on 7/29/2022 and again at\npreliminary exit on 8/31/2022. He reported being unaware of the checks\nrelated to Youth 3. He denied Youth 3 being continually assigned to lawn\nduty, and indicated they have someone to do the lawn. He also reported not\nknowing whether Case Manager E had withheld the stated checks for some\nreason. He reported Youth 3 is one of the youths who does not have proper\nidentification to be able to cash her check, but he was not sure whether that\nwas the reason the checks were in the office. He indicated the checks may\nhave been replaced. He reported the agency was working on getting\nidentification for the youths who do not have one. Additionally, that the\nagency has, as recent as July 2022, explored the youths receiving their\nstipend payments by way of debit cards. On 8/2/2022, he provided an email\nto me on the agency’s July 2022 exploration of partnering with Huntington\nBank for youths to participate in a financial learning program.\n29",

At least four of Youth 3’s checks were held for reasons\nnot clearly known. Those checks were stored in the agency’s\nstaff office/book.\nThe evidence supports the allegation of youths’ checks being\nthreatened or held, the latter of which could have impacted on\nthe youth’s financial support to meet the youth’s needs.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nYouth 1 has a broken window in her room with a board over it, and it has been this\nway for several weeks.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant X reported in the 7/12/2022 allegation document that Youth 1 has a\nbroken window in her room with a board over it. The window has been this way for\nseveral weeks. Youth 1’s half-sibling’s foster father noticed the broken window/board\nseveral weeks ago.\nCase Manager E and Staff F were interviewed by me related to this allegation via\ntelephone on 7/13/2022 and 7/21/2022 respectively. Youth 4, Staff D and Staff G\nwere interviewed by me onsite on 7/28/2022.\nThe four staff persons and Youth 4(who has resided at the IL home the longest) all\nreported there had been a break to a window in the room Youth 1 occupied. The\nwindow was broken/smashed by the youth who occupied the room prior to Youth 1’s\nplacement at this IL home and in that room. The window was also repaired back\nwhen it was broken, but the board was left up. No one knew actually why the board\n(which per Staff D was on the inside of the room) had been left up. Nor were any of\nthese individuals sure of when the incident occurred, whether it was almost one year\nago, or February, March 2022 or April 2022.\nOn 7/28/2022 I viewed the room Youth 1 had occupied (Youth 1 no longer resides at\nthis IL home). The room was vacant of a current youth. There were no broken\nwindows. The board had been removed but was still temporarily stored in the room.\n30",

Additionally, that the foster father of\nYouth 1’s sibling picked her up and was appalled because no one asked him for\nidentification.\nIL Director B\nOn 7/28/2022 during an onsite IL home visit I spoke with IL Director B about this\nallegation. He denied the allegation. He reported the agency staff are observance\nand they make efforts to screen the youth’s coming and going; as well as who\ncomes to the home. He reported that youths must provide the staff with a verbal of\nwhere they are going when they leave the home. If the youth is going somewhere on\nthe weekend, they also inform the staff, who checks with Case Manager E to know\nthat there is approval for them to visit the person. This information is documented in\nthe IL home’s log book. IL Director B added that if a person comes to the home to\npick a youth up, this has to be pre-discussed with Case Manager E, who alerts the\nstaff this per will be coming. Once the person comes to the door, the staff asks who\nthey are, alerts the youth who verifies the person. He reported the GAL should know\nfrom her experience coming to the IL home that folks are not just allowed entry, they\nare questioning the person as to who they are.\nYouth 2, Youth 3, Youth 4\nYouth 2, Youth 3 and Youth 4 were interviewed by me onsite on 7/28/2022.

    "Youth 4 said the staff pay attention to who comes to pick them up, “they are good at\nthat”. Youth 4 reported, anyone can show up to the house, but staff do not let\nanyone in. The person coming must have approval, and staff will ask for\nidentification, but typically the person meets the youth on the outside after the youth\nand staff know who it is.\nStaff C, Staff G\nStaff C and Staff G were interviewed about this allegation by me onsite on\n7/28/2022. They too affirmed information as reported by IL Director B and the\nyouths interviewed about this allegation. These two IL workers reported being\nunaware of any person coming for Youth 1 and just allowed access in or to pick up\nYouth 1 without reporting who they were or the youth verifying that.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12503 Policy and procedures.\n(2) An agency shall have and follow written policy and\nprocedures for independent living services provided that\nincludes all of the following:\n(e)Supervision provided by the agency\nANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to support the allegation or a lack\nof supervision\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the facility’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date August 31, 2022\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 7, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n32"
