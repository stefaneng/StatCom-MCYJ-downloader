Staff\nwas terminated, but then allowed back.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Staff 1 was interviewed via phone on 2/13/24.\nStaff 1 reported she no longer works at the facility but talks to staff\nwho work there still. Staff 1 reported they call her to share their\nconcerns because they tell Administrator 2/Licensee Designee\n(LD) and nothing is getting done. Staff 1 reported she was told by\nStaff 2 that Staff 3 was talking to Staff 5 about the situation she\nwas fired for, and Staff 2 overheard the conversation. Staff 1\nreported in October 2022, a youth (couldn’t remember who) was\nlooking for a staff and found Staff 3 having sex with an unknown\nman in the sensory room of the facility. Staff 1 reported\nAdministrator 2/LD fired Staff 3 after the incident, but 3-4 months\nago, Staff 3 was hired back.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed via phone on 2/9/24 and face\nto face at the facility in conjunction with MDHHS Worker on\n2/13/24. Administrator 1 reported in the fall of 2022, she,\nAdministrator 2/LD and the previous Chief Administrator were\nmade aware of a situation where Youth A reported she saw Staff 3\nand an unknown male watching a movie in the sensory room.\nAdministrator 1 reported Staff 3 was interviewed, denied she ever\nhad a male in the home, and refused to sign her termination letter.\nAdministrator 1 reported the facility didn’t have cameras at the\n2",
    "time, so it was a he-said/she-said situation. Administrator 1\nreported a regular staff would not have been fired for the situation\nbased on the information they had. However, Staff 3 is\nAdministrator 1’s daughter, so she was held to a higher standard.\nAdministrator 1 reported Staff 3 was re-hired in August 2023,\nwhich was a team decision made by Administrator 1,\nAdministrator 2/LD, Administrator 3, and the Previous Chief\nAdministrator. Administrator 1 reported Staff 3 was re-hired\nbecause they needed additional staff at the facility, they never had\nany proof the situation occurred, and Staff 3 continued to maintain\nthe reported situation never happened.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone by MDHHS worker on\n2/9/24 and via phone by this Consultant on 2/14/24. Staff 2 told\nMDHHS Worker there was a rumor Staff 3 had sex with a guy who\ndid not work for the facility while she was on shift. Staff 2 reported\nit happened before she started working for the facility, and she\ncould not remember who told her the information. When\ninterviewed by this Consultant, Staff 2 reported Staff 5 told her\nStaff 3 was bragging about how she got fired and was hired back.\nStaff 2 reported she wasn’t working at the time the incident\nallegedly occurred, so she couldn’t answer any other questions.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/13/24\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported in October\n2022, she ordered food to be delivered to the home. When the\ndelivery guy came to drop off the food, she went into the sensory\nroom to get money for the delivery person to pay him and left him\nstanding in the doorway of the facility. When Staff 3 was in the\nsensory room, Youth A woke up, came downstairs and came into\nthe sensory room with her. Staff 3 reported she walked out of the\nsensory room, followed by Youth A, gave the delivery guy the\nmoney, and walked Youth A back upstairs to her room. Staff 3\nreported the delivery guy was never in the sensory room or in the\nfacility. Staff 3 reported she was terminated because the facility\nhad to err on the side of caution and listen to what Youth A said to\nprotect them. Staff 3 reported she never talked to Staff 2 or Staff 5\nabout the circumstances surrounding her being terminated or\nrehired. Staff 3 reported it’s not something she wants to go around\nboasting about because people will get the wrong impression.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at another facility on\n2/15/24 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 reported he\nworked with Staff 3 when he first started working for another\nfacility associated with this facility. Staff 4 remembers Staff 3 was\nfired but doesn’t know why she was fired.

Staff 5 reported she was never told\nanything regarding Staff 3’s employment history with the facility.\nStaff 5 reported she has no knowledge of how long Staff 3 worked\nat the facility, why she left, or how she came back. Staff 5 reported\nshe didn’t tell anyone any information about Staff 3 or her\nemployment history because she doesn’t have any information\nabout Staff 3.\nYouth A was interviewed via video conference on 2/21/24 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported she doesn’t\nremember any staff’s names from the facility. Youth A does not\nremember Staff 3. Youth A reported no one ever came into the\nfacility who didn’t work at the facility. Youth A reported she never\nsaw a male in the sensory room at the facility who didn’t work\nthere. Youth A reported she never saw a female staff member in\nany room, including the sensory room, with a male who didn’t\nwork at the home. Youth A reported she never saw a female staff\nmember watching a movie or having sex with a male inside the\nfacility.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Staff 3’s employee file was reviewed. Staff 3 was\nterminated on 10/17/22. Termination letter states “On\nSaturday, October 15th, [Staff 3] worked the overnight shift\nand had a male inside the Let’s Talk About It Home. This\nmale was not an employee of Let’s Talk About It and thus\nnot authorized to be on the premises.” Staff 3 signed\nverification she read/reviewed the facility’s Code of Ethics\non 8/17/23.\n• Note dated 10/16/22 authored by Administrator 1 was in\nStaff 3’s employee file with her termination letter.\nAdministrator 1 reports a complaint was received from\n[Staff 1] alleging a youth walked into the sensory room and\nsaw [Staff 3] and an unknown male having sex.\nAdministrator 1 met with each of the youth and asked them\nif anything out of the ordinary happened during the\novernight shift, and they all responded no. Administrator 1\nasked the youth if any of them got up and came downstairs\novernight, and all said no except [Youth A]. [Youth A] told\nAdministrator she woke up during the night and came\n4",
    "downstairs to get a drink of water when she saw [Staff 3] in\nthe sensory room watching a movie with a man.\n• Note dated 10/16/22 authored by Administrator 2/LD was in\nStaff 3’s employee file with her termination letter.\n[Administrator 1] received the allegations about [Staff 3]\nfrom [Staff 1], who reported she learned of the information\nfrom [Staff 4]. Administrator 2/LD contacted [Staff 4] to ask\nwhat he knew about the allegations. [Staff 4] stated he did\nnot know what [Staff 1] was talking about and did not know\nanything about [Staff 3] having a male over at the house.\nAdministrator 2/LD spoke with [Staff 3] who stated she had\ngotten hungry and ordered food to be delivered to her.\n[Staff 3] reported she let the delivery person into the home\nto drop off her food, but he did not stay. [Staff 3] denied she\nhad been in the sensory room with him. Administrator 2/LD\nrecommended termination based on the information\nreceived.\n• LTAI Code of Ethics (rev. 3/2023) outlines standards of\nbehavior and ethical judgments to be adhered to by staff. It\nnotes staff must utilize good judgment. Employees are to\nmaintain clear boundaries between their personal and\nbusiness interactions. Employees shall behave in a\nmanner that demonstrates dignity and respect to persons\nserved, staff members, visitors, volunteers & stakeholders.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. There is no evidence Staff 3 had sex\nwith a male at the facility as no youth or staff saw this occur. The\nfacility proceeded with termination of Staff 3 in October 2022 to\nhold her to a higher standard since she’s Administrator 1’s\ndaughter and to err on the side of caution as a safeguard for youth\nserved.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMarch 15, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 19, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
