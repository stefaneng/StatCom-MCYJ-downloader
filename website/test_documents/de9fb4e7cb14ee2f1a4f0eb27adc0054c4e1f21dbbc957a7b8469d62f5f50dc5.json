The investigation was not substantiated and\nwas closed. Youth A does not feel safe around Staff 1. Staff 1 has\nbeen touching Youth A’s mouth with his hand and rubbing Youth\nA’s back in an uncomfortable manner. Complainant was contacted\nby phone on 12/5/24. Complainant stated they did not have any\nknowledge of this occurring but took the proper steps to report\nwhat they were told.\nInterviews:\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on 12/5/24.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) stated she had no knowledge of Staff\n1 touching Youth A. FCW stated Youth A was having a difficult\nweek due to a recent meeting where it was decided Youth A\nwould stay at the facility. Youth A made the allegation regarding\nStaff 1 during the meeting. FCW explained in the meeting an\ninvestigation (2024SIC0001759) was previously completed\nregarding this allegation. After the meeting, Staff 1 asked Youth A\nif there were any new incidents that needed to be investigated.\nStaff 1 stated she could not get the truth out of Youth A, as she\nwould not answer any questions. Youth A would only state that\nshe felt unsafe and would do whatever she needed to get out of\nthe facility. FCW noted she previously discussed the prior\ninvestigation with Youth A on 11/8/24. At that time, Youth A\nindicated she felt safe and had no concerns about the facility.\nFCW emailed DCWL on 12/6/24 after completing a visit with\nYouth A at the facility. FCW reported she had some clarification\nfrom Youth A regarding Staff 1. Youth A told Staff 1 that there was\nnot any new inappropriate touching by Staff 1. What she stated in\nthe meeting was from the allegation in the prior investigation.\n2",
    "Youth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/6/24.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 continued to walk through her unit,\ndespite the prior investigation. Youth A was asked if this was still\noccurring during the evening shift, as Staff 1 was a supervisor and\nneeded to check in with staff periodically as determined in the\nprevious investigation. Youth A said yes. But sometimes Staff 1\nwill sit down and talk with people. Youth A stated she needed to\nbe moved from the facility. Youth A stated she was very upset that\nthere were no findings in the previous investigation. The findings\nwere reviewed with Youth A again and she was asked if there was\nany information that was missed or untrue. Youth A would not\nanswer. Youth A verbalized her anger about not being moved\nafter the first investigation. Youth A was visibly very angry. Youth\nA was asked if there had been any situations with Staff 1 that\nmade her uncomfortable, since the prior investigation. Youth A\nanswered no. Youth A stated that she did not want to be there\nbecause she had issues with a peer. Youth A did not have any\nnew information or allegations regarding Staff 1.\nChief Administrator was contacted via email on 12/9/24. Chief\nAdministrator reported Staff 1 was aware to maintain distance\nfrom Youth A. This would be reiterated with the Unit Manager as\nwell, so as not to put Staff 1 in a position where additional\nallegations could occur. Follow-up occurred via email on 1/26/25.\nChief Administrator confirmed the Unit Manager spoke with Staff 1\nabout maintaining distance and no further concerns have been\nreported.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Safety Plan dated 12/5/24, authored by FCW and signed by\nYouth A. Youth A identified a safe person at Vista Maria to\ndiscuss concerns with. Youth A was provided with phone\nnumbers to report any concerns. Youth A would not be\nalone with Staff 1. Youth A would be staffed 1:1 at all times.\nAnalysis No violation was found as the allegation was previously\ninvestigated and there was no new information presented at this\ntime.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Staff-to-resident-ratio\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127\nSection (3) The ratio formula for direct care workers shall correspond with\nDescription the institution's purpose and the needs of the residents and shall\n3",

Youth A was required to have a 1:1 supervisor from\n7:00am-9:15pm. This supervision was requested by Vista Maria\nstaff and approved by MDHHS. Youth A does not consistently\nhave a 1:1 staff. There is concern this was deemed necessary by\nVista Maria for the safety of Youth A, but the facility is not\nfollowing through.\nInterviews:\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on 12/5/24. FCW\nreported Youth A told her she did not have a 1:1 staff most days.\nFCW stated this would not be the first time the facility has asked\nfor 1:1 staff, then stopped using it without notifying the worker.\nFCW was unsure who would make that determination at the\nfacility. FCW clarified that 1:1 staffing was just approved on\n11/15/24, after Youth A had two incidents of breaking windows\nand injuring staff.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/5/24. It\nwas observed that Youth A had 1:1 staff at that time. When asked\nabout 1:1 staffing, Youth A stated she did not always have staff.\nWhen asked if she recalled any recent dates that she did not have\nstaff, Youth A answered no. Youth A was asked if she had staff\nevery day during the current week, she refused to answer. When\nasked if she had 1:1 staff every day last week, she refused to\nanswer. It was explained to Youth A that the more information she\ncould provide, the easier it would be for DCWL to determine any\nissues and correct them. Youth A was very angry about the\ninvestigation and refused to speak any further.\nRights Officer was contacted via email on 12/6/24 and asked to\nprovide the 1:1 schedule for Youth A from 11/15/24 to 12/6/24.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A’s case record was reviewed regarding service\nplans and requirement for supervision.

Youth A would be staffed 1:1 at all times.\n• The 1:1 staffing schedule for Youth A was reviewed from\n11/12/24- 12/7/24. Youth A was provided 1:1 staff every\nday, except for the afternoons of 11/17/24, 11/18/24 and\n11/23/24.\nAnalysis A violation was found as Youth A was not provided with\nsupervision as outlined in their treatment plan.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(b) The services provided to residents and parents directly by\nthe institution and the services provided by outside resources.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The facility is denying the youth the ability to make phone calls to\nher case manager/MDHHS.\nInvestigation On 12/4/24 Complainant reported the facility was denying Youth\nA the ability to make calls to her caseworker or Centralized Intake.\nYouth A asked to call her worker and was told that she did not\nneed to call her. Youth A was allowed to make calls at times but\nspecifically was denied opportunities to call her caseworker.\nInterviews:\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on 12/5/24. FCW\nwas aware that staff told Youth A she could not make calls if she\nhad already made calls and left messages for FCW. FCW felt that\nwas reasonable as Youth A would otherwise call her ten times or\nso. FCW told Youth A that she only had to leave one message\nand FCW would call her back when she got the message. FCW\nasked Youth A if she were truly being denied phone calls, or was\nshe upset FCW did not call her back fast enough? Youth A would\nnot give an answer. Youth A also complained that youth only get\nan hour to make phone calls. Youth A stated that some phones on\nthe unit were broken a well.\n5",
    "Youth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/6/24.\nYouth A stated that she sometimes could not make calls as staff\nwere busy and told her to hold on but then did not let her make a\ncall until after 5:30pm. Youth A stated that some peers broke the\nphones on the unit. Therefore, supervisors had to bring phones on\nthe unit to make calls. Youth were limited to 10-minute calls each,\nso that everyone was able to complete calls from 7-8:00PM. Youth\nA could not recall any staff that told her she could not call FCW.\nWhen asked of a recent day that she was not allowed to call FCW,\nYouth A stated she did not know.

The logs indicated Youth A made 34 phone calls\nto family members, mentors, and FCW. These calls\noccurred at various times from 3:00PM to 8:59PM.\nAnalysis No violation was found as interviews and documents indicated\nYouth A was able to make phone calls in accordance with agency\npolicy.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
