The facility is in the process of attempting to fill all\nvacant positions and this issue is not expected to be long term. The Chief\nAdministrator addressed the facilities efforts at the CAP activities and notes the\nprogress and success made to this point.

The Quality Assurance aspect of the CAP has been very successful.\nBarriers that influenced the unplanned discharges has been addressed and the\nnumber of unplanned discharges has significantly been reduced. During another\nspecial investigation (2024C0000846SI) with no findings but it was recommended\nthe facility improve their 15-minute overnight bed checks.
