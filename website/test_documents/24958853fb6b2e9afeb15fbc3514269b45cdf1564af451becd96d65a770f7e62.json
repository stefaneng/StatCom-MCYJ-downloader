    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program Statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12502\nSection (1) An agency shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement that includes all the following information: (b) Eligibility\nrequirements for a youth, including age and level of physical,\nemotional, and intellectual functioning and youth not appropriate\nfor the program.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency failed to locate a proper placement for youth after\nAWOL.\nInvestigation On 4/9/25 Complainant reported Youth A, a refugee minor, was\nliving with friends of her brother after running away from Bethany\nChristian Services (BCS). The friends asked Youth A to leave.\nYouth A did not have any local family and did not know where to\ngo. BCS failed to find a new placement for Youth A, leaving Youth\nA at risk of being homeless. Contact occurred with complainant on\n4/9/25. No additional information was reported.\nInterviews:\nChief Administrator was contacted via email on 4/9/25. Chief\nAdministrator stated Program Director had the needed information\nand should be the contact person for the investigation.\nProgram Director was contacted via email on 4/9/25. Program\nDirector (PD) reported he was in contact with MDHHS Worker\nregarding the investigation. A phone interview occurred with PD\non 4/29/25. PD reported Youth A went AWOL in January 2024.\nThe agency’s federal contract with the Office of Refugee\nResettlement (ORR) requires cases to be closed within 48 hours\nof unapproved absence. Bethany closed the case in January\n2024. DCWL requested documentation of Youth A’s discharge\nfrom the program. PD stated he did not believe they had a\ncompleted discharge summary. PD stated when Youth A\ncontacted the agency in April 2025 to find a placement, the\nagency could not place her as the case had been closed. PD\nreported he believed the case responsibility was in the hands of\nthe local MDHHS. PD stated there was a court order when Youth\nA became a temporary court ward in 2023, which stated she was\nunder the care of MDHHS. PD admitted there was some\nconfusion, as the court seemed to believe Youth A was the\n2",
    "responsibility of Bethany, despite the court order and the case\nbeing closed with ORR. Although the agency did not agree with\nthe court, they also did not want to go against the court, and Case\nWorker maintained some contact with Youth A over the past year,\nhelping Youth A find medical care when needed. PD reported\nthere was a court hearing recently, which clarified that case\nresponsibility belonged to MDHHS. MDHHS has since placed the\nyouth.\nCase Worker was contacted by email on 4/29/25 and reported\nshe did not have any additional information. Case Worker\nconfirmed she worked with Youth A while the youth was placed at\nBellaview residential facility, until January 2024 when Youth A\nwent AWOL. Case Worker indicated Youth A was never placed\nthrough Bethany Refugee program.\nContact occurred with MDHHS Worker on 4/9/25, 4/10/25,\n4/16/25, 4/29/25, and 4/30/25. On 4/29/25 MDHHS Worker\nconfirmed Youth A went AWOL from Bellaview, a licensed\nresidential facility (CI410361186). Youth A was never placed in\nBethany’s Refugee CPA program, which this complaint was\nopened under. MDHHS Worker reported there would be no\nfindings from their investigation.\nDCWL CCI Consultant was contacted on 4/29/25, as she was\nassigned to Bellaview residential program. CCI Consultant had\ndocumentation from an annual review completed in March 2024,\nwhich verified Youth A was placed in that program and went\nAWOL, resulting in case closure. CCI Consultant reported the\nagency was cited during their review, as they did not have\ndischarge summaries completed.\nDocumentation\n• DCWL inspection report dated 3/5/24- Bellaview\n(CI410361186) was cited regarding missing discharge\nsummaries for closed cases.\n• DCWL inspection documentation- In the information\nprovided to CCI Consultant in preparation of the 3/5/24\nreview, Bellaview listed Youth A as a closed case effective\n1/29/24.\n• Court order dated 10/4/23- “It is ordered that the child\n(Youth A) is referred to the Kent County Department of\nHuman Services for placement and care under MCL\n400.55(H)”.\n3",
    "Analysis No violation was found. During the course of the investigation, it\nwas determined Youth A was never placed with this agency.\nTherefore, the agency had no responsibility to find placement for\nYouth A.\nA court order dated 10/4/23 stated Youth A was under the\nplacement and care of Kent County DHHS. Youth A was placed in\na licensed residential program, Bellaview, under the statewide\nBethany Christian Services umbrella. The residential program\nclosed Youth A’s case on 1/29/2024 after AWOL, as required by\ntheir ORR contract. Therefore, the program was not required to\nfind placement for Youth A when she reached out in April 2025. In\naddition, while the residential facility was unable to locate a\ndischarge plan for the youth, DCWL CCI Consultant reported the\nprogram was already cited for this missing documentation in the\n3/5/2024 reevaluation. A corrective action plan was approved and\nimplemented. Therefore, a new investigation was not initiated\nregarding the residential facility license.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n_ ______________April 30, 2025_______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 1, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
