    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\nSection (1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-to-child\nDescription ratio formula for direct care workers. If a child caring institution is\ncontracted by the department to care for youth, the facility will\nfollow its contracted ratio.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation An incident report by Staff 1 suggested the facility or wing was out\nof ratio on 7/13/23 between 8:30 - 10:15pm.\nInvestigation On 7/26/23, Complainant, who is also DCWL Program Manager,\nprovided a partially redacted incident report. The report dated\n7/13/23 authored by Vista Maria Staff 1 identified Youth A and two\nother unidentified youths. The last sentence of the report\nindicated “Staff 1 noticed that Unidentified Youth Z was starting to\nget triggered and asked her to stay in the living area due to not\nhaving female staff to sit outside her door per her treatment plan.”\n“Not having female staff to sit outside her door per her treatment\nplan” was concerning to Complainant and suggested a possible\nlicensing rule violation of 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nI notified Youth A’s Foster Care Worker of this investigation\nassignment. She expressed no concerns about the facility.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI reviewed Vista Maria’s supervision policies and found nothing\nthat prohibits male staff from sitting outside a youth’s door.\nHowever, on 6/2/23, Human Resource Director emailed the\nfollowing to Vista Maria leadership clarifying specific prohibitions\nfor male staff:\n• 1 male staff cannot be in any area with 1 youth by himself.\n• 1 male staff cannot transport a youth on or off campus by\nhimself.\n• Male staff cannot do Observations into bedrooms after bedtime\nthrough midnight shift.\n• Male staff cannot sit with a youth that is in her bedroom on 100%\nobservation.\n• Male staff cannot monitor bathrooms during hygiene time.\n• Male staff cannot be assigned as 1:1 if that youth is the only\nyouth on the wing.\n2",
    "Vista Maria Mental Health has a staff to resident ratio of 1:2 during\nwaking hours. I requested the staff schedule for the afternoon\nshift on 7/13/23. On the date/time the incident report was written,\nthe facility was in ratio with two or more staff monitoring three\nyouths at all times.\nPrior to receiving this complaint, I completed an unannounced visit\non 7/5/23 at 3:30pm and found the facility was within the stated\nratio of staff to youth. On 7/27/23 at 1:00pm I showed up\nunannounced again and found each of the four wings were within\nratio.\nI interviewed the Therapist for Youth A and Unidentified Youth Z.\nShe has worked at the facility for over four years. Therapist said\nthere is no special staff supervision plan for Youth A. On 7/13/23,\nshe said Youth Z was on 1:1 staff supervision. 1:1 supervision\nrequires a staff person to be within arm-length distance of the\nyouth.\nI reviewed Youth Z’s intervention plan for staff dated 7/13/23. The\nplan indicated when the youth is in her room, the assigned 1:1\nstaff should provide eyes-on monitoring and support by sitting\noutside of her door with the door open.\nOn 7/28/23 I interviewed Staff 1 via telephone. He has worked at\nthe facility for four months. Staff 1 said the wing he worked on\n7/13/23 was within ratio. He said he followed Vista’s policy and\nthe youth’s treatment plan and apologized for the incident report\nbeing unclear. Staff 1 said there were two male staff and one\nfemale staff assigned to monitor three youths. The female staff\nstepped off the wing briefly to assist on another wing. “I felt it best\nto have Unidentified Youth Z monitored in the general area\nbecause there were no females on the wing (at that time).”\nShortly after, another female staff arrived to cover for the female\nwho had left. Staff 1 explained that Unidentified Youth Z’s\ntreatment plan indicates a female staff must sit outside of her door\nwhen Youth Z is in her room.\nAnalysis There is no evidence the facility lacked a sufficient number of staff\nor was out of ratio on 7/13/23.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nAugust 7, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 9, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
