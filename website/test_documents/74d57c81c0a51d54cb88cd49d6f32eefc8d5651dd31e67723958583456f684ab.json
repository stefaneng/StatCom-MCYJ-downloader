Youth A was upset that staff were talking with Youth\nD in her room and began yelling to let Youth D out. Youth A\ncharged at Staff 4.

Staff 8 attempted to talk with the girls\nand encourage them to calm down. But they did not want to listen\nto her. The girls wanted to have a sleep over in the living room but\nwere told that was not allowed. So, they continued running\naround, yelling, swearing, laughing and dancing. Staff 4 arrived on\nthe wing and told staff to move the pile of pillows and blankets out\nof the living room. Staff 8 assisted with this task.

However, it was noted that\nofficers restrained youth to the ground.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• The Human Resources file for Staff 1 was reviewed. Staff 1\nwas hired 6/26/24, attended Orientation 6/27/24, and\ncompleted CPI training 7/10/24.

Youth A had full range of\nmotion, no swelling, and no bruising. Youth A had a small\nbruise on her forearm. When asked if it was old or new,\nYouth A became upset, yelling, and refused to complete\nthe assessment.\n• A nursing note dated 8/12/24 (3:30PM) indicated Youth A\ncomplained of pain in her left wrist since the “incident” with\npolice. Youth A stated she was held face down on the\nground. Youth A reported she was not sure if she sprained\nher wrist but had multiple wrist sprains on both sides in her\npast. As the exam continues, Youth A complained of pain in\nher right wrist, stating it bothered her more than the left\nwrist. Youth A then stated she was not sure which wrist\nhurt, indicating she could not remember because she was\ntired. Youth A requested a bandage for her wrist, indicating\nit was the only thing that will fix her pain. Youth A was\noffered ibuprofen for pain as needed. The diagnosis was\ndocumented as a “superficial injury of right wrist”.\n• Behavior Management policy indicates that staff must have\nongoing, education, training, and demonstrated knowledge\nof non-physical intervention and physical intervention,\nCrisis Prevention Institute (CPI).\nAnalysis No violation was found as video review and interviews of youth\nand staff did not support the allegation that Staff 1 choked Youth\nA.\nAlthough Youth A had some marks on her biceps and wrists, it\nwas determined that staff were not aggressive with her. The cause\nof the marks was indeterminate and may have been due to Youth\nA’s physically aggressive behavior, Youth A struggling to break\nfree from staff during a standing hold, the restraint by law\nenforcement, or transportation to the hospital by law enforcement.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Behavior management\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4157\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures that describe the institution’s behavior management\n12",
    "system. The policies and procedures shall be reviewed annually\nand updated as needed. These shall be available to all youth, their\nfamilies, and referring agencies.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff improperly restrained youth, causing scratches and bruises.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nDuring the course of the investigation, Staff 1 admitted to holding\nYouth A’s wrists, to prevent her from throwing items. Staff 1 also\nreported holding Youth A by the back of the neck to prevent her\nfrom biting. Staff 1 stated that she was aware these were not CPI\napproved restraint techniques. Staff 1 also reported she was\nimmediately corrected by other staff and asked to step away.\nThis information was confirmed during interviews with Staff 6 and\nStaff 8.\nVideo reviewed:\n• Video from 8/10/24 was reviewed. The video was\nconsistent with information reported by staff. However, it\nwas difficult to fully see the interaction between Youth A\nand Staff 1 due to the video quality.\nThe video did not show a restraint of Youth B, or staff\npushing her into a room.\nThe video showed Youth D in her room with staff, with the\ndoor ajar.\n• A second video of the wing was reviewed. This video was\nfilmed during the time Law Enforcement was there. The\nvideo was very dark which made it difficult to see\nspecifically what occurred. However, it was noted that\nofficers restrained youth to the ground.\nDocuments reviewed\n• CPI training materials were reviewed. Holding the youth’s\nwrists and holding the back of youth’s neck are not\nidentified as interventions in CPI and therefore not\napproved techniques.\n• Behavior Management policy indicates that staff must have\nongoing, education, training, and demonstrated knowledge\nof non-physical intervention and physical intervention,\nCrisis Prevention Institute (CPI).\nAnalysis The facility is found to be in violation based on interviews, video\nreview, and an admission by Staff 1 that she did not follow CPI\ntraining.\n13",
