INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A staff member asked a youth to shower with her and then the\nstaff member proceeded to take pictures of another youth in the\nshower. Both youth have developmental disabilities and function\nat different levels.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Therapist was interviewed face to face at the\nChildren’s Advocacy Center on 2/14/23. Complainant stated\nYouth A was complaining about her dislike of Staff 1, which was a\ncommon occurrence. Youth A made a variety of comments\nincluding stating her intent to “jump” Staff 1. When Youth A was\nencouraged to find more effective ways to express her needs, she\n2",
    "decided to fill out a client’s rights form. On the form, she wrote the\nallegations about Staff 1 taking pictures of Youth B in the shower\nand offering Youth A money to shower. Prior to writing this note,\nYouth A had never expressed any concerns about Staff 1 acting\nsexually inappropriate with her or Youth B. Complainant reported\nhe has not personally witnessed any inappropriate behaviors or\nconcerns between Staff 1 and Youth A or Youth B. Complainant\nreported Youth B has a hygiene intervention plan developed by\nthe Behavior Intervention Team, but Youth A does not.\nObserved CAC Interview for Youth A conducted by CAC\nInterviewer on 2/14/23. Youth A reported Staff 1 is a creep\nbecause she asks people to take showers. Youth A stated Staff 1\nasked her to take a shower with her once. Youth A stated when\nshe was washing her body in the shower, she saw Staff 1\nreaching her arm in the bathroom taking pictures of Youth A with\nher phone. Youth A reported she knew Staff 1 was taking pictures\nbecause she was pressing on the screen of her phone. Youth A\nreported the door to the bathroom was open because she wanted\nto listen to music. She reported she did not have a Bluetooth\nspeaker or MP3 player, so Staff 1 was playing music for Youth A\non her phone. Youth A reported Staff 1 took pictures of Youth B\ntoo. Youth A did not see it happen but heard Staff 1 giggling and\nStaff 1 always giggles when she is doing something wrong. Youth\nA stated one time she was vacuuming the hallway by where the\nbathroom was and saw Staff 1 touching Youth B’s private parts in\nthe bathroom. Youth A specified Staff 1 was touching Youth B’s\nbreasts with her hands and Youth B did not have clothes on, but\nStaff 1 did. Youth A stated she does not know if anything else\nhappened because she “didn’t want any part of what was\nhappening” and walked away. Youth A reported shortly after she\nbegan staying at the facility, she went with two other youth, Staff 1\nand Staff 2 to Walmart for an outing. Youth A reported when they\nwere leaving Walmart, she was sitting in the back seat with one\nyouth and Staff 1 and Staff 1 was masturbating in the back seat.\nWhen asked to demonstrate, Youth A used her hands to scratch\nthe inside of her thighs. Youth A reported one time Staff 1 showed\nYouth A a picture of Staff 1’s breasts she had on her phone. Youth\nA reported Staff 1 made her feel uncomfortable and was always\nweird.\nObserved CAC Interview for Youth B conducted by a CAC\nInterviewer on 2/14/23. Youth B was unable to be interviewed\ndue to her lack of verbal skills and limited cognitive functioning.\n3",
    "Supervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/15/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law\nEnforcement. Supervisor reported each youth requires a different\nlevel of intervention on the unit. He stated Youth B requires a little\nmore assistance in the shower, but the level of assistance she\nneeds has decreased as she’s been in the program. He stated\nshe is now to the point where staff only have to apply shampoo to\nher hair, and put soap in a washcloth, but she can wash all of the\nsoap out of her hair and off her body. Supervisor reported at times\nstaff will use their phones to play music for youth when they\nshower if the youth does not have a Bluetooth speaker or MP3\nplayer. Staff are encouraged to provide the youth with as much\ndignity and respect as possible when showering and staff are\ninstructed to do as little as possible to assist. Supervisor reported\nStaff 1 was very excited to work with the youth and came on a\nlittle too strong while trying to build relationships with them.\nSupervisor reported the youth in the program can be standoffish\ndue to the trauma they’ve endured, and Staff 1 struggled with that,\nso she tended to push harder. She was coached to instead do\n“parallel play” with the youth to avoid coming on to strong in her\ninteractions. Supervisor reported none of the youth have\nspecifically complained about Staff 1 until this incident.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 2/28/23. Staff 1 reported\nshe has never played music for Youth A on her phone because\nYouth A has always had her own MP3 player. Staff 1 reported one\ntime when Youth A was about to take a shower, Youth A asked\nanother staff member to get her a charger for her MP3 player. The\nstaff member then asked Staff 1 to grab the charger because the\nother staff began helping another resident. Staff 1 reported she\nopened the bathroom door, yelled Youth A’s name, and handed\nher the charger. She reported she stuck her hand into the\nbathroom, but never looked inside the bathroom or walked into the\nbathroom. Staff 1 reported Youth B needs prompting for her\nshowers because she really enjoys showers and would stay under\nthe water for hours if she could. Staff 1 reported the only tasks she\nhas had to help Youth A with are putting shampoo in her hands\nand putting body wash on the loofah. Staff 1 reported Youth B can\ncomplete everything else independently. Staff 1 reported there\nhave been a few times when she has helped Youth B dry her back\noff with the towel because she has difficulty doing so and then has\ntrouble putting her clothes on when her back is wet, but that has\nonly happened a few times. Staff 1 reported she was not\nmasturbating in the back of the car when leaving the outing from\nWalmart. She reported it was an extremely cold night and she\nremembered she put her hands in between her thighs to help\n4",
    "warm her hands from the frigid temperatures, but nothing else.\nStaff 1 reported she has never forced the youth to pick her to help\nthem with showers. She reported the only things she said at staff\nmeeting was she felt allowing the youth to pick the staff member\nto help them every time creates favoritism amongst staff and can\nalso be disruptive to staff routines during shifts if the staff member\nthe youth picks is involved in another responsibility at the time.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/15/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law Enforcement.\nStaff 2 reported she drove to and from the outing to Walmart and\nnone of the youth appeared upset or stated they were\nuncomfortable with any actions by anyone during the trip. Staff 2\nreported she felt sometimes Staff 1 would push herself onto the\nyouth around shower time by saying “how about I help you with\nyour shower tonight” or “I’m going to help you with your shower\ntonight” rather than asking for the youth’s preference. Staff 2\nconfirmed Youth A has had an MP3 player since coming to the\nfacility and plays music on that when she showers. Staff 2\nreported one time, soon after Youth A arrived at the facility, Staff 1\nwas sitting in a chair across from the door of the bathroom where\nYouth A was showering. Staff 2 reported she thought it was odd\nStaff 1 was sitting outside the door because Youth A did not need\nany assistance with showering. Staff 2 reported she wasn’t sure\nwhy it occurred, but never asked. Staff 2 reported she never saw\nStaff 1 do anything inappropriate with or towards Youth A or Youth\nB.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/15/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law Enforcement.\nStaff 3 assisted Youth A with writing the client’s rights form\ncomplaining about Staff 1 per Youth A’s request. Staff 3 reported\nshe has never worked with Staff 1. Staff 3 reported a previous\nyouth told her she was uncomfortable with Staff 1, but never\nprovided any specific information or details as to why she felt that\nway.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/15/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law Enforcement.\nStaff 4 reported Youth A previously complained about Staff 1\nbeing actively meaner towards her than the other youth. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 was holding more of a boundary with her and\nfollowing through on set expectations, which Youth A did not like.\nStaff 4 is a behavior analyst at the facility and frequently\ncompletes behavior analysis observations on staff interactions\nwith youth. Staff 4 reported Staff 1 attempted to build rapport with\n5",
    "Youth A, but Youth A had no interest in developing a relationship\nwith her and specifically said she did not want Staff 1 to befriend\nher. Staff 4 reported when Youth A first arrived at the facility, there\nwas a general self-harm plan in place, which stated staff needed\nto keep an eye on Youth A in all environments. Although sitting\noutside the bathroom wasn’t specifically written in the safety plan,\na staff member sitting outside of the bathroom to keep an eye on\nYouth A would have been a reasonable plan or expectation for\nthat environment. Staff 4 reported she does not have any\nconcerns with Staff 1’s interactions with youth and has never\nreceived any complaints about Staff 1 from any of the youth. Staff\n4 never witnessed any interactions between Staff 1 and any of the\nyouth that would be considered inappropriate.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Significant Incident report dated 2/1/23 authored by\nComplainant/Therapist.

    "• Youth B’s Showering Program states staff should ask\nYouth B who she would like to help her with her shower.\nStaff should be positioned at a distance to provide prompts\nwhen needed. The program outlines the hierarchy of\nprompts that should be given which ranges from Verbal\nInstruction/Reminder to Full Physical Guidance (always\nusing the least intrusive prompt necessary).\n• Supervision logs ranging in dates from 10/21/22-1/31/23 (7\nin total) between Supervisor and Staff 1. Trends of Staff 1’s\nindividual goals and professional development surround\nbuilding rapport with the youth without pushing social\ninteractions on them, keeping firm expectations without\nbeing harsh/negative tone of voice, and keeping physical\nboundaries with youth (let them come to her and interact\nrather than her coming to them).\n• Shift Fill-In Logs for Shifts Staff 1 worked. Log dated\n1/21/23 notes Youth A and another youth went on an outing\nto the store with staff. Log also notes Youth A was in a\ngood space all shift and had no issues to report.

She was suspended from work pending\nthe findings of this investigation.\n• Wedgwood Christian Services Professional Staff\nRelationships Policy (rev. 8/23/22) outlines appropriate\nboundaries between staff and youth in the program.\n• Wedgwood Christian Services Physical Contact and\nSexuality Policy (rev. 8/23/22) outlines appropriate\ninteractions and physical boundaries between staff and\nyouth; specifically considering the youth’s trauma history.\nAnalysis Documentation reviewed and interviews conducted suggest Staff\n1 was overzealous in her interactions with youth, but there were\nno concerns these interactions were sexually inappropriate in\nnature. Specific observations from the Supervisor and Staff 4 were\nStaff 1 was working on building rapport with the youth and\n7",
    "sometimes came on too strong. Although Youth A says Staff 1\nacted inappropriately with her and Youth B, it is unknown what\ndate this may have occurred, or which staff may have been\npresent. Staff interviewed never witnessed any sexually\ninappropriate interactions between Staff 1 and any youth. There is\nno evidence to support Staff 1 acted inappropriately with Youth A\nor Youth B.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.

It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMay 3, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 4, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
