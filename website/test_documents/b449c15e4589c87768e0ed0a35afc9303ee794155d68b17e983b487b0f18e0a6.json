    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10177 Resident Restraint\nSection (1) The facility shall establish and follow written policy and\nDescription procedures specifying the use of resident restraint.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 3/11/24, youth covered a camera in their room and was being\nnon-compliant when asked to remove it. A staff attempted to\nuncover the camera and youth grabbed the staff's arm. Staff\nexecuted a physical restraint which took youth down to the\nmattress they were both standing on. Youth reported staff used\nexcessive force and assaulted him by putting their arm on his\nthroat. The camera did not capture any of the incident due to it\nbeing covered.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face\nto face at the facility on 3/14/24 in conjunction with MDHHS\nWorker. CA reported Youth A told her he was going to get the\nfacility shut down and was going to sue them before this incident\noccurred. CA reported Staff 1 said Youth A grabbed him, so Staff\n1 completed a physical restraint on Youth A. CA reported Youth A\ncovered the camera in his room prior to the incident, so nothing\ncan be seen on the video. CA reported she asked why Staff 1\ndidn’t yell louder for help and CA told her he wasn’t yelling\nanymore due to the last investigation he was in during September\n2023 (SIR2023C0000744). CA reported whether Youth A grabbed\nStaff 1 or grabbed the broom Staff 1 was holding, they cannot\nallow youth to have a weapon, and the broom would have been\nconsidered one. CA reported after the incident, Staff 1 went to the\ndoctor because his back was hurt. CA noted Youth A always\ncomplies with Staff 1, so this interaction was completely abnormal.\nCA reported based on this situation the facility implemented a new\npolicy regarding cameras being covered in youth bedrooms, which\nstates staff should not go into a youth’s bedroom alone.\nAdministrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n3/14/24 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Administrator\nstated Staff 1 was a floater on 3/11/24 and responded to a call\nasking for him to help with Youth A’s behavior. Administrator\nspoke with Youth A after the incident and wrote his statement of\nwhat happened. Administrator reported Youth A repeated “Your\nstaff assaulted me. Get a hold of my attorney. I’m going to sue.”\nmultiple times. Administrator reported Youth A has a history of\nusing wet toilet paper or tissue to cover the camera and\nbarricading the door, so he can assault staff when they enter the\n2",
    "room. Administrator noted this behavior has happened at previous\nplacements as well.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/14/24\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported he was\ncalled by Supervisor 2 to assist with Youth A because Youth A\nwas banging the security flap on his door, which came loose, and\nYouth A covered the camera in his bedroom. Staff 1 reported\nwhen he went to Youth A’s bedroom, he closed the security flap\nand locked it. Then he asked Youth A to remove the tissue from\nthe camera in his room. Youth A replied he wasn’t going to\nuncover it until he could speak with his worker from Health West.\nStaff 1 reported he left the pod and came back with a broom to\nuncover the camera, since Youth A refused. Youth A stood on top\nof the bed to block the camera so Staff 1 couldn’t uncover it. Staff\n1 reported he asked Youth A to get down two times, but Youth A\nrefused. Staff 1 reported he stood on the bed and tried to go\naround Youth A to uncover the camera with the broom handle.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A grabbed Staff 1’s wrist with one hand and\nthe broom handle with the other. Staff 1 reported he had to let go\nof the broom so he could get out of the way because he was\nconcerned Youth A was going to assault him. Staff 1 reported he\nphysically restrained Youth A and demonstrated a Primary\nRestraint Technique (PRT) hold during the interview (Youth A’s\narms behind his back with Staff’s arms around Youth A’s arms,\nand Staff’s hands on Youth’s back). Staff 1 noted performing the\nrestraint was a struggle because they were standing on top of the\nbed, so it was unsteady. Staff 1 reported they fell onto the bed and\nYouth A was moving around and fighting. Staff 1 reported he\ncalled out for help and Supervisor 1 entered the room within a\ncouple seconds. Staff 1 reported he was still on the bed with\nYouth A and Supervisor 1 called a code 1 for assistance. Staff 1\nreported he released Youth A from the restraint once Youth A\ncalmed down and stopped struggling. Staff 1 reported he asked\nYouth A to calm down multiple times during the incident. Staff 1\nreported after he released Youth A and got up, Youth A alleged\nStaff 1 assaulted him. Staff 1 reported he and CA left the room\nand went to see if there was any video footage, but there wasn’t\nbecause the camera was covered. Staff 1 reported he went to the\ndoctor after the incident and was diagnosed with a strained back.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 4/8/24. Staff 2 reported\nshe was on another pod with other youth when she heard Staff 1’s\nvoice on Youth A’s pod. Staff 2 reported she opened the door to\nYouth A’s pod and saw Staff 1 had a broom in his hand. Staff 1\ntold Staff 2 he was going to uncover Youth A’s camera. About 5-6\n3",
    "minutes later, Staff 2 reported she heard commotion and heard\nStaff 1 yelling “move back”. Staff 2 reported she opened the door\nto Youth A’s pod again and saw Staff 1 and Youth A on the bed\nscuffling. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was on top of the bed and Youth\nA was lying face up on the bed with his head towards the end of\nthe bed. Staff 2 reported Youth A’s head was not hanging off the\nbed. Staff 2 reported she wasn’t sure if they fell, if Staff 1 was\ntrying to do a restraint or something else was happening because\nshe didn’t see how it started. Staff 2 reported she secured the\nyouth in her pod and came back onto Youth A’s pod to help. When\nshe arrived in Youth A’s room, Youth A was standing up, yelling,\nand saying Staff 1 assaulted him. Youth A reported Staff 1 told\nhim to move back so he could remove the paper from the camera.\nYouth A stated when Staff 1 leaned forward to try and get the\npaper off, Youth A grabbed the broom. Youth A stated he was\ngoing to sue the facility because Staff 1 assaulted him.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via phone on 4/2/24. Supervisor\n1 reported he did not see the entire incident. Supervisor 1\nreported he exited another youth’s room and heard a commotion,\nso he went to Youth A’s room. When he entered the room, Staff 1\nand Youth A were already on the bed with Youth A laying down\nand Staff 1 sort of laying at a 45-degree angle on the bed next to\nhim. Supervisor 1 reported they were centered on the bed, but\nYouth A kept fighting and moving all over the bed. Supervisor 1\nreported it looked like Staff 1 was trying to get Youth A in the right\nposition to restrain him, and Youth A was trying to roll his body\nover and around to avoid getting restrained. Supervisor 1 told\nYouth A to calm down and called a code 1 for assistance.\nSupervisor 1 could not remember if Staff 1 was successful in\ngetting Youth A in a restraint on the bed. Supervisor 1 reported he\ndidn’t see Staff 1 do anything concerning, didn’t see Staff 1\nassault Youth A, and didn’t see Staff 1 use any excessive force.\nSupervisor 1 reported he never saw Youth A’s head hanging off\nthe bed and never saw Staff 1’s forearm on Youth A’s neck.\nSupervisor 1 reported the only thing he was concerned about was\nStaff 1 didn’t yell louder for help. Supervisor 1 reported he talked\nto Staff 1 about it, and Staff 1 reported he doesn’t yell anymore.\nSupervisor 1 reported he informed Staff 1 there are times like this\nsituation where yelling is necessary.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via phone on 4/17/24. Supervisor\n2 reported when she responded to the code 1 and arrived at\nYouth A’s room, Youth A was laying on the bed on his back with\nhis head towards the end of the bed. Supervisor 2 reported Youth\nA’s head was on top of the mattress on the bed and was not\n4",
    "hanging off the bed. Supervisor 2 reported Staff 1 was on the bed\nbut was not on top of Youth A. Supervisor 2 reported Staff 1 was\nholding Youth A’s arms, and it looked like he was trying to get\nYouth A back into position to do a PRT hold since they fell onto\nthe bed. Supervisor 2 reported it appeared there was no way for\nStaff 1 to flip Youth A over to get into the PRT hold, so she told\nStaff 1 to let Youth A go. Supervisor 2 reported Staff 1 got off the\nbed and left the room.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/14/24\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A initially reported\nhe did not want to be interviewed because the situation “wasn’t a\nbig deal”. However, Youth A reluctantly agreed to be interviewed.\nYouth A reported he covered his camera because he wanted to\nspeak with his worker and thought it would force staff to allow him\nto talk to her. Youth A reported Staff 1 came into his room with a\nbroom, so Youth A stood on his bed. Youth A reported Staff 1\nstood on the bed as well. Youth A reported he moved out of Staff\n1’s way, but then reached up and grabbed the top of the broom.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 grabbed him by his shoulders while they\nwere facing each other, then turned him around, and held his\narms behind his back. When Youth A demonstrated the\npositioning, it looked like the physical restraint hold Staff 1\ndemonstrated during his interview. Youth A then changed his story\nand stated his arms were never behind him, and Staff 1 held his\narms crossed in front of him. When Youth A was asked how they\nended up on the bed, Youth A stated Staff 1 tripped him to get him\ndown on the bed. However, then Youth A stated they were both\nstanding on the bed and were moving around so much, it caused\nthem to fall. Youth A reported after they fell onto the bed, Staff 1’s\nforearm was on Youth A’s head with Youth A’s head hanging off\nthe bed and his face to the side.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 3/11/24 in Youth A’s room as well as the\nmilieu area outside of Youth A’s room was reviewed.
