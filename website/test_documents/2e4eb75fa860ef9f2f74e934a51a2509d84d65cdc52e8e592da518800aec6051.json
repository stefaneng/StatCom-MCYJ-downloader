One SER reviewed included\nallegations the youth was being called names by the foster parent. The foster\nparent interviews focused on the discipline methods used which did not\ninclude name calling; however, the report did not include that the foster\nparents were asked about the specific allegations.",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• No consultation was requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was 1 substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. The one SER involving substantiated maltreatment in care addressed medical\nneglect of youths placed in the foster home. The report identified appropriate\ninterviews and document reviews to verify the results. The agency's recommendation\nof revocation was appropriate based on the findings of fact.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The one\nCAP submitted by the agency was in response to the 2024 licensing inspection\nreport dated 8/8/2024 and was approved on 8/18/2024. That CAP addressed ten\nviolations, three of which were policy violations no longer regulated by DCWL and\nseven of which were licensing rule violation. Each of those violations were\npresent in either one or two files. The CAP was largely successful as evidenced by\nonly three of the violations addressed in that CAP being repeated this year.\nDuring the period under review the Child Placing Agency license was closed for\nthe Cass County office and that office became a satellite to the St. Joseph office.\nThis has some impact on the comparison between the 2024 and 2025 inspections\nas the 2024 inspection and CAP for the Cass County files are not represented.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was completed on 5/19/2025 and indicated\nthe agency staff continue to implement strategies such as email and calendar\nreminders to ensure compliance with timeframes. Placement staff are providing\nrequired placement information/documents before placement/replacement and\nchecklists are being utilized to assist with ensuring all information/documents were\nprovided as required. The only barriers identified by the chief administrator is the\nlack of residential placements and psychiatric beds for youth assessed to need\nthose services. The chief administrator reports a positive impact from the CAP\ndeveloped after the last licensing inspection.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A",
    "Staff Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed reported receiving good support from supervision\nand co-workers. They indicate being able to access the program manager and\nDirector, as needed. They all stated there are good systems in place to help\nmanage due dates and tasks. No concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office has adequate space and equipment for the delivery of foster\ncare, independent living, and certification services. Physical CHRI for both the St.\nJoseph and Cass county families is stored securely within locked cabinets in the\nlicensing supervisor's office. There is a cross shredder in the office. Closed\nadoption files are locked in cabinets which are located in the main office which is\nonly accessible by key card. The Cass County office, which is a satellite to the St.\nJoseph location is currently undergoing construction.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n6/13/2025\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 16, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
