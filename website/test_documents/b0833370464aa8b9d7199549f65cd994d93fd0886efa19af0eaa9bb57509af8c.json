    "Allegation Allegations of an improper restraint causing youth to be in prone\nposition and receive injuries.\nInvestigation Youth A/Complainant was interviewed by this Consultant during an\nunannounced face-to-face visit on 12/27/2023. She confirmed that she\nhad been restrained a few days prior and stated that she went to the\nhospital the next day. Youth A stated that her ankle was bruised but not\nbroken and that it was getting better. She showed a right upper arm\nbruise and a right knee bruise as well. Youth A stated that she heard\nSupervisor 1 say to her “You broke my building, so I’m going to break\nyour heel.” Youth A also made allegations that Supervisor 1 was\nwhispering about her to another youth in the days after the incident.\nYouth A was re-interviewed during an unannounced face-to-face visit\non 01/04/2023 with DHHS Worker 1 and Law Enforcement. She stated\nthat when the restraint occurred, she was in the cafeteria with other\nstaff. Youth A confirmed that she had been running around and “acting\na fool” while describing how dysregulated she was leading up to the\nrestraint. This also included breaking into the kitchen and attempting to\nlight things on fire, throwing pots and pans around, opening a first aid\nkit, running around with scissors, as well as spraying fire extinguishers\naround the building. Youth A stated that at one point during the\nincident she was near the front entrance with a fire extinguisher in her\nhand, and Youth A alleged that Supervisor 1 came from behind and\ngrabbed the extinguisher and threw it on the ground. Youth A then\nstated that Supervisor 1 grabbed her by the throat while facing her and\nslammed her on the front couch. Youth A recalled Supervisor 1 calling\nher a “pussy” and a “scary ass.” Youth A stated that the chaotic\nincident then continued when she eventually made her way into the\ncafeteria. Youth A recalled walking past Staff 1 who then followed her\ninside the cafeteria. Supervisor 1 then stated, “take her down.” Youth A\nstated that Supervisor 1 had her hands on Youth A‘s arms and, as she\nwent to the ground, Youth A fell to her side. Youth A then stated she\nwas laying on her stomach for a brief period before Supervisor 1\ngrabbed the back of her neck and flipped her whole body over with the\none hand. Youth A stated that she was attempting to hit Supervisor 1\nand kick and fight during the incident. She confirmed that Supervisor 1\neventually had her left hand, Staff 1 on her right hand and Staff 5 was\ntrying to hold down her legs during the floor restraint. Youth A\nconfirmed that she was on her back for this portion of the restraint.\nYouth A then stated that she was hyperventilating and gagging causing\nher to spit. Youth A stated that her shirt was pulled up from her\nmidsection to cover her face to block the spit. Youth A recalled that she\neventually pulled her arms out and pushed the three staff out of the\nway. She stated that at that point, no one was touching her, and Staff 4\ncame in and spoke to her. Youth A stated that her ankle began hurting\nat that moment, and she believed it was broken. She recalled\n4",
    "Supervisor 1 allegedly saying “get up and walk to your damn unit.”\nYouth A confirmed that she received over-the-counter medication that\nevening and went to urgent care the next day, where it was confirmed\nthat her ankle was not broken.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed on 01/04/2023 with DHHS Worker 1 and\nLaw Enforcement. She confirmed that she is a residential care\nsupervisor and has worked at the facility for 16 years. Supervisor 1\nstated that she has no discipline in her employee file, which was\nconfirmed. Supervisor 1 stated that she was not actually at work as the\nincident in question started to occur. She got a call from Staff 1 while\noffsite that Youth A was spraying fire extinguishers, so she came back\nto the facility. As Supervisor 1 got to the facility she came in the front\nentrance and witnessed the fire extinguisher exhaust everywhere.\nSupervisor 1 recalled fire alarms going off. She also recalled making\nsure that Youth B was taken care of because Youth B suffers from\nasthma and was physically bothered by all the exhaust. Supervisor 1\nstated that she saw Youth A near the front entrance and took the fire\nextinguisher from her. Supervisor 1 denied that she did this in an\naggressive manner. She did state that she gave several loud directives\nto go sit down, and Youth A complied. Supervisor 1 denied putting her\nhands on Youth A in any way during this part of the incident. She stated\nthat she then went to the cafeteria to assess additional damage. She\nrecalled that Youth A followed her back into the cafeteria. Supervisor 1\ncannot remember exactly what Youth A was saying, but she believed\nshe was highly escalated and doing a lot of yelling and screaming.\nSupervisor 1 recalled stating something to the effect of “just sit down,\nyou already tore the building up.” Supervisor 1 stated that Youth A\neventually started to approach her and took multiple swings at her, and\nshe believed those were attempts to punch her. Supervisor 1 instructed\nStaff 1 to come with her and put Youth A in a standing restraint.\nSupervisor 1 recalled that Youth A was physically struggling, and\neventually the restraint went down to the floor. Supervisor 1 stated that\nthis was not completely intentional in the moment. Supervisor 1 denied\nthat Youth A was ever in a prone position, but that Youth A fell to her\nside and then rolled to her back immediately and began to kick at staff.\nShe then stated that upon Youth A laying on her back on the floor she\ninstructed Staff 1 to get Staff 5 to be involved. Supervisor 1 described\nan identical physical set up for the restraint as Youth A. Supervisor 1\nrecalled Youth A doing a lot of kicking. Supervisor 1 stated that Staff 4\ncame in to relieve Staff 5 and help with the restraint. Supervisor 1\nstated that Youth A was attempting to spit on all of the staff that were\nnear them. She stated that the staff used the bottom of Youth A’s shirt\nas a shield, but denied that the shirt was ever within inches of Youth A‘s\nface and denied that it would have obstructed her breathing in any way.\nSupervisor 1 stated that she knew Youth A did not have any trouble\n4",
    "breathing, because she continued to yell throughout the entirety of the\nincident. Supervisor 1 recalled Youth A stating that her heel hurt\ntowards the end of the restraint. Eventually, Youth A was able to\nconfirm that she felt like she was going to be safe, and the restraint\nended. Supervisor 1 recalled Youth A sitting with Staff 4 and asking to\ntalk to the police. Supervisor 1 confirmed that an officer came to the\nfacility that night. Supervisor 1 stated that it was possible that Youth A\nhad heard her or other staff discussing the possibility of charges being\npressed against her because of the damage done to the facility.\nSupervisor 1 denied allegations that she used any inappropriate\nlanguage during the incident itself, or in the days since then. In addition,\nshe denied that there were any situations where she was discussing\nYouth A‘s situation with any other youth, whether that be in front of\nYouth A, or outside of her presence. At the conclusion of the interview\nstaff showed DHHS Worker 1 the areas in the building where the\nincident occurred.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 and Law Enforcement\nduring an announced face-to-face visit on 01/04/2023. She stated that\nshe worked the night of the incident. During much of the incident she\nwas responsible for being the 1:1 staff with Youth B. However, Staff 1\nstated that as Youth A escalated, she passed off that responsibility to\nStaff 5. Staff 1 stated that Youth A began to escalate as a result of\nhaving to combine units during the holiday because many other youth\nwere out of the facility. Staff 1 described a very similar course of\nevents as Youth A became more and more escalated, including the\nincidents in the kitchen and front area involving the fire extinguishers.\nStaff 1 stated that by the time she made it to the front to follow Youth A\nshe witnessed Supervisor 1 already back in the facility and Youth A\nsitting on the couch. Supervisor 1 had the last fire extinguisher in her\npossession by that point. Staff 1 stated that she witnessed Supervisor 1\nbeing upset, but not more than normal, and did not hear her say\nanything inappropriate. Staff 1 recalled talking with Supervisor 1 at that\npoint about the possibility of a restraint later if Youth A were to escalate\nfurther and attempt to harm herself or anyone. Staff 1 stated that Youth\nA then ran back through the front lobby of the facility to the cafeteria\nand bumped into several staff, including Supervisor 1. Staff 1 stated\nthat Youth A then charged at Supervisor 1 and attempted to punch her.\nShe and Supervisor 1 then attempted to perform a standing restraint\nand as they tried to back up from one of the walls, the three of them fell\nto the ground. At that point Youth A was kicking and screaming at both\nof the staff. Staff 1 stated that Youth A fell to her side initially, but both\nof the staff adjusted her to her back immediately. Staff 1 described a\nsimilar course of events involving Staff 4 rotating in to replace Staff 5 as\nYouth A was continuing to fight. Staff 1 also described a similar\nresponse to Youth A spitting, where staff lifted up the bottom of Youth\n4",
    "A‘s shirt approximately a foot and a half away from her face to block the\nspit. She stated that the facility does have a mesh mask that they can\nuse during such an incident to attempt to ensure safety while also allow\nthe youth to breathe easily, but she stated that everything happened so\nfast, and they were not able to get a staff to attempt to look for it in time.\nStaff 1 recalled Youth A eventually committing to safety after\napproximately another five minutes of struggling and the restraint\nended. Youth A was provided medical attention at that point, and the\nurgent care that the facility works with requested that she be brought in\nthe next morning and gave advice for over-the-counter medication to\nhelp with any pain in her ankle.\nYouth B was interviewed during an announced face-to-face visit at the\nfacility on 01/08/2023 with DHHS Worker 1. Youth B stated that she\nwitnessed much of the incident because the staff responsible for her\n1:1 supervision had to be involved or were near much of what was\noccurring. Youth B stated that she was sprayed by some of the fire\nextinguishers, and it triggered an asthma attack. She stated that staff\nmade sure that she was taken care of and that she received proper\nmedical attention as a result. Youth B stated that she witnessed staff\ninteracting with Youth A as she was escalated. Youth B denied hearing\nanything inappropriate and denied witnessing any physical aggression\nfrom staff. Youth B stated that she did not see the restraint itself that\noccurred in the cafeteria as she was just outside it with her 1:1 staff and\nwas instructed not to enter the cafeteria at the time.\nYouth C was interviewed during an announced face-to-face visit at the\nfacility on 01/18/2023 with DHHS Worker 1. Youth C stated that she\nwitnessed part of the incident in question but not all of it. She stated\nthat the parts of Youth A‘s escalation and everything that happened that\nshe witnessed, she did not hear any staff state anything antagonizing or\ninappropriate to her. She also denied seeing any staff put their hands\non Youth A, although she did not witness the restraint itself\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an announced\nface-to-face visit on 01/18/2023. Staff 2 confirmed that she works as\nthe cook for the facility but also covers direct care shifts at times as\nwell. She confirmed that she was filling in as a direct care staff the day\nof the incident. Staff 2 stated that she was not a part of nor a witness to\nthe restraint, but she did hear Youth A speaking about it afterwards.\nYouth A stated that Supervisor 1 had called her a “bitch” and had broke\nher ankle. Staff 2 stated that she did not know if Youth A was telling the\ntruth or not, but that she immediately reported those allegations up to a\nsupervisor.\n4",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed on 01/18/2023 with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated that she did not\nwitness the restraint itself but that she spoke with Youth A immediately\nafterwards. Staff 3 recalled Youth A alleging that Supervisor 1 choked\nher from behind, which triggered her because her stepmother did the\nsame to her in the past. Staff 3 stated that Youth A also alleged that her\nshirt was pulled directly over her face and that she could not breathe\nduring the restraint, as well as how her leg still hurt. Staff 3 noted that\nshe saw Youth A walking just fine at that point in the night, which was in\nthe succeeding hours after the incident.\nStaff 4 was interviewed on 01/18/2023 with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 4 confirmed that she\nwas a part of the incident in question and that she swapped in for\nanother staff member at the end of the restraint. Staff 4 described\nYouth A as still escalated by the point she became involved, still kicking\nand spitting and yelling. Prior to her involvement she witnessed\nSupervisor 1, Staff 1 and Staff 5 being involved. Staff 5 asked to swap\nout because she did not feel she could help contain Youth A‘s legs, so\nStaff 4 swapped in. She stated she was the one who lifted up the\nbottom of Youth A’s shirt to prevent spitting. She stated that doing this\ndid not ever cover Youth A’s whole face nor did ever touch her face.\nShe stated that from her position she was not able to get the shirt close\nenough to the point where it may have restricted Youth A’s breathing.\nShe also stated that she knows that the facility has a mesh spit guard\nthat can be used in that situation but did not know where it was located\nat that moment. Staff 4 stated that the restraint ended after a few\nminutes when Youth A continued to complain about her legs hurting\nand then committed to safety and stopped spitting. She stated that in\nthe immediate aftermath of the restraint she saw Youth A limping on\none occasion, but also walking fine on another.\nStaff 5 was interviewed on 01/18/2023 with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit at the facility. She confirmed that she was\nworking in the facility the night of Youth A‘s restraint. Staff 5 recalled a\nsimilar reason for the escalation in behavior from Youth A, and that she\ndid not want to go to a separate unit during the holidays when there\nwere less youth in the facility. She stated that she was a part of the\nincident where Youth A broke into the kitchen and attempted to light\nthings on fire, throw pots and pans, and got her hands on a pair of\nscissors. Staff 5 stated that her strategy during every part of the\nincident that led up to the restraint was just to manage the environment\nfor Youth A. She stated this was in part due to not feeling completely\nconfident on when a restraint might be necessary. Staff 5 recalled\nYouth A spraying the fire extinguishers at staff as well as without aim.\nShe stated she followed Youth A to the lobby and that she witnessed\n4",
    "Youth A interacting with Supervisor 1 when Supervisor 1 first arrived\nback at the facility. Staff 5 stated that she never witnessed Supervisor 1\nescalate emotionally with Youth A or get physical and put hands on her\nat that point of the incident. Staff 5 took Youth B back to one of the\nunits to allow her to get some fresh air because of the fire extinguisher\nexhaust. She stated that she heard on her walkie-talkie that extra staff\nwas needed because Youth A attempted to fight Supervisor 1. Staff 5\nstated that she swapped out with another staff member to ensure that\nYouth B’s one-on-one supervision was continued and then went to the\ncafeteria. Staff 5 stated that she witnessed Youth A “walking up” on\nSupervisor 1 and swinging in an attempt to punch her. Staff 5 stated\nthat she witnessed Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 attempt a standing restraint\non Youth A, but that they quickly fell to the floor at which point Staff 5\nhelped with Youth A‘s legs. Staff 5 stated that Youth A was spitting and\nkicking. At one point Staff 5 called over for Staff 4 to replace her in an\nattempt to better restrain Youth A’s legs from kicking the staff. She also\ncalled on Staff 4 to get the spit guard mask but believed that there was\nnot enough time to grab it to use while Youth A was spitting. Staff 5\nrecalled hearing Youth A state that Supervisor 1 broke her ankle, but\nnoted that Supervisor 1 was not near Youth A‘s legs at any point during\nthe restraint. For a while Youth A would not respond when asked if she\nwas able to commit to safety to end the restraint, but eventually did so\nand the restraint ended. Staff 5 stated that she did not see Youth A limp\nat all. She believed that the restraint was warranted, quick, and was\nperformed appropriately. Staff 5 stated that she was around Youth A\nthe rest of the night and the next day and heard Youth A discussing the\nincident, but never heard her mention anything about choking or the\nallegations involving Supervisor 1 from prior to the restraint.\nDocuments reviewed:\n Report from Vassar Police Department dated 01/19/2023.\nCriminal claims from Youth A were unsubstantiated and the case\nis considered closed.\n Medical records from Covenant HealthCare dated 12/23/2023\ndocumenting medical care for Youth A. These records state that\nYouth A was experiencing right heel pain, but it was not as a\nresult of anything broken. Youth A was also prescribed an\ninhaler to assist with sore throat symptoms as a result of\ninhalation of fire extinguisher exhaust. No mention is made of\nYouth A stating she was choked or any injuries as a result of that\nallegation.\n 3 Incident Reports forms related to the incident dated\n12/22/2023, 12/22/2023 and 12/24/2023. These documents\ncoincide with staff recollections of the incident.\n4",
    " Client Incident Debriefing form from the facility dated\n12/22/2023. It is noted that Youth A refused to participate in the\nfacility’s restraint debriefing procedures.\n Pictures of the end result of the incident and damage done to the\nfacility were provided by Supervisor 1 that show extensive fire\nextinguisher exhaust and disarray in the kitchen.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews of staff and youth at the facility as well\nas documentation review it was found that there was not sufficient\nevidence to show that there was a rule violation as a result of the\nrestraint of Youth A. There was not evidence that Supervisor 1 choked\nor slammed Youth A into a couch. There is evidence to show that the\nrestraint itself was performed appropriately. Evidence does not support\nthat Youth A was ever in a prone position. It is also inconclusive that\nSupervisor 1 made any inappropriate comments during or after the\nrestraint.\nConsultation provided on 01/31/2023: Consultation was provided\nregarding staff training on restraints, more specifically ensuring that\ndirect care staff feel educated and confident on what situations may\nrequire the use of a restraint. Consultation was also provided regarding\nthe use of a mesh spit mask. The facility has mesh spit mask, but\nduring the time of the incident staff could not locate it in a timely fashion\nto utilize the tool to assist. The facility needs to access the cause and\naddress as needed to ensure tools are available to staff when needed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n02/03/2023\n___________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 7, 2023_______\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4",
