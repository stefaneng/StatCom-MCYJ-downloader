    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all licensing rules and statutes:\n2.) The facility is in compliance will all additional ISEP requirements.\n3.) The facility is in compliance will all additional MDDHS Contract/Policy requirements.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nDolores Hall (former capacity of 28) closed during this licensing period and\nis no longer part of the Vista Maria Open Residential license. The facility\nsubmitted one acceptable corrective action plan related to an unjustified\nand undocumented seclusion in Dolores Hall. The CAP was fully\nimplemented on 3/31/20. However, that building has since closed. The\nremaining buildings on this license (DeRoy & Myriam) do not have behavior\nmanagement rooms and do not seclude youth.\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nIn 2019, the Interim Inspection found one violation of R 400.4152 (i) Initial\ndocumentation – no documentation that the grievance policy was provided\nto residents and their families. A corrective action plan was submitted and\nfully implemented on 1/07/20.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nYour facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing rules, statutes, ISEP and\ncontracts. I recommend the facility be issued a renewal of their Regular license.\nNovember 5, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 10, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
