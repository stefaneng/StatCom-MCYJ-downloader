EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no substantiated incidents of corporol punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency submitted three CAPs during the period under review, as follows:\nThe first was in response to the 2024 licensing inspection report dated 4/19/2024,\nCAP Approved 5/14/2025. The CAP addressed 10 violations, 3 of which were\npolicy violations no longer regulated by DCWL. Of the remaining 7 violations, three\nwere not resolved by the CAP as they were cited this year.\nThe second was in response to special investigation 2024C0001101SI report date\n5/3/2024, CAP approved 6/5/202. The CAP addressed a violation of CPA rule\n400.12418(5) for one foster care worker not having involved caregivers in the\ndevelopment of service plans. That CAP was not successful as the violation was\nrepeated this year.\nThe third was in response to special investigation 2024SIC0001530 report date\n7/25/2024, CAP approved 8/29/2024. The CAP addressed a violation of CPA rule\n400.12421(2) for one foster care worker not having visited nine youths in May of\n2024. This violation was repeated during this inspection and will require additional\ncorrective action planning.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was completed on 4/14/2025. The chief\nadministrator indicated there has been an immense amount of change in staffing\nand leadership since the last inspection, including director, program manager,\nsupervisors, and direct care staff. The change in staffing has, at times, led to poor\ncase transition and a lack of compliance with the CAP that resulted from last\nyear's inspection. Some areas in which compliance has been noted to have been\nimproved include sibling and worker/parent visits. The chief administrator identified\n7",
    "three unplanned placement breaks that potentially could have been prevented by\nbetter communication and follow-through by workers related to caregiver\nneeds/requests.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency's financial statements and independent auditor's report dated June\n19, 2024, were reviewed. No financial concerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed discussed the changes in the leadership and direct care\nteam during the past year. They expressed challenges with taking over cases/staff\nfrom others who were not providing consistent support and direction. They also\ndiscussed the positive direction in which they feel the agency is heading.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has adequate space and equipment to provide the delivery of foster\ncare, independent living, and certification services. Physical CHRI is stored\nsecurely in a locked file cabinet within the same office as a cross shredder. All\nother files are stored securely in a lockable file storage room.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nApril 29, 2025\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 30, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
