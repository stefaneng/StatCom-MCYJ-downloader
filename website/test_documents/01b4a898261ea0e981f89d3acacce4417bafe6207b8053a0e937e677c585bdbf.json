Please note that there\nare additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility\nis in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract/Policy violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included\nin section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nNo Technical Assistance was required.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n- Staff that have been employed over a year are just hitting the 24-hour training\nrequirement. Consultation was provided to make sure training records for staff are\ncontinued to be monitored throughout the year.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility had six special investigations during this period under review with one\nresulting in a corrective action plan. The non-compliance included adequate staffing\non shift. The facility’s corrective action plan compliance is monitored quarterly. During\nthe quarterly unannounced visits, the facility has been found in compliance with\nhaving an adequate number of staff to youth ratio. During this interim audit, this\nconsultant interviewed the home supervisor who reported he has been working with\nhis team to make sure all open staffing shifts are filled. The supervisor reported if he\ndoes not have a staff member to fill a spot or if there is a last-minute call off, the\nsupervisor will cover the shift to make sure that the facility is ratio compliance. The\norganization has implemented a new weekly meeting where all unit supervisors meet\nto review staffing schedules and have plans in place for unexpected call ins for\ncoverage.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nChief Administrator noted over this reporting period there has been a decreased\ncensus in the program, primarily due to staffing challenges. The program has been\nable to continue to maintain in ratio and continued to provide therapy and contracted\nprograming throughout. Wedgwood has modified the pay structure of the program\nand given the largest wage increase to its workforce in years. Chief Administrator\n1",
    "notes this increase has been offset with internal costs and risks being absorbed by\nthe Wedgwood budget. This program has implemented additional clinical supports\nthorough two full time, non-ratio counting, Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA)\nstaff. These staff will assist in developing and implementing behavioral plans, training\nstaff, providing milieu treatment therapy using a behaviorist model and tracking\neffectiveness data. Chief Administrator noted staff are more motivated and beginning to\nimplement assigned behavioral plans on their own, restraint and aggressive interactions\nare decreasing, and data is showing an improvement in client response, effect, and staff\ninteractions.\nInterviews:\nStaff and youth interviews were conducted during the inspection and no issues or\nconcerns were raised. The youth all reported feeling safe and had positive relationships\nwith staff members. The staff all reported feeling supported by direct supervisors as well\nas administration. This consultant was able to interview the two new Board-Certified\nBehavior Analyst (BCBA) staff that have been implemented into the West Campus team\nwithin the past couple of months. These two staff are excited to use their learned\ntechniques to help support the direct care staff on the unit to care for the youth in\ntherapeutic ways in this specific population. The BCBA staff reported some of the veteran\nstaff are more resistant to this new change but have been implementing new skills on the\nfloor.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy. It is\nrecommended that the facility continue on their regular license.\nAugust 11, 2022\n________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 15, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n2",
