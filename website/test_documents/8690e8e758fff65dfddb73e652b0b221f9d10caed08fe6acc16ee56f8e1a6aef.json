    "• (k) Termination.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 6/25/25, a youth was brought to the hospital for seizure\nactivity. On 6/29/25, the youth was medically cleared for\ndischarge and the agency would not bring her back to the facility.\nThe agency submitted a removal request on 6/29/25, but they are\nrequired to give a 30-day notice.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nHospital Social Worker was interviewed by phone on 7/1/2025.\nShe reported Youth A was brought to Children’s Hospital on\n6/25/2025 by staff of Transitional Living Program due to seizure-\nlike activity. After a few days of medical testing, it was determined\nthere was no physical reason for the seizures, rather it was related\nto stress and the youth’s trauma history. Youth A was cleared for\ndischarge on 6/29/2025 with a recommendation for outpatient\nservices. Hospital Social Worker stated she had heard staff of\nTransitional Living Program were refusing to take Youth A back to\nher placement, so she spoke with Foster Care Supervisor who\nwas at Youth A’s bedside. Foster Care Supervisor told Hospital\nSocial Worker that Transitional Living Program would not be\ntaking Youth A back to her placement due to Youth A having\ndemonstrated self-harm behaviors prior to the hospitalization.\nHospital Social Worker stated MDHHS staff “worked quickly” and\nlocated a placement for Youth A to whom Youth A was discharged\non 6/30/2025.\nHospital Social Worker stated she has previously worked in child\nwelfare and knows Transitional Living Program must give 30-day\nnotice and cannot refuse to bring a child back to the facility. It was\nexplained to Hospital Social Worker that Transitional Living\nProgram’s Tillman House is an independent living home run by a\nchild placing agency after which she stated she thought it was a\nchild caring institution (CCI) so believed CCI contract\nrequirements applied to Youth A.\nExecutive Director responded to an email informing her of the\nallegations on 7/1/2025 by stating Youth A was placed into Tillman\nHouse after she was referred to the program by MDHHS staff.\nSince that time, Youth A has been hospitalized twice during which\ninformation was gained making it clear Youth A was not\nappropriate for placement in the agency’s independent living\nhome. Executive Director expressed concerns with Youth A’s\nseizures, as the home is not staffed around the clock, so there\nwon’t always be someone around to ensure Youth A’s safety\n2",
    "when the seizures occur. Executive Director reported Youth A’s\nlocal MDHHS office took over case management and were\nworking on placing Youth A back into a previous foster home on\n6/30/2025.\nFoster Care Worker 1, the Transitional Living Program foster\ncare worker assigned to Youth A’s case prior to her program\ntermination, responded to an email request for an interview on\n7/2/2025 stating he was on vacation adding he was on vacation at\nthe time of Youth A’s hospitalization and program termination.\nFoster Care Worker 2, the MDHHS worker assigned to Youth A\nprior to her placement in Tillman House, was interviewed by\nphone on 7/2/2025. She reported Youth A was referred to\nTransitional Living Program by a different MDHHS staff at the time\nof removal from her parental home. Youth A was subsequently\nplaced in a Transitional Placement Program (TPP) foster home\nwhile Transitional Living Program was considering Youth A for\nplacement, at which time MDHHS Worker was assigned as Youth\nA’s assigned Foster Care Worker. During that time, Youth A had\nseizures at school on two different occasions for which she went\nto the hospital but was not admitted. Foster Care Worker 2 stated\nYouth A was not given a diagnosis after either hospital visit. She\nstated, she attended a well-child visit with Youth A during which\nYouth A reported suffering a concussion prior to entering foster\ncare. Foster Care Worker 2 stated a referral was made for Youth\nA to see a neurologist, but the referral expired so it has not yet\nhappened. She reported Youth A was accepted into Transitional\nLiving Program’s Tillman House on 6/12/2025. Foster Care\nWorker 2 stated she did not inform Transitional Living Program\nstaff of the concussion history, the referral to a neurologist, or the\nseizures that had occurred while she was Youth A’s assigned\nfoster care worker.\nFoster Care Worker 2 reported after Youth A moved into Tillman\nHouse, she experienced another seizure, went to the hospital and\nwas discharged without a diagnosis. Youth A was again\nhospitalized for a seizure on 6/25/2025 and was diagnosed with\nPsychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES,) which is related to\nher mental health. Foster Care Worker 2 reported Executive\nDirector sent an email to the local office MDHHS Director, BSC\nDirector, and multiple other MDHHS staff indicating Transitional\nLiving Program would not be willing to take Youth A back to\nTillman House because they were not equipped to provide for\nYouth A’s mental health issues. She stated she believed Foster\nCare Worker 1 was still assigned to Youth A’s case in MiSACWIS,\n3",
    "but Foster Care Worker 2 took over locating a new placement for\nYouth A when Youth A was ready for discharge from the hospital.\nFoster Care Worker 2 was able to get Youth A placed back into\nher previous TPP home on 6/30/2025.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed by phone on 7/2/2025.\nShe stated she completed the intake of Youth A into Transitional\nLiving Program’s Tillman House on 6/12/2025 during which Foster\nCare Worker 2 was present with Youth A. Foster Care Supervisor\nstated, a few days after intake, Youth A told agency staff she had\na history of concussion and was supposed to see a neurologist .\nFoster Care Supervisor contacted Foster Care Worker 2 as she\nhad not told Foster Care Supervisor this information during intake.\nFoster Care Worker 2 told Foster Care Supervisor a referral to a\nneurologist had been made, but there had not yet been an\nappointment scheduled.\nFoster Care Supervisor reported on 6/19/2025, Youth A was taken\nto the hospital for seizure-like symptoms while at Tillman House\nand was released after being treated for a migraine. Foster Care\nSupervisor reached out to Foster Care Worker 2 expressing\nconcern with not having been provided with information about\nYouth A’s medical concerns/needs. On 6/25/2025, Youth A again\ndemonstrated seizure-like activity at Tillman House and was taken\nto the hospital after which she was admitted for testing and\ntreatment. Foster Care Supervisor reported Foster Care Worker 1\nreached out to her on the morning of 6/27/2025 while he was at\nthe hospital and told her he was concerned because Youth A\ncouldn’t identify herself or Foster Care Worker 1. Foster Care\nSupervisor went to the hospital to stay with Youth A. She stated\nYouth A had a bedside commode as she was unable to walk to\nget to the bathroom. While Foster Care Supervisor was with her,\nYouth A had another seizure. Foster Care Supervisor observed\nYouth A shaking while non-responsive after which she went into a\ncatatonic-like state. Foster Care Supervisor stated hospital staff\ntook Youth A’s vitals then left the room stating she was safe, and\nthey just needed to let the episode pass. Hospital staff informed\nFoster Care Supervisor they were diagnosing Youth A with PNES\nwhich is a psychological disorder. She stated they told her there\nwas no way to know when the seizures would occur, how frequent\nthey would occur, or what the severity could be. Foster Care\nWorker 1 sent an email the same day to Foster Care Worker 2\nwith a copy to Foster Care Supervisor, Foster Care Worker 2’s\nSupervisor and other local office leadership informing them of\nYouth A’s condition and the agency’s request for Foster Care\nWorker 2 to locate a new placement for Youth A as Tillman House\n4",
    "did not seem appropriate based on her condition and needs.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated Hospital Staff told her Youth A was\nready to be discharged with medication and a referral to\nCommunity Mental Health services. Since a psychotropic\nmedication consent form would need to be signed before Youth A\ncould be given the prescribed medication, Foster Care Worker 2\nbegan working on obtaining those signatures\nOn the following Monday, 6/30/2025, Foster Care Supervisor was\nat the hospital with Youth A who was still wobbly when trying to\nwalk and needed assistance to the bathroom. Foster Care\nSupervisor was present when Youth A met with a psychologist\nwho asked Youth A when she last self-harmed, to which she\nresponded, 6/5/2025. Youth A stated she told Foster Care Worker\n2 about this self-harming attempt. Foster Care Supervisor stated\nshe told the psychologist she was not comfortable with Youth A\ncoming back to Tillman House as the home is not staffed around\nthe clock and Youth A could come and go as she pleased, so\nthere might not be someone around if she had another seizure or\nattempted self-harm. Additionally, Foster Care Supervisor\nexpressed her concern that the local CMH is taking 4-6 weeks to\nsee youths and, even when an appointment was made, Youth A\ncould refuse to participate. The psychologist told Foster Care\nSupervisor he would talk with Hospital Social Worker.\nOn 6/30/2025 Foster Care Worker obtained Youth A’s father’s\nsignature on the psychotropic medication consent form, so Youth\nA was discharged with medication. Foster Care Supervisor\nreported Foster Care Worker 2 had secured a placement with\nYouth A’s previous caregiver to whom she was discharged. Foster\nCare Worker 1 took over case management responsibility that\nday; however, the change had not yet been made in the child’s\nrecord.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nTillman House Supportive Housing Program Statement which\nincludes the following regarding termination of\nservices/discharge:\n• If the youth is discharged, or the foster care case is closed,\nthe assigned foster care worker will work with the assigned\nMDHHS worker to ensure the youth is provided with\nplacement options appropriate to the youth’s level of\nindependence.\n• Prior to the youth’s case being closed, agency staff will\nwork to secure appropriate housing for the youth.\n5",
    "Emails forwarded by Foster Care Supervisor:\n• 6/16/2025 Foster Care Supervisor to Foster Care Worker 2\nstating Youth A reported having suffered a concussion in\nthe past and that she was experiencing ongoing headaches\nfor which she was supposed to see neurologist. Foster\nCare Supervisor requested details regarding Youth A’s\nmedical and neurological needs.\n• 6/16/2025 Foster Care Worker 2 to Foster Care Supervisor\nstating there was a referral to neurology.\n• 6/19/2025 from Foster Care Supervisor to Foster Care\nWorker 2 informing her Youth A had been taken to the\nhospital by ambulance for a possible seizure.\n• 6/20/2025 from Foster Care Supervisor to Foster Care\nWorker 2 stating Youth A was treated for migraine and\nreleased from the hospital. She expressed her concern\nabout not having been provided with any information about\na concussion or history of seizures.\n• 6/27/2025 from Foster Care Worker 1 to Foster Care\nWorker 2 stating he was at the hospital with Youth A who\nwas scheduled to see a psychiatrist for a mental health\nevaluation as she was not presenting any medical health\nconcerns. Foster Care 1 described Youth A’s condition and\nrequested MDHHS begin seeking a new placement for\nYouth A stating she may require a more structured and\nsupportive placement with a focus on mental health, which\nTransitional Living Program could not provide.\nSocial Work Contact in Youth A’s case record:\n• 6/4/2025 by Foster Care Worker 2 documenting she\nattended a well-child appointment with Youth A during\nwhich the physician recommended Youth A be referred to\npsychology and neurology due to depression, PTSD, and\npost-concussion symptoms.\nIncident Report in Youth A’s case record:\n• 6/19/2025 by Foster Care Worker 1 documenting that, at\n9:10 PM, Youth A went to the staff office stating she did not\nfeel well and reported a history of seizures. A call was\nmade to Emergency Medical Services as Youth A’s speech\n6",
    "became slurred prior to her closing her eyes and becoming\nunresponsive.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as they followed their written\nprocess when working with the youth’s MDHHS Worker to secure\nappropriate placement upon determining the youth was not\nappropriate for the agency’s independent living home after\ndiscovering mental health and neurological needs not disclosed to\nthe agency during the referral/acceptance process.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJuly 14, 2025\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 16, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
