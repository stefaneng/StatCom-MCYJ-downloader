    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Supervisor 1 allegedly \"slung\" a youth on the floor causing a\nscratch under his right eye and injuries.\nInvestigation There is no video footage of the incident.\nI spoke to Complainant 1 on 10/4/23 via telephone. Complainant 1\ndid not provide any new information.\nI spoke to Administrator 1 on 10/4/23. Administrator 1 reported\nthat Youth A’s last restraint was on 9/9/23. Administrator 1\nreported that Supervisor 1 was involved in the restraint as the\nsupervisor on 9/9/23. Administrator 1 reported that Youth A does\ncross his arms and squeeze them as self-harming behavior and\nthey have started, since these allegations, to keep a body chart for\nhim.\nI spoke to Foster Care Worker 1 on 10/4/23 and she reported that\nshe did not see any marks or bruises on Youth A when she visited\nhim on 9/26/23. Foster Care Worker 1 also reported that Youth A\nwill squeeze his arms to inflict harm to himself. Foster Care\nWorker 1 reported that Youth A has been involved in many\nincidents since he has been at placement.\nInterviews were conducted face to face at the facility on\n10/9/23 with DHHS Worker 1:\nYouth A:\nYouth A refused to talk to this consultant. No injuries were\nobserved by this consultant.\nSupervisor 1:\nSupervisor 1 reported that he has not restrained Youth A nor\nescorted him at any time throughout Youth A’s placement.\nSupervisor 1 reported he oversaw a restraint on 9/9/23 being\nconducted by Staff 2 and Staff 3. Supervisor 1 reported all the\nother youth were removed from the area and the staff on duty\nrestrained Youth A by holding his arms and Youth A then\ndeescalated within 2-3 minutes. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A did\nhave “flailing arms” during the restraint and was attempting to get\nout of it. Supervisor 1 reported the restraint went well. Supervisor\n1 reported he left the cottage after Youth A was deescalated.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A did not complain to him about\nreceiving any injuries or staff hurting him in any way. Supervisor 1\n2",
    "reported Youth A will throw himself down on the floor and hug\nhimself tightly when he doesn’t get his way.\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 was interviewed due to Youth A reporting to the on call\nDHHS Worker that Staff 1 was there at the time Supervisor 1\n“slung” him to the floor. Staff 1 reported that he has never been\ninvolved in a restraint with Youth A, or with anyone at the agency\nto date, and that he has never seen Supervisor 1 restrain Youth A,\nor push him, or throw him. Staff 1 reported that Youth A will act\nout when he hears the word “no.” Staff 1 reported Youth A will\nthrow himself up against the wall, ball up his fist, throw himself\nonto the floor, and try to break something to hurt himself. Staff 1\nreported he has never seen anyone restrain Youth A as of yet.\nStaff 1 reported he has been working for the agency about a\nmonth.\nI reviewed the following documents:\nThe agency schedule showed Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 have not\nworked at the same time.\nThe incident report dated 9/9/23 is consistent with Supervisor 1’s\naccount. Staff 2 and Staff 3 performed the restraint and\nSupervisor 1 was notified of the restraint. The incident reported\nthere were no injuries.\nThe Body Chart was reviewed for the 9/9/23 restraint, completed\nby Nurse 1, and Youth A had bruising on his upper bicep area.\nChart reported, “…bruising but claims it is not from anything but\nplaying on the playground…”\nSupervisor 1’s personnel file: All clearances were completed\naccording to Child Caring Institution Rules. All trainings were up to\ndate and there was not disciplinary action in his file.\nDHHS Worker 1 did not have any findings in his report.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to validate the allegations. Supervisor 1 was\nnot involved in a restraint with Youth A. Youth A reported that Staff\n1 was involved with the restraint with Supervisor 1 yet neither\nhave restrained or worked together per the schedule. The last\nincident report involving a restraint on 9/9/23 with no new ones to\nthis present day. Youth A refused to talk; therefore, there was no\nother information to gather.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/9/23\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
