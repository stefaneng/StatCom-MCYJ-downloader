INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection • (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nDescription suitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency was not communicating appropriately with other involved\nagencies regarding safety matters involving a foster youth. A\nfoster youth was placed in an unsafe placement by the agency.\nThe agency failed to utilize policy and relies on other agencies to\nguide them.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on September 23,\n2024. There was no additional information.\nDHHS POS Foster Care (FC) Supervisor was interviewed via\ntelephone on September 23, 2024. Youth A was court ordered to\nBiological Father’s care in March 2024. There is a termination\npetition pending for Youth A’s Mother. Since returning to Biological\nFather’s care there have been two Department of Health and\nHuman Services (DHHS) investigations due to concerns of\nphysical abuse. There is a history of physical abuse allegations\nregarding Biological Father. On 8/22/2024 a complaint came in\nregarding physical abuse of Youth A by Biological Father.\nDHHS POS FC Supervisor stated she received a phone call from\nthe Private Agency Foster Care (PAFC) because they were at the\nhospital with Youth A and were confused by what their role was as\nfar as safety planning. She stated she initially spoke with Director\nand then Program Manager. She stated the agency felt they\nweren’t getting the support they needed in order to safety plan.\nShe advised to have a discussion with Biological Father to see if\nhe would agree to allow Youth A to stay with a relative for the\nduration of the investigation. She stated the agency was confused\nbecause they didn’t feel they should be discussing the allegations\nwith Biological Father and didn’t know how to safety plan without\nproviding that information. DHHS POS FC Supervisor clarified\nYouth A had visible bruises on different areas of his body. She\nadvised Program Manager they had the ability to file a petition if\nBiological Father did not agree to the safety plan and there were\nimmediate concerns with returning Youth A to the household.\n2",
    "DHHS POS FC Supervisor stated she assisted the PAFC on\n8/22/2024 via phone when the new complaint came through by\nproviding the previously mentioned advice on how to move\nforward to Director and Program Manager. On 8/23/2024 she sent\na follow up email to inquire how Youth A was doing and how it\nwent with the safety plan and there was no response. She knew\nthey had been in contact with DHHS Worker and assumed there\nwas a safety plan in place and the investigation was moving\nforward. She didn’t hear from the PAFC until they sent an email\nregarding the court hearing where Biological Father was\ndismissed as a respondent. DHHS POS FC Supervisor stated\nevery time there is a difficult decision to make, the PAFC struggles\nwith simple case planning tasks. It’s been an issue with this\nparticular case from the beginning.\nDHHS POS FC Supervisor stated the PAFC sent an email to\nDHHS Worker to advise a court hearing was held earlier that day\nand Biological Father had been dismissed from the petition. There\nwas concern due to the ongoing DHHS investigation regarding\nphysical abuse. PAFC was asked via email if court was aware of\nthe DHHS investigation and ongoing concerns and was told by\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) that the court didn’t ask so it wasn’t\naddressed in court DHHS POS FC Supervisor advised the PAFC\nit was their responsibility to notify the court of Youth A’s progress\nand safety and this should have been addressed during the\nhearing. It was also learned when the agency sent an email to\nDHHS worker that Biological Father never agreed to a safety plan\nwhere Youth A was out of the house. The safety plan that was\nimplemented was Biological Father would refrain from physical\ndiscipline. Safety plan included Biological Father locking his doors\nat night due to reported sleepwalking and some of the physical\nabuse occurring while Biological Father was sleepwalking.\nDHHS POS FC Supervisor stated there was a meeting held\nrecently to discuss the DHHS investigation and it was determined\nDHHS would be substantiating Biological Father for physical\nabuse of Youth A. DHHS assisted the PAFC by having a\nconversation with Biological Father regarding an investigation\nupdate and Youth A is now safety planned out of the home.\nDHHS Worker was interviewed via telephone on October 2,\n2024. She stated FCW is a new worker and is trying her best but\ndoes lack experience. She stated Biological Father is going to be\nsubstantiated for physical abuse of Youth A and they are working\non filing a petition against Biological Father since he was recently\n3",
    "dismissed as a respondent on the active foster care case. She\nstated the agency was in communication with DHHS, but DHHS\ndoes not give dispositional findings ahead of time. She clarified\nbased on the bruising on Youth A, there was concern by all\ninvolved regarding his safety in Biological Father’s care. DHHS\nWorker stated there were miscommunications on all levels of this\ncase, specifically DHHS and PAFC. DHHS Worker also stated\nFCW always responded when she reached out and asked for\nanything.\nWhen this complaint was first assigned, the PAFC did follow\nthrough with taking Youth A for a medical assessment and safety\nplanning. She stated the agency did struggle somewhat with the\nsafety plan and knowing what to do, but acknowledged there was\nsome miscommunication on all parts. She stated PAFC was\naware of the concerns from the beginning. Despite knowing the\nconcerns, the agency participated in a court hearing regarding\nYouth A and did not disclose the current concerns and\ninvestigation to the court prior to Biological Father being dismissed\nas a respondent.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nOctober 4, 2024. She stated she is a new worker and has been\nassigned to Youth A’s case since the end of July, 2024. She\nstated she completed new worker training two weeks ago. FCW\nstated she was contacted by DHHS Worker regarding a new\ninvestigation involving concerns Youth A had been physically\nabused by Biological Father, who he is placed with. She stated\nshe and Program Manager (PM) were in the Detroit area and\nmade to face-to-face contact with Youth A along with the DHHS\nWorker after being notified of the new complaint. Youth A was\nobserved and had noticeable bruises on his body at the time face-\nto-face contact was made at a relative’s home. She clarified a\nrelative watches Youth A while Biological Father is at work.\nDuring the face-to-face meeting FCW and PM spoke to Youth A.\nFCW stated PM did the majority of the talking since she is a new\nworker. They took Youth A to the hospital and the social worker\nand multiple doctors agreed that Youth A should not return home\ndue to the concerns of physical abuse. FCW and PM weren’t sure\nhow that would work. They spoke with DHHS Worker and inquired\nwhat they should do from there. FCW stated she and PM recall\nDHHS Worker stating that if Biological Father refused to allow\nYouth A to go somewhere else for the time being they can’t move\nhim. However, during a follow up meeting, DHHS Worker stated\nshe didn’t say that, and they could have filed a petition based on\n4",
    "the concerns. FCW stated they followed the guidance they were\ngiven but during a later meeting with DHHS POS FC Supervisor\nand DHHS Worker, there were different statements made.\nDHHS Worker provided a summary of actions that needed to\noccur. She advised FCW and PM to take Youth A to the hospital\nto be checked due to the bruising. FCW stated there was\nconfusion since that is something that a DHHS worker would\ntypically do. FCW and PM both spoke with Biological Father\nregarding a safety plan. They attempted to safety plan to have\nYouth A stay elsewhere, however Biological Father was upset and\nrepeatedly stated he didn’t have anywhere for Youth A to go, and\nthe bruises could have come from other individuals. FCW stated\nshe and PM were under the impression that since Biological\nFather refused to allow Youth A to stay somewhere else, there\nwasn’t anything else they could do. The agency then modified the\nsafety plan to include Biological Father and Youth A locking their\nbedroom doors at night since Biological Father indicated he\nsleepwalks and when he does that, he hits Youth A. A few days\nlater, DHHS Worker contacted FCW, and she was told about\nBiological Father refusing to follow the safety plan and there was\nno mention of an emergency petition. DHHS Worker requested\nthe agency work on an improved safety plan that included not to\nuse physical discipline which Biological Father ended up agreeing\nto and signing.\nFCW did not realize she needed to provide an update to the court\nregarding the allegations. She was under the impression she only\ntestifies to home visits she completed. At court, FCW testified to\nher contact with Youth A and Biological Father regarding her\ninteractions at home visits. After the court hearing, DHHS Worker\nemailed her and asked if the court was made aware of the recent\nconcerns. FCW and her coworkers were under the impression that\nDHHS would bring up concerns regarding their involvement. The\ncourt hearing occurred via Zoom and PM sat next to her but did\nnot speak up to notify the court. FCW stated she did not notify the\ncourt or any of the attorneys involved that DHHS was involved due\nto concerns of physical abuse. She was told to write a court report\nand provide Parent Agency Treatment Plan’s (PATP’s). She\nwasn’t aware she needed to update everyone as much as\npossible prior to court. A video call was held after court to\ndetermine if there were any course of action the PAFC could take\nto notify the court regarding the concern and “undo” the motion\nand was told that was not possible. FCW stated if she had known\nshe needed to provide all of the information she would have.\n5",
    "Program Manager (PM) was interviewed via telephone on\nOctober 4, 2024. She clarified her position is Program Manager,\nhowever she is acting as the FC supervisor on this case since she\nprevious experience with the case as a licensing supervisor and\nFC supervisor. She became aware of the DHHS investigation\ninvolving concerns of physical abuse of Youth A by Biological\nFather on 8/22/24. She stated the experience with DHHS on this\ninvestigation was different from her experience with other DHHS\ninvestigations in the past and there was some confusion. In this\nsituation the DHHS worker asked the PAFC to safe plan based on\nthe allegations she was investigating as opposed to the DHHS\nworker doing the safety plan. She isn’t aware of the DHHS worker\ndoing a safety plan on her own until just recently. PM clarified\nthere have been 4 safety plans since the investigation started.\nDHHS Worker told them to safety plan and PM inquired if there\nwas anything specific to include in the plan and she said the\nagency can choose what to include in the safety plan. They asked\nwhat to do if Biological Father doesn’t agree to out of home\nplacement and DHHS Worker said they can’t force him to agree to\nthat safety plan and if this occurs, she should talk to PAFC’s upper\nmanagement\nFCW and PM arrived at the relative home where Youth A was\nlocated and DHHS Worker joined roughly 30 minutes later. Upon\narriving, DHHS Worker asked them to take Youth A for a medical\nevaluation. They took him to a Children’s Hospital in Detroit.\nBiological Father would not agree to out of home placement.\nBiological Father had reported the bruising occurred when he was\nsleepwalking, therefore the safety plan included Youth A not\nfalling asleep in Biological Father’s room. The plan also included\nto have Biological Father lock his bedroom door so Youth A\ncouldn’t get in. Agency sent the safety plan to DHHS Worker, and\nshe asked them to also include no physical discipline, so they did\nan addendum to the initial safety plan.\nPM stated FCW is a new worker and recently completed CWTI\nwithin the last 2 weeks. PM stated they had not received direction\nfrom DHHS regarding the investigation, therefore she did not\ninstruct FCW to discuss the physical abuse concerns during the\nrecent court hearing on 9/16/2024. She stated she isn’t familiar\nwith DHHS investigations that involve biological parents and\nacknowledged she could have done a better job preparing FCW\nfor the court hearing and what information should have been\nshared. She also stated the communication during the DHHS\ninvestigation could have been better. The PAFC was on the\n6",
    "property, but they were not present when DHHS Worker\ninterviewed Youth A so they were not aware of what information\nwas disclosed at that time and were only provided a brief\nsummary of Youth A’s disclosure after the meeting.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• 9/16/2024 court order states Biological Father is released\nfrom the case.\n• Youth A’s MISACWIS case file. Reviewed social work\ncontacts between 8/22/2024-10/7/2024.\n• 8/22/2024 social work contacts: Multiple bruises viewed on\nYouth A’s body. Youth A was taken for a medical\nevaluation and a safety plan was developed after speaking\nwith DHHS worker. PAFC contacted DHHS POS FC\nSupervisor and expressed uncertainty on how to proceed\nas DHHS Worker was not offering assistance regarding the\nsafety plan.\n• 8/23/2024 social work contact: DHHS POS FC Supervisor\nsent email to PAFC regarding status of Youth A. No\nresponse received.\n• 9/3/2024 social work contact: PAFC spoke with DHHS\nWorker regarding updated safety plan for Youth A to\ninclude no physical discipline.\n• 9/19/2024 social work contact: FCW sent an email to\nDHHS Worker and DHHS POS FC Supervisor informing\nthem court jurisdiction closed on Biological Father. Concern\nexpressed regarding the court case closure regarding\nBiological Father and current concerns of physical abuse.\nQuestions as to whether or not court was made aware of\nconcerns and FCW indicated it was not brought up or\ndiscussed during the court hearing.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance. During interviews\nconducted there is acknowledgement that communication could\nhave been better between DHHS Worker and PAFC, however,\ngiven FCW is very new to child welfare there should have been\nclear direction from experienced supervision to instruct her to\nprovide the court with an accurate update regarding concerns of\nphysical abuse of Youth A by Biological Father. PAFC did not\nmake the court aware of the concerns despite being actively\ninvolved and court jurisdiction was terminated on Biological\nFather, impacting the safety needs of Youth A. A new petition has\nbeen filed on Biological Father as a result of being substantiated\nfor physical abuse of Youth A and Youth A has been removed\nfrom Biological Father’s care.\nConclusion Violation Established\n7",
