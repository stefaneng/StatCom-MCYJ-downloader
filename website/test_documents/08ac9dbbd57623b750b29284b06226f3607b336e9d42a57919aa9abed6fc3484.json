    "summary": "A 13-year-old and a 16-year-old in a licensed placement engaged in sexual intercourse, but the investigation found that Oakland County DHHS, as a licensed Child Placing Agency, did not violate reporting rules because the DHHS employee who was informed of the incident was not an employee under that specific license. The report concludes that no violation was established. The lack of substantiated violation hinges on a technical distinction between employees, not on whether the incident was reported.",
