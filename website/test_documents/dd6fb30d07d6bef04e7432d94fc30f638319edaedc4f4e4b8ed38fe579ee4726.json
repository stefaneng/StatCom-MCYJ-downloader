Chief\nAdministrator stated that Youth A initially indicated the injuries to\nYouth B were caused by “horse play”. However, Chief\nAdministrator reviewed the video and could clearly see that was\ninaccurate. Youth B was moved to another floor of the facility, to\nprevent contact with Youth A. Youth A is also placed on one-to-\none supervision and staff have been instructed that he is not to be\nwithin ten feet of Youth B at any time. Nor will the youth travel\ntogether for any reason.

Youth B was in the hospital at the\ntime. Law Enforcement was also unwilling to review the video or\nphotos of Youth B’s injuries.\n2",
    "Chief Administrator stated that Youth B had difficulty recalling\nwhat happened. Youth A was attempting to gaslight Youth B by\ntelling everyone it was an accident, and they were just playing.\nChief Administrator reported there were no incidents earlier in the\nday between the two youth that would have predicted this assault.\nChief Administrator reported a 30-day notice was in place to have\nYouth A removed from the facility.\nOn 7/15/24 a face-to-face interview with Staff 3 was completed in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker.

Youth B recalled staff telling\nhim to go to his room several times.\nYouth B stated that on 7/11/24, while in the lounge, Youth A\nwalked up behind him and stated they needed to talk. Youth A\nthen put Youth B in a choke hold. Youth B thought Youth A was\nplaying around at first. But then Youth A squeezed his neck harder\nand Youth B realized he was serious. Youth B hit Youth A's arm,\nbut did not remember much after that, as he passed out. Youth B\nwas told he hit the floor with his face. Youth B recalled going to\nthe hospital for medical attention.

Youth C stated Youth A and Youth B usually got\nalong, although he witnessed them fighting before. Youth C\nreported that he was punched by Youth A once a few weeks ago.\nYouth C stated that he believed Youth A was homicidal. Youth C\nstated that Youth A was never in trouble with the police when\nthese things happen, so Youth A thinks he will never get in\ntrouble. Youth C was asked if he felt safe with Youth A at the\nfacility. Youth C stated he did not know how to answer that\nquestion.\nOn 7/15/24 a face-to-face interview with Youth D was completed\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker.

Staff 1 was positioned at the lounge\ndoor and therefore knew both youth were in there. Staff 1 should\nhave redirected the youth to their rooms and kept them in line of\nsight until they complied. If Staff 1 was struggling with this, she\nshould have called on the radio for assistance.\nOn 8/9/24 a video conference was held with Foster Care Worker.\nFoster Care Worker reported the plan was to move Youth A from\nthe facility, as he was not appropriate to be there.

It was unknown if\ncharges would be filed.\nOn 8/20/24 Staff 1 was interviewed by MDHHS Worker. DCWL\nmade an attempt to interview Staff 1 on 8/22/24. However, she\ndeclined, stating that she no longer worked at the facility and\nalready spoke with MDHHS Worker about the incident.

Staff 2 was unaware that Youth A had gone into\nthe lounge. Staff 2 stated there were no incidents earlier that day\nbetween the two youth that would have been a precursor to this\nincident. Staff 2 asked Youth A why he attacked Youth B. Youth A\nanswered that Youth B “snitched” on him but did not give any\nother details.\nVideo Reviewed\nStaff 1 was sitting in a chair in the hallway, with her back to the\nwall and her left side against the frame of the lounge doorway.\nYouth B walked into the lounge, past Staff 1. The lounge was\ndark, as the lights were not on. Youth A then walked into the\nlounge, past Staff 1. Staff 1 did not turn to watch Youth A in the\nroom or turn the lights on.

He got\nme in a choke hold, then I passed out. He didn’t mean to\nmake me bleed. So I do not blame him. It was my fault for\nnot being in my room like I was supposed to.”\n• 7/12/24 written statement by Youth A: “I accidentally\nchoked him (Youth B) out.
