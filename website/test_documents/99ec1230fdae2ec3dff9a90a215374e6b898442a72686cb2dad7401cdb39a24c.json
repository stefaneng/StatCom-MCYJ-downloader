An in-person interview was held with\nthe Program Manager (PM). She was advised of the allegations and\nconfirmed that Youth B was no longer placed at the facility. She also\nconfirmed that Youth A remained and was at the facility today. PM\n2",
    "advised that during the two-week time frame that was provided as an\nalleged time when the incident occurred, both Youth A and Youth B\nwere in quarantine together due to COVID 19 exposure. Per PM the\nyouth were in quarantine together from 11/12/22 to 11/27/22. PM\nexplained that during waking hours all exposed youth remained in the\nquarantine unit and during sleeping hours all youth are relocated to one\nunit and separated in the different areas of the unit. I completed a walk\nthrough of the area and found there to be adequate space and distance\nin the area to allow for continued isolation of the exposed youth. PM\nadvised that all youth were combined together in one area around 8-\n9pm. Per PM, during the afternoon shift they were always staffed with\ntwo youth care workers. PM reported that during the alleged timeframe\nof 11/12/22 to 11/27/22 Staff 1 and Staff 2 were staffed on Tuesday and\nWednesday for the afternoon shift. PM reported that Youth A reported\nthe allegations to Staff 1 on the morning of 12/20/22. Youth A reported\nthat it occurred on second shift on a Tuesday or Wednesday and that\nStaff 2 was the only staff present. PM reported that the agency was\nfully staffed during that time and both Staff 1 and Staff 2 were on shift.\nOn 12/21/2022 an interview was completed with the complainant.\nThere were no additional concerns reported.\nOn 12/21/2022 an in-person meeting was held with Youth A. Youth A\ntook me on a tour of the unit that was being utilized as the quarantine\nunit in November 2022. He confirmed that he was comfortable at the\nfacility and currently feels safe. An interview of Youth A was not\ncompleted at that time as it had not been confirmed if law enforcement\nclearance had been provided.\nOn 01/12/2023 an in-person interview was completed with Youth A at\nCFC. Youth A reported that he was “raped” by Youth B and was not\nable to yell for help. He also reported that Youth B threatened him and\nstated he would “beat his ass” if he yelled. Youth A defined rape as\nmaking “me suck his penis”. He further reported that only he and Youth\nB were in the rear of the unit because they were in quarantine. Youth A\nreported that only Staff B was in the unit with them and reported he was\nnot sitting in a position where he could see them. When asked if he\nrecalled seeing the staff walk around and monitor, he replied he could\nnot remember. he saw staff Youth A reported that the incident occurred\nduring second shift at about 9 or 9:30 pm. Youth A then reported that\nhe told staff, but no one really listened. He was unable to recall who or\nwhen he told the staff and specifically indicated “I forgot”. Youth A\ndenied that it had happened before and reported that it had not\nhappened again.\n4",
    "On 01/21/2023 an in-person interview was completed with Staff 1 at\nCFC. Staff 1 reported that she is a youth care worker and has been\nemployed with the agency since July 2022. She reported that she\nworks second shift (2pm to 10pm) every Sunday -Thursday. Staff 1\nreported that she was sitting at the staff table in Unit 2 alone and Youth\nA asked if she could tell her something. She responded yes and stated\nthat Youth A stated that Youth B raped him. Staff 1 stated that she did\nnot go into detail with him, but immediately reported it to PM and\nResidential Care Supervisor (RCS). She confirmed that she was\nworking during the quarantine days between 11/12/22 and 11/27/22.\nStaff 1 reported that she specifically monitored Youth A and Youth B\nand does not ever recall seeing any inappropriate exchange between\nthe two. She also reported that she recalled that Youth B was very\n“grossed out” by a medical condition that Youth A had which required\nhim to wear a diaper and have frequent cleanings and changes by staff,\nand as a result he would not engage with him. She denied that there\nwas a time that both her and Staff 2 were providing supervision of the\nyouth. She further denied that any other youth have expressed\nconcerns regarding inappropriate behavior involving Youth A or Youth\nB. Staff 1 reported that Youth B has a history with aggressive behavior\ntoward staff, but not other youth in the facility. Lastly, Staff 1 denied\nthere was a time that she is aware of that the facility was out of ratio\ncompliance.\nOn 01/12/2023 in-person interviews were held with Youth C, Youth D\nand Youth E at CFC. They all denied hearing or seeing Youth A or\nYouth B engage inappropriate behavior with other youth. They all also\nreported that they were not in the quarantine unit, but have shared a\nunit with Youth A or Youth B after 11/27/22. They all denied that there\nwere times that they were aware of the agency not being in compliance\nwith staffing ratio.\nOn 02/08/2023 a phone interview was completed with Staff 2. It should\nbe noted that Staff 2 is no longer employed by the agency. Staff 2\nconfirmed that he was previously employed by the agency and worked\n2nd shift which was from 2pm to 10pm. He recalled that when he\nreturned to work around 12/20/22 or 12/21/22, he was asked some\nquestions about the monitoring of Youth A and Youth B because Youth\nA had made some allegations about inappropriate behavior by Youth B.\nStaff 2 recalled that the agency had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak\nand had some youth that were in quarantine due to exposure. He\nconfirmed that Youth A and Youth B were being housed in the rear of\nthe unit after “fall in time” which he defined as after 8pm. He reported\nthat both he and Staff 1 would be in the unit with the youth and Staff 1\nwas primarily assigned to monitor Youth A and Youth B to ensure they\nwere following isolation protocol. He reported that when both were\n4",
    "present, he monitored the front and Staff 1 monitored the back. Staff 2\nreported that Staff 1 ended her shift at 8pm and when she would leave\nfor the night, he would walk from the front and back to thoroughly\nmonitor the youth. He reported that he would stand and sit mostly in\nthe middle for the best monitoring, especially after the cameras were\nturned off. Staff 2 also reported that he took pictures of all of his\ndocumentation because he wanted to make sure he had copies of what\nhe was reporting. Staff 2 denied seeing any inappropriate contact\nbetween any youth and specifically between Youth A and Youth B. He\nalso denied that there was ever a time that he was not monitoring\nbehavior of the youth. He confirmed that the youth would be down (or\nin bed) for the night by 8pm. Staff 2 denied that he was advised by\nYouth A of any inappropriate behavior that happened to him while\nplaced at CFC.\nOn 02/09/2023 a video interview was completed with Youth B. He\nconfirmed that he was previously placed at CFC and recalled being in\nquarantine with Youth A. He could not recall the specific dates he was\nin quarantine, but stated it was after Halloween and before Christmas.\nHe recalled that only he and Youth A were in quarantine together. He\nreported that during the day they were in one unit, but at night they\nwent next door to another unit and sleep in the back of the unit. He\nreported that they had to sleep in the back to quarantine because they\nhad been exposed to COVID-19. Youth B reported that staff would be\nin the area supervising them and would not leave unless another staff\ncame to give them a break. He reported that the staff would be in the\nfront and the back of the unit. Youth B denied that there was any time\nthat staff was not present in the unit. He also denied that he and Youth\nA engaged in any type of inappropriate activity.\nThe following documents were reviewed as a part of the investigation:\n• Face sheets for all youth interviewed: Face sheets include\nidentifying information for each youth\n• Incident Report: Documented report of Youth A to Staff 1 of\ninappropriate sexual contact by Youth B. Incident report also\nindicates that Youth A reported that only Staff 2 was present\nduring the incident.\n• Written statement submitted by Youth A: The written account\nof what Youth A reported.\n• Unit Shift Log Entries from 11/12/22 to 11/27/22\n• SST Shift Log Entries from 11/12/22 to 11/27/22\n• Staff schedule for afternoon shift for CFC from 11/12/22 to\n11/27/22 Confirms schedule of both Staff 1 and Staff 2. Also\nconfirms that Staff 1 worked beyond 8pm\n4",
    "Analysis At the conclusion of the investigation there was not sufficient evidence\nto support non-compliance of licensing Rule 400.4126 via a lack of\nsupervision of youth by CFC staff. Two staff and one youth that were\ninterviewed all deny that there was a time that staff was not properly\nsupervising youth in the unit. There is a discrepancy between the\nreports of Youth A and Youth B regarding inappropriate contact\nbetween the youth, however there is no evidence to support that any\ninappropriate contact that occurred was a result of lack of supervision\nby the staff.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was provided with technical assistance regarding licensing\nrule R400.4127(4). In order to accommodate for the proper quarantine\nof youth that had been exposed to COVID-19, an alternative sleeping\narrangement was developed. Staff typically set in the room with youth\nwhile they are sleeping, however, the alternative sleeping arrangement\ncaused Youth A and Youth B to be outside of the direct line of sight of\nstaff. Although no one reported lack of supervising, there is not proper\ndocumentation to show that checks during sleeping hours were\ncompleted at varying intervals not exceeding 15 minutes.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy.\nIt is recommended that the current license status be continued.\n02/10/2023\n________________________________________________________________\nCassandra Thomas Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 13, 2023\n___________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
