The placement specifications must include\nall the following:\n(a) The age, number, SOGIE, race, ethnic background,\nand characteristics of children preferred by the\napplicants.\nThree of six foster home files held renewal evaluations that did not identify\nr ecommendations regarding SOGIE.\nCPA Rule 400.12326 Borrowed home\n(1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by\nanother agency the borrowing agency shall have a\nrecord containing all the following:\n(f) Documentation that the foster parent has received\norientation to the policies of the borrowing agency.\nOne of three borrowed home files did not have documentation that agency\norientation to policies and procedures was reviewed.",
    "CPA Rule 400.12326 Borrowed home\n(1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by\nanother agency, the borrowing agency shall have a\nrecord containing all the following:\n(g) A copy of the foster parent/agency agreement\nsigned by the foster parent and the borrowing agency\nOne of three borrowed home files did not have documentation the foster parent\nagency agreement was reviewed or signed.\nCPA Rule 400.12327 Special evaluation\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation,\nan agency shall complete a written report that includes\nall the following information:\n(d) Findings of fact, based upon the evaluation.\nOne of two special evaluations did not document interviews with members of the\nhousehold that were present during the alleged incident. The report also did not\ndocument any investigation into a secondary allegation.\nFOM 722-06B Family Team Meeting\nFTMs must occur within the required time frames as\noutlined in the following tables:\nUpdated Case Plan (USP)- within 30 calendar days\nbefore the case plan due date.\nThree of three foster care files and one of one independent living files, each held\none family team meeting that was not completed within 30 days prior to a USP.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n8/23/23 INTERIM, CAP approved 9/6/23\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Special Evaluations: When conducting a special evaluation in coordination\nwith DHHS, the agency must work cooperatively with DHHS. However, the\nagency must also complete a thorough investigation that can stand alone and\naddress all allegations thoroughly when read independently from the DHHS\nreport. This means completion of interviews with all involved persons or\nwitnesses, and documentation of investigation and outcome for each",
    "allegation. DCWL consultants are available for ongoing consultation as\nneeded.\n• Enrolled applicants: The agency was advised to keep case contacts updated\nwith enrolled applicants. Updated contacts help demonstrate ongoing\nprogress toward certification.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• There was no consultation requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\n• The agency interim inspection was completed on 8/23/23 with a CAP\napproved on 9/6/23. The agency was cited for six violations. Of those\nsix violations there was improvement in most areas. There was one\nrepeat violation regarding Family Team Meetings(FTM). Additional\ncorrective action planning is needed regarding timely FTMs to ensure\ncontinued reduction of violations.\n• Special Investigation 2024C0001093SI was completed 2/22/24. The\ninvestigation determined a violation of PA 116 722.120, as a caseworker\ninaccurately documented that a home visit was completed with a child,\nwhen the visit did not occur. A CAP was approved on 2/26/24.\nCompliance verification is ongoing.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed on-site. The\nagency reported continued difficulty in staffing, as there have been few qualified\napplicants that have applied for open positions. The staffing shortage has also\nimpacted the agency's ability to accept cases from referral sources. Which has\nresulted in much lower case counts over the past several months.",
    "In addition to hiring, the agency continues to focus on staff retention and have\nongoing conversations with current staff to address their needs and promote a\nsupportive workplace.\nThe agency reported they have successfully implemented the 2023 CAP. Staff\nmeet quarterly to review CAP items and discuss progress. The Chief Administrator\nindicated any repeat violations are likely due to systemic issues, as the agency felt\nconfident with CAP compliance.\nThe agency reported one disrupted placement during the review period, due to\nfindings from a DHHS investigation.\nFinancial Overview\nThe 2023 financial audit has not been completed yet. The 2024 budget was\nreviewed, and no financial concerns were found.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. Both staff reported being with the agency for\nover a year. One staff as a foster care case manager and the other as a licensing\nworker. Both staff stated they felt very supported in their work. They both reported\ntheir supervisor was knowledgeable, supportive, available, and able to help them\nproblem solve. Neither staff had any suggestions nor identified areas for\nimprovement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2023 review. The\noffice is clean and easily accessible to clients. There is adequate space for staff\nand clients to interact. There is sufficient locked storage for confidential\ninformation.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nSafety Alert #1: On 4/24/24 the home was found to lack a carbon monoxide\ndetector.\nResolution: On 4/25/24 the agency purchased a carbon monoxide detector and\ninstalled it in the home. A photo was provided to DCWL as verification.\nSafety Alert #2: After multiple attempted contacts, the relative caregiver was non-\ncompliant in scheduling a visit with the DCLW analyst. The agency was informed on\n4/10/24.\nResolution: On 4/11/24 the agency made phone contact with the relative\ncaregiver. The relative reported she would contact the DCWL analyst. However,\nthis did not occur. On 4/17/24 the agency completed a home visit to verify well-\nbeing of the child. No concerns were noted. The relative stated she was too busy to\nmeet with the analyst.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
