    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 An institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the\nfollowing information prior to employment or at the time\nspecified in this rule:\n(e) Three dated references which are obtained prior to\nemployment from persons unrelated to the employee and\nwhich are less than 12 months old.\nSeven employees were reviewed. Two out of seven employees\ndid not have three references. One employee had one reference\nin their file and the other employee had two references.\nR 400.4144 Admission health screening; physical examinations.\n(3) Sufficient health history information shall be\ndocumented for each resident to assure proper medical\ncare.\nTwo youth files were reviewed. One out of two files did not have\nsufficient health history information documented. The forms\ncreated by the agency are sufficient. The writer did not provide\ninformation in all sections.\n4",
    "2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MSA violation. Please note that there\nare additional MSA requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility\nis in compliance will all additional MSA requirements except for the following: NA\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract/Policy violation. Please\nnote that there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following: NA\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR 400.4112 (3) (K): The TB test results must be in before a staff can work with the\nyouth. The agency’s TB test date on two employees were after the hire date. This is\nnot a non-compliance unless they have worked with the youth. If the agency is going\nto continue this pattern of testing, then there will need to be a “hire date” and then a\n“work with youth” date present for verification of compliance of this rule. The agency\nis free to decide how to incorporate this distinction in their personnel files.\nR 400.4166 (a). The agency discharge forms have worker and supervisor signature\nlines to verify completion of the reports. All of these forms should be signed and\ndated.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nI discussed with the agency a need to have more structure surrounding the filing\nprocess. Currently, the process for placing case notes and therapy notes into the\nyouth’s file happens at discharge. After reviewing discharged files, the therapy and case\nnotes were not filed. It would benefit the agency to have a more structured process.\nThis may include weekly updating the file (youth leave within 30 days). Or after\ncompletion of case notes, printing them off and placing them in the file immediately. The\nagency only had two youth for placement at the time of the audit so this may not feel as\nimmediate right now, but once the agency increases capacity, this area will be important\nto stay current.\n5",
    "I also discussed forms being filled out completely. The agency forms are well written\nand the writers should be filling out each section of the forms accurately and completely.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MSA requirements. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective\naction plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular\nlicense.\n6/14/21\n________________________________________\nVenus M.
