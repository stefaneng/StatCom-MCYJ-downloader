INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n1",
    "(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing a youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 hit Youth A in the face after Youth A hit him.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI attempted to contact Complainant on 5/2/25 and 5/5/25.\nComplainant did not return phone calls.\nAll interviews were conducted with MDHHS Worker.\nYouth A was interviewed on 5/2/25 at the facility. She reported on\n5/1/25 she was told by a staff that she would be moving units.\nYouth A reported she was upset by this news. Youth A reported\nshe was in the hallway outside of her unit when she received this\ninformation and began kicking the walls around her. Youth A\nreported she kicked the walls, broke the walls, and then picked up\nthe drywall pieces and threw at staff or attempted to hit them with\nthe drywall. Youth A reported she punched Staff 1 and then he\npunched her back in the face. Youth A reported Staff 1 and\nSupervisor 2 placed her in a restraint, but she dropped to ground,\nresulting in both staff releasing her from the restraint. Youth A\nreported there were other staff around, but they didn’t see\nanything. Youth A reported the other staff were Staff 2 and Staff 3.\nWhen Youth A was asked to explain the events in greater detail,\nshe stated she “blacked out” and could not remember anymore.\nYouth A reported she did not have any scratches on her face or\nmarks from Staff 1. Youth A reported she saw the nurse after the\nrestraint.\nStaff 1 was interviewed at the facility on 5/21/25. Staff 1 reported\nhe came in for his afternoon shift around 3:00pm. Youth A was\nupset and in the hallway. She was kicking the walls, causing the\ndrywall to break. Staff 1 reported Youth A picked up the drywall\npieces and was threw them at staff and attempted to hit staff with\nthe pieces. Staff 1 reported they were substantial sizes. Staff 1\nreported because of the damage to the walls and the removal of\nthe drywall, pipes and electrical wires were exposed. Youth A\ncontinued to kick at these items, and it was then decided to place\nher in a restraint. Staff 1 reported Staff 3, Staff 5, and Staff 4 were\nin the hallway. Staff 3 and Staff 1 attempted to place Youth A in a\nCPI high hold. This was described as two staff, one on each side,\n2",
    "tucking her elbows to her body to stop movement from Youth A.\nBecause Youth A was aggressively fighting this, the hold did not\nwork, and she was released. Youth A began to kick and throw\ndrywall again. Youth A then targeted Staff 1 and began coming\nafter him with drywall in her hand and threatening him. Staff 1 and\nStaff 5 placed her in a two man hold and again could not maintain\nthis due to her physical aggression. Staff 1 described her\naggression as spitting, punching and yelling. Staff 1 reported he\nattempted to move away from her and was backing away due to\nnow being the target of her aggression. Youth A began to throw\npunches at him and a staff (unknown) placed themselves in the\nmiddle of these punches to block them. Staff 1 was backing away\nfrom her and was able to remove himself from the hallway. Staff 1\nreported he never punched her or hit her in anyway. Staff 1 did not\nsee if she had any scratches on her.\nStaff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, and Supervisor 2 were interviewed\nseparately via telephone with MDHHS Worker on 5/29/25. Staff 5\nwas interviewed via telephone on 6/23/25. Each staff reported\nthey were involved in the situation on 5/2/25 with Youth A. All\nreported Youth A was physically aggressive and kicking the walls.\nAll reported Youth A was using the drywall as a weapon against\nstaff. All reported the holes in the wall exposed piping and\nelectrical wires; therefore, a restraint was attempted but never fully\ncompleted. None of the staff reported the attempted restraint was\ndone outside of CPI. All the staff reported Youth A was the\naggressor and Staff 1 never punched or hurt Youth A. All staff\nreported they did not see any scratches or marks on Youth A due\nto the restraint.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via telephone with MDHHS Worker\non 5/29/25. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A was aggressively\nattacking Staff 1 by “throwing punches” and drywall. Supervisor 1\nreported the attempted restraints were done well, they were just\nunable to maintain the positions due to Youth A’s aggressive\nnature. Supervisor 1 reported there were no marks or scratches\non Youth A. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 did not hit or punch\nYouth A.\nVideo Observation:\nVideo was dated 5/1/25 from 3:22:53-3:24:01pm. Youth A is\nvisibly kicking the wall and removing drywall from the wall. She is\nseen throwing the drywall at staff and holes are exposed in the\nwall. Staff 1 and Staff 3 attempt to restraint and Youth A\nimmediately becomes aggressive and pushes through the staff\n3",
    "and is released from the hold. Youth A is seen punching and\nswinging her arms at Staff 1. Staff 1 is moving backwards.\nAnother restraint is attempted by Staff 1 and Staff 5. At 3:23:28,\nStaff 1 and Staff 5 have Youth A in a Standing High Hold, but she\nmaneuvered out of this hold at 3:23:49. Youth A continued to\nattack Staff 1. Multiple staff attempted to block her from hitting\nStaff 1, by trying to hold her back. Staff 1 is seen backing away\nfrom Youth A with his arms extended, while Youth A is physically\nattacking him. Staff 1 obtains enough physical distance from\nYouth A to leave the hallway. At 3:24:01 Youth A sits on the\nground.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the incident report dated 5/1/25. The report is in\nagreement with the verbal interviews noted. Youth A was\nseen by the nurse and was given her inhaler and an ice\npack for her head. No marks were noted.\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. Central registry was\ncompleted on 3/18/24. CPI was completed on 1/14/2025.\nStaff 1 does not have disciplinary action that is applicable\nto this allegation.\n• I reviewed the Behavior Management Policy. The policy\noutlines CPI as an acceptable intervention. It also outlines\ninterventions that are prohibited.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Video observation as well\nas interviews with staff reveal Youth A was the aggressor in the\nsituation and no staff involved physically attacked Youth A. All\nstaff involved did well securing the hallway and following the CPI\ninterventions. Staff 1, when he realized he had turned into the\ntarget of Youth A, removed himself from the situation.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n6/23/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
