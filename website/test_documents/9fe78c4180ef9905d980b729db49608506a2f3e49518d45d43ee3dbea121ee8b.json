DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThe West Campus Building was formerly a part of Wedgwood’s Kentwood Campus, but\nafter renovations, a new population, different policies / procedures, and different staffing\nratio, the need for a different license was determined.\nThe well maintained and clean building is brick construction and has recently been\nrenovated. It is comprised of two living units – each able to accommodate twelve\nresidents. The living area is spacious and provides for good staff eyes on supervision.\nThe two living units are divided by a classroom area and a third living area designed to\nkeep residents in smaller groups. Eventually, the program plans to provide respite beds\nto DHS and area CMH’s and will utilize this area for separate daytime programming.\n2",
    "B. Program Description\nThe Parramore Home has functioned for nearly two years as a residential program\nserving autistic children and adolescents. Until now, it has been a part of Wedgwood’s\nKentwood Campus. With the expansion of D.D. Services to a second living unit\n[VanderArk Home], specialized services can be better provided under a separate\nlicense.\nThe Parramore Home’s focus is on the secure treatment of autistic children and\nadolescents. Staff have been specifically trained to support this population. The\nVanderArk Home’s program focus will be on developmentally disabled children and\nadolescents with oppositional or acting out behaviors. While doors are locked for\nresident safety, residents have access to a wide variety of on-campus and off-campus\nactivities and programs that include two gymnasiums, a health club with exercise\nequipment, and a coffee house. Wedgwood also has a large grassy campus for walking,\nsports, and other physical activity. Therapeutically, the program provides a parent\nsupport group, life skills teaching, Functional Behavioral Analysis, Applied Behavioral\nAnalysis, Sensory Integration Services, Speech and Language Services, Occupational\nTherapy Services, individual therapy, and family therapy. Residents have access to the\nEmployment and Training Program to learn job skills and to eventually be placed in an\non-campus job. Residents also participate in off-campus activities such as swimming,\ncommunity activities and events, and shopping.\nIn addition to a parent support group meeting at the facility, the program focuses on\ncoaching parents in the child’s home to build skills that expand the parents’ repertoire of\nbehavioral intervention techniques and assist the parents in implementing a consistent\nBehavior Intervention Plan.\nThe Parramore Home’s policies and procedures have been in effect for nearly two years\nand will be utilized by both West Campus living units. Residents attend various public\nschools with services specific to their impairment being provided. Lighthouse School is\nalso developing a specialized on-campus educational program to meet the educational\nneeds of residents who would be better served without traveling to an off-campus\nschool.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe Kentwood Campus Renewal was completed on 02/15/2013. Parramore Home’s\nresident files and staff files were audited as a part of that process. Interviews of staff\nand verbal residents were conducted as a part of that license renewal. The Parramore\nHome will become a part of the West Campus on 3/1/2013. Additionally, the new\nemployee files of eight staff hired to supervise and care for VanderArk Home residents\non the West Campus were reviewed. Verbal residents of the Parramore Home were\ninterviewed and expressed satisfaction with their care and the staff providing it. They\nreported good meals and sufficient clothing. They also reported a variety of activities\n3",
    "and one resident reported a pending interview for the Employment and Training\nProgram, where he will be employed and earn a weekly paycheck. That resident\ndemonstrated social skills and cleaning skills that he had recently learned.\nThe West Campus is in compliance with all licensing rules and statutes.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that a license be issued to this child caring institution, effective\n3/1/2013.\n02/15/2013\nSteve Ragsdale Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/19/2013\nGregory V. Corrigan Date\nArea Manager\n4"
