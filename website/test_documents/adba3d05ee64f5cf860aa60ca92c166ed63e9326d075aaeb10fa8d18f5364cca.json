    "Rule Code Application submission.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12308\nSection (1) An agency shall act on a completed and signed application.\nDescription\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not act on the family's application which was\nsubmitted on 5/15/2023. The agency did not enroll the family with\nDCWL until 12/5/2023 and the 3130 is still not completed.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nDirector 1\nI spoke with Director 1 about the allegations on 2/2/2024 by\ntelephone. Director 1 reported this matter was first brought to her\nattention by DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services)\non 1/31/2024. She reported upon obtaining information from their\nagency’s licensing staff, she emailed the following response to\nDHHS related to the family’s concern, which was provided to her\nfrom the agency’s licensing supervisor:\n“The report was resubmitted, and I (Licensing Supervisor) emailed\nour consultant so she can be sure to look for it.\nThe issue with the family is:\nFamily signed the application in April of 2023. They did not decide\nto continue with the licensing process until the end of June, as\nthey are not interested in fostering. The main issue was waiting on\nthem to provide a signed copy of the application. The application\nthey submitted had their names printed on the application, but no\nsignature. I didn’t get the actual signed copy until\nNovember/December, and their report was completed in January.”\nDirector 1 reported Licensing Worker (LW) 3, who was assigned\nto complete Applicant A’s and Applicant B’s license left the agency\nand did not do the required work. Licensing Supervisor (LS) 2\nwas supposed to pick up where LW 3 left off and complete the\nfamily’s licensure. Director 1 was not sure why LS 2 had not. LS 2\nhad reported completing the needed tasks/the family’s initial\nlicensing evaluation report in December 2023, but had to re-\nsubmit it.\n2",
    "I advised Director 1 the Child Welfare Licensing Module (CWLM)\nshows Applicant A’s and Applicant B’s licensing home evaluation\nreport was not showing as resubmitted. Additionally, CWLM\nshows all social work contacts related to the family/work on the\nlicense as entered on 1/31/2024. Additionally, the social work\ncontact shows there was an issue or delay with the applicants’\nfingerprints. Given, the latter, I asked Director 1 why it would have\ntaken so long for the agency to alert Applicant A and Applicant B\nof specific delay issues. Director 1 reported no knowledge of a\nfingerprint issue. LS 2 did not report a delay in that area. Director\n1 reported only knowing that there was an issue with the\napplicants’ signatures on the application.\nApplicant A & Applicant B\nOn 2/3/2024 I interviewed Applicant A and her husband, Applicant\nB by telephone. I had a follow up interview with Applicant A by\ntelephone on 2/9/2024. The applicants reported attending a foster\nhome licensing orientation via Zoom with the agency on 4/26/2024\nand submitting an application on 5/15/2023. They recalled LW 3\ncoming out to their home two or three-times, perhaps in May, June\nand August of 2023. During the first visit they gave LW 3 their\npaper work and LW 3 completed a tour of their house. LW 3\npointed out an issue with their steps/stairs, a light and exposed\nwiring, and told them they needed to correct those things. LW 3\ncame to their home in August 2023, and they had completed the\nhome repair matters LW 3 had pointed out to them from their\nearlier home visit. LW 3 gave them new paper work to complete, a\nlarge questionnaire. Applicant A said due to the size/volume of\nthat paper work, she ended up dropping it off at the agency.\nApplicant A also dropped it off because LW 3 was not answering\ntheir phone calls, coming to pick the package up, or responding to\ntheir messages inquiring about the status of their license.\nBecause of those things, they felt LW 3 was not doing her job.\nApplicant A reported on or about 10/15/2023, LW 3 said LW 3 was\nwriting up their licensing study report. In November of 2023, they\ncontacted Licensing Supervisor (LS )2. LS 2 told them LW 3 left\nthe agency and LS 2 would now handle the licensing of their\nhome. LS 2 advised to give her two weeks to examine everything.\nApplicant A called LS 2 again in December 2023 and LS 2\nreported LS 2 was “reviewing the report to be sure it was all right”\nbefore sending it to Lansing. Applicant A was not sure what LS 2\nmeant by making “sure it was all right”. She telephoned LS 2\napproximately two weeks later, in January 2023 and LS 2 gave\nthe impression the report was sent to Lansing. LS 2 said the\nperson in Lansing who reviews the report and processes the\n3",
    "license had been out of the office so, LS 2 was going to follow up\nwith that person via email.\nApplicant A and Applicant B reported their last contact with the\nagency was on 1/23/2024 and they are still waiting to be licensed.\nThey reported going for their fingerprints in July 2023; and denied\nany knowledge of there being an issue related to their finger\nprints. LW 3, never phoned or texted them about a problem with\ntheir finger prints. Other than LS 2 reporting that the fingerprint\nresult may not have come back yet, LS 2 did not report a problem\nwith those documents either. Nor did either agency staff report\nthat a matter with their fingerprints were delaying their licensure.\nApplicant A admitted she and Applicant B are seeking to adopt\nbut she denied them ever procrastinating about moving forward\nwith licensure. She said the agency explained it might be easier to\nadopt by going the foster care route. She reported with regards to\ntheir licensing application, there were two applications. The first\none they received via email after their orientation with another\nworker, Licensing Worker (LW) 4. With that one the agency had\ntyped in their names on the application; and asked them to sign\nand return it. Applicant A said they scanned it and sent it back via\nemail. The other one was in October 2023, whereby LW 3\ncontacted her indicating she needed them to submit another\napplication. Applicant A asked LW 3 whether to sign the\napplication for the date in October 2023. LW 3 told them, no, to\ndate it for the original date of 4/26/2023, which they did. Applicant\nA said LW 3, nor any other agency person communicated to them\nthe significance of their actual signature not being on the\napplication, or that a lack of it was delaying their licensure process\nor progress. They were only told that their paperwork got\noverlooked. Applicant A said she and Applicant B did everything\nthe agency asked of them promptly; and had the agency advised\nthem that their signature on the application was an issue they\nwould have handled that quickly also.\nLicensing Supervisor 2\nOn 2/5/2024 I interviewed Licensing Supervisor (LS) 2 by\ntelephone. I received email information from her on 2/12/2024.\nLS 2 affirmed Director 1’s reporting that LW 3 was assigned to\ncomplete Applicant A’s and Applicant B’s licensure. LS 2 reported\nthere ended up being a problem with Applicant A’s and Applicant\nB’s application. The applicants did not actually sign the\napplication. She said LW 3 reported Applicant A and Applicant B\nwanted to adopt, and they were procrastinating about becoming\n4",
    "licensed. LW 3 kept going back and trying to get Applicant A’s\nand Applicant B’s signature on the application. On one occasion\nin July or August LW 3 made a home visit with the family but\nforgot to get the application signed. Thereon, LS 2 was advising\nLW 3 to obtain the signatures. LS 2 was not sure why that never\noccurred until much later.\nLS 2 reported since Applicant A and Applicant B had not signed\nthe licensing application, the agency did not enroll the family with\nDCWL until much later than the May 2023 application receipt date.\nShe affirmed Applicant A’s and Applicant B’s reporting as to when\nthe couple went for their fingerprint scans. The couple returned\nthose documents to the agency on 8/15/2023. The fingerprints\nwere not processed until the agency received the family’s actual\nsigned application.\nLS 2 reported when LW 3 left the agency on 12/1/2023, LW 3 had\ncompleted the family’s licensing evaluation report on a template.\nLS 2 cut and pasted information from that template into CWLM.\nAdditionally, she and another worker, LW 4 entered all the social\nwork contacts into CWLM. I also advised LS 2 that CWLM shows\nall the social work contacts as entered on 1/31/2024. LS 2\nreported that on 1/18/2024 she had cut and pasted the information\nin CWLM and submitted the report, but apparently most of the\ninformation didn’t save. LS 2 was not sure why the information\nhad not saved. She re-did it and also had LW 4 complete some\ninformation again then they submitted the report to DCWL.\nLS 2 denied reporting to the family the licensing report was\nsubmitted in November 2023. She admitted it was very possible\nthat LW 3 did not explain to the family the need for or importance\nof the signatures on the application that not having the signatures\non the application prevented the agency from moving on the\napplication. LS 2 was not sure why the agency/LW 3 had not told\nthe family the agency could not accept the application until the\napplication was signed.\nLS 2 reported the questionnaire the family was given to complete\nis a document that is not required for the family to complete. The\nquestionnaire is a tool which workers are supposed to use as a\nguide to complete the interviews with families. LS 2 admitted\nworkers were never told to not give the questionnaire to families\neither. That will be made clear to workers moving forward.\nDocument review:\nCWLM case file for Applicant A and Applicant B which showed:\n5",
    "• The applicants attended orientation on 4/26/2023 and an\napplication was provided.\n• An application dated 4/26/2023 signed by Applicant A and\nApplication B and indication the application was received\non 5/15/2023.\n• The family was enrolled with DCWL on 12/5/2023.\n• A social work contact of a 5/30/2023 telephone call to the\nfamily to schedule a home visit for licensure and indication\nthat the applicants wanted to wait because they really only\nwanted to adopt. Also, a subsequent telephone call from\nthe family on 6/30/2023 indicated they wish to proceed with\nthe licensing process and subsequent home visits with the\nfamily on 7/1/2023 and 8/15/2023.\n• Social work contacts indicating contact made to the family\nabout the application:\n➢ 5/8/2023 a telephone call was made to the family\nabout the application not being signed, just having\nthe applicants’ name printed on it.\n➢ 6/1/2023 email sent to show the family the\napplication was not signed.\n➢ 8/15/2023 home visit with family, LW3 was to get\nthe application signed and forgot.\n➢ 8/16/ 2023 and 8/22/2023 phone call about the\napplication signature.\n➢ 9/15/2023 a text message was sent to applicant\nabout the application needing signatures and finger\nprint not processed.\n➢ No social work contact showing the worker\nexplained the significance of the need for the actual\nsignature on the application and why the licensing\nprocess and procedure could not proceed.\n• Documentation the supervisor received the signed\napplication on 12/1/2023.\n• A social work contact on 12/15/2023 that Applicant A was\nprovided an update on the licensing report, that the\nprevious licensing worker is no longer with the agency and\nthe supervisor is completing the report.\n• A 1/18/2024 social work contact that the family was\ninformed the licensing report was completed by the\nlicensing supervisor and the decision about licensure will\nbe made by DCWL.\n• The applicants’ foster home initial evaluation/reevaluation\nreport (CWL 3130) was submitted to DCWL on 2/20/2024.\n• A final 3130 report for the applicants dated 2/22/2024 that\nindicated it was completed by LW 4 and approved by LS 2.\n6",
    "• The family was issued a foster home license on 2/22/2024.\nAnalysis The agency accepted an unsigned application; and failed to\ntimely secure the family’s signed application and enroll the\napplicants with DCWL. Therein the agency delayed the applicants’\napplication proceedings and licensure.\nConclusion Violation Established.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\nApril 1, 2024\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 11, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n7"
