Youth A was redirected to\nstop moving and pulling on his thumbs. Youth A laughed in\nresponse and stated his thumbs do not hurt. Youth A stated he\nwas taken to the hospital after this physical management for\nsuicidal ideation and his left hand was also evaluated. Youth A\nstated the hospital told him that his left thumb was dislocated and\nhe needed to see a doctor.

Staff 1 does not have discipline history for\nimproper restraint.\nSupervisor 1 completed Crisis Prevention Institute physical\nmanagement training on 02/20/2025.

It is unknown when or how\nYouth A dislocated his left thumb because Youth A believes his\nleft thumb is double jointed and does not experience pain in his\nleft thumb.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV.
