INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(b) The services provided to residents and parents directly by\nthe institution and the services provided by outside resources.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A has not received weekly individual therapy since 7/12/22.\nInvestigation I notified the Complainant, who is also DHHS Supervisor, that\nDCWL was assigned this complaint. Complainant indicated she\nreceived the allegation second-hand from one of Youth A’s\nworkers. I notified the Foster Care and Juvenile Justice workers\nof the investigation assignment and neither expressed additional\nconcerns.\nI notified Chief Administrator and Director of the allegation.\nI reviewed Youth A’s clinical case notes from 7/12/22 – 3/8/23\nauthored by Therapist and entered in MISACWIS. Documentation\nindicates Youth A was seen for individual therapy 36 times in 36\nweeks. During weeks 9/26/22 and 1/31/23, Therapist was out of\nthe office but held double sessions the following week. It should\nbe noted that Complainant, Foster Care and Juvenile Justice\nworker all presumably have access to the clinical case notes in\nMISACWIS.\nI interviewed Youth A on 3/16/23. He is a MDHHS dual ward who\nhas resided at the facility since 7/12/22. Asked about the\n2",
    "allegation, Youth A denied telling anyone he is not receiving\nweekly individual therapy. Rather, he corrected, “I’m not getting\nthe right (type of) therapy.” After some discussion, it became\nevident that Youth A dislikes treatment work that focuses on his\ncurrent negative behaviors. Conversely, he feels treatment is\nappropriate when it focuses on his past and the specific charge(s)\nthat brought him to Lincoln Center. Further, Youth A claimed his\njudge ordered the type of therapy the youth values and “did not”\norder the type he finds useless. Specifically, Youth A does not\nsee the value of working on current behaviors or how his present\nrelates to his past. Essentially, he feels that addressing his\ncurrent behaviors prolongs his ability to complete the program and\nget released.\nI interviewed Youth B’s Therapist. She said she has regular\ncontact with Youth B’s Foster Care and Juvenile Justice Workers\nand neither expressed concerns that she is not doing the\nappropriate amount or type of therapy. I recommended Therapist\nreach out to the workers and provide an extensive explanation of\nthe therapy model as it is one that is widely used by clinicians who\nwork with juvenile justice youth.\nAnalysis Lincoln Center’s program statement and contract indicates each\nyouth in residential treatment receives weekly individual therapy\nby a Clinical Case Manager (Therapist). Youth A is receiving the\ntype and amount of individual therapy identified in the program\nstatement.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMarch 17, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 27, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
