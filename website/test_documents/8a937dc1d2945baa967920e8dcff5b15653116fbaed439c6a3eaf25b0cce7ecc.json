    "ALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that two residents were able to engage in sexual activity on three\nseparate occasions. Resident were not properly supervised on these\noccasions.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed the Recipient Rights Officer (RRO) and he reported that he was made\naware of the allegations on Saturday, May 9, 2020 and he spoke to the two\nresidents regarding the allegation. He said the two residents admitted they engaged\nin sexual activities on three occasions. He said neither resident could recall what\nstaff was assigned at the time of the incident but was able to recall that the acts\noccurred on the afternoon shift. He said the two residents admitted that the three\nsexual acts were planned. He said the two residents said they were in the bathroom\ntogether without staff supervision. He said he later received information that one of\nthe residents recalled Staff 1 and Staff 2 were on the wing while the interactions\noccurred in the showers. The RRO reported he received information from Resident\nA’s therapist that she did not want to get Resident B in trouble but that she was\nsaying no to Resident B initially before being peer pressured into the acts with\nverbally demeaning statements and name calling if she did not perform the acts. He\nreported that Resident A did not report this information to him when he asked her if\nshe had been forced or convinced to engage in the acts.\nI interviewed Resident A, age 17, and she said she performed oral sex on Resident\nB when staff was not paying attention on three different times on three different\ndays. She said on two different days she went in the shower and Resident B was in\nthe shower and got in the shower with her and the sexual acts occurred. She said\non one occasion she went into Resident B’s bedroom when staff was not in the area\nand performed oral sex on Resident B. Resident A said she did these acts because\nshe wanted to and not because she was forced. She identified Staff 1 and Staff 2 as\nthe two staff that worked on all three shifts when these acts occurred. She said she\nstopped because resident B told staff on her.\nI interviewed Resident B, age 17, and her story was slightly different from Resident\nA’s. She reported she was in the shower and Resident B came into the shower and\nsaid she was in the bathroom. She said Resident A got into the shower with her and\nthat Resident A performed oral sex on her. She said it lasted a good ten minutes.\nShe said she did not feel forced into letting Resident A do this to her. Resident B\nalleges that the act occurred twice in one day. She said she left out of the bathroom\nafter the first sexual act and re-enter the bathroom a second time and Resident A\ncommitted the act with her a second time. Resident B said the act occurred the third\ntime in Resident A’s bedroom. Resident B said the first time Resident A asked she\n3",
    "said no but that Resident A kept begging her and she gave in. Resident B said she\ndid not know what staff was working the shifts during those times.\nBoth Residents reported they were separated on different area of the building and\nthat they were no longer friends. Both residents reported they felt safe at Vista\nMaria.\nI interviewed Staff 1 who works the afternoon shift. She reported she has been\nworking for Vista Maria (VM) since July 2019. She said she did not know anything\nabout a sexual act between Resident A and Resident B. She said the residents are\nmonitored all the times. She said the residents go to the bathroom one at a time.\nShe said if two residents are in the bathroom, she usually sits in the bathroom with\nthe residents and this is also the procedure used when the residents are taking\nshowers.\nI interviewed Staff 2. He said he has been working for VM for fifteen years. He\ndenied that he observed or saw anything regarding the allegation. He said the\nresidents are in “line of sight “at all times and this was common practice. He said\nthere are two staff on the wing at all times.\n.\nThe building ratio is two staff per seven residents (2:7).\nA police report was file regarding the allegation. The Log number is 20-5837.\nDearborn Police Department came out to the facility and took a report from both\nresidents regarding the allegation. Both residents reported they were not forced to\ndo these sexual acts and that it was consensual.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: There were no incident reports written because staff denied they\nwitness these sexual acts between Residents A and B. There\nwere no video tapes reviewed because VM does not have video\nrecording in Donna Maria Hall, and showers would not be video\nrecordings in the shower.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 reported they are monitoring the residents at\nall times and that the residents are in “line of sight.”\nResident A and B both reported they engaged in sexual acts\n(oral) on three different occasions, twice in the bathroom shower\nand once in Resident A’s bedroom. Resident A said the sexual\nactivity stopped because Resident B told on her.\nA police report was file regarding the allegation. The Log\nnumber is 20-5837. Dearborn Police Department came out to\nthe facility and interviewed both residents regarding the\nallegation. Both residents reported they were not forced to do\nthis sexual act and that it was consensual.\nThe residents could not provide the exact dates the sexual acts\noccurred but was adamant that the three sexual acts occurred\non the afternoon shift. Based on the residents’ interviews, it is\nestablished that staff did not provide the continual supervision of\nthe residents.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend Vista Maria Specialty Residential - Donna Maria Hall license remain\nunchanged upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan.\n07/02/2020\n______________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 2, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5",
