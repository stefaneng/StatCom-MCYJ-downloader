All the following apply: (ii) A copy of a\nwaiver addressed to the department that is signed by\nthe parent stating immunizations are not being\nadministered due to religious, medical, or other\nreasons is sufficient documentation of immunizations,\nunless the child is a temporary court ward, a motion is\nheard, and order is entered by the circuit court for the\nchild's case. A waiver must be accompanied by a\ncertification by the local health department that the\nparent or parents received education on the risks of not\nreceiving the vaccines being waived and the benefits of\nvaccination to the individual and the community as\nrequired by section 5111 of the public health code,\n1978 PA 368, MCL 333.5111, and R 325.176(12).\nThree of six foster care files had one missing immunization each.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n9/27/23 Renewal, CAP approved 10/12/23.",
    "CPA Rule 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy\n(2) An agency shall maintain a file documentation from\nthe medical or dental provider of all medical and dental\ncare received by a foster child.\nOne of six foster care files did not have documentation of an annual well-child\nexam.\nCPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n(5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents\nand the foster parents in the development of service\nplans to enable the parent or parents and foster\nparents to understand the plan for the child and the\nparents' and the foster parent's role in assisting the\nagency in carrying out the plan. An agency shall give a\ncopy to and review the parent-agency treatment plan\n(PATP) with the parent or parents and foster parents.\nThe agency must inform the parent or parents and\nfoster parent that the information in the parent-agency\ntreatment plan and any other information about the\nchild and the child's family is confidential.\nThree of six foster care cases held PATPs that were not signed to indicate a copy\nwas provide to or reviewed with the parent or foster parent/relative caregiver.\nCPA Rule 400.12422 Foster care case record\n(3) The record must contain all the following\ninformation: (g) A photograph taken at least annually.\nTwo of six foster care files did not have a current photo of the youth uploaded to\nMiSACWIS.\nCPA Rule 400.12422 Foster care case record\n(2) An agency shall protect each record against\ndestruction and damage and store and maintain each\nchild's record in a manner to ensure confidentiality and\nto prevent unauthorized access.\nDuring a walkthrough of the agency it was observed that foster care files were not\nstored securely. Case files were stored on open shelves at the case manager’s\ndesks.",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Immunizations: The agency was advised that if a foster parent does not take\nappropriate actions for youth to receive immunizations, a special evaluation\nshould be initiated. If a relative caregiver does not take appropriate actions,\nefforts must be documented, and the case worker should schedule an\nappointment for immunizations. If the youth’s physician determines there are\nmore urgent medical needs and the immunizations should be postponed, the\nagency must have documentation in the file to indicate a plan for immunizations.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request or require consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment In Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period in response to the 2024 Inspection, and compliance with each\nindividual CAP is as follows: The agency reported implementing the CAP through\nutilization of a new hire/intern checklist and increased oversight through the book\nof business for due dates related to foster care and Independent Living. The CAP\nappears to have been effective as there were no repeat violations from 2024\nduring this review. There was one repeat violation regarding immunizations from\n2023 which will be addressed in a new CAP.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) Annual Assessment dated 9/11/25 was reviewed\nand discussed. The Chief Administrator reported the 2024 CAP had been\nimplemented to address areas of non-compliance with personnel files, service\nplans, and placement change. The CA did not identify any systemic barriers.\nHowever, they did report that inconsistent use of the book of business may have\nbeen the cause of the violations. The agency implemented strategies to prevent\nfurther repeat violations. The CA reported key performance indicators from\nAugust 2025 show high compliance in most areas. The CA reported ten placement\ndisruptions during this review period. The main reason for disrupted placements\nwas youth needing a higher level of care than what was available in their",
    "placement and hospital stabilization was needed. The CA reported that nine of the\nplacement disruptions were youth placed in residential, who needed\nhospitalization for stabilization, then returned to the residential treatment program.\nThe tenth youth was in a court ordered placement, in which the provider struggled\nto meet their needs for safe boundaries and structure. Once the youth moved to a\nplacement with a higher level of care, stability occurred.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. Both staff reported they enjoy their position\nand feel the workload is manageable. Both staff stated their supervisors are\nsupportive, understand the work, and they are easy to talk with. Staff reported that\nthe whole office works well together, supports one another, and communicates\nwell. Staff stated they were happy with the organization as a whole and did not\nhave any concerns, or suggestions for improvement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2024 review. The\nbuilding had sufficient space for staff and clients to meet and hold visitation. The\nagency did not have locking file storage, as reflected in the violation of rule\n400.12422 (2). The agency reported they have ordered shelves to be placed in a\nlocking room, as a solution for this violation.\nVII. AGENCY ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two identified safety alerts:\nSafety Alert #1: On 7/17/25 the Agency Analyst observed a home did not have a\ncarbon monoxide detector. The home also did not have a smoke detector in the\nbasement.\nResolution #1: The caregiver and agency worked together to obtain a smoke alarm\nand carbon monoxide detector. These were installed on 7/21/25. Photos were\nprovided to DCWL as verification.\nSafety Alert #2: On 8/27/25 a safety alert was issued as the caregivers did not\nrespond to multiple requests from the Agency Analyst to schedule a visit.\nResolution #2: The agency initiated a special evaluation. A home visit was\nconducted by the agency on 8/27/25. No safety concerns were noted. The family\nreportedly failed to schedule with the analyst due to their busy schedule and not\nprioritizing the visit.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.",
