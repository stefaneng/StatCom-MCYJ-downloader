Renewal\nInspection dated 4/8/2022, CAP accepted 4/18/2022 was in violation with Rules\n400.12418 (2,a) and 400.12418 (2,b) Development of service plans, 400.12510 (2)\nIndependent living contract, 400.12511 Termination, and policy/contract, ISEP\n4.22 MiSACWIS, FOM DHHS Policy 722.08D. The agency has worked really well\nwith their CAP as for this reporting period, they only have one repeat violation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed in the entrance\nconference. The Chief Administrator identified areas of non-compliance involving\ntimely completion of documentation due to worker/supervisor changes.

There is no\nsmoke detector located in the basement or properly placed near the bedroom that is\ndesignated for the ten-year-old youth bedroom. Resolution: Caseworker visited the\nhome and verified the smoke detector in the upstairs area was working but the one\nin the basement was not due to needing a battery. A battery was put in the smoke\ndetector while the worker was onsite. A conversation was held with the caregiver on\n3/27/23 about the safety of the bed in the basement and not having an egress\nwindow. The caregiver agreed to dismantle the bed and store the mattresses.\nPhotos were taken of the dismantle bed and the removal of the mattresses. The\nphotos are uploaded in CWLM with this safety alert.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n6/27/2023\n________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6/28/23\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
