He\nremarked that Youth A was placed at the facility on 06/27/2024\nand had already had pods moved to try to separate him from other\nyouth that appeared to be escalating easily with him. Program\nDirector also recalled directly speaking with Youth A within the last\nweek and that Youth A did not express to him that he felt unsafe\nor that he felt staff were not working to ensure his safety.\nThe Foster Care Worker for Youth A was interviewed over email\non 07/24/2024.

He also brought up an incident\nfrom the day prior where staff were sitting outside of Youth A’s\nroom because there was a concern about other youth in the pod\nattempting to escalate situations with Youth A. Youth A refused to\nidentify the other youth and could not name the staff involved. He\nstated there had not been any situations where he had felt unsafe\nsince being placed at the facility, and felt the times that he had\nbeen moved pods was done so with his safety in mind. Youth A\nalso commented that every day staff provided consequences to\nyouth, including himself at times, within the facility’s\nprogramming. Youth A remarked the consequences were\nconsistently provided, but he did not think that those were ever\ngoing to be enough to stop any youth from doing what they\nwanted to do.\nYouth B was interviewed on 08/05/2024 during an unannounced\nvisit to the facility. He believed that consequences for youth not\nfollowing facility rules were consistently applied and that had to\noccur often because of a significant amount of negative behavior\nfrom other youth in the program.

Staff 3 recalled many instances when Youth A would\nexperience escalated behavior directed towards other youth, or\nother youth directing the same at him. Staff 3 reported no\nconcerns that this had ever occurred without proper staff\nintervention.\nAttempts were made to speak with Staff 4 on 02/05/2025 and\n02/07/2025 with no success.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Four incident reports regarding Youth A dated 07/14/2024,\n07/25/2024 and two on 07/29/2024 were reviewed.

She stated she was aware that staff were taking\npaperwork, such as suicide watch forms, home to fill out and had\nbeen informed to do so by Supervisor 2. No other information on\nhow this was known, or any other details were able to be\nprovided.\nThe Program Director was interviewed on 07/17/2024 during an\nunannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He stated no staff\nmembers had brought any concerns to his attention that any\ndocumentation for the program had been taken out of the building\nto be completed. The Program Director believed this was unlikely\nbecause of how documentation was organized within the control\nrooms of the pods and a general, unwritten practice that staff do\nnot carry any paperwork around while moving throughout the\n4",
    "facility to protect confidentiality and to reduce the risk of\nmisplacing it.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed on 08/05/2024 during an\nunannounced visit to the facility. She stated she had no concerns\nabout documentation being taken offsite largely because much of\nwhat staff and supervisors were required to complete was done on\ncomputers. She stated that no one had ever brought it to her\nattention this was allegedly occurring.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed over the phone on\n11/19/2024. She stated she has never had a concern or heard\nanything about staff possibly taking paperwork outside of the\nbuilding. She referred to the required documentation that was\nneeded at times, such as overnight watch logs, incident reports,\nand suicide watch documentation, as simple to complete in their\nnature and that staff normally completed those items before the\nend of their shifts as is the normal practice for the facility. She\nalso stated that it was common place for staff to ask for help if a\ndocumentation task was not being completed. Supervisor 1\nstated there were times that a document might not be completed\ntimely, but that situation would mean it was not taken outside of\nthe building to be completed. Supervisor 1 was not sure how her\nname may have been mentioned as someone who was aware of\nthis allegation.\nAttempts to interview Staff 1 were made on 10/17/2024 and\n11/19/2024 with no return contact.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• New Employee Orientation documentation for Staff 1 was\nprovided and reviewed. This contained confirmation that\nEmployee Ethics policy had been reviewed with Staff 1 at\nthe time of hire.\n• Facility Employee Ethics Policy last dated 12/15/2020 was\nprovided and reviewed. This policy outlined standards of\nconduct, including the requirement that staff “shall ensure\nthe confidentiality of consumers and employees is not\ninappropriately disclosed.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per staff interviews and\ndocumentation reviewed. There was no evidence found that staff\nhave taken documentation out of the building.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
    "Rule Code Program statement.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff have falsified records regarding supervision of youth by filling\nout documentation ahead of time.\nInvestigation The Complainant was interviewed over the phone on\n09/04/2024. No other information on how the information in the\nallegations was known was able to be provided other than the\ninclusion of Staff 2 as another individual who knew about the\npractice of filling out paperwork in advance.\nThe Program Director was interviewed on 07/17/2024 during an\nunannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. The Program\nDirector advised that the “pink sheets” referred to in the allegation\nwere documentation that was performed to capture eyes-on\nefforts for youth who had concerns of suicidal ideation. The\nProgram Director was not aware of any concern that staff had\nallegedly filled out the documentation in advance and stated that\nno staff members had brought this to his attention.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed on 08/05/2024 during an\nunannounced visit to the facility. She stated she had never had a\nconcern that staff would have been filling out any paperwork in\nadvance of anything occurring. She believed that any\ndocumentation regarding timed tasks, such as eyes on checks of\nyouth, would show details such as correct varied times and\nsometimes show that multiple staff completed the tasks as the\nnight went on.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed over the phone on\n11/19/2024. She stated that she had never had concern nor was\nit ever brought to her attention that documentation was being filled\nout in advance of when it was needed. Part of why Supervisor 1\n6",
    "stated this was because of her own responsibilities that she\ndescribed, working on third shift at times and walking through\neach pod every hour to sign off on the documentation being\ncompleted by third shift staff.\nAn attempt was made to interview Staff 2 over the phone on\n11/19/2024 and no contact was made.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• New Employee Orientation documentation for Supervisor 1\nwas provided and reviewed. This contained confirmation\nthat Employee Ethics policy had been reviewed with\nSupervisor 1 at the time of hire.\n• Facility Employee Ethics Policy last dated 12/15/2020 was\nprovided and reviewed.

This documentation showed staff\nefforts of staff to monitor youth who were considered a\nconcern for self harm or had expressed suicidal\nideation. No concerns were noted on this documentation.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as staff interviews and\ndocumentation reviewed. There was no evidence found that any\ndocumentation was being filled out in advance of the need for its\ncompletion.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Program statement.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\n7",
    "Allegation Room searches are required by facility policy but have not been\ncompleted properly.\nInvestigation The Complainant was interviewed over the phone on\n09/04/2024. She remarked she was unsure of this allegation\nbeing reported because she had never heard of a lack of room\nsearch practices at the facility. The Complainant stated she was\naware of youth who had contraband or unsafe items from inside\nthe facility found inside of their rooms and stated this only\noccurred because room searches were conducted as needed.\nThe Program Director was interviewed on 07/17/2024 during an\nunannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He remarked that\nroom searches being conducted because of the concern that\ncontraband or unsafe items were located inside of them were not\nperformed frequently. The Program Director clarified that these\nwere infrequent events not because they were not being\nperformed but because there was rare concern that youth had\ncontraband within the facility.\nYouth A was interviewed on 07/30/2024 during an unannounced\nvisit to the facility. He recalled seeing and hearing about other\nyouth’s rooms being searched on occasion and did not express\nconcern that this was not occurring as would be needed to ensure\nsafety.\nYouth B and Youth C were interviewed separately on 08/05/2024\nduring an unannounced visit to the facility. They both stated that\nroom searches happened on occasion and neither expressed\nconcern that they had not been completed as necessary.\nThe facility’s Licensee Designee was interviewed over the phone\non 01/24/2025. He reported rare occurrences of room searches at\nthe facility over the past year. He believed that this was due to\ngood practices to search youth upon entrance in the facility, as\nwell as the elimination of items within the facility that could present\nsafety precautions. He reported that documentation of room\nsearches would not exist in separate documentation on it’s own,\nbut would be contained within incident reports related to other\nreasons for the documentation.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n• The facility confirmed on 01/27/2025 that they do not have\nwritten policy regarding room searches.\n8",
    "• As of 01/29/2025 the facility could not produce any incident\nreports back to the date of the receipt of these allegations\nthat contained staff activity of room searches.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed. There was no evidence\nfound that room searches were not being completed as\nnecessary.\nTechnical Assistance\nIf the agency has expectations for staff to complete room checks,\nthen a written policy pertaining to room searches should be\ndeveloped.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n01/31/2025\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/10/2025\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n9"
