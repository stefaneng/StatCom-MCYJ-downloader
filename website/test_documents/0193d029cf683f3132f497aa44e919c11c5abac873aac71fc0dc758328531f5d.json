The incident\nreport suggested Youth A was restrained because he punched a computer monitor.\nThe Incident Report was dated 9/19/21. It stated Youth A was in a high state of\nanxiety. He was frustrated about an Incident Report that was written when he\n2",
    "assaulted his peer last week. Staff tried to have a discussion with him about the\nreport but he became defensive. Youth A then went to the office and demanded to\nsee his Incident Report. Staff told him he could not see it. He was still anxious and\nasked to go outside. Staff asked him to de-escalate in his room for a few minutes\ndue to it being shift change. Youth A continued to demand to see his report. He was\ndirected to go to his room then became “irate” and punched the computer screen.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 attempted to put Youth A in a Team Control Restraint. Youth A\nand the staff slipped on water that was on the floor. Due to how they all went to the\nfloor Youth A ended up on top of Staff 1 and began to punch staff. Staff physically\nmanaged Youth A’s arms while on the ground. After a minute staff disengaged.\nYouth A was given some space. He walked in and out of the house and eventually\nended up punching and breaking a window. He was then placed in another restraint.\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) was contacted via telephone on 9/21/21 and asked\nabout the incident. He stated he thought Youth A was restrained due to him hitting\nthe computer. Since it was not clear if the restraint was initiated due to property\ndestruction or another reason the CA was told an investigation would need to be\ncompleted.\nYouth A’s case file documentation was reviewed. He was placed at the facility\nthrough the court. He has a calming plan that indicates he gets upset when people\nyell at him, repeat directions to him, and talk to him in a disrespectful tone. Some\nthings that help him are music, coloring and thinking by himself. A behavior plan was\nput in place after this incident. It indicated Youth A argues with staff to a point where\nhe is unable to stop or back down from a confrontation. To help him address this\nbehavior he will ask for space alone in his room, refocus for five minutes, and/or find\na work session. His treatment plan indicates he has done well at the facility, but he is\neasily frustrated and at times struggles to manage his emotions. He does have a\nhistory of aggression and violence.\nYouth A was interviewed at the facility on 9/23/21. He stated that things were good\nat the facility and that he has his ups and downs. He reported on Sunday he hit the\ncomputer then broke a window. He broke the computer screen when he hit it. He\nresisted staff and ended up hitting his head on the door. He stated he was mad due\nto a critical that he received. The staff present were Staff 1 and Staff 2. He could not\nremember how he ended up on the floor. He said he could not remember much of\nanything. When he was on the ground, he picked something up to hit staff with. Him\nand the staff were on the ground wrestling and other staff came over. Youth A stated\nhe was being a jerk when he hit the computer. He does not like people touching him\nand he felt like he was being attacked and needed to fight back.\nStaff 1 was interviewed at the facility on 9/23/21. He reported Youth A was anxious\nall day. Staff 1 continuously tried to talk him down. Youth A was asking about his\ncritical and was having a hard time accepting responsibility for why he received the\ncritical. At shift change he was supposed to be in his room, but he came to the office\ndoor. Youth A had seen the critical the previous night and wanted to see it again. He\n3",
    "then asked to go outside. Staff 1 stated he was trying to get Youth A to de-escalate\nwithout going outside. Youth A then hit the computer screen. Staff 1 immediately\nwent to hold Youth A. Not to restrain him but to calm him down. Youth A then fought\nStaff 1 and tried to hit him. They fell to the floor due to water being on the floor\nmaking it slippery. They were on the floor less than a minute. Youth A then got up\nand walked toward the door. Staff 1 stated he tried to stop Youth A from hitting the\ncomputer because he has seen Youth A try to hurt himself before, so he was trying\nto prevent Youth A from being injured. Youth A did hurt his hand either from hitting\nthe computer or when he hit the window later. Staff 1 again said he was not planning\nto restrain Youth A but to get him to stop and not hurt himself. He stated he was\ntrying to show Youth A care. When asked he stated it was supposed to be more like\na hug to drain off his emotions which is something he has done with Youth A in the\npast. Staff 1 stated he did not think it would have gone the way it did had they not\nslipped to the floor.\nStaff 2 was interviewed at the facility on 9/23/21. She stated Youth A was highly\nanxious. Staff 1 talked to him. Youth A was upset that his home pass was cancelled\ndue to him earning a critical for hitting another kid. Youth A was yelling and cussing\nat the staff. He then punched the computer and knocked items off the desk. Staff 1\nput Youth A in a standing hold. Youth A struggled and they went to the ground when\nthey slipped. She grabbed his legs, but they soon let him up. He was still aggressive.\nYouth A went outside then came back into the house. Emergency procedures were\ncalled because Youth A was still escalated. He then punched the window and was\nplaced in team control in the living room. His hands were injured and wrapped up.\nThey took him to the Emergency Room, but he did not need stitches. Staff 2\nreported once Youth A is escalated there is no calming down. He was restrained for\nsafety reasons to prevent harm to himself and others. Youth A has in the past been\nharmful to himself and others when escalated.\nThe video of the incident was reviewed on 9/30/21 via Zoom due to potential COVID\nexposure on campus. Manager 1 shared his screen. The video took place on\n9/19/21 at 3:12pm. The video has no sound. Youth A is in the doorway to the office.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 are present in the office. Youth A and Staff 2 appear to be having\na conversation. Based on Staff 2's body posture and hand movements she appears\nagitated. Based on Youth A's body posture and hand movements he initially seems\ncalm. Youth A appears to get more agitated as they continue to talk. Staff 2 walks up\nto Youth A then steps back. Youth A swings his fist and knocks over the computer\nscreen. Staff 1 wraps his arms around Youth A from behind him. The two fall to the\nfloor. There is a tussle and Youth A is seen punching staff multiple times. Staff 2\nassists by laying her body on top of Youth A. At one point Staff 1 is observed in a\nsitting position while Youth A is lying face down on top of him and Staff 2 is lying her\nbody on top of Youth A’s body. Staff 1 is able to get away from Youth A. Youth A's\nbody is face down on the floor while Staff 2 is still lying her body on top of him. Staff\n1 is seen securing one of Youth A’s arms. A third staff who was in the doorway takes\nYouth A's legs and pulls them straight so that Youth A's body is lying flat on the floor\nin a prone position. Less than a minute the Staff disengage the hold.\n4",
    "The facility’s Behavior Management Philosophy and Procedures state Physical\nIntervention is used when there is a clear risk of imminent harm to self, to others or\nin the likelihood of significant property damage.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nJRM 610 Youth Restraint\nGeneral Guidance\nPer Emergency CCI Rules 3(1), facility staff may only restrain a\nyouth to prevent serious injury to the youth, self-injury or injury\nto others.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 and Staff 2 reported Youth A was restrained to prevent\nharm to himself or others. The video showed Youth A was highly\nescalated and swung out hitting the computer screen off the\ndesk while Staff 1 was standing in front of Youth A.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe Behavior Management Philosophy and Procedures needs\nto be updated to not include destruction of property as a reason\nfor restraint.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nWhen reviewing the video for the above investigation Staff 2 appears agitated as\nevidenced by her body posture and hand movements. This then escalates Youth A\nand he takes a swing at the computer. During this confrontation both staff remain in\nthe office which is a small space. Youth A stands in the open doorway. When Youth\nA swings at the computer he steps into the office causing him to be restrained in a\ntight spot. At first Staff 1 was under Youth A while Staff 2 laid on top of Youth A then\nStaff 1 was able to get free. Staff 2 continued to lay on top of Youth A while he was\nface down on the floor. A third staff takes Youth A’s legs pulling them out straight so\nthat Youth A’s prone body is flat on the floor. While in the restraint Youth A was\nobserved being restrained in a prone position with Staff 2 lying on top of Youth A.\nManager 1 was asked if this hold is something that is taught by their restraint\ntechnique, and he stated that it appeared that staff were attempting to do the prone\nrestraint that was previously taught but is no longer taught due to the state\nprohibiting prone restraints. He was asked if Staff 2 laying on Youth A was an\napproved by the previous technique and he was stated it was not. He stated it\nlooked like Staff 1 was not trying to complete a restraint but rather was trying to\nmove Youth A.\n5",
    "Documentation from the employee files of Staff 1 and Staff 2 were reviewed. Staff 1\nwas hired on 12/16/20. He completed restraint training on 1/22/21 and supplemental\nholds on 9/16/21. He was counseled for disrespecting a supervisor on 7/15/21.\nStaff 2 was hired on 3/21/18. She completed restraint training on 1/22/21 and\nsupplemental holds on 9/16/21. She received discipline for attendance on 1/29/21.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the minor\nchild’s behavior, chronological and developmental age, size,\ngender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand done in a manner consistent with the resident’s treatment\nplan.\nANALYSIS: Youth A is escalated by staff, restrained in an unsafe location,\nand restrained in prone restraint with Staff 2 lying on top of him.\nThis is not a safe way to perform a restraint also, prone\nrestraints are not allowed in Child Caring Institutions (CCI) due\nto the safety risk they impose.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED (Previously cited under\nEmergency Rule 1 (2)\n2021C0214007, CAP approved on 3/18/21\nIV.

The central allegation that staff performed a restraint due solely to property destruction was not substantiated, as the investigator concluded the restraint was initiated to prevent imminent harm. However, the investigation revealed significant additional violations: staff escalated the situation through agitated behavior, conducted the restraint in an unsafe location, and used a prohibited prone restraint technique with a staff member lying on top of the youth. Overall, the facility and its staff are culpable for unsafe restraint practices and failure to follow approved procedures.",
