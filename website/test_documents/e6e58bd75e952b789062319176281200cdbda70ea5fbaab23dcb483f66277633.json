    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 03/24/24, a 9-year-old child was pulled into a room by an\nunknown staff member. The child was subsequently spanked by\nthe staff member for acting out. The staff member utilized a belt to\nadminister the spanking. The child appeared to be screaming in\npain while being spanked.\nInvestigation MISACWIS indicates Complainant reported the allegation to\ncentralized intake on 3/26/24 at 6:33pm and left no contact\ninformation.\nInterviews:\nI contacted Chief Administrator (CA) requesting a list of 9-year-old\nchildren residing at the facility on 3/24/24. CA identified Youth R\nas the only 9-year-old there.\nI contacted Youth R’s Foster Care Worker and notified her of the\ninvestigation assignment. She had no additional licensing\nconcerns to report.\nI interviewed Government Worker 1. She said on 3/27/24, the\nanonymous complainant re-contacted centralized intake, provided\na phone number, and asked that Government Worker 1 call her.\nGovernment Worker 1 called the number and the Complainant\nanswered.\nComplainant initially reported Youth R was spanked on 3/24/24 by\nan unidentified staff. During her phone conversation with\nGovernment Worker 1, she changed the date to 3/22/24 at around\n7pm. and identified Supervisor as the person who hit the child with\na belt. Complainant could not or would not explain how she knew\nSupervisor hit the child or how she knew a belt was used.\n2",
    "I interviewed Youth R jointly with Government Worker 1 on\n3/28/24. He understood and complied with the rules of the\nforensic interview. Youth R named a favorite staff person and\nsaid there are no staff at the facility he dislikes. He denied he was\never spanked or beaten by a staff or youth. Youth R added he\nvisited with his mother the day after the alleged spanking\noccurred. Asked again, Youth R denied anything bad happened\nto him at Wolverine Center and denied having any marks or\nbruises on his body.\nSupervisor did not show for his scheduled interview at the facility\non 4/9/24 at 2:00pm.\nOn 4/11/24 I interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government\nWorker 1 via phone. He has worked at the facility for 22 years.\nSupervisor denied taking Youth R to a room and hitting or\nspanking him with a belt or anything else. He also denied ever\nneeding to physically restrain the child.\nI interviewed Youth N jointly with Government Worker 1. He\ndescribed Supervisor as “nice” and someone who “doesn’t hurt\nkids.”\nI interviewed Youth Z jointly with Government Worker 1. He\ndescribed Supervisor as “a good staff who knows what he’s\ndoing.”\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. She\ndenied seeing Supervisor spank any youth with a belt adding if\nshe had, she would have been mandated to report it.\nVideo:\nOnsite Government Worker 1 and I reviewed video footage of the\nsecond floor north residential hallway on 3/22/24 between 6:59pm\n– 9:00pm. Supervisor was never seen on that floor during that\ntime period.\nDocuments reviewed:\nMedical exams of Youth R dated 3/23/24 (the day after alleged\nincident) and 4/2/24 indicated he had no injuries.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis All evidence shows Supervisor did not spank or beat Youth R with\na belt or anything else.\n3",
