    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nSamaritas West CB410201266 is relocating from 207 East Fulton Grand Rapids, MI\n49503-3210 to 2080 Union Avenue SE Grand Rapids, MI 49507.\nIII. Methodology\nThe on-site inspection of the new space was completed on November 10, 2020.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe new office is located at 2080 Union Avenue SE Grand Rapids, MI 49507. This is\na two-story building that sits on the east side of Union Avenue SE and south of\nBurton Street SE. On the main floor is the lobby entrance, staff café area, restrooms\n(including family restrooms), several visitation rooms, several therapy rooms, work\nstations, several conference rooms, administration area, staff lockers, copier room,\nstaff cubicles, private staff work areas, supervisor rooms, and a file room. On the\nsecond floor is more staff workstations and cubicles along with offices for\nadministration and supervisors. The agency reports that this office space will allow\nthem to consolidate all of the services that they currently provide into one office\nbuilding (space). Overall, there is a significant amount of workspace and areas\ndesigned for positive family interactions. The office which contains the confidential\ninformation was observed and it was locked as was the file cabinet that continues\nthe CHRI information. There was a crosscut shredder for disposal of this confidential\ninformation. There is significant parking available for families and the agency reports\nthat they will be developing outdoor space for family visits in the near future. This\nspace is more than appropriate for the workings and providing services for this\nagency.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend the new location be approved for the address change of this child\nplacing agency.\n11/10/2020\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant",
