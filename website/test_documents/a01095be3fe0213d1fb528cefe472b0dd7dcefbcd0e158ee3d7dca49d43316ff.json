    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 punched Youth A.\nInvestigation I spoke to DHHS Worker on 7/26/23. Scheduling and allegations\nwere discussed.\nI spoke to Complainant 1 on 7/25/23. No new information was\nprovided.\nI reviewed the video of 7/25/23. The video shows Staff 1 and\nStaff 3 on the unit with the entire unit. Staff 1 is talking back and\nforth with Youth A. Staff 3 stands up and goes to Staff 1 and\nYouth A attempting to stop their conversation. Youth A gets up\nand then Staff 1 gets up and Staff 1 swings at Youth A with force\nthat causes her to fall onto the ground after she swings. Staff 1 did\nmake contact with Youth A on the side of his face. Youth A\nattempted to swing back but did not hit Staff 1. Staff 1 got back on\nher feet jumping around the room like a boxer in the ring. Multiple\nstaff were in the unit at this point and security grabbed Youth A\nand escorted Staff 1 out of the unit.\nInterviews were conducted face to face at the facility on\n7/27/23 with DHHS Worker:\nAdministrator 1: Administrator 1 reported that Staff 1 is a new\nstaff that just completed orientation and was on day one of\nshadowing staff. Administrator 1 reported that Staff 1 was not a\npart of the staff to youth ratio. Administrator 1 reported that the\nagency nurse saw Youth A after the incident, but he refused a\nreferral to the hospital. Administrator 1 reported the video shows\nthat Staff 1 attempted to punch Youth A. Youth A did have a small\nred mark on the face.\nYouth A: Youth A reported Staff 1 worked in the morning shift\nwith Staff 2. Youth A reported Staff 1 was inappropriate\nthroughout the day with the youth. Youth A reported Staff 1 would\ntell Staff 2, “don’t tell me what to do.” Youth A reported Staff 1 was\ndisrespectful with her comments. Staff 1 stated a comment that\n“all the kids are drug addicts” and called them “sassy little girls.”\nYouth A reported when Staff 3 came in for her afternoon shift Staff\n1 continued to state disrespectful comments. Youth A reported\nStaff 1 was using profanity with the youth.

Youth A reported that after\nhe stood up, Staff 1 punched him in the face. Youth A reported he\n2",
    "went to hit her and then security came out. Youth A reported that\nStaff 3 was requesting for security to come to the unit before they\nboth stood up. Youth A reported he saw the nurse after the\nincident but refused to go to the hospital.\nStaff 2: Staff 2 reported that he worked with Staff 1 throughout the\nday. Staff 2 reported he noted Staff 1 went “back and forth” with\nthe youth. Staff 2 reported that during shadowing, staff are\nsupposed to just watch but Staff 1 was not doing that. Staff 2\nreported he noted a “power struggle” between Staff 1 and the\nyouth. Staff 2 reported he had asked her to help him in a couple\nsituations and she did not, but he wasn’t sure if she was not\nwanting to listen or didn’t hear. Although Staff 1 was not to\nsupervise youth and only shadow, Staff 2 reported since he was\nthe only staff on the unit, he did have to ask Staff 1 to help him\nthroughout the day with tasks. Staff 2 reported he did not\ncommunicate with her about her behavior or step in when the\nyouth and Staff 1 were going “back and forth.”\nStaff 3: Staff 3 reported she came for her shift and the youth were\nin their rooms. Staff 3 reports, Staff 1 had told her that she “threw”\nsnacks in their rooms already. Staff 3 reported when they let the\nyouth out of their rooms, they escalated quickly. Staff 3 heard\nsomeone say, “get this bitch out of the pod,” referring to Staff 1.\nStaff 3 reported the youth said that Staff 1 called them, “faggots”\nand “gay ass” since the morning. Staff 3 reported she called for\nsupervision over the radio due to the climate of the pod. Staff 3\nreported that Youth A was agitated so Staff 3 asked him to take\nfive minutes in his room and then come back out. When Youth A\ncame back out, he sat at the table and Staff 1 started calling the\nyouth names. Staff 3 reported she attempted to stop Staff 1, but it\nwould not work. Staff 3 reported Youth A said, “I am sick of this\nshit” and Staff 1 stated back to youth A, “do something about it.”\nStaff 3 reported Youth A got up from the table to pour water on\nStaff 1 and pushed Staff 1 and then Staff 1 punched Youth A.\nStaff 3 reported Security 1 came in and grabbed Youth A.

All\nreported that they were called “sassy girls.” All youth reported that\nStaff 1 threw a punch and hit Youth A. All youth reported that Staff\n3",
    "1 was the second staff on their unit for the morning and afternoon\nshift.\nSecurity: Security reported that he went to the pod during first\nshift and Staff 1 was sitting in her chair with her eyes closed as if\nshe was sleeping. Security 1 reported he woke her up and told her\nshe was to be aware of the pod. Security 1 reported later they had\nbeen in the pod after Youth A and Staff 1 were separated and\nStaff 1 was escorted out.\nStaff 1: Staff 1 did not show up for her interview. Later in the day\nshe did come into the facility and the DHHS Worker was still in the\nbuilding. DHHS Worker attempted to interview Staff 1. Staff 1 did\ncome into the interview room but would not partake in the\ninterview and was escorted out by security guards.\nI reviewed the following documents:\nIncident report: Incident report was written on 7/25/23 and is\nconsistent with interviews.\nStaff 1 personnel file: Training documents were reviewed, and\nStaff 1 had completed her orientation. Clearances were completed\nand appropriate.\nYouth Health Referral and Medical Assessment: Completed on\n7/25/23 noted as follow up to the incident.\nAnalysis Video observation and interviews from all staff and youth, except\nStaff 1 confirm that Staff 1 physically assaulted Youth A, by\npunching Youth A in the face.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to student ratio\nSection (1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-to-\nDescription resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\n4",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not have a sufficient number of staff to provide for\nthe care of the youth.\nInvestigation Note: There were 10 youth on the pod on this day.\nInterviews:\nAdministrator 1: Administrator 1 reported that Staff 1 is a new\nstaff that just completed orientation and was on day one of\nshadowing staff. Administrator 1 reported that Staff 1 was not a\npart of the staff to student ratio.\nStaff 2: Staff 2 reported he had to ask for Staff 1’s help because\nshe was the other staff with him for his shift.\nStaff 3: Staff 3 reported Staff 1 was working the shift with her\nalthough she was in shadowing.\nYouth B, youth C, and Youth D: All youth reported that Staff 1\nwas the second staff in their unit for the morning and afternoon\nshift.\nI reviewed the following policy:\nStaff to Youth Ratio: …during normal waking hours shall be no\nless than 1:5\nAnalysis During the morning and second shift there was only one “regular”\nstaff supervising the youth. The second staff member was a new\nstaff completing the shadowing part of her training and not to be\ncounted in the staff to student ratio. The agency failed to maintain\nits’ identified staff to resident ratio. The identified staff ratio is one\nto five. The staffing ratio during this incident was one “regular”\nstaff to 10 youth.\nTechnical Assistance:\nOn 8/10/23, Technical Assistance was given in regard to:\nOrientation, Shadowing, Supervision, Hiring, training,\naccountability, responsibility, documentation regarding supervision\nand orientation, training and performance evaluations. A follow up\nmeeting was held on 8/17/23 with the same technical assistance.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
