Staff 1 threatened that she would \"smack a punk\nass kid\" however she did not. Youth B and Staff 1 were having a\nconversation about Youth B’s behaviors she displayed when\nYouth B said, she wants to hit staff when she gets made, Staff 1\nreplied, \"I want to hit y'all when I'm upset but I don't\".\nInvestigation Complainant/Staff 5 was interviewed via phone on 1/3/2024.\nShe reported being present when Staff 1 told Youth B that Staff 1\ngets mad with different youth at times and stated, “I want to smack\nthe hell out of all of you”. This occurred after Youth B shared “I\ncan’t control putting my hands on staff at times”.\nComplainant/Staff 5 also reported this conversation occurred after\nStaff 1 told Youth B, that Youth B didn’t learn her lesson after\nputting her hands on staff the last time. Staff 1 continued to tell\nYouth B, that Youth B is not learning the lesson even though\nYouth B was ignoring Staff 1 until Youth B walked away.\nComplainant/Staff 5 reported later in the day, while in the kitchen\nwith Staff 1, Staff 3 came into the kitchen and confronted Staff 1\nsaying Staff 3 heard what Staff 1 said to Youth B. Staff 1\nresponded by saying Staff 3 didn’t hear anything. Staff 3 told Staff\n1 she is not allowed to speak to the youth like she did with Youth\nB.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed via phone on 1/3/2024. She\nreported being made aware of the allegations and having Staff 1\nremoved from working until the investigation was completed. She\nalso reported this behavior is out of the norm for Staff 1.

    "slap my kids”. Staff 1 reported referring to her biological children\nrather than youth in the program. In regard to the incident with\nYouth A in the cafeteria, Staff 1 reported being asked to assist\nwith Youth A who was struggling in the cafeteria, so she went and\nswapped with Supervisor. Staff 4 was attempting to deescalate\nYouth A while Youth A was spitting and swinging at Staff 4 before\nbeginning to bang his head against the wall. Staff 1 told Staff 4 to\nstep back and Staff 1 began an intervention. Staff 1 wanted to get\nYouth A ready to meet with his caseworker, so Staff 1 raised her\nvoice in an effort to yell over Youth A who was screaming. Staff 1\nreported using this technique to get Youth A to listen to her. Staff\n1 also reported being told in the past by Administrator 3 to not\nraise her voice but just let the youth sit and scream. The next\nencounter with Youth A and Staff 1 occurred when Staff 1 was told\n(did not identify who) she was needed in the cafeteria again\nbecause Youth A was biting himself. Staff 1 went to the cafeteria\nwith Staff 6 and after Youth A began to calm down and Staff 1 was\nleaving the cafeteria, Youth A charged Staff 4. Youth A was\nswinging and striking Staff 4 so Staff 1 grabbed Youth A’s wrist in\na release hold when Youth A had grabbed Staff 4’s shirt putting\nhis hands at his side. Youth A continue to charge Staff 4 and Staff\n1 reported she said to Youth A, “you don’t think I will hit you. It’s a\ncold day in hell if you think I will let you hit a staff or allow a punk\nchild to hit me and abuse another staff who is half your size”.\nStaff 1 also reported Staff 3 spoke to her about Staff 1 using a\nloud voice. Staff 1 told Staff 3 that Youth A was acting out, so Staff\n1 started yelling because both Youth A and Staff 4 were yelling.\nStaff 1 was unable to recall what else was said between Staff 1\nand Staff 3. Staff 1 denied any disciplinary action in her personnel\nfile.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/4/2024.\nShe reported beginning work at the facility on 12/4/23 and only\nbeing on the floor with youth by herself for the past week.

Staff 1 suggested Youth B should not be going to\nfield day (scheduled for the next day) because of Youth B’s\nbehaviors the previous day. Youth B was reported to have\nresponded by saying, Youth B will get worked up sometimes and\nwant to hit staff. Staff 1 responded saying “I get mad at you kids\nand want to slap you kids”. Staff 2 reported Youth B ignored Staff\n1 and continued to work on a puzzle. Staff 2 told Youth B he was\ndisplaying good behaviors today. Staff 2 also reported redirecting\nYouth B so as not to escalate Staff 1. Staff 2’s fear was saying\n3",
    "something about Youth B ignoring Staff 1 would have escalated\nStaff 1. Staff 2 reported Staff 1’s tone when speaking to Youth B\nwas “quick, snarky and negative”, thus just being “not a good\ntone”. Staff 2 reported not saying anything to a supervisor\nbecause none were present at the time but later in the shift, Staff\n2 discussed the incident with Staff 4 and Complainant/Staff 5 and\nnow understands that in the future Staff 2 will seek out a\nsupervisor immediately.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/4/2024.\nStaff 3 reported being present for a portion of the incident between\nYouth A and Staff 1. Staff 3 was in the kitchen when she\noverheard muffled voices through the rolling door between the\nkitchen and cafeteria. She believed one voice was that of a youth\nand the other of a staff.

Supervisor also reported\nComplainant/Staff 5 and Staff 2 came to her later in the shift with\n4",
    "concerns of Staff 1’s treatment of Youth A and Youth B during the\nday. Supervisor informed Administrator 2 of the allegations and\nsought the correct path for reporting the information.
