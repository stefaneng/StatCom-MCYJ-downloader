Any violation listed in section 1 is also a MISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the following:\nISEP 6.49 Medical Passports\nAt the time the child is placed or re-placed, the foster care\nprovider shall receive the child’s Medical Passport, which must\ncontain the information required by MCL 722.954c(2) and DHHS\nPolicy FOM 801 (dated 3-1-2015) (or any successor policies\napproved by the Monitors).

Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHHS Contract violation. Please note that\nthere are additional DHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included in\nsection 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements except for the following:\n4",
    "FOM 722-06B Family Team Meetings\nTypes and Timeframes: FTMs must occur within the required\ntimeframes as outlined in policy.\nThree of eight foster care files reviewed did not have the required FTM’s\ndocumented as required by policy.\nThis is a repeat violation from the 2019 Interim Inspection Report with an\napproved CAP dated 10/25/2019.\nFOM 722-08E Foster Care/Juvenile Justice Action Summary\nThe DHS-69, Foster Care/Juvenile Justice Action Summary is\nused to document specific administrative actions or changes in\na case, including:\n Child fatality.\n Change in caseworker or organization.\n Change in parent contact information.\n Foster care transfer to adoption.\n Change in placement.\n Temporary break from placement.\n Program or case closing.\nOne of eight foster care files were reviewed. One of four cases that required an\naction summary lacked the documentation as required by policy.\nFOM 722-09 Foster Care – Updated Service Plan Supervisory Approval\nCase service plan approval process required the foster care\nsupervisor to:\nReview and approve the USP within 14 calendar days of the\nreport date.\nFive of twenty-eight Updated Service Plans reviewed were approved after the\nrequired 14-day timeframe.\nThis is a repeat violation from the 2019 Interim Inspection Report with an\napproved CAP dated 10/25/2019.\nFOM 722-08C Foster Care Parent Agency Treatment Plan & Service\nAgreement\nSignatures:\n5",
    "When competed, obtain all signatures as appropriate, including\nthose of parent(s)/guardian(s), foster care worker, supervisor,\nfoster parent, caregiver, any youth age 14 and older in the case\nof placement agency foster care cases, the local DHS office\ndesignee.\nThree of eight foster care files reviewed lacked the required caregiver signatures,\nwhich would indicate their involvement in the plan development.\nOne of three independent living files reviewed lacked the youth’s signatures.\nThis is a repeat violation from the 2019 Interim Inspection Report with an\napproved CAP dated 10/25/2019.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was provided technical assistance in the area of supervisory approval of\nservice plans. It was recommended the supervisors develop a tracking method when\nreturning reports for “re-work” as the caseworkers were not re-submitting them\ntimely resulting in late supervisor approval on service plans.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period in response to the 2019 interim audit.\nStaff were interviewed throughout the inspection. All staff interviewed reported\nfeeling very supported not only by their direct supervisor but by all of management.\nStaff had a good understanding of the job expectations and internal agency\nprocedures. Management reported the agency has had significant stability in staffing\nover the past year which has helped the agency obtain and maintain consistency in\ncaseworker assignment.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n6",
