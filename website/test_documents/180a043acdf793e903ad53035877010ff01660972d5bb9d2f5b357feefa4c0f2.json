It\nwas arranged that DHHS Specialist would call Consultant, so\nConsultant could participate in the interview via telephone.\nI interviewed Youth A via telephone on 04/14/2023, in\ncollaboration with DHHS Specialist, who was on site. Youth A\nconfirmed that she was previously placed at Children’s Village for\napproximately two months. Youth A could not remember the exact\ndate of her placement admission, she thinks it was 01/28/23,\naround 10pm. There where two staff members on the unit. Staff 2\nwas in the hallway going through her clothes and the other Staff 1\nwas doing her intake. Staff 1 had her strip naked in the bathroom\nbefore her shower. She said Staff 1 took all her personal\nbelongings including her eyeglasses. She said Staff 1 made her\nlift her breast and squat while totally naked. Youth A said the next\nday she did tell her therapist and the supervisor at Mandy’s Place\nabout being strip searched. Youth A could not recall if she told her\nFoster Care Worker about being strip searched.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Worker (FCW) on 04/17/2023\nvia telephone. FCW said Youth A was placed at Children’s Village\non 02/09/2023 and she was meeting with Youth A weekly while at\nChildren’s Village.
