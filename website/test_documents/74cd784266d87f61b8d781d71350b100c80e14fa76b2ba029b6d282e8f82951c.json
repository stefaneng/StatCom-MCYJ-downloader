    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules\nexcept for the following:\nR 400.12203 Financial stability.\n(1) An agency shall initially and annually develop and\nimplement a plan of financing for the operation of the\nagency in carrying out its programs and meeting the\nrequirements for licensing. A plan of financing shall include\nall of the following:\n(e) An audit of all financial accounts conducted annually\nby an independent certified public accountant not\nadministratively related to the agency. A copy of the audit\nshall be available to the department upon request.\nThe agency provided their annual budget. However, no annual\naudit had been conducted by an independent CPA.\nR 400.12212 Personnel records.\n(2) The personnel record shall contain all of the following\ninformation before employment may occur:\n(e) A record of any convictions other than minor traffic\nviolations from either of the following:\n(i) The Michigan state police or the equivalent state or\nCanadian provincial law enforcement agency where the\nperson usually resides.\nOne of one new social service worker did not have an ichat prior\nto employment.\n2.) This is a non-contracted agency and therefore not required to follow ISEP\nrequirements.\n3.) This is a non-contracted agency and therefore not required to follow MDHHS policy.\n4",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications (2) An agency’s policy on staff qualifications\nshall state all of the following: (a) A person who has unsupervised contact with\nchildren may not have been convicted of either of the following (i) Child abuse\nor neglect; (ii) A felony involving harm or threatened harm to an individual\nwithin the 10 years immediately preceding the date of hire. To assure this on an\nongoing basis, it is recommended that ichats and central registry clearances be run\nannually for all applicable staff and maintained in the employee file.\nV. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThe agency is moving its office to another location in early 2021. The new\naddress is 933 N Melborn, Dearborn 48128. An application was sent to DCWL\nidentifying the change. After the move, I will tour the new office either in\nperson or virtually due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nThere were no licensing rule violations at the Interim Inspection in 2019 and\nno DCWL investigations during this licensing period.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nrules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the\nfacility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nNovember 20, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDate November 20, 2020\nArea Manager\nLinda D.
