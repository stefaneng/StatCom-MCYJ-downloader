    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Care Worker did not properly do their job as they did not\nmake reasonable efforts and testified against agency\nrecommendation. Additionally, Program Director and Human\nResources were aware of these concerns and failed to address\nthem.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nNo phone contact information was provided by Complainant, so\nan email was sent to Complainant on 06/10/2025 providing\nComplainant with the opportunity to present/provide any additional\ninformation that was not included in the original complaint.\nComplainant did not return/respond to email so no additional\ninformation was provided at the time of this report.\nI interviewed Program Director by phone on 04/10/2025 and\n6/10/2025. Program Director stated Foster Care Worker was on\nleave but never returned and was no longer employed by the\nagency. Foster Care Worker 2 was assigned to the case along\nwith Program Manager and Supervisor. Program Director stated\nFoster Care Worker 2 reported there had been inaccurate\ninformation provided in the case record including social work\ncontacts that were alleged but not completed. Program Director\nstated the agency conducted an internal review and identified\nsocial work contacts entered by Supervisor that had not occurred.\nProgram Director stated Supervisor's employment was\nsubsequently terminated 1/31/2025 due to falsification. Program\nDirector reported Foster Care Worker 2 and Program Manager\nvoluntarily left employment with the agency. Program Director\nstated that due to recent staff turnover and related circumstances\nit was not unexpected that some complaints/allegations may be\nmade by former staff. The internal review did not identify any\nevidence to suggest Foster Care Worker did not make reasonable\nefforts or testify against agency recommendations.\nI interviewed Human Resources Director by phone on\n06/10/2025 who indicated Foster Care Worker, Foster Care\nWorker 2, Program Manager, and Supervisor no longer employed\nby the agency.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nPersonnel information received from Human Resource Director\nidentified the dates of employment as follows:\nFoster Care Worker 2 01/06/25 - 04/09/2025 - voluntary\nFoster Care Worker 07/22/24 - 05/12/2025 - voluntary\n2",
    "Program Manager 05/07/24 - 03/28/2025 - voluntary\nSupervisor 05/28/24 - 01/31/2025 - falsification\nThe only staff identified as available to consider for re-hire was\nFoster Care Worker. Program Director described Supervisor as\nnot to be considered for re-hire due to the falsification of social\nwork contacts. Program Director described Foster Care Worker 2\nand Program Manager as not to be considered for re-hire due to\nthe agency’s dissatisfaction with their work performance.\nThe internal investigation report was received and reviewed. The\ninternal investigation was initiated 1/14/2025 and completed\n1/31/2025. The internal investigation report indicated Supervisor’s\nemployment was terminated due to falsification of records by\nreporting social work contacts in the record that did not occur.\nProgram Manager was placed on a Performance Improvement\nPlan due to mismanagement of staff.\nThe internal review did not identify any evidence to suggest Foster\nCare Worker did not make reasonable efforts or testify against\nagency recommendations.\nThe Initial Service Plan for the period 1/5-2/03/2024, Updated\nService Plans for the periods 2/04-05/03/2024, 5/4-08/01/2024,\n8/02-10/21/2024, 10/22/2024-01/19/2025, and 1/20-4/17/2025\nwere all reviewed. Social work contacts and other documentation\nincluded in these reports indicated reasonable efforts were being\ncompleted by the case managers and staff of the agency.\nI reviewed agency court reports dated 2/26/2024, 6/05/2024,\n8/21/2024, and 1/02/2025. The information in these reports was\nalso consistent with determining reasonable efforts on the part of\nthe agency.\nI reviewed court findings dated 1/5/24, 3/4/24, 3/13/24,\n3/21/24,6/20/24, 6/28/24, 8/30/24, 11/05/24, 11/22/24,\n12/06/2024, 1/06/25, 2/03/25, and 4/30/2025. The contents of\nthese court findings were consistent with reasonable efforts being\ndetermined or not being required per MCL 722.638(1). The court\nfindings determined the children should be returned to the mother\nconsistent with the 1/06/2025 court order with discharge from\ncourt jurisdiction following the 4/30/2025 hearing.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance per interviews that were\ncompleted and documents that were reviewed. The interviews\nthat were completed with Program Director and Human\nResources Director determined that whatever else may have\n3",
    "occurred in the supervision and case management, Supervisor\nwas identified as providing false social work contacts associated\nwith this case management. The internal investigation by the\nagency substantiated the concerns that were reported were\ninvestigated. The findings of the internal investigation, case\nmanagement and court records reviewed did not substantiate\nmismanagement on the part of Foster Care Worker.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n07/1/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 7, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
