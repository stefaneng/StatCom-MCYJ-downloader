Youth A’s\nreply to Guardian was, “don’t know why I didn’t tell you”.

Guardian reported the\nfacility does a great job of informing him of any situations that\noccur.\nYouth B was interviewed on 8/5/25 by MDHHS Worker 1 at the\nfacility and the following is the note from that interview.\nYouth B has been living in the home for about a month and a half.\nYouth B stated she does feel safe in the home and mentioned\nStaff 1 as one of her favorite staff.

This document is the annual Well-Child review and\nindicates Youth A is in good health and needs to return for a Well-\nChild review in one year.\nIncident/Investigation Report Kalamazoo Department of\nPublic Safety Case Number 25-009857 Dated 8/11/25. Youth A\nis documented as alleging Staff 1 had hit Youth A leaving a pinch\nshaped bruise on Youth A’s side. Youth A also alleged hearing\nStaff 1 swearing at another youth (Youth B). This document\noutlines Youth A’s ex-boyfriends statement. The ex-boyfriend\nstated Youth A is known to make false reports and believes Youth\nA injured herself rather than being hit by Staff 1. Staff 1 was\ninterviewed and denied hitting or swearing at a youth as alleged.\nHR file for Staff 1 was reviewed, and she was hired to work at\nthe facility on 2/6/25. There is no disciplinary action documented\nin the file and she is up to date on required trainings.\nVideo Review:\nThe video footage of the day of the incident (Saturday August\n2, 2025, 1:00 pm to 3:20 pm) was reviewed. This involved three\ndifferent camera views (bedroom hallway, front stairway, and\ndining room) which captured all movement in each of the areas\nunder surveillance. This three-camera view also allowed for\nreview of Youth A’s bedroom door and areas that Youth A and\nStaff 1 were in during the time frame of the alleged incident. At\napproximately 2:53 pm, Youth A is observed going into her\nbedroom from the bathroom and at approximately 2:54 pm, Staff 1\nis observed coming up the front stairs and going into Youth A’s\nbedroom. Approximately 13 seconds later, Staff 1 is observed\ncoming out of Youth A’s bedroom and going back down the front\n9",
    "stairs. The camera view of the dining room footage shows Staff 1\nreturning to the dining room and placing a bottle (body oil) on the\ntable for Youth C. At approximately 3:01, Youth A is observed\ncoming down the front stairs and going into the dining room. Youth\nA stands next to Staff 1and Staff 1 is observed fixing the back of\nYouth A’s dress.\nWalk-through:\nA walk-through of this facility was conducted. This is an older 3-\nstory structure of which the youth have access to the first two\nfloors. Although the structure is older, it is maintained and all\nnecessary items such as plumbing are in working order. Each\nroom is furnished appropriately, and the temperature is kept at a\nnormal level. There is an appropriate amount of food (frozen,\nfresh, and dry) available for the youth.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as evidenced by interviews with\nstaff, youth, documents and video recording. Evidence does not\nsupport the allegations that Staff 1 hit Youth A. Evidence does\nsupport that this is a patterned behavior (statements by Guardian\nand ex-boyfriend) for Youth A and may be her way of trying to\navoid consequences of her choice to go AWOL and use a\nsubstance by reflecting the issue to Staff 1. Supporting the\ncompliance findings; Youth A showed Staff 4 and Youth B a bruise\non Youth A’s left hip a few days prior to the allegations.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding requesting more than\n90-days of information on each youth requesting placement in the\nfacility. If the facility is going to provide appropriate care, they\nneed to know what issues (in this case significant substance\nabuse) the youth are having throughout their lives.\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding staff entering a\nyouth’s bedroom and being off camera. Because of the significant\nmental and emotional issues youth are presenting, staff must take\nevery safeguard to protect themselves and the youth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n10",
    "(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv) Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth's\nbackground or appearance or mental state.
