    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nMethodist Children’s Home Society is adding a voluntary on-campus Transitional\nLiving Program for young men ages 18 – 21. This program is designed to offer\nhousing, employment opportunities, independent living skills, case management\nsupport and educational/ vocational choices to prepare and equip young adults to\nbecome independent productive members of the community.\nIII. Methodology\nThe agency has developed a program statement, participant agreement, YAVFC\nparticipant handbook, and appropriate forms to comply with BCAL licensing rules for\nIndependent Living, overall Foster Care contract compliance, and YAVFC eligibility for\nthe youth in this program.\nA meeting was held with Administrator Cynthia Bell and Foster Care Program Manager\nJulie Elkins on August 29, 2013, to review the handbook, forms and discuss necessary\nrevisions. Final revisions were completed on September 11, 2013 and approved.\nThe agency understands that the young adults on campus are to remain physically\nseparate from the children in the on-campus residential program.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nMethodist plans to begin the Transitional Living Program with three young adults and\ngradually increase the capacity to a maximum of 10. Foster Care Program Manager\nJulie Elkins will oversee the program and one foster care case manager will carry a\nmixed caseload of young adults and foster children not to exceed a total of 15.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend the Transitional Living Program (YAVFC) be added to terms of the\nagency’s license effective today.\nSeptember 11, 2013\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n2"
