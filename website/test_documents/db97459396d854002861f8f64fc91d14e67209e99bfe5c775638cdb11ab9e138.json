TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The facility was offered technical assistance regarding date of hire as one\nfile had two different dates of hire causing the employees evaluation date\nto be off.

Discussed the facility continuing to document\nall efforts made to get youth scheduled for regular appointments and as\nneeded appointments. The facility continues to use the Wheels program\nwhen available.\n• Discussed concerns verbalized by staff and ways to boost staff moral and\nshow staff appreciation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nRenewal 2024: Corrective Action Plan was recorded during this reporting period\nas a result of the Renewal Inspection completed on 10/1/2024. This CAP\ncontained rule violations of CCI Rule 400.4111 in that employee files were lacking\njob descriptions, CCI Rule 400.4113 in that employee file lacked verification of\neducation, CCI Rule 400.4114 in that employee files lacked tuberculosis testing,\nCCI Rule 400.4155 and 400.4156 in that initial treatment plan and updated\ntreatment plans lacked input from parents, staff, and referral worker, and CCI Rule\n400.4156 in that an initial treatment plan lacked signatures and date. The CAP\ncontained action items to ensure all documentations required prior to hire were in\nthe employee file prior to the official offer of employment being made and\nimplemented action steps of the social service supervisor reviewing and meeting\nwith social service worker to address the rule violations found regarding treatment\nplans. The CAP was effective as the facility had no repeat violations during this\ninterim inspection.\n• Special Investigation 2025SIC0000042 with CAP approval date of 11/21/2024\nwas a result of a violation regarding the facility not following their internal\nsupervision policy. The facility retrained staff and facility implemented camera\nreviews to ensure staff were properly supervising youth. The CAP was effective\nas the facility has had no concerns at this time regarding supervision and the CAP\nmonitoring period has ended.\n• Special Investigation 2025SIC0000564 with CAP approval date of 6/3/2025 was\na result of the facility not following their internal religious policy and staff not\n3",
    "receiving annual verbal de-escalation training. The facility updated their internal\nreligion policy, trained staff on the updated religion policy, and discussed the\nreligion policy at team meetings. The facility retrained staff on verbal de-escalation\ntraining and professionalism as well as implemented a training log system which\nthe trainer uses in order to schedule staff coming due for required trainings. The\nagency is currently complying with the CAP action steps, and DCWL continues to\nmonitor CAP compliance with no noted concerns.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facilities financial audit was reviewed by Michigan Department of Health &\nHuman Services Bureau of Audit due to concerns noted in past audit findings. The\norganization continues to have a decline in total net assets and a negative working\ncapital. There were repeated findings for the 2022 and 2023 audit. Corrective\nmeasures will be requested and required to mitigate the finding by the Bureau of\nAudit as the facility continues to not have staffing to complete the accounting\nfunctions including segregation of duties. The facility’s corrective measures\nindicated the Board of Directors would be involved in the day-to-day accounting\nprocess so that one individual is not responsible for three transaction components,\nauthorization, custody, and recordkeeping. It appears the Board of Directors have\nnot been involved in this process and the facility is not following their corrective\nmeasures. The organization’s financial condition will continue to be monitored.\nAlthough there are continuing concerns regarding finances, this has not affected\nthe care of the youth at the facility.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed. Chief administrator reported\nprevious CAP action steps assisted the facility to implement new proactive\nprocesses to ensure compliance regarding employee files. Chief Administrator\nfound having both the Human Resource Coordinator and Training Coordinator\nreview employee files prior to scheduling new employees for training has ensured\nall requirements are obtained and the facility is in compliance. The Social Service\nSupervisor has worked with Social Service Workers regarding the importance of\nobtaining family involvement in the treatment planning process and ensuring this is\ndocumented in treatment plans. The facility continues to hire new employees and\nis actively seeking out candidates. The facility continues to grow and improve on\nprocesses, communication, and growing leadership.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\n4",
    "Staff reported the youth are well cared for at the facility and all the youth's needs\nare met. Two staff reported the facility is running well and communication continues\nto be prioritized as an area of improvement. One staff reported some frustration\nwith communication and feeling as management does not always hear staff and\nvalue staff's input and perspectives.\nYouth interviews were conducted during the inspection. Youth reported being well\ncared for at the facility. Youth reported staff met youth's needs. All youth report\nfeeling safe and supported at the facility and no concerns at this time.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn onsite inspection and walk through of the facility occurred on October 7, 2025.\nThere were no issues or safety concerns noted.\nVII.
