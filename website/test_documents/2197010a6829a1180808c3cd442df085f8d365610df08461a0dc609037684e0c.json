    "V. CONSULTATION\nConsultation was not requested or provided at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during\nthis licensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nA corrective action plan, approved September 30, 2021, was submitted in response\nto the Interim Inspection completed on August 26, 2021. There was one repeat\nviolation established during the current renewal Inspection regarding the timely\nentering of face-to-face contacts into the MISACWIS system. The agency continues\nto successfully address and correct rule and policy violations established during the\nprevious annual inspection.\nChief Administrators Annual Assessment: (CAA)\nThe CAA was reviewed and it was thorough in addressing violations and CAP\nsuccesses during the licensing period. The CAA clearly identified areas of needed\nimprovement as well as areas of success. The Chief Administrator noted that due to\nlimited office time for workers due to COVID restrictions and precautions that it has\nbeen difficult to upload documents in a timely fashion. The Chief Administrator\nfurther noted that a foster care staff vacancy as well as a staff person on medical\nleave has presented challenges for the agency. The Chief Administrator reported\nthat the agency has also been assisting Grand Traverse/Kalkaska DHHS with direct\ncase coverage of foster care cases due to the lack of staff at that local office. These\nsituations have presented challenges to the agency which are successfully being\nmanaged.\nInterviews:\nStaff interviewed reported feeling supported by their supervisors and the\nadministrative team. They also reported that their supervisors are knowledgeable\nand readily available when they seek supervision. Staff further reported that they feel\nthat they are part of a supportive team and everyone works together. One staff\nreported that assisting Grand Traverse/Kalkaska DHHS has created additional\nchallenges for the team.\nField Analyst Findings:\n7",
    "On June 1, 2022, the Field Analyst identified safety concerns in a foster home\ninvolving unlocked bows and arrows as well as holes in a wall. A safety alert was\ngenerated and a compliant filed on June 3, 2022. The agency initiated special\nevaluation #2022C0630937 which addressed the concerns. The safety concerns\nhave since been rectified.\nDuring the entrance conference the Field Analyst provided the agency with\ninformation she had obtained during her visits to the homes. The Field Analyst\nreported that foster parents and relatives feel supported by the agency and no\nconcerns were raised.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\nJuly 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 1, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n8"
