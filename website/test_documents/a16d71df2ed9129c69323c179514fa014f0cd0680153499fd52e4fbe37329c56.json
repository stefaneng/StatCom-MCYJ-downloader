In both instances,\nagency workers were aware and did not file a 3200 or initiate a special evaluation.\nThere was no safety plan completed for the second incident. On 9/19/2021, a third\nincident took place in which the same caregiver assaulted another youth. This\nincident may have been prevented if the agency had followed protocols in the first\ntwo events.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 10/7/2021 I reviewed the on-line complaint document and spoke with\nComplainant X. Complainant X reported the complaint information put forth related\nto Child C and Child D was revealed while assessing a new child assault issue\n3",
    "involving Household Member (HHM) B, against Child E that was received on\n9/19/2021. Child C is a temporary court ward. Child D and Child E are Michigan\nChildren Institute (MCI) wards. All three children are placed in the foster home of\nFoster Parent A, who is licensed though St Clair County Department of Health and\nHuman Services (DHHS). Complainant X reported the current child’s assault could\nhave been prevented if the agency’s foster care and adoption staff had reported the\nprior incident. Complainant X reported being concerned that the agency did not\nreport the incidents to Foster Parent A’s certifying agency, St. Clair County DHHS.\nComplainant X advised that on 10/6/2021 FCW 2 had to be advised to file a children\nservice referral. St Clair County DHHS reported Ennis did not contact them related\nto these alleged assault matters.\nComplaint related to Child C:\nIn addition to the above, Complainant X reported or indicated the following:\n In August 2020 Foster Care Worker (FCW) 2 and Director 1 were informed\nthat Household Member (HHM) B (age 17 then), adopted son of Foster\nParent A who babysat and assisted with behavior management of the\nchildren, restrained Child C causing injuries.\n Complainant X spoke with FCW 2, the agency worker for Child C and Child D,\nwith respect to the new assault allegation by HHM B on Child E. FCW 2\ndisclosed that 18-year-old HHM B assaulted Child C and the agency had a\nsafety plan in place.\n The alleged assault matter related to Child C was not reported to law\nenforcement or Children Services.\n A special evaluation was not initiated pertaining to the foster parent.\n FCW 2 and Director 1 attempted to safety plan with Foster Parent A, who is\nlicensed through the St Clair County DHHS. Foster Parent A was\nuncooperative at first because he did not want HHM B to be included in a\nsafety plan.\n HHM B reportedly admitted to restraining Child C and Child C having injuries.\nComplainant X provided me email documentation related the 9/19/2021 complaint\nagainst Foster Parent A which contained an email statement from FCW 2 related to\nChild C. That statement from FCW 2 indicated the following:\n In September 2020 there were complaints of HHM B restraining Child C. FCW\n2 was the worker at the time. Child C was 12 and HHM B was 17. FCW 2\nattempted to put a safety plan in place with Foster Parent A. The day she tried\nto present the safety plan to Foster Parent A, he had received news of a\nrelative’s death. He would not agree to any terms of that safety plan. FCW2\nreported that safety plan was created on 9/16/2020.\nOn 10/17/2021 I interviewed Director 1 about the allegations regarding Child C by\ntelephone. Director 1 reported awareness of the incident with Child C. She said she was\nadvised by the supervisor that on 8/14/2020 Child C reported that HHM B pushed him.\nThen on 9/13/2020 HHM B restrained him. On 9/16/2021 they did a safety plan and also\ncompleted an incident report. Director 1 said, she thought they had contacted Children\n4",
    "Services about the incident. I advised her a 3200 was not documented in this child’s\nMISACWIS file. Director 1 was to check on that and the incident report. If a 3200 was\navailable, she would provide a copy to me along with the incident report. She reported\nthey would not have contacted the police about the incident. They would have let\nCentralize Intake take care of that. Director 1 reported not being sure whether they\ncontacted St, Clair County DHHS related to the incidents, but thought they did so.\nNo incident report, 3200, or case contact to St. Clair County DHHS was provided to\nme.\nOn 10/19/2021 I interviewed FCW 2 by telephone related to the allegations. FCW 2\nconfirmed being the FCW for Child C, and Child C’s placement with Foster Parent A\nbeing via a borrowed bed arrangement. Foster Parent A is licensed by St Clair County\nDHHS not Ennis. She also confirmed that there was an incident related to HHM B\nrestraining and assaulting Child C. She recalled Child C having a mark or scratch on his\nneck from the incident but could not recall whether this incident with the scratch was\nmixed in with others where restraints by HHM B was alleged. She said Child C had a\nlot of behavior issues in the foster home and was AWOLing a lot. She said many of the\ntimes that Child C would AWOL, Child C would run to his mother, who would report\nChild C reported being restrained by HHM B. FCW 2 said Child C’s mother did not\nknow whether the restraints were true or whether Child C just wanted to run to her\nhouse. FCW 2 admitted she did not report these alleged restraints to Foster Parent A’s\nlicensing agency.\nFCW 2 reported with regards to the incident of Child C having a mark or scratch on his\nneck from an incident with HHM B, Child C’s Day Treatment Night Watch (DTNW)\nprogram brought that to her attention. She thought DTNW reported the incident to the\nauthorities, because they contacted her about seeing the scratch/mark on Child C’s\nneck. Child C reported to DTNW staff he was restrained by HHM B. Child C was not\nactually sure how the mark came about. FCW 2 did not ask DTNW whether they\ncontacted Children Services about this incident. Nor did she follow up with them to\nassert whether they had. She did not contact Children Services. She said, there were a\nlot of Children Services complaints in the foster home, and she thought she had spoken\nwith someone from Children Services in 2020 about Child C’ s placement being a\nborrowed bed placement or other matters; but she could not recall the specifics. Nor\nwhen, or with whom that occurred. FCW 2 could not recall if FCS 3 reported the\nincidents to Children Services or anyone in Children Services.\nFCW 2 did not recall writing an incident report about the matter. She acknowledged not\nreporting the matter to St. Clair County DHHS, the certifying agency, so that a special\nevaluation could be initiated pertaining to Foster Parent A’s license. FCW 2 reported\nthat she and her supervisor, FCS 3 developed a safety plan for Child C. The plan was\nthat HHM B would not place his hands on Child C or any other foster child. Foster\nParent A would not commit to that safety plan and refused to sign it. FCW 2 was unable\nto produce a written copy of that plan. She submitted an email to me about it on\n10/20/2021, but no report was attached. On 9/16/2020, the same day Foster Parent A\n5",
    "refused to sign the aforementioned safety plan, Director 1 intervened and revised the\nsafety plan with Foster Parent A. Foster Parent A signed the revised plan.\nOn 10/20/2021 I interviewed FCS 3 by telephone related to this complaint. FCS 3\nrecalled the incident. She affirmed FCW 2’s reporting of how FCW 2 became aware of\nthe incident/Child C having a mark or scratch on his neck. The reporting came via an\nemail from the DTNW program; and the email said DTNW staff were contacting\nChildren Services.\nFCS 3 acknowledged that she did not contact Children Services or St. Clair County\nDHHS, the certifying agency. She also acknowledged there are likely requirements for\ntheir agency to report concerns to a certifying agency about that agency’s foster\nparents; but she was not sure of them. She provided me a copy of a 9/17/2020 email\nthe agency sent out in regard to the safety plan that Foster Parent A refused to sign.\nShe said this email was sent to the St Clair County DHHS licensing, POS Monitor and\nPOS Supervisor.\nMy review of that email showed the email:\n Was from Director 1 to FCW 2, FCS 3 and three “DHHS” staff, inclusive of a\nnamed prior DHHS licensing worker, but not the supervisor.\n The email advised of Foster Parent A’s refused to sign a safety plan and\nrequest for a FTM (Family Team Meeting).\n Did not indicate it was alleged that HHM B restrained Child C or that it was\nalleged Child C had an injury.\nMy review of FTM referenced above showed:\n It was held on 9/24/2020 reportedly to discuss Child C’s placement. The FTM\ndid not document attendance by anyone from DHHS- Licensing.\n The detail and outcome section did not include information of a discussion\nrelated to Child C being restrained by HHM B or alleged or reported injuries to\nChild C from the incident.\nOn 10/27/2021 I spoke with St Clair County DHHS Licensing Supervisor X0 and St Clair\nCounty DHHS Licensing Worker XX by telephone, separately.\n DHHS Licensing Supervisor X0 reported them not being the licensing worker\nnor supervisor of the foster home in 2020. She said they did not know about the\nallegation pertaining to Child C. She, as well as DHHS Licensing Worker XX\nreported learning about this matter when the assault allegation by HHM B to\nChild E came forth.\nDHHS Supervisor X0 reached out to the prior licensing supervisor and worker by\nemail on 10/27/2021 to ask whether one of them were made aware of the\nreported incidents in Foster Parent A’s home in 2020. DHHS Licensing\nSupervisor X0 advised these prior DHHS licensing staff of the alleged restraint\nincidents by HHM B of Child C on 8/25/2020 and 9/13/2020. She further advised\nthem that Foster Parent A’s provider record was reviewed and there were not\n6",
    "contacts. She indicated in the email, “however, we are checking with you directly\nin the event that licensing was aware but forgot to add the contact.”\n DHHS Licensing Worker XX, affirmed DHHS Licensing Supervisor X0’s\nreporting. She reported, FCW 2, nor anyone else from the agency contacted her\nrelated to an incident. DHHS Licensing Worker XX reported reaching out to\nFCW 2 by emails when completing Foster Parent A’s 2021 annual report (CWL-\n4004). She tried to get feedback and input from FCW 2 pertaining to the foster\nparent’s care and supervision of children FCW 2 had placed in the foster home.\nFCW 2 did not respond to DHHS Licensing Worker XX’s emails for information.\nOn 10/28/2021 I was included in an email response to DHHS Licensing Supervisor X0\nfrom DHHS Licensing Supervisor X0X. DHHS Licensing Supervisor X0X replied that\nlicensing was not aware of the reported 8/25/2020 or 9/13/2020 attacks events reported\nas occurring in Foster Parent A’s foster home related to Child C by HHM B.\nOn 10/28/2021 I interviewed Adoption Worker 4 by telephone. Adoption Worker 4\nreported she had no information related to the allegations pertaining to Child C. She\nreported Child C is a Temporary Court Ward (TCW) and she has no contact with TCWs.\nReviewed\nChild C’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n Child C is a temporary court ward.\n He was placed in Foster Parent A’s foster home on 7/24/2020-8/2/2020.\n Child C was back and forth between Foster Parent A’s foster home and\ndetention centers in Macomb County between 8/3/2020 and 12/21/2020. He\nwas last placed in Foster Parent A’s home from 12/21/2020 until 2/5/2021.\n Various social contacts of Child C AWOLing from Foster Parent A’s foster\nhome.\n An 8/14/2020 social work contact related to: a home visit following a telephone\ncall from Child C’s mother about Child C AWOLing. Child C reporting HHM B\nlaid hands on him by pushing him. Foster Parent A reporting HHM B retaliated\non Child C after Child C first laid hands on HHM B.

FCW 2\nindicating it was determined Child C would remain in the home and Child C was\nokay with that.\n A 9/13/2020 social work contact by FCW 2 of an email from a DTNW worker to\nFCW 2, and other DTNW staff. This email indicated or showed:\n The DTNW staff reported that Foster Parent A called them about Child\nC having pushed two of the children in the home, then AWOLing and\nreturning with Child C’s mother.\n DTNW staff went to the home and Foster Parent A explained Child C\nwas messing with the bathroom door and was attempting to open it\nwhile another child was using the bathroom. The two boys got into an\nargument about the incident. Child C attempted to fight the other child\nand HHM B restrained Child C. That’s when Child C ran off. Child C\n7",
    "was seen to have a cut on the back of his neck and small red mark on\nhis collar bone. That, thereafter, Foster Parent A conversed about the\nincident with Child C’s mother and Child C became upset, cursing\nFoster Parent A and ultimately rode off on his bike.\n The DTNW director responded to the email related to keeping the\nagency up to speed on issues with Child C.

    "licensing related to an assault, discipline or maltreatment allegation pertaining to\nthis foster home with respect to Child C.\nComplaint related to Child D\nComplainant X indicated and reported the following related to this complaint matter:\n Three months ago (from the date of this complaint) FCW 2 and an unknown\nadoption worker were informed MCI ward, Child D was assaulted by HHM B\nwhose was now 18.\n FCW 2 learned that Child D’s mouth was bleeding following the assault.\n FCW 2 spoke with Child D about the situation; and Child D reported the\ninformation was accurate. Child D reported he was scared to return to this\nfoster home. Child D begged FCW 2 to not report the information because he\nfeared he would be assaulted again.\n Child D also advised FCW 2 he is harassed and punished for having contact\nwith his brother.\n FCW 2 did not report this information to law enforcement or Children Services.\n FCW 2 reported she spoke with her supervisor, Foster Care Supervisor (FCS)\n3 and Director 1 about this incident with Child D. FCW 2 reported it was\ndecided they would file a complaint after Child D moved to a new placement.\nThis was because it would not do any good; and they reportedly had nowhere\nelse to place Child D.\n Foster care and Adoption did not complete a safety plan around the reported\nincident. A special evaluation and complaint was not generated.\n Complainant X had contact with Child D’s sibling, Child F. Child F had reported\nhis siblings get assaulted in their foster home regularly. Child F reported FCW 2\nhad gone to the foster home and gotten Child D. That Child D’s mouth was\nbleeding.\n FCW 2 was contacted about the above. FCW 2 confirmed the injury and did\nnothing, as previously mentioned.\nOn 10/17/2021 I interviewed Director 1 about these allegations by telephone. Director 1\nreported not being aware of allegations of Child D being harmed by HHM B. She said if\nChild D had reported being fearful of going back to the foster home, and had reported\nsomeone was assaultive to him, they would not have sent him back there. She denied\nhaving knowledge of Child D having a busted or bleeding mouth from an incident with\nHHM B. She reported being aware of Child F reporting that all of his siblings\n(approximately 15 of them), including Child D, were being maltreated in their foster\nhomes. Director 1 reported that was in August of 202. She directed FCW 2 to\ninvestigate the allegations made by Child F. I asked Director 1 to provide\ndocumentation of her directive to FCW 2 regarding investigating the allegations made\nby Child F, or any information, (emails, incident reports, referrals to Children Services)\nthat supported that she or FCW 2 had looked in the allegations made by Child F. I did\nnot receive any such documentation.\n9",
    "On 10/19/2021 I interviewed FCW 2 by telephone related to these allegations. FCW 2\nreported sometime between the end of July or first of August of this year, Child D’s\nbrother, Child F reported to her that HHM B smashed Child D’s face against or into the\ngarage. Child F reported this information to her during a time she was transporting\nChild F to visit his sister. Child F reported the incident had happened sometime in\nNovember of 2020. FCW 2 said Child F was also living in Foster Parent A’s foster home\nin November of 2020. Therefore, she asked Child F why he didn’t report this information\nto her back then. Child F reported he had just found out about it. FCW 2 reported,\nafter learning of this information from Child F, she called her supervisor, who was\nDirector 1, at the time. Director 1 advised her to speak with Child D.\nFCW 2 reported she was unable to speak with Child D right away. She spoke with Child\nD on 8/25/2021 while transporting him from a detention center to the office. Child D\nconfirmed that he was assaulted by HHM B. Child D was not sure of the exact date of\nthe incident. He reported the incident was a couple of months ago, not November 2020.\nFCW 2 asked Child D why hadn’t he reported it to her. He responded that because,\n“workers don’t’ believe kids.” FCW 2 said she asked Child D whether he was injured\nfrom the incident; and Child D said his mouth was bleeding. FCW 2 said, Child D was\nplaced in a foster home with another of his brothers for the night. The agency searched\nfor a placement for him the next day without success. FCW 2 said she spoke with Child\nD about his placement options. She said, Child D did not say he did not want to go\nback to Foster Parent A’s home. Child D “just looked nervous” (FCW 2 did not elaborate\non this); and said “Okay”. Child D went back to Foster Parent A’s home because they\ndid not have a placement for him. FCW 2 reported, she asked Director 1 what to do\nabout the allegation of what HHM B had done and reporting it. FCW 2 reported it was\ndiscussed that given Foster Parent A was the only likely placement option for Child D,\nthe incident happening months ago, and Child D not reporting it, Director 1 said “We\ncould wait” until Child D moved, to report the incident. FCW 2 did not report completing\nan incident report or safety plan around this incident. She emailed me on 10/20/2021,\nher last day employment with Ennis. She reported she had attached an informal safety\nplan she had set up with Child D while Child D was in the other foster home, but no\nsuch document was attached.\nFCW 2 acknowledged knowing she is a mandated reporter. She stated that’s why she\nasked her supervisor what to do. She said, after Director 1 said to wait about the\nreporting, Child D went back to Foster Parent A’s home. FCW 2 denied any new\nallegations of harm to Child D coming forth after Child D returned to Foster Parent A’s\nfoster home. She admitted an incident came up related to another child in the foster\nhome in September 2021. That incident involved Child E and inappropriate behavior by\nHHM B with that child. She did not complete an incident report about it. She did not do\na safety plan at the time, because there was an open investigation by Children\nServices. She did not know whether if she had done more related to reporting the other\nincidents that the one with Child E may not have occurred.\nOn 10/20/2021 I interviewed FCS 3 by telephone related to this complaint. FCS 3\nreported not being told of an incident related to Child D. She reported not having\n10",
    "information about this allegation. She acknowledged another complaint had come forth\nrelated to Child E and provided a copy of the safety plan completed.\nOn 10/27/2021 I spoke with St Clair County DHHS Licensing Supervisor X0 and St Clair\nCounty DHHS Licensing Worker XX by telephone, separately. DHHS Licensing\nSupervisor X0 reported they did not know about the allegation pertaining to Child D.\nShe and DHHS Licensing Worker XX learned about this matter when the assault\nallegation by HHM B to Child E came forth.\nDHHS Licensing Worker XX, affirmed DHHS Licensing Supervisor X0’s reporting. FCW\n2, nor anyone else from the agency contacted her related to the 2021 incident\npertaining to Child D. As reported earlier in this report, DHHS Licensing Worker XX\nreached out to FCW 2 by emails to obtain feedback from FCW 2 related to the\nsupervision of children FCW 2 had placed Foster Parent A’s foster home. FCW 2 did\nnot respond to DHHS Licensing Worker XX’s emails. St. County Clair DHHS was never\nmade aware of a need to open a special evaluation on the foster home.\nOn 10/28/2021 I interviewed Adoption Worker 4 by telephone. Adoption Worker 4\nreported being Child D’s adoption worker since April 2020. She denied Child D ever\nreporting assault allegations against HHM B; or reporting he was afraid to go back to\nthat foster home. If, he had, she would have filed a 3200. She said FCW 2 never told\nher that Child D made such allegations. She reported if the incident was documented in\nChild D’s Updated Service Plan (USP) she would not have learned about it that way\nbecause she does not review the USPs. She completes quarterly adoption progress\nreports. She conferences quarterly with the FCW on the status of the adoption and what\nmay be happening on the child’s case in general.

    "ANALYSIS: Ennis staff became aware of at least two incidents of possible\nassault or inappropriate discipline by HHM B related to Child C\nin Foster Parent A’s foster home in the summer of 2020.\nNeither FCW 2, FCS 3, nor Director 1 reported these concerns\nto Foster Parent A’s licensing agency/worker so that the matter\ncould be examined further via a special evaluation with respect\nto possible foster home rule violations.\nAdditionally, FCW 2 and Director 1 became aware of allegations\nof possible maltreatment by 18-year foster home HHM B in or\naround July or August 2021; and they did not report that\ninformation to the foster home’s licensing agency. The agency\nsent Child D back to the foster home and did not develop a\nsafety plan related to the alleged incident.\nIn these instances, the agency did not work directly with relevant\nindividuals related to these incidents.

Nor did the\nagency contact Children Services related to Child D’s reported\nassault and mouth injury by this same, now 18-year-old,\nhousehold member, in July or August of 2021.\nThe agency failed to adhere to the rule in these incidents. The\nagency’s failure to report may have contributed to Child E’s\nsubsequent reported maltreated, in this foster home, by the\nsame household member, HHM B.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n13",
