    "Youth A was interviewed over video on 02/15/2023. Since the\nincident in question occurred on 02/09/2023 his placement had\nchanged to the Saginaw County Jail. Youth A stated that he feels\nhe gets more respect from staff at the jail than at his previous\nplacement and singled out Staff 1 as a main source of that\ndisrespect. Youth A recalled the incident in question. He stated\nthat he was participating in a group session with the rest of his unit\nwhen Staff 4 came in to join. Youth A stated that he thought they\nwere finished, and he remembered Staff 4 stating that they\nneeded to continue. Youth A recalled Staff 1 saying something to\nthe effect of “Go ahead and snitch” regarding rules in the program\nabout youth holding each other accountable. Youth A stated that\nthis upset him, and he voiced that, and Staff 1 asked him to have\na Behavior Management Timeout, which upset him more. Youth\nA stated that he wanted to fight Staff 1 at that point in time\nbecause he was tired of being treated that way and admitted to\npicking up a chair and throwing it at Staff 1 and then attempting to\nhit him. Youth A stated that the next thing he knew was that he\nwas on the floor with several staff surrounding him. He stated that\nhe believed Staff 2 took him to the floor. Youth A stated that he\nwas on the floor on his stomach in a prone position with one arm\nunderneath him at that point. He recalled Staff 2 having his hands\non him and telling him to breathe and calm down. Youth A stated\nthat this helped, and he was able to be calm and get up with Staff\n2 once he knew that was who was with him and that Staff 1 was\nnot in the room anymore. Youth A stated that he had a few\nscratches as a result of the incident but no further injuries in his\nopinion. Youth A stated that he was offered to see the nurse after\nthe restraint but declined.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on 02/22/2023. She\nstated that she got called into the unit and witnessed the incident\nin question. When she came into the unit, she witnessed Youth A\nstanding up and cussing and getting more agitated. She stated\nthat she and Staff 3 started to move other youth into their rooms\nas it is standard practice at the facility. This is done in order to\nreduce the number of witnesses or other youth that could get\ninvolved in an incident as it is escalating. She stated that all of the\nyouth were compliant in this situation. Supervisor 1 recalled that\nas this was occurring, she turned around and saw Youth A pick up\na chair and throw it at Staff 1. Supervisor 1 stated that Youth A\nthen charged at Staff 1 and very quickly ended up on the ground\nnear the rear wall of the unit. Supervisor 1 described this\nsequence of events as Youth A charging Staff 1 and attempting to\nhit him, and then both Youth A and Staff 1 falling backwards\n2",
    "towards the wall. Supervisor 1 recalled that Staff 2 was able to\nphysically restrain Youth A. She stated that she asked Staff 1 to\nleave the unit in order to remove the person that the youth was so\nfocused on and possibly triggered by, and Staff 1 did so.\nSupervisor 1 recalled that, at this point in time, Staff 2 was nearest\nto Youth A and Supervisor 1 already saw Youth A start to calm\ndown. Supervisor 1 remembered Staff 2 asking Youth A to get up\nand Youth A did so voluntarily, and they walked Youth A to his\nroom. Supervisor 1 stated that the incident ended at that point and\nthere were no visible injuries to Youth A. She stated that she\nparticipated in checking on Youth A in the variable 15-minute\nrequirements as Youth A was in his room and secluded after the\nincident. At this point in time, Youth A was still rotating between\nbeing calm and being escalated. Supervisor 1 recalled offering\nYouth A over the counter medication if he had any physical pain\nas a result of the restraint and he refused this.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on 02/22/2023. He\nstated he recalled the incident in question with Youth A. Staff 1\nstated that he was involved from the beginning to the point in time\nwhen Supervisor 1 asked him to leave the incident. Staff 1 stated\nthat the unit was having a group session with Staff 4 as this\noccurs several times per week. Staff 1 recalled that Youth A was\nagitated, and he believed he was mad at Staff 1 because Staff 1\nhad provided some feedback to the group earlier about\ninappropriate use of their “checking system” where youth are\nrequired to hold each other accountable. Staff 1 recalled that\nYouth A was talking to Staff 4 about who instructed the group to\nstop with the “checking” and Staff 1 made a choice to speak up\nand state that he had in order to provide clarity to the\nconversation. Staff 1 recalled that Youth A stated something to the\neffect of “don’t call me a snitch” at that moment, but Staff 1 denied\never stating that word or calling Youth A that himself. He also\nremembered that no one else in the room ever used that word.\nStaff 1 recalled that Youth A continued to escalate verbally and\nthat in response Staff 1 made the choice to call a behavior\nmanagement time out. Staff 2 and Staff 3 were called to the unit\nand started to escort the rest of the unit to their rooms. As this\noccurred Staff 1 turned around from a separate youth’s doorway\nto see Youth A pick up a chair and throw it at him. Staff 1 stated\nthat he was able to deflect the chair coming at him only to see\nYouth A rush him and start to throw punches. Staff 1 recalled that\nthe other staff in the room immediately came to his assistance as\nYouth A essentially tackled him into the wall. Staff 1 named\nSupervisor 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 as the other staff in the room at\n3",
    "that moment. As Youth A rushed forward, Staff 1 recalled that he\nwas only able to grab Youth A’s hands to stop Youth A’s attempts\nto punch him, but no other restraint methods were able to be used\nin that quick timeframe. Staff 1 stated that Youth A quickly ended\nup on the ground with Staff 2 having the most immediate physical\ncontact with him. Staff 1 clarified that Staff 2 assisted him in\nplacing Youth A on the ground and Staff 2 physically restrained\nthe youth. At that point Supervisor 1 asked Staff 1 to leave the\nunit in order to help de-escalate the situation. Staff 1 stated that at\nthat point he left the unit and proceeded to start working with a\ndifferent unit and helping them go through their shower process.\nStaff 1 stated that he eventually did make it back to Youth A’s unit\nand heard Youth A yelling at him from his room. Staff 1 stated that\nhe never heard Youth A complain about any pain in any form.\nStaff 1 stated that he was in this unit a couple more times before\nhis shift ended, but was never alone with Youth A after the\nincident. Staff 1 stated that he did not recall ever having any\nissues with Youth A prior to this incident but that he did remember\nhearing Youth A talk about wanting to make it to the county jail\nbecause he did not feel it was appropriate for him to be placed at\nthe juvenile facility. Staff 1 stated that he brought this up because\nhe felt like this might have been a motivating factor for the incident\nescalating so quickly.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on 02/22/2023. He\nstated that he was involved in the incident in question. His\ninvolvement began with being called on the radio in the request\ncoming through to come to Youth A‘s unit. Staff 2 stated that when\nhe came into the unit he essentially walked right in and saw Youth\nA pick up a chair and throw it at Staff 1. He then saw Youth A rush\nat Staff 1 and start to throw punches, and both of the individuals\nfell into the wall as a result. Staff 2 stated that he was able to get\nto both, Youth A had fallen to the ground. Staff 2 stated that he\nwas able to get his own hands-on Youth A’s wrists to perform a\nfloor restraint and attempt to de-escalate Youth A. Staff 2 stated\nhe started speaking to Youth A to tell him that Staff 1 was gone\nand identify himself. Staff 2 stated that he had felt like he had a\ngood relationship with Youth A and thought he could help de-\nescalate him at that moment. Staff 2 stated that he heard Youth A\ntalking the entire time they were on the ground, which was about a\nminute or so. Youth A stated “I’m going to county” over and over.\nStaff 2 stated that he then asked Youth A if he was ready to get up\nand be safe and Youth A confirmed this. Staff 2 recalled that\nYouth A got up voluntarily and walked to his room. Staff 2 saw\nYouth A in his room a short time afterwards and recalled that\n4",
    "Youth A was at times getting more upset over the incident but\nthat, when asked about why the incident occurred, Youth A didn’t\nwant to talk about it.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on 02/22/2023. He\nstated that he was not involved with the incident, but he did\nprovide follow up work with Youth A after the restraint in order to\nensure proper medical care. Supervisor 2 stated that Youth A was\nuncooperative for the nurse the next day. Supervisor 2 supervised\nYouth A for a shower the morning after the incident and all he\nreally recalled Youth A saying was that he “wanted to go to\ncounty.” Supervisor 2 stated that he asked on multiple occasions\nif Youth A was feeling okay or if there were any injuries from the\nincident, and Youth A never stated that there were. At the end of\nthe shower Youth A was asked by Supervisor 2 if he wanted to\nsee the nurse again and Youth A declined.\nStaff 3 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on 02/22/2023. He\nstated that he had participated in the incident and that he was\ncalled to the unit as it was beginning. He stated that he walked in\nwith Staff 2 and saw Youth A pick up the chair to throw at Staff 1.\nStaff 3 stated that he next saw Youth A rush Staff 1 and throw\npunches at him. Staff 3 stated that he did not participate in the\nrestraint, but he helped ensure that the other youth in the unit did\nnot escalate themselves as it was occurring. Staff 3 stated that he\ndid not see anything of concern during the restraint that was\nperformed by Staff 2 of Youth A and that he did not believe that\nYouth A was slammed to the ground, but that Youth A‘s own\nmomentum from charging at Staff 1 is what caused him to fall to\nthe ground. Staff 3 stated that he did not believe the restraint\noccurred for more than a minute, and that the only time staff had\ntheir hands on Youth A was Staff 1 blocking punches being thrown\nat him and then Staff 2 helping lift Youth A up when he had\ncalmed down. He stated that he never heard anyone use the word\nsnitch during the entire interaction.\nYouth B was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on 02/22/2023. He\nstated that he was in Youth A’s unit at the time that this incident\noccurred and saw the entire incident unfold. Youth B stated that\nhe knew Youth A was upset off and on the entire day and that he\nhad heard Youth A state several times prior that he did not believe\nhe should be there and wanted to go to the county jail for\nplacement. Youth B stated that he was in the group conversation\n5",
    "that is run by Staff 4 when Youth A got more upset. Youth B\nstated that he was asked to go to his room and did so voluntarily\nwhen Youth A threw the chair at Staff 1. He stated that he did not\nsee this but did see Youth A rush Staff 1 and throw punches at\nhim. Youth B stated that he did not get a good view of the restraint\nbecause there were several other people in the way, but he did\nstate that the entire incident did not last more than a minute or two\nand he saw Youth A get up on his own and go to his room. Youth\nB stated that he never heard anyone use the word snitch other\nthan Youth A accusing Staff 1 of calling him that during the\ninteraction.\nYouth C was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on 02/22/2023. He\nstated that he was in a unit placed with Youth A when the incident\noccurred. He recalled that the unit was doing their group session\nwith Staff 4 as Youth A began to escalate. Youth C stated that he\ndid not recall the word snitch being used by anyone, but he did\nremember Staff 1 saying something to the effect of “do the right\nthing” to Youth A as Youth A got more upset. Youth C stated that\nhe has seen Youth A get escalated in past incidents very quickly\njust as occurred in this incident. Youth C stated that he was\nwalking to his room as requested by staff. Youth A threw a chair\nat Staff 1, which Youth C was not able to fully see. Youth C stated\nthat it is facility rules that youth are supposed to avert their eyes\nand follow staff directives when there is an escalating incident\nsuch as this. Youth C stated that he did not see the full restraint,\nbut he was able to state that the entire incident started and ended\nvery quickly and that he did see Youth A walking to his room on\nhis own accord at the end of it.\nStaff 4 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced face-to-face visit to the facility on\n02/22/2023. She stated that she is a therapist who runs group\nsessions at the facility. Staff 4 recalled that she was running the\ngroup session for Youth A’s unit on the day of the incident. She\nrecalled that Youth A was getting emotional about the group rules\nand accountability between the youth in the unit when it appeared\nthat Youth A unnecessarily turned his anger towards Staff 1 after\nbeing properly redirected. Staff 4 stated that Youth A began to\nrefuse Staff 1’s directives and quickly escalated. She recalled that\nhe took off his shirt and then picked up a chair and threw it at Staff\n1. Staff 4 stated that Youth A then rushed Staff 1 and they both\nquickly fell to the floor near the wall of the unit. She stated that she\ncould not remember exactly who was on the floor with Youth A at\nthat point. Staff 4 did recall that Staff 1 left the unit and Staff 2\n6",
    "took over attempting to communicate with Youth A and was able\nto get Youth A to stand up and walk him to his room. Staff 4 stated\nthat she never heard the word snitch from anyone, other than\nYouth A accusing Staff 1 of calling him that. Staff 4 stated that she\nwas not involved with Youth A in the immediate aftermath of the\nrestraint.\nDocuments reviewed:\nVideo recording of the unit that contained the incident occurred on\n02/09/2023. There was no audio available for the video. The\nvideo is approximately three minutes and fifteen seconds long. In\nthe video it can be seen that the unit including Youth A was\nparticipating in a group session run by Staff 4. At the 0:30 mark\nYouth A appears to begin to escalate and Staff 1 can be seen\nattempting to ask other youth to move towards their rooms. As\nYouth A escalates further, he takes off his pants and sweatshirt\nand moves more around the unit as other youth go to their rooms.\nStaff 1 has a calm physical demeanor during this part of the video.\nAt the 1:10 mark Youth A picks up a chair and throws it at Staff 1\nand then immediately rushes him. When Youth A gets to Staff 1,\nhe begins to throw punches at him and Staff 1 appears to protect\nhimself and catches Youth A’s wrists. Staff 1 falls backwards\ntowards the back wall of the unit, continuing with the momentum\nof Youth A coming at him. Staff 1 continued to hold on to Youth\nA’s wrists as they both fall to the ground, with Youth A falling to his\nback and Staff 1 falling forward over the top of him. At no point in\nthe video is there evidence that Youth A was slammed to the\nground, nor does Staff 1 fall directly on top of Youth A. Youth A\ncontinued to attempt to punch Staff 1 in the head or upper body as\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 2 came to them. As they fall to the ground,\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 2 intervene by using their hands to pull\nYouth A and Staff 1 apart. It should be noted that Youth A\ncontinued to struggle and attempt to hit Staff 1 until he was laid\ndown face first on the ground by Staff 2 at the 1:30 mark of the\nvideo. This was not done in an aggressive manner. At this point\nStaff 1 was able to separate himself from Youth A and walked\naway. While Staff 2 is on the ground holding Youth A, Supervisor\n1 is standing next to them with her hand on Staff 1’s shoulder.\nFrom this point in the video to the 2:55 mark Staff 2 had his hands\non Youth A’s shoulders and was performing a floor restraint on the\nground, which was consistent with interviews with both Youth A\nand various staff who were involved in the incident. Youth A\neventually got up under his own power and walked to his room\nwith Staff 2.\n• Personnel documentation for Staff 1, Staff 4 and Staff 5\nwas reviewed, and none had any discipline of concern in\n7",
    "their employment with the facility. All three staff were\ncurrent with their CPI restraint training.\n• Physical Force policy from the facility. This states that\n“staff are never to use more physical force than is\nnecessary to control a situation” and that physical force\nmay be deemed necessary in circumstances where staff\nare acting in self-defense.\n• Incident reports dated 02/09/2023 from the facility authored\nby Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4 and Supervisor 1. It was\nconfirmed that these were the only staff in the unit during\nthe time of the incident. All of the incident reports are\nconsistent and describe a similar recollection of events\nwhere Youth A escalated and eventually threw a chair at\nStaff 1 and attacked him, resulting in a physical\nmanagement that was ended by Staff 2.\n• Incident report dated 02/22/2023 from the facility. This was\nauthored by on site nursing staff that documented attempts\nto provide Youth A with medical care on 02/09/2023. At the\ntime of nursing staff’s attempts to provide care Youth A was\nstill escalated and refused their care.\nAnalysis Through interviews of youth and staff as well as documents\nreviewed there are no violations found for this rule. There was no\nevidence found of an improper restraint.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.
