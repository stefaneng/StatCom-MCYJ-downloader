I interviewed him by phone on 6/18/20. I asked IL Youth G if CA 1\npushed his head through a window. He responded “I’m good with that incident. It did\nnot happen.” Asked what did happen, IL Youth G said he and CA 1 “got in an\naltercation.” I asked him to elaborate. He responded “I don’t know much. I choose to\nlet all that stuff go in the past. Was that all you wanted?” I asked IL Youth G to\ndescribe the incident so the state can assure his future safety and that of other youth in\nthe program. He said, “I just don’t remember. I was acting a fool. Where was that\nagain? Where was it (where did it happen)?” The phone went dead. I am uncertain if\nthere was a bad connection or the youth hung up.\nChief Administrator (CA) 1 has been the Administrator for the Community Care\nOrganization Child Placing Agency since its inception in 2013. I interviewed CA 1 by\n4",
    "phone on 6/29/20. I asked if he pushed IL Youth G’s head through a window. He\nresponded “No. That did not happen.” I asked if he recalled an incident with himself\nand IL Youth G. CA 1 said, “We, um. He, um. We were having a discussion. IL Youth\nG got irate and hit me in the mouth. I just tried to stop him from hitting me. I had just\ngotten a hip replacement. We were struggling. We both landed into a glass partition\nthe Matrix Center…It’s a community center. It was my first time meeting him. He\nwalked up on me. He flinched at me and took off his jacket. I had my arms extended\nout. I stepped back. He tried to hit me with his right arm. We started to tussle and\nended up by the steps. He tried to push me down the stairs. We landed into the glass.\nHe hit me in the mouth. Former Staff 1 grabbed him…My lip was busted. IL Youth G\nwas not hurt.”\nI asked CA 1 if any other IL Youth or current employees from Community Care\nOrganization witnessed the altercation. He said no one else witnessed it. At the time of\nthe incident the youth that were originally present had already left the building.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: CA 1 stated IL Youth G physically attacked him and busted his\nlip at a community center. IL Youth G referred to the incident as\nan “altercation” and refused to provide any details. There were\nno other identifiable witnesses.\nDue to a lack of evidence, whether or not CA 1 lacks the ability\nto perform his duties as Chief Administrator cannot be\ndetermined at this time.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION 2:\nIL Youth D stabbed a man and a former IL youth after they broke into the provider\nhome on Lakewood Street in Detroit between 7am - 3pm. IL Youths J and L\ncleaned up the blood.\n5",
    "INVESTIGATION:\n*Note – Per DHHS contract, a CCO employee is required to be present in the\nprovider home between the hours of 3pm – 7am daily. The contract does not\nrequire an employee to be present from 7am – 3pm.\nIL Youth J, age 18, has resided at the provider home on Lakewood Street in Detroit for\nten months. I interviewed him by phone on 6/29/20. I asked IL Youth J if he had\nknowledge of a break-in, a stabbing or if he cleaned up any blood in the provider home.\nHe responded, “No. I’m lost. I don’t remember nothing like that.” I asked again if he\nheard about or was aware of a break-in by a former IL youth. He said, “No.”\nIL Youth D, age 17, has resided at the provider home on Lakewood Street in Detroit for\none year. He reportedly was AWOL from the home for five days prior to the interview. I\ninterviewed him by phone on 6/29/20. I asked IL Youth D if he was aware of a break-in\nby a former IL Youth or anyone else. He responded, “No. I don’t know nothing about\nthat. I don’t know nothing about that.” I asked if he was aware of a stabbing in the\nhome. IL Youth D said, “I heard something about that two weeks ago…I forgot who told\nme.” I asked if he remembered what he heard. He responded, “I do not know. I don’t\nknow. I work. I do my own thing. I got a baby. I got my girl. I be gone so long. I got\nmy own agenda.” I asked IL Youth D if he believes the provider home is a safe place\nfor IL youth to reside. He answered, “It is a safe place.”\nI interviewed Licensee Designee (LD) 1 by phone on 6/16/20. I asked if she was\naware of any break-in and/or stabbing at the provider home on Lakewood Street. She\nresponded, “No. I don’t know nothing about that. I asked if there was any blood that\nwas cleaned up at the home. She said, “No.”\nIL Youth L (Youth J’s brother), age 16, has resided at the provider home on Lakewood\nStreet in Detroit for eight months. I interviewed him by phone on 6/29/20. I asked IL\nYouth L if he was aware of a break-in or stabbing at the provider home. He hesitated.\n“I don’t know because I barely be here, but I did hear something like that.” I asked him\nto elaborate.\nIL Youth L said that someone stole his laptop, all of his shoes and clothing, and a\ntelevision belonging to the provider. He suspects a former IL youth took his items\nbecause “someone saw him (in the community) with my shoes on.” IL Youth L\nhypothesized a thief may have gained access to the home through a window with a\nbroken lock. He denied that anyone was stabbed in the home or that he cleaned up any\nblood. IL Youth L said he did not report the theft to the police, but he believes LD 1\nreported it. He did not know what day he discovered his belongings missing.\n6",
    "I re-interviewed LD 1 by phone on 6/30/20. She said IL Worker 1 informed her that IL\nYouths J and L told her their laptops missing. LD 1 did not remember when IL Worker 1\ntold her this. “I wasn’t told clothes or shoes were missing. There was a television\nmissing but I believe it happened prior to that. I’ve had five televisions come up missing\nsince 2016.” LD 1 said she believes the five television were stolen by IL youth and sold.\nShe replaces the televisions when they go missing. LD 1 said the youth are able to\nsteal the homes’ property during the hours the homes are not staffed.\nI asked LD 1 if there is a window is broken anywhere in the home on Lakewood, which I\nwas informed is a duplex. She said unidentified youth have broken off an interior\nwindow lock on the first floor and that she has had it repaired several times. She said\nthe whole window was eventually replaced and in February 2020, the lock was broken\nagain. She did not know how many days the lock remained broken. However, each\ntime it is brought to her attention, she has it repaired.\nI asked LD 1 if there are locks on the youth’s bedroom doors. She said the bedroom\ndoors do not lock for safety reasons. LD 1 added “Kids sign off that they are\nresponsible to protect their own belongings. If they have valuables, they are supposed\nto take them with them. The youth are responsible to keep the (outer) doors locked\nwhen staff are not there.”\nIL Worker 1 has been a social service worker for four months. I interviewed her by\nphone on 6/30/20. IL Worker 1 said she was aware IL Youth L’s laptop came up\nmissing. She was not sure if anyone reported this to the police.\nIL Worker 1 affirmed that IL youth at Lakewood and the other provider home locations\nfrequently destroy property. She was not aware of any televisions were stolen from\nprovider homes.\nIL Worker 1 said she believes the five provider’s homes are “very safe” for IL youth.\nAsked how she determines safety, she said she talks to the neighbors, assures that\nyouth report all unusual incidents and visits the 13 youth on her caseload in their homes\ntwice a month even though it is not required at this time due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nDuring each home visit, IL Worker 1 said she checks the basement, windows and\ndoors, and the bedrooms for drug paraphernalia. She said she does not feel the homes\nrequire 24/7 staff supervision because her “youth sleep until 11am or noon during\nCOVID and otherwise are at work or school.”\nR 400.12505 Supervision.\n(1) An agency shall provide supervision for a youth in\nindependent living consistent with the youth’s need for\nsupervision, as required by R 400.12504(2)(e).\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency is required to provide a level of supervision\nconsistent with the needs of the youth. Given the break-ins and\nthievery that is occurring outside of the time in which the house\nis staffed, the agency is not providing supervision consistent\nwith the needs of the clients, or meeting the requirement of this\nrule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nNo repeats\nADDITIONAL FINDING:\nI requested the MISACWIS person IDs and names of the IL workers assigned to IL\nYouths G, D, J and L from Jan – May 2020. There was more than one IL worker\nassigned to two of the four youth during that period. The IL workers assigned to those\ntwo youth no longer work for the agency. In fact, in addition to managing Community\nCare Organization’s four IL provider homes, LD 1 said she also temporarily assumed\nthe role of IL worker for IL Youths G and D during the months of April and May.\nThe MISACWIS social work contacts showed IL Youths G, L and J were visited in the\nprovider home by IL workers monthly. However, there was no documentation that IL\nYouth D was visited in the month of April 2020. LD 1 said she saw IL Youth D in the\nhome that month, but she did not document it as a home visit in the social work contacts\nin MISACWIS. LD 1 further reported that due to the serious COVID outbreak in the city\nof Detroit, the agency experienced a high turnover of both IL workers and provider\nhome staff (as required by DHHS contract) from March – May 2020.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12505 Supervision.\n(2) An agency shall provide the following minimum\nsupervision:\n(b) At monthly intervals, ensure that the youth is\ncomplying with the terms of the contract required by R\n400.125010, continues to reside in a safe and acceptable\nenvironment, and is managing expenditures.\nANALYSIS: There was no documentation in the MISACWIS social work\ncontacts that IL Youth D was visited by an IL worker to ensure\nthe home was safe and acceptable in April 2020.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n8",
    "CONSULTATION –\nIf youth safety is in jeopardy at any time, the IL worker or any other CCO employee\nwho becomes aware must notify the appropriate authority (i.e., law enforcement,\nchildren’s protective services, adult protective services and/or the referral source)\nimmediately. Depending on the situation, the IL worker may need to recommend or\nrequest that MDHHS move the youth to safety.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12502 Program statement.\n(2) An agency shall have and follow a current program\nstatement that includes all of the following information:\n(a) Types of living arrangements approved\n(b) Eligibility requirements for a youth, including age and\nlevel of physical, emotional, and intellectual functioning\nand youth not appropriate for the program.\n(e) Supervision\nCONSULTATION CCO’s program statement/description should clearly indicate the\ntype of living arrangement(s) offered by the agency. In this\ncase, each arrangement is a group setting that provides no adult\nsupervision between the hours of 7am – 3pm daily. The\nstatement should describe the homes’ neighborhoods and\nshared living spaces, and explain that large lockers are not\nprovided for youth to secure their belongings and that the\nyouths’ bedroom doors do not lock. The program statement\nshould be available to the referral source upon their request.\nR 400.12504 Eligibility requirements\n(1) An agency shall document the rationale for selection\nof independent living as the most appropriate\nplacement for the youth.\n(2) All of the following shall be in the case record before\na youth is placed in independent living:\n(a) How the youth meets the eligibility requirements\nfor the specific program the youth is placed\ninto.\n(b)The basis for concluding that a youth exhibits\nself-care potential.\n9",
    "(e ) An evaluation of a youth’s need for supervision\nand a plan for providing the level of supervision\ndetermined necessary.\nTECHNICAL The eligibility requirements identified in this rule are determined\nASSISTANCE by CCO (the placing agency) not by the referring agency. CCO\nmust conduct a thorough assessment of each youth prior to\naccepting and placing each youth in one of its group provider\nhomes.\nFirst CCO must determine and document the rationale for\nselecting independent living for the youth vs foster care (with a\nrelative or non-relative) or residential placement. Secondly, they\nmust determine and document the rationale for selecting a\ngroup independent living arrangement vs an independent living\narrangement with an individual appropriate home provider,\nfriend or relative.\nIf a group independent living arrangement is determined as\nmost appropriate, how the youth meets CCO’s specific program\nrequirements and the basis for concluding the youth exhibits\nself-care potential must be documented before the youth is\nplaced.\nFinally CCO must evaluate the youth for his/her individual need\nfor supervision and devise a plan to provide the level of adult\nsupervision determined necessary. This evaluation and plan\nmust also be documented.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is submitted, I recommend this agency\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nJuly 13, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10",
