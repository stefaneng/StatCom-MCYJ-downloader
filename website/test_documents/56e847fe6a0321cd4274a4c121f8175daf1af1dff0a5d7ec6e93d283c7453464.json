    "There were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP, approved on 12/22/20, was the\nresult of the 12/8/20 interim review. The agency was cited for seven licensing rule\nviolations. Their CAP implementation over the past year appears to be successful as\nthe agency only had two violations during the current review; neither of these were\nrepeat violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment dated 8/9/21 was reviewed. The assessment\naddressed prior violations of late action summaries, missing dental exams, missing\ntreatment plan signatures, and late reports. The CA cited staff turnover and work\nchanges due to COVID, as one of the main challenges over the past year. However,\nthe agency addressed these issues with increased training and support, using\ntracking systems, supervisory reviews of upcoming deadlines, utilizing monthly\nmanagement report data, and monthly quality team meetings to review barriers and\ncreate solutions. These actions appear to be benefiting the agency as there were no\nrepeat violations found during this review. The CA is confident that additional\nimprovements can be further made once the program is fully staffed.\nInterviews\nInterviews were completed with three staff on-site. Staff reported their program has\nbeen very busy, but they overall feel supported by their supervisors and program\nmanager. Staff did not have any concerns about the program.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\n5",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nAugust 26, 2021\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 26, 2021\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
