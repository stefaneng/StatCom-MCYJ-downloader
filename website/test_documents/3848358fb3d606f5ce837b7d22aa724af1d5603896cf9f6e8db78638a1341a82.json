INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Policy and procedures\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12503\nSection (2) The policies and procedures must cover at least all the\nDescription following areas:\n1",
    "(f) Amount of financial support and how it is\ndisbursed. An agency may not withhold financial\nsupport intended for the youth while the youth is\nactively involved in the program.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency is withholding Youth A's IL stipend from her, and she is\nunable to purchase food.\nInvestigation The allegation was made that the agency was inappropriately\nwithholding the independent living stipend of Youth A.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Complainant on 9/6/2024 by telephone.\nComplainant reported an alternative placement was being sought\nfor Youth A because she was not doing well in her current\nplacement and the agency was withholding Youth A's Independent\nLiving stipend payment.\nI interviewed Youth A by telephone on 11/12/2024. Youth A\nreported she is still in the same placement, but she is now doing\nwell in the placement/program. Youth A reported she is currently\nreceiving her Independent Living Stipend payments, and she has\nalso received all of her previous payments.\nI interviewed Staff 2 and Staff 3 by telephone on 11/12/2024.\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 described Youth A as currently doing well in the\nprogram/placement. Staff 2 and Staff 3 reported Youth A is\ncurrently receiving her stipend payments and all the previous\npayments that were temporarily withheld have been given to\nYouth A. Staff 3 stated the agency program includes a\ncontract/agreement with youth participants that authorizes the\nwithholding of stipend payments when a youth/participant is not in\ncompliance with program expectations included in the\nyouth/participant treatment plan/goals as a means of helping\nencourage progress and goal achievement. Staff 3 stated Youth\nA was on \"probation\" until October 1, 2024, due to Youth A being\nverbally abusive toward peers and staff and uncooperative in\ncomplying with program expectations. Staff 3 stated Youth A's\nstipend payments were temporarily withheld as a part of the\nprobation period, but Youth A was still provided food, and her\nbasic needs were being met during that time. Staff 3 stated Youth\nA is currently off probation and doing very well.\n2",
    "Documents Reviewed:\nI requested and received confirmation from Administrator 1 that\nYouth A has received Youth A's Independent Living Stipend\npayments and is currently continuing to receive those payments. I\nreceived the requested documentation confirmation from\nAdministrator 1 on 11/15/2024. The documentation received also\nincluded a copy of the independent living agreement/contract\nsigned by participants in the program to authorize the temporary\nwithholding for program noncompliance.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with the rule as determined by\nthe interviews that were completed and the documents that were\nreviewed. The interviews with staff and Youth A determined\nYouth A is current in the receipt of Independent Living Stipend\npayments. The contract/agreement signed by participants in this\nprogram authorizes this temporary withholding of payments as a\nmeans of promoting program progress and goal achievement.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nDescription suitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff treated Youth A poorly, disrespectfully.\nInvestigation Allegation was made that Staff 1 treated Youth A poorly,\ndisrespectfully, and violated confidentiality with other staff\nmembers and youth.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Staff 3 by telephone on 11/12/2024. Staff 3\ndescribed Staff 1 as being disrespectful toward Youth A by\ndescribing Youth A as \"trifling\", \"dirty\", \"messy\", and \"little girl\".\nStaff 3 reported a meeting was conducted involving youth\nparticipants in the program and staff members to discuss any\nissues involving staff and participants. I requested information\n3",
    "related to the meetings and Staff 3 stated she would refer that\nrequest to Administrator 1. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 is no longer\nemployed with the agency.\nI interviewed Youth A by telephone on 11/12/2024. Youth A\nreported she is still in the same placement, but she is now doing\nwell in the placement/program. Youth A did not report any\nmistreatment by Staff 1. Youth A did report Youth A had previous\nconflicts/disagreements with staff and peers.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by telephone on 11/12/2024. Staff 2\nconfirmed Youth A is currently doing well and making progress in\nthe program.\nAttempts to interview Staff 1 were unsuccessful and voicemail\nmessages were not able to be completed as Staff 1's voicemail\nwas not set up. A text message that was received/forwarded\nindicated Staff 1 did not feel supported by the agency and\nvoluntarily resigned.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI received interviews/meeting notes related to staff and participant\nmeetings regarding staff and youth participants\ninteractions/communications and relationships. The meetings\nwere a part of ongoing program assessments of staff and program\nparticipants evaluations of the program functions. Comments by\nsome staff and some youth made during these meetings\nperceived Staff 1 as showing favoritism to Youth A. The\nrelationship of Staff 1 with other staff members as well as program\nparticipants was one area of discussion during these meetings.\nDocumentation of Staff 1's termination of employment with the\nagency indicated it was a voluntary termination effective\n9/10/2024.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with the rule as Youth A did\nnot indicate she was mistreated by Staff 1. Nor is it a violation of\nconfidentiality when information about youth is shared amongst\nthemselves in a program meeting.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\n4",
