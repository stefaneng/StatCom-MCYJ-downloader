OT reported Youth A came to her office on\n10/16/23, reported the allegations and filled out a client’s rights\nform. OT stated Youth A told her he was escalated after a verbal\ndispute with a staff member (didn’t disclose which staff member)\nafter they searched his room. Youth A reported he went into the\nmilieu and took someone’s laptop but didn’t disclose whose laptop\nit was or what he did with the laptop. OT stated Youth A told her\nYouth B came into the milieu and told Youth A to stop being\ndisrespectful. Youth A reported Supervisor moved the table out of\nthe way so Youth A and Youth B could fight. Youth A told OT he\nput his fists up but didn’t swing at Youth B. Youth A reported he\nwas punched by Youth B. Youth A stated he had bruises and\nswollen knuckles on his hand from punching the wall by the\nbathroom because he was frustrated Supervisor wouldn’t let him\nin the bathroom to clean up. OT reported she read the fill-in log\nfrom the unit after Youth A’s complaint, and it said Youth A was\nwatching an R-rated movie on a DVD player in his room. OT\nreported there were R-rated movies in a bag in his room as well,\nwhich might have been why his belongings were searched.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 10/18/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. PM\nreported after the allegations were disclosed, Supervisor was put\non administrative leave pending investigation.

    "Youth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/18/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported\nhe was upset because Supervisor violated a boundary on\n10/15/23. Youth A reported Supervisor came into his room and\nstarted taking all his belongings for no reason. Youth A reported\nSupervisor wouldn’t listen to anything he said, and then grounded\nhim for life. Youth A reported he was trying to write a letter to his\ndad when Supervisor came into his room and started asking him\nwhat was in random bags around his room. Youth A stated he\nsaid, “why are you so nosey?”, but Supervisor took it the wrong\nway and took everything from him (i.e., letter for his father,\ntechnology, papers, and notebooks). Youth A reported when this\nhappened, he walked out of his room because he has trauma from\nhis dad taking his belongings and burning them in front of him.\nYouth A reported he was talking to Staff 1, but it didn’t help. Youth\nA reported while, he was talking to Staff 1, Youth B came up and\npunched Youth A in the face. Youth A reported Staff 1 stepped\naside, and Supervisor moved the table, so the two youth could\ncontinue fighting. Youth A reported staff are supposed to separate\nyouth who are fighting, but Staff 1 and Supervisor just sat and\nwatched. Youth A reported after Youth B punched him the first\ntime, he did it again. Youth A reported he swung back at Youth B\nand thinks he grazed his face but wasn’t sure. Youth A reported\nStaff 1 and Supervisor seemed eager to let Youth A and Youth B\nfight because they weren’t helping or saying anything. Youth A\nreported he said, “you guys are supposed to stop fights, why are\nyou just standing there watching?”, but they didn’t reply. Youth A\nreported he walked away and tried to get into the bathroom to\nwash the blood off, but it was locked, which was not normal. Youth\nA reported he asked Staff 1 and Supervisor to unlock the\nbathroom, but they didn’t respond or unlock it. Youth A reported\nhe punched the bathroom door with his right hand and then stood\nin the corner by the bookshelf in the milieu for an hour crying and\nwaiting for someone to open the bathroom. Youth A reported\nSupervisor told him to go to his room, but Youth A refused\nbecause he didn’t feel safe in his room or anywhere on the unit.\nYouth A reported when third shift staff came in (he wasn’t sure of\ntheir names), he was able to receive Ibuprofen and clean himself\nup in the bathroom. Youth A reported after he cleaned up, he went\nto bed. Youth A reported Youth B never got in trouble or received\nconsequences for fighting. Youth A reported he is not sure what\nprovoked Youth B or why he hit him.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/18/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported\nhe was in the milieu and was irritated about an unrelated situation.\n3",
    "Youth B stated Youth A came out into the milieu and was also\nirritated. Youth B reported Youth A took Supervisor’s laptop and\nwas being disrespectful towards Supervisor. Youth B reported he\ndidn’t like how Youth A was acting towards Supervisor, so while\nSupervisor and Staff 1 were by the staff office, Youth B punched\nYouth A twice and Youth A punched Youth B once. Youth B\nreported Supervisor and Staff 1 immediately came over and\nSupervisor said “stop, that’s enough”. Youth B reported Staff 1\nheld Youth B’s arm and escorted him into the staff office to\nseparate him from Youth A. Youth B reported he was told to stay\nin the staff office for a couple minutes so they could calm Youth A\ndown. Youth B reported Youth A was standing by the bathroom\ndoor, looking at the wall, but seemed calm. Youth B reported he\nwent back to his room and doesn’t know what happened after that.\nYouth B reported Supervisor did not move the table so Youth A\nand Youth B could fight. Youth B reported he was grounded from\noutings for three days for fighting.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/18/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor\nreported she conducted a room check on Youth A and he was in\nthe corner of his room with his hand and arm covering his DVD\nplayer. Supervisor reported she opened his door and said “[Youth\nA] what are you doing?” Supervisor reported Youth A responded,\n“why are you so fucking nosey?” Supervisor reported she thought\nhis reaction was suspicious, so she asked what he was watching.\nYouth A refused to allow Supervisor to see his screen and said, “I\ndon’t have to show you, this is my space”. Due to his behavior,\nSupervisor reported there was enough suspicion to justify a room\nsearch, so she and Staff 3 conducted one with Youth A present.\nSupervisor reported they ended up confiscating 87 DVDs from his\nroom (43 were PG-13 and 44 were rated R). Supervisor reported\nYouth A said he purchased them on outings and shopping trips,\nso she talked to staff about doing a better job monitoring\npurchases youth make. Supervisor stated they also found three\nbags of candy wrappers, batteries, and electrical wires. Supervisor\ntold Youth A the items would be in his restriction bins. While\nSupervisor was walking out of the room, Youth A had a bunch of\npaper in his hand. Supervisor reported Youth A threw the paper in\nher face and said, “since you want to steal my shit, here have all\nof it”. Supervisor reported Youth B came out of his room when he\nheard the commotion and yelling from Youth A and was trying to\nencourage Youth A to do the right thing, so Youth B witnessed\nYouth A hit her with the paper. Supervisor reported she told Youth\nA “I have been nothing but nice to you” and walked away.\nSupervisor reported she got her laptop and sat at a table in the\n4",
    "milieu typing notes. Supervisor reported Youth A came over to\nher, stood over her and stared at her. After a few moments,\nSupervisor said “What are you doing [Youth A]? You’re in my\nspace. Please give me space”. Supervisor reported Youth A didn’t\nmove and said “Feel my aura” over and over while staring at her.\nSupervisor reported Youth A then grabbed her laptop away from\nher, held it up in the air and said, “how does it feel for someone to\nsteal your stuff?”. Supervisor reported Youth B was in the milieu\nand said “Dude stop. You hit [Supervisor] and now took her\nlaptop?”. Supervisor reported Youth B’s tone and verbal exchange\nwith Youth A seemed positive and encouraging in nature, so she\nhad no idea Youth A was going to hit Youth B. Supervisor\nreported she retrieved her laptop out from under Youth A’s arm,\nso he couldn’t use it as a weapon, and went to put the laptop in\nthe staff office. After she walked away, Supervisor reported Youth\nB hit Youth A one time, so she ran back over and separated them.\nSupervisor reported Youth A went and stood in a corner, facing\nthe wall, and cried for a while. Supervisor reported she and Staff 3\ntried to talk to him and assess his injuries, but he wouldn’t talk to\nthem or let them see his face. Supervisor reported one time when\nshe checked on him, he said “the bible says don’t steal and to love\npeople, but you don’t do either of those, so you’re a hypocrite”.\nSupervisor reported she could tell he was still upset because he\nwasn’t reacting well to her, Staff 1, and Staff 3 when they tried\nchecking on him. Supervisor reported she tried to back off a bit\nand give him some space so he wouldn’t be triggered further.\nSupervisor stated when Staff 2 came in for third shift, Supervisor\nasked Staff 2 to try and help Youth A since he wouldn’t let anyone\nelse help him. Staff 2 asked Youth A if she could assess him or if\nhe wanted ice, but he wouldn’t respond to Staff 2 either. After a\nwhile, Supervisor said “[Youth A] can you please let someone help\nyou, even if it’s not me? Staff 2 and Staff 4 are both here. Please\nlet someone help you.” After she said that, Youth A reported he\nwanted to go into the bathroom, so she let him go into the\nbathroom to clean himself up. Supervisor reported that was the\nfirst time she was able to see his injuries, which included swelling\nand bruising around his eye. Supervisor noted Staff 2 saw Youth\nA’s hand was also swollen, which they attributed to Youth A\npunching Youth B during the altercation. Supervisor reported they\ngot him ice after he cleaned up. Supervisor reported Youth A\nasked to talk to her in the staff office, so she agreed and asked\nStaff 2 to join them. Supervisor reported Youth A apologized to\nher and said the reason he responded how he did was because\nhis dad used to come in his room, take all his stuff away from him\nand make him sit in a chair while his dad burned his belongings in\nfront of him. Supervisor reported she apologized to him for\n5",
    "triggering him and explained there needed to be communication\nbecause she didn’t know what was going on. Supervisor reported\nYouth A apologized again and said “I responded in a negative way\nand reacted wrong. I’m not mad at you and I’m not even mad at\n[Youth B] for hitting me and giving me a black eye.” Supervisor\nreported he went to bed, and everything was fine. Supervisor\nreported she checked on Youth A the next day, and everything\nseemed fine then too. Supervisor reported she didn’t see Youth A\npunch the wall or the bathroom door. Supervisor reported Youth A\nonly asked to enter the bathroom the one time right before he was\nlet in, and he was never denied access to the bathroom.\nSupervisor reported at no point did she move the table so Youth A\nand Youth B could fight each other.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 10/25/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported he was in the milieu\ncompleting a shift fill-in log when he heard something going on in\nthe hallway. Staff 1 reported he didn’t know what happened in the\nhallway or why Supervisor went into Youth A’s room initially. Staff\n1 reported Youth A came into the milieu and was escalated, so\nStaff 1 and Supervisor were monitoring him. Staff 1 reported\ninitially, Youth A went into a corner of the room and had his arms\ncrossed. Staff 1 reported then Youth A moved in front of\nSupervisor, who was sitting at a table in the milieu doing work on\nher computer. Staff 1 reported Youth A said, “I want you to feel my\naura” and then snatched Supervisor’s laptop off the table. Staff 1\nreported Youth B was in the milieu and said, “you shouldn’t be\nsnatching stuff from [Supervisor] like that”. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA got into a defensive karate-type stance and then Youth A and\nYouth B said 1-2 sentences to each other before they began\nfighting. Staff 1 reported they hit each other once or twice before\nStaff 1 stepped in the middle of them and put his arms in between\nthem to stop them. Staff 1 reported Youth A and Youth B\nseparated and continued to argue, but it didn’t get physical again.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A went into the corner by the bookshelves\nand stood there for a while. Staff 1 reported he checked on Youth\nA and asked him how he was doing, but he wouldn’t respond.\nStaff 1 reported Supervisor and Staff 2 also checked on Youth A\nand asked him how he was doing, but he wouldn’t respond to\nthem either. Staff 1 reported Youth A never asked to go into the\nbathroom after the fight, and if he would have asked, Staff 1 or\nSupervisor would have let him in. Staff 1 reported he never saw\nYouth A punch the wall or the door by the bathroom. Staff 1\nreported Supervisor never moved the table so Youth A and Youth\nB could fight.\n6",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed via phone on 10/25/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported she worked third shift on\n10/15/23 and came in around 10:30 pm. Staff 2 reported when\nshe came in, she noticed Youth A was standing facing a corner in\nthe milieu, so she asked Supervisor, Staff 1 and Staff 3 what was\ngoing on. Supervisor told Staff 2 Youth A became upset about a\nroom search she conducted, and then Youth A and Youth B got\ninto a physical altercation. After about 10-15 minutes after Staff 2\narrived, Youth A was still standing in the corner, so she went to\ncheck on him. Staff 2 reported she asked him if he needed\nanything. Staff 2 reported Youth A was turned so she couldn’t see\nhis face and he was mumbling something, but she couldn’t hear\nwhat he said. Staff 2 noticed there was some blood on the floor,\nso she told Supervisor, and Supervisor asked Staff 2 to try to get\nYouth A to talk and turn around, so they could check his injuries.\nStaff 2 asked Youth A “where are you hurt so we can help you and\nwrite up the incident report?”. Staff 2 reported Youth A turned\naround and she could see his eye was swollen and he was\ndrooling a little bit. Staff 2 reported she asked if he wanted ice, but\nhe didn’t respond. Staff 2 reported she went to get ice, but there\nwasn’t any in the freezer. Staff 2 reported she and Supervisor\nwere the only ones there at the time, and Supervisor said they had\nto wait until Staff 4 arrived before they got ice from another unit.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A finally agreed to get cleaned up, so they\nlet him into the bathroom, and he started cleaning himself up.\nWhen Staff 4 arrived shortly after, they got ice for him, and he also\ntook Ibuprofen. After Youth A was cleaned up, he asked to talk to\nSupervisor and Supervisor asked Staff 2 to come over as well.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A told Supervisor he apologized for what he\ndid and said he was sorry for overreacting because of his past\ntrauma. Staff 2 reported Supervisor explained to Youth A she was\njust trying to do her job and keep him safe. Staff 2 reported while\nshe was present, Youth A was never denied access to the\nbathroom, and she never saw him punch the wall or door.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 10/25/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported Supervisor was doing\nobservation checks because the youth were all in their rooms.\nStaff 3 reported he was cleaning up another part of the unit when\nhe heard Supervisor say they had to do a check on Youth A’s\nroom because he had items he shouldn’t have. Staff 3 and\nSupervisor conducted a room search and found contraband (i.e.,\nfood, wrappers, DVDs, electronic items). Staff 3 reported\nSupervisor reminded Youth A he knew the rules and knew he\ncouldn’t have these items. Youth A responded and called\nSupervisor a hypocrite. Staff 3 reported Youth A alleged\n7",
    "Supervisor was just coming up with rules against him, but Staff 3\nand Supervisor explained that wasn’t true because these are the\nsame rules for everyone. Staff 3 reported he took the items into\nthe milieu and sat at the table counting DVDs, and checking the\nrating on each of the DVDs to see which ones were allowed and\nwhich ones weren’t. Staff 3 reported Supervisor was sitting at a\ndifferent table in the milieu typing a report on her laptop. Staff 3\nreported Youth A was pacing back and forth for a few minutes, but\nthen went over to Supervisor and stood over her for a while, which\nwas very strange. Staff 3 stated Supervisor asked Youth A to back\nup out of her space and respect her boundaries, but instead Youth\nA stayed there and said “feel my aura, feel my aura” over and\nover. Staff 3 reported Youth A then snatched Supervisor’s laptop\noff the table and started yelling “how do you like having things\nstolen from you?”. Staff 3 reported Youth B was also in the milieu\nand told Youth A “don’t snatch the laptop from [Supervisor], you\ntrippin”. Staff 3 reported Youth B then punched Youth A once in\nthe face. Staff 3 reported it happened very quick, but Staff 1 and\nSupervisor immediately separated them. Staff 3 reported\nSupervisor took Youth B out of the milieu area and Youth A\nremained in the milieu. Staff 3 reported Youth A started saying,\n“you guys were encouraging the fight. Why are you supporting\nthis? All of you are hypocrites.” Staff 3 reported he, Staff 1 and\nSupervisor all tried to explain they had no idea that was going to\nhappen, but Youth A went and stood in the corner in the milieu.\nStaff 3 reported he, Staff 1 and Supervisor all offered to help him\nand asked if he wanted to get cleaned up, but he wouldn’t respond\nand just continued to stand in the corner. Staff 3 reported Youth A\nnever asked to go into the bathroom, and Staff 3 never saw Youth\nA punch the wall or bathroom door. Staff 3 reported Supervisor\nnever moved a table so Youth A and Youth B could fight.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Significant Event Report regarding incident on 10/15/23\nauthored by Supervisor is mostly consistent with\nSupervisor’s interview. Report notes Youth A threw the\npaper in Supervisor’s face prior to the room search, and\nwhile the room search was being conducted, Youth A was\ncalling staff racist names. Report also notes Youth A\nwalked up to Youth B and tried to punch Youth B first.\nReport does not note details about Youth A standing in a\ncorner, not responding to staff for a long period of time\nbefore getting ice and cleaning himself up.\n• Shift Fill-In Note dated 10/15/23 authored by Staff 1\nsummarized the incident. Note says after Youth A snatched\n8",
    "Supervisor’s laptop, Youth B asked Youth A not to talk to\nSupervisor in a threatening voice. Youth A walked up on\nYouth B with his hands up and attempted to hit Youth B,\nwhich then led to an altercation. Staff were able to get\nbetween them, but not before Youth A got hit in his eye. It\nnoted after the altercation, Youth A was in the milieu\nrefusing to go to bed, and talking about staff were going to\ngo to hell and talking about the bible. Note states staff were\ngiving Youth A space and monitoring his behavior.\n• Client Concern or Complaint Form dated 10/16/23 authored\nby Youth A was consistent with his interview.\n• Nursing Note dated 10/16/23 (8:00 AM) authored by Nurse\nnotes Youth A had significant swelling surrounding his right\neye as well as swelling in his right hand. Referral was made\nto Doctor to rule out concerns for any fracture or long-term\nimplication of injuries.\n• Nursing Note dated 10/16/23 (12:16 PM) and Doctor\nProgress Note dated 10/16/23 (1:07 PM) regarding visit\nwith Doctor state no fractures were suspected on Youth A’s\nface or hand and to follow up with Ibuprofen as needed.\n• Wedgwood Christian Services Behavior Management\nPolicy (rev. 2/28/18) states behaviors of youth can, without\nintervention, threaten the safety and well-being of\nthemselves and others, so staff need to be prepared to\nrespond with a variety of interventions depending on the\nsituation. Interventions can include de-escalation\nstrategies, activation of individual self-control plans,\nimplementation of safety plans, and as a last resort,\nimplementation of physical behavior management\ninterventions.\n• Staff 1 has no disciplinary records in his employee file. Staff\n1 completed Calming Children in Crisis training on 4/14/20,\nCommunication and Conflict Management Skills training on\n5/24/23, Intro to Crisis Prevention & De-Escalation training\non 4/17/20 and 6/2/23, and Crisis Prevention & De-\nEscalation training on 4/21/20, 12/29/20, 4/20/21 and\n9/25/23.\n• Supervisor has no disciplinary records in her employee file.\nSupervisor completed Calming Children in Crisis training on\n2/9/19, and Crisis Management & De-Escalation training on\n9",
    "9/3/15, 3/24/16, 9/8/16, 3/6/17, 9/7/17, 4/12/18, 9/13/18,\n3/26/19, 10/22/19, 4/21/20, 12/29/20, 4/20/21, 10/19/21,\n4/11/22, 10/10/22, 3/27/23 and 9/25/23.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. Youth B, Staff 1, Staff 3, and\nSupervisor all reported Supervisor did not move a table so Youth\nA and Youth B could fight. In addition, there is no evidence to\nsupport Youth A’s claims staff encouraged the fight rather than\nstopping it as Youth B, Staff 1, Staff 3, and Supervisor all reported\nSupervisor and/or Staff 1 stepped in between the two youth and\nstopped the altercation immediately. Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and\nSupervisor all reported Youth A was never denied access to the\nbathroom to clean up.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nNovember 15, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 21, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
