    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and\nshall include documentation of all of the following information\nprior to employment or at the time specified in this rule:\n(j) A written evaluation of the employee's performance within\n30 days of the completion of the probationary period or within\n180 days, whichever is less, and a written evaluation of the\nemployee’s performance annually thereafter.\nThree of seventeen new hire employee files reviewed lacked an evaluation completed\nby the facility within 90 days (per agency policy). The three evaluations were written by\nthe supervisor but had not yet been reviewed with the staff member over thirty days post\ncompetition. One of the six annual evaluations was not completed for the employees\nwho have been working at the facility for over a year.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2021 Interim, CAP approval date 05/14/2021\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract/Policy violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included in\nsection 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n- Staff evaluations should be completed in a timely manner. The facility was\nable to provide this consultant with the written evaluation from the supervisor,\nbut it was noted that it has not been reviewed with the staff member. These\nevaluations were still pending review after 30 days of completion. It was\ndiscussed about scheduling the evaluations timely and bringing the computer\nto the evaluation for the worker to sign off on report during the review\nmeeting.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n4",
    "- The facility was not in need of consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility had nine special investigations during this period under review with six\nresulting in corrective action plans. The non-compliances included behavior\nmanagement, restraint techniques, staff qualifications, and sufficiency of staff. The\nfacility’s corrective action plan compliance is monitored quarterly and have completed all\ncurrent corrective action plans.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nChief Administrator noted over this reporting period COVID-19 has continued to have\nan impact on the facility, primarily regarding staff turnover and recruitment. There has\nalso been a number of quarantines due to COVID-19 which has left the facility short\nstaffed with supervisors having to spend most of their time on the floor with limited\ntime to complete office duties. The facility continues to offer sign on bouses and\nreferral bonuses for current staff referring candidates. Program Manager leadership\nchanged a year ago and proper documentation and follow through has been a main\nfocus of the current Program Manager. The facility has shown improvement in\nmultiple documentation areas based on management/ leadership follow up and\nholding staff accountable. Chief Administrator reports through the corrective action\nplans the facility has seen a positive impact on the facility. They have seen positive\noutcomes with the updated Onboarding Checklist with additional Project Coordinator\naudit which has improved the onboarding process and Employee Records\ncompliance. Additionally, implementation of Director review of random Updated\nService Plans and leadership weekly walk throughs of the budling for maintenance\nand cleanliness checks has improved compliance consistency.\nInterviews:\nStaff and youth interviews were conducted during the inspection and no issues or\nconcerns were raised. Some of the youth at the facility are nonverbal youth and this\nconsultant was able to view and interact with these youth. The youth appeared to be\nin positive spirits by laughing and clapping their hands. Staff were viewed meeting the\nneeds of the children and interacting with them on a one-to-one basis. The staff all\nreported feeling supported by direct supervisors as well as administration.\n5",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\n04/19/22\n________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 19, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
