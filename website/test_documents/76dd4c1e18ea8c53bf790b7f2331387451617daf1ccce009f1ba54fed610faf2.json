Youth A stated she has\n“memory loss” but will do her best to recount the concerns with\nplacement at Vassar House. Youth A said staff at Vassar would\n“beat kids up during restraints” stating they would “lift kids head up\nand slam them to the ground”. Youth A said she was restrained for\nattempting to fight a peer and was brought outside by Staff 5, near\nthe front door, and Staff 5 shoved her finger on the outside of her\nneck for a second which made her very scared. Youth A said Staff\n1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 were all present and watched this\noccur however no youth were outside at the time. Youth A said\nStaff 5 said to her “if you do not stop, I am going to kill you”. Youth\nA said she did not tell anyone about this incident. Youth A said this\noccurred two years ago in the Fall. Youth A said there were no\nother times like this with Staff 5.\nYouth A said Staff 3 placed her in a restraint and she resisted so\nStaff 3 slammed her head back to the floor which gave her a sharp\nand heavy pain that lasted a day.

Youth A said Staff 1, Staff 2,\nand Staff 4 all witnessed this event and did nothing to stop it.\nYouth A said she would try to get out of the unit and Staff 2, Staff\n3, and Staff 4 would slap, punch, and hit her. Youth A said she had\nbruises on her legs, arms, back, and stomach from this. Youth A\nsaid none of the staff would say anything, they would just hit her.\nYouth A said this occurred multiple times and she never told\nanyone about it. Youth A said these incidents took place on unit 2\nand “all youth were present” however she was not able to\nremember any youth’s names.\nYouth A was interviewed via TEAMS on March 20, 2024, in\ncollaboration with the MDHHS worker and Law Enforcement.\nAs the interview began, Youth A made the statement “I have\nmemory loss” but did not elaborate further on this. At times during\nthe interview Youth A was very scattered and would be difficult to\nfollow as she would change who she was talking about and who\nwas present when events occurred. Youth A said she was\npreviously placed at Vassar House and while there had her head\nslammed during restraints. Youth A at first said Staff 1, Staff 2,\n3",

Youth A said Staff 2 kept\npressure on her forehead for the remainder of the restraint. Youth\nA said during the restraint she “fell asleep for about twenty\nminutes”, stating she knew it was twenty minutes because she\nasked the staff what time it was, fell asleep and when she awoke\nthe staff were still holding her and she asked what time it was\nagain, they told her the time, and it had been twenty minutes.\nYouth A said she calmed down and was let go. Youth A said\nanother incident occurred in the back of unit 2, maybe in the Fall,\na couple days after Staff 2 slammed her head.
