This includes attempted and missed face-to-face\ncontacts.\n4",
    "Five of six foster care files held face-to-face contacts that were not entered into\nMiSACWIS within the required timeframe.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED:\n3/5/21 Interim, CAP approved 4/21/21\n1/31/20 Renewal, CAP approved 3/9/20\nFOM 801-03 Medical Passports\nAn updated medical passport is provided to:\n• Participating legal parents if the child is a temporary court\nward. Quarterly, while in out-of-home placement. At\nreunification. Subsequent medical passports are not required\nafter reunification.\n• The child’s foster care provider: At or prior to each placement.\nQuarterly.\nTwo of six foster care files did not have quarterly updated medical passports\nprovided to the required case participants.\nFile one: The August 2021 passport did not have signatures, or any indication it was\nprovided to the parent or foster parent.\nFile two: the 4/19/21 and 7/16/21 passports did not have the foster parent signature,\nor indicate it was provided to the foster parent.\nFOM 722-08 Case Service Plans\nThe supervisor must approve all case service plans within 14\ndays of the end of the report period.\nOne of eighteen service plans was not approved by the supervisor within the\nrequired timeframe. The 4/20/21 USP was approved on 5/5/21.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n The agency was advised that review of updated service plans and medical\npassports via video conference was an acceptable alternative when face-to-\nface contact was not possible due to illness. The agency was advised to\ndocument this review, then obtain signatures electronically, or in person when\nable.\n The agency was advised to assure follow-up is completed with DCWL for all\nadult household member clearances. The agency should contact their\nconsultant for assistance when a clearance has not been returned timely.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\n5",
    "The agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP, approved 4/21/21, was the\nresult of the 3/5/21 interim review. During this review there were very few violations;\nonly one repeat violation was found. The agency was found to have successful\nimplementation of the 2021 CAP.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment, dated 2/4/22, was reviewed and discussed\nduring the entrance meeting. The agency reported successful implementation of the\nCAP without significant barriers. The agency has reviewed the CAP monthly among\nthe leadership team and reviewed data to assess compliance. Supervisors are also\nutilizing “intentional” supervision to review compliance with staff.\nThe agency reported working with other branches of Bethany Christian Services\ncollaboratively to share best practice information and problem solve. The agency\ncontinues to use the Monthly Management Report, Book of Business, and Info View.\nThe Program Manager provides a breakdown of the information to supervisors to\naddress any low compliance issues. Supervisors reported that timely entry of case\ncontacts is still challenging at times, due to staff turn-over, new staff, and a lack of\ntime for supervisors to diligently follow up and monitor compliance. However, they\ncontinue to strategize to address this area. In addition, the agency has focused on\nsupport and retention of foster parents over this past year, in an effort to maintain\nplacements.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted with two agency staff. Both staff reported having no\nconcerns about the agency. Both staff stated they have excellent supervisors that\nprovide help and support as needed. Neither staff had any suggestions regarding\nimprovements that could be made.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety alert:\nDuring the 10/28/21 home visit to an unlicensed relative, the analyst found the home\ndid not have a working smoke detector, an alarm for the door exiting to the pool, and\nthere was a blanket over the crib railing. During the visit the caregiver removed the\nblanket.\nResolution:\nOn 10/29/21 the foster care worker visited the home and reviewed safe sleep\nrequirements with the caregiver. The foster care worker also purchased and installed\ndoor alarms for the pool. The alarms were tested by the worker and confirmed to\nwork. The foster care worker observed the caregiver’s installation of a smoke\ndetector and carbon monoxide detector. Both were tested and confirmed to work.\n6",
    "The worker provided photos of the safe sleep compliant crib, smoke and CO\ndetectors, and door alarms to DCWL on 10/29/21.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued\na renewal of their regular license.\n_ _______________February 25, 2022__________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 28, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
