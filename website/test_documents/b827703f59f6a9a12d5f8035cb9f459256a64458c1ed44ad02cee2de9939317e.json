Staff and a resident were interviewed. Documents were also\nreviewed. What follows is information obtained from the aforementioned sources.\n2",
    "On September 28, 2021, the Vice President of Treatment Programs was notified on\nsite of the complaint and the initiation of a special investigation.\nOn September 28, 2021, the Program Supervisor of the DHHS referring office was\nnotified of the complaint and that a special investigation had been initiated.\nEach of the four incidents, staff interviewed, and documents reviewed, will be\naddressed separately for clarity.\nIncident # 1. Incident #1 occurred on September 21, 2021.\nOn November 29, 2021, and December 28, 2021, Staff 1 was interviewed. Staff 1 is\na direct care Youth Specialist. Staff 1 reported that on the date of the incident Youth\nA, had become disruptive while in classroom of Ashmun school. Youth A had\nclimbed on top of a classroom desk and refused to get down when directed and\nbegan swearing at Staff 1. Staff 1 reported that when Youth A refused to get down\nfrom the desk she took hold of Youth A’s hand and Youth A hopped down from the\ndesk but then climbed back up onto the desk, refusing to get down. Staff 1 reported\nthat Youth A was not standing on the desk but crouched on all fours. Staff 1 reported\nthat she felt it was a safety issue for Youth A to remain on top of the desk. Staff 1\nreported that she then asked the classroom teacher to take the rest of the residents\nout of the classroom. Youth A then got down from the table with a Level 1 extended\narm hold initiated by Staff 1. Staff 1 reported that Youth A then began spitting on her\nand per her safety plan initiated a benevolent restraint. Staff 1 reported that she\ncould not recall if Youth A had attempted to hit her or not. Staff 1 reported that when\nshe then initiated the one person restraint Youth A dropped her body weight and\nStaff 1 released her from the restraint. Staff 1 reported that Youth A was restrained\nagain when she took hold of a piece of a window blind and was trying to hit staff with\nit as well as trying to kick staff.\nStaff 1 was asked, not specific to the incident described above, but in general, why a\nsecond staff person would take hold of a Youth’s other arm thus placing a youth in a\ntwo person Level 1 extended arm hold. Staff 1 reported that the hold on the second\narm prevents Youth A from hitting staff.\nOn November 29. 2021, Staff 2, a Youth Specialist, was interviewed. Staff 2\nreported that when she entered the classroom Youth A was down from the table and\nshe tried to de-escalate Youth A. Staff 2 reported that she approached Youth A from\nbehind and took hold of Youth A’s arms and attempted to rotate her away from the\nstaff she was spitting on. Staff 2 reported that Youth A pulled away from her and\nbegan swearing and resumed spitting and swearing at staff. Staff 2 reported that she\nattended to the rest of the youth, who had been removed from the classroom, as\nStaff 1 and Staff 3 restrained Youth A.\n3",
    "On November 22, 2021, and December 28, 2021, Staff 3, a Youth Specialist, was\ninterviewed. Staff 3 reported that when she entered that classroom Youth A was\nescalated and was kicking at staff and spitting. Staff 3 reported that proximity control\nwas attempted to prevent Youth A from kicking staff. Proximity control is described\nby staff as not placing hands on but blocking a youth from exiting a room’s doorway\nor standing in front of a youth who may be attempting to engage another youth or\nstaff in an aggressive manner. Staff 3 reported that a two person Level 1 extended\narm hold was initiated by herself and Staff 1 and then transitioned into a benevolent\nrestraint.\nOn December 1, 2021, Staff 4, a Youth Specialist, was interviewed. Staff 4 reported\nthat when he entered the classroom youth were exiting except for Youth A who was\nescalated. Staff 4 reported that Youth A was grabbing pencils and throwing them as\nStaff 1 was trying to deescalate Youth A. Staff 4 reported that Youth A was trying to\nexit the classroom and he stood in front of doors preventing her from doing so. Staff\n4 reported at one point Youth A had ripped window blinds partially off and was trying\nto use a piece of the blind to hit him. Staff 4 reported that Youth A was then placed\nin a benevolent restraint.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nIncident Report dated September 21, 2021, was reviewed. Staff 1 acknowledged\nthat she wrote the incident report. The incident report states in part, “{Youth A}\nstarted spitting in {Staff 1’s} face, per her safety plan that {Staff 5} created, {Staff 1}\nattempted a Benevolent Restraint at 12:21pm.” The incident report further states,\n“Youth A continued to kick, {Staff 1} and {Staff 3} transitioned into a Level 1\nextended arm hold at 12:23pm.”\nIncident # 2. Incident # 2 occurred on September 22, 2021.\nOn September 22, 2021, and November 22, 2021, the Finance and Quality Program\nManager was interviewed. The Finance and Quality Program Manager reported the\nfollowing. On September 22, 2021, Youth A had left Hainley House and was sitting\ndown in the administrative parking lot. The Finance and Quality Program Manager\nreported that there was concern for the safety of Youth A as she was sitting in the\nparking lot near where the driveway to the parking lot rises up a hill. The Finance\nand Quality Program Manager reported that delivery trucks come up the driveway at\nspeeds that are not always safe or appropriate and despite speed limit postings. The\nFinance and Quality Control Manager reported that Youth A was refusing to leave\nthe parking lot so a Level 1 extended arm escort on both arms was initiated by\nherself and Staff 3 to escort Youth A out of the parking lot and into Leppien House.\nThe Finance and Quality Program Manager reported that Staff 6, a Residential\nTeam Supervisor, also provided additional support. The Finance and Quality\nProgram Manager reported that Youth A became assaultive, kicking and stomping\non her feet and Youth A was then transitioned into a benevolent restraint and then to\nan Aegis safety position.\n4",
    "The Finance and Quality Control Manager was asked why a two person Level 1\nextended arm hold would be used. She reported that control of Youth A’s free arm is\nto prevent Youth A from hitting staff or others. The Finance and Quality Control\nManager reported that a youth has freedom of movement when in the Level 1\nextended arm hold, specifically that a youth can walk freely and to wherever.\nOn November 22, 2021, and December 28, 2021, Staff 3 was interviewed, Staff 3\nreported that Youth A had ran out of Leppien House and into the administrative\nparking lot. Staff 3 reported that she followed Youth A into the parking lot area. Staff\n3 reported that traffic and cars are an issue in that area of the parking lot. Staff 3\nreported that she and the Finance and Quality Control Manager initiated a two arm\nLevel 1 extended are escort to remove Youth A from the parking lot for her safety.\nStaff 3 reported that she switched out the hold on Youth A with Staff 6 because she\nwas losing her grip on the arm of Youth A. Staff 3 reported that once inside Leppien\nHouse Youth A escalated further and was assaultive and was subsequently\nrestrained.\nOn September 28, 2021, and November 22, 2021, Staff 6, was interviewed. Staff 6\nreported that he observed Staff 3 and the Finance and Quality Control Manager had\nplaced an extended Level 1 extended arm hold on Youth A in the administrative\nparking lot of the facility. Staff 6 reported that he assisted with the Level 1 extended\narm hold and escorting Youth A out of the parking lot and into Leppien House. Staff\n6 reported that Youth A was restrained inside the house when she became\nassaultive.\nOn September 28, 2021, and December 13, 2021, Youth A was interviewed\nregarding the incident. Youth A is a 11 year old female. Youth A reported that she\nwas sitting in the facility parking lot and Staff 6 took hold of her to stand and walked\nher back to Leppien House. Youth A could not provide any other details.\nObservation of parking lot and area where the incident occurred: I observed,\nwith the Finance and Quality Control Manager, the area where Youth A had been\nsitting in the administrative parking lot. Youth A was sitting near the top of the\ndriveway hill as it enters the parking lot. From the bottom of the hill into the parking\nlot it could be difficult to see a child or person sitting on the pavement.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nIncident Report dated September 22, 2021, was reviewed. The incident report\ndocuments that Youth A was sitting in the administrative parking lot refusing to leave\nand re-enter Leppien House. The Finance and Quality Control Manager and Staff 3\nplaced Youth A in a two person Level 1 extended arm hold to escort her from the\nparking lot to Leppien House.\n5",
    "Incident # 3. Incident # 3 occurred on September 23, 2021.\nOn November 22, 2021, and December 28, 2021, Staff 3 was interviewed, Staff 3\nreported that Youth A had left Hainley House and was able to enter Ashmun\nAcademy. Staff 3 reported that Youth A was swearing and disrupting school and she\nplaced Youth A in a Level 1 extended arm hold to escort her out of the school. Staff\n3 reported that Staff 7 assisted by placing Youth A’s other arm in the Level 1\nextended arm hold. Staff 3 was asked why two staff would be needed to escort\nYouth A. Staff 3 reported that Youth A can be assaultive and the second arm hold is\nto prevent Youth A from assaulting staff. Staff 3 reported that Youth A was then\nplaced into a benevolent restraint as she was kicking staff.\nOn September 28, 2021, and December 13, 2021, Youth A was interviewed\nregarding the incident. Youth A reported that she was restrained by Staff 3 because\nshe ran into the school when she was not supposed to be there.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nIncident report dated September 23, 2021, was reviewed. The incident report\ndocuments that Youth A was placed in a two person Level 1 extended arm hold to\nescort her from the classroom to prevent her from disturbing other youth in the\nschool classroom.\nIncident # 4. Incident # 4 occurred on September 25, 2021.\nOn November 22, 2021, Staff 8 was interviewed. Staff 8 reported Youth A was in the\nstaff office and was refusing to follow directives to exit the office. Staff 8 reported\nthat she could not remember if Youth A was attempting to get something in the office\nto self-harm with. Staff 8 reported that she and Staff 1 placed Youth A in a two\nperson Level 1 extended arm escort to remove her from the office. Staff 8 reported\nthat Youth A was released once out of the office and she began running towards unit\ndoors and was attempting to assault staff and was placed in a benevolent restraint\nby Staff 1. Staff 8 was asked if the Level 1 extended arm escort is restrictive, and\nshe acknowledged that it is.\nOn November 29, 2021, and December 28, 2021, Staff 1 was interviewed regarding\nthe incident. The incident report was read for Staff 1 for a review of the incident.\nStaff 1 reported that she could not remember what Youth A was doing in the staff\noffice but acknowledged that a two person Level 1 extended arm escort was used to\nremove Youth A from the staff office. Youth A was released from the escort and she\nbegan running towards unit doors and at one point was trying to hit Staff 8 and was\nsubsequently placed in a benevolent restraint.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nIncident report dated September 25, 2021, was reviewed. The incident report\nstates in part, “Due to previous incidents and her safety plan along with safety\n6",
    "concerns (she has been trying to bust down the doors to the office). {Staff 1} gave\n{Youth A} choices either to walk out of the office on her own or be escorted out of\nthe office. {Youth A} refused and told staff to both fuck off. {Staff 1} and {Staff 8}\nplaced {Youth A} in a Level 1 extended arm escort at 5:11pm and escorted her out\nof the office.”\nEagle Village Sherk House Behavior Support Plan. The support plan for Youth A,\ndated August 23, 2021, was reviewed. The plan states, in part, the following:\n“4. If {Youth A} begins to pick up rocks, demonstrates she is beginning to take her\nclothes off, or is within 20 feet of any building or vehicle staff are to utilize the\nfollowing immediately;\na. Mirror and matching\nb. Use an escort\nc. Place in the Therapeutic restraint.\nOn December 14, 2021, Staff 5, the therapist for Youth A, was interviewed. Staff 5\nacknowledged that she created the behavior support plan for Youth A. Staff 5\nreported that the plan is to prevent property destruction and self harm. Staff 5\nreported that glass from broken windows is a safety concern and therefore the plan\nstipulates preventing Youth A from getting within 20 feet of vehicles or buildings\nwhere she can throw rocks at windows. Staff 5 reported that placing Youth A in a\ntherapeutic restraint is the last resort option. Staff 5 reported that a restraint is\njustified if Youth A begins to take her clothes off. Staff 5 reported that spitting is not\njustification for a restraint.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(4) The written policy shall only permit the licensee to\nrestrain a child for the following circumstances:\n(a) To prevent injury to the child, self-injury, or injury to\nothers.\n(b) As a precaution against escape or truancy.\n(c) When there is serious destruction of property that\nplaces a child or others at serious threat of violence\nor injury if no intervention occurs.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: Incident # 1. Staff 1 reported in the original interview on\nNovember 29, 2021, that she initiated a restraint of Youth A as\nYouth A had begun spitting on her. In a subsequent interview\nStaff 1 could not recall if Youth A had become assaultive prior to\nthe restraint. The incident report written by Staff 1 documents\nthat a restraint was initiated by Staff 1 when Youth A began\nspitting. The restraint was unjustified as harm to self and others\nwas not present.\nIncident # 2. The Finance and Quality Control Manager and\nStaff 3 reported that Youth A was placed in a Level 1 extended\narm escort to remove her from an area of the administrative\nparking due to safety concerns regarding vehicle traffic. I\nobserved the area where the incident occurred and Youth A\nsitting on the pavement in that area presented a safety concern.\nThe restraint was justified for safety reasons.\nIncident # 3. Staff 3 and Staff 7 initiated a two person Level 1\nextended arm hold to remove Youth A from the Ashmun\nacademy where Youth A had gained entrance. Staff 3 reported\nthat Youth A was disruptive and swearing while in the school.\nThe incident report indicates that Youth A was removed from the\nschool using the two person hold as she was disruptive. Staff 3\nreported that the two person extended arm hold is used as\nYouth A can be assaultive. Youth A was not presenting a safety\nconcern when she was placed in the two person extended arm\nhold. The restraint was unjustified.\nIncident # 4. Youth A was placed in a two person Level 1\nextended arm hold by Staff 1 and Staff 8 to remove her from the\nstaff office. Staff 1 and Staff 8 could not recall if Youth A was\nengaging in self-harm behaviors which required the hold. Staff 8\nreported that the escort hold is restrictive.\nDuring this investigation Staff 1, Staff 3, and the Finance and\nQuality Control Manager reported that control of both arms of\nYouth A is used to prevent her from hitting. The incident report\ndocuments that Youth A was placed in the two person Level 1\nextended arm hold to remove her from the office. There is no\nevidence that Youth A was engaging in harm to self or others\nwhen she was placed in the extended arm hold. The restraint\nwas unjustified.\nThe staff control of the second arm of Youth A in anticipation of\nYouth A becoming assaultive ceases to be an escort and is a\n8",
    "restraint. Anticipating Youth A becoming assaultive as a reason\nfor the restraint lacks justification for the restraint.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nWhile the facility’s behavior management model terms the two\nperson hold as an escort, if it is not permitting the youth to have\nfree movement of their body, it is by Act 116 definition, a\nrestraint. Therefore, staff should be trained that it is not the\nterminology that dictates whether a hold is written up as a\nrestraint, but the act of restricting the youth’s movement. This\nwill ensure that when staff go hands on it is documented\ncorrectly.\nAdditional technical assistance was provided regarding Youth\nA’s safety plan.\nThe plan states, in part, the following:\n“4. If {Youth A} begins to pick up rocks, demonstrates she is\nbeginning to take her clothes off, or is within 20 feet of any\nbuilding or vehicle staff are to utilize the following\nimmediately;\na. Mirror and matching\nb. Use an escort\nc. Place in the Therapeutic restraint.\nThe way this is written implies that staff can use a., b., or c if\nYouth A is exhibiting the behaviors outlined, which some staff\nbelieved to be the case. It was reported that the therapist\nintended this to be a progressive list, not for staff to choose\nwhich one to use. The rule allowance for use of restraint was\nreviewed and they were encouraged to remind staff of the rule\nrequirements and to reword the safety plan to comply with the\nrules and create less confusion for staff, in addition to retraining\nthe staff on the safety plan expectations.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2021C0116035, Corrective Action Plan approved\nSI 2021C0223004 (Cited as Rule 1), Corrective Action Plan\napproved\nSI 2020C223051 (Cited as Rule 1), Corrective Action Plan\napproved\n9",
