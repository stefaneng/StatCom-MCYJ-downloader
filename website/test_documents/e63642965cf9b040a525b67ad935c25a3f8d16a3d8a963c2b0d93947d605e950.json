Whenever there is a youth outside by themselves,\nstaff must keep that youth in their eyesight at all times.\nThis can be accomplished by looking through a window,\nwithout multitasking that has the potential to distract staff\nfrom maintaining 100% eyes on.\n• Eagle Village Incident Report dated 4/15/2023 for Youth B:\nYouth B was sitting with another youth by the fire pit\noutside. Staff 1 could see the two youth from the\nmedication cart window. When Staff 1 locked up from\ngetting medications, the two youth were gone.

Youth A is to be the only youth in the bathroom\nwhen he showers or needs to use the bathroom, is not\nallowed in any other youth’s bedrooms and no youth in his\nbedroom, not to be alone with any youth, conversations\n4",
    "with other youth monitored by staff at all times, and should\nbe seated next to a staff or in direct eye contact of a staff\nduring transportation in a vehicle.\n• Written recap of Youth A’s statement obtained by Eagle\nVillage was consistent with Youth A’s interview.\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: Staff 1 does not have any discipline\nin his personnel file.
