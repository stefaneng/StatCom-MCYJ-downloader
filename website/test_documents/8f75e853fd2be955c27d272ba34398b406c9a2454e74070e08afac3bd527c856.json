    "Interviews\nYouth K, age 15, is a CMO youth who has been at Crossroads for five months. I\ninterviewed her on-site at the facility on 9/28/21. Youth K said about noon on 9/18/21,\nshe felt a hard spot on her right thigh that was painful. Around 2pm, Staff 1 transported\nher to Independent Point Urgent Care in Clarkston. Urgent Care medical staff\nadministered antibiotics intravenously, made an incision on her thigh, bandaged the\nwound, prescribed Cephalexin 500mg (antibiotic) every 8 hours for 10 days to begin on\n9/19/21 and provided hand-written discharge instructions.\nOn the drive back to Crossroads from Urgent Care, Youth K said she started\nexperiencing “chills.” In response, Staff 1 continued to drive her directly to St. Joseph\nMercy Hospital in Pontiac where she was seen by Physician 1. Youth K said the\nhospital staff drew a circle around the abscess, gave her Motrin and told her to return if\nthe redness spread outside of the circle. Youth K said she left the emergency room\nfeeling better and went straight to bed when she returned to Crossroads.\nOn Sun 9/19/21, Youth K said Staff 1 noticed her face was red. Staff 1 took her\ntemperature. looked at her incision beneath the bandage and observed the redness had\nspread well beyond the circle. By this time, Youth K said she had still not received her\nprescribed antibiotic that was scheduled to begin that morning. Staff 1 immediately\ntransported her back to St. Joseph’s and she was admitted by Physician 1. Youth K\nremained on the pediatric unit from 9/19/21 – 9/22/21.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 9/28/21. She has worked at Crossroads for two months. Staff\n2 worked on 9/18/21 from 8am – 2pm. Around 1pm, she said Youth K complained of a\nhard bump on her thigh that sounded to her like an infection. Staff 2 reported this to\nSupervisor 1 and left the facility as her shift had ended.\nSupervisor 1 who worked on 9/18/21 could not be interviewed as she is no longer\nemployed by the facility.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 on 9/28/21. On 9/19/21, her shift began at 2pm. Supervisor\n2 said she immediately began looking for the hard copy of Youth K’s antibiotic\nprescription she thought had been misplaced. Supervisor 2 said that at that time, she\nwas unaware no paper copy existed, and that Urgent Care had sent an e-script directly\nto LS Pharmacy, which she knew was closed on weekends. She said LS pharmacy is\nthe pharmacy Crossroads routinely uses to fill prescriptions. When prescriptions need\nfilling on weekends, she said a supervisor usually reminds the staff to ask medical\npersonnel to have them sent to Walgreen’s which is open. Around 4:30pm, Supervisor\n2 said she was informed that Youth K was not feeling well so she sent her 1 back to the\nhospital with Staff 1.\n4",
    "I interviewed Clinical Director (CD 1) on 9/28/21 and again collaboratively with\nGovernment Worker 1 on 10/1/21 by phone. He has worked at Crossroads for 25\nyears. On 9/18/21 due to a staff shortage, he said he assumed the role of campus\nSupervisor while (former) Supervisor 1 worked as Direct Care staff. CD 1 said he was\nat the facility and in charge when Youth K returned from Urgent Care and the hospital\nwith the discharge instructions.\nCD 1 said Crossroads does not employ a nurse. He admitted he did not personally\nread Youth K’s discharge instructions, but he was aware of them because Staff 4 told\nthem what they said.\nWhen Youth K and Staff 1 returned from the medical visits on Saturday night, CD 1 said\nhe knew Urgent Care sent an “e-script” to LS pharmacy, but he also thought they wrote\na paper prescription. At that time, he learned “our pharmacy” was closed on weekends,\nwhich he said surprised him. “It was a revelation to me…Evidently this was known by\nmy staff. I was under the impression we also had a paper prescription (that had been\nmisplaced).” Rather than call Urgent Care to request a second e-script be sent to a\npharmacy that could fill it timely, Crossroads staff continued to search for a paper\nprescription that did not exist. Consequently, Youth K never received her antibiotics\nscheduled to begin on Sunday morning.\nI interviewed Staff 1 by phone on 9/30/21. She has worked at Crossroads for three\nmonths. Previously she was employed at an urgent care facility. Staff 1 said she\nworked 2pm – 10pm on 9/18/21 and a double shift from 2pm on 9/19 to 7am on 9/20.\nStaff 1 said on 9/18/21 at 2:20pm she transported Youth K to Urgent Care and St.\nJoseph’s hospital. They returned to Crossroads at 7:30pm. While at Urgent Care, Staff\n1 said Supervisor 1 instructed her by phone to “tell Urgent Care to send it (prescription)\nto LS Pharmacy.” Upon returning to Crossroads, Staff 1 said “I told Supervisor 1 and\nCD 1 that Youth K’s e-script was sent to LS pharmacy. They (CD 1 and Supervisor 1)\nwere aware that pharmacy was closed. I told them it was electronically sent and there\nwas no paper prescription.”\nAt 2pm on 9/19/21 when she started her shift, Staff 1 said she spoke with CD 1 and\nStaff 3. “I told them to call Urgent Care and get the prescription resent to another\npharmacy. I know because I used to work at an Urgent Care. They said they’d take\ncare of it.” That day around 5:00pm, Staff 1 said she noticed Youth K’s face was red.\nStaff 1 checked her for a fever and her temperature was 102.4 degrees. Staff 1 said\nshe unwrapped the youth’s bandage and observed the “redness” had spread outside\nthe circle. “I told Supervisor 2 she needed to go to the hospital.” Records indicate Staff\n1 transported Youth K to the hospital around 6:15pm.\nAt the hospital visit on 9/19/21, Staff 1 said she informed Physician 1 that Youth K had\nnot received any antibiotics yet. According to Staff 1, “he said I’ll have to admit her. It’s\n5",
    "going to get worse. If she had taken the antibiotics, it would’ve been better, not worse.”\nStaff 1 said she stayed with Youth K overnight at the hospital and was relieved by\nanother staff person the next morning.\nI interviewed Staff 4 jointly with Government Worker 1 by phone. She has worked at\nthe facility for 11 years. Staff 4 normally works on another unit, but on 9/18/21, she\nworked on Youth K’s unit. When Staff 1 and Youth K returned from Urgent Care and\nthe hospital, she heard Staff 4 mention that Youth K had a prescription to be filled. “We\ntypically use LS pharmacy. Knowing LS pharmacy was closed on weekends, “I asked\nCD 1 where he wanted ‘this one’ to be filled. “I assumed the prescription was there…I\ndidn’t have an actual (paper) prescription. I wrote the info in the business (medical)\nlog.” I asked Staff 4 if she read the hand-written discharge instructions. She said she\ndid not read them and did not see anyone else read them.\nMedical Documentation\nNecessary Follow Up Care hand-written from Independent Point Urgent Care date\n9/18/21 indicated the following:\n Keep dressing in place for 24 hours\n Once removed, cleanse the area with anti-bacterial soap and water 2-3\ntimes daily – may apply a topical anti-infective after cleansing\n Apply warm compresses to the area 2 – 3 times daily\n Monitor closely for any increased redness, warmth or pain/swelling and\nseek immediate medical care\n Cephalexin 500mg every 8 hours for 10 days – START 9/19/21\nThe following was noted in Youth K’s Crossroads health record by Staff 1:\n9/18/21 – “Taken to urgent care for abscess on leg. Abscess was drained and\nCephalexin 500mg was prescribed for 10 days. Youth was referred to hospital for\nuncontrollable shaking and examined. (At hospital) Abscess was circled with marker\nand staff was told to watch to make sure redness does not spread. Youth was told to\nstart antibiotics on 9/19/21 and she should see improvement. If not, come back to ER\nfor IV meds.”\nThe following was noted in Youth K’s Crossroads health record by an\nunidentified staff person:\n9/19/21 – “Was taken to ER at St. Joe’s with 102 temperature due to infection in right\nthigh. Was admitted and transferred up to pediatric floor.”\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nANALYSIS: Crossroads staff did not read or follow Youth K’s Urgent Care\nhand-written instructions received on 9/18/21. They did not fill\nher prescription in a timely manner and did not monitor her\nclosely for increased redness, warmth or swelling until 5pm the\nnext evening.\nTechnical Assistance\nWhen a youth returns from Urgent Care, the hospital or any\nmedical appointment, all instructions should be read\nimmediately by a supervisor on duty. The supervisor should\ndistribute any instructions to all staff potentially responsible for\ncaring for that youth until he/she receives follow-up medical\ncare. If the youth is prescribed medication, the supervisor on\nduty should assure the prescription is filled in a timely manner.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nI was the Licensing Consultant assigned to Crossroads when Youth K was admitted to\nthe hospital on 9/19/21. Crossroads did not notify me of the hospitalization within 24\nhours.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4150 Incident reporting.\n(1) Any incident resulting in serious injury of a resident or\nillness requiring inpatient hospitalization, shall be reported\nto the parent/ legal guardian, responsible referring agency,\nand the licensing authority as soon as possible, but not\nmore than 24 hours after the incident.\nANALYSIS: Crossroads did not notify the licensing authority of Youth K’s\nhospitalization on 9/19/21 within 24 hours.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nA review of Youth K’s room check log dated 9/19/21 indicated eye-on checks of the\nyouth were completed every fifteen minutes on the quarter hour rather than at\nvariable intervals not to exceed fifteen minutes.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise out of the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval,\neye-on checks of residents.
