    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\nSection (2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each child\nDescription and parent or parents, as follows:\n(b) Within 120 calendar days after the initial removal and at least\nonce every 90 calendar days thereafter.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency is late in completion of Updated Service Plans (USP).\nInvestigation On 6/4/25 Complainant reported a review hearing was postponed\ndue to Foster Care Worker not submitting documents as\nrequested, including a service plan that was reportedly not\ncompleted on time. Follow-up contact occurred with Complainant\non 6/4/25. No additional information was provided.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was contacted by email on 6/26/25.\nFCW reported being assigned to the case in December 2024. Due\nto one youth entering care after his siblings, the service plans\nwere separated in the MiSACWIS database. Due to a\nmisunderstanding by FCW, two separate service plans were\ncompleted when they should have been merged into one service\nplan for that review period. On 6/30/25 an interview was\ncompleted with FCW via video call. FCW stated she completed\nher first service plan on the case in February 2025 and the second\nservice plan in April 2025. FCW indicated she believed all service\nplans were completed timely, although there was some confusion\nregarding the dates at the beginning of the case, due to the plans\ninitially being separated for the youth.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was contacted by email on\n6/26/25. On 7/1/25 an interview was completed with FCS via video\ncall. FCS confirmed there was an error at the beginning of the\ncase, due to the children in the family having separate service\nplans that should have been merged. The first service plan in\nFebruary 2025 was completed timely but needed to be redone to\ninclude all of the children. This resulted in the USP being\ncompleted past the due date.\nParent was interviewed by phone on 7/16/25. Parent reported\nFCW did a good job staying in contact and communicating.\nHowever, FCW was behind on a few things that impacted\nprogress on the case as court was postponed due to not having\nthe completed service plan and therapy reports.\n2",
    "Documents Reviewed:\n• 9/25/24-10/24/24 Initial Service Plan, completed 10/24/24,\napproved 10/27/24.\n• 10/25/24-1/22/25 Updated Service Plan, completed 2/4/25\n(12 days late), approved 2/18/25.\n• 1/23/25-4/22/25 Updated Service Plan, completed 4/21/25,\napproved 5/5/25.\nAnalysis A violation was found. Based on a review of the case file and\ninterviews with staff and Parent, it was determined the agency\ncompleted one USP twelve days late.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTechnical assistance was offered to ensure service plans only\ncover the period in time in which has occurred. The 1/23/25-\n4/22/25 Updated Service Plan was completed on 4/21/25,\nhowever the end date of the report went until 4/22/25, one day\nfollowing the completion date. Anything that may have occurred\non 4/22/25 would not be captured on this Updated Service Plan\nnor the next plan as that period would begin on 4/23/25.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\nSection (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents and the\nDescription foster parents in the development of service plans to enable the\nparent or parents and foster parents to understand the plan for the\nchild and the parents' and the foster parent's role in assisting the\nagency in carrying out the plan.

In a follow-up contact on 6/4/25, Complainant\nstated FCW was a “slacker” and Parent could provide more detail.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was contacted by email on 6/26/25\nand interviewed by video call on 6/30/25. FCW stated Parent was\nhesitant to meet with her recently, as Attorney (parent’s attorney)\n3",
    "advised against it. FCW believed Parent’s view of her was tainted\nby Attorney. Initially Attorney was very happy with FCW and gave\na lot of praise for how the case was being handled. Then suddenly\nAttorney changed their mind and the relationship with Parent\nchanged. FCW reported Attorney called her “stupid and\nincompetent” and told Parent FCW was against her. FCW spoke\nwith Parent and gave reassurance that her goal was to be there\nfor Parent and the children, no matter what Attorney’s opinion\nwas. Parent sent an apology text to FCW regarding Attorney’s\nactions. Parent continues to be involved in the case, attends\nFamily Team Meetings (FTM), and discusses services with FCW.\nParent is aware of what is required and has completed all of the\nservices needed. Unsupervised visits were recently granted and\nthe case continues to move toward reunification.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was contacted by email on\n6/26/25 and an interview was completed via video call on 7/1/25.\nFCS stated FCW and Parent had a good working relationship.\nFCW met with Parent in person every month to discuss services\nand the treatment plan. FCW also communicated with Parent via\nphone call or text almost daily. However, it appeared Parent was\nbeing negatively influenced by Attorney. During a recent FTM,\nAttorney spoke poorly about FCW to the entire group. Parent\nspoke up and corrected Attorney as some of the things she said\nwere inaccurate. Parent then texted FCW after the meeting and\napologized. At the time of this interview, FCS reported Parent and\nFCW continued to have a positive working relationship.\nParent was interviewed by phone on 7/16/25. Parent reported\nFCW did a good job staying in contact and communicating. Parent\nstated she had a lot of contact with FCW regarding case services\nand what was needed for reunification to happen. Parent stated\nshe “loves” FCW and “would never want another worker”. Parent\nsaid FCW’s heart was in this case, she knew the case, and she\nwas working hard for Parent and the children. Parent reported she\ndid not have any concerns regarding FCW. Parent stated she had\nseveral concerns regarding the DHHS Children’s Services\nworkers that initiated the investigation that brought the children\ninto care. Parent was informed DCWL does not regulate that area\nof DHHS and provided Parent with contact information for the\nOffice of the Family Advocate.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Case contacts were reviewed in MiSACWIS. There were\nseveral phone, text and in person contacts between FCW\nand Parent. Parent attended multiple FTMs with FCW and\n4",
    "signed PATPs indicating FCW reviewed the information\nwith her.\n• Texts from Parent to FCW were reviewed. In summary,\nParent acknowledged that Attorney called FCW names and\nsaid inappropriate things about her. Parent stated she did\nnot want another worker and knew FCW was doing her\nbest.\nAnalysis No violation was found. Based on documented case contacts and\ninterviews, it was determined the agency kept Parent informed of\ncase information and included Parent in case planning and\ndevelopment.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n_ _______________July 16, 2025______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 18, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
