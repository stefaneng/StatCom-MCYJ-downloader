There is a recommendation\nthat the license be changed to a first provisional due to the severity of the violations.\nSpecial Investigation 2022C0103009 was initiated due to an allegation the program\ndirector took a youth to the group, made him strip, and reached into the youth’s\nunderwear in order to get his phone; An LIRS staff twisted a youth’s arm; the youth\nare not provided with adequate dental, medical, or mental health services; grievances\nare not in the youths language; staff belittle and laugh at the youth; a youth was left\nalone in the van while the group went into the trampoline park for 2 hours,\ninterpreters and federal employees restrained youth even though they are not trained.\nThe facility was found in violation of R 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff due to youth not\nbeing properly supervised; R 400.4109 (c) Program statement due to the facility\nadmitted youth that were not appropriate for the program; R 400.4159 Resident\n5",
    "restraint due to staff performing an unwarranted restraint, restraints not being\ndocuments, and untrained employees completing restraints. A CAP has been\nrequested. The licensing recommendation from 2022C0103005 stands for this\ninvestigation.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nPrior to January 2022, the facility served as a short-term shelter for refugees. Most of\nthe refugees were from Central America. On 1/4/22 the shelter took placement of 19\nAfghan youth through their Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) contract.\nSamaritas reported they did not want to take placement of the youth, but ORR pays\nfor the number of beds through the contract. Prior to the youth being admitted the\nshelter was not informed of the level of risk the youth posed due to threatening,\nphysical acting out, sexual acting out, truancy, and suicidality. They also reported\nthey were not informed the youth would be considered long-term placements. ORR\nwas aware that the program was set up to be a short-term shelter placement.\nSamaritas decided to temporarily close the shelter as they were unable to provide\nappropriate staffing for the youth due to the behavior needs of the youth.\nThe Chief Administrator recognizes the issues they had with staffing and following\nsafety plans put in place. They have come up with a plan that will address the issues\ndiscovered during the course of the above investigations. They plan to revamp the\nprogram prior to re-opening and conduct extensive reviews of program policies,\nprocedures, staffing, and expectations.\nInterviews:\nMany interviews were conducted throughout the course of the investigations listed\nabove. Staff 1 reported he has been voicing his concerns with the facility and ORR\nsince the 19 youth were admitted to the program. The Program Director, Chief\nAdministrator, and Chief Operations Officer all indicated they were not equipped to\ntake in 19 youth at the same time especially given their behaviors. ORR sent the\nfacility federal employees however those employees did not have clearances,\nemployment documentation, or training to be employed in the shelter. The facility\nmanagement stated they did not want the federal employees however ORR sent the\nemployees anyway.\nEleven youth were interviewed about their experience in the shelter and all eleven of\nthem reported they were unhappy. They reported they did not have enough\nrecreation time. They also did not have the water or food they wanted, haircuts,\nclothing, or dental care they needed. Staff made promises to them that they did not\nkeep, and many of them felt unsafe at the shelter. The youth did say staff supervise\nthem well, but they were anxious about their future and some of the youth in the\nfacility are aggressive and destructive.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n6",
