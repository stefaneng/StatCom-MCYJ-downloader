    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Sufficiency of staff.\nTitle\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126\nSection The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for\nthe continual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth J went Absent With Out Leave (AWOL) four times in one\nmonth implying inadequate staff supervision.\nInvestigation Documents reviewed:\nI was assigned this investigation on 3/11/24 with the Complainant\nlisted as anonymous.\nI reviewed Wolverine Center’s Truancy Prevention Policy revised\n3/1/24 which indicates the following: When a youth AWOLs, staff\nare to make efforts to verbally redirect, offer support and present\nalternatives to truanting. Direct care staff will walk outdoors with\nthe youth encouraging him to return but will not physically\nintervene. When line of sight is lost, direct care staff will notify the\nsupervisor on duty. The supervisor will ensure law enforcement is\nnotified.\nI reviewed incident reports confirming Youth J AWOLed from the\nfacility four times. Each incident report was reviewed and signed\nby the Chief Administrator (CA). Precipitating events ranged from\nYouth J’s unwillingness to follow staff directions to unwillingness\nto wait for a desired recreational activity.\nThe incident report on 2/15/24 indicated Youth J was redirected\nand followed outdoors by staff, the supervisor was notified, and a\nmissing person’s report was filed.\nThe incident report on 3/1/24 indicated Youth J ran outdoors with\na peer, was followed by staff, verbally redirected and a missing\nperson’s report was filed with police.\n2",
    "The incident report on 3/7/24 indicated Youth J and other youth\nrefused to go to their rooms at bedtime, walked outdoors, were\nredirected, followed by staff and returned before a missing\nperson’s report could be filed.\nThe incident report on 3/10/24 indicated Youth J and other youths\nwent AWOL, were redirected by staff, staff lost line of sight and a\nmissing person’s report was filed.\nInterviews:\nI contacted Youth J’s Foster Care Worker and notified him of the\ninvestigation assignment.\nWhen Government Worker 1 and I arrived at the school, an\nunidentified adult announced to Youth J in front of other youths\nthat “CPS wanted to talk to him.” Youth J’s Foster Care Worker\nwas also at the school and Government Worker 1 invited him to sit\nin on the interview.\nInitially Youth J refused to talk to investigators. After some\nencouragement from Government Worker 1, he entered the\ninterview room on crutches with his left foot bandaged.\nI interviewed Youth J jointly with Government Worker 1 and Foster\nCare Worker present. Government Worker 1 asked him about his\nmost recent AWOL on 3/10/24. At first, he shrugged and could\nnot say why he left the building. Then he stated he left because\nhe was upset that his own behaviors make him ineligible for\noutings. Youth J said when he leaves without permission, there\nare two to three staff monitoring four youths. He said he always\nAWOLs alone around 2pm and staff follow him and “say stuff,”\nwhich is inconsistent with reports indicating Youth J went AWOL\ntwice with other youths between 6pm – 8pm.\nI interviewed Youth Z at the facility jointly with Government Worker\n1. He said he has gone AWOL but never with Youth J. “Staff kept\ntelling us to come back.” Asked if there are consequences for\ngoing AWOL, Youth Z responded, “Can’t go on outings.” I asked\nwhat would keep him and other youths from going AWOL. He\nsaid he did not know.\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker 1. He\nhas worked at the facility for 33 years. Supervisor was asked\nwhat staff do when a youth leaves without permission. He said\nstaff follow them outdoors unless it is dark, unsafe or would leave\nthe building out of ratio. Staff verbally redirect the youth(s) back\n3",
    "and maintain contact with the supervisor on duty. Supervisor said\nhe sometimes drives around the neighborhood looking for them.\n“Kids will run and hide behind bushes and lots and throw stuff at\nstaff. One threw a brick at the agency vehicle.” Supervisor\nbelieves most youths that AWOL do it because they do not want\nto be in residential placement.\nAsked specifically about Youth J, Supervisor said he has pushed\npast staff, pushed staff to the ground, picked up objects outdoors\nand pretended he would cut himself if staff came near him. “We\ncannot block the doors because this is an open facility. There’s\nnot too much else we can do…Youth J will destroy property. He\nhas broken the staff badge scanner inside the building and glass\nblock windows on the building outdoors. In terms of his most\nrecent AWOL on 3/10/24, Supervisor said Youth J and others\nwere playing outdoors monitored by two staff and left the property\ntogether for no apparent reason. “Staff notified me. Staff 1\nfollowed Youth J and lost sight of him after 15 minutes. I write the\npolice reports (at the facility) and a staff person takes it to the\nDetroit Police Department 5th Precinct.\nI interviewed Staff 1 via phone on 3/18/24. He has only worked at\nthe facility for three weeks. Staff 1 did not recall any specific\ndetails surrounding Youth J’s AWOL on 3/10/24. When youths\nAWOL, he said staff verbally encourage them to return and follow\nthem until they lose sight of the youth.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator (CA) jointly with Government\nWorker 1. She reviewed the incident reports and affirmed that\nstaff followed the written procedures for each of Youth J’s AWOLs.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis When Youth J went AWOL, there was no indication of inadequate\nstaff supervision.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n4",
