This program will serve adolescent boys\nbetween the ages of 10 - 17 who have a history of abuse/neglect, struggles with\nmental stability, has developmental disabilities and/or cognitive impairments. Youth\neligible for this program, must be ambulatory, must be able to perform activities of\ndaily living, and must not be medically fragile.\nServices provided are tailored to meet each individual resident’s identified treatment\nneeds and permanency goals. A licensed Masters Level Social Worker (LMSW)\nprovides counseling (individual and/or family). This program provides an intensive,\nbroadly structured setting that will provide for the needs of each youth on an\nindividual basis. Each youth will be evaluated in a team setting involving the referring\nworker, other service providers and family members to develop a comprehensive\nindividualized treatment plan. The treatment goals will consider the level of\nfunctioning of each youth. Family members will be asked to invest themselves in the\nprogram with a focus on helping them understand the strengths and limitations of the\nyouth and to learn about the effects of trauma on the youth.\nServices provided in this program are described as follows: Daily program will help\nbuild the youth’s ability for independent living skills along with evaluating their needs\nfor aftercare services. Both psychiatric and psychological assessments will help\ndevelop the treatment goals and as well as trauma assessments, ACE assessments,\nbiopsychosocial assessments, medical and dental assessments, and any other\nassessments that are determined to be necessary.
