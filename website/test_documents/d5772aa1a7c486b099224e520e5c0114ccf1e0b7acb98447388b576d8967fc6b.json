TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:.\n• Orientation must be clear on training transcripts. It should be labeled as such and\nthere should be a checklist or list describing what tasks are included in\norientation.\n• Quarterly file reviews being completed would help ensure necessary documents\nare in the file and the file is being maintained in a uniform manner as required.\nThere are checklists at the beginning of each file section, but they're not being\nutilized appropriately.\n• The facility must create and follow a uniform process for employee records to\nensure all the information required by licensing rules is in the employee's file,\nespecially at the time of the facility's annual audit. The electronic files provided by\nHR were missing multiple documents. It doesn't matter if the HR file comes from\nthe program directly or HR, but the file provided must include all required\ndocuments.\n• The facility should develop a process to ensure discharge plans are being\ncompleted for discharged youth.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request or require any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had a violation for Rule 113(1)(i) on their Original Inspection Report.\nThe facility updated their new/transfer hire checklists to reflect the central registry\ntimeframe requirements, required program director sign-off prior to hire, and\nrequired hire documents to be uploaded to the agency's internal database to\ncreate a uniform staff file.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's financial budget and financial audit were reviewed and there were no\nconcerns noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported case management has not been run properly,\nwhich caused many of their violations for this audit. CA reported they were not\ndoing what they were required to do, and the case management supervisor wasn't\nproviding the necessary oversight and follow-up. CA reported the case\nmanagement supervisor no longer works at the facility and they are hoping the\nnext supervisor will improve their processes and be more vigilant in her follow-up\nand organization. CA reported one case management staff was terminated due to\nall the missing items from files. CA reported the case management department\nhas a lack of accountability and transitions in roles have also been a consistent\nbarrier to compliance.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nCase Manager reported she is brand new and currently in training. She reported\nthings were going really well and she feels very supported. She reported training is\nextensive and goes over everything she would need to know, so she feels\ncomfortable in her role. She reported there are many positive differences from her\nprevious role, so she feels comfortable asking for help and seeking guidance.\nYouth Specialist reported things have been going well. She reported there have\nbeen issues with transporting the youth places in the past, but since the new\nsupervisors have come in, those things as well as other things have greatly\nimproved. She reported they are starting to teach the youth about more resources,\ntransportation, life skills, and independent living skills so they are more successful\nupon leaving the facility. She reported she feels supported in her role with the new",
    "supervisors in place. She reported her only concern is issues with staff scheduling\nand staffing struggles causing most of the conflict.\nSupervisor reported the overall culture and environment of the facility are\nimproving. Relationships between supervisors and staff and supervisors and youth\nare also greatly improving. She reported she would like more support from upper\nmanagement. She reported they were given a list of things to improve, but not a\nlot of guidance or support to implement the changes. She reported having a co-\nsupervisor has been very helpful. However, they need more support from\nleadership and having a program director/CA split between two programs has\nbeen difficult. She reported there is no assistant supervisor currently, so hiring for\nthat position will provide support to staff and youth as well. She reported they're\nworking on a better structure for programming and staff seem to be receptive to\nfeedback. She reported youth seem to be more open to providing feedback and\nappear more comfortable in freely expressing their concerns.\nYouth reported they feel safe at the facility and staff are nice. Youth reported the\nfood is good and they get enough food. One youth reported he wants help looking\nfor a job and staff won't agree to take him, so he has to find his own way. Another\nyouth reported he wanted to get a car, and he felt staff were not helping him do so.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on 9/5/25 and there were no safety concerns\nnoted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nOctober 9, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 10, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
