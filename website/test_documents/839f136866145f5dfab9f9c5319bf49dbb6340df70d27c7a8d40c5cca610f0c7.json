    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12202 Policy and Procedures\nSection • (1) An agency shall have and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures for all the areas of foster care services as\nprovided in R400.12203 to R 400.12214.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency has delayed referring foster care cases to adoption on\ntwo occasions within the last couple of months. In one instance,\nthe adoption referral was made just shy of 4 months after\ntermination of parental rights occurred.\nInvestigation Supervisor was interviewed via telephone on 11/26/2024. The\nsame information was repeated from the allegation which was\ntermination occurred for Foster Child A (FCA) who is placed with\nRelative Caregiver. Relative Caregiver was previously licensed\nwith Bethany Christian Services. Relative Caregiver abruptly\nclosed her foster home license with Holy Cross Services on 9/9/24\nand moved in with the substitute caregiver of FCA.\nBethany Christian Services were aware that Termination of\nParental Rights (TPR) occurred with FCA. After the closure of\nRelative Caregiver’s license with Holy Cross Services, Relative\nCaregiver expressed a desire to work with Bethany Christian\nServices again. FCA continued to be placed with Relative\nCaregiver however through Bethany Children Services. Bethany\nChristian Services had adoption case management availability\nand could accept the Relative Caregiver and FCA’s case once the\ncase was referred for adoption. FCA’s case was not referred to\nadoption until 10/21/2024. Supervisor added that a referral for\nadoption has to occur within 5 business days from the receipt of\ntermination of parental rights order per policy and Holy Cross\nreceived the TPR order on 8/28/2024. Supervisor did not provide\nadditional information.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\n12/12/24 & 2/10/24. She reported she was assigned FCA’s case\nin July of 2023. She reported that Chief Administrator (CA) was\nfunctioning in several positions and was her supervisor at the\ntime. FCW said several staff members had abruptly departed\nfrom the agency and a lot of cases needed attention and follow-up\nwith reports, home visits etc. FCW said CA asked if she needed\nany help with the cases she was assigned and she asked if CA\ncould complete FCA’s docket for her. FCW said during that time,\n2",
    "Relative Caregiver moved a week later, after FCA’s parental\ntermination rights hearing and closed her license with Holy Cross\nagency. FCW reported because Relative Caregiver moved and\nwas no longer licensed, FCA’s referral packet was not sent within\nthe five business days of her parents’ termination hearing as\nrequired per policy. FCW reported that in order to make a referral\nfor adoption for FCA, another relative licensing home study\nneeded to take place, and this process was unavoidable, and that\nprocess takes time. FCW reported she completed the home study\nin October 2024. FCW reported she did not complete a follow up\nwith CA to determine if CA had completed the referral packet for\nFCA. FCW explained she did not complete a follow up because\nshe assumed CA had moved forward and completed the referral\npacket. She reported she felt awful when she discussed the\nadoption referral packet with CA and discovered CA had not\ncompleted the referral packet for FCA. FCW reported it was a\nchain of unfortunate events and that she completed the home\nstudy on Relative Caregiver and the adoption referral packet for\nFCA was late, but it was completed in late October 2024.\nInterview with Chief Administrator (CA) via video conference\non 11/26/2024. CA reported she was working in several roles\nduring the time that FCA’s referral packet needed to be submitted\nfor adoption. She reported she was FCW’s supervisor at the time\nas well as Interim Chief Administrator. She reported that 2024\nhas been the most difficult year with staffing and the agency was\ngoing through a transitional period of losing numerous staff in key\nroles such as supervisors and foster care workers due to being\nterminated for various reasons and/or staff leaving the agency\nwithout notice. CA reported she was filling in those positions/roles\nuntil additional staff was hired. CA admitted her agency dropped\nthe ball of submitting FCA’s referral packet five days after parental\nrights termination hearing due to staff not performing their job\nduties and leaving a mess that had to be cleaned up. CA reported\nas the director of the agency she was dealing with case changes\nand a combination of other errors within the agency. CA admitted\nthat FCA referral packet was one of those errors that occurred.\nCA reported this is not a pattern of her agency and FCA’s referral\npacket was late but has been completed. Since then, the agency\nhas hired additional staff. CA admitted FCW asked her to\ncomplete the referral packet for FCA and she neglected to follow\nthrough due to completing many other functions such as home\nvisits, parenting time, report writing and the referral packet for\nFCA was on her list of to do’s and she did not get to it timely. CA\nreported she was very familiar with the referral packet when a\nchild’s permanency plan is adoption and the TPR has occurred for\n3",
    "a child. She reported however at the time; the agency referral\nprocess was not followed. She had no additional information.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• FCA’S case record. FCA was born 12/26/22 and placed with her\nmaternal aunt and uncle on 12/28/22 where she currently resides.\nAll medical/dentals are up to date. She is in the process of being\nadopted by her Relative Caregivers.\n• Relative Caregiver case record. FCA was placed with Relative\nCaregiver upon exiting the hospital on 12/28/22. FCA’s case\ntransferred to Bethany Children Services on 11/5/24. Adoption\nAssessment was completed on 12/27/24. It is expected that FCA\nwill be adopted with Relative Caregiver by or around June 2025.\n• Agency procedure/statement on foster care referral for adoption\nonce the child’s termination of parental rights has occurred is the\nagency will receive the order from the courts and submit a referral\npacket to MDHHS for the agency to move forward with the child’s\npermanency plan.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance. Based on interviews and\ndocumentation, FCA’s foster care referral packet for adoption was\nnot submitted following the termination of her parents’ parental\nrights on 8/28/24. The agency did not follow their written process/\nprocedure for the foster care referral services for adoption for FCA\nrequired per the CPA foster care policy and procedure for foster\ncare per the rule.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
