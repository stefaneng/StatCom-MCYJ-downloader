METHODOLOGY\n03/08/2022 Special Investigation Intake\n2022C0325018\n03/08/2022 Special Investigation Initiated - On Site\ncompleted with 185230\n03/08/2022 Pre Exit Conference\n03/08/2022 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\nALLEGATION: Facility is discharging residents without completing\ndischarge paperwork.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/16/22, I received a complaint regarding Mott Children’s Residence. Youth A,\nplaced at Optimist House, was involved in an allegation with a youth from Mott\nChildren’s Residence. Youth A was removed from Optimist House and placed into Motts\nChildren Residence due to an altercation between Youth A and peers at Mott Children’s\nResidence. He was removed from Optimist House on 1/28/22 and placed into Mott\nChildren’s Residence Until 1/31/22.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 on 2/16/22. Administrator 1 reported that Youth A was\nremoved from his placement at Optimist House and placed into Mott Children’s Home\ndue to an altercation in Youth A’s facility. Administrator 1 reported that they make\n“respite” placements with the children in their care.\nI interviewed Administrator 2 and Administrator 3. Both reported they move children\nfrom one facility to another although they are under different license. Both reported they\n2",
    "have been performing this action for over five years. Both reported they will move\nchildren due to conflicts between other children or staffing issues.\nAdministrator 3 reported the DHS 3600 does specify the facility the child is to be placed\nin. Administrator 3 reported Youth A’s placement is Optimist House.\nOptimist House did not have discharge papers completed for Youth A when they\nremoved him from the placement.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan.\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional care, all\nof the\nfollowing information shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n(a) The date of and reason for discharge, and the new\nlocation of the child.\n(b) A brief summary or other documentation of the\nservices provided while in residence, including medical and\ndental services.\n(c) An assessment of the resident?s needs that remain\nto be met.\n(d) Any services that will be provided by the facility after\ndischarge.\n(e) A statement that the discharge plan\nrecommendations, including medical and dental follow up\nthat is needed, have been reviewed with the resident and\nwith the parent and with the responsible case manager.\n(f) The name and official title of the person to whom the\nresident was discharged.\n3",
    "ANALYSIS:  Optimist House removed Youth A from the facility on\nJanuary 28-January 31, 2022.\n Both Administrator 2 and Administrator 3 reported they\nmove children from Optimist House and Mott Children’s\nHouse as a form of respite for issues amongst the\nchildren or staffing issues. Discharge paperwork for these\nplacements are not completed.\n Respite is not a licensing term. When a child is removed\nfrom one licensed facility and placed into a new licensed\nfacility, then the child is being discharged from one\nplacement and placed into another.\n The agency cannot fluidly move children from one\nlicensed facility to a different licensed facility. The 3600\ndetermines the legal placement.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended the license remain unchanged upon receipt of an acceptable\nCAP.\n3/23/22\n_______________________________________\nVenus M.
