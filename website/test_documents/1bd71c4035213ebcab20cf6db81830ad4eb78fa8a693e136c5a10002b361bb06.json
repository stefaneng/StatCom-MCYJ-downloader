It was\nreported that Parent 1 has not seen her son (Youth A) in person\nsince he was moved across the state. The siblings have not seen\neach other in person since the move across the state. Foster\nParent 1 requested help from DHHS but did not get it and then\nFoster Parent 1 requested the medically fragile child (Youth A) be\nmoved. No FTM was held before the move. Parent 1 has been\n2",
    "given no information about the move except that it occurred, and\nthe Youth A is still across the state. No relatives were given\nserious consideration as placement.\nAdministrator:\nThe administrator and Foster Care Supervisor were interviewed\nand provided the following case history on 4/28/2023 regarding\ncase planning of Youth A and Parent 1. Youth A was removed on\n12/11/2019 due to severe physical abuse. Parental Rights were\nterminated on 2/26/2021 and Youth A and his siblings were made\nMCI wards.\nOn 4/8/2022, Supreme Court overturned Parent 1’s termination of\nparental rights and the children became TCW’s again. After being\nserviced by several private agencies, on 04/08/2022, Youth A’s\ncase came back to be serviced by MDHHS direct Foster Care.\nChildren’s Center maintains full family responsibility. Because of\nthis, Children’s Center has the majority of the communication with\nYouth A’s guardian, Parent 1.\nIt should be noted that Youth A (3 years old) is medically fragile\ndue to severe physical abuse that occurred while in the care of his\nparents. He is diagnosed with Shaken baby syndrome, sequela at\n3 months of age, Non-accidental TBI, Anoxic brain injury, Spastic\ndystonic tetraplegic cerebral palsy, Cortical Visual Impairment,\nlegally blind, Gerd, Dystonia, Oropharyngeal dysphagia (at risk for\naspiration) and Focal Epilepsy. He is non-verbal. He is unable to\nsit, stand, or walk. He is prescribed numerous medications due to\nhis conditions and requires 24/7 care.\nThe Administrator and Foster Care Supervisor reported that Youth\nA is overdue for all of his immunizations. Parent 1 signed an\nimmunization waiver on 01/21/2021 citing “I don’t want my\nchildren having shots.” Youth A’s injury has resulted in his\nmuscles becoming extremely tight and spasming. Parent 1 has\nbeen contacted by Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation to obtain consent\nto inject Youth A with Botox and phenol into his legs to assist with\nhis tone, help him be more comfortable, and to help prevent his\nneed for hip surgery. It was reported that Parent 1 was unwilling to\nprovide consent for this procedure and refused to speak with the\nPediatric Rehabilitation Physician directly.\nThe Administrator and Foster Care Supervisor reported Youth A’s\nPlacement history as follows:\n3",
    "From 12/11/2019- 2/10/2022: Relative Placement with paternal\nrelative in Detroit.\nOn 2/10/2022- 4/10/2023: Youth A was placed with a licensed\nfoster parent in Reed City, MI. At the time of placement, Youth A\nwas an MCI Ward. Foster Parent 1 worked very hard to swiftly get\nYouth A in with all the services and specialists he needed. Foster\nParent 1 became increasingly concerned about Youth A not being\nable to receive the medical care that will protect him as well as\nassist with his comfort because of Parent 1’s unwillingness to\nprovide the needed medical consents. Foster Parent 1 was also\nnot prepared to assist with facilitating parental visitations as Youth\nA was placed in her home as an MCI Ward. Foster Parent 1 felt\nthat she was constantly having to prove that the care she was\nproviding to Youth A was for the right reasons. Foster Parent 1\nbecame frustrated and submitted a 14-day notice requesting\nYouth A’s replacement on 03/22/2023.\nOn 4/10/2023 – Present, Youth A is placed with licensed Foster\nParents 2 in Hudsonville, MI.\nFoster Care Supervisor:\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed on 4/28/2023 and\nreported the following information regarding Parent 1’s cognitive\nabilities. The Foster Care Supervisor reported that MDHHS does\nnot have any records specifically identifying that Parent 1 has any\ncognitive impairments. She said Parent 1 participated with a\npsychological evaluation on 08/22/2022. The psychological\nevaluation estimated that Parent 1 overall level of intellectual\nfunctioning may fall within or near the “Borderline” range with a\nFull-Scale IQ in the 70-79 range. The report stated, “Parent 1\nresults were not low enough to suggest a diagnosis of a full\nintellectual disability or any serious cognitive deficits.”\nFoster Care Supervisor said Parent 1 participated with a\npsychiatric evaluation on 11/8/2022. The psychiatric evaluation\nnotes that there were no reports of\ndevelopmental/education/social delays. During the evaluation\nParent 1 denied special education services due to learning\ndisabilities and she reported to meeting all developmental\nmilestones on time.\nSupervisor from Children’s Center:\nThe Supervisor from Children’s Center was interviewed on\n6/6/2023. She reported Family Team Meetings (FTM) are held\n4",
    "quarterly as required. The last meeting was a Team Decision\nMeeting (TDM) to discuss placement move for Youth A. She\nreported the agency is working on scheduling an FTM on\n6/12/2023 to discuss the case service plan, treatment plan, and\nParent 1’s children’s needs.\nThe supervisor reported the foster care workers that have been\nassigned to this case are patient with Parent 1 in all\ncommunications. She said the workers take the time to listen to\nParent 1 questions and repeat if needed. She said what works\nbest with Parent 1 is to give her choices and use shorter\nsentences at times to make sure she understands and have\nParent 1 repeat the information back. She said Parent 1 tends to\nget angry easily and argumentative if things do not go her way\nwhich have led her to being muted on meetings or requested to\nleave the agency premises. Furthermore, the agency has given\nParent 1 resources and the website from Children’s Hospital\nregarding trach care for Youth A. The Supervisor said Parent 1\nagreed to take a CPR /First Aid class. Parent 1 mentioned she\nalready took this class and must see if her certification needed to\nbe renewed. The Supervisor provided the following information\nregarding working with Parent 1. She said Parent 1 has been\nreferred to all court ordered services and accommodations have\nbeen given to Parent 1 to make sure she can attend these\nservices. Parent 1 has been provided the following\nservices/accommodations.\nDrug screens have been performed at The Children’s Center or\nthrough Assured Family Services. Parenting times have been\nsupervised at The Children’s Center. Parent 1 was offered twice a\nweek parenting time but requested her visits be once a week at 2\nhours a day with her girls. Parenting classes were through\nAssured Family Services and were able to meet with her individual\nby virtual appointments. Parent 1 was able to receive a certificate.\nPsychological evaluation was virtual and one on one through\nAssured Family Services. Psychiatric evaluation was virtual and\none on one through Assured Family Services. Individual therapy\nappointments are held weekly virtually. The therapist is aware of\nParent 1’s diagnosis. Infant mental health services are in place for\nParent 1 two daughters and Parent 1 could participate in these\nappointments or speak with the therapist separately on their\ntreatment or questions she may have. Parent 1 has the therapist\nphone and email information. Parent 1 was offered supportive\nvisitation program through Orchards Children’s Services and\nParent 1 denied being a part of this program. The supportive\n5",
    "visitation coach did make all attempts to educate Parent 1 on the\nprogram and how they could assist her with her children during\nvisits and give additional parental education before or after a visit.\nParent 1 was referred for a parent partner support through Judson\nCenter. Parent 1 initially said yes and then later refused to be a\npart of the program. Parent 1 is a part of the Maternal Infant\nHealth program through Great Start which allows Parent 1 to visit\nwith a social worker monthly to provide her with social support,\ntransportation to appointments, and baby items. Parent 1 has a\nsocial worker at New Foster program who visits her monthly in the\nhome as additional support advocate for Parent 1. The agency\nhas assisted Parent 1 with referrals to emergency shelters when\nshe did not have power to her home. The agency offered Uber\nand Greyhound bus transportation. Parent 1 does receive therapy,\ncase management, medication management through Team\nWellness in addition to the services mentioned above.\nDocuments reviewed:\nYouth A’s case file was reviewed on 4/28/2023. He is 3 years old.\nHe was placed in the same relative placement from 12/11/19 –\n2/10/22, with MDHHS and two private agencies having case\nresponsibilities during that time frame. He was placed with a\nlicensed foster parent from 2/10/22 – 4/10/23 and with another\nlicensed foster parent from 4/10/23 to present.\nParent 1’s psychological and psychiatric evaluations. Other than\nwhat was reported regarding parent 1’s results, there was no\nadditional information.\nAnalysis Based on interviews, documentation of Parent 1’s psychological\nand psychiatric evaluations and the support provided by MDHHS\nto Parent 1, it is not substantiated that the agency did not provide\nadequate case planning that took into account the Parent 1's\nlimited cognitive abilities. The agency also provided initial\nconsideration with relative placement and placing siblings\ntogether.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time\nSection (1) An agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nDescription parenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the following:\n(c) Provisions for visits between parents and children except\nwhere parental rights have been terminated or when there is a\ncourt determination that visits are detrimental to the child.\n6",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Lack of parental visits.\nInvestigation Foster Care Supervisor from MDHHS:\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed on 4/28/2023. She\nreported when Parent 1’s parental rights were reinstated to Youth\nA in April 2022, Youth A was placed approximately three hours\naway from Parent 1. Parent 1 reported that she did not have\ntransportation to get where Youth A was placed to visit with him.\nGreyhound bus tickets and gas cards were offered. Parent 1\nrefused these stating she does not like the bus. Foster Care\nSupervisor said transportation and distance are a barrier for in\nperson visits so on 07/26/2022, the court ordered DHHS the\ndiscretion to utilize virtual visits. She said Youth A is extremely\nmedically fragile and easily susceptible to infection and not being\ncurrent on his immunizations exacerbates this matter. She said\nYouth A’s current caregivers are trained on how to adequately\nutilize and maintain his g-tube, identify, and intervene regarding\nhis epilepsy, administer his medication, and provide emergency\ncare if needed. The caregivers are not willing to assist with\nfacilitating parenting time visits. The FCS said she nor Parent 1\nare currently trained regarding Youth A’s medical needs. She said\nthis has prohibited the Foster Care staff from picking Youth A up\nand taking him to a neutral location for Parent 1 to visit with him.\nShe said because of not being trained, visits have consistently\noccurred virtually. Foster Parent 2 do not have supportive\nindividuals that is trained on how to care for Youth A that would\nalso be willing to facilitate visits. She said MDHHS is currently in\ncontact with Youth A’s medical providers to identify where Parent\n1 can be trained regarding how to care for Youth A with his\nspecific medical needs. The FCS said MDHHS is currently\nexploring if there are options with Youth A’s medical providers to\nhave visits at a local hospital or medical facility.\nSupervisor from The Children’s Center:\nThe Supervisor from Children’s Center was interviewed on\n6/6/2023. She reported The Children’s Center has full family\nresponsibility and DHHS has case responsibility for Youth A. She\nreported she know DHHS has been making sure Parent 1 has\nbeen involved in virtual parenting times with Youth A at minimum\nonce a week. She said Parent 1 does not always show up or\nparticipate in her parenting times with Youth A based on\ninformation from DHHS. She said their agency has not\nsupervised any parenting times between Youth A and Parent 1.\nShe said there was one scheduled in person parenting time this\n7",
    "year, but Parent 1 cancelled in advance stating she had to attend\nto her cash assistance appointment instead. The supervisor said\nsince then, DHHS has been looking for ways to have in person\nvisits with Parent 1 and Youth A. She reported that Youth A\nneeded 24/7 care and a specialized medical professional will need\nbe present for all supervised parenting times moving forward. She\nsaid it is her understanding that Parent 1 was able to attend a\nmedical appointment for Youth A in person and DHHS provided\nUber transportation. The supervisor said her agency has offered\nto help with transportation and overnight stay if needed for Parent\n1.\nThe supervisor reported that the service plans do discuss Parent 1\ndiagnosis and includes her treatment plan for her and her children.\nShe said services and strategies are in place to take into\nconsideration for the goals and action steps for Parent 1 and her\nchildren. She said however, further development is needed to\ninclude more detailed in the steps to further assist Parent 1.\nAnalysis Based on interviews from MDHHS and The Children’s Center,\nParent 1 is offered transportation to visit with Youth A. The foster\ncare staff nor Parent 1 is trained to assist Youth A with his\nextensive medical needs. Foster Parent 1 has not accepted the\noffer of catching a bus or receiving bus tickets from the agency to\ngo and visit with Youth A on a more consistent basis. She was\noffered transportation by way of Uber which she accepted. There\nis not enough evidence to support that the agencies are not\nproviding transportation to Parent 1 to visit with Youth A on a more\nconsistent basis.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421Vistation and parenting time\nSection (1) An agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nDescription parenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the following:\n(d) Provisions for visits between siblings who are not placed\ntogether except when there is a court determination that visits are\ndetrimental to either child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Failure to look at relative placement.\nInvestigation Foster Care Supervisor:\n8",
    "Foster Care Supervisor reported Youth A’s Placement history as\nfollows:\nFrom 12/11/2019- 2/10/2022: Relative Placement with paternal\nrelative in Detroit. Paternal relative had placement of Youth A and\nhis two siblings. She initially signed an intent to adopt all three\nchildren, and then asked the court if she could do guardianship\ninstead. This request was denied. Parent 1requested Youth A and\none of his siblings be removed from the relative placement home\nand that the relative rights be rescinded for her intent to adopt.\nAll three children ended up being replaced from the relative\nhome. After Youth A was replaced from the relative home, Youth\nA was seen by an abundance of medical specialists. Youth A’s\nmedical needs were not being properly addressed while in the\nrelative’s care. It was also identified after Youth A was replaced\nthat the relative was attempting to receive SSI and foster care\npayments for Youth A.\nIt was reported by the Foster Care Supervisor that no other\nrelatives have come forth to care for Youth A other than the\nrelative home where Youth A siblings are placed with. She\nreported due to the siblings’ behavioral needs Youth A’s Guardian\nAd Litern (GAL) was not in support of placing Youth A in this\nrelative home because the GAL feels this would be too much for\nthe relative to handle based on the extensive medical needs of\nYouth A.\nAnalysis Based on the interview with the Foster Care Supervisor, Youth A\nwas originally place with a relative who intent was to adopt Youth\nA but rescinded her intent. Another relative came forth but this\ndecision was not accepted by the GAL due to Youth A’s extensive\nmedical needs. No other relative has come forth. Based on\ndocumentation and interviews, the agency is not in violation of\nfailure to look at relative placement.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n9",
