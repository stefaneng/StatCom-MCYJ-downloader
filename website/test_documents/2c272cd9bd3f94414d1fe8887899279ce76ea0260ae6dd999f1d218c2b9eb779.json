    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation In 2021, unidentified staff allowed unidentified youth to fight, and a\nyouth was hospitalized as a result.\nInvestigation DCWL received these allegations on 9/29/23 via DCWL online\ncomplaint. The incidents were alleged to have occurred sometime\nin 2021.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nThe identity of the Complainant is unknown. Based on the written\nallegations, he may be a former resident who spent time at\nWolverine Center in 2021. I attempted to reach Complainant on\n9/30/23 via email and phone. The email I sent was returned\nmarked “undeliverable”, and the phone number provided was out\nof service. Complainant omitted his last name, so I was unable to\nsearch MISACWIS to determine if he ever resided at the facility.\nGiven that the alleged incident(s) occurred two years ago, without\napproximate dates, descriptions, or names of the youths or staff\ninvolved, it was not possible to complete a focused investigation.\nHowever, a search of DCWL reports from 2020 – 2022 showed\nsimilar allegations were already investigated in that timeframe.\nI reviewed all investigation reports completed from 2020 – 2022\nand identified those with similar allegations related to staff not\nintervening in fights. These reports are listed below:\nSIR 2020C0108053 by myself dated 9/3/20. Rule 112 (4) (a) and\n(b) were cited for two staff members failing to intervene in a youth\nfight. As a result of this investigation, adverse action was taken,\nand the facility was placed on a First Provisional license and was\nrestored to a Regular license in 2021.\n2",
    "SIR 2020C0108073 by myself dated 10/9/20. For an allegation\nthat staff failed to protect two youth being beaten by other youths,\nno violations were established.\nSIR 2021C0103029 by Consultant 2 dated 7/28/21. For an\nallegation that staff failed to intervene in a fight, no violations were\nestablished.\nSIR 2022C0219023 by Consultant 3 dated 3/3/22. For an\nallegation that staff failed to intervene in a fight, no violations were\nestablished.\nSIR 2022C0219030 by Consultant 3 dated 3/18/22. For an\nallegation that staff were unaware of an altercation between\nyouths and did not intervene, no violations were established.\nSIR 2022C0219044 by Consultant 3 dated 6/14/22. For an\nallegation that staff were unaware of a youth being assaulted by\nanother youth, no violations were established.\nSIR 2022C0201513 by Consultant 2 dated 8/3/22. For an\nallegation that a youth was hit by another youth and it was\nunknown if staff intervened, no violations were established.\nFor the present allegations, I arrived at the facility unannounced\non 10/03/23 accompanied by Government Worker 1. We jointly\ninterviewed Program Director. She said there are no residents at\nthe facility who have been there since 2021. The resident who\nhas been there the longest was admitted on 5/24/23.\nI interviewed Youth K and Supervisors 1 and 2 separately and\njointly with Government Worker 1. All youth and staff interviewed\ndenied knowledge of any staff allowing or encouraging youths to\nfight or failing to intervene in fights between youths.\nGovernment Worker 1 interviewed Staff 1, and Youths L, M and C.\nThe youths all reported that staff intervene in fights by getting in\nbetween youths who are fighting. Staff 1 reported that staff\nintervene in fights by using verbal intervention and physically\nblocking and separating youths who are fighting.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\n3",
    "Analysis From 2020 through 2022, seven investigations were completed by\nDCWL for complaints alleging staff failed to intervene in youth\nfights. In 2020, licensing rule violations were established in one of\nthe seven incidents. The other six incidents were investigated,\nand no rule violations were found.\nGiven that the alleged incident(s) happened two years ago,\nwithout descriptions, or names of the youths or staff involved, it\ncannot be determined if any incidents that were not already\ninvestigated occurred.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a\nyouth’s background or appearance or mental state. Yelling,\nthreats, ridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation In 2021, unidentified staff verbally abused and name-called\nunidentified youth.\nInvestigation Given that the alleged incident(s) happened two years ago,\nwithout descriptions, or names of the youths or staff involved, it is\nnot possible to complete a focused investigation at this time.\nI searched and located completed special investigation reports\nfrom 2020 – 2022 with similar allegations regarding Wolverine\nCenter. I found one existing report with a similar allegation that\nstaff called youth names. SIR 2022C0219023 by Consultant 3\ndated 3/03/22 was completed with no violations found.\nSupervisor 1 and 2, Staff 1, and Youths M and L all reported that\nthey have never heard a staff member call youths names or\nantagonize them.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\n4",
    "Analysis Given that the alleged incident(s) occurred two years ago, without\ndescriptions, or names of the youths or staff involved, it cannot be\ndetermined if incidents that were not already investigated\noccurred.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nOctober 26, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 26, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
