I initiated a special investigation on the above said date. Agency staff\n2",
    "were interviewed as well as agency documents were reviewed. What follows is\ninformation obtained from the aforementioned sources.\nOn January 21, 2020, the agency Chief Administrator was interviewed by telephone.\nShe offered the following information. A biological parent, hereafter referred to as\nParent A, the parent of a child in the agency foster care program, was released from\njail in August 2019. At that time the agency foster care worker, hereafter referred to\nas Staff 1, began a romantic, inappropriate relationship with the Parent A. On\nJanuary 15, 2020, another agency foster care worker, hereafter referred to as Staff\n2, informed the Chief Administrator that Parent A had informed her that she had\nbeen in a relationship with Staff 1 and was upset because Staff 1 had recently\nterminated the relationship. Staff 2 had been assigned the case on January 1, 2020.\nThe Chief Administrator reported that she then contacted Staff 1 by text requesting\nthat he meet with her later in the day of January 15, 2020. The Chief Administrator\nreported that when she met with Staff 1 he readily confessed to having an\ninappropriate relationship with Parent A. The Chief Administrator informed Staff 1\nthat he was to turn in his agency badge, key, and computer which he did. The Chief\nAdministrator was then in contact with her supervisor, the Director of the agency,\nand the decision was made to terminate Staff 1’s employment which occurred on\nJanuary 16, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, Staff 2 was interviewed on site at the agency. Staff 2 reported\nshe had become the foster care worker for the case on January 1, 2020. Staff 2\nreported that in the late afternoon of January 14, 2020 she received a text from\nParent A. Parent A reported that she was suicidal because Staff 1 had ended the\nrelationship with her. Staff 2 reported that she had no prior knowledge of the\nrelationship between Parent A and Staff 1. Staff 2 reported that she contacted the\nChief Administrator the next day, January 15, 2020, requesting to meet with her\nprivately. Staff 2 reported that the meeting occurred in the early afternoon and she\ninformed the Chief Administrator of the information she had received from Parent A\nthe day before. Staff 2 reported that the Chief Administrator would address the\nsituation.\nOn February 27, 2020, I telephoned Staff 1 and left a voice mail message requesting\nthat he return my call as I wanted to interview him. A return call was not received.\nA review of documents were as follows:\nThe Chief Administrator presented a timeline of events which were reviewed and\ncorrespond with information obtained from the interviews.\nA Wellspring letter dated January 16, 2020 and addressed to Staff 1 states that due\nto unethical behavior with a client his employment with the agency is terminated\neffective January 16, 2020.\n3",
    "A series of text messages between Staff 2 and Parent A was provided. The text\nmessages establish that Parent A and Staff 1 had been involved in a relationship\nand that Parent A was hurt and upset that the relationship had ended.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training\nto perform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: Evidence indicates that an inappropriate relationship had\nexisted between Staff 1 and Parent A based on interviews with\nStaff 2, the Chief Administrator, and text messages observed\nbetween Parent A and Staff 1.\nThe agency was cited for R 400.12206 (1) Staff Qualifications in\nspecial investigation #2019C0114040 which was completed on\nNovember 13, 2019 and an acceptable corrective action plan\nwas received on December 16, 2019. The investigation\nestablished that a foster care worker was not holding\nprofessional boundaries with a client. The corrective action plan\nfor this investigation is applicable and relevant to the current\ninvestigation. It is recommended that the agency continue with\nthe corrective action plan currently in place and no further\ncorrective action is required.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that the agency continue with the current corrective action plan.\nMarch 12, 2020\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 24, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
