    "was necessary or it was a big deal. Staff 1 reported after Youth A\npressed the radio, he didn’t have time to call for back up because\nYouth A had already requested back up. Staff 1 reported if youth\nare physically aggressive or attack staff, staff are supposed to try\nto talk the youth down or physically restrain them, if possible.

Supervisor reported Staff 1 called on the radio\nrequesting a supervisor, but didn’t clarify whether it was an\nemergency or non-emergency.

Youth A\nputs his arms up and hits Staff 1 twice and they both take a step\nback. Staff 1 backs up into the control room and Youth A steps\ntowards the control room with his fists up. He then drops his fists,\nwalks towards the garbage can in the milieu, and picks it up. Staff\n1 exits the control room and charges at Youth A, backing him up\n4",
    "against the wall, and begins punching him. Youth A holds his arms\nup and begins punching Staff 1 back. Staff 1 is grabbing onto\nYouth A’s arm in between punches.

Youth A engaged in a verbal\naltercation with Staff 1 and then assaulted Staff 1 by\npunching and kicking him in the face. Supervisor along with\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 arrived on the pod to verbally de-\nescalate the situation, removed Staff 1 and counseling\nYouth A.\n• Discipline Policy states any type of physical discipline is\nprohibited.\n• Youth Discipline & Behavior Modification Policy states any\ntype of physical discipline is prohibited. The use of verbal\nand non-physical crisis intervention should be utilized first\nand may prevent the need for physical intervention. A youth\ninitiating physical contact with a staff or another person with\nthe intent of controlling or harming that person and/or picks\nup something to use as a weapon is considered a physical\nassault. The appropriate staff response is to use a safe\nphysical management procedure to control the youth and\nthen use the Behavior Management Procedure until the\nyouth is under physical and emotional control. Physical\nrestraint involves the application of approved holding\ntechniques to diffuse a youth who is dangerous to himself,\nothers, or program property.\n• Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary records in his\nemployee file.
