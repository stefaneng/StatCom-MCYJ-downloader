The clearance has since been\nreceived.\nCPA Rule 400.12306 Application request\n• (3) An agency shall provide the licensee with an\napplication for renewal of the license and\ndocument the action not less than 60 calendar\ndays before the expiration date of the license. A\nrenewal application must be provided to a\nlicensee, regardless of any pending\nrecommendation for disciplinary action of the\nlicense.\nOne of Three open foster home files reviewed contained documentation of the foster\nparent being provided a renewal application less than 60 day prior to the license\nexpiring.\nCPA Rule 400.12324 Reevaluation\n• (4) An agency shall document placement\nspecifications consistent with the information\ncontained in the reevaluation.

    "licensing inspection report. That CAP was approved on 6/3/2024 and addressed\n12 violations. Five of those violations were related to MDHHS policy requirements\nwhich are no longer regulated by DCWL. The remaining 7 violations were related\nto licensing requirements. All of those violations were adequately addressed\nthrough the CAP as evidenced by successful CAP compliance verification over a\n6-month review period and a lack of repeat violations during the 2025 inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator indicated there has been a lot of staff turnover during the\nperiod under review, including the majority of the leadership team. The chief\nadministrator identified several new processes, meetings, tracking methods, and\nworkgroups implemented following the last inspection which has resulted in an\nincrease in rule compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nReviewed annual financial audit report and no financial concerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed indicated, despite the changes over the past year,\nthey have felt supported and encouraged in their job responsibilities. They feel\nthere has been an increase in transparency and communication since a new\ndirector has been appointed which has led to an increased feeling of stability and\nsupport.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office appears to have adequate space and equipment to provide for\nthe delivery of foster home certification, foster care, adoption, and independent\nliving services. The files are stored securely in a locking file room preventing\nunauthorized access. Physical CHRI is stored in a separate location within a\nlocked office along with the cross shredder.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\n5",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMay 20, 2025\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 20, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
