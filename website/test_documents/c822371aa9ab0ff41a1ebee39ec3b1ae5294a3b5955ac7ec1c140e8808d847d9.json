They were in Youth A’s bedroom. Youth A does not\nlive there anymore. There is a male’s house and a female’s house. Youth B is going\nto the male’s house, and she will not stop going there. There is a staff member that\nguards the door to keep her out. It is unknown who the staff was that was supposed\nto be guarding the door. Some of the other boys let Youth B in the home. If anyone\nstands in Youth A’s way, he will become aggressive and punch or hit them.\nInterviews:\nThe Complainant was Anonymous.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/22/22. Director was\npresent for the interview. Staff 1 reported Youth A and Youth B are dating. He\nreported they typically sleep together in Youth A’s bedroom. Youth B was allowed\nentrance to Cebelak by the other males in the home who open the door for her\ndespite staff deterrence. When Youth B is in the home, staff must always supervise\nYouth A and Youth B together. If they are in Youth A's room together, staff must be\nsitting right at the door providing supervision.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/12/22 in conjunction\nwith the MDHHS worker. Director was present for the interview. Staff 2 reported\nif any two students are in a room alone together, a staff is supposed to be present\nand supervising constantly. Staff 2 reported there were additional requirements\nregarding Youth A and Youth B due to the established peer boundary plan, but there\nwas no requirement for a staff member to stand outside of Cebelak to ensure Youth\nB did not come to the home. Staff 2 reported on 7/23/22, the Supervisor and Staff 4\nleft Cebelak with another youth so she was the only staff member in the home with 4\nyouth, which meets their ratio requirement of 1:4. Staff 2 reported two youth were in\nthe milieu area, while Youth A and Youth B were in Youth A’s bedroom. Staff 2\n3",
    "reported she called Renucci to ask for an additional staff to come for support. Until\nanother staff came to the home, Staff 2 positioned herself where she could be in\nview of the hallway for the bedroom as well as the milieu, but she was unable to see\ninside of the bedroom. Staff 2 reported Youth A and Youth B were only in the\nbedroom together for a short time before another staff came to assist with\nsupervision. Staff 2 confirmed there is no time limit for how long youth can be alone\nbefore the continuous supervision requirement begins because supervision is\nsupposed to be constant. The video footage from 7/23/22 was reviewed with Staff 2\nduring the interview.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/12/22 in conjunction\nwith the MDHHS worker.

Staff 3 reported she sat in a chair at the\nbedroom door to supervise their interactions for the rest of the night, which was\nconsistent with the video footage reviewed.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/12/22 in conjunction\nwith the MDHHS worker. Director was present for the interview. Staff 4 reported\non 7/23/22, she was in the milieu area of Cebelak and then left Cebelak with another\nyouth.

Supervisor reported the end of May\n2022-beginning of June 2022 is when Youth B started to sleep in Youth A’s\nbedroom. There were peer boundaries plans and precautions put in place, which\nincluded staff verbally redirecting the youth, always supervising their interactions,\nand sitting at the door if they were in Youth A's bedroom together. Supervisor\nreported there was no requirement for a staff member to be standing outside of\nCebelak to ensure Youth B could not enter the home. On 7/23/22, Supervisor was\nfocusing on a different youth in the home and was unaware Youth A and Youth B\nwere ever alone together.\nYouth A was AWOL on 7/22/22 when a face-to-face interview was attempted.\nOn 7/25/22, Youth A was moved from the facility, went AWOL and has been AWOL\nsince then.

During\nface-to-face interviews with staff on 8/12/22, video footage of Cebelak home\non 7/23/22 was reviewed during each of the 3 interviews. The video footage is\nconsistent with Staff 2’s interview. There is approximately a 5–6-minute\ntimeframe in which Youth A and Youth B were unsupervised in Youth A’s\nbedroom prior to Staff 3 arriving at Cebelak and sitting in the bedroom door.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Youth A’s Mental Health & Behavioral Support Plan dated 5/11/22.\n Youth A’s Safety Plan dated 5/17/22 states Youth A should not have contact\nwith Youth B, which includes activities on campus.

Staff must\nalways be between Youth A and peers. Staff should not initiate any\ninteractions between Youth A and Youth B. Should the youth ignore peer\nboundary precaution, staff should stand between them and redirect all\ninappropriate conversations and boundary concerns. Staff should redirect\nthem back to their separate houses and remind them of what program\nexpectations are.\n Youth B’s Mental Health & Behavioral Support Plan dated 6/21/21.\n Youth B’s Safety Plan dated 1/21/22. Youth B will be able to participate in\ncampus activities with peers if demonstrating appropriate physical and social\nboundaries with male peers. Interactions must be highly supervised by staff to\nmonitor conversations.\n Youth B’s Clinical Assessment for Increased Checks (dated 7/4/22, 7/6/22 &\n7/15/22). Youth B is not following peer boundaries put into place and has\nbeen staying at Cebelak. Ordered increased checks while awake and\nsleeping.\n Incident report dated 7/23/22. Youth B laid in bed with Youth A and was\nreminded by Staff 2 they should not be sharing a bed or a blanket. Youth A\nlaid his head on Youth B’s chest. Supervisor removed blankets. Staff 2 and\nSupervisor reiterated peer boundary expectations. Youth A and Youth B\n5",
    "stayed in the same bed but used different blankets for the remainder of the\nnight.\n SI #2022C0103016 dated 7/5/22 and Approved CAP for SI dated 7/21/22.\n Student Supervision Procedure (rev. 4/1/21). To ensure appropriate\nsupervision, YDS & other agency staff responsible for students must:\n Know where each student is at all times\n Be physically present in close proximity to the student\n Maintain visual contact & monitoring of student\n Monitor interactions between students\n In situations when two students share a room, staff person will ensure\nstudents are maintaining appropriate physical distance from each other\nand that neither student is engaging in unsafe behavior. When 2\nstudents share a room, the staff person must maintain auditory\nmonitoring through the night, in addition to completing checks.\n Supervisor, Staff 3 and Staff 4’s personnel files were reviewed. There were\nno disciplinary records. Training records did not document completion of\ntraining on the Student Supervision Procedure.\n Staff 2’s personnel file was reviewed.

    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as there were not\nenough staff in Cebelak, which resulted in Youth A and Youth B\nbeing unsupervised. This violates the facility’s Student\nSupervision Procedure as well as the Peer Boundaries Plan and\nsafety plan established for Youth A and Youth B.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTraining records for 2 staff and 1 supervisor do not reflect\ntraining regarding the facility’s Student Supervision Procedure.\nTraining record for Staff 2 reflects completion of training on the\nStudent Supervision Procedure on 9/1/20, but the policy was\nrevised on 4/1/21 and no updated training is documented.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0103016; CAP approved 7/28/22\n2020C0223043; CAP approved 8/25/20\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend no changes be\nmade to the license status of this child caring institution.\n8/19/22\nShannon Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 25, 2022\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
