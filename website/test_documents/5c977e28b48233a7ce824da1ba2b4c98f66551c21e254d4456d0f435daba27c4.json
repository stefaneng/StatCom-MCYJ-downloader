    "MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\nDIVISION OF CHILD WELFARE LICENSING\nADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL LICENSING STUDY REPORT\nI. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\nLicense #: CI670290161\nLicensee Name: Eagle Village Inc\nLicensee Address: 4507 170th Avenue\nHersey, MI 49639\nLicensee Telephone #: (231) 832-2234\nAdministrator/Licensee Designee: Melissa Keating, Designee\nName of Facility: Eagle Village Hainley\nFacility Address: 17106 West Village Road\nHersey, MI 49639\nFacility Telephone #: (231) 832-7245\nCapacity: 27\nProgram Type: CHILD CARING INSTITUTION, PRIVATE\n1",
    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nEagle Village has decided to merge the license and contract for Eagle Village-\nHainley CI670290161 and Eagle Village-Leppien CI670383652.\nIII. Methodology\nReview of licensing record, contract amendments and discussion with both Program\nOffice and Division of Child Welfare Licensing.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nEagle Village encompasses a large campus with multiple buildings licensed under\nfive different child caring institution licenses. Eagle Village requested two licenses;\nHainley and Leppien become one. Both licenses provide the same programming\nand are both contracted for general residential care. Combining the licenses would\nprovide for flexibility in moving youth between the programs to better suit the ever\nchanging population dynamics.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend Hainley CI670290161 license remain open, increasing the capacity\nto 27 with both the Hainley house and Leppien house listed on the terms of the\nlicense and closing Leppien CI670383652 license.\nSeptember 23, 2020\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\nSeptember 30, 2020\n________________________________________\nDate\n2"
