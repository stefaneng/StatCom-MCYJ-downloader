    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program statement.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents’ needs, implementation of treatment plans,\nand discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation All youth placed were not supervised and as a result were able to\nbarricade themselves inside a bedroom and almost started a fire.\nInvestigation The Chief Administrator was interviewed on 02/20/2024 during\nan unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She confirmed\ninvolvement with the incident in question and stated it was she\nand Staff 1 that were present that day. The Chief Administrator\nrecalled the day this occurred was an unexpected snow day, so all\nthe youth were at the home in the morning instead of in school.\nThe Chief Administrator stated she attempted to create some\nactivities and structure for the day, and this included creating two\ngroups of youth with the intent to have good group dynamics and\nwork on some negative relationships between certain youth. The\nChief Administrator stated all of the youth declined to participate\nand almost immediately did not follow staff direction for the\nmorning. This resulted in Youth A, Youth B, Youth C and Youth D\ngoing upstairs to the bedroom of Youth B and Youth D. The Chief\nAdministrator recalled at that time Youth A and Youth C were not\nallowed to be in that room. She recalled asking the youth to leave\nthe bedroom and they refused. As the Chief Administrator and\nStaff 1 attempted to communicate with the youth in the bedroom,\nthey would periodically open and close the door. The Chief\nAdministrator stated she provided the best line of sight supervision\nthat she could. The Chief Administrator recalled this portion of the\nincident lasting a more extended amount of time and noted the\nyouth were not doing anything in particular other than engaging in\nage appropriate conversations and interactions. The Chief\nAdministrator stated she traded off with Staff 1 for responsibility of\nsupervising the youth. The Chief Administrator recalled the youth\nclosed the door at one point when Staff 1 was supervising them,\nand Staff 1 stated Law Enforcement would need to be called to do\n2",
    "a wellness check on the youth if the door was not ajar for her to\nsee them. The Chief Administrator believed the youth opened the\ndoor for Staff 1 at that point. She stated she was downstairs for\nthis portion of the incident, and she came back upstairs to hear\nthe youth talking about doing each other’s hair. The Chief\nAdministrator stated they were using a pressing comb; an\nelectrical hair tool that uses heat to straighten hair. The Chief\nAdministrator recalled this tool was creating visible smoke. She\nstated she stepped towards the doorway only for Youth B to tell\nher to “Shut the fuck up” and slam the bedroom door. The Chief\nAdministrator stated the youth then pushed a bed in front of their\nside of the door to barricade themselves in. She was not certain\nthis is what they did, but it was a reasonable speculation based on\nwhat she heard them saying and doing on the other side of the\ndoor. The Chief Administrator stated she was then concerned\nabout the youth’s activities inside the bedroom and with the recent\ndifficult dynamics between some of the youth, concerned about\nthe possibility that they would fight each other. To this point in the\nincident there had not been any discord noted between the youth\ninvolved. The Chief Administrator then called law enforcement to\nreport the activities and request assistance. It took a few minutes\nfor law enforcement to come to the scene, and the fire department\naccompanied them because of the concern of smoke coming from\nthe pressing comb. The Chief Administrator believed the youth\nmay have come out of the room before law enforcement arrived at\nthe scene. At this point the youth had exited the bedroom and\nthey all spoke with the authorities. The Chief Administrator then\ndescribed further events of the day after this occurred, including\nthe same four youth attempting a group AWOL together after they\ncreated a diversion for the Chief Administrator upstairs and Youth\nC attempting to speak with boys that went to her school over the\nphone, both of which were not successful.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 02/29/2024 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit at the facility. She recalled being a part of the\nincident in question. She stated Youth A, Youth B, Youth C and\nYouth D had proceeded to go up to one of the bedrooms upstairs\nduring a snow day when they were all at home. Staff 1 recalled\nthe youth were not allowed to do this and there were other\nactivities attempted. The youth were not escalated or misbehaving\nin any form at first. Staff 1 recalled the Chief Administrator asking\nthe youth to come out of that bedroom because it was against\nhouse rules and the youth refused to comply. Staff 1 statedthe\nfour youth ended up in one of their bedrooms. She then sat out in\nthe hallway near the south wall of the upstairs. Staff 1 stated she\nwould get up from her chair every 15 minutes and look into the\n3",
    "bedroom to see what was occurring, the door had been opened\nup to that point. Staff 1 recalled the Chief Administrator came\nupstairs after having contact with the License Designee, and the\nChief Administrator asked the youth to stop using a pressing comb\nto do each other’s hair as that was not an approved item for them\nto have in their possession. Staff 1 stated the comb was\nsupposed to be stored in the salon room on the first floor of the\nfacility and she was not sure why it was in the youth’s possession.\nStaff 1 stated she was not aware the youth were using that comb\nat first but eventually it was evident because there was a smoking\nsmell coming from the room. Staff 1 recalled the youth then\nslammed the bedroom door in the Chief Administrator’s face and\nattempted to block entry to the bedroom by sliding a bed against\nthe door. Staff 1 also recalled the youth closing the door only for\nStaff 1 to re-open it, and this occurred successively. Staff 1\nrecalled the fire department and law enforcement coming to the\nfacility at this point after the Chief Administrator had called them.\nSaff 1 stated the youth came out of the room and spoke with law\nenforcement and the fire department and they were de-escalated.\nYouth E was interviewed on 02/29/2024 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit at the facility. She stated she was not in the\nroom with the other youth when this incident occurred because\nshe was quarantining in her own bedroom after being diagnosed\nwith COVID-19. Youth E stated she heard commotion and would\npeak her head out of her bedroom on multiple occasions to see\nwhat was going on. On several instances of doing this Youth E\nstated she could see the bedroom door open and could hear the\nother youth in this bedroom and saw Staff 1 sitting at the end of\nthe hallway. Youth E stated there was one specific time that she\ndid not see Staff 1 or the Chief Administrator upstairs with the\nother youth.\nYouth B was interviewed on 02/29/2024 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit at the facility. She stated she took part in the\nincident in question. Youth B recalled being in the bedroom with\nYouth A, Youth C and Youth D. Youth B stated she did not think\nthere was anything wrong with what she and her peers were doing\nbecause they go in and out of each other’s bedrooms frequently.\nYouth B stated she had a pressing comb in her possession during\nher entire stay at the facility and no one had told her she could not\nhave it. Youth B stated she and Youth A, Youth C and Youth D\nwere doing each other’s hair on the morning in question and she\nperiodically saw Staff 1 and the Chief Administrator come in and\nout of the bedroom they were in. Youth B recalled the Chief\nAdministrator seeing them do each other’s hair and use the\n4",
    "pressing comb and at one point commenting, “Okay, that looks\ngood” and “Y’all gonna continue to do your hair.” Youth B felt like\nthe Chief Administrator was “picking” on them as she later asked\nthem to stop and leave the room. As a result, she and the other\nyouth decided to close the door to the bedroom and push a bed\nagainst it so staff could not come in. Youth B recalled Youth C\nwas using the pressing comb on Youth A’s hair. After this, Youth\nB heard Staff 1 state to them law enforcement could be called if\nthe youth did not come out of the bedroom. Youth B stated no\none tried to open the bedroom door after they slid the bed against\nit. Youth B stated a few minutes went by when she heard sirens\noutside, and all of the youth came out of the room to go look out of\nthe front of the building, which can be seen through the south\nwindow in the upstairs hallway. Youth B stated this was when she\nsaw law enforcement and the fire department outside. Youth B\nstated she spoke with the fire department and law enforcement.\nYouth C was interviewed over the phone at her new placement on\n03/15/2024. She confirmed she was involved in the incident in\nquestion. Youth C stated she was upstairs in a bedroom with\nYouth A, Youth B and Youth D for most of the morning. She\nrecalled doing hair with the other youth, and one of the tools that\nwas used was a pressing comb. Youth C stated the Chief\nAdministrator came into the bedroom a couple times, and another\nstaff member that she could not recall would stick her head in and\nsay “Just checking in” every 15 minutes or so. She recalled one\nof the staff members asking them to not close the bedroom door.\nYouth C then recalled that the Chief Administrator did ask them to\nleave the bedroom when they first went upstairs but the youth\nchose not to. Youth C did not believe either staff had told them\nnot to use the pressing comb and that it was already in the room\nwhen they came upstairs. Youth C recalled the bed being pushed\nagainst the door to the bedroom to not allow staff to come in, and\nthen shortly thereafter the fire department came to the house to\nspeak with the youth. Youth C stated she left the bedroom at this\npoint.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• An Incident Report dated 02/15/2024 was provided and\nreviewed. This was authored by the Chief\nAdministrator. This incident report is consistent with the\ninterview provided by the Chief Administrator. It detailed\nthat several youth were in a bedroom unauthorized and that\nstaff had asked them to leave several times. The youth\nwere asked to unplug the straightening comb that was\nbeing used, and this caused them to become upset. The\n5",
    "youth refused and they put a bed behind the door to\nprevent access. 911 was contacted to request assistance\nwith a wellness check and they were informed there was a\nsmoke smell coming from the closed bedroom. Law\nenforcement and the fire department arrived at the facility\nshortly thereafter.\n• Security camera footage of parts of the incident was\nprovided and viewed. Because of the limitations of the\nfacility’s camera system there were only 20 second clips\navailable. The video clips showed youth coming and going\nfrom bedrooms upstairs and Staff 1 was upstairs in the\nhallway. The clips culminate with footage of three of the\nyouth coming out of a bedroom to come to the window at\nthe end of the hallway, and the youth then witnessed law\nenforcement arriving to the house. It was not apparent that\nthere was a staff member present upstairs for the entirety\nof the incident. A clip minutes later showed the Chief\nAdministrator upstairs with law enforcement.\n• Youth B’s case file was reviewed and there was no\ndocumentation found that indicated a list of prohibited items\nwas provided to her including a similar hair product to the\none involved in the incident.\no A template form for the facilities “Intake Checklist”\nwas provided and reviewed. On this lists items that\nare not allowed in the facility, but nothing similar to\nthe hair straightening tool is included in this list. In\naddition, this form is kept in the case file for the\nyouth, and it was not clear this was provided directly\nto the youth for their information at intake.\n• Facility policy dated 01/14/2024 was reviewed.\no A section of this policy titled “Care & Safety”\ndescribes the supervision requirements of staff. This\npolicy stated “The primary job of all staff is to always\nmaintain adequate coverage and line of sight of all\nyouth. This means that youth are never left\nunattended for any amount of time so that behaviors\nare supervised.”\no In the same section it was described that “no\nresident is to enter another resident’s room. The only\nperson’s that are allowed in the sleeping rooms will\nbe staff and the assigned youth. Therefore, no other\nyouth should be in another youth’s sleeping room.”\no There is no narrative in the facility policies and\nprocedures that outlines what items are prohibited in\nthe facility.\n6",
    "Analysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was evidence found that the facility did not follow\nits own policies and procedures regarding the supervision of youth\nwhen they were in an upstairs bedroom together.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The Chief Administrator reported that she and Staff 1 had\naccess to walkie talkies during the incident, but they were\nnot fully functional at that moment. Ensuring there are\nbackups for devices like these is advised.\n• Clarity and documentation are needed for house rules.\nMultiple youth in the investigation claimed they did not\nknow about house rules regarding who was allowed in what\nbedroom or what items they were not allowed to have in\ntheir possession, and written policy of this was not clear.\nConsultation provided:\n• During the interview with the Chief Administrator, she was\nadvised to instruct staff members who work overnights and\nsupervise the youth while sleeping to be mindful of where\nthey sit. If staff sit in a chair against the wall where the\nsecurity camera is located, they cannot be seen. If they sit\na few feet forward, they can be seen in security footage\nand clarity would be achieved on whether they were\npresent or not during any given situation.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2023C0000695 dated 10/05/2023, CAP approved11/16/2023.\nSIR 2024C0001037SI dated 04/18/2024 CAP pending.\n7",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Based on the findings in this report a CAP is required.\nPer SIR #2024C0001037SI, a 1st provisional license is recommended.\n03/20/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/18/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n8"
