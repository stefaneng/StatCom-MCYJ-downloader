    "DCWL ANALYST ISSUES ADDRESSED:\nThe Analyst’s inspection completion was still pending at the time of completion of the\nagency’s renewal inspection. One safety alert was indicated:\nConcern:\nThe 17-year-old foster child is sleeping in the basement and there isn’t means of\negress. The family lives in an apartment.\nSolution:\nThe agency reports the caregiver and children reside in a townhouse not an apartment.\nThe home has two-bedrooms. This is the home the children resided in with their birth\nparent prior to the agency’s involvement in the case. The birth parent moved out and\nthe maternal grandmother moved in with the children. During that earlier time, the 17-\nyear-old youth had slept in the basement by choice; reportedly for the privacy it offered.\nThis was all prior to the agency’s acceptance of the case on 5/5/2021. Currently and\nsince the agency’s acceptance of the case, the 17-year-old youth occupies one of the\ntwo bedrooms in the home. The grandmother and the three younger children, ages,\none, two and three share the other bedroom. All the occupants have beds. As for\narrangement for the future, the 17-year-old youth will be 18 on 2/2/2022. He plans to\nask the court at the next hearing for permission to be removed from the case. He will\nmove from the home; he wants to return to the birth mother.\nRECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n01/23/2022\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Date\nLicensing Consultant\n10",
