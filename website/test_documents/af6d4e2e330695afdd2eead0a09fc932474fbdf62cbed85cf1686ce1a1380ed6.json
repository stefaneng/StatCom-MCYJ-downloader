    "II. ALLEGATION(S)\nViolation\nEstablished?\nFacility admitted youth and administered psychotropic medication Yes\nwithout parental consent.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n12/15/2020 Special Investigation Intake\n2021C0223010\n12/15/2020 Special Investigation Initiated - Telephone\nTelephone call with Director of Quality and Risk\n12/16/2020 Contact - Telephone call made\nInterview and discussion investigation and reviewed requirements\n12/16/2020 Exit Conference\nDiscussed findings with Director Quality and Risk.\nALLEGATION:\nFacility admitted youth and administered psychotropic medication without parental\nconsent.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed the Director of Quality and Risk on December 11, 2020 after being\ncontacted by her with concerns of an informed consent. Director of Quality and Risk\nreported Youth A was admitted on November 30, 2020 after hours. He is prescribed\nthree psychotropic medications, but the foster care worker did not provide the\ninformed consent upon admission. The foster care worker agreed to provide the\nadmission paperwork the following day but has not done so. St. John’s home has\nbeen administering all three psychotropic medications to Youth A since admission\nwithout an informed consent on file. Director of Quality and Risk acknowledged the\nfacility should not have admitted and/or administered Youth A the psychotropic\nmedication without the informed consent. Director of Quality and Risk was seeking\nconsultation on how to move forward to rectify the issue in the safest way possible\nas the medication should not be discontinued abruptly but titrated off. Director of\nQuality and Risk had already contacted the foster care agency and contractor to\ndiscuss obtaining consent immediately or the medication would need to be\ndiscontinued.\nI reviewed Youth A’s MiSACWIS case record. He entered care on October 22,\n2020. He was admitted to St. John’s Home on November 30, 2020. In review of the\ncase record Youth A is prescribed three psychotropic medications and there are no\ninformed consents located in the case file.\n2",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 802-1 PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN FOSTER CARE\nConsent is required for the prescription and use of all\npsychotropic medications for all children in foster care and\nfor children placed for adoption where the court has not\nissued an order finalizing the adoption.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as they administered\nmedication to Youth A without an informed consent.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan; no changes\nbe made to the status of the license of this child caring institution.\nDecember 16, 2020\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 17, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n3"
