The facility would randomly give Youth A zeros for\nclasses however there were times she was at those classes and\nwould give her points when she was not at class. Youth A\nreported she did eventually start going to class as the principal\nthreatened to expel or suspend her if she did not.

    "Administrator 3 was interviewed via telephone on 8/22/2023.\nAdministrator 3 reported she is a trainer of Safe Crisis\nManagement (SCM) at the facility. The facility trains escort\ntechniques which include an extended arm escort, a hook escort,\na hook carry escort, and a cradle carry escort. The hook carry\nescort is where two staff hook the youth at the armpit area with\ntheir arms and walk quickly causing the youth’s feet to drag as\nthey move. Administrator 3 reported this would be used in\nsituations when a youth is not cooperating and is in an unsafe\nsituation. The cradle carry escort is where one staff is behind the\nyouth and the staff’s chest is facing the youth’s back. The staff\nplaces their arms under the youth’s forearm area and secures the\nyouth’s arms just above the wrist and another staff lifts the youth’s\nlegs off the ground. In these two escorts the youth is lifted off the\nground and carried to a location. Administrator 3 reported staff at\nthe facility are permitted to use hook carry and cradle carry escort\nholds. Administrator 3 reported these are not typical techniques\nused at the facility as there would not be any situations within the\nhouse that would need this type of intervention however an\nexample of when this would be used appropriately would be when\na youth is in the road and are in an unsafe situation. Administrator\n3 reported if staff felt they needed to get Youth B into the car for\nsafety that it would be appropriate to use the cradle carry escort.\nAdministrator 3 reported the facilities internal policy in SCM policy\nand procedure where it states emergency restraint is prohibited to\nbe used to gain compliance refers to a youth refusing to go to the\ngym as an example, not a safety situation.\nMDHHS worker did not have any findings in this\ninvestigation.\nThe complainant is this consultant as during interviews\nYouth A and Youth B reported improper restraint techniques\nused.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth Opportunity Program Description New Hope Youth\nCenter: Safe Crisis Management (SCM) is the verbal and\nphysical intervention program trained and used.

In these two escorts the youth\nis lifted off the ground and carried to a location. Administrator 3\nreported staff at the facility are permitted to use hook and carry\nand cradle and carry escort holds. Administrator 3 reported these\nare not typical techniques used at the facility as there would not\nbe any situations within the house that would need this type of\nintervention however an example of when this would be used\nappropriately would be when a youth is in the road and are in an\nunsafe situation. Administrator 3 reported if staff felt they needed\nto get Youth B into the car for safety that it would be appropriate to\nuse the cradle and carry.\nMDHHS worker did not have any findings in this\ninvestigation.\nThe complainant is this consultant as during interviews staff\nreported placing Youth B in two separate escorts and\nexplained the escort holds as lifting Youth B off the ground\nwhile her arms were secure to try to put Youth B in the car as\nYouth B was refusing to return to the facility on her own free\nwill.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• PA 116: “Personal restraint” means the application of\nphysical force without the use of a device, for the purpose\nof restraining the free movement of a minor child’s body.\nPersonal restraint does not include holding a minor child’s\nhand, wrist, shoulder, or arm to safely escort him or her\nfrom one area to another.\n• SCM Manual: Escort/transports can be completed by a\nsingle or multiple staff which is a technique used to move a\nyouth from one location to another. SCM includes carry\ntransport assists including a two-person cradle carry\ntransport assist where the youth’s balance is interrupted by\nstaff rocking forward and shifting bodyweight to their trailing\nleg to allow more room for the assisting staff to pick up the\nindividuals legs. Both the youth’s legs are picked up near\nthe knees, staff walk forward and once the youth is in the\ndesired location, the youth’s feet are placed on the floor.\nThe three-person cradle carry transport is the same\nconcept as the two-person however has two staff securing\nthe youth’s legs. The three-person hook carry transport\nassist is when two staff interrupt the youth’s balance by\nrocking slightly while having the youth’s arms secured by\n44",
    "one staff on each side in the hook transport hold and the\nthird staff enters to lift the youth legs off the ground near\nthe knee area.\n• Youth Opportunity Incident Report for Youth B dated\n7/28/2023 at 10:57pm does not document Youth B being\nplaced in the three-person hook carry transport or the two-\nperson cradle carry transport.\n• There were not MiSACWIS or Youth Opportunity Incident\nReports for Youth B dated 7/28/2023 that addressed the\nthree-person hook carry transport, or the two-person cradle\ncarry transport.\n• Youth Opportunity New Hope Youth Center Policies and\nProcedures Safe Crisis Management and Physical\nIntervention: Emergency restraint is not allowed to force a\nyouth into compliance. Emergent physical restraint may\nproceed if a youth is actively attempting to hurt self or\nothers or is a serious threat of safety or violence to self or\nothers and/or after all verbal de-escalation and behavior\nsupport techniques have been exhausted.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance as the facility placed Youth\nB in two restraints that were unwarranted. Based on interviews,\nYouth B was placed in two separate “escorts” per the facility\nhowever per PA 116 these “escorts” are considered restraints as\nper PA 116 definition of “personal restraint” as Youth B did not\nhave free movement of her body as she was lifted off the ground\nby staff and attempted to be placed into the vehicle. Both\nincidents were unwarranted as Youth B did not require a lifesaving\nresponse nor was Youth B demonstrating behaviors that placed\nthe youth or others at serious threat of violence or injury at the\ntime Youth B was placed in these restraints. Youth B was initially\nsitting on the grass refusing to move when placed in the three-\nperson hook carry transport assist and the second Youth B was\nrefusing to return to the facility after being released from a supine\nrestraint and was placed in a two-person cradle carry transport\nassist.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt was recommended the facility update internal policy to include\nescorts/transports where free movement of a youth’s body is\nrestrained to be labeled as restraints.\nIt was recommended the facility update Youth Opportunity New\nHope Youth Center Policies and Procedures Safe Crisis\nManagement and Physical Intervention where it states emergent\nphysical restraint may proceed if all verbal de-escalation and\nbehavior support techniques have been exhausted as this is not\nusing restraint as a lifesaving response.\n45",
    "It was recommended staff be retrained on escort/transport holds\ntrained by the facility and educated on these techniques where the\nyouth’s free movement of their body are restraints and restraint\nreporting requirements are required in these situations.\nIt was recommended the facility complete incident reporting\ntraining with staff as neither of these techniques were documented\nas occurring on the internal incident reports.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n8/31/2023\n______________________________________\nJennifer Pastorick Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 12, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n46"
