    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following area.\n The facility is providing additional training on issues including updated policies\nand procedures as laid out in the corrective action plans. However, they were\nnot requiring staff to sign into the training and losing the documentation to\nprove that specific staff are being trained. This was discussed and they will\nbegin to require sign-in sheets for any training even if it is conducted at short\nnotice.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not seek consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThe facility has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first submitted corrective action plan was in response to the special investigation\nreport 2021C0214003 initiated on 10/16/2020. This involved allegations of staff\nplacing their hand on a resident’s neck and the other hand on the resident’s groin\narea. After an investigation involving face-to-face interviews, a review of written\ndocumentation and a review of a video recording it was determined that staff did not\nprovide the form of behavior management that is part of the policy/procedures for this\nfacility. There were additional findings that the staff did not follow the policy/procedure\nof room/security checks and setting a positive role model for residents. The facility\nsubmitted a CAP on 11/19/20 which was approved on 12/1/20. This CAP involved a\nwritten reprimand for the staff identified, a period of 90-days for additional supervision\nfor the identified staff with a written evaluation at the end of the 90-days, additional\ntraining on the policy/procedures that cover the allegations, and an updating of the\npolicy/procedures that cover staff providing room supervision for residents.\nThe second submitted corrective action plan was in response to the special\ninvestigation report 2021C0207006 initiated on 1/13/2021. This special investigation\ninvolved allegations of a staff member hitting a youth with an open hand. After an\ninvestigation involving face-to-face interviews, a review of written documentation and\na review of a video recording it was determined that staff did strike the resident in the\nface with the back of his hand. The facility submitted a CAP on 3/12/21 which was\napproved on 3/24/21. This CAP involved a written reprimand for the identified staff,\n4",
    "updating the policy/procedure for corporal punishment, and staff training on the new\npolicy/procedure.\nThe third submitted corrective action plan was in response to the Annual Licensing\nInspection that occurred on 7/15/2020.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy. It is\nrecommended that the facility be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n3/29/2021\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 29, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
