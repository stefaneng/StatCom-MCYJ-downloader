The addendum must reflect significant changes and child\ndevelopment updates from the previous assessment. The\naddendum must provide current information that would be\nsignificant to a prospective adoptive family.\nContracted adoption agencies must forward a copy of the child\nassessment addendum to the local DHHS adoption monitor\nwithin five calendar days of completion, for inclusion in the\nchild’s permanent record.\nDistribution\nThe adoption worker or assigned DHHS monitor must provide a\ncopy of the child assessment addendum to the foster care\nworker.\nTwo of eight Adoption case files reviewed did not have the DHHS-606 completed in\na timely manner.

The first case file had four quarterly reports still in progress\nand not approved. The second case file three quarterly reports completed until 3, 2,\nand 2 months late.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Several of the employee files reviewed had documentation of the “employee\ncheck list” present but the form was blank. It was discussed that this would\nnot provide the needed documentation to ensure that the appropriate\norientation had taken place.\n Several coding issues of uploaded documentation were found. The agency\nwas not coding (labeling) each document the same each time. The agency\nagreed that this has been a concern and they will develop a method to ensure\nthis is corrected in the future.\n Two of the special evaluations reviewed did not have documentation of the\nagency’s procedure for monitoring the progress of the foster parents efforts to\ncomplete the corrective action plan. In the first, the foster parents were not\nable to schedule the required training for several months but there was no\naction documented that would take place to ensure safety for the children\nduring that time. The second involved a similar situation and there was no\ndocumentation of the agency monitoring until the task was completed. The\nagency agreed and will develop the monitoring aspect in their corrective\naction plans.\n Several service plans of youth in the refugee program had reports present\nand the only documentation in the worker signature section was “CM no\nlonger works at the BCS”. It was discussed that a supervisor should have\nsigned the reports, with a manager approving, rather than having no worker\nsignature.\n Several social work contacts between the worker, youth and foster parents\ndid not identified the foster parents as participants; however, they were\nidentified in the narrative. The agency reported that they have been leaving\nthis information out because when the bio-parents get a copy of the report\nthey also gain the foster parents names. Different ways of resolving this issue\nwere discussed and the agency will seek a solution.\n15",
    " One of the closed files in the refugee program did not have the discharge\nreport completed within 30-days however, because this is not a state\ncontracted program, no violation was found, and technical assistance was\nprovided.\n Two employee files reviewed did not have dates on the references within the\nfile. This was brought to discussion and the agency will examine ways of\ndeveloping a system of checking for dates on all documents.\n A significant majority of adoption family assessments reviewed indicated they\nwere unable to make a recommendation due to missing documents. This is\nan unusually high percentage. Rule 605 outlines everything that is to be\nincluded in the evaluation. If any pieces are missing after diligent and\ndocumented efforts, then the report can indicate such, but this should be the\nrare exception. This issue was discussed, and the agency will look into\nmaking changes in this area.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following area:\n The agency informed the consultant that they no longer had a full-time individual\nconducting compliance inspections with the agency. It was suggested that this is\na position that they would need to maintain in order to ensure that the action\nsteps of their upcoming CAP are completed. This would also ensure that they are\nfollowing the guidelines of their accreditation. The agency agreed to examine\nways of ensuring that this position is filled.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nCurrently there are two active special investigations which have not be concluded:\n16",
    "The first active special investigation (2021C0212002) was initiated on 10/13/20 and\ninvolves the following allegations.
