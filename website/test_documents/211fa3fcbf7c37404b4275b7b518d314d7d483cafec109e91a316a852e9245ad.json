    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Education\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4123\nSection (2) Provision shall be made for an appropriate education program\nDescription in accordance with 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1853. Each\nresident of school age shall be enrolled not later than 5 school\ndays after admission and continuously thereafter.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youths at facility do not receive special education services or earn\ntransferrable credits or high school diplomas.\nInvestigation I was assigned this investigation on 3/13/24.\nInterviews:\nI contacted Complainant requesting specific names of youths\nimpacted by the allegations. She alleged Youth T, Youth E and\nFormer Youth O are not and/or did not receive special education\nat the facility and all have expired IEPs. Complainant expressed a\nconcern that Youth J, Youth T and Former Youth O are not or did\nnot earn credits at Havenwyck that transfer to other schools.\nComplainant further claimed Former Youth O had an IEP due in\nNov 2023 and felt Havenwyck was responsible for getting it done.\nI notified Chief Administrator (CA) of the allegations requesting\ninformation regarding their compliance with the Michigan School\nCode referred to in the applicable licensing rule.\nI interviewed CA, Teacher 1 and Teacher 2 together via\nconference call on 3/14/24. They denied the allegations were true\nand reported that Pontiac Public School District is responsible to\nprovide Individualized Education Planning (IEP) services to the\nyouths referred to them by Havenwyck. CA stated, “All youths\nleave Havenwyck with an accurate transcript.” Depending on their\nperformance, youths can earn transferable credits and/or high\nschool diplomas which would be awarded by Pontiac Public\nSchool District or the youth’s high school of origin. CA mentioned\nshe had already conversed with Complainant about her concerns.\nShe believes the Complainant misunderstood the responsibilities\nand limitations of a child caring institution.\n2",
    "Teacher 1 stated referral forms are completed at the beginning of\neach school year. Havenwyck completes a form for each youth\nidentified as having had a previous IEP or disability. These forms\nare sent to Pontiac Public Schools and Havenwyck waits for a\nresponse. Due to lingering effects of the COVID epidemic,\nTeacher 1 said Pontiac Public Schools has had staffing issues\nand sometimes been unresponsive to requests by Havenwyck\nteachers on behalf of their students. Teacher 1 and Teacher 2\nsaid they are particularly frustrated with the district as an\nexpressed need for re-classification of Youth T from (EI)\nEmotionally Impaired to Cognitively Impaired (CI) has been\ndelayed.\nI consulted with the current and former licensing consultants\nassigned to the facility. Neither were aware of any previous\nlicensing concerns relative to youth education.\nOn 3/19/24, I met onsite for three hours with CA, Teacher 1 and\nTeacher 2. CA has worked at the facility for 29 years, Teacher 1\nfor over two years and Teacher 2 for over one year. They\nprovided the following information verbally:\nHavenwyck School is considered a “non-public school” similar to a\nreligious school. The facility has a licensing capacity of 30 with a\ncurrent census of 28. Each classroom has one teacher, two adult\nteaching assistants and one tutor for up to 15 students. School\nwork is tailored to meet each student’s individual needs at their\nfunctioning grade level in each subject through “differential\nlearning,” a computer lab and 1:2 tutoring. The special needs of\nstudents classified as Emotionally Impaired (EI) are met 24/7\nthrough clinical services and the treatment-oriented milieu\nencompassed within the residential program.\nWhereas public schools employ psychologists who test, and re-\ntest identified students every three years to determine special\neducation eligibility and other professionals who arrange Individual\nEducation Planning Committee (IEPC) meetings and write reports\nfor students identified with disabilities, Havenwyck School does\nhave these capabilities and do not employ school psychologists or\nother professionals required for IEPCs. To determine eligibility for\nspecial education for its students, Havenwyck must rely on the\nlocal public school district.\nDocuments reviewed:\n3",
    "• Michigan School Code statute 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to\n380.1853 – State of Michigan electronic data base.\n• Youth T, Youth E, Youth J and Former Youth O’s educational\nrecords at Havenwyck including report cards and earned credits –\npaper files. Youth education records indicate Havenwyck provides\nits students an education that is tailored to their current grades\nand level of functioning through differential learning, computer lab,\nand tutoring. Report cards and credits are earned.\n• MISACWIS – State of Michigan electronic data base: MISACWIS\nindicates the following MDHHS-referred youths were admitted to\nHavenwyck:\nYouth E was admitted on 6/24/21 - present.\nYouth T was admitted on 1/23/23 – present.\nYouth J was admitted on 6/7/22 - present.\nFormer Youth O was admitted on 1/18/24 and discharged on\n3/8/24. Not only was I unable to confirm from the youth’s closed\nfile that an IEP was due last November, but records indicate Youth\nO was at Hawthorn at that time. Records also indicate Former\nYouth O only resided at Havenwyck for seven weeks.\n• CWLM – State of Michigan electronic data base: CWLM\nindicates Havenwyck Impulse Control Disorder has been a\nlicensed child caring institution for 31 years. Paris Miller, PhD.\nassumed the chief administrator role in Jan 2022.\nI reviewed 2023/2024 Pontiac Schools referral forms prepared by\nHavenwyck teachers requesting assessments and determinations\nfor their students with histories of special needs.\nAnalysis Havenwyck collaborates with and must rely on an outside source\n(Pontiac Public School District) to perform IEPs and annual\nevaluations on Havenwyck students. According to Havewyck\nteachers, Pontiac School District is not always responsive to their\nverbal and written requests for services for their students.\nTeacher interviews and youth education records indicate\nHavenwyck provides its students an education that is tailored to\ntheir current grades and level of functioning.\nWhile it is true Havenwyck School does not issue high school\ndiplomas, it is possible to earn a high school diploma awarded by\nPontiac School District or that youth’s high school of origin.\n4",
    "In terms of Former Youth O lacking an updated IEP, it was not\nrealistic to expect Havenwyck and Pontiac Schools to have\ncompleted the entire process in the seven weeks Youth O was at\nthe facility.\nAt this time, there is no evidence indicating Havenwyck School is\nin violation of the licensing rule or 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to\n380.1853.\nCONSULTATION\nI strongly recommended CA and both teachers meet in-person\nwith the superintendent of Pontiac Schools to re-establish a\nproductive working relationship to ensure that the IEP needs of\napplicable students at Havenwyck are being met.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 9, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 19, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n5"
