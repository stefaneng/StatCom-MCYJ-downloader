She reported having received a phone call on\n7/31/2025 from Independent Living (IL) Supervisor who reported\nYouth A had been taken to the emergency room by ambulance\ndue to complaints of feeling nauseous. IL Supervisor called IL\nProgram Manager back a little later stating that Youth A was being\ndischarged from the emergency room and she needed a ride\nback to the independent living home. IL Program Manager and IL\nSupervisor discussed Youth A’s transportation options such as\nutilizing the service through the number listed on the back of\nYouth A’s Medicaid card, walking, ride share, or riding with her\nboyfriend who was with her at the hospital. IL Supervisor called IL\nProgram Manager a third time stating the hospital staff were not\nok with any of the transportation options suggested by IL\nSupervisor. IL Program Manager stated the agency’s independent\nliving youth have used these methods in the past when being\ndischarged from the same hospital, so she was unsure why there\nwere concerns this time. IL Program Manager stated she was told\nsomeone from the hospital drove Youth A back to the independent\nliving home. She stated Youth A’s boyfriend followed them in his\ncar and, when they got to the home, Youth A got out of the\nhospital staff’s vehicle and got into her boyfriend’s car and left. IL\nProgram Manager stated she does not know why the hospital did\nnot allow Youth A to leave the hospital with her boyfriend.\nIndependent Living (IL) Supervisor was interviewed by phone\non 8/7/2025. She stated, on 7/31/2025, Youth A called an\nambulance and went to the emergency room reporting she had\nbeen having diarrhea and was vomiting for four days. IL\nSupervisor stated Youth A was given Zofran, Benadryl, and pain\nmedication before being discharged from the emergency room. IL\nSupervisor stated a hospital staff member called her stating Youth\nA was ready for discharge and to return to the independent living\nhome. IL Supervisor explained Youth A is an independent living\nyouth and told the hospital staff Youth A had a bus pass, could\ncall the transportation service number on her Medicaid card, could\nuse ride share, or she could ride with her boyfriend who was at the\nhospital with her.

The staff member told Community Health\nWorker that Youth A lives independently and needs to find a ride\nusing her resources.

Community Health Worker stated she requested\nassistance from the hospital transportation service and waited with\nher for several hours until the transporter was available.\nCommunity Health Worker was asked why none of the\ntransportation options presented by the staff of the independent\nliving home and IL Supervisor were utilized to which Community\nHealth Worker responded Youth A’s medical providers did not feel\nany of them were appropriate because the medication Youth A\nwas given made her drowsy and she kept falling asleep. When\nasked why Youth A could not ride home with her boyfriend,\nCommunity Health Worker stated her boyfriend was never at the\nhospital with Youth A. She stated the medical providers did not\nfeel it was a safe option to call Youth A’s boyfriend to provide\ntransportation to Youth A due to the medication making her so\n3",
