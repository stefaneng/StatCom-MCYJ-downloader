    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance:\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency submitted one acceptable corrective action plan in response to the interim\ninspection completed 4/10/2024 with a corrective action plan approved on\n5/8/2024. The agency was in violation with Rules 12418 (2) (a), 12418 (2) (b) and\nPolicy 722.06B. The agency does not have any repeat violations with these rules\nduring this reporting period.\nThe agency had one special investigation SI#2024SIC001299, that was initiated\non 4/2/2024. The report was completed on 5/30/2024 and CAP approved on\n8/7/2024. The agency was in violation with Rule 12207 (3) (a). The agency has\nnot had any repeat violations of this rule.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nChief Administrator (CA) reported one of their biggest barriers is receiving youths\ninto their program and the previous agency not completing the youth report from\nthat reporting period. This process affects their program because Spectrum case\nmanagers have to complete the report even after accepting the case for a brief\ntime period. CA reported Spectrum case managers have to make a statement in\nthe report that Spectrum is only able to report the progress from the date the youth\nentered into their Spectrum IL program. She identified another barrier as youth\nfunding changing to YAVFC and the case not opening in a timely manner. She\nreported this causes late reports. She said it occurs often, and the case managers\nenter a social work contact in the cases of their many attempts to rectify the\nissues. CA said on a positive note, the case managers are encouraged to make\ncase service plans a priority and the director will monitor cases to assist the case\nmanagers and hope to reach compliance of 100%.\nFinancial Overview:\nThe agency Independent Auditors’ Report dated 9/30/23 and 2022, and the annual\nfinancial budget report were reviewed. No financial concerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews:\nThree staff were interviewed via telephone. All staff reported accolades and\nsupport for their supervisors and the agency administration. All staff reported\ngetting the training they need to complete their job responsibilities. The staff\nwould not change anything about the program and reported they love working for\nthe agency. No concerns were reported.",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through:\nThe agency has adequate space and equipment to complete required\nresponsibilities. CHRI is stored securely (locked) that prevent unauthorized\naccess.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis agency is not contracted with MDHHS to provide foster care placement or\ncertification services, therefore this is not applicable.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes. It is recommended that the agency be issued a renewal of their\nregular license.\n3/13/2025\n___________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n3/14/2025\n_____________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
