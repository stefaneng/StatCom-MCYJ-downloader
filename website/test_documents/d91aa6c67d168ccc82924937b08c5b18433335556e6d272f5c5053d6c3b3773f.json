Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nAgency staff member returned youth to parent on 1/07/22 without a court order. The\nyouth was later moved from the father's home to a foster home without a removal\norder. The foster home's licensed was closed when this occurred.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews\nOn 3/17/2022 I received a complaint filed through the on-line complaint allegation\nsystem alleging that Foster Care Worker returned Youth A to the father, Parent A on\n01/07/2022 without a court order. In the meantime, the foster family with whom\nYouth A had been previously placed, closed their license. Parent A relapsed and\nFoster Care Worker removed Youth A from Parent A, without a removal order, and\nplaced Youth A with Foster Family whose license was voluntarily closed on\n01/23/2022. Foster Family’s license reopened on 02/04/2022. The concern is that\nthe child was returned to the father without an order into an illegal placement. Then\nthe child was removed from that father again without an order and placed into an\nunrelated, unlicensed home without an order.\nOn 3/24/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker, Supervisor, and Program Manager\nin person at their agency.\nFoster Care Worker reported that at the August and November 2021 court hearings,\ndiscussions were had regarding reunification with Parent A. During the November\ncourt hearing, discussion took place about returning to Parent A once he obtained\n2",
    "childcare and family reunification services were established. Foster Care Worker\nstated that once these two things were achieved, Youth A was moved from Foster\nParents’ home and placed with Parent A. After Youth A was moved, Foster Parents\nvoluntarily closed their license. Foster Care Worker stated Parent A had a substance\nabuse relapse while Youth A was in his care, so Foster Care Worker contacted the\ncourt regarding issuing a new removal order to which the court responded that no\norder was needed since there was no order replacing Youth A with Parent A. Foster\nCare Worker stated she didn’t realize until this time that the November court order\nstated an Order as Prayed was required prior to returning Youth A to Parent A.\nFoster Care Worker reported the court referee told her that the placement with\nParent A would be considered an extended parenting time. Foster Care Worker\nreported Youth A was again removed from Parent A and replaced with Foster\nFamily, who did not have a license to provide care for foster children. Foster Care\nWorker reported when she spoke to the court about this placement, they stated that\nthey would consider the placement to be a “bridge” placement.\nProgram Manager stated that placing the youth with the unlicensed foster parent\nwas in the best interest of the child rather than placing him with a licensed family he\ndid not know, which was why that placement decision was made. Program Manager\nand Supervisor reported that this situation was a “learning opportunity” for their\nagency as this isn’t anything they have previously encountered.\nDocuments Reviewed\nOn 4/4/2022 I reviewed the following in Youth A’s MiSACWIS case record:\n Placement History\n- 5/20/2021 – 1/7/2022 Foster Family\n- 1/7/2022 - 1/26/2022 Parent A\n- 1/26/2022 – Foster Family (unlicensed)\n- 2/4/2022 – Foster Family (licensed)\n Court Orders\n- Hearing date: 8/17/2021 court ordered Youth A remain in the care and\nsupervision of the department. Referee signed 8/17/2021, Judge signed\n8/19/2021.\n- Hearing date: 11/8/2021 court ordered Youth A remain in the care and\nsupervision of the department. The order also included the following\nnarrative, “The minor child may be returned to the home of the father on\nan Order as Prayed with Intensive Home-Based services and written GAL\napproval.” Referee signed 11/8/2021, Judge signed 11/9/2021.\n- Hearing date: 3/1/2022 court ordered Youth A remain in the care and\nsupervision of the department. Referee signed 3/1/2022, Judge signed\n3/2/2022.\n Social Work Contacts with Parent A post replacement\n3",
    "- 1/13/2022 Foster Care Worker home visit with Parent A & Youth A, worker\nreviewed safety plan and conducted FTM with Parent A.\n- 1/20/2022 Foster Care Worker home visit with Parent A & Youth A, Parent\nadmitted to violating safety plan by having Youth A’s mother at the home.\n- 2/2/2022 Phone call between Parent A and Foster Care Worker, Parent A\nadmitted drug relapse.\nWhile reviewing social work contacts, it was noted that a conference had been held\nregarding an allegation received by DHHS. I reviewed the allegation dated\n1/21/2022 which stated Parent A may be using methamphetamines while Youth A is\nin his care and also allowing Youth A’s mother, who is not to have any contact with\nYouth A, into Parent A’s home regularly.\nAdditionally, it was noted that the discussions Foster Care Worker reported having\nwith the court about the placement were not documented in MiSACWIS.\nOn 4/4/2022 I reviewed the Foster Family’s case record in MiSACWIS which\ndocumented the following:\n- License closed voluntarily on 1/23/2022\n- License re-opened 2/4/2022\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12404 Placement.\n(1) An agency shall only place a child with an adult who\nis legally related to the child, is a legal custodian, or\nin a licensed foster home, except as permitted in R\n400.12709.\nANALYSIS: Foster Care Worker placed Youth A in the home of Parent A\ndespite not having legal authority to make the placement. Youth\nA was placed in Parent A’s home for 19 days during which\nParent A admitted to violating an established safety plan and\ndrug use. Foster Care Worker removed Youth A from Parent A\nand placed Youth A with an unlicensed foster family. Youth A\nremained in an unlicensed placement for 9 days until the foster\nhome was relicensed.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4",
