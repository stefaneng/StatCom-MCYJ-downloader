Upon arriving at the facility DHHS Worker 1 was not able\nto enter the lobby because there was a group of youth that were\nlocated there and refusing to leave, so staff had not allowed this\nentrance to be used from the outside. DHHS Worker 1 was\ngreeted by a staff member that she could not recall and brought in\nanother entrance to the facility. She recalled this staff did not ask\nwho DHHS Worker 1 was. DHHS Worker 1 remarked she\nidentified herself unprompted and was also wearing her employee\nidentification card in view of others. DHHS Worker 1 then met\nwith Youth A. She stated this occurred in a lounge type room that\nalso was used as a pass through area from the front area of the\nfacility to further inside. Upon finishing her conversation with\nYouth A, there was no staff available to help transport him back to\nhis unit. DHHS Worker 1 stated she followed Youth A back to the\nfront area of the building through one doorway and Youth A was\nmet by a staff member that she could not recall who took\nsupervision of him.\n2",
    "Staff 1 was interviewed on 09/11/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit at the facility. Staff 1 reported she worked as a\nreceptionist and office manager and often greeted outside visitors\nto the facility. She described a general procedure for the facility\nand visitors as having them sign in and provide identification.\nStaff 1 noted there are occasions when visitors come and they\ndon’t have the identification that allows the facility to ensure they\nknow who and why they are there, and those visitors are sent\naway to come back with valid identification. Staff 1 was able to\nprovide the sign in log for the date in question (09/09/2024).\nYouth A was interviewed on 09/11/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit at the facility. Regarding the process for\nspeaking to visitors, Youth A stated he is always brought to one of\nthe rooms in the front of the facility by a staff member and then\nbrought back to wherever he needed to be by a staff member.\nThey are not always the same staff and sometimes it takes a\nmoment for them to be found, but Youth A stated he has never\nbeen left alone after speaking to a visitor. Youth A recalled\nmeeting with DHHS Worker 1 the previous week but could not\nrecall which staff brought him to her and then escorted him back.\nYouth A stated staff stick to their line of sight supervision within\nthe building and he stated he is never alone other than sleeping or\nusing the bathroom and showering.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone on 09/17/2024. She\nrecalled the instance when DHHS Worker 1 visited the facility to\nspeak with Youth A. Because of the issue at the time of other\nyouth being in the lobby and not listening to staff directives, Staff 2\nlet DHHS Worker 1 into the building. She recalled seeing the\nidentification card DHHS Worker 1 was wearing and provided\nthem with the normal sign in sheet. Staff 2 stated another staff\ntook over escorting DHHS Worker 1 to speak with Youth A at that\ntime.\nYouth A’s Probation Officer was interviewed over the phone on\n09/17/2024. She stated she has visited the facility several times\nduring Youth A’s placement and never had concerns over security\nregarding visitors or supervision of Youth A.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Facility documentation for visitor registration covering the\nmonth of September 2024 was provided and reviewed.\nDated 09/09/2024 a sign in from DHHS Worker 1 is\ndocumented.\n3",
    "• Case documentation from DHHS Worker 1 dated\n09/09/2024 was reviewed and it was noted that “State of\nMichigan work Identification was presented to staff, and\nthey allowed access into the facility through a different\ndoor.” It was also noted Youth A became upset at the end\nof the conversation with DHHS Worker 1 and “walked off\ninto the lobby area” without noting which staff was next\ninteracted with.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per interviews of youth and\nstaff and documentation reviewed. There was no evidence that\nthe safety, supervision and protection of youth were not\nsufficiently provided regarding security of outside visitors or\ngeneral supervision of youth.\nConsultation provided:\n• The facility is advised to write a policy regarding visitors,\nsecurity and sign-in procedures.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/13/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/31/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4"
