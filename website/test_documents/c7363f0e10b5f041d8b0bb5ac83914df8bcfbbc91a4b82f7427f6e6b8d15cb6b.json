    "ALLEGATION: Youth A and Youth B were watching a movie on 1/29/22.\nYouth B touched Youth A in the genitals under his underwear. The children\nwere under a blanket together. A safety plan was put into place.\nINVESTIGATION:\nWhaley Children’s Center is a open residential program serving males and females, age\nrange 5-17 who are permanent or temporary court wards.\nOn 2/16/22, I spoke to Administrator 1. Allegations and scheduling was discussed as\nwell as documentation needed for the investigation.\nI reviewed the following documents throughout the course of the investigation:\n Face sheets\n Incident reports (14)\n Sexual Safety Plan\n Whaley’s Staff Shadow Workbook\n Team Meeting Agenda (2)\n Individual Supervision Form\n Child Supervision Policy\n Respite policy\nVideo observation was available.\nAll interviews were conducted face to face at the facility.\nIt is to be noted that Youth B is not a resident of this facility. The agency moved him\nfrom license number CI250309991 and placed him into Mott’s Children Residence. This\nplacement was made on 1/28/22 and Youth B remained at the facility until 1/31/22.\nI reviewed seven incident reports pertaining to Youth B.\n10/24/20: Youth B had kissed staff’s hand and told her “I just love you”\n11/6/20: Youth B grabbed staff’s hand and kissed it. He told staff “I love you” and then\nhugged the staff.\n11/6/20: (15 minutes after the previous incident report): Youth B rubbed his feet up\nagainst a staff’s foot.\n2/11/21 (2): (Incident 1) Youth B was in the shower naked, and another female peer\nwas in the shower as well with her clothes on.

A licensing investigation was\ncompleted for this incident. Special Investigation Number:\n2/13/22: Youth B attempted to go into another peer’s bedroom\n2/14/22: Youth B was upset that Youth A was telling everyone that he (Youth B)\ntouched Youth A\n3",
    "2/13/22: Youth A reported he was “scared” due to Youth B “was touching my wiener and\nwanted me to have sex with him”. Youth A reported that the staff watching them was\nasleep.\n2/14/22: Youth A reported to staff that Youth B touched his genitals under a blanket\nwhile they were watching a movie. 3200 filed and initial safety plan in effect for youth to\nnot have any contact.\nI reviewed the Sexual Safety Plan for Youth B. Youth B had an original safety plan on\n12/22/20 and an updated one was completed on 2/16/22. The original and updated\nsafety plan discussed the past history of Youth B and documented precautions that staff\nare to take. Some precautions pertinent to this investigation are:\n Staff must have visual contact with Youth B when interacting with peers at all\ntimes\n Staff must ensure that Youth B respects the personal boundaries of others\nincluding staff and peers\n Youth B must be seated next to a staff or in visual range of staff at all times\n Staff must ensure they are able to see Youth B’s hands at all times when he is\nseated.\n Youth B will not be sitting within arms reach of any other youth and must sit in his\nown seat including when sitting at a dinner table, watching tv, in vehicles, etc.\n Youth B will not be allowed to share any blankets with other youth and will not be\nallowed access to blankets outside of his bedroom\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Youth C. Youth C reported he was watching the movie Godzilla with Youth\nA and Youth B with Staff 1. Youth C reported that Youth B is normally in a different\nfacility but has been at their facility before. Youth C reported that Youth B came to their\nfacility because another youth was targeting him. Youth C reported that Youth A and\nYouth B sat next to each other on the couch and shared a blanket. Youth C reported the\nblanket was across their lap. Youth C reported that the lights were on during the movie.\nYouth C reported he did not know whether Youth A and Youth B were touching each\nother.\nI interviewed Youth A. Youth A reported they were watching the movie, Shazam with\nYouth B and Youth C, and Staff 1. Youth A reported that Youth B is not normally in their\nunit. Youth A reported that Youth C got into a fight and so he was allowed to spend the\nnight at their unit. Youth A reported that Youth C was sitting on the corner with Staff 1\nand Youth A was sitting with Youth B. Youth A reported the lights were turned off and\nthey had blankets out for the movie. Youth A reported that Youth B had his blanket out\nand Youth A reported he put Youth B’s blanket on his lap. Youth A reported the blanket\nwas over both his lap and Youth B’s lap. Youth A reported that Staff 1 was sleeping.\nYouth A reported he knew this because Youth A was snoring. Youth A reported that\nYouth B touched his penis under his underwear. Youth A reported Youth B was\nsqueezing his penis as well. Youth A reported Youth B touched his (Youth A’s) butt\n4",
    "under his clothing as well. Youth A reported he did not say anything to Youth B or to\nstaff. Youth A reported he did not tell Youth B to stop touching him. Youth A reported\nthat Youth B has never touched him before in this manner. Youth A reported he has\nonly received hugs from Youth B. Youth A reported that Youth B asked him to come into\nhis (Youth B’s) room on 2/13/22.\nI interviewed Youth B. Youth B reported he was watching the movie Shazam with Youth\nA, Youth C, and Staff 1. Youth B reported that during the movie the lights were out and\nthey were allowed to have their blankets. Youth B reported he shared a blanket with\nYouth A.

Youth B reported that Youth A kept\nsaying, “I’m going to touch you if you don’t let me use your MPs player”. Youth B\nreported that staff wasn’t asleep but he kept scrolling through his phone throughout the\nmovie. Youth B reported he did not touch Youth A.\nI interviewed Staff 1. Staff 1 was hired on 12/6/21 and transferred to this unit on 1/30/22.\nStaff 1 reported he was not initially in this unit during the beginning of his shift on\n1/29/22 but was rotated into it. Staff 1 reported that Youth B was not a part of the unit\nbut came to the unit during his shift. Staff 1 reported that no one talked to him about the\nprecautions he needed to take with Youth B. Staff 1 reported when first hired, he had to\nread through all the children’s files to become familiar with them. Staff 1 reported he\nwas not aware that other youth could not sit next to him. Staff 1 reported that no one\never gave him a safety plan for Youth B. Staff1 reported that the children had blankets\nbut there is no policy on blankets. Staff 1 reported that both Youth A and Youth C had\nblankets. Staff 1 reported that the lights were off until another staff came in and told him\nhe couldn’t have the lights off. Staff 1 reported he did use his phone to look up email\nand did report that he might have closed his eyes but did not fall asleep. Staff 1 reported\nthat he was not interested in the movie, so he wasn’t paying attention. Staff 1 reported\nhe did have his hoodie on and so it may have looked like he was sleeping. Staff 1\nreported that he was not paying attention to them as he should have been.\nI reviewed the Children’s Supervision Policy:\n…Staff must remain awake and alert at all times when on duty…staff cannot lie down,\nbe in a reclined position…immobile for more than 15 consecutive minutes…LIGHTING:\nlights are to be kept on while in any environment…this includes while watching\ntelevision…Personal cell phones are not permitted on the floor and cannot be used by\nstaff in ratio during working hours…\nI interviewed Administrator 2. Administrator 2 reported that half of the youth have safety\nplans in their files. Administrator 2 reported that all staff are to read safety plans weekly\nand sign a document stating they have done so. Administrator 2 reported the supervisor\nwould ensure that the staff are signing off on these. Administrator 2 reported even if\nYouth B is in another facility, all staff have access to all youth’s files in both facilities.\nAdministrator 1 reported that after Staff 1 was hired he completed training and then had\n5",
    "one mandatory team meetings that he would have been in where he would have\ndiscussed the children in the unit and any other needs or treatment interventions for the\nchildren. Administrator 1 reported Staff 1 did attend. Administrator 1 reported that Staff\n1 would have been well aware of the safety plans for Youth B and should have known\nthe policy on child supervision concerning blankets, lights, cell phones, and sleeping.\nAdministrator 2 provided the following documents:\n Acknowledgement Receipt for New Hire Paperwork\n Individual Supervision Form\n Team Meeting Agenda\n Staff Shadow Workbook\nStaff 1 signed off on the Acknowledgement Receipt for New Hire Paperwork stating\nhe reviewed the Child Supervision Policy on 12/6/21.\nI reviewed the Individual Supervision Form dated 1/4/22. This form was a welcome\nform for Staff 1 to the unit. It was to inform Staff 1 of the duties of his job.\nUnder the subheading “Tasks to be Completed”, it was Staff 1’s task to “read and\nsign off on the Population Booklet weekly…and to attend Mandatory Monthly Team\nMeetings.\nI reviewed the Team Meeting Agenda dated 2/11/22. This would have been the first\nteam meeting that Staff 1 went to in his new unit. Team Meeting Agenda discussed\nconsistency in routines and structure no matter what staff is supervising youth.\nI reviewed the Staff Shadow Workbook that Staff 1 signed on 12/17/21. Staff 1\ncompleted this during his initial training at the facility. On page 2 of the handbook,\nquestion 2 asks: “Name a child residing on a unit/group home on which you shadowed\nthat has a sexual safety plan.” Staff 1 named Youth B. Question 3 asks: “List 3 things\nmentioned within the sexual safety plan pertaining to that specific child:” Staff 3 reported\nYouth B’s history of perpetuating sexual abuse on family members.\nI asked to review the weekly sign off sheets pertaining to staff reviewing the weekly\nPopulation Booklets, which contain the Sexual Safety Plan. This was destroyed by one\nof the youth so these were not available for review.\nI observed the video footage for the incident. The lights were off during the movie. Staff\n1 and Youth C were on one side of the couch and Youth A and Youth B were right next\nto each other sharing a blanket. Youth A was on the left of Youth B. Youth A had his\nhands under the blanket and there was movement on and near Youth B’s lap area\nunder the blanket. At one point Youth A pushed back the blanket covering them up and\nplaced his head over top Youth B’s genital area.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both the\nfollowing:\n(a) ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 was given the Child Supervision Policy and A Sexual\nSafety Plan that specifically laid out staff interventions that were\nto be used with Youth B. Although he had these tools, he was\nunable to perform the duties assigned to him.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS Staff 1 was provided with the Sexual Safety Plan for Youth B,\nwhich expressed:\n Staff must have visual contact with Youth B when\ninteracting with peers at all times\n Staff must ensure that Youth B respects the personal\nboundaries of others including staff and peers\n Youth B must be seated next to a staff or in visual range\nof staff at all times\n Staff must ensure they are able to see Youth B’s hands\nat all times when he is seated.\n Youth B will not be sitting within arms reach of any other\nyouth and must sit in his own seat including when sitting\nat a dinner table, watching tv, in vehicles, etc.\n Youth B will not be allowed to share any blankets with\nother youth and will not be allowed access to blankets\noutside of his bedroom\nStaff 1 signed off that he had read the Child Supervision Policy.\nAlthough Staff 1 had knowledge of Youth B’s Sexual Safety Plan\nand the supervision policy he failed to perform his duty of\nproviding for the continual supervision and protection of the\nyouth.\n7",
    "CONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS: Youth B is not placed at Mott’s Children\nResidence, license number CI250201313. Youth B was removed from\nhis legal placement at license number CI250309991 and placed in\nMott’s Children Residence by the agency. The agency called this\n“respite”.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A reported that Youth B is not normally in their unit. Youth A reported that Youth\nC got into a fight and so he was allowed to spend the night at their unit. Youth A\nreported that Youth B asked him to come into his (Youth B’s) room on 2/13/22.\nYouth B reported that he has stayed at this facility before and specifically during the\nmovie Shazam, he stayed the weekend. Youth B reported that Youth A has been over\nat his placement and made allegation that he (Youth B) had asked him (Youth A) to\ncome into his room.\nYouth C reported that Youth B is normally in a different facility but has been at their\nfacility before. Youth C reported that Youth B came to their facility because another\nyouth was targeting him.\nAdministrator 1 reported Youth B is normally at license number CI250309991 but due to\nhis behaviors he was placed into Mott’s Children Residence for “respite”.\nAdministrator 3 reported that Youth B was placed into Mott’s Children Residence on\n1/28/22 and he stayed at the facility until 1/31/22. Administrator 3 reported they have\nbeen moving children back and forth, between license for at least 5 years. Administrator\n3 reported they even have a Respite Policy. Administrator 3 reported the DHS 3600\ndoes not specify Youth B’s placement as Mott’s Children Residence.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4152 Initial documentation.\nAt the time of admission, all of the following shall be in the\nresident's\ncase record:\n(f) Documentation of legal right to provide care.\n8",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency did not have the legal right to provide care to Youth\nB. They referred to Youth B moving from one agency to the\nother as “respite”. “Respite”, as the agency describes it, is when\na child moves from one of their licensed facilities to another for\neither:\n Safety reasons (youth is a target or is targeting other\npeers)\n Lack of staffing\n Maltreatment in Care investigations (safety planning)\nThe agency was under the impression that they could move\nchildren between licenses as long as the youth’s worker\napproved this move. The agency administration reported this\nchange in placement occurs fluidly.\nYouth B should not have been placed into the facility because\nhis legal placement is at license number CI250309991.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nThe recommendation is to continue the current license status.\n4/5/22\n________________________________________\nVenus M.
