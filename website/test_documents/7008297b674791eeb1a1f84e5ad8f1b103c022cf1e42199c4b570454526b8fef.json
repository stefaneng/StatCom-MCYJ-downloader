    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Privacy safeguard\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12211\nSection (1) An agency shall safeguard the privacy of a child and his or her\nDescription family.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Worker is no longer assigned to case but has had contact and\nshared case information with the foster parent and birth parent.\nInvestigation On 4/23/25 anonymous Complainant reported some concerns\nregarding a DHHS Worker for Youth A’s foster care case.\nComplainant indicated the case moved from the former worker,\nDHHS Worker to a private agency on 3/31/25. However, DHHS\nWorker continued to have contact with Foster Parent 1, Foster\nParent 2 and Parent. Complainant stated there was recently a\nspecial evaluation conducted on the foster home. When the\nallegation came in, DHHS Worker contacted Foster Parent 1 and\nasked, “What’s going on?” DHHS Worker also continued contact\nwith Parent, despite rights being terminated. DHHS Worker\ncontacted Parent because Parent posted a photo of Youth A on\nher Facebook page. During that conversation, DHHS Worker gave\nParent information about Youth A’s respite placement. This\nprompted Parent to reach out to Youth A online and attempt to\nspeak with her. It was reported DHHS Worker also told Parent\nwhat city Youth A was residing in with the foster parents.\nComplainant was contacted by phone on 4/24/25 and declined an\ninterview. However, they were able to send screen shots of\nFacebook and text communications referenced in the allegations.\nComplainant was informed the investigation would focus on the\nthree main concerns as they related to licensing rules: DHHS\nWorker contact foster parent about investigation, DHHS Worker\ncontact with Parent about Youth A being in respite, and DHHS\nWorker informed Parent of location of Youth A’s foster home.\nInterviews:\nDHHS Worker was interviewed via video call on Teams on\n4/30/25. DHHS Worker reported being assigned to Youth A’s case\nfor approximately two years, before it moved to another agency on\n3/31/25. Youth A became an MCI ward on 2/27/25 and the case\nmoved to a private agency to complete the adoption process.\nDHHS Worker recalled Foster Care Worker reached out to her on\n2",
    "4/10/25 or 4/11/25 while they were completing a home visit and\nstated Youth A reported she did not feel loved by the foster\nparents and made some allegations about them making her feel\nuncomfortable. DHHS Worker told Foster Care Worker that she\nhad never heard statements like that from Youth A before and was\nsurprised by the allegations. DHHS Worker stated she did not\ndiscuss the allegations with Foster Parent 1 or Foster Parent 2.\nHowever, Foster Parent 1 reached out to DHHS Worker and\nstated she did not know what to do about Youth A’s lying, and the\nsituation was affecting Foster Parent 1’s health, indicating they\nwere not sure if they would continue the plan to adopt. DHHS\nWorker decided to speak with Youth A, as she had worked with\nthe youth for about two years and wanted to know she was safe.\nDHHS Worker also wanted to try to help preserve the placement\nand have an honest conversation with Youth A about her ongoing\nbehavior. DHHS Worker indicated she did not think Youth A would\nopen up to the new worker, as the case had only transferred about\nten days prior. Youth A told DHHS Worker she made up the\nallegations as she was frustrated about being grounded. DHHS\nWorker encouraged Youth A to be honest with her new worker\nand talk about the situation. DHHS Worker also told the foster\nparents Youth A was feeling frustrated and encouraged\nconversation. DHHS Worker stated she never discussed the\nallegations with the foster parents as she knew it was not her job\nto investigate.\nOn 4/10/25 Foster Parent 2 contacted DHHS Worker via text to\nask about setting up respite. DHHS Worker replied to Foster\nParent 2 that Foster Care Worker would need to arrange respite.\nDHHS Worker did not know any details about when the respite\noccurred, where, or for how long. DHHS Worker denied telling\nParent anything about respite. However, DHHS Worker reported\nshe had some contact with Parent around that time. On 4/12/25\nFoster Parent 2 texted DHHS Worker that Parent had posted an\nupdated photo of Youth A on Facebook, and they were unsure\nhow Parent got the photo. On 4/12/25 Foster Parent 1 texted\nDHHS Worker that Parent continued trying to call Youth A through\nFacebook Messenger. This was a situation that had been\noccurring prior to case transfer and Foster Parent 1 was letting\nDHHS Worker know that it was continuing. DHHS Worker called\nParent and let her know that she was aware of the attempted\ncalls, and that it was inappropriate as rights were terminated and\nthere was a no-contact order. During the call DHHS Worker tried\nto dissuade Parent from calling again, by stating Youth A was not\nat the house that weekend anyway and could not be reached.\nDHHS Worker believed this may be why Parent mentioned respite\n3",
    "in one of her Facebook messages to Youth A. DHHS Worker\nstated she did not say anything about where Youth A was, or why\nshe was not at the foster home. DHHS Worker told Parent that\nshe was no longer involved in the case and did not have any\ninformation, nor could she share it anyway. On 4/12/25 DHHS\nWorker agreed with Foster Parent 1 via text that the new worker,\nFoster Care Worker, should be notified of Parent’s continued\nattempts to contact Youth A.\nRegarding the foster parent’s location, DHHS Worker stated she\nnever gave Parent information about the location of the foster\nhome. However, when DHHS Worker had the case, Parent knew\nwhat school Youth A was attending, as this was a known fact\nwhen the case was in reunification. Therefore, it seemed logical\nthat Parent knew what city Youth A was residing in with the foster\nparents. In addition, as this is a relative placement in the same\ncommunity as other family members, it is possible other family\nmembers may have shared the information as well. DHHS Worker\nstated there were definitely some communication issues at the\nbeginning when the case transferred. DHHS Worker did her best\nto refer foster parents back to Foster Care Worker. However,\nParent never had contact with Foster Care Worker, as her rights\nhad already been terminated when the case transferred. DHHS\nWorker believed she could get through to Parent about ceasing\nthe Facebook contact, based on the fact she worked with her for\nso long, and the no-contact order occurred while she had the\ncase. DHHS Worker stated she had no intention of interfering with\nthe case or being involved after the case transferred.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via video call on\nTeams, on 5/13/25. FCW was informed of the allegations. FCW\nconfirmed Foster Parent 1 is the paternal aunt of Youth A. Foster\nParent 1 told FCW that she was frustrated DHHS Worker gave\nParent information about them. Foster Parent 1 stated that DHHS\nWorker had contact with Parent to tell her not to contact Youth A.\nFoster Parent 1 believed DHHS Worker must have shared\ninformation with Parent at that time about where they live and\nYouth A going to respite. FCW never addressed these concerns\nwith DHHS Worker. FCW stated she never spoke with Parent\nabout contacting Youth A on Facebook. FCW received the case\nafter parental rights were terminated, therefore she never\nestablished contact with Parent. Regarding Youth A going to\nrespite, FCW reported DHHS Worker may have become aware of\nthe respite placement during a case conference, as respite\noccurred the next day. FCW did not believe Foster Parent 1\nshared any information about respite with DHHS Worker. Foster\n4",
    "Parent 1 indicated that messages on Facebook made her believe\nthat DHHS Worker told Parent about respite.\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 were interviewed jointly by\nphone on 5/29/25. The foster parents reported they were relative\ncaregivers for Youth A. Foster Parent 1 stated, with Foster Parent\n2’s agreement, that they really liked DHHS Worker and thought\nshe did a great job with the case. They did not feel she was too\ninvolved with anything. It was just recently that they found\nFacebook messages from Parent, indicating that DHHS Worker\ntold her what city they lived in, and that Youth A was at a respite\nplacement for a weekend in April. The foster parents did not have\nany indication that DHHS Worker told Parent where the respite\nplacement was. However, the foster parents were concerned that\nif Parent knew where they lived, she would show up at their\nhouse, which would be traumatizing to Youth A. Foster Parent 1\nstated Parent’s mother lived only five minutes away from them.\nTherefore, it was a very real concern that Parent would find their\nhome or run into them in public.\nFoster Parent 1 stated Parent had attempted to contact Youth A\non Facebook before and after case transfer. After the case\ntransferred, the foster parents noticed some messenger activity on\nYouth A’s Facebook account. They saw Youth A had contact with\nParent. Foster Parent 1 stated they did not know the new case\nworker (Foster Care Worker) yet, as the case had just transferred,\nso Foster Parent 1 reached out to DHHS Worker to let her know\nthat Parent had posted a newer photo of Youth A on her\nFacebook page. DHHS Worker then reached out to Parent, to let\nher know she could not contact Youth A. Foster Parent 1 stated\nshe was upset that Parent knew what city they lived in and what\nschool Youth A attended. The school was aware of rights being\nterminated and reported to Foster Parent 1 that Parent had tried to\ncontact the school to get information about Youth A.\nRegarding DHHS Worker discussing an investigation with the\nfoster parents, both foster parents stated they never had a special\nevaluation or discussed allegations with anyone. Foster Parent 1\nstated that she had contact with DHHS Worker when she was\nfrustrated with Youth A’s behavior. DHHS Worker spoke with\nYouth A to try to help with their concerns. This occurred as the\ncase was transitioning to the new agency and Foster Parent 1 felt\nmore comfortable speaking with DHHS Worker as she had not\nmet Foster Care Worker yet.\n5",
    "DHHS Supervisor was interviewed via video call on Teams on\n5/30/25. Supervisor confirmed he supervised DHHS Worker for\nthe past year, while she had Youth A’s case. The case then\ntransferred to another agency on 3/31/25, to complete the\nadoption with Youth A’s relative caregiver. Supervisor reported\nDHHS Worker was very good at her job and there were no\nconcerns. DHHS Worker did not have an overly friendly, or close\nrelationship with Parent. Parent had significant mental health and\nsubstance abuse concerns, which made the case very\nchallenging, but DHHS Worker worked well with her.\nRegarding the allegations, Supervisor indicated he had no reason\nto believe DHHS Worker shared any information with Parent about\nthe location of the foster home or respite placement. Parent was\naware of the school Youth A attended as that information was not\nprotected when the case was in reunification. Supervisor noted\nthat having relative caregivers can be difficult as family members\nshare information, especially when they live in the same\ncommunity. Supervisor had no knowledge of DHHS Worker\ndiscussing the respite placement with Parent. Supervisor also had\nno knowledge of DHHS Worker discussing a special evaluation\nwith the foster parents after the case transferred.\nOverall, Supervisor stated that DHHS Worker was a great worker\nwho always did the right thing in his experience. He would be\nsurprised by any slip-ups, but understands we are all human and\nthis may be a coachable moment if a problem is found.\nAttempts were made to interview Parent on 6/2/25 and 6/9/25.\nHowever, there was no response.\nDocuments Review:\n• Record for Foster Parent 1 & Foster Parent 2- Unlicensed\nrelative caregiver for Youth A since 4/2/24. No special\nevaluations, as they were not licensed. The family lived at\nthe current address prior to accepting placement of Youth\nA.\n• Youth A’s case record: MCI ward 2/27/25. TDM occurred\n3/14/25 for case transfer. Case transfer effective 3/31/25.\n• 3/29/25 text from Foster Parent 1 to DHHS Worker: “Good\nMorning! So I don’t know who to contact with this info.\n(Parent) called (Youth A) again yesterday. It was a missed\ncall thank goodness. I saw it late last night.”\n• 3/29/25 text from DHHS Worker to Foster Parent 1: “I think\nwe need to let the court know. Let me see if there is a\nmotion for noncompliance that can be started. I told\n6",
    "(Parent) last week that any contact is contempt of court and\nshe can be charged. Or we could just call the police and file\ncharges”.\n• 3/29/25 text from Foster Parent 1 to DHHS Worker: “Can\nwe do both or is one as good as the other?”\n• 3/30/25 text from DHHS Worker to Foster Parent 1: “Sorry,\nI didn’t answer this. Let me see if I can find out which route\nwe should take.”\n• 3/30/25 text from Foster Parent 1 to DHHS Worker:\n“Attached screen shot of FB missed call and message from\n(Parent).”\no Screenshot- 3/29/25 11:00 am message from Parent\nto Foster Parent 1 “Hiiii”\no Screenshot- 3/29/25 9:41pm message from Foster\nParent 1 to Parent: “you need to stop with the\ncontact. You are prohibited from having any contact\nwith (Youth A) and you and I are not friends. I will\nnot be communicating with you at all. Let (Youth A)\nhave a chance at a good, normal life for a change.\nYou should be concentrating on getting yourself\ntogether. Leave us alone!”\n• Facebook Messenger messages:\no 4/8/25 from Parent to Youth A: “(DHHS Worker) told\nme that (Foster Parent 1) had to get a place in\nHudsonville… Is that where you are?” Youth A\nresponded “yeah”. Parent said, “call me quick”.\no 4/11/25 three attempted calls from Parent to Youth\nA. Then a message, “Hi my sweet (Youth A) I hope\nyou’re OK. I don’t know if this will get to you but I\nkinda heard a bit of what happened and that you’re\nnot there right now. If you need me I’m here…”\n• 4/10/25 text from Foster Parent 2 to DHHS Worker: “Good\nmorning. Are you still who we contact if we need to request\na respite weekend?”\n• 4/10/25 text from DHHS Worker to Foster Parent 2: “Has\nthe new worker been in touch with you? You’d ask her now”\n• 4/12/25 text from Foster Parent 1 to DHHS Worker: “She\n(Parent) just called again”. “Now that I think about it, the\nbigger problems began with us finding out (Youth A)\ncontacted (Parent).”\n• 4/12/25 text from DHHS Worker to Foster Parent 1: “I\ncalled (Parent) regarding the new picture I found on her FB\npage of (Youth A). She said it was an old one. I asked\n(Parent) if (Youth A) had contacted her and she said no. All\nI told her was (Youth A) was at another house for the\n7",
    "weekend and nothing more. (Parent) really needs to stop\nthe contact. I’m so sorry all of this is happening.”\n• 4/12/25 text from Foste Parent 1 to DHHS Worker: “Do I\ntalk to (Foster Care Worker) about all of this then? I’m not\nsure how much further I can take all of this. Like I said it’s\nstarting to affect my heath in a negative way.”\nAnalysis No violation was found. Based on interviews with the current and\nformer caseworker and foster parents, it did not appear DHHS\nWorker was openly sharing case information. Parent was aware of\nthe community the youth lived in, due to education information that\nwas available while the case was in reunification. In addition, it\nappeared DHHS Worker made a generalized statement about the\nyouth not being home, and there was no indication they provided\ndetailed information about the respite. Lastly, there was no\nindication DHHS Worker was inappropriately involved in an\ninvestigation as there was not a special evaluation on the foster\nhome.\nCONSULTATION:\nBased on interviews, the foster parents’ initiated contact with\nDHHS Worker for a few days after the case transfer date. DHHS\nWorker redirected the foster parents but also tried to provide\nsupport by talking with Foster Parent 1 and Youth A. DHHS\nWorker also reached out to Parent to remind them of a court order\nthat occurred while she had the case. While DHHS Worker\nappeared to be well intentioned, best practice would be to redirect\nany case participants to the assigned worker and contact the new\nagency to discuss any issues or develop a plan which may or may\nnot include assistance from the former worker.\nIn addition, the agency was advised that a case conference may\nbe beneficial to define roles and provide contact information to\nfoster parents before a case transfers.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n8",
