There\nwas documentation of debriefing with the youth and efforts to avoid the restraint. Six\nseclusion reports were reviewed and again, the staff followed the facility\npolicy/procedures when youth were placed in their rooms. There was documentation\nof room checks being completed as required to ensure the safety of the youth.\nInterviews were conducted with staff and youth at the facility. All of the youth report\nfeeling safe and well cared for.
