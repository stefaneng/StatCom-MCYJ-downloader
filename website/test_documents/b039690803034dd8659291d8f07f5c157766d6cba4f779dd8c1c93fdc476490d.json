    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency placed a youth in foster home certified by another agency\nwithout notifying the agency. Placement of the youth put the home\nover the approved capacity and there is no borrowed bed\nagreement in place.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on February 28,\n2025. They reported no additional information.\nFoster Parent (FP) was interviewed via telephone on February\n28, 2025. FP stated the situation was very confusing. Guiding\nHarbor had informed her she was originally licensed for 2 youth\nhowever, an addendum was in process to increase her licensing\ncapacity to 4. She was under the impression the addendum had\nbeen completed but the agency later told her it hadn’t been\ncompleted. At one point she had Youth A and her baby and the\nagency placed another youth. The other youth went AWOL shortly\nafter being placed in her home and Guiding Harbor contacted her\nabout taking another youth and her baby. FP told them no\nbecause she was probably going to be taking Youth B who is\nYouth A’s sister.\nFP stated Youth B was placed through Whaley and MDHHS. She\nclarified she communicated with Whaley regarding placement of\nYouth B prior to her being placed in her home. FP stated there\nhad been ongoing conversations regarding potential placement of\nYouth B for some time. She stated MDHHS FC supervisor had\nadvised they needed to slow down to ensure the placement was\ndone properly and everything was in order because Whaley was\ntrying to push it through quickly.\nPAFC Foster Care Program Manager (PAFC FC PM) was\ninterviewed via telephone on February 28, 2025. She stated the\nagency became aware on February 24, 2025, that Youth B had\nbeen placed with FP. She stated Youth B has been in the\nplacement since January 24, 2025. She stated FP and MDHHS\nreported Whaley had reached out to FP regarding placement of\nYouth B. Youth B was in Whaley at the time and had done sibling\nvisits with Youth A in FP’s home. She stated a referral had been\nmade to RPU to assist in locating a placement for Youth B. During\na recent meeting with MDHHS someone reported prior to Youth B\nbeing placed they were trying to get Whaley to slow down\nbecause things were moving too fast and needed to ensure things\nwere in place if Youth B was to be placed in FP’s home. She could\nnot recall who made those comments. PAFC FC PM stated the\n2",
    "agency was never notified by anyone that placement was being\nconsidered in FP’s home.\nMDHHS Foster Care supervisor (MDHHS FC supervisor) was\ninterviewed via video conference on March 4, 2025. She stated\nher agency had been looking for a placement for Youth B for a\nlong time. RPU as well as Wayne Co. placement unit has been\nlooped in the placement search. RPU sent an email saying they\nhad been informed about a placement with FP who also has\nplacement of her sister, Youth A so they are going to close out\ntheir referral. MDHHS FC supervisor immediately responded and\ninformed RPU they hadn’t initiated any placement with FP and\nthere had not been any communication between FP and MDHHS\ndirectly indicating this was a placement they were looking into.\nShe asked if they could give her time to look into everything and\nthen go from there. RPU responded and indicated Whaley\nreported Youth B had been visiting in the home on the weekends,\nso they went ahead and closed out their referral. MDHHS FC\nsupervisor again asked them not to close the referral and they\nhave not had any communication regarding DOC or anything and\nall of the communication up until that point was with Whaley. RPU\nwas adamant they would close out the referral and they didn’t\nhave additional communication beyond that. She contacted FP\nand asked where she received information regarding possible\nplacement. FP reported she had been in communication with\nWhaley and they had negotiated a specific DOC rate for Youth B.\nMDHHS FC supervisor asked MDHHS FCW to schedule a\nplacement change TDM and invite everyone so there could be\ndiscussion on what needed to be done on their end for Youth B to\nbe placed with FP. She stated she was trying to include anyone\nshe could think of to assist but she didn’t include their licensing\nstaff because at that point she was trying to have everyone\ninvolved to stop and allow her time to review the case and see\nwhat was going on and what needed to be done. MDHHS FC\nsupervisor stated after the TDM the placement change moved\nforward and MDHHS staff transported Youth B to the FP’s home.\nFP reported during the TDM she thought she had room for 2 youth\nand had declined placement for another youth so she could\naccept Youth B. FP reported she spoke to Guiding Harbor about\ntaking placement of Youth B. FC supervisor thought she had\ninvited all of the appropriate people to the TDM in order to move\nforward.\nMDHHS FC supervisor clarified RPU had been involved since\nSeptember or October 2024. They contacted MDHHS FC\n3",
    "supervisor directly in January and said placement had been found\nfor Youth B so they were going to close their referral. She thought\nit was strange they didn’t give her a chance to sort things out\nbefore abruptly closing the referral. MDHHS thought since FP is\nlicensed and everyone was aware of the plan and Youth B had a\ndischarge date they moved her. FP had reported she was in\ncontact with Guiding Harbor about Youth B because both\nagencies were making attempts to obtain a bed for her.\nMDHHS Foster Care worker (MDHHS FCW) was interviewed\nvia telephone on March 7, 2025. She stated there was\ncommunication between RPU and Wayne Co Placement Unit\nregarding placement of Youth B. There were some visits at FP’s\nhome between Youth A and Youth B so FP was familiar with\nYouth B. FP had stated she was willing to take placement of\nYouth B and indicated she had communicated that with Guiding\nHarbor.\nMDHHS FCW stated RPU abruptly closed out their referral and\nMDHHS FC supervisor had asked them to slow the process down\nto make sure everything was appropriate. At that point, Youth B\nwas placed with FP. MDHHS FCW stated she picked up Youth B\nfrom Whaley and transported her to FP’s house. MDHHS FCW\nstated she did not have communication with anyone from Guiding\nHarbor regarding Youth B being placed with FP. She stated when\nYouth A was placed with FP, Guiding Harbor provided her will all\nof the documents necessary to place her and asked MDHHS FCW\nto obtain FP’s signatures on some documents and send back to\nthem.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth B’s MISACWIS case record.\n-January 9, 2025, social work contact written by MDHHS\nFCW. A face-to-face visit was conducted with Youth B.\nYouth B stated that she is doing well and has no safety\nconcerns to report. Youth B stated that her visits over the\nbreak went well. Youth B stated that she is looking forward\nto being placed in the home with her sister.\n-January 23, 2025, written by MDHHS FCW. Placement\nchange TDM for Youth B as a foster home has been\nsecured and she has completed residential. The\nrecommendation for Youth B is to be released from the\nresidential and placed in a licensed foster home.\n-January 24, 2025, written by MDHHS FCW. A face-to-face\nvisit was conducted with Youth B. Youth B was discharged\n4",
    "from Whaley Children's Center. Youth B was taken to her\nfoster home placement with FP.\nAnalysis The agency is found to be in noncompliance. Although there was\nconfusion due to Whaley communicating directly with FP and not\nincluding MDHHS, MDHHS FCW (the agency with foster care\ncase management responsibility) was involved in conversations\nand transported Youth B to the foster home as noted in her social\nwork contacts. However, no communication occurred with\nMDHHS licensing department or Guiding Harbor licensing\ndepartment to ensure appropriate borrowed bed forms completed\nprior to placement.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n____________3/7/2025___________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 10, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
