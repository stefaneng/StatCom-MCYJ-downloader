DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThe Catholic Charities IEC Children’s Home (CCIEC) will be a private child caring\ninstitution operating within a facility located on the main campus of the parent\norganization in Lansing Charter Township. Upon arrival to the facility there is a\nlarge parking lot with administrative and other service provision buildings next\ndoor. When entering the facility there is a waiting area and a chapel. There is a\nlarge hallway that acts as the main thoroughfare for the facility, with office spaces,\ntherapeutic and medical offices and a full kitchen. At the end of the hallway there\nare four identical units with nine bedrooms apiece. Each unit has a common area\nfor grouping and recreation, a small kitchenette, storage and desk space for staff.\nYouth will have their own bedrooms within the facility. The units are connected in\npairs with the ability for secured locks to prevent entry when necessary. There\nare various recreation and self-care spaces inside the building as well as a full\ngymnasium. The building also has a separate education wing with three\n6",
    "classroom spaces and one additional space to meet the educational needs of\nyouth.\nAn Environmental Health Inspection was approved as of 03/11/2025 resulting in\nan “A” rating. A Fire Safety Inspection was completed on 04/09/2025 through the\nBureau of Fire Services with full approval provided. The Charter Township of\nLansing approved this property to be used in this capacity as of 05/24/2024. The\nfacility will have working cameras in multiple locations with the ability to record\nand save video.\nB. Program Description\nThe Catholic Charities IEC Children’s Home (CCIEC) is a private child caring\ninstitution intended to provide residential services for two distinct programs. The\nfacility will provide a non-secure treatment residential setting for unaccompanied\nrefugee minors (URM). These youth will have verified undocumented immigration\nstatuses. The facility has made nine beds available for both male and female\nyouth between the ages of six and 17. The URM programming is intended to\nprovide education, independent living skills, mental health treatment, case\nmanagement and community integration to youth in the immigration system.\nReferrals for potential placements will come from MDHHS or the Office of Global\nMichigan.\nCCIEC will also offer secure short term psychiatric residential treatment (PRTF) to\nmale and female youth aged six to 17, with 27 beds available. These youth will\nbe considered a person requiring treatment as defined by the Michigan Mental\nHealth Code. The PRTF programming is intended to stabilize and prepare youth\nfor reintegration into less restrictive environments. These youth will be provided\npsychiatric and mental health treatment. Referrals will come from MDHHS and\nother authorized sources.\nIneligible youth for both programs include those with a history of fire-setting,\nsevere aggression posing an active safety risk and medical needs requiring 24/7\nskilled nursing care as well as acute psychiatric conditions requiring\nhospitalization. The facility has provided policy & procedures that addresses the\nseparation of youth placed in the two separate programs with the facility. In\naddition, separate requirements have been provided for the supervision of youth.\nThe URM youth will be provided with a supervision ratio of 1:8 during waking\nhours and 1:12 during sleeping hours, and the corresponding ratios for PRTF\nyouth will be 1:4 and 1:7. The intended length of stay for both programs is three\nto 12 months.\nNewly placed youth in either program will receive orientation programming and\nwill learn about the highly structured daily schedules within the facility. The facility\nhas provided a behavior management curriculum that includes an approved\nphysical restraint model in Safety Care. CCIEC will not use seclusion as a\nbehavior management intervention in either program.\n7",
    "Medical and dental care for youth placed in the program will be provided by staff\nwithin the parent organization. Catholic Charities IEC has new medical and dental\nservices that have been opened on site and will be available to youth placed.\nEducation programming will be differentiated between the two programs. URM\nyouth will attend school within the Lansing School District with English as a\nSecond Language services being made available. PRTF youth will be enrolled in\neither the Lansing School District or an accredited private charter school,\nMichigan Connections Academy. All youth’s educational programming will be\nable to support special education accommodations and youth will earn credits\ntowards Michigan standards for graduation.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe facility has currently provided proposed compliance with all child caring\ninstitution licensing rules that apply to their programming.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on substantial compliance with the rules, it is recommended that a six-month\noriginal license be issued.\n04/28/2025\n________________________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved by:\nApril 28, 2025\n________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
