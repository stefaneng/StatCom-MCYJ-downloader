It states Youth A and B live in a\nhospital for sex offenders and that Staff Person 1 was supervising the\ngroup on 01/20/2023. Youth A and B were sitting next to each other at\n2",
    "their own table. Staff Person 1 suspected inappropriate behavior\nbetween the two and approached. It was discovered that Youth A had\nhis penis out of his pants though under his shirt and asked Youth B if\nhe wanted to touch it. Youth B touched Youth A’s penis and then Youth\nA asked if he could touch Youth B’s penis which he stated “yes”. Youth\nA then touched Youth B’s penis which was also out of his pants though\nunder his shirt. The touching between Youth A and B was consensual.\nYouth A and B have been separated and when their restrictions are\ncompleted will not be in groups together.\nI interviewed Complainant onsite on 01/24/2023. She reports no other\nconcerns other than what was noted in the intake. She states the\nfacility program is for youth who are sexual offenders. She states it is\nan unwritten policy that no two youth are to be sitting side-by-side\nwhich is discussed with staff during training. The incident noted\noccurred during free time in classroom B with approximately five to\nseven youths being supervised by Staff Person 1 and that the staff to\nresident ratio capacity is one staff to eight youths. It is reported that\nYouth A has been in his current placement for two plus years and that\nYouth B has been placed for five months.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite on 01/24/2023. He reports bringing out his\npenis from his pants and covering it with his shirt and that Youth B\ntouched it, and that Youth B then did the same. He states the\nexchange lasted a couple minutes before Staff Person 1 exclaimed,\n“Hey, what’s going on?” and approached the two. Youth A states that\nresidents are not allowed to sit next to each other, and that Staff Person\n1 did not stop them from sitting next to each other. Youth A states he\nhas received restrictions and has been separated from Youth B.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite on 01/24/2023. He reports sitting at the\ntable with Youth A sitting next to him and that Youth A asked if Youth B\nliked him which he stated that he did. He reports Youth A had pulled\nhis penis out from his pants though under his shirt and asked if he\nwanted to touch it which Youth B states he did. Youth B denies pulling\nout his own penis. He then reports Staff Person 1 called out his name\nand approached he and Youth A when they got up and walked around\nthe classroom. Youth B reports he received restrictions and has been\nseparated from Youth A.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 via telephone on 01/24/2023. She reports\nbeing employed by the facility for three months, received orientation,\nand has no disciplinary actions on her. She notes the youth placed at\nthe facility are sexual offenders requiring close supervision. She recalls\nbeing positioned in the center of the classroom and saw everyone\nnoting that she could see all youth’s hands. She states one youth was\n4",
    "pushing the desks together to create a large table and that Youth A and\nB were sitting next to each other though in separate desks which were\napproximately two and a half feet apart. She does not recall observing\nYouth A and B as they initially sat down though. Staff Person 1 states\nthat after approximately one minute of noticing Youth A and B sitting\nnext to each other that she observed Youth A’s arm move quickly away.\nShe recalls standing up to approach and asking Youths A and B what\nwas going on. She then states Youths A and B also stood up and\nwalked away from the desks as well, and that Supervisor eventually\ncame in and spoke with both youths separately. Staff Person 1 states\ninitially being told during training not to have residents sit side-by-side,\nand notes that sometimes they do while playing games, though a space\nbetween youth usually occurs. Staff Person 1 states that Youth A and\nB were sitting in separate desks, though placed next to each other, and\nthat she did not consider this arrangement as sitting side-by-side. She\nstates that it would not appear to be comfortable attempting to touch\nsomeone in another desk. Staff Person 1 states she relies on others\nand the supervisors to let her know if what she is doing is okay.\nI interviewed Supervisor onsite on 01/24/2023. She reports not being\nwitness to the incident or being in classroom B. Supervisor reports\nobserving Youth A in the hallway and Youth B “freaking out” inside the\nclassroom after the incident. She reports speaking with Youths A and\nB in which it was discovered that the two were sitting next to each other\nand touched each other’s exposed penis’. Supervisor states staff are\ntrained to not have residents sit next to each other though it is not a\nwritten policy.\nVideo surveillance for the date of the incident was not able to be\naccessed for review.\nAnalysis The facility had a sufficient number of direct care staff at time of the\nincident involving Youths A and B. However, staff present did not\nprovide for the continual needs, protection, and supervision of the youth\nin their sexual offender program by allowing the youths to sit side-by-\nside. Staff involved reports being told during training not to have\nresidents sit side-by-side though did not consider sitting in separate\ndesks, next to each other, as sitting side-by-side. It is noted that\nresidents do on occasion sit next to each for game time though spaced\napart. It is recommended that the facility further clarify resident spacing\nwhile sitting side-by-side during free time and structured gametime.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy.\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the that\nthe current license status be continued.\n02/02/2023\n_____________________________________\nChristopher Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/15/2023\n____________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
