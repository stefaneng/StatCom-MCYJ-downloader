Staff 1 placed Youth A in an\nincorrect hold. Youth A was laying on his back with his arms across his chest while\nStaff 1 was pushing down on Youth A. The hold Youth A should have been placed in\nwas a Satori hold that is an elbow to hip hold.\nYouth A’s case file was reviewed. Youth A has been physically aggressive while at\nhis current placement. He is diagnosed with FASD, ADHD, unspecified mood\ndisorder, and a developmental disorder.\n2",
    "On 2/23/21 the Foster Care Worker (FCW) set up a video call with Youth A and the\nfacility to go over a safety plan. Due to the facility being under quarantine due to\nCOVID-19 all meetings were conducted virtually. The FCW and this consultant went\nover the safety plan with Youth A and the facility. Staff 1 will not have interaction with\nYouth A until the investigation has been completed. Youth A listed off several staff\nhe can go to and a relative he can call if he is feeling unsafe. Youth A repeated over\nand over again how Staff 1 was a bully. He frequently changed the subject to things\nhe wanted bought for him.\nAn Incident Report was written by Staff 2. The incident occurred on 2/22/21 at\n8:30am. The incident report stated that Youth A was sitting in the staff office with\nStaff 2, Staff 3, and his peers when Staff 1 walked in and plugged in his Airpods.\nStaff 1 told Youth A \"you better not mess with these or else I will mess up your stuff.\"\nYouth A called Staff 1 a bully. Youth A then hit his head on the desk and hit the\ncomputer mouse on the desk. Youth A left the office and walked into the milieu\nhallway. Staff wouldn't let him back in the office. Youth A banged his head on the\nground many times and very hard, then he got up and did the same on the walls in\nthe milieu. He then started hitting the office door. Staff 1 told Youth A \"don't do that\nor I will contain you.\" Youth A started crying and yelling. Youth A said Staff 1 was a\nbully. Youth A then wrapped his arms around Staff 2's legs. Staff 1 pulled Youth A's\narms off and initiated a containment that was not SATORI approved at 8:41am. Staff\n1 had Youth A's arms across Youth A's chest. Youth A was face up and Staff 1 was\non top with Youth A on the bottom. Youth A was crying and Staff 2 told Staff 1 to get\noff him. Staff 1 did not acknowledge Staff 2, so Staff 2 asked two more times. Staff 1\nthen got off of Youth A at 8:44am. Youth A got up and kicked Staff 1 then Staff 2.\nYouth A wrapped his arms around Staff 2's legs again and again Staff 1 pulled Youth\nA off and initiated an incorrect containment at 8:46am. Staff 1 was on top of Youth A.\nStaff 2 told Staff 1 \"I got this just get off. Staff 1 let go of Youth A at 8:47am. Youth A\nthen ran towards Staff 2 and Staff 2 ran around the milieu with him following. Youth\nA was not able to outrun staff. Then Staff 2 stopped for a moment and offered Youth\nA her hands to squeeze. Youth A grabbed Staff 2's shirt collar, but he was not\npulling or hitting. Staff 1 pulled Youth A off of Staff 2 and told Staff 2 that Youth A\n\"knows he can get away with this around you guys,\" referring to Staff 2 and Staff 3.\nStaff 1 told Staff 2 to go into the office. Staff 2 went into the office. After 30 minutes\nof yelling Youth A de-escalated on his own with Staff 1 present. At 9am Staff 1 told\neveryone the unit was clear. Youth A said he wanted to go into the office again. Staff\n3 said Youth A had to sit in the milieu with his peer and Staff 1. Youth A asked for\nanyone except for Staff 1. He did not want to sit with Staff 1, but he had to sit in the\nmilieu with Staff 1 to do his school work. The report indicated that Youth A did not\nsustain any injuries.\nThe restraint training materials were reviewed. The restraint method utilized by the\nfacility is called SATORI. The techniques taught by this training teach staff to hold\nyouth from the back or side. There is not a technique in which a youth lays on his\nback and staff stand or kneel over the youth holding them down from over the top of\nthem.\n3",
    "All interviews took place on 2/24/21. These interviews were conducted virtually due\nto COVID-19. The Chief Administrator (CA) sat in on all interviews.\nTherapist Interview: The Therapist stated he could provide some insight into the\ndynamics of the unit Youth A is on. He stated that the staff on Youth A's unit, C side,\nare working on setting better boundaries with the youth. The youth put their hands\non the staff and rather than disengaging they try to de-escalate them in that moment.\nWhen staff from the other units come over and they set those limits it escalates the\nyouth. This is especially true with Youth A. Staff 1 is an example of a staff who sets\nthose boundaries. He is more stern and firm which is a different approach than the\nother staff. The therapist said he is working with Youth A on this. He tried to debrief\nwith Youth A but all he would say was that Staff 1 was a bully. Youth A does not\nhave a lot of restraints.\nYouth A Interview: Youth A demonstrated he could follow the rules for Forensic\nInterviewing. Youth A stated he lives on C Side. He listed several staff he likes that\nwork with him. He stated he does not like Staff 1 because Staff 1 stomped on his\nfoot and his hand. Youth A said he was angry when this happened, and it was not\nduring a restraint. Staff 1 was hurting his hand by holding it. Staff 1 also blocked\nYouth A from getting to Staff 3 and saying goodbye to Staff 3.\nYouth A was unable to stay on topic and could not provide any more details.\nStaff 2 Interview: Staff 2 reported the kids were in the office and Staff 1 was trying\nto plug in his Airpods. Staff 1 told the youth not to mess with his Airpods. Youth A\nthen hit his peer with a wad of paper. He was prompted to leave the office and Staff\n3 guided him out. They would not let him back in the office because he was\naggressive with his peer. Youth A wrapped his arms around Staff 2's legs. Staff 1\npulled Youth A off of Staff 2 and held Youth A by his wrists then placed him in a\ncontainment (restraint). Staff 1 was on his knees next to Youth A while Youth A was\nlaying on his back. Staff 1 held Youth A's arms crossed over his chest. Staff 1 was\npressing Youth A's arms down onto his chest. Youth A said he could not breath.\nStaff 2 told Staff 1 to get off Youth A. He got off Youth A then Youth A began to hit\nand kick Staff 2. Staff 1 placed Youth A in another containment holding Youth A the\nsame way he did previously. Youth A had grabbed Staff 2’s shirt and that is when\nStaff 1 told him he should not be out there with Youth A. Staff 2 went into the office\nand did not see anything further.\nStaff 2 did not think the containment was approved because Youth A was on his\nback with Staff 1 kneeling over the top of him rather than Staff 1 being behind Youth\nA with Youth A on his side. Also, Youth A's hands were at his shoulders not at his\nwaist. Staff 2 felt the containment did not need to happen. Youth A was hitting staff\nbut not hard enough to hurt. They would have been fine without a containment.\nYouth A tends to calm down if he runs around the unit with staff. Staff 2 had talked to\nStaff 1 after the incident and Staff 1 said he felt Youth A needed to be contained for\nStaff 2’s safety. Staff 2 did not see any injuries on Youth A.\n4",
    "Staff 2 stated they go over any behavior plans the youth have in team meetings and\ndiscuss any behavioral issues during those meetings. With Youth A they are to hold\nhis hands and let him squeeze them and have him take deep breaths. These\ntechniques are communicated to all staff that work with Youth A.\nStaff 3 Interview: Staff 3 reported Youth A was in the office and a comment was\nmade by Staff 1 about not touching his things or there would be issues. Staff 1 said\nthis jokingly to the youth. Youth A took a computer mouse and slammed it into a\npeer’s hand. Youth A was taken out of the office and he grabbed onto her and Staff\n2. Staff 1 grabbed Youth A's wrists. Youth A pulled away and began to hit and kick\nthe staff. Staff 1 still had Youth A's wrists then he put Youth A's arms crossed over\nhis chest while Youth A was laying on the ground on his back. She stated that Staff\n1 was putting pressure on Youth A's chest or abdomen. She stated the containment\nwas not supposed to be with the youth on his back. When Youth A was calm Staff 1\nasked Staff 3 to talk to Youth A. Youth A told her Staff 1 was bullying him. Youth A\ntold her Staff 1 hurt his wrist and hands but she could not tell if it was from the\ncontainment or from Youth A harming himself as he has scratches all over his hands\nfrom self-harming. Youth A's stomach was red and a mark was on his forehead from\nhim banging his head.\nStaff 3 stated that Youth A has an issue with men in general not just Staff 1. Youth A\nsays all male staff bully him. Staff 1 jokes around with the kids but Youth A cannot\nhandle the joking.\nStaff 1 Interview: When Staff 1 walked into the office and plugged in his Airpods he\nwas playing around with another youth about not touching his Airpods. Youth A then\nattacked Staff 2. Staff 1 sat back and let Staff 2 handle it. When Youth A grabbed\nStaff 2's collar Staff 1 stepped between them. Staff 1 tried to get Youth A's hands off\nof Staff 2's collar. Staff 2 ran around with Youth A. Youth A then laid on the floor and\nwrapped his arms around Staff 2's legs. Youth A tried to bite Staff 2 so Staff 1\nstepped in and removed Youth A from Staff 2's legs. Youth A was on his knees at\nfirst then flopped onto his back on the floor. Staff 1 was standing over Youth A while\nholding Youth A's arms across Youth A's chest. Staff 1 told Staff 2 to go to the office\nsince he was the target of Youth A's aggression. When Staff 2 went into the office he\nlet go of Youth A. Youth A did say he could not breath while he was laying on the\nfloor and Staff 1 was holding him. Staff 1 then let Youth A go. Staff 1 stated he was\nnot putting any pressure on Youth A's chest. He was holding Youth A's wrists at\nYouth A's sides. Youth A was not hurt.\nStaff 1 reported he has been on C side for about a month and he is not familiar with\nYouth A's behavior plan. He is the staff that they call when they cannot handle a\nsituation. The other staff do not let him deal with Youth A to let him build rapport with\nhim.\n5",
    "An exit conference was held with the CA. She indicated that the same staff deal with\nthe same kids so not all staff would be familiar with Youth A's behavior plan, but all\nstaff are supposed to review the youth's treatment plan. They are working on\nchanging the dynamics on C side so all staff are on the same page and can support\neach other.\nStaff 1’s Employee File: Staff 1 was hired on 10/8/18 and had his last restraint\nrefresher on 10/20/20. He has three disciplines in his file for excessive cell phone\nuse, leaving shift without permission, and too many breaks leaving staff out of ratio.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nRule 1 Prohibition of Prone Restraint; Procedures Involving Other\nRestraints in Child Caring Institutions\n(2) Resident restraint must be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: Staff 2 and Staff 3 both stated Staff 1 had Youth A on his back\nwith his arms across his chest while Staff 1 pressed down on\nYouth A’s arms. Staff 1 did admit that Youth A was on the\nground on his back. This technique has not been approved as\nthe facility’s restraint technique. Pressing on a youth’s chest is\nnot a safe way to perform a restraint.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nThis is a repeat violation cited under R 400.4159 Resident\nrestraint during Special Investigation 2019C0223057 with a CAP\naccepted on 10/07/19.\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan it is recommended that this\ninvestigation be closed with no further licensing action.\n3/23/21\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 24, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
