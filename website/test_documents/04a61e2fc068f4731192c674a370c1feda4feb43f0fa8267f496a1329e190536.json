    "summary": "The report investigated two allegations against Hands Across the Water: that a foster care worker left youth unsupervised in a cold vehicle, and that the agency refused to involve parents in treatment plans. The investigation found no evidence to support the vehicle allegation, as interviews and documentation confirmed a caregiver was present during all transports. Regarding parent involvement, documentation showed the biological mother was offered the treatment plan but refused to sign it, though she did attend meetings and parenting time. The investigation concluded no violations were established for either allegation, effectively clearing the agency of culpability.",
