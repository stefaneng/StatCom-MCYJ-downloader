Staff 2 reported she\nhas never said she has seen Staff 5 sleeping on shift because\nwhen they work together, she works upstairs and he’s downstairs.\nStaff 2 reported she doesn’t work with Staff 4 and, therefore, has\nnever seen him sleeping. Staff 2 reported she worked with Staff 3\none time, but never saw him sleeping. Staff 2 reported she was\ndoing laundry one night and Staff 3 wasn’t in the living room, so\nshe assumed Staff 3 must be in the sensory room sleeping. Staff\n2 reported she has never seen any staff sleeping in the house\nwhen they’re supposed to be working. Staff 2 reported Staff 3,\nStaff 4 and Staff 5 do not complete bed checks for the youth in the\nhome, and she is the only one completing them.

Staff 2 was unable to provide\ndates or timeframes for when these conversations occurred.\nHowever, Staff 2 reported she would send screenshots of the text\nmessages she sent to Administrator/LD regarding her concerns.\nStaff 2 initially reported she wasn’t working on 1/24/24, the night\nthe door was left open, so she doesn’t know anything about it.\nHowever, when informed she was seen on video exiting the door\nprior to it being left open, she changed her story. Staff 2 reported\nshe walked out of the door first and then Staff 7 walked out after\nher. Staff 2 reported she assumed Staff 7 left the door open\nbecause Staff 7 had a lot of stuff in her hands. When asked why\nshe didn’t check if the door was shut or ask Staff 7 if she shut the\ndoor, Staff 2 reported she was not thinking about the door being\nopen or shut. Staff 2 reported if the door was left open, third shift\nstaff should have caught it if they were doing their observation\nchecks and laundry on shift like they’re supposed to. Staff 2\nreported there’s no policy to check the outside doors and make\nsure they’re locked.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 2/21/24 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported he picks up various shifts\nat the facility, and most recently worked separate shifts with Staff\n4 and Staff 2.

Staff 4 reported after midnight, Staff 6 went to get\nhis charger and found the back door open. Staff 4 reported there\nis a door alarm that chimes when the door is open and the\nsecurity system says, “back door open”, so they knew no one had\ncome in during their shift. Staff 4 reported they didn’t know how\nthe door was left open, or how long it was left open. Staff 4\nreported the basement door is locked and he and Staff 6 were in\nthe living room most of the time, so they knew no one had come\ninto the house and gone in the basement or upstairs. Staff 4\nreported he did not hear Staff 7 ask him or Staff 6 to shut the door\nwhen she was leaving. Staff 4 reported there have never been\ntimes when he has fully fallen asleep during a shift, but he has\ndozed off a few times.

However, they haven’t been\nchecking cameras regularly since there have been changes in the\nleadership team. Administrator 1 reported after she received the\nallegations, she reviewed camera footage and found Staff 5\nsleeping on shift. Administrator 1 reported she found Staff 3, Staff\n4, and Staff 5 were not completing bed checks as required during\nvarious shifts. Administrator 1 reported she spoke with Staff 4,\nwho reported he was doing checks at first, but the kids were\nalways fine, so he didn’t see the point in doing them anymore.\nAdministrator 1 reported since she had the conversation with Staff\n4 the weekend of 2/10-2/11/24, he has been doing the checks\nconsistently. Administrator 1 reported she watched camera\nfootage the entire weekend and was messaging/calling staff if they\nwere not completing checks as required. For example,\nAdministrator 1 reported she saw on live-camera, Staff 2 was\nmissing bed checks or was not doing them in variable intervals, so\nshe was messaging Staff 2 to tell her it was time for a check or\nproviding directions for how to complete the checks. Administrator\n1 reported she spoke with Staff 5 regarding bed checks, and Staff\n5 completed every bed check required that weekend.\nAdministrator 1 reported she also spoke with Staff 6 about bed\nchecks, and he is also making immediate changes based on the\nfeedback received.
