    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe facility has not had any residents or staff during this period under review and does\nnot have an active contract. Therefore, there were no files to review, and thus, no\nviolations.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility did not require technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nIn November 2020, the agency chose to voluntarily transfer all of the youth and staff\nout of Donna Maria and Lourdes Halls and have not serviced youth under this license\nsince that time. If the agency decides to accept referrals on this license in the future,\nthey have agreed to notify me beforehand and I will provide consultation to address\nany changes in programming and/or the terms of the license.\nVista Maria is currently considering a number of different programs for this license\nbased on the needs of potential contractors. In February 2021, I notified the chief\nadministrator that firm decisions on the direction of the license should made prior to\nthe expiration date of 04/08/23 or the license may not be renewed.\nThere were no DCWL investigations or corrective action plans submitted during this\nlicensing period and no substantiated abuse/neglect or corporal punishment.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is compliant with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the facility continue on their regular\nlicense.\nMarch 24, 2022\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n1",
