On\nanother occasion, a staff member was verbally abusive to youth by\nswearing at youth and threatening to hit youth.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on 12/01/2022.\nI interviewed the Youth A’s Foster Care Specialist, who was also the\ncomplainant, via phone on 12/02/2022. Youth A was placed at the\nfacility on 10/19/2022 and has been struggling because she does not\nlike her placement.

There are\nseveral incident reports involving Youth A, and she is the one that is\nswearing and is physically aggressive with staff and other youths when\nshe does not get her way. Youth A instigates fights and has physically\nlashed out at the other youths at the facility. She was suspended off the\nschool bus this week for cussing on the bus.

Youth A reported she is\nreceiving therapy, gets her medication daily, and likes the food. When\nasked about the allegations Youth A got up and walked out of the room.\nI followed Youth A to the hallway where she was standing with the\nDirector.

She said last week Youth A was yelling and\nstomping her feet and when she tried to redirect her, Youth A started to\nscream “this is abuse.” Staff 2 reported that she and other staff try to\ndeescalate the situations with Youth A by talking to her and removing\nthe other youths from the room and that she usually helps her calm\ndown.\nI spoke with Youth A’s Therapist via telephone on 12/12/2022.\nTherapist reported she meets weekly with Youth A for individual\nsessions and Youth A has not reported any concerns regarding staff or\nthe facility.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n• Incident Report,11/27/2022, authored by Staff 2. Report was\nconsistent with Staff 2’s interview.\n• Incident Report, 11/29/2022, authored by staff 2. Reports Youth A\ncussing and using racial slurs with Staff 2.\n4",
    "• Incident Report, 12/01/2022, Youth A was suspended from the school\nbus 12/1/22 to 12/06/22 due to swearing and being loud with the other\nkids on the bus.\n• Staff 1’s employee file, No disciplinary action reports.\n• Reviewed facility’s Behavior Management Policies and Practices:\nResident Behavior Management and consequences are based on the\nbasic understanding of your Treatment Plan goals and objectives.\nWhile a wide variety of consequences may be used, these are never to\nbe excessively punitive or self-defeating. It is clearly understood that\ncorporal punishment, in any form (i.e. spanking, paddling, slapping,\npinching, twisting arms, holding or pulling hair, etc.) is not to be used by\nany staff member. Likewise, verbal abuse (i.e. swearing, cursing,\nprofanities, obscene gestures, ridiculing, sarcasm or unflattering\nnicknames, etc.) are not to be used by any staff member. Excessive\nchemical, mechanical or physical restraints are prohibited. Staff\nmembers are not permitted to deny you any essential program\nservices.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is no supporting evidence\nthat these allegations occurred. Youth A provided changing accounts\nthat were not supported by the identified staff and other youth, who\nreported that Youth A is the one that is using derogatory language with\nstaff and other youths.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy.\nIt is recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJanuary 8, 2023\n____________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 20, 2023\n_____________________________________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
