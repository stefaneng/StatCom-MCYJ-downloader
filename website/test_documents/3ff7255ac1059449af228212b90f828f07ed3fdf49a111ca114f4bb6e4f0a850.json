INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications: volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry.\nDescription (2)A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nand able to meet the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency's licensing worker used inappropriate and derogatory\nlanguage when talking about the foster parent. This worker's\nbehavior was very unprofessional and disrespectful toward the\nfoster parent.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 2/21/2025 I spoke with Complainant about the allegations by\ntelephone. Complainants confirmed the information as reported by\nFoster Parent A.\nOn 2/21/2025 I interviewed Foster Parent A by telephone. Foster\nParent A confirmed the allegations in the complaint. Foster\nParent A reported on 2/14/2025 her licensing worker, Licensing\nWorker (LW) 1’s work phone accidentally called them while LW 1\nand LW 2, were talking on another phone. Foster Parent A\nreported LW 2 is the worker who completed a recent special\nevaluation against their foster home; and the first thing they heard\nduring the call between the two workers was LW 2 talking\ndisparaging, disrespectfully, and unprofessionally about them as a\nfoster parent. LW 2 was heard calling her “Bitch” numerous times.\nSuch as “that bitch lets those children do whatever the fuck they\nwant”; that’s why one foster child wants to go back to “that bitches\nhouse because she can do whatever she wants”. Foster Parent A\nreported the conversation between LW 1 and LW 2 went on for\ntwo-minutes until LW 1 hung up the phone. Foster Parent A said\nLW 1 called them back reporting that LW 1’s phone had\naccidentally called them. LW 1 asked how much they heard and\nFoster Parent A responded enough to know that they want to have\ntheir case (the special evaluation) dismissed. Foster Parent A said\nthey told LW 1 they heard LW 2 call them all kind or “bitches”. LW\n1 tried to explain that was just how they, as younger females,\nspeak when talking about other females.\n2",
    "Foster Parent A reported a concern that LW 2 is bias against them\nand that the behavior demonstrated by LW 2 proves that. Foster\nParent A reported believing the attitude she described above for\nLW 2(not the language) was on display when LW 2 was\nconducting the recent special evaluation against their foster home.\nA special evaluation that resulted in the foster children’s\nreplacement from Foster Parent A’s foster home and a\nrecommendation by the agency for revocation of their license.\nFoster Parent A stated they felt LW 2 was hostile in her tone at the\nfirst foster home visit, and they did not believe what LW 2\nassessed or observed during LW 2’s visit to their foster home.\nDuring a meeting LW 2 reported the foster children did not love\nthem, disagreed with statements made by them. Foster Parent A\ndid not provide any other specific behavior by LW 2 to explain why\nthey thought there was proof that LW 2 was bias against them.\nFoster Parent A admitted to speaking with an agency supervisor\nabout her concern with LW 2 Foster Parent A said they called\nLicensing Supervisor 1 (LS 1) and left a message, but LS 1 did not\ncall them back until after Licensing Supervisor 2 (LS 2) received\nthe email of the complaint that was sent to Lansing. Foster Parent\nA said prior to this incident they had a meeting with LS 1, LW 1\nand LW 2 about their special evaluation and the proposed\nrecommendation for their foster home license.\nI had communication with Chief Administrator (CA) about the\nallegations by email on 2/20/2025 and 3/5/2025. Chief\nAdministrator indicated this incident was brought to her attention\nthe day it occurred. She indicated Licensing Supervisor 1\nreported it to Section Manager who alerted her. CA reported they\nmet with their labor relations representative, reassigned the case\nto someone else, and LS 1 made attempts to remedy the\nsituation. CA reported the agency was also alerted of this incident\nthrough Division of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL) Director after\na complaint was received from the DCWL team.\nOn 3/5/2025 I interviewed LS 1 and LW 1 via TEAMS separately. I\ninterviewed LW 2 via TEAM on 3/6/2025. All three staff persons\nreported the allegation of LW 2 using derogatory language, the\nword “Bitch” in discussing and referencing Foster Parent A was\ntrue. The staff persons reported on how this incident came to be.\nLS 1 reported she is the supervisor for the agency’s special\nevaluation unit; and this is why she was involved related to this\nincident. She reported LW 1 is Foster Parent A’s ongoing\n3",
    "Licensing worker and LW 2 is the worker completing a special\nevaluation pertaining to Foster Parent A’s foster home. LS 1 said\nLW 1 and LW 2 contacted her separately after the incident\noccurred to give her a heads up about what had happened. Both\nLW 1 and LW 2 told her that LW 2 was venting to LW 1 by way of\ntheir personal cells about incidents that happened related to the\nspecial evaluation. Foster Parent A had contacted LW 2 and was\ndenying all that was assessed to be going on related to the special\nevaluation. LW 2 called LW 1 and was expressing her\nfrustrations, when LW 1 other phone accidentally called Foster\nParent A and Foster Parent A heard a portion of the telephone\nconversation between LW 1 and L W 2. LS 1 said LW 2 did not\nsay specifically why she was so frustrated, but LS 1 stated that\nFoster Parent A has a tendency to repeatedly phone and email\nstaff several times a day, and that behavior can be frustrating. LS\n1 reported LW 2 told her repetitive contacting behavior had\noccurred by Foster Parent A the day of this telephone incident.\nLS 1 said LW 1 and LW 2 both admitted LW 2 used negative\nlanguage in talking about Foster Parent A, and used the “B” word\nin referencing Foster Parent A.\nLS 1 reported Foster Parent A contacted her about the workers’\ntelephone incident, and she listened to Foster Parent A. She let\nFoster Parent A voice her concern; and advised Foster Parent A\nthat she would follow up on the matter; and she did. She said LW\n2 and LW 1 were given disciplinary actions related to using their\npersonal phone and discussing agency business. She reported,\nLW 1 action was more a discussion and LW 2 received a formal\nverbal counseling by way of a Memo of Expectation. LS 1\nreported neither worker had received prior disciplinary actions.\nLS 1 reported Foster Parent A’s special evaluation and what\ntranspired between LW 1 and LW 2 during the telephone call were\nseparate matters. There was no need to transfer the case related\nto that; as the special evaluation had been completed. The\nagency met with Foster Parent A related to the special evaluation,\nand the agency’s recommendation for revocation.\nLW 1 confirmed information as indicated by LS 1. LW 1 added\nthat she and LW 2 were not at the agency at the time of their\ntelephone conversation. LW 2 called her, and they were on their\npersonal cell phones. She said LW 2 contacted her because\nFoster Parent A had been calling and texting long conversations\nto she and LW 2, due to the agency’s recommendation about the\nspecial evaluation. She said LW 2 was voicing her frustration\nabout that, and LW 2’s disappointments about the case. LW 1\n4",
    "was unsure how her work phone somehow dialed Foster Parent\nA. She reported realizing it had about two minutes into their\nconversation, so she advised LW 2 she would hang up and call\nFoster Parent A. During her call to Foster Parent A, she inquired\nof Foster Parent A what had Foster Parent A heard and Foster\nParent A said she heard LW 2 called her the “B” word, meaning\nbitch, and that it was unprofessional. Foster Parent A asked her\nwhether LW 1 felt such was unprofessional and LW 1 said she\nagreed it was adverse. LW 1 tried to explain to Foster Parent A,\nthat sometimes when women talk, they use the “B” word in talking.\nShe also admitted in other scenarios their use of the “B” word has\nusually been within a friendship content, and since Foster Parent\nA is a client/customer it was unprofessional. LW 1 reported this\nwas her first time hearing LW 2 to use the “B” word language to\nrefer to a foster parent. LW 1 repeated, LW 2 was upset related\nFoster Parent A’s behavior, and what had occurred related to the\nchildren in the foster home; and LW 2 was frustrated and just\nventing that frustration.\nLW 1 reported since Foster Parent A asked for LW 2’s supervisor,\nshe texted LS 1 to apprise LS 1 of what had occurred. An\ninformal meeting was held with her by LS 1 and Section Manager\nrelated to the incident and her involvement in it.\nLW 2 confirmed information as reported by LS 1 and LW 1 related\nto the telephone call between she and LW 1; what transpired\nduring the call; how the telephone came to be; her using LW 1 as\na sounding board to vent her frustration about Foster Parent A’s\nbehavior, and the special evaluation, and the consequence for her\ndue to language she used toward Foster Parent A during the call.\nLW 2 denied any bias or negative feelings toward Foster Parent A\nimpacting her actions on any special evaluation.\nOn 3/5/2025 I interviewed LS 2 via TEAMS. I Interviewed LS 3 via\nTEAMS on 3/6/2024.\nLicensing Supervisor 2 (LS 2) is LW 1’s immediate supervisor\nand Licensing Supervisor 3 (LS 3) is LW 2’s immediate\nsupervisor. Neither LS 2 nor LS 3 had direct knowledge of the\nallegations. Both had been informed of the incident and resulting\ndisciplinary action for LW 2 by the Section Manager. Neither LS\n2 or LS 3 reported LW 1 or LW 2 having any prior disciplinary\nactions or concerns related to their interaction and treatment to\nfoster parents or caregivers.\n5",
    "Documentation Reviewed:\n• Memorandum dated 2/21/2025 from LS 1 to LW 2\nindicating a formal verbal warning. That moving forward LW\n2 will adhere to following professional standards by:\nRespectful Conduct, treating all clients and colleagues with\nprofessionalism whether they are present or not; Discretion\nin Conversations, by being mindful of where and how she\nengages in conversations, ensuring all conversations\nremain private; Company Representation by remembering\nher behavior reflects MDHHS and must align with\nMDHSS’s values, professionalism, respect and integrity.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and document review, the evidence showed\nLW 2 used derogatory words, and unprofessional language when\nconversing with a coworker about a foster parent, and the foster\nparent’s behavior/case during normal work hours. The workers’\ntelephone conversation was inadvertently overheard by Foster\nParent A. In this instance the worker did not demonstrate the\nresponsible character suitable to meet the needs of children and\nfamilies served by the agency.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nApril 22, 2025\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 23, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
