    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents' needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency is not providing adequate services, resulting in a large\nnumber of youths going to the emergency department.\nInvestigation On 11/22/24 Complainant reported a concerning number of\nyouths from Vista Maria were dropped at local hospital emergency\ndepartments within the last 48 hours. There is concern the agency\nis not providing proper care and programming to prevent the youth\nfrom needing care in the emergency department.\nInterviews:\nChief Administrator, Rights Officer, and Quality Manager were\ncontacted on 11/22/24 by email to obtain the names of youth that\nwere seen at a hospital from 11/19/24-11/22/24.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth A reported participating in therapy one or two days per\nweek. Activities on the unit included coloring, drawing, playing\ngames, going outside, and watching movies. Youth A stated an\noutside group came to the unit at times to do organized activities\nwith youth. Youth A stated groups were held several times per\nweek, but she refused to participate. Youth A attended online\nschool, due to ongoing behavioral issues, but wished to attend\nschool in person again. Youth A reported behaviors include hitting\nstaff, self-harming, fighting, and breaking things on the unit. Youth\nA stated police were called to the unit when youth physically\nattacked staff and would not stop, or when youth were self-\nharming or suicidal. Youth were sent to the hospital when suicidal,\nself-harming, or if injured from fighting a peer. Youth A stated in\nher experience, police always transported youth to the hospital\nand agency staff followed behind in a car, then stayed with youth\nwhile at the hospital. When asked what the agency could do to\nbetter support her and decrease incidents, Youth A stated,\n2",
    "“nothing, they can’t stop me, I’m crazy.” Youth A indicated when\nher mind was made up, there was nothing staff could do or say to\nstop her. If Youth A wanted to hurt someone, or tear up the unit,\nshe would do it no matter what. Youth A stated staff talk to her,\noffer the calming room, her therapist for support, or other activities\nto do, but she would not listen to staff. Youth A could not think of\nanything staff could do differently to help her. However, Youth A\nfelt the program could do a better job of rewarding youth with good\nbehavior.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth B reported participating in therapy weekly and found it to be\nhelpful. Youth A stated groups were held daily, but she did not\nalways participate as it was usually an activity on paper that she\ndid not find helpful. Youth B reported she was able to make phone\ncalls to family every day, and she was able to draw or read daily.\nYouth B stated there were no organized, recreational activities\navailable to youth and they sat on the unit all day, “doing nothing”.\nYouth B indicated Journey To Success (JTS) was a group of\npeople that came to the unit to do activities and independent living\nskills. However, JTS was no longer occurring. Youth B stated she\nwished they did more activities and included exercise or\nmovement daily. Youth B reported some youth were able to go on\noutings to go shopping. Youth B felt this was favoritism by staff\nand not based on behavior, although she could not explain why.\nYouth B wished there were more outings and fun activities\nplanned. However, she acknowledged that behavior of youth\nimpacts staff ability to do things. For example, Youth A had\nfrequent violent outbursts, attacking staff, breaking windows, and\nfighting peers. This behavior caused staff to be busy deescalating\nYouth A, rather than doing activities with the other youth. Youth B\nreported police were called to the facility when youth were\nphysically acting out and creating weapons to hurt people. Youth\nB gave the example of one youth making a “shank” with a pencil\nand metal from a pencil sharpener at school. The youth attempted\nto stab staff. Staff tried to talk with the youth and get the object\nfrom them. Eventually, they contacted police for assistance. Youth\nB also observed staff to call the police when a youth was suicidal,\nself-harming, or swallowing things they should not, and they need\nto go to the hospital to be evaluated. Staff always tried to talk to\nyouth and redirect them, but that did not always work. Youth B\nstated police always take youth to the hospital and staff follow in\nanother car. When asked what the facility could change to better\n3",
    "meet the youth needs, Youth B stated they need to plan more\noutings and activities to encourage the youth to have good\nbehavior to earn those things.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth C stated she participated in therapy twice a week and group\nseveral times per week. Group consisted of journaling, talking,\nand self-help worksheets. Youth C reported there were no\norganized activities, since JTS was no longer active. Youth B\nstated they never use the gym or go outside. They do not have\nmovies, games, or crafts because the girls always argued about\nthings. Youth C stated she often stayed in her room to read or\nstudy for school. Youth C would like to do more activities off the\nwing. However, her peer’s behavior prevented that from\nhappening. Youth C stated they were not punished as a group, but\nwhen one youth would act out over several hours, it would disrupt\nthe plans for the day. Youth were not able to cross wings and join\nactivities in another wing. Youth C stated she felt they needed\nmore staff that are specialized in mental health crisis to assist\nwhen youth are acting out. Youth C acknowledged that team\nleaders, supervisors, and therapists were called to the unit when\nthere were problems. Staff would talk with youth, give them space,\nand try to get them to engage in another activity, but it did not\nalways work. Police were called to the unit for “big stuff”, such as\nwhen youth were self-harming, attacking staff, and breaking\nwindows or doors. Staff handle everything else. Youth C stated\nthat youth were sent to the hospital if they were injured or had\nself-harmed and it was more serious than what the on-site nurse\ncan handle. Youth C noted if the police came to campus, youth\nwere automatically taken to the hospital by police. Staff always\nfollowed the police to the hospital to stay with youth.\nYouth D was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nYouth D reported she felt staff were helpful and easy to talk with.\nYouth D stated a typical day consists of attending school,\nsnacks/meals, daily therapy, and groups a few times per week.\nActivities include reading, television, and movies. Youth D\nreported there recently were not many organized activities or\nopportunities to go outside or leave the facility for events. Youth D\ndid not have any concerns about the services received in the\nprogram. Youth D reported she did not have any experience with\nthe police on campus, or going to the hospital. However, her\nunderstanding was that staff would call the police for assistance if\nyouth were being violent, and staff could not get them to calm\ndown. Youth would go to the hospital if they harmed themselves\nor were injured by a peer.\n4",
    "Youth E was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nYouth E reported they participated in weekly therapy and groups a\nfew times per week. Youth E stated they also colored, played\ngames, diamond art, reading, chores, hygiene, and made phone\ncalls in the evening. Youth E stated staff were helpful, but\ninconsistent with planning activities and addressing behaviors.\nYouth E indicated staff let some youth get away with more than\nothers. If there were any issues, staff talk with youth and try to\nhelp them. Youth E stated police came to the facility when youth\nwere assaulting people and not listening to staff. The police\nalways took the youth to the hospital, then staff followed and\nstayed at the hospital with them. Youth E stated youth also went\nto the hospital if they swallowed something or self-harmed in\nanother way.\nYouth F was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nYouth F reported attending therapy weekly and groups on the unit\ndaily. Youth F had daily phone calls to family, case worker, or\nlawyer. When youth were not in school, they had some down time\nand could draw or read. Youth also participated in activities that\nwere organized by someone that visited the unit, although she\ncould not recall what that was called. Youth F stated peer’s\nbehaviors sometimes effected their ability to have activities. Police\nwere called to the facility if a youth’s behavior was out of control\nand staff were unsuccessful at calming them down. Police\nsometimes spoke to youth and sometimes took them to the\nhospital. Staff always sat with youth at the hospital.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nStaff 1 stated she believed everything was going well in the\nprogram and the youth received the support they needed. Staff 1\nstated youth participate in therapy and support groups. Youth also\ncolor, play cards and talk to staff. Staff 1 did not think there was\nanything that needed to be done differently to support youth.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nStaff 2 reported youth attend school and therapy daily and have\nphone calls with family or case workers daily. Youth also have\nactivities such as games, drawing, coloring, listening to music, and\ndiamond art. Each youth could do different activities based on\ntheir level and behavior. Staff 2 felt the program was supportive to\nyouth. Staff 2 stated administration was supportive to staff, and\nthey were provided with enough useful training to assist youth.\n5",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nStaff 3 stated youth participate in activities such as painting\ncanvasses, diamond art, card games, and coloring. There was a\nvolunteer group that came to the unit to do scheduled activities\nwith youth. Youth also participate in daily therapy and groups a\nfew times per week. Groups included activity sheets, discussion of\nissues, and understanding music lyrics. These activities were\noffered to all youth, but youth did not always participate. Staff tried\nto get everyone involved, but sometimes youth chose not to be.\nStaff 3 stated police were called to the unit when there was\nsignificant property damage, severe self-harming, or violent youth\nthat were harming people and staff were not able to successfully\ndeescalate. Staff would contact supervisors, as they made the\ndecision to call the police. If youth were taken to the hospital by\npolice, staff always followed. Youth were transported to the\nhospital when they were self-harming. Some youth took\nadvantage of this and would act out to try to go to the hospital.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/24.\nStaff 4 stated she often asked youth what types of activities they\nwould like to participate in. Typically, the youth would ask to color,\nplay games, build Legos, watch movies, go to the gym for\nbasketball or to make up cheers. A group called Heart Warmers\nalso came in to do organized activities with youth, such as\nmusic/dance therapy and prayer groups. Most youth participated\nin activities. However, some chose not to. Staff 4 stated they had\nnot experienced the police coming to the facility. However, it was\ntheir understanding that a supervisor must decide when the police\nneeded to be contacted. If police transported youth to the hospital,\nstaff were required to stay at the hospital with the youth. Prior to\ncalling the police, staff would talk with youth about any issues and\ntry to understand what the problem was, then problem solve\nbefore contacting a supervisor. Sometimes talking helped and\nsometimes youth wanted to be alone. Staff 4 stated youth would\nbe taken to the hospital if they were injured, swallowed something\nthey should not have, or self-harmed another way.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/24.\nStaff 5 reported youth attended school and therapy every day.\nYouth participated in reflection groups a few times a week.

Activities included arts/crafts, bingo,\ntrivia, and group activities that were provided by an outside group.\nStaff 5 has not had any interactions with the police. However, Staff\n5’s understanding was that if youth were irate or suicidal and staff\ninterventions have not been successful, then a team leader or\n6",
    "supervisor would be contacted. The supervisor would then make\nthe decision to call the police. Staff 5 was not present for any\nyouth that were taken to the hospital. However, Staff 5 was aware\nthat youth would be taken to the hospital by police if they were\nsuicidal or had injuries.\nChief Administrator contacted DCWL via email on 12/20/24,\noutlining activities planned for youth during their holiday break\nfrom school.

On 1/21/25 Rights Officer\nclarified via email that JTS was a program within Vista Maria that\norganized events such as groups and dances, where instructors\nwere brought to campus. Recently they had a hair show and a\nfamily movie day for the youth. Dream Realized through\nEducation/Empowerment and Mentoring (DREAM) was a group\nthat was part of JTS that also offers group activities to youth on\ncampus. Heart Warmers was a spiritual group that youth could\nparticipate in on Sundays. Rights Officer confirmed that all of\nthese groups remain active on campus.\nQuality Manager was contacted via email on 1/23/25 regarding\nthe plans to revamp services on campus. Quality Manager\nreported there was a work group developed by the Activities &\nAcademic Support Manager. The work group was reviewing\ncurrent activities and creating new programming activities to\nengage the youth. Previously the facility contracted with outside\npartners for activities.

Youth would be able\nto bring any issues, concerns, wishes, requests to the group for\ndiscussion and decision making.\nActivities & Academic Support Manager (AASM) was contacted\nvia email on 1/23/25. AASM outlined the following items available\nto youth on campus: afterschool activities include but are not\nlimited to, expressive therapies such as yoga, dance movement\ntherapy, music therapy, art therapy, physical activity and\nnutritional health education. Academic mentoring and tutoring are\nsupported through the DREAM program as it connects each youth\n7",
    "with mentors who are successful in their career paths and provide\nsupports by focusing on their education and future career goals. In\naddition, the activity team provides programing that creates a safe\nenvironment to strengthen coping skills, promote social\nconnections, and support healthy self-esteem and confidence\nthrough creative self-care strategies.

Regarding police and hospital services,\nyouth were sent to the hospital when there was a suicide attempt\nor AWOL.

The police may be called to safely escort youth to the\nhospital upon approval by the clinical supervisor and director.\nTherapist 1 noted the facility was also working with Wayne County\nCMH, as they could come on site to complete assessments for\nyouth, rather than sending the youth to the hospital.\nTherapist 2 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 2\nwas assigned to Youth B and Youth C. Therapist 2 stated they\nrecently began working with these youth as their previous\ntherapist left the facility. Therapist 2 reported youth participated in\ntherapy 1-2 times per week, depending on their program.

While on\ntheir unit youth were able to play games, participate in art, watch\ntelevision, and participate in groups. Therapist 2 stated Youth B\nand Youth C attended therapy regularly. Although they always\nengaged, Therapist 2 was still assessing them as they had only\nworked together for a few weeks. Regarding police or hospital\ninvolvement, their services may be needed if a youth was highly\nescalated to an extent that it was a safety concern, and they are\nunable to regulate themselves or be deescalated. Sometimes\nphysical intervention could be used, but that was not always safe,\nespecially with a youth that was self-harming or physically\n8",
    "aggressive. The unit manager, clinical director or head consulting\npsychiatrist would make the determination if youth should be sent\nto the hospital. Therapist 2 stated the facility began working with\nWayne County Community Mental Health to complete\nassessments at the facility rather than visiting the hospital.\nTherapist 2 has not had any experience with this service at this\ntime.\nTherapist 3 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 3\nreported youth are offered activities such as games, art, gym,\ndance class, and cooking class. Therapist 3 stated youth may feel\nthat they are not doing as many activities lately, but this is due to\nsome programs being revamped. Also, some activities may be\nrestricted if the youth is physically aggressive. For example,\ninstead of using colored pencils that may be sharp, a youth could\nbe given crayons to draw. Youth also attend individual and family\ntherapy, and occupational therapy. In therapy they work on\ntriggers and warning signs, coping skills, thinking/feeling, and\ndiscussing problem solving. Regarding hospitalization and police\ncontact, Therapist 3 reported youth may be escorted to the\nhospital by police if they had continued escalated physical\naggression, self-harming, or suicidal behavior that staff were\nunable to reduce after multiple attempts to help the youth self-\nregulate. The clinical supervisor and clinical director would make\nthe determination if assistance was to be called. Therapist 3 also\nreported the facility has begun a partnership with Wayne County\nCMH, where CMH staff would complete on-site assessments to\ndetermine if a youth was eligible for short term hospitalization.\nTherapist 4 was interviewed by phone on 1/24/25. Therapist 4\nstated youth on campus participate in individual therapy, group\nwork, JTS activities, DREAM program, Alcoholics Anonymous and\nNarcotics Anonymous, structured activities with volunteer groups,\noccupational therapy, religious services, and receive support from\nyouth counselors. JTS has pro-social life skills, games, yoga,\ndance, sports and art. DREAM provides life skills, vocational\ntraining, exercise and mentorship. On the unit, youth were able to\nparticipate in art, games, movies, crafts, activities in the courtyard,\nand go on outings in the community. These activities could be\nmodified at times, due to youth behavioral or safety issues.\nTherapist 4 stated youth receive at least one hour of therapy per\nweek, which may be broken up into smaller sessions, depending\non the youth. Regarding police or hospital involvement, Therapist\n4 stated police have been called to campus if youth had violent\nbehaviors and attacked staff or peers. Police would not be called\nuntil after staff had made several efforts to deescalate the youth. A\n9",
    "supervisor, clinical director and the psychiatrist would determine\nwhen police would be called to campus. Generally, this decision\nwas made when a youth needed to be evaluated, but staff did not\nfeel they could safely transport the youth. Therapist 4 stated she\nhad some experience with the new process of having Wayne\nCounty Community Mental Health complete an assessment on-\nsite, in lieu of going to the hospital. The assessment was well\ndone and determined the youth needed inpatient hospitalization.\nHowever, there was not a placement available.

Both youth were sent to\nthe hospital in accordance with agency policy and there was no\nindication youth were not provided with services.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Recreational activities, equipment, and supplies; swimming\nTitle restriction.\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4136\nSection (2) Residents shall be provided a variety of indoor and outdoor\nDescription recreational activities designed to meet the residents’ needs.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Agency is not providing sufficient activities for youth.\nInvestigation During interviews, youth and staff reported there were several\nactivities available to youth in the program. However, Youth A,\nYouth B, Youth C, Youth D, and Youth F reported that activities\ndid not always occur. Youth indicated there was increased acting\nout behavior when activities did not occur, or when youth were\n13",
    "placed on wing restriction from activities. Youth reported concerns\nthat the agency’s behavior management/reward system was not\neffective. Youth reported concerns that staff spent too much time\ndeescalating certain youth and therefore not completing activities\nwith other youth.\nDuring interviews Youth B and Youth D reported they do not\nhave opportunities to participate in outdoor activities.\nActivities & Academic Support Manager provided\ndocumentation of several indoor activities made available for\nyouth. However, no outdoor activities were identified.\nDuring a call on 2/6/25, Chief Administrator and Quality\nManager reported that youth participate in outdoor activity when\nthe weather permits. However, they were unsure if there was a\nschedule of outdoor activities. They were asked to provide\ndocumentation to show that youth were participating in outdoor\nactivity on a regular basis. In subsequent emails on 2/10/25 and\n2/14/25, Quality Manager reported they did not have any\ndocumentation to verify this request.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nWeekly and monthly unit schedules were reviewed that had\nschedule activities documented such as daily group, daily phone\ncalls, therapy, physical activity, JTS, “Chicktime” with volunteer\ngroup, Vista Maria reads (Book Ladies), Lost Voices Concert,\ntown hall meeting, Boots & Bites with Lace Up Detroit, Pet\nTherapy, holiday events with Abhi Shah Foundation, holiday\ndecorating, and youth health fair.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as youth reported being\nunable to participate in activities due to peer behavior, or not\nhaving any activities available to them while on wing restriction.\nYouth also reported they are not able to engage in outdoor activity\nand the agency did not have any documentation to verify outdoor\nactivities occur with youth.\nCONSULTATION:\nConsultation was offered regarding youth behavior on units that\ndisrupt the daily activities. When disruptive behavior is ongoing\nand prohibiting other youth from their daily activities, efforts should\nbe made to continue activities with youth in another area, away\nfrom the disruption. Not only would this be a positive step for the\nother youth, but it would also take away the acting out youth’s\npower to control the daily activity of the unit. Additionally, for youth\n14",
    "placed on restriction that are missing activities, staff should\ncontinue to focus on encouraging the youth to reduce behaviors in\norder to re-join the group. This may help alleviate the youth’s\nfeeling that wing restriction is never ending. Lastly, inclusion of\nideas from some restricted youth in the client advisory board\nwould be a great way to determine some activities that restricted\nyouth may be interested in, to help them increase engagement in\nthe program.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n_ ___________February 18, 2025__________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 19, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n15"
