METHODOLOGY\n10/08/2014 Enrollment\n10/08/2014 BCAL Inspection On Site – Two Consultants – Full Compliance\n10/09/2014 Environmental Health Inspection – A Rating – Adam Rose\nMuskegon County Public Health\n10/10/2014 LARA Final Fire Inspection Approval – Duane Dimet\nIII. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThis is a newly constructed, 32 bed, secure juvenile detention facility. It is divided\ninto four pods – each able to accommodate eight youth. Each pod consists of two\nsingle rooms and three double rooms. Each room has an attached bathroom. Each\nof the pods is able to accommodate a co-ed population, as census varies. Each\nroom has the ability to provide seclusion for one youth and is audio and video\nmonitored.\nThe facility also has an intake and mental health assessment area, medical/dental\narea, a family services and visitation area, three classrooms and a computer lab, two\ngymnasiums, a courtyard and outdoor recreation area, and two flexible living areas\nthat confine up to sixteen residents to a four room daytime living area.\nThere is good visibility between areas that allows staff to view not only their own pod\ngroup, but to observe other pod groups to insure orderly operation throughout the\nfacility. All doors in the facility are electronic, with staff carrying key fobs to open\ndoors. The four exterior doors in the facility are not controlled by these fobs. A shift\nsupervisor area allows all pods to be observed simultaneously via cameras. Exterior\ndoors are controlled by the shift supervisor.\nAn Environmental Health Inspection on 10/9/2014 resulted in an “A” rating, as did\nthe Fire Safety Inspection conducted on 10/16/2014.\nB. Program Description\nThe milieu of the facility utilizes policies and procedures from the old Transition\nCenter Facility, with very little change. Additionally, the teaching staff from the old\nfacility will continue to teach at the new facility. Program enhancements include\nincreased CMH supported assessments and treatment, more treatment resources\nand group therapy, and increased partnering not only with Muskegon CMH, but also\nthe Intermediate School District, the juvenile court, and parents.\n2",
    "Food is prepared off site and transported to the facility in food warmers. Currently\nthe facility contracts with Canteen Food Service. Laundry Services will be provided\nby the Muskegon County Jail.\nThe programming offered at the Transition Center will continue to be the Guided\nGroup Interaction (GGI) model. GGI Programming is offered to all residents and\nconsist s of group and individual skill development activities. General Guided Group\nInteraction involves residents being taught to offer help and advice to each other\nwhen a resident is showing inappropriate behaviors. Group assistance meetings are\ncalled by staff when the informal resident assistance and advice does not resolve an\nissue. Residents are also assessed to determine individual needs to be addressed\nthrough four supplemental programming tracks [Mental Health, Building Respect for\nSelf & Others, Pre-Placement Preparation, and Community Living Preparation].\nThe Mental Health track will offer programming to youth diagnosed with significant\nmental illnesses such as Depressive Illnesses, Reactive Attachment Disorder,\nAnxiety Disorders, and Psychotic Illnesses. Programming will focus on mental health\neducation, coping with mental health symptoms, self-awareness skills, and building\nhealthy coping and relationship skills.\nThe Respect for Self & Others track will offer programming to youth exhibiting anti-\nsocial and criminal behaviors. Programming will focus on the development of\nempathy for others, self-awareness skills, victim impact awareness, giving of\nyourself to others; repairing damaged relationships, and living productively in\ncommunity with others.\nThe Pre-Placement Preparation track will offer programming to youth preparing to\ntransfer to a residential placement in another facility. Programming will focus on the\ndevelopment of age appropriate relationship/social/life skills, setting life-long goals,\nlearning what their pending placement will be like, feelings identification, and\ndeveloping coping skills.\nThe Community Living Preparation track will offer programming to youth preparing to\nreturn to the local community. Programming will focus on the development of age\nappropriate relationship/social/life skills, setting goals, development of a relapse\nprevention plan, development of an emergency/danger response plan, development\nof a community/family support plan.\n3",
    "C. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe facility is in compliance with all licensing statutes and rules.\nConsultation was offered by both consultants who inspected the facility. The\nconsultation related to the staffing ratio and a reasonable back up plan for staffing.\nThe current staffing ratio is 1:8 during awake hours and 1:11 while residents sleep.\nThe shift supervisor acting as back up to the four pods. While a variety of support\nstaff, administration, education staff, and CMH staff are present during the day; the\nshift supervisor is the fifth staff in the facility and the only back up to one staff\nworking in each of the four pods after 5PM. This staffing configuration could be less\nthan safe for staff and residents because when the shift supervisor acts as a back up\nstaff during a crisis in one pod, or even relieves a staff for a break, no one monitors\ncameras, is able to access outside doors, or provides support to the individual staff\nsupervising the other three pods. As the new facility expands from 22 beds to 32\nbeds, the potential for behavioral outbursts increases. As 22 or less residents will be\ntransferred to the new facility, it was recommended that staffing and backup\nsupports be reviewed prior to the facility reaching its full capacity.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that the seclusion rooms in this facility be approved and that this\nsecure child caring institution be issued a provisional license.\n10/16/2014\nSteve Ragsdale Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/20/2014\nGregory V. Corrigan Date\nArea Manager\n4"
