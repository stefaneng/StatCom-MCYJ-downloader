    "maltreatment during this licensing period.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe requirements of the CA assessment were discussed, and the facility understands\nthe process. Because the original study was just completed six months ago, and the\nrequirement is for an annual assessment the assessment had not been completed.\nThe facility has had no incidents and the Chief Administrator had nothing to report for\nthe assessment.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted with the staff present (License Designee) and the one\nyouth who was verbal. The youth interviewed was able to respond with single word\n“yes”. He indicated feeling safe and liking his placement at the facility. He appeared\nwell kept and healthy. His room was viewed, and it was in very good condition. The\nsecond youth’s room was observed, and it also was well kept. Both rooms had all of\nthe required items present. The second youth had just entered the program on\n12/1/2021. The staff reported the are receiving referrals and it appears the referrals\nare for youth within the autism spectrum. Staff also reported providing the necessary\ncare for the needs of the youth in the program.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n12/17/2021\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 17, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
