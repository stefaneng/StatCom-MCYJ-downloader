    "8/15/2023 10:00 AM Video Conference Consultation Provided; Pre-Exit\nConference\nIII. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 7/14/23 youth was brought to the hospital due to an allergic\nreaction to a bee sting. While there, youth was also flagged as a\nhigh suicide risk and was expected to complete an evaluation with\na social worker. Youth was being kept under observation after\nbeing administered epinephrine and was on suicide watch. Youth\nbecame agitated and requested to leave. Staff agreed to let youth\nleave against medical advice and without a safety plan. Youth was\nnot monitored the full recommended time after an allergic reaction.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Hospital Social Worker was interviewed via\nvideo conference on 7/24/23 in conjunction with MDHHS\nWorker. Complainant reported she did not meet or have any\ninteractions with Youth A and Staff 1 on 7/14/23. Complainant\nreported she received the allegations second-hand from the\nmedical team treating Youth A. Complainant stated the medical\nteam reported concerns Youth A left with Staff 1. However,\nComplainant reported the team’s biggest concern was Youth A left\nwithout Complainant being able to complete the suicide\nassessment, which was required based on Youth A’s suicide\nintake rating tool completed upon admission to the emergency\nroom.\nHospital Nurse was interviewed via phone on 8/14/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Hospital Nurse reported she\nworked directly with Youth A at the hospital on 7/14/23. Hospital\nNurse reported Youth A came into the emergency room due to a\nbee sting she had received and an Epi-pen she administered on\nherself. Before Staff 1 came into the emergency room, Hospital\nNurse completed the suicide intake tool for Youth A and Youth A\nflagged high risk due to her history, not due to current suicidal\nideations. Hospital Nurse had a hospital sitter sit outside of Youth\nA’s room as that is standard protocol for patients with suicide risk.\nHospital Nurse reported she then went to speak to the doctor to\ndetermine if there was a need to get a hospital social worker\n2",
    "involved. Hospital Nurse reported there was not a decision made\nduring the conversation with the doctor. Hospital Nurse reported\nshe should have entered an order into the computer system to flag\na social worker to complete a suicide assessment based on the\nrating tool completed. However, since the doctor did not decide\nwhether social work should be involved, Hospital Nurse forgot to\nenter the order. Since the order was not entered, a suicide\nassessment request was never officially requested or completed,\nso no one spoke to Staff 1 about the requirement for an\nassessment prior to Youth A leaving the hospital. Hospital Nurse\nreported Youth A was irritated and anxious and did not want to\nstay in the hospital for the two-hour monitoring period. Hospital\nNurse reported Staff 1 was sitting in the room, was not saying\nanything to Youth A and was just allowing Youth A to become\nmore agitated while sitting in the room. When Hospital Nurse was\nout of Youth A’s room, she received a message from the hospital\nsitter stating Youth A and Staff 1 were walking out of the room and\nleaving the hospital. Hospital Nurse reported she stopped Youth A\nand Staff 1 and explained Youth A’s care was not done because\nthey needed to monitor her for a certain amount of time to ensure\nshe did not have any reactions from the bee sting or Epi-pen\nadministration. Hospital Nurse reported Youth A was very anxious\nand did not want to stay anymore, so Hospital Nurse told Staff 1\nshe needed to get the doctor to discharge Youth A before they\nleft. Hospital Nurse reported Staff 1 and Youth A sat in the waiting\nroom. Hospital Nurse stated she spoke with the doctor, and they\nboth felt comfortable discharging Youth A because she was\nalmost there for the required two hours. Hospital Nurse reported\nYouth A was not on a behavioral health hold and was not required\nto complete a suicide assessment prior to leaving because an\norder for the assessment was never completed. Hospital Nurse\nreported the doctor was comfortable with Youth A being\ndischarged, which is why the discharge paperwork was completed\nand did not state it was a discharge against medical advice.\nHospital Nurse reported she was not aware a complaint was being\nmade or MDHHS would be involved because there were not\nconcerns with Youth A leaving.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/18/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported on\n7/14/23, she was stung by a bee while she and other youth were\nwith facility staff at a local park. Youth A reported she is allergic to\nbees and when she gets stung, it’s hard to breathe. Youth A\nreported when she gets stung, she uses an Epi-pen and can\nadminister it herself. Then she is supposed to ask staff to call 911\nor she will call 911 and notify staff if she is not present with staff.\n3",
    "Youth A reported she then must go to the hospital, and they must\nmonitor her for two hours. Youth A reported she has gotten stung\nby a bee an unknown number of times since being at the facility,\nalthough not all the bee stings have occurred on the facility’s\ncampus. After the bee sting on 7/14/23, Youth A reported she\nadministered her Epi-pen, Staff 2 called 911 and then an\nambulance took Youth A to the hospital. Youth A reported on\n7/14/23, she did not want to be in the hospital because she was\nstressed. Youth A reported she was feeling really depressed and\nall the cords in the hospital room were making her want to hang\nherself. Youth A reported she asked to speak to the doctor twice\nbecause she wanted to be discharged, but the doctor did not\ncome talk to her. Youth A reported she told Hospital Nurse and\nother hospital staff she wanted to leave and wanted to speak to\nthe doctor. Youth A reported Staff 1 was sitting in the hospital\nroom with her, and she told Staff 1 how she was feeling. Staff 1\nagreed to try and get the doctor into the room. Youth A reported\nafter she told Staff 1 how she was feeling, Youth A pulled out her\nIV, got dressed and started walking out of the room. When Youth\nA started getting dressed, Youth A said Staff 1 tried to get her to\nstay and said, “please don’t do this; it’s not worth it”. Youth A\nreported she didn’t want to be there, so she didn’t listen to Staff 1.\nYouth A reported they walked into the lobby and Hospital Nurse\ncame out to talk to them. Youth A reported Hospital Nurse said,\n“we are going to have to make a complaint because it’s child\nneglect to leave the hospital before she’s fully discharged”. Youth\nA reported she did not remember what Staff 1 did or said when\nHospital Nurse gave that information. Hospital Nurse went back\ninto the hospital and when she came back out, Staff 1 and Youth\nA went back to the facility.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/18/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported she was\nnot present on 7/14/23 when Youth A got stung by the bee but\nwas asked to go to the hospital to sit with her. Staff 1 reported she\nwent to the park and followed the ambulance to the hospital. Upon\narriving to the hospital, Staff 1 reported she went into the room\nwith Youth A and there were medical staff talking to Youth A. The\nmedical staff stated they were going to give Youth A an IV,\nBenadryl, steroids, and another medication (Staff 1 couldn’t\nremember), and then they were going to monitor her for two\nhours. Hospital Nurse told Staff 1 and Youth A there was going to\nbe a hospital sitter sitting outside of the room as a precaution due\nto Youth A’s suicidal history. After a while, Youth A told Staff 1 she\ncouldn’t sit in the room for much longer because sitting in the\nroom for so long with nothing to do is what leads to her suicidal\n4",
    "thoughts. Hospital Nurse came in and checked on Youth A, and\nYouth A asked to speak to the doctor because she wanted to\nleave. Staff 1 reported Hospital Nurse stated the doctor was busy,\nstated they would give him the message, but Youth A refused, so\nthe nurses told Youth A she only needed to be there for two hours\nand didn’t have much time left. Shortly after Hospital Nurse left,\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was sitting on her bed taking her IV out of\nher arm. Staff 1 asked what Youth A what was she doing, and\nYouth A reported she was removing the cords because she\nwanted to leave because her suicidal thoughts were increasing\nfrom sitting in the room doing nothing with all the cords around.\nYouth A proceeded to put her shoes and shirt on and walk out of\nthe room. Staff 1 reported she felt she couldn’t physically force\nYouth A to stay, so her priority was to follow Youth A to ensure her\nsafety, because that’s what they’re taught when youth at the\nfacility go AWOL. Staff 1 reported as she was following Youth A,\nshe asked Youth A to sit down in the waiting room and wait so she\ncould call Supervisor. Staff 1 reported she and Youth A both\ntalked to Supervisor. As Staff 1 was on the phone with Supervisor,\nHospital Nurse came up to them and asked if they were leaving, to\nwhich Staff 1 replied “yes, if she wants to leave, I cannot stop her”.\nStaff 1 reported Hospital Nurse said, “you’ll have to sign\nsomething because Youth A’s not discharged yet”. Staff 1 got\nback on the phone with Supervisor and updated her regarding\nwhat Hospital Nurse said. Supervisor told Staff 1 she would call\nher back after talking to Administrator. Supervisor called back a\ncouple minutes later and told Staff 1 she couldn’t get a hold of\nAdministrator but instructed Staff 1 not to sign anything. Then\nHospital Nurse came out with discharge paperwork and did not\nask her to sign anything. Staff 1 reported Hospital Nurse told Staff\n1 to keep an eye on Youth A and if anything changes with Youth\nA's breathing, bring her right back in. Staff 1 reported Hospital\nNurse never said she was going to make a complaint and did not\nreport any concerns with Youth A and Staff 1 leaving when she\nbrought the discharge paperwork to them. Staff 1 reported none of\nthe hospital staff ever talked to her about Youth A receiving a high\nscore on the suicidal screening tool or that a suicidal assessment\nwas required. Staff 1 reported the only thing she feels she could\nhave done better or differently in the situation was using more de-\nescalation tools to ease Youth A’s anxiety or take Youth A’s mind\noff things sooner, but she felt she didn’t have time to do it.\nAdministrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n7/18/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Administrator\nreported he was called by Supervisor after Youth A had pulled out\nher IV, was attempting to leave the hospital and the hospital staff\n5",
    "had asked Staff 1 to sign paperwork. Administrator reported he\ntold Supervisor, Staff 1 was not allowed to sign medical release\nforms because staff are not medically trained to assess what is\nhappening or what should happen. Administrator reported\nSupervisor told him Staff 1 did not sign anything and they were\njust in the entryway of the hospital waiting for discharge\npaperwork. Administrator called Supervisor approximately ten\nminutes later and Supervisor reported Staff 1 and Youth A were\nheading back to the facility. Administrator reported today (7/18/23)\nhe received a call from the Hospital Clinical Supervisor regarding\nher concerns with the situation. Hospital Clinical Supervisor told\nAdministrator she did not like the interactions Hospital Nurse had\nwith Staff 1, but reported she was only relaying second-hand\ninformation from other hospital staff and was not present for the\ninteraction. Hospital Clinical Supervisor told Administrator, Staff 1\nwas dismissive to Youth A’s care and she feels Staff 1 could have\ndone more to be supportive of the medical team’s\nopinion/direction and redirect Youth A to convince her to stay.\nSupervisor was interviewed via phone on 7/24/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor reported Staff 2\nwas with three youth at a local park. Staff 2 called Supervisor and\nsaid Youth A was stung by a bee and someone needed to meet\nher at the hospital. Supervisor said Staff 1 was assigned to go to\nthe hospital and sit with Youth A. Approximately two hours after\nYouth A and Staff 1 were at the hospital, Staff 1 reached out to\nSupervisor and stated Youth A took out her IV and was walking\nout of the hospital. Staff 1 told Supervisor someone from the\nhospital was trying to get her to sign something approving Youth A\nto leave the hospital against medical advice. Supervisor stated\nshe told Staff 1 not to sign anything and she would call\nAdministrator for further direction. Supervisor reported she talked\nto Youth A on the phone after she spoke with Staff 1. Supervisor\nreported she tried to process Youth A's reasons for wanting to\nleave the hospital and tried to convince her to stay. Youth A told\nSupervisor when she was stuck in the hospital room with nothing\nto keep her busy, she began having suicidal ideations and she\nwas adamant she was not going to stay at the hospital. Supervisor\nstated she tried to help Youth A understand why the hospital was\nasking them to stay and the importance of them monitoring her,\nbut Youth A made it clear she was not going to stay at the\nhospital, and she felt fine. Supervisor reported after her\nconversation with Youth A, she attempted to call Administrator,\nbut she had to leave a voicemail. Supervisor reported she then\ncalled Staff 1 back to update her and Staff 1 told Supervisor the\nhospital was discharging Youth A instead of having them sign\n6",
    "something. Supervisor reported she had no knowledge of Youth A\nscoring high for suicide risk at the hospital because Staff 1 did not\ntell her that information and it wasn’t mentioned on any of the\nhospital discharge paperwork.
