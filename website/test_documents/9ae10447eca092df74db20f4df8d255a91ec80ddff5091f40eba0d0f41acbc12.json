    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Medical, dental and mental health care\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12507\nSection • (1) An agency shall ensure that a youth in independent\nDescription living receives any needed medical, dental, and mental\nhealth care as required in R 400.12413. Medical, dental,\nand mental health care provided must be documented in\nthe youth's record.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 10/18/24, there was an incident at school which required youth\nto go to the hospital. No staff could be reached, and the school\naccompanied the youth. Staff arrived two hours later. Youth was\nsupposed to have the staples removed within 5 days and staff did\nnot comply with this even though they were aware. Youth\ncurrently still has the staples in their head even though they\nshould have been removed by 10/25/24.\nYouth is prescribed medication for various diagnosis's and there\nhave been multiple occasions where medication was delayed by a\nday or more.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nAll interviews were completed along with DHHS Worker.\nYouth A was interviewed in person at the Independent Living\nhome in which he lives on 10/30/2024. Youth A reported being\nshoved into a wall at school during an argument with a peer on\n10/18/2024. Youth A reported school staff attempted to contact\nFoster Care Worker 1, but they were unable to reach her, so they\ncalled an ambulance. Since Youth A is a minor, an adult had to\naccompany him in the ambulance, so someone from the school\nrode with Youth A. Youth A stated he was at the emergency room\nfor approximately 30-minutes before Foster Care Worker 2,\narrived at the hospital. Youth A reported receiving 4 staples in has\nhead after which he was given ibuprofen. He stated the doctor told\nhim to either come back to the emergency room or go to any\ndoctor or urgent care to have the staples removed after 5 days.\nYouth A reported not having been given any discharge paperwork,\nnor seeing anyone else get the paperwork.\n2",
    "Youth A reported youth are not allowed to make their own medical\nappointments and must be transported by staff to those\nappointments. Youth A reported being taken to urgent care by\nFoster Care Worker 1 on10/22/2024 due to Youth A having\ndifficulty breathing for which Youth A was given antibiotics. The\nfollowing day, Youth A contacted Foster Care Worker 1 to let her\nknow it had been 5 days since the staples were administered, so it\nwas time to have them removed. Foster Care Worker 1 told Youth\nA she was off work that day but would make an appointment for\nYouth A to have the staples removed. Foster Care Worker 1 told\nYouth A she tried to call him back about an appointment, but\nYouth A was asleep. Youth A didn’t remember this, but stated he\nwas sick, so it was possible. He stated he was worried about the\nstaples being in his head to long. Seven days later, Youth A was\ntold by staff at the home where he is living to not go to school and\nto go to Foster Care Worker 1’s office. Foster Care Worker 1 told\nYouth A he had an appointment to get the staples removed, which\nwas the first time Youth A was told of the appointment. The doctor\nwho removed the staples stated the wound was healing well and\neverything looked good.\nYouth A also expressed concern with his medication\nadministration. He reported he takes 3 medications, which are\ncomprised of 6 pills per day. He stated there have been three\noccasions since he came to the independent living home in which\nhe was completely out of at least one of his medications. Youth A\nstated his medication is stored in a medication room at the home\nand his pills are popped from a bubble pack into a paper cup by\nstaff, so he has no way of knowing how many pills are left. He\nstated on 10/27/2024, he was only given one of his medications\nand was told he had run out of the other two. He reported only\nbeing given that one medication on the 27th and 28th but receiving\nall three again on the 29th. Youth A stated he was feeling\nimpulsive, emotional, and tingly and that his OCD symptoms\nworsened while he was out of his medication. Youth A stated the\nprevious two times he ran out of medications it was only one\nmedication and only for one day each time.\nDirector 1, who is the director of all transitional living programs at\nthe agency was interviewed in person on 10/30/2204. He reported\non the day Youth A was injured at school, Foster Care Worker 1\nwas in a court hearing, so Foster Care Worker 2 went to the\nhospital to be with Youth A. He reported Director 2 supervises the\nfoster care workers, so she would have additional information\nabout that incident.\n3",
    "Director 1 stated there have been three times Youth A has not had\nall of his medication. He reported the agency uses a system called\n“Pharma Script” that ensures medications are refilled and\ndelivered automatically. When Youth A’s medication was out on\nSunday, Pharma Script was closed and could not be contacted\nand when they were contacted the following Monday, they\napologized. He stated the previous times Youth A ran out of\nmedication it was because Youth A received the text notifications\nabout the refills, so the staff were not aware. He stated this has\nonly ever happened to Youth A and they are now going to gauge if\nmedications are getting low so they can avoid this happening\nagain.\nDirector 2 who is the director of foster care services was\ninterviewed in person on 10/30/2024. She reported being\ncontacted on 10/18/2024 and informed of the incident at school\nwith Youth A, but did not recall who contacted her. She stated\nFoster Care Worker 1 was in court, so she contacted Foster Care\nWorker 2 to fill in at the hospital with Youth A. Director 2 stated\nFoster Care Worker 2 kept in contact with her to let her know what\nwas going on and that Youth A got 4 staples in his head. Foster\nCare Worker 2 was given Youth A’s discharge paperwork which\nwas then given to Director 2. She stated the paperwork only\nstated the staples needed to be removed, but there was no\ntimeframe in the paperwork. She stated she was told verbally the\nstaples had to be removed after approximately a week by Foster\nCare Worker 2. Director 2 stated it came to her attention this week\nthat Youth A wanted the staples out ASAP, so she spoke to Foster\nCare Worker 1 who was in the process of making an appointment.\nDirector 2 reported she does not know how specifically the staff at\nthe agency became aware of Youth A’s concern about the staples\nnor did she know why it took so long for the staples to get\nremoved, but she knows they were removed yesterday.\nDirector 2 reported each youth’s assigned foster care worker\ntakes them to their medical appointments. A computer system\nkeeps track of the medications and automatically refills and\ndelivers when they are low. Staff and supervisors of the home are\nresponsible for checking medications to ensure they do not run\nout. The staff will typically let foster care workers know if the\nmedications are running low.\nFoster Care Worker 1 was interviewed in person on 10/30/2024.\nShe reported she was in court on 10/18/2024 after which she\nreceived a call from Foster Care Worker 2 with photos of the\nstaples in Youth A’s head. She stated she was not given the\n4",
    "discharge paperwork initially but when eventually provided with\nthem, she saw there was no specific timeframe in which to bring\nYouth A to have the staples removed. She reported Youth A never\ngave her a timeframe either. She stated she made a “judgment”\nthat the staples should be removed in 7-10 days. Foster Care\nWorker 1 stated it is her responsibility to make medical\nappointments for the youths and to make sure they get their\nmedical care. She stated she called the hospital on 10/25/2024 to\nask if the staples needed to be removed by the hospital, but was\ntold it could be done by any doctor. She did not ask if there was\ntimeframe in which they should be removed. She stated she\nbrought Youth A to urgent care on 10/22/2024 because he was\nsick. That doctor looked at the staples while he was there and said\nthe injury was healing well. She stated she did not ask that doctor\nwhen the staples should be removed as she felt Youth A’s illness\nwas more important at that point. She reported, in her personal\nexperience as a previous Certified Nursing Assistant as well as\nwith her own family, the staples should be removed in 7-10 days,\nso she planned to make an appointment with Youth A's primary\nmedical provider within that timeframe. She stated she told Youth\nA on 10/22/2024 not to worry because she would make an\nappointment for the staples to be removed. She reported having\nmade an appointment on 10/25/2024 after which the staples were\nremoved 10/29/2024. The doctor who removed the staples stated\nthe incision looked good and there were no concerns. She denied\nmaking the appointment as a result of the complaint resulting in\nthis allegation.\nRegarding Youth A’s medication, Foster Care Worker 1 reported\nshe brings youths to their psychiatrist appointments and the doctor\nwill call in prescriptions to the pharmacy. The pharmacy delivers\nthe medications to the agency. If medications do not arrive, Foster\nCare Worker 1 will call the doctor and pharmacy. She stated\nYouth A’s last medication review was on 10/8/2024 after which all\nhis medications were called in, but she believed the pharmacy did\nnot fill all of the medications because he ran out. She stated Youth\nA did not call her about his missing medication, but someone\ncalled her on Monday to let her know Youth A was out of his\nmedications. She stated Youth A had missed medication in the\npast because they were sent to the wrong pharmacy and the only\nperson who received the notification was Youth A.\nIndependent living Plus Supervisor was interviewed in person\non 10/30/2024. She reported receiving a call from Youth A’s\nschool on 10/18/2024 about the incident with Youth A and a peer.\nShe stated she was told he needed stitches, and someone had to\n5",
    "ride to the hospital with him in an ambulance. Independent Living\nPlus Supervisor contacted Foster Care Worker 2 because Foster\nCare Worker 1 was in court. Foster Care Worker 2 was out with\nsome of the youths in the community, so he was going to contact\nhis supervisor. When Youth A returned to the home, Independent\nLiving Plus Supervisor viewed his discharge paperwork which\nindicated to keep the wound clean. She did not see anything on\nthe paperwork about a timeframe for the staples to be removed.\nIndependent Living Plus Supervisor reported youth medication\ndistribution is documented in a computer system. The system\ndoesn’t notify staff if medications are running out. If the staff notice\nsomething is getting low, they should contact Independent Living\nPlus Supervisor. No one told Independent Living Plus Supervisor\nYouth A’s medications were getting low. She stated this was an\noversight and Independent Living Plus Supervisor’s responsibility.\nShe stated, moving forward, midnight staff will check medications\nand call the assigned foster care worker if a youth has 5 pills or\nless. Additionally, Independent Living Plus Supervisor will check\nthe medications weekly to ensure they do not run out.\nFoster Care Worker 2 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n11/15/2024. He reported he was transporting a youth from an\nappointment when Independent Living Plus Supervisor called him\nand said Youth A was going to the hospital for a head injury and\nFoster Care Worker 1 was in court. Foster Care Worker 2 stated\nthere was some confusion because the school had indicated they\nwould wait for Foster Care Worker 2 to arrive before leaving with\nYouth A then Independent Living Plus Supervisor called back and\nsaid Youth A was already on the way to the hospital. Foster Care\nWorker 2 dropped off the youth he was transporting then went to\nthe hospital where he met Youth A and a school staff member.\nFoster Care Worker 2 stated he stayed with Youth A while the\nstaples were administered and the doctor said to bring Youth A in\nto have the staples removed in a week. Foster Care Worker 2\nstated he believed a week to mean 7 days. He stated the doctor\nnever specified a 5-day timeframe and he is unsure where that\ntimeframe came from. Foster Care Worker stated he remained in\ntouch with Director 2 while at the hospital but doesn’t remember if\nhe told her when the staples needed to be removed.\nWhen Foster Care Worker 2 dropped Youth A off at the home, he\ntold Independent Living Plus Supervisor the staples needed to be\nremoved in about a week and that Youth A shouldn’t work. Foster\nCare Worker 2 stated Foster Care Worker 1 would have been\nresponsible for making the appointment for the staples to be\n6",
    "removed. Foster Care Worker 2 stated he is now Youth A’s\nassigned worker, but he does not know why there was a switch.\nFoster Care Worker 2 reported he has never experienced any\nissues with the youths on his caseload receiving their medications.\nDuring a conversation with MDHHS Worker via video\nconferencing on 11/15/2024, she reported speaking to the\nreceptionist at the medical facility where Youth A’s staples were\nremoved. The receptionist reported the appointment was not\nmade on 10/25/2024, rather it was made after 3:00PM on\n10/28/2024, 10 days after the staples were administered. The\nstaples were removed during the next available appointment,\nwhich was the following day, 10/29/2024. MDHHS Worker also\nspoke to the emergency room doctor who administered the\nstaples who reviewed his notes which stated the direction he gave\nto Youth A was to return to have the staples removed in 5 days.\nSchool Counselor was interviewed by phone on 12/17/2024.\nMDHHS Worker was not present for the interview. School\nCounselor reported being with Youth A at the hospital when the\nstaples were applied to his head injury. She was in the room with\nYouth A when the resident physician told Youth A to return to\nhave the staples removed in 4-5 days. School Counselor stated\nthe attending physician was not present when that instruction was\ngiven.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n- 10/18/2024 After visit summary documenting Youth A was\ndiagnosed with a head injury and scalp laceration and to\nfollow up for suture removal\n- 10/22/2024 Urgent care summary documenting Youth A\nwas treated for cough and chest congestion\n- The agency Transitional Living Program Handbook Medical\nPolicy which states the Foster Care Case Manager is\nresponsible for scheduling appointments, arranging for\ntransportation and assisting the youth in medical needs.\n- MDHHS Worker’s report documenting no findings.\nAnalysis The agency is found in violation of providing for needed medical\ncare of Youth A as Foster Care Worker 1 and Director 2 reported\nFoster Care Worker 1 is responsible for making all of Youth A’s\nmedical appointments and transporting Youth A to those\nappointments; however, Foster Care Worker 1 did not follow-up\nafter Youth A received staples in his head as to when the doctor\nrecommended the staples be removed, rather she reported having\nused her own judgment that the staples should be removed after\n7",
    "7-10 days. Foster Care Worker 1 did not make an appointment 5\ndays after the staples were administered when asked to do so by\nYouth A who informed Foster Care Worker 1, he was given this\ntimeframe by the doctor. Additionally, Foster Care Worker 2 and\nDirector 2 believed the staples were to be removed after a week.\nDespite all of these factors, the staples were removed after 11\ndays.\nThe agency is also found in violation as Youth A missed some of\nhis medication due to two of his medications running out. The\nagency requires all youths’ medication be stored in a locked\nmedication room and be administered by staff members;\ntherefore, it is the agency’s responsibility to ensure the youths do\nnot run out of their medication.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Eligibility requirements\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12504\nSection • (1) An agency shall document the rationale for selection of\nDescription independent living as the most appropriate placement for\nthe youth.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation During the course of this investigation, concerns related to the\nappropriateness of the youths for Independent Living placements\nwere raised related to the level of care and supervision needed.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nYouth A was interviewed on 10/30/2024 in person. During the\ninterview, Youth A reported the following:\n- Youth A believes youths were not allowed to be in the\nhome without staff, so they didn’t hurt themselves or others.\n- Youths must ask for sharps from staff, such as knives when\nprepping food.\n- There is a youth in the home with significant cognitive\ndelays.\n- There is a youth in the home who engages in coprophagia.\nDirector 1, who is the Director of all transitional living programs\nwas interviewed on 10/30/2024. Director 1 reported the following:\n8",
    "- Youths are not allowed to be in the home without a staff\nmember.\n- For safety reasons, the agency wants eyes on the youths at\nall times.\nDirector 1 stated the program was being operated under a child\ncaring institution license. During a meeting held 1/7/2025 via video\nconferencing, Methodist Children’s Home Society felt this\nstatement was misrepresented and asked it to be amended to\nclarify the interaction. Director 1 stated he meant the agency has a\nCCI license, but didn’t mean the ILP program was operated under\nthat license.\nDirector 2, who is the Director of all Foster Care, Independent\nLiving, and Unaccompanied Refugee Minor programs was\ninterviewed on 10/30/2024. Director 2 reported the following:\n- The ILP homes are staffed 24/7 and a staff must be in the\nhome with youths.\nA phone call was held with Senior Director of Child Welfare on\n11/1/2024. When informed there were concerns some of the\nyouths in the home might not be appropriate for an independent\nliving program as it sounds as if they need a level of care and\nsupervision provided by a child caring institution, she responded\nsome youths are referred to the program because they are leaving\nresidential and cannot go to a foster home or because there are\nno other placement options. She stated the youths they receive\nreferrals for Independent Living Plus are very different than the\nyouths they used to receive, and they come with higher needs.\nFoster Care Worker 2 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n11/15/2024. He reported he has eleven youths on his caseload,\nand they all have different needs and progress through the\nprogram at different levels. He stated the youths on his caseload\nall demonstrate the capability of living independently.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nThe following documents were reviewed for the youths living in the\nsame cottage as Youth A:\nMethodist Children’s Society Independent Living Plus Referral\nForms.
