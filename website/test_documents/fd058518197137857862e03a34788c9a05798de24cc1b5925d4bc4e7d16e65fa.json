CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• There was no consultation requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. Special evaluation 2024C0001172SE was initiated on 12/13/2023 regarding\nallegations a licensed foster parent hitting a youth. The licensed foster parent was\nfound to be in violation of licensing rules. The evaluation was thorough and well\nwritten. Revocation of the foster home license was initiated.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe agency interim inspection was completed on 12/15/2023 and the CAP was\napproved on 1/2/2024. The agency was cited for 17 violations, 3 of which were\nrepeated this year (late Updated Service Plans, placement outlines and missed\nface-to-face contact with youth in placement). Of those 3, there was an\nimprovement in individual incidents of non-compliance within 2 of the violation\nareas (placement outlines and late Updated Service Plans) and a slight increase\nin number of individual incidents in the other 1 area (missed face-to-face contact).\nIn 2023, 6 violations were established, none of which were repeated this year. The\nagency will need to establish additional corrective planning for the repeated\nviolations to ensure a reduction of incidents.\nSpecial Investigation 2024SIC0001518 was completed on 7/16/2024 and the CAP\nwas approved on 8/7/2024. The agency was found in non-compliance as the\nagency did not notify the parent of their child's replacement. The agency’s CAP\nincluded retraining staff, updating the replacement checklist, and additional\nsupervisory oversight. The agency is complied with the CAP action steps and no\nfurther concerns have been noted.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated that there have been difficulties throughout the year due to staff turnover\nthat caused multiple case transfers. The agency has added a Compliance\nCoordinator position which they feel has helped to improve oversight and\ncompliance. In addition, the Director, Child Welfare Compliance officer and",
    "Program Manager all review the Book of Business on a weekly basis to address\nany barriers or patterns. The chief administrator reported confidence the agency\nwill continue to see improvement over the next review period.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed via telephone. Staff reported feeling supported by\ncoworkers and supervisors. There were no concerns reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, licensing and adoption services. All files were stored\nsecurely and there is a cross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n_______ 12/11/2024_________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n12/23/2024\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
