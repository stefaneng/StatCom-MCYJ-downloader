    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care or incidents of\nsubstantiated corporal punishment during this licensing period.\nThe facility has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility experienced significant turnover through the last year as well as some\nunforeseen time off by the administrators. This appears to have negatively effected\nthe usual flow of the program as evidenced by the increased number of violations.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on their regular license.\nNovember 16, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 17, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
