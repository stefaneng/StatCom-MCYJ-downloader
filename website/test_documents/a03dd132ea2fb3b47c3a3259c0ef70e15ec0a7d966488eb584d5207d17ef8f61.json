    "Email to Administrator 1 and Program Manager 2- Complaint\nfinding; telephone call requested\n05/17/2022 Contact Telephone call received\nSpoke with Program Manager 2 – Preliminary findings provided\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency failed to initiate a special investigation on the licensed foster parents\nafter they took in placement of a former foster child without the agency’s knowledge.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 3/22/2022 I spoke with Complainant X by telephone. Complainant X reported\nChild A’s birth father, Parent C took the child to Foster Parent D and Foster Parent\nE, after someone contacted children services related to Child A on 9/8/2021. Child A\nhad been in the care of her mother, Parent B. Complainant X reported Child A\nsomehow ended up with bruises on her, which Complainant X reports were not on\nChild A on 9/8/2021 when children services came out see Child A and Parent B.\nComplainant X reported Parent C took Child A to Foster Parent D and Foster Parent\nE without a court order; and children services were involved in facilitating Child A’s\nplacement with these foster parents under a safety plan. She reported Child A being\nplaced with the foster parents was without proper placement criteria’s; and Bethany\ndid not investigate the foster parents related to them taking the child improperly.\nAdditionally, that at the time, Parent C was living on Foster Parent D and Foster\nParent ‘s property, which is also improper.\nOn 4/8/2022 I interviewed Program Manager 2, and Foster Care Worker 3 onsite.\nLicensing Supervisor 4 was contacted by Program Manager 2 while I was onsite;\nand I interviewed Licensing Supervisor 4 by way of Microsoft Team’s video\nconferencing.\nOn 4/8/2022, Program Manager (PM) reported the Department of Health and Human\nServices (DHHS)-Oakland County, not Bethany has full family responsibility for Child\nA’s and Parent B and Parent C’s case. She said there are three other children who\nwere placed with Parent B. That Parent B has a criminal case pending related to\nphysical maltreatment pertaining to Child A. PM 2 reported that Foster Parent D\ncontacted the agency to say children services placed Child A with them under a\nsafety plan. She said, DHHS- Oakland County children services made the\nplacement without Bethany’s knowledge. PM 2 reported Licensing Supervisor 3\ncould better explain what occurred. She reported no knowledge of Parent C ever\nliving on Foster Parent D’s and Parent E’s property, as alleged in the complaint.\nOn 4/8/2022, Licensing Supervisor 4 affirmed PM 2’s reporting related to children\nservices putting Child A in Foster Parent D’s and Foster Parent E’s foster home\nwithout contacting Bethany. She reported Child A being in the foster home was not\nreally a foster care placement. She said the agency discovered children services\ncontacted the foster family and was inquiring about placement capacity prior to\n3",
    "Bethany’s knowledge of the situation. Children services had a meeting with Foster\nParent D and Foster Parent E sometime in October 2021, which may have been\nbefore or after Foster Parent D and Foster Parent E reported the situation to\nLicensing Supervisor 4 on 10/18/2021. She said, the foster parents became\nconcerned they were doing something wrong and called the agency. Licensing\nSupervisor 4 said she reached out to the DHHS-Oakland County children services\nworker on 10/18/2021 or 10/19/2021. The Children Services Specialist (CSS) X0\nreported not knowing the rules; but did not disclose why they reached out to the\nfoster parents directly, as opposed to Bethany. Licensing Supervisor 4 reported that\ndue to foster home rules, Child A could not be in the foster home without official\nremoval from the birth home or a safety plan; nor without a borrowed bed agreement\n(BBA) with Bethany. She instructed CSSW X0 on what needed to be done to\nexecute a BBA for Child A in Foster Parent D’s and Foster E’s foster home. She\nsaid, the BBA was completed, effective for 10/22/2021- 1/11/2022 when Bethany\ntook case responsibility.\nLicensing Supervisor 4 provided me a copy of that BBA which showed a 10/22/2021\nverbal authorization date, as well as a 10/22/2021 effective date for the placement.\nLicensing Supervisor 4 acknowledged that on 10/15/2021 Child A would have been\nphysically in the foster home, as reported by the foster parents. Licensing Supervisor\n4 reported not knowing if Child A was in the home before 10/15/2021. She said the\nfoster parents reported Parent C came to the home with Child A, some time before\n10/15/2021 asking for assistance. The foster parents told Parent C he should not be\nthere. Licensing Supervisor 4 reported not knowing if the child stayed after Parent C\ncame to the foster home. She reported Foster Parent D and Foster Parent E\nreported they did not contact Bethany on 10/15/2021, because they thought DHHS\nwas communicating with Bethany. She said DHHS told the foster parents it was\nokay for the child to be there. She advised the foster parents that was not true.\nShe reported Foster Parent D and Foster Parent E were Child A’s prior foster\nparents; and after Child A went home, the foster parents maintained a\nrelationship/contact with Child A and Child A’s birth parents. She said the foster\nparents would have insinuated Child A was placed there on a safety plan but that is\nnot true because there was no communication from DHHS with Bethany until\nLicensing Supervisor 4 reached out to DHHS after Child A was in the home. She\nsaid Bethany would not have completed a body chart on Child A during that time\nbecause there was no concerns or reasons to ask about that because Bethany had\nnot yet received the child’s case. She also reported no knowledge of Parent C ever\nliving on Foster Parent D’s and Parent E’s property, as alleged in the complaint.\nOn 4/8/2022, Foster Care Worker (FCW) 3 affirmed PM 2’s reporting related to not\nbeing aware of Parent C ever having lived on the foster parents’ property.\nOn 4/14/2022. I interviewed Foster Parent D by telephone. Foster Parent D reported\nbeing a licensed foster parent for 10 years. She reported Child A was officially\nplaced in her’s and Foster Parent E’s home on 10/22/2021. Prior to that Child A was\n4",
    "in the home under other circumstances. Foster Parent D reported that Parent C\nshowed up to their home on Sunday, 9/5/2021, reporting he had gotten kicked out of\nhis home; and Parent B was beating on Child A. She advised they had been\nsupportive to Child A’s birth family in the past and had communicated on and off with\nthem. She and Foster Parent E provided Parent C a hotel room; but Parent C kept\ncalling them about things that was happening. Parent C was scared and panicking\nas to what to do related to what he reported was maltreatment occurring to Child A,\nso they advised Parent C to contact the police. Parent C did so, and the police\nadvised Parent C of his right related to Child A. On 9/8/2021 Parent C arranged\nsomething with Parent B; and Parent C acquired Child A. Parent C brought Child A\nto her and Foster Parent E. Child A was in their care from 9/8/2021 onward because\nParent C asked them to keep Child A.\nFoster Parent D said, children services visited their home the evening of 9/8/2021 to\nsee if Child A was okay. She acknowledged children services did not mandate that\nthey keep Child A in their home, but children services checked the home because\nParent C told them this is where Child A would be living. Therefore, children services\nwas approving this setting for Child A at that time. Additionally, children services did\nnot tell her they would reach out to Bethany, nor advised her to contact Bethany.\nFoster Parent D reported contacting her worker, on 10/8/2021 and advising the\nworker of Child A being in the home and them working with Children Services\nWorker 5. Foster Parent D did not contact Bethany when Child A first came to be\nliving in the home, because they did not know when or if Child A might officially\ncome into foster care. They “just thought it was an emergency situation”. That it was\nonly going to be for a couple of days. They were trying to help Parent C to get a\nplace to stay. Foster Parent D reported, sometime after, children services and the\npolice stopped communicating with them, they reached out to Bethany’s licensing\nstaff in early October 2021 to ask them if they could help related to the placement.\nFoster Parent D reported they were not trying to keep Child A’s placement in their\nhome a secret. They thought children services and DHHS were the same and were\ncommunicating with one another. She thought that if an officially placement was\nwarranted, DHHS would complete the BBA, if it led to that. I asked Foster Parent D\nwhether home visits occurred by Bethany workers while Child A was in the home,\nprior to her contact with the worker on 10/8/2021. Foster Parent D reported Worker\n6 had seen Child A in the home. She told Worker 6, she was helping out a friend;\nand it was a long story.\nI asked Foster Parent D whether Parent C was living on their property at any time.\nFoster Parent D admitted Parent C had. She explained that Parent C was never in\nthe home. He stayed in the back of their property in a fifth Wheeler (A trailer that is\nbehind or pulled by a truck) located with the cars. Parent C stayed there for a few\ndays, whenever he was not in a hotel. She said, as of 10/15/2021, when the safety\nplan was put in place, Parent C was off their property entirely. This was shared with\nBethany; Bethany helped put the safety plan in place. Foster Parent D stated “I\nshared all this with Bethany when I reached out to them. I told them the whole story.”\n5",
    "On 4/19/2022, I spoke with Children Services Specialist (CSS) X0 by telephone.\nCSS X0 reported they did not place Child A into Foster Parent D’s and Foster Parent\nE’s home. The complaint was with the birth parents; and Parent C had put Child A\nwith these foster parents. CSS X0 said they did not initially know Foster Parent D\nand Foster Parent E were foster parents, they thought the foster parents were\nfriends of Parent C. CSS X0 reported their department was just assessing the\nsafety plan Parent C was purposing for Child A, whom he had taken custody of. CSS\nX0 said her department was just giving support for Parent C’s safety plan. They did\nnot force or tell Foster Parent D and Foster Parent E they must keep Child A. “All\nwas voluntary until the court got involved.” A couple days after her contact with\nFoster Parent D and Foster Parent F she became aware that the couple were\nlicensed foster parents. She reported she did not reach out to Bethany about what\nwas happening, because she did not know to do so. She did know the protocol or\nissues related to a BBA. Bethany/ Licensing Supervisor 4 reached out to her. She\nrecalled something about a BBA, but not the specific. She reported, there was a\nmeeting sometime later in October, whereby the foster parents were in attendance,\nbut by that time she was no longer the worker; the case had gone back to the\nprevious children services worker.\nReviewed:\n Child A’s MISACWIS case record which showed Child A (now age 4) was\nplaced with Foster Parent D and Foster Parent E on 10/22/2021- 1/11/2022;\nthen 1/11/2022 to present. It also showed Child A was previously placed with\nthese foster parents on 11/9/2017- 11/16/2017; then again on 12/11/2017-\n6/25/2019 when Child A was returned home.\n Bethany’s borrowed bed agreement with DHHS-Oakland County for Child A.\nThe agreement is signed by Bethany and DHHS- Oakland County on\n10/22/2021.\n Foster Parent D’s and Foster Parent E’s MISACWIS provider record which\nshowed two 10/18/2021 social contacts by way of email and phone contact\nwith Foster Parent D by Worker 6:\n In the first social work contact that was by email, it indicated it was for\npurposes of introducing the new worker; and to address sleeping/ bedding\nconcerns, and options. That during the conversation, Foster Parent D\nreported she took a previous child back into her home as a safety plan\ncreated with children services. Worker 6 advised Foster Parent D she\nshould notify her licensing worker within 24 hours of any changes to the\nhome. During the conversation, Foster Parent D reported that she had\nnotified her foster care worker “K” that Child A had been placed since last\nTuesday (which was 10/12/2021).\n In the second social work contact that was by telephone, it indicated the\nworker informed Foster Parent D, that Foster Parent D needed to send the\nchildren services worker's contact information to ensure follow up could be\nhad, due to children services not being able to place a child, without talking\nwith the agency first.\n6",
    " Child A’s MISACWIS case record which showed a children services 10/12/2021\nsocial work contact entered on 10/29/2021 which indicated:\n A scheduled visit was conducted at Foster Parent D’s home to meet with\nParent C and verify the well-being of Child A. The well-being of Child A was\ndocumented, and the contact indicated Child A appeared very comfortable\nwith Foster Parent D and another child in the home.\n During the home visit information was taken from Parent C related to Child\nA’s children services allegation for the beginning of September. How Parent\nC intervened with the police; left his home and subsequently removed Child\nA from the home the same day.\n Additionally, that a safety plan was established and agreed upon by Parent\nC. Parent C agreed to have Child A remain in the home of Foster Parent D.\nParent C agreed to have supervised visits only with the child. He agreed to\nbe available for all of her needs. This contact indicated this safety plan\nmeant that Parent C would leave Foster Parent D’s and Foster Parent E’s\nhome; and he agreed to do this.\n A social ork contact of a telephone call with a worker at Bethany on 10/8/2021 was\nnot documented.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in\nthe agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(b) Initiate a special evaluation of the foster home as\nsoon as is indicated, based on the information received, but\nnot later than 7 calendar days after receipt of the\ninformation.\nANALYSIS: The evidence showed the foster parents took Child A into their\nhome on 9/8/2021, prior to 10/18/2021. The foster parents made\nthe information about Child A being in the home known to the\nagency after the fact on 10/8/2021 and or 10/18/2021.\nAs of 10/18/2021, the agency knew Child A had been in the\nfoster home prior to 10/18/2021 without proper notice to the\nagency. The agency did not initiate a special evaluation to\ninvestigate a possible rule violation or the circumstances of\nChild A’s presence in the home. Nor the birth father’s\ninvolvement related to the child’s placement in the home or his\npossible presence in the home, or on the property, the latter of\nwhich Foster Parent D confirmed.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "ALLEGATION:\nThe agency failed to look for any relative placements. Additionally, the agency has\nnot provided services to Parent B or informed the birth parents of medical\nappointments for the child.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant X reported that Child A’s case plan is reunification and Parent B has\nnot seen her child since 9/8/2022. Further that Bethany has not made contact with\nParent B and has not tried to provide services to the birth parents. Nor is the agency\nalerting Parent B of medical appointments for Child A. Complainant X reported\nParent B is on probation for two years, and reports this was based on testimony from\nFoster Parent D related to an alleged statement by Parent B that, “the baby is dead\nto her”. Complainant X reported the foster parent also took Child A for a Trauma\nAssessment without alerting the birth parents. Additionally, that Bethany is letting\nthe foster parents get away with all of this. Complainant X expressed concern that\nthe foster parents, and Bethany are not concern with the other children. Compliant X\nreported it is all just a “set up to get Child A (for adoption) and that the worker lied in\ncourt. Complainant X did not clarity what the worker lie about. Nor did Complainant\nX report concern related to the agency having explored or not explored a relative\nplacement for Child A.\nProgram Manager 2 reported DHHS has full family responsibility for Child A’s case;\nand the agency has been working with DHHS related to the case and the special\ncircumstances related to it.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 3 affirmed PM 2’s reporting related to DHHS having full\nfamily responsibility. She said DHHS made the referral for Child A’s trauma\nassessment. Additionally, DHHS was offering and providing services to Parent B\nand Parent B had been completing those services. FCW 3 reported Bethany had a\nmeeting with DHHS related to the case plan. DHHS was trying to decide whether\nthey would continue with the case. She reported Bethany’s responsibility for Child A’\ncase was effective 1/11/2022. She said Parent B has a two year no contact order\nin place related to Child A. She said Child A has yet to be adjudicated as a ward of\nthe court.\nFCW 3 reported the agency had not officially offered services to Parent B or Parent\nC because DHHS, not Bethany has full family responsibility. She said DHHS\nreferred Parent B to counseling services. She said Bethany has had contact with\nParent C and is offering parenting time. Bethany will also be offering him services.\nShe said she has also reached out to Parent B at least three times; asking if she had\nquestions. Parent B does not want contact with Bethany. As for the agency not\nseeking out relatives or informing Parent B or Parent C of medical appointments for\nChild A. FCW 3 reported Parent C approved the placement with the foster parents;\n8",
    "and no medical appointments have occurred since Bethany took over Child A’s\ncase. All other appointments were handled by DHHS; inclusive of DHHS scheduling\nChild A’s 1/31/2022 trauma assessment. Therein, all notification related those past\nscheduled appointments would have been DHHS’s responsibility. FCW 3 reported it\nwas true that Foster Parent A took Child A for a 1/31/2022 trauma assessment. She\nalso attended the trauma assessment, because it and her attendance at the trauma\nassessment was court ordered. She said the trauma assessment would have been\nindicated and or discussed at court, and thereby the birth parents would have known\nabout the appointment. FCW 3 further reported that its true that Child A is in\ncounseling and that too was referred by DHHS-Oakland County. Bethany followed\nup on it; and Child A had an intake and has had three therapy sessions (at the time\nof FCW 3’s interview).\nFCW 3 reported Child A’s case plan remains reunification. She reported with respect\nto Foster Parent D making some statement in court related to Parent B, that was at\nParent B’s criminal case. The agency is not aware of how the criminal case came to\nbe, but the Foster Parent D was asked by the prosecutor to give an “impact\nstatement”, and Foster Parent D did so. After the hearing, a male, reported to be\nrelated to Parent B threatened the foster parent; and thereafter put the foster\nparents’ photo and address on social media, asking someone to hurt them. The\nfoster parent did not set out to do anything to cause harm to the birth parent.\nOn 4/19/2022 I spoke with DHHS-Oakland County FCW XX by telephone. She is\nthe family worker and foster care worker for Child A’s three siblings. She affirmed\nthat DHHS has full family responsibility for this case. She reported she and FCW 3\nwork together with respect to tangible related services. She said adjudication was\npending related to Child A, and services were placed on the records for Parent C at\nthe last hearing, in April 2022. She said, the court has not made requirements of\nParent B as of yet. A no contact order remains in place for Parent B. Bethany’s\nFCW 3 was at the last court hearing.\nReviewed:\n Child A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n Bethany, per a DHS-3600(Case Referral and Acceptance, Individual\nService Agreement) accepted Child A’s case on 1/11/2022.\n A 10/22/2021 Interim Placement court order, alleging repeated and\nsubstantial maltreatment by Parent B and ordering that DHHS take Child\nA into protective custody\n Child A’s 11/20/2021- 2/17/2022 updated service plan completed by\nBethany which showed:\n Parenting time had been suspended by the court pending a trauma\nassessment for Child A.\n A 2/10/2022 social work contact/ for a FTM (Family Team Meeting)\nattended by Parent B, and her attorney, Parent C and his attorney,\nthe children service worker, Worker 5, DHHS- Oakland County\nFCW XX; FCW 3; and an unnamed parent partner. During this FTM\n9",
    "there was discussions by the attorneys, FCW 3 updated the group\nthat she still is awaiting the outcome of the 1/31/2022 trauma\nassessment, and gave a status updated of Child A’s therapy which\nbegan 1/7/2022. FCW 3 also provided the name and contact\ninformation for the therapist to all the FTM attendees. Additionally,\nFCW 3 apprised the attendees that Child A is on a wait list\npertaining to Child A’s court-ordered psychological assessment. A\nparenting time schedule was explored during this FTM session\nwithout resolution during the FTM due to the attorneys, and parents\narguing over such arrangements.\n Reunification is the permanency goal. Parent B and Parent C must\nobtain and maintain housing, employment, and mental health\nservices. Both parents will participate in some form of parenting\nclasses. Parenting time will remain suspended until further order\nfrom the court.\n Telephone contacts with Parent B and Parent C by FCW 3 in January 2022\nand with Parent C also in April 2022.\n Child A’s 9/10/2021, 10/29/2021; 11/29/2021 medical exams; 11/15/2021\ndental exam was prior to Bethany’s 1/11/2022 acceptance of the case, as\nreported by FCW 3.\n DHHS- Oakland County has full case responsibility and numerous contacts\non the case, with Parent B and Parent C by the county worker.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 913-5 Placement Resources: Child Placing Agency Family\nResponsibility\nFamily Responsibility:\nThe contractor shall provide all needed services to a family unit\nfor the purpose of reunification and/or permanency planning.\nServices shall include placement planning and preparation,\nservice referrals for parents and children, the arrangement and\nfacilitation of family visitations (including the provision of\ntransportation as needed) as well as court responsibility\n10",
    "ANALYSIS: Bethany is not the primary service agency; it does not have full\nfamily responsibility. DHHS-Oakland County has.\nBethany has maintained contacts with the DHHS- Oakland\nCounty service worker; and has had contacts with the parents\nrelated to exploring if they had questions, and exploration for\nparenting time if approved by the court. The agency also\nfollowed through with service referrals for Child A as put in place\nby DHHS prior to the Bethany’s case acceptance.\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the allegations.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date June 12, 2022\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 14, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n11"
