The youth notified\nmanagement.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nMDHHS Worker was interviewed via phone on January 16,\n2025. MDHHS Worker reported Youth A disclosed these concerns\nwhen she was interviewing him as a collateral contact for another\ninvestigation. She reported Youth A stated there was no other\nstaff around when the incident occurred. MDHHS Worker\nreported Youth A did tell someone at the facility and reported the\nincident was looked into, but it is unclear what the outcome was of\nthe internal investigation.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the foster care\nagency on January 24, 2025, in collaboration with MDHHS\nWorker. Youth A reported in December 2023, Staff 1 had\nrecorded a video of Youth A when Youth A was in his underwear.\nWhen asked to explain more of what happened, Youth A reported\nhe was permitted by Administrator 1 to move his clothes out of the\ncloset in a room that was unoccupied back into his own room. He\nreported he was in the process of moving his clothes to his room\nwhen Staff 1 started his shift. Youth A reported Staff 1 works the\nthird shift. He reported Staff 1 told him that he could not be in the\nunoccupied room. Youth A reported that when he was in the\nunoccupied room, Staff 1 continued to tell him that he could not be\nin this room and Youth A began to argue with him. He reported\n2",
    "Staff 1 did not like that he was not following his direction, so he\nstood in the doorway of the unoccupied room looking in at Youth A\nand told him he was not moving until Youth A followed redirection.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 then took out his personal cell phone. At\nfirst Youth A thought Staff 1 was going to use the Google\nTranslate application on his cell phone to listen to the\nconversation Youth A was having on the phone with one of his\nfriends but then noticed Staff 1 had the camera application open\nand was recording him. Youth A reported he felt uncomfortable\nwith Staff 1 taking a video of him because Youth A had a t-shirt\non, his boxers, and socks when the video was being recorded. He\nreported Staff 1 would not leave the doorway either, so Youth A\ncalled the police who never did anything about this situation.\nYouth A reported he spoke to Administrator 1 on the phone and\nthen had Staff 1 switch out with another staff member due to\nYouth A not feeling comfortable. He reported there were no other\nstaff members present when this occurred and the only youth that\nwas around was Youth B, but he does not know if he heard or saw\nanything.

When\nasked if he ever recorded a video or took photos of youth at the\nfacility with his cell phone he denied. Staff 1 was shown the video\nof him recording Youth A and he reported he forgot about this\nsituation since it was over a year ago. He confirmed he was the\nperson recording the situation on his personal cell phone. Staff 1\nreported he was trying to get the audio recording of him and Youth\nA because he was speaking in Spanish. He reported he was trying\nto just record the ground but did get a glimpse of Youth A. Staff 1\nreported he was redirecting Youth A that he could not be in that\nunoccupied room, and he became verbally argumentative about\nthe situation. He reported he attempted to call the on-call\nsupervisor, who he could not remember, but could not talk to them\n3",
    "until later. Staff 1 reported he started to record on his phone\nbecause there are no cameras in the bedroom and was worried\nYouth A may pull him into the bedroom as Youth A has a history\nof being violent with staff and he wanted to ensure his safety. He\nreported he did send the video to Administrator 1 as she was the\nhome supervisor.

She reported she did receive the video in\nquestion from Staff 1 to her agency-assigned cell phone.\nAdministrator 1 reported when she spoke with Staff 1 about this,\nhe was doing the recording because Youth A was known to make\nallegations about staff and become violent and he wanted to\ndocument what was happening. She reported the video did show\nYouth A for about a second and he was fully clothed.\nAdministrator 1 reported that staff are not allowed to record youth\non their cell phones as this is against their cell phone policy.

He reported he spoke to Youth A briefly in Spanish\nabout what was going on and Youth A told him Staff 1 was trying\nto kick him out of the room. Youth B reported Youth A should have\nnot been in this room as this was not his room.
