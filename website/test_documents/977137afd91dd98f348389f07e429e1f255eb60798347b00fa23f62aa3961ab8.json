Consumer\nRights Officer reported on the day in question there were four staff\nmembers on the wing. Staff were doing the evening chores and\nthere was a bottle of cleaner that staff placed on the desk. All\ncleaning products are kept in a locked closet outside of the wing,\nbut staff were doing the evening chores and the cleaner is used to\nclean the showers after the youths take their showers. There were\nthree staff members on the wing, staff immediately called for a\n“clear” (other youths are removed from the wing), contacted the\nnurse, and Youth A was transported to the hospital.
