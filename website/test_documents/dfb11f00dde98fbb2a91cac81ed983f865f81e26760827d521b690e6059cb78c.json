INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.12308 Application submission.\nSection (1) An agency shall act on a completed and signed application.\nDescription\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not act on a signed foster parent application.\nInvestigation The Complainant, also Perspective Foster Parent (PFP) filed an\nonline complaint and did not provide a phone number. Via email I\nnotified her I was assigned to investigate her complaint and did\nnot receive a response.\nOn 2/23/2023, I notified the Chief Administrator via email of the\nallegation filed against the agency. I held a conference call with\nLicensing Supervisors 1 and 2, and Licensing Worker 1 on\n2/23/2023. I requested documentation and a summary of the\nactions taken on PFP’s foster home application by the agency.\nDocuments Reviewed\nFoster Home application DCWL-3389 signed and dated by\napplicant on 4/2/2022\nLicensing Record Clearance DCWL-1326 (not dated by applicant)\nFoster Home Contact Sheets\nOn 2/27/2023 Licensing Supervisor 2 provided the following\nchronological summary of events:\n2",
    "On 11/12/2021, the agency received a licensing referral for PFP\nas she had children placed in her home and was considered a\nfictive kin placement. From January – April 2022, PFP completed\norientation, GROW trainings and background/fingerprinting.\nPFP completed and signed a foster home application on 4/2/2022.\nLicensing Worker 1 was assigned on 4/19/22. Enrollment\ndocuments were completed and sent to DCWL in May 2022. In\nJune 2022, the first initial home assessment was completed where\nPFP was informed that financial and Administrative Review Team\n(ART) documents were needed due to her criminal history.\nFurther she was informed her fingerprints had to be redone due to\nher failing to sign the required document.\nFrom July – September 2022, contact with PFP was sporadic as\nshe reported to the licensing worker that she was no longer able\nto care for the children in her home due to finances. PFP also\nwas unable to provide valid criminal history information which\nmade the ART difficult to complete.\nIn September 2022, PFP reported to the licensing worker that she\nhad redone her fingerprints. At that time, the licensing worker\ninformed her another home assessment and updated financial\ninformation were needed due to the time that had passed and the\ncomposition of the household changing. In October 2022, PFP\nallowed Licensing Worker 1 to complete a second home\nassessment. Again, PFP was informed of all documentation that\nwould be needed. Although the process was explained to her,\nPFP became upset whenever new or additional documents were\nrequested. Licensing Worker 1 continued efforts to contact PFP,\nbut she was uncooperative through December 2022. In early\n2023, she contacted Licensing Worker 1 stating she had gotten\n“lazy” which is why she had not submitted documents. PFP was\nreminded that additional/new documentation would need to be\nsubmitted. At that point, she became upset and belligerent toward\nLicensing Worker 1 and Licensing Supervisor 2.\nIn early February 2022, a meeting was suggested with foster care,\nlicensing and PFP. However, PFP refused indicating she would\nnot speak with licensing and was going to file a complaint.\nTo date PFP still has not provided proof of income or that her rent\nis current. Further, she reported she will never pay the entire\namount of what is due on her rent, utilities and phone bill which is\ncausing her bills to increase and a risk of shut offs.\n3",
    "Licensing Supervisor 2 indicated that the agency is still interested\nin continuing efforts to license PFP. However, her cooperation in\nsubmitting proof of her income, rent and utilities payments is\nessential to completing the process.\nAnalysis Documentation provided by the agency shows they acted on\nPFP’s completed and signed application.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nFebruary 28, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 8, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
