    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff qualifications\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Allegation 1: The evening of 5/10/24 Staff 1 arranged for adults\nto beat Youth M outside the building while unidentified staff\nwitnessed.\nAllegation 2: Staff 1 was observed drinking on the job.\nInvestigation I was assigned this investigation on 5/13/24. The complainant is\nanonymous.\nRegarding Staff 1 or others drinking on the job, this was\ninvestigated in SIR 2024SIC0001300 dated 5/8/24 and there was\nno evidence to support it.\nInterviews:\nGovernment Worker 2 checked Youth M’s well-being on 5/10/24\nand took photos of his face.\nI notified Youth M’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation\nassignment. She expressed no licensing concerns pertaining to\nWolverine Center.\nI contacted Chief Administrator (CA) on 5/13/24. She said she\nwas not in the building when Youth M returned from AWOL on\n5/10/24 and informed staff he was assaulted by someone. CA\nwas not aware of any injuries. However, the youth was seen at\nthe emergency room that night and reported the assault to law\nenforcement. CA was unaware if anyone witnessed the assault in\nthe street.\nI scheduled staff interviews in collaboration with Government\nWorker.\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker on\n5/17/24. He has worked at the facility for seven months.\nSupervisor said it was reported that Youth M assaulted a youth\n2",
    "who functions at a much younger age than himself, so Supervisor\ncalled 911. “Youth M stormed out the exit door and I followed him.\nHe picked up bricks. I redirected him. He walked up Lenox to\nCharlevoix. He was in the street with bricks in his hands. I\nreturned to the front of the building and watched him from a\ndistance down the street. Youth M walked back toward the\nWolverine property. I saw a car coming down the street real fast.\nThe car stopped in front of the building and two guys jumped out.\nI’m not sure if they had a weapon or not. I didn’t want to break it\nup and risk getting stabbed. One man threw punches at Youth M.\nYouth M curled into a fetal position…I could not see the age of the\nman. It was dark…The men did not say anything…It was a black\nsedan.”\nSupervisor was asked why men in a car might want to assault\nYouth M. He answered, “If I was to guess, Youth M threw a brick\nand that car panicked.” Supervisor said the only witnesses to the\nassault were him and Staff 1. Government Worker asked\nSupervisor if he had any concerns relative to Staff 1. He said he\nhad no concerns.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker on 5/17/24.\nShe has worked at the facility for over a year. Government\nWorker read the allegations aloud. Staff 1 said Youth M\nreportedly assaulted a youth on the third floor and the youth was\ncrying. “Supervisor called 911 for the assault. Youth M left the\nfloor and the building. He paced outdoors with bricks in his hand.\nYouth M walked down the street to Charlevoix. I stayed outside in\nfront of the building. Youth M yelled out to cars passing by and\nwent out of my view. He made it back and a black car stopped. I\nsaw two guys pull up. Supervisor and I moved away…I was\nscared.” Asked if Staff 1 knew the men in the car, she answered,\n“No. It could’ve been a car he was cussing at.” She denied\nsaying anything to Youth M related to the men in the car. “I saw\nYouth M afterward for a second and saw no marks.”\nStaff 1 said she knows the identity of the anonymous complainant.\n“There’s one staff (Staff 2) who complains about everything I\ndo…We dated for a short period of time,” she added.\nI interviewed Youth M jointly with Government Worker on 5/17/24.\nOn his unit, he said he had an altercation with a “slow kid” and\nwalked off the unit and out of the building without permission.\nOutside he said, “Staff 1 was trippin’ and I was cussin’.” Staff 1\nremarked that “I had better hope ‘they’ get here soon.” Youth M\ndid not know who Staff 1 was referring to as ‘they.’ Youth M said\n3",
    "he walked up the street to the next road. He denied he had\npicked up bricks and denied carrying them in his hands or cussing\nat vehicles. “I walked back (to the front of the building). A black\nMalibu pulled up and two dudes hopped out. Staff 1 pointed to me\nand said, “That’s the kid.” Youth M said both men got out of the\ncar and hit him. “I got on the ground and covered my face. They\ngot in the car and left. I told Staff 1, “You know you’re wrong for\nthat.” I asked him why Staff 1 did something wrong. He said,\n“Because she called them.” I asked why he thinks she called the\nmen. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence since she said earlier, I\nbetter hope ‘they’ get here soon…I told everybody that Staff 1 had\npeople beat me up.”\nDocuments reviewed:\nPhotos taken by Government Worker 1 of Youth M’s face show ¼\n“scratches above his left eyebrow and above his left upper jaw\nwith discoloration below his left eye.\nDischarge instructions from Beaumont Grosse Point Hospital\ndated 5/10/24 indicate Youth M was assaulted by an unknown\nperson. His arm, hands and legs were x-rayed. He was\ndiagnosed with contusion of the right upper extremity and\nperiorbital ecchymosis of the left eye and treated with Ibuprofen.\nAn incident report by Supervisor dated 5/10/24 at 9:40pm\nindicated while Youth M was outdoors without permission, he\npicked up two bricks and walked up the street toward Charlevoix.\nSupervisor redirected youth to put the bricks down and return to\nthe building, but Youth M kept walking and started playing in the\nmiddle of Charlevoix. Supervisor returned to the building to wait\nfor police who he called for Youth M’s assault on a youth on the\nthird floor. Supervisor witnessed a car pull up, and males jumped\nout and attacked Youth M. Supervisor was already waiting for\n911, but they never showed. A body chart completed on 5/10/24\nat 9:40pm showed no visible marks on Youth M at that time.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis It was concluded that if Staff 1 told Youth M he had “better hope\nthey get here soon,” she was referring to 911 as Supervisor had\ncalled them and she and Supervisor were waiting for the ‘them’ to\narrive. Staff 1 and Supervisor denied that Staff 1 pointed the\nyouth out to the men who pulled up in the car. Staff 1 denied\nknowing or arranging for the men to assault Youth M outdoors in\nfront of the facility.\n4",
    "This incident was reported to law enforcement. If law enforcement\nis able to identify the men who assaulted Youth M and one or both\nare related to or associated with Staff 1, this portion of the\ninvestigation will be reopened, and an addendum will be\ncompleted.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 admitted using discriminatory language toward Youth M\nand being suspended for three days.\nInvestigation Interview:\nStaff 1 stated “Youth M said stuff to me, and I responded in the\nwrong way and reported myself…I called him a ho-ass ‘n-word’\nout of frustration, called CA and punched out.”\nDocument reviewed:\nI reviewed an Employee Counseling Form dated 5/10/24 that\nconfirmed Staff 1 was suspended for three days on 5/11/24,\n5/13/24 and 5/14/24 for inappropriate communication toward\nYouth M.\nAnalysis Staff 1 admitted using discriminatory language toward Youth M.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJune 10, 2024\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 18, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n6"
