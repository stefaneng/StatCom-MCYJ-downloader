Complainant\nreported an investigation regarding Foster Parent was assigned on\n1/4/2024 at 3:45PM. Complainant reached out to the agency and was\ninformed someone completed a home visit at the Foster Parent’s house\non 1/4/2024 to verify wellbeing of the child. Complainant found a\ncontact entered in MiSACWIS, indicating a face-to-face visit occurred,\nin the foster home, on 1/4/2024 at 4:20PM. The contact stated the\nyouth was observed in the foster home, and allegations were discussed\nwith Foster Parent. Complainant contacted Foster Parent regarding the\ninvestigation and asked if the agency discussed the allegations at the\nhome visit. Foster Parent indicated to Complainant that no one from the\nagency went to their house on 1/4/2024. Complainant reported Foster\nCare Supervisor (FCS) was contacted via email to confirm the visit was\ncompleted at the foster home. FCS responded that a home visit was\ncompleted by Foster Care Worker 1 (FCW1) with Foster Parent and the\nyouth on 1/4/2024. Complainant provided DCWL with a copy of the\nemail with FCS, a screenshot of the 1/4/2024 MiSACWIS case contact,\nand the text messages of the foster parent denying a home visit\noccurred. Complainant stated the 1/4/2024 MiSACWIS contact was\nlater edited by the agency to reflect it was a video conference, not a\nface-to-face home visit. The edit was made after Complainant informed\nthe agency and DHHS of the discrepancy.\n2",
    "DHHS Staff was interviewed via TEAMS on 1/29/2024. DHHS Staff\nreported she was aware of the allegation and it was accurate. A\ncomplaint was received on 1/4/2024 regarding Foster Parent. A\nconcern was later reported to DHHS that the agency began an\ninvestigation without coordinating with children’s services. This\nprompted DHHS Staff to look at case contacts, where it was observed a\nface-to-face home visit occurred with Foster Parent on 1/4/2024, noting\nthe allegation was discussed. DHHS Staff emailed with FCS, who\nconfirmed a home visit had occurred on 1/4/2024. DHHS Staff was later\ninformed by children’s services that Foster Parent indicated a home\nvisit did not occur on that date. DHHS Staff looked at the contact in\nMiSACWIS and observed the 1/4/2024 contact had been changed to\nreflect “video conference” instead of face-to-face home visit. DHHS\nStaff informed the agency Program Manager and Chief Administrator of\nthe concern regarding false documentation.\nFoster Parent was interviewed by phone on 1/29/2024.\nFoster Parent reported that a home visit was not completed on\n1/4/2024. FCW1 completed a video call on that date. Foster Parent\nstated the only agency staff she saw in person in January was a\nlicensing worker that visited with children’s services on 1/11/2024 for an\ninvestigation, then another agency staff on 1/17/2024 to move the\nyouth. Foster Parent reported she accepted placement of the youth on\n11/8/2023. A former foster care worker, (FCW2) who is no longer with\nthe agency, completed placement paperwork during a home visit about\na week later. Foster Parent could not recall any other home visits\ncompleted by agency staff. Foster Parent stated no one came out to\nvisit in December 2023. Foster Parent recalled FCW2 completed a\nvideo call and saw the youth at the agency previously, but never visited\nthe youth in the home. Foster Parent stated FCW1 was just recently\nassigned and had not been to the home. Follow-up email contact\noccurred on 1/30/24 with Foster Parent as a review of case contacts\nfound that a foster home visit was documented in MiSACWIS for\n12/4/2023. Foster Parent stated that she had several texts with FCW2\nthat day, but a home visit did not occur on that date.\nFoster Care Worker 1 was interviewed via TEAMS on 1/31/2024.\nFCW1 reported that children’s services asked her to complete a home\nvisit and set up a safety plan, as a new investigation was starting.\nFCW1 intended to go to the foster home on 1/4/2024. However, she did\nnot have her car. FCW1 did not want to cancel the visit and decided to\ncomplete a virtual visit. FCW1 reported that she later, mistakenly,\nentered the contact as “face-to-face” rather than virtual. FCW1 said\nFCS was aware it was a virtual visit and not in person, as she knew\nabout FCW1s car problem. FCW1 stated FCS likely told DHHS that a\nvisit was completed, as she was aware a virtual visit occurred. FCW1\n3",
    "clarified that she knew a virtual visit was not the same as an in-person\nvisit to the home. FCW1 reported that it is a requirement for foster care\nstaff to have home visit sheets completed and signed by the foster\nparent for every visit.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via TEAMS on 1/31/2024.\nFCS reported that she and FCW1 spoke about the need for a home\nvisit to occur, due to the new special evaluation. FCW1 stated she was\ngoing to go out to the home on 1/4/2024. FCS was aware FCW1 had\ncar trouble, but believed she was borrowing a car as she had done\npreviously. FCS stated when FCW1 said she was going out to the\nhome, she did not have any reason to doubt her. FCW1 had always\nbeen someone to follow through and do what is required. A few days\nlater, DHHS Staff contacted FCS and asked if a visit occurred. FCS\nanswered yes, as she believed FCW1 had gone to the foster home on\n1/4/2024. Later, during supervision, FCS was reviewing cases with\nFCW1 and referenced the home visit. FCW1 stated she did not go out\nto the home but completed a video call instead. FCS informed FCW1\nthat MiSACWIS showed a face-to-face visit at the foster home. FCW1\nappeared to be unaware and stated it was an error. FCS instructed her\nto correct the case contact. FCS stated that she has since discussed\nwith FCW1 that she must report any change in plans. FCW1 was also\nadvised to double check any contacts that are entered.\nFCS was asked about the 12/4/2023 visit completed by FCW2, FCS\nstated she believed the visit occurred as she recalled the worker\ncomplaining about getting home late. However, FCS was not present\nfor the visit, so she could not say for sure. FCS stated workers are\nrequired to complete a foster home visit form with foster parent\nsignature at every home visit. FCS was asked to locate the December\n2023 form and provide it to DCWL. On 2/7/2024, FCS reported that she\nwas unable to locate a home visit from for 12/4/2023.\nChief Administrator was interviewed by phone on 1/31/2024\nChief Administrator (CA) was aware of the allegation. CA spoke with\nFCS to ensure the 1/4/2024 contact was now documented accurately in\nMiSACWIS. CA stated there have been no prior concerns with FCW1s\nperformance. CA believed the contact was accidentally entered\nincorrectly by FCW1. However, an internal investigation was in\nprogress. CA was informed that it appeared a December 2023 home\nvisit may have been entered when it did not occur. This contact was\nentered by staff that was no longer with the agency. CA was unsure if\nall staff were using foster home visit forms. A follow-up phone call\noccurred on 2/14/2024, in which CA shared the findings of her internal\ninvestigation and was informed of the findings for this investigation.\nPotential action steps for the CAP were discussed.\n4",
    "Documents Reviewed\n• Email dated 1/5/2024 at 9:02AM, agency was informed of\ninvestigation by children’s services.\n• MiSACWIS screenshot of case contact entered on 1/5/2024 at\n10:08AM, by FCW1. Contact indicated a foster home visit, on\n1/4/2024, for 45-60 minutes, face-to-face, at the foster home at\n4:20PM. “home visit in child’s residence” was marked. Narrative\nstated a home visit occurred, allegations were discussed with\nFoster Parent, youth was present.\n• MiSACWIS case contact for 1/4/2024, was viewed on 1/26/2024.\nThe contact had been edited to indicate the visit was a video\nconference, not a face-to-face home visit.\n• Text between Complainant and Foster Parent. Foster Parent\nreported a virtual visit occurred on 1/4/2024, not a home visit.\n• 1/10/2024 emails from FCS to Complainant and DHHS stating\n“We met with (Foster Parent) on January 4, 2024, for a home\nvisit” and “The home visit was completed on the evening of the\n4th”.\n• MiSACWIS case contact for 12/4/2023 indicated a home visit\noccurred at the foster home, with the youth and Foster Parent.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed, it was determined\nagency staff inaccurately documented in MiSACWIS that a foster home\nvisit occurred on 1/4/2024. In addition, another foster home visit on\n12/4/2023 was entered into MiSACWIS but could not be verified.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
