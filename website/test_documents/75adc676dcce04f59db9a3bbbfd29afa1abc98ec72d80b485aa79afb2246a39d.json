Some mildew present around shower and on curtain.\nEnsure these bathrooms/showers are cleaned more often to avoid mildew and\nmold growth.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require or request any consultation.",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere was 1 substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. This was investigated through SIR #2024C0000965SI dated 1/3/24. The\nstaff who was substantiated for threat of physical harm was terminated from\nemployment.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 4 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\n- One CAP was from the 2023 Interim Inspection, which resulted in 7\nlicensing rule violations related to central registry clearances, TB\ntesting, physical exams, initial treatment plan, unsigned treatment\nplans, and lack of a discharge plan. The CAP included the facility\ncreating and utilizing a new hire process form, retraining hiring\nmanagers, retraining & tracking physical exams for youth, tracking due\ndates for treatment plans, reviewing policy requirements for treatment\nplans and discharge plans. The violations for employee records are for\nboth TLC and Ridgeview programs, but the violations regarding youth\nfiles are strictly for TLC. The CAP was ineffective as 5 of those rule\nviolations are repeats for this Renewal Inspection. Additional corrective\naction planning is required to address the continuous citations.\n- One CAP was from SIR #2023C0000769SI dated 10/20/23. There was\na violation for Rule 400.4158(1)(a)(ii) due to a staff pushing a youth.\nThe facility implemented and completed the CAP successfully. The\nCAP included reviewing restraint policy, implementing a coaching plan\nwith one staff, terminating the staff who pushed the youth,\nimplementing mental health first aid training for all staff, implementing a\nspecial safety plan/de-escalation training for all staff, and ensuring staff\ncontinue to attend CPI training as required.\n- One CAP was from SIR #2024C0000965SI dated 1/3/24. There was a\nrepeat violation for Rule 400.4158(1)(a)(ii) due to a staff pushing a\nyouth. This was a different staff than the previous investigation. The\nfacility implemented and completed the CAP successfully. The CAP\nincluded terminating the staff who pushed the youth, reviewing restraint\npolicy, reviewing/retraining on the self-awareness/de-escalation quick\nguide, staff continuing to attend CPI training, and a hands-on retraining\nfor de-escalation.\n- One CAP was from SIR #2024C0001035SI dated 1/29/24. There was a\nviolation for Rule 400.4127(4) regarding bed checks and ACT 116",
    "722.120(1)(c) regarding falsification of bed check logs. The facility\nimplemented the CAP successfully and has continued to send quarterly\ncompliance updates as requested. The CAP included supervisors\ncompleting weekly random video reviews and observation logs,\nretraining staff on requirements for bed checks and falsification (initially\nand annually), and discussing requirements/providing discipline during\nsupervision with staff as required.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's 2024 financial budget and Bethany Christian Services' 2023 financial\naudit were reviewed. There were no concerns noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nThe MDHHS Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) compliance monitoring report\nwas completed on 12/15/22 and the facility was found in compliance with all\nstandards. The facility also received a certificate of completion for compliance\nmonitoring for December 2022-December 2023.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted the facility continues to improve compliance in\nmultiple areas. CA hopes 100% compliance can occur now that the facility has a\nnewer program director, new assistant program director, new supervisor, and new\ncase management supervisor for the TLC program. CA noted the new hire and\ntransfer hire checklists implemented in February should resolve violations related\nto employee files. CA noted hiring a new case management supervisor for TLC\nshould resolve the violations related to youth treatment plans and discharge\nreports. CA noted there were a significant number of youth admitted during this\nperiod of review who had increased levels of trauma. As a result, they challenged\nrules, were destructive, struggled with basic program compliance, were abusive to\nstaff, and ultimately created an unsafe environment. CA noted, at times, the\nbehaviors of these youth adversely impacted staff’s ability to perform job duties.\nCA noted they intend to separate TLC to a different license and plan to begin the\nprocess in July 2024.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff feel the training they receive is relevant but can be repetitive. Staff feel\nsupported and love their roles. Even through transitions of management at TLC,\nstaff expressed feeling supported and know who to go to if there are concerns or\nissues. Staff feel the policies and procedures are adequately communicated but\nfeel there needs to be more transparency regarding “why” policies and/or\nprocedures might be changed. Staff feel the transparency would make them feel",
    "like communications about the changes are about building relationships rather\nthan forcing compliance.\nYouth reported staff treat them well and care about them. Youth reported they get\nenough food, and the food is good. Youth reported they feel safe at the facility.\nSome youth at Ridgeview feel there are youth who are unsafe due to their\nbehaviors but feel staff quickly and adequately intervene.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA tour of the facility occurred during the inspection on 6/5/24. The facility was\nclean and in good condition. There were no safety concerns noted during the\ninspection.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJuly 18, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 19, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
