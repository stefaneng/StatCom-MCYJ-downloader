INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family time for\nDescription each child in foster care consistent with the child's service plans,\nas required by R 400.12419 and R 400.12420 to ensure the safety\nand well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation Parents residing out of state have not been offered parenting time\nsince case management transitioned from one worker to another a\nmonth ago.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nFoster Care Program Manager\nOn 11/20/2024 I spoke with Foster Care Program Manager\n(FCPM) by telephone about his complaint. FCPM affirmed the\nagency has the case this complaint relates to. He reported the\nworker who originally had the case, Foster Care Worker (FCW) 1\nwent on leave of absence on 10/28/2024; and did not ask for case\ncoverage which may have impacted the continued timeliness of\nthe parenting visitation schedule. He reported the case was\ntransferred to FCW 2, and another supervisor, Foster Care\nSupervisor (FCS) 2 effective 10/28/2024. He said Monday and\nTuesday at 5:30m were the days parent/child visitation were to\noccur. He said a visit occurred on Monday 10/28/2024. He\nreported given FCW 1’s departure and FCW 2 trying to work out\nscheduling and to coordinate the visits, there may have been a\ncouple of weeks where there was no visit. He reported the\nchildren are in two different foster homes and that too may have\nimpacted scheduling. She reported FCW 2, and FCS 2 would\nhave more specifics related to the parent/child visitation situation.\nAdditionally, the prior foster care supervisor, FCS 1, may be able\nto speak to what FCW 1 had done related to parent/child visits.\n2",
    "Parent A\nOn 12/2/2023 I interviewed Parent A about this complaint. He\nexpressed concern that his children were removed from his care\nby children services for a false and erroneous reasons. He\nreported in the past the court had ordered there to be two visits\nper month for he and his wife, Parent B, with their children, twin\nboys, Child C, and Child D, and daughter Child E. He reported his\nboys are placed in one foster home and his daughter in another\nfoster home. He reported after his case transferred from FCW 1\nto FCW 2 there was a month without a visit. He reported he and\nhis wife live out of state; and although he knows FCW 2 “came to\na messed-up case” that FCW 1 left without notice and her leaving\nimpacted on their visitation schedule, his concern is why is the\nagency not calling him. Why is he not getting his parenting time\nand getting it when he is available. He said FCW 2 is trying to\narrange some visits, but they put all the children on at the same\ntime, and there has only been one visit since 11/18/2024, which\nwas on 11/25/2024. He said the FCW 2 said she was trying to\narrange visits for Mondays when he is off; and also Wednesday;\nbut he works on that day. He is free up to 5:00PM on Wednedays\nand also free any other weekday. He said he just wanted his\nchildren back and is awaiting on ICPC (Interstate Compact on the\nPlacement of Children) to assess he and Parent B; but in the\nmeantime, he just wants to see his children and wants the workers\nto call him. He is concerned the department is trying to keep his\nchildren.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) 2\nOn 12/10/2024 I interviewed FCS 2 by telephone. FCS 2 affirmed\nshe and FCW 2 received responsibility for Child C, Child D, and\nChild E’s cases on 10/28/2024, after FCW 1 left without notice.\nFCS 2 reported after the case transferred to FCW 2, FCW 2\nbegan trying to make contacts with Parent A and Parent B that\nday. FCS 2 reported the parents were consistently difficult to get\na hold of due to their telephone being turned off or different issues\nwith their email which the parents were apparently communicating\nthrough. Parent B’s email was incorrect; they only had Parent A’s\nemail, at first, and they were initially sending emails to this email\nwithout success.\nFCS 2 reported the agency has offered parenting visits to the\nparents. She said, FCW 2 set the parent/child visitation for\nMondays and Wednesdays, as Tuesdays could not be\naccommodated by FCW 2’s work schedule and is not constantly\nfeasible for the two different care providers. FCS 2 reported\n3",
    "Parent A and Parent B reside in Missouri and parenting times are\nvia TEAMS. She reported the visitation was set with FCW 2\nsupervising the parent/child visitation via TEAMS on Wednesday\nand a social service aide supervising the Monday visitations.\nFCS 2 said they set up a calendar invite, and they were sending\nthat to the parents via text and Parent A’s email. She said a\nparenting time would have fallen on 11/11/2024, a state holiday,\nso they offered a makeup visit on 11/12/2024. FCS 2 said the\nagency’s contacts were not all being responded to by Parent A.\nFCS 2 reported sometime in November 2024 they learned Parent\nA had apparently gotten some of the contacts from them but had\nnot contacted the worker. Parent A had apparently also contacted\nhis attorney about what he thought was a lack of contacts to him;\nand the attorney contacted the agency. FCS 2 said they apprised\nthe attorney of their outreach to Parent A and Parent B, and the\nattorney indicated he would let Parent A, know. FCS 2 said Parent\nA and Parent B finally contacted the agency on or about\n11/14/2024; which was also when she got more involved. She\nsent an email to Parent A on 11/21/2024 related to a parenting\nvisit and obtaining Parent B’s email to send Parent B the link so\nthey could get on the parent/child visit. FCS 2 said she sent the\nlink to Parent B twice by text and email. She said the parents were\nable to visit on 11/18/2024 and 11/25/2024; everyone was on the\nTEAMs visit. Two other scheduled visits, which were on\nWednesdays (11/20/2024 and 11/27/2024) were not successful,\nbecause either the caregiver or parents did not get on the visit.\nFCS 2 said there have been visits set but unfortunately due to the\nparents not responding to the TEAMS link or not logging on only\ntwo visits have been successful. She reported the latter could\nhave also been due to the family having a problem with their Wi-\nFi. The agency learned Parent B’s phone was only working on Wi-\nFi (it was not known if the family had other Wi-Fi in the home).\nFCS 2 reported the family has since indicated they are getting\ntheir phones back on tomorrow, 12/11/2024; which should help\nthem with successfully connecting to the visits. She said another\nvisit is set for 12/11/2024 and everyone is set for that visit. FCS\nadmitted there was an issue with the Wednesdays 5:30PM\nparenting time for Parent A, in that Tuesday is what Parent A,\nwanted because with Wednesday, he could only be on for a half\nhour due to needing to leave for work. She reported the case is\nbeing transferred from her and FCW 2 to FCW 3 and another\nsupervisor this week; and this should help with scheduling. She\nsaid Parent A and Parent B have been apprised of this change.\nFCS also reported, the children’s case plan remains reunification\n4",
    "and the ICPC is being sent this week for the out of state home\nstudy on Parent A and Parent B.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)1\nOn 12/18/2024 I interviewed FCS 1 by telephone. She affirmed\nbeing the supervisor for the prior worker, FCW 1 and FCW 1’s\ndeparture from the case. She affirmed Parent A and Parent B’s\nparenting time was occurring virtually on Mondays and Tuesdays.\nShe said FCW 1 was sending out emails to the parent for those\nvisits. She reported the parents often had problems logging on or\ncouldn’t find the parenting time visitation link. She reported the\nparents never complained about missed parenting visits. What\nthey consistently complained about was children services and\ntheir belief the children should not have been removed from them.\nShe reported any time parenting visits were missed it was due to\nthe parents. They either could not figure out how to log on to the\nparenting visit or they did not log on. FCS 1 reported the parents\nissues were substance abuse related; she was not aware of the\nparents having cognitive delays that may have caused their\ndifficulty logging on to any of the virtual parenting times.\nFCS 1 reported after the case transferred to FCW 2’s and FCS 2’s\nsupervision, Parent A’s attorney reached out to her via email\naround Veteran day; and she followed up with him on or about\n11/14/2024. The attorney indicated Parent A was saying FCW 1\nwas no longer his worker, and he had not had a visit since FCW 1\nleft. She provided the attorney FCW 2, And FCS 2’s name and\ncontact information. She said Parent A had also reached out to\nher on 11/11/2024, when the agency was closed, and she\ncontacted him back with FCW 2 and FCS 2’s information as well.\nFCS 1 was not sure how many visits had been scheduled with\nParent A and Parent B, but the parents lack of consistency in\nkeeping parenting times had been discussed in past meeting.\nShe was also not aware of efforts FCW 2, and FCS 2 had made\nwith the parents after she provided their contact information to the\nparents.\nFoster Care Worker 2\nOn 1/3/2025, I interviewed FCW 2 by telephone. FCW 2 affirmed\ninformation as reported by FCS 2 related to FCW 1’s departure,\ntheir efforts in trying to contact the parents and the parents\ntechnology issues and difficulties. FCS 2 said she set the parent/\nchild visits for Mondays and Wednesdays. She said the parents\nwere initially okay with the change of parenting time from Tuesday\nto Wednesday. Parent A later voiced a concern of Wednesdays\n5",
    "not being good for him, because he could only attend for the\nbeginning of the visit. He would have to leave for work. The\nWednesday time worked for the caregivers and Parent B. FCW 2\nreported given that the agency was closed one Monday in\nNovember 2024 and the holiday in November the time gap that\nexisted after FCW 1’s departure and her taking over the case was\nabout two weeks. She reported visits she supervised were for\n11/18/2024, 11/25/2024, 12/2/2024(which the parents missed due\nto technology issues). She said a visit was also set for\n12/12/2024, but she did not supervise that one, because the case\nhad transferred to FCW 3. She reported the delay in scheduling\nvisits was due to barriers outside her control, not due to a lack of\nher trying to connect to the parents and to set the parent/child\nvisits in November 2024.\nDocumentation Review\nCopy of emails or text messages\n• Copy of a 11/12/2024 email from FCS 1 to Parent A\nadvising him of FCW 1’s departure without notice on\n10/28/2024, and the agency had been trying to figure out\nwhat FCW 1 had or had not completed since that time.\nAlso, that FCW 2 and FCS 2 have been assigned to his\ncase, are aware that parenting time needs to be set up\nvirtually, and the ICPC request completed.\n• Copy of text messages from FCS 2 showing various\ncontacts to Parent A and Parent B, and some replies from\nthe parents. Various texts showed the parenting link was\nattached; or that the agency or the parents were asked\nabout problems contacting the other. The messages\nconveyed that the agency was not able to connect with\nthem and asked the parents if the agency had the wrong\ncontact information.\nMISACWIS case record for Child C, Child D and Child E, which\nshowed:\n• Child C, Child D and Child E were last made temporary\ncourt wards on 12/18/2023. This was the third time Child C\nand Child D were made temporary court wards; and the\nsecond time for Child E.\n• Parenting time visits after a parenting time visit on\n10/28/2024 were set for 11/11/2024 (which could not occur\nas the agency was closed for Veteran day- the parents\nwere offered a makeup), 11/18/2024; 11/25/2024,\n12/2/2024 (which did not occur because the parents never\nlogged on); 12/9/2024 (the visit was cancelled because\nneither the parents nor the caregivers confirmed for the\n6",
    "visit); 12/11/2024, 12/16/2024, 12/19/2024; 12/23/2024;\nand 12/30/2024 (all of which occurred with the parents; with\nall the children attending).\n• A 11/20/2024 and 11/21/2024 text message from FCS 2 to\nChild C’s and Child D’s caregiver reminding the caregiver\nof a parenting time that was occurring for the former, and of\na upcoming visit that day for the latter. This caregiver’s\nparticipation was encouraged.\n• Emails and or texts messages to Parent B and or Parent A\nfrom FCS 2 and FCW 2 about visitation.\n• A copy of a 12/9/2024 ICPC for a home study request to\nthe state of Missouri completed by FCW 2.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence does\nnot show that the agency deliberately and purposely delayed\nparenting time for the parents after FCW 1 left the agency. Nor\nthat the agency did not develop a parenting time plan for the\nchildren’s family. The agency was trying to maintain contact with\nthe parents after FCW 1’s departure, and they continued to\nschedule parenting time visits.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the agency’s current licensing status is recommended.\nFebruary 10, 2025\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 25, 2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n7"
