INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation In July of 2022, Youth A was dragged and thrown around by Staff\n2.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on\n02/26/2024.\nI emailed complainant and no additional information was\nprovided.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations and\nMISACWIS history for Youth A. Youth A was placed at the agency\non 12/08/2021 and discharged on 07/22/2022 to an independent\nliving program in Kalamazoo. Youth A’s MISACWIS case was\nclosed on 01/24/2023 and last contact with Youth A was made\n01/24/2023. A telephone number was found in the system for\nYouth A.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Chief Administrator (CA) on 01/29/2024 via\ntelephone. CA reported Youth A was placed at the agency from\n12/8/2021 to 07/22/2022. Youth A was released to a Specialized\nIndependent Living program in Kalamazoo. He denied any\nincident involving Youth A being dragged or hurt by Staff 2. He\nsaid there is one incident dated 07/14/2022 involving Youth A\nbeing restrained for aggressive behavior, but there is no\ndocumentation that Youth A was dragged or hurt during that\nincident. CA said Staff 2 resigned from the agency in October of\n2022 and is no longer employed at the agency.\n2",
    "I attempted to contact Youth A via telephone (telephone number\nlisted in MISACWIS) on 1/29/2024, the telephone number found\nwas incorrect.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 02/26/2024 via telephone. Staff 1 is the\nresidential coordinator and has been working at the agency for 20\nyears. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was the afternoon supervisor. Staff\n1 recalled Youth A being at the agency in 2022 and said Youth A\nnever reported Staff 2 dragged or hurt him. Youth A was very\noutspoken and if staff did something, Youth A would have spoken\nabout it. She said Staff 2 was very calm and liked by all the\nyouths. She does not recall any youths ever complaining about\nStaff 2. She said Staff 2 resigned in 2022 because he was working\nanother job and there was more room for advancement in the\nother job.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 03/01/2024 via telephone. Staff 2 reported\nhe was employed at the agency for 7 years and resigned in\nOctober of 2022. He worked as a 2nd shift supervisor prior to\nleaving the agency. Staff 2 denied dragging or ever hurting Youth\nA. He recalled having a good rapport with Youth A and does not\nrecall any incident where he used an inappropriate method to\nphysically manage a youth. He could not recall the incident on\n07/14/2022 when Youth A was restrained. Staff 2 said he could\nnot recall what happened or why Youth A was restrained.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 03/01/2024 via telephone. Staff 3 is a\nresidential counselor and has been working at the agency for\nalmost four years. Staff 3 recalls the incident on 07/14/2022, and\nsaid Youth A was being aggressive and assaultive, so Youth A\nwas restrained by her and Staff 2. She denied Youth A was\ndragged or hurt during the restraint. Staff 3 said Staff 2 is by the\nbook and always attempted verbal de-escalation before physically\nrestraining a youth.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Probation Officer on 03/04/2024 via\ntelephone. Several attempts had been made prior to contact\nProbation Officer, but he had been off and returned to work on\n03/04/2024. Probation Officer reported he was Youth A’s\nprobation officer for approximately one year and it was during the\ntime Youth A was placed at the agency. He said Youth A never\nreported ever being dragged or hurt and always spoke very highly\nof the staff while placed at the agency. Probation Officer had\nattempted to reach out to Youth A after Youth A was discharged\nbut was unsuccessful.\n3",
    "I received an email from Youth A’s Foster Care Specialist on\n03/07/2024, stating Youth A was discharged from the Independent\nLiving Program in November of 2022 and she does not have\ncontact information for Youth A.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Behavior Management Policy and Procedures states,\nPhysical behavior management intervention is used only\nwhen it is assessed a youth is at risk of imminent harm to\nthemselves or others. The CPI Crisis Development Model\ndocuments that staff learning appropriate and effective\napproaches to crisis behaviors presented by youth. Staff's\nresponses are outlined and range from de-escalation to\nphysical restraint, physical management is the last option\nafter staff have exhausted all other efforts to de-escalate\nthe youth and they remain a danger to themselves or\nothers.\n• Youth A’s release plan dated 07/05/2022 through\n07/22/2022. Youth A was discharged to an independent\nliving home on 07/22/2022.\n• Incident report dated 07/14/2022 at approximately 6:07pm.\nWritten by Staff 2. Youth A returned from dining hall in a\nstate of anxiety, attempting to fight anyone who would take\nthe challenge. Staff 3 attempted to verbally calm Youth A\ndown. Staff 2 and Staff 3 placed Youth A in a team control\nrestraint. No injuries documented.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with the restraint of Youth A as\nevidence provided through written documentation and interviews\nwith staff indicates staff conducted an appropriate restraint.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMarch 5, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 7, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
