    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was 1 substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. The one report addressing maltreatment was reviewed and found to be\ncompleted thoroughly and accurately.\nThere was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. The one report addressing maltreatment was reviewed and found to be\ncompleted thoroughly and accurately.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP submitted by the agency was submitted in response to the 9/1/2022 interim\nlicensing inspection and was approved on 9/21/2022. That CAP addressed 14\ncitations, nine of which were not cited as violations during this inspection. The\nremaining five were repeated during this inspection. Three of the five repeated\ncitations; FTMs, PATP signatures, and Medical Passports have all been repeated\nduring the past two inspections and will require additional corrective action\nplanning to address the repeated nature and prevalence of the citations. Of the\nremaining two citations, Case Contacts was violated in half of the cases reviewed\nand dental examinations was an isolated incident during this inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator identified several areas of policy and data entry\nrequirements that have led to difficulty in maintaining compliance due the timely\nnature of duplicating work tasks. Additionally, there have been some case\ntransfers due to staff medical leave and two current case management vacancies\nwhich has resulted in some difficulty maintaining consistent compliance with all\ncase management requirements.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nOne staff interviewed expressed several concerns related to the CWLM system,\nBSC, and new foster home rule implementation. One staff interviewed expressed\nconcerns of feeling there is a focus on meeting deadlines and maintaining specific\nstatistics as opposed to providing quality services. One staff member reported no\nconcerns. All three stated they feel supported and encouraged in their daily tasks\nby their peers and direct supervisors.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to perform job\nresponsibilities. Case records and physical CHRI are stored in a method that\nprevents unauthorized access through the use of locked cabinets, locked storage\nshelves, and a locked storage room in which files are stored in closeable cabinets",
    "in which no unauthorized personnel are allowed to enter unless escorted by an\nauthorized staff member who will ensure the file cabinets are closed and not\naccessed while unauthorized personnel are present.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo Safety Concerns Identified\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJune 29, 2023\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 30, 2023\n____________________________________ _\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
