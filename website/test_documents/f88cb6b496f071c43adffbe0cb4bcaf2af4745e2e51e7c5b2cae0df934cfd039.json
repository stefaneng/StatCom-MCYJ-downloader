    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The CAP\nwas in response to the 6/12/2023 licensing interim inspection report. The CAP was\napproved on 7/6/2023 and addressed 6 violations (3 licensing rules and 3 DHHS\npolicy.) The agency CAP was not effective in eliminating noncompliance as all\nviolations addressed in that CAP were repeated during this year's inspection. It is\nnoted; however, the CAP was effective in reducing the individual instances of non-\ncompliance related to medical passports. All other repeated violations remained\nthe same or slightly increased in the number of files in non-compliance. Nine\nviolations (8 rules, 1 DHHS policy) were established during this inspection which\nwere not established during the previous year. It is noted of the 15 overall\nviolations established during this inspection, 8 were located in 1 file, 6 were found\nin 2 files, and 1 was located in 4 files. The agency corrective action plan must\nevaluate and address the repeated non-compliances as well as the additional non-\ncompliances not previously established. The management team did identify that\nthe majority of violation were located within a case record previously managed by\na worker who is no longer with the agency. Prior to this employee's departure, the\nemployee was receiving disciplinary action for performance related concerns.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was reviewed and discussed. The chief\nadministrator identified areas of non-compliance largely attributed to a high\nnumber of new staff learning the rule & policy requirements as well as individual\nstaff performance issues resulting in disciplinary action.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed reported feeling supported and assisted by leadership,\nindicating they have helpful group chats, meetings, and other resources available\nat all times. They report receiving policy and rule updates timely. They all talked\nabout control documents utilized to help keep them on track with due dates and\nrequired task completion, which they find helpful. No concerns were noted by any\nof the staff members.",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space and equipment to ensure delivery of\nfoster care, independent living, and certification services. Case files and physical\nCHRI are stored securely in locked cabinets that cannot be accessed by\nunauthorized personnel.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJune 11, 2024\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 12, 2024\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
