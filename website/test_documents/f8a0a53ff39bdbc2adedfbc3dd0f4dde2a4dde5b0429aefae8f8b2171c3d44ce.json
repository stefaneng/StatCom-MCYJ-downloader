FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe agency had two safety alerts this reporting period:\nSafety Alert # 1:\nConcern:\nOne foster child reported on 12/1/2022 that he was whooped with a belt by his aunt\nthe day before the DCWL Analyst’s visit. This child also reported he was hit by his\nuncle that same day. The child also reported receiving whooping when he gets in\ntrouble and being whooped with an extension cord by his uncle. The other foster\nchild in the home reported the aunt hits him in the mouth when he talks back. It was\nindicated that this information was not shared with the foster care worker because\nthe aunt is always present.\nResolution:\nThe DCWL Analyst made a centralize intake report related to the alleged\nmaltreatment. The agency conferenced this matter with the foster care staff on\n12/2/2022 and verified relative home visits for 10/11/2022, 11/23/2022. The agency",
    "reported that during both the October and November caregiver home visit each child\nwas seen by the foster care worker without the relative caregiver; and the children\ndid not disclose physical discipline being used by the caregivers. The children\nreported discipline being timeout and removal of privileges.\nThe agency further reported that the foster care worker completed a home visit with\nthe assigned Maltreatment in Care (MIC)worker on 12/2/2022 and during that time\none child reported being hit on the hand, but reported the bruise being from an\nincident at school, not his relative caregivers. The foster care staff safety planned\nwith the caregivers by advising that they are not to utilize any form of physical\ndiscipline. The children were taken for medical examination on 12/2/2022. The\nagency reported the MIC investigation related to the alleged maltreatment remains\nunderway.\nConcern:\nThe carbon monoxide detector in the home was beeping. The relative caregiver was\ninformed of the need to replace the battery; and she stated she would replace the\nbattery. The agency was asked to verify that the battery was replaced.\nResolution:\nThe foster care worker provided the relative caregivers a carbon monoxide detector\non 12/2/2022.\nSafety Alert # 2:\nConcern:\nThe children are sleeping in the basement. There is not a window that is large enough to\nbe used for egress.\nResolution:\nThe agency contacted the relative caregiver to address the safety concern. The relative\ncaregiver agreed to move the children’s’ bunk bed upstairs into her daughter's room so all\nof the children would be out of the basement. This was to occur the evening of 11/22/22\nand the relative caregiver agreed to send the agency’s specialist and supervisor pictures\nof the upstairs bedroom once the move was completed. The agency provided photos\nshowing the bunkbed had been moved from the basement into the stated room. The\nagency also discussed with the relative caregiver the option of assisting them financially\nwith renovations to the basement to assure there is an egress window and appropriate\nspace designated in the basement for a bedroom to allow the three teen girls to have more\nspace until the family can move to a larger home.\nConcern:\nThere is no smoke detector or carbon monoxide detector in the basement.\nResolution:\nThe agency provided a smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector for the basement.\nThe agency provided a photo showing the smoke/carbon monoxide detector installed in\nthe basement.",
