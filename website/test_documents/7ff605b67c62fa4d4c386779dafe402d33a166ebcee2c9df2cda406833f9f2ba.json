CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Consultation was not requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with this individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency submitted a corrective action plan (CAP) during this licensing period in\nresponse to the 2023 renewal inspection completed on 7/10/2023 and the CAP\nwas approved on 8/4/2023. The agency was cited for 6 violations. During this\nreporting period, there were no repeat violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The Chief Administrator (CA)\nreported that the retention of front-line staff continues to be a challenge for the\nagency. She reported the agency experienced a significant period of stability with\nzero turnover in the last quarter. The CA reported this is attributed to continuous\nefforts to recruit and retain staff with realistic expectations for the position and who\npossess significant skills and credentials, as well as training and support of\nsupervisors. She said a commitment to reduce caseload size, proactive planning\nfor staff departures, frequent check-ins and support of new staff and constant\nassessment and improvements in staff salaries and benefits. CA reported still,\nstaff are challenged by an observed increase in the intensity and acuity of the\nneeds of the children and parents served, who present with significant barriers to\nreunification and ability to benefit from services. Systemic gaps in adequate\nmental health services for both children and adults and lack of affordable and\navailable housing also present barriers in the agency work. The CA reported\nanother barrier is the delays in the processing of fingerprints by DCWL, consent\nfrom MCI (especially in competing party cases), as well as court delays throughout\nthis year continue to present significant barriers to timely permanency for children.\n3",
    "Lack of accountability and poor communication at times are factors which\nperpetuate and cause tension in collaborative relationships with DHHS. CA\nsummarized this by stating the personal and professional stressors experienced\nover the past four years undoubtedly continue to impact staff, but have been\nmitigated significantly by strong, extremely hardworking leadership, focus on staff\nmental and physical health and a clear message to staff that HATW's commitment\nto safety, compliance and service to families will not change, despite continued\nexternal challenges.\nFinancial Overview\nThe CA submitted the agency independent financial audit dated December 31,\n2023, and 2022. The agency annual budget was also submitted. Based on\nreview, there are no financial concerns.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff members onsite on 8/24/2024. Staff\nreported feeling supported by the agency. Staff reported that supervisors and\ncoworkers were available and will assist when needed. The staff reported they\nwould not change anything currently about the agency and enjoy working in the\nenvironment the agency administration, has created. The staff interviewed did not\nreport any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, licensing and adoption services. All files were stored\nsecurely and there is a cross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns.\n4",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n11/19/2024\n________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n11/20/2024\n__________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
