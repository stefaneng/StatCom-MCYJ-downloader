    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff are not searching youth returning from home visit\nInvestigation I spoke to Complainant 1 on 7/28/23. No new information was\npresented.\nAll interviews were conducted face to face at the facility on 8/1/23.\nAdministrator 1: Administrator 1 reported Youth A had a five-day\nhome pass with her foster home. When she returned, they found\npill bottle with her sister’s name on it. Administrator 1 reported\nthey took two vape pens and a marihuana pen from her two days\nlater. Administrator 1 reported they did not find the pens on her\nbut other residents made comments about them so they then\nbegan questioning and checking the home for those items. Youth\nA was using the weed pen in the shower. Administrator 1 reported\nthey complete searches on the youth when they come back from\nhome visits. Administrator 1 reported that they “pop bras”, check\novernight bags, purses and have the youth turn their pockets\ninside out.\nYouth A: Youth A reported she went on a home visit and\naccidently brought her sister’s pill bottles. Youth A reported that\nstaff checked her bags and found the bottles. Youth A reported\nshe has had the vape and marihuana pens since summer school\nin mi July. Youth A reports she placed the pen in the metal of her\nbra and staff, even with searching can’t find it. Youth A reported\nshe was smoking during shower time and staff got suspicious and\ntook it from her.\nYouth B: Youth B reported Youth A brought the two vape pens\nand one marihuana pen back from her most recent home visit.\nYouth B reported they smoked the marihuana pen together and\nthe staff knew something was “off” with them. Youth B reported\nthe staff questioned them and searched their rooms. Youth B\nreported staff didn’t find the marihuana pen at first but then later\nfound it. Youth B reported that Youth A was searched when she\ncame back from her visit, but the staff did not find it. Youth B\nreported staff search them every time they come back from an\noutside activity.\nI reviewed Incident Report #1 dated 7/26/23. All information is\nconsistent with the above interviews. Youth A returned on 7/25/23\n2",
    "from her home visit. The agency was given information on 7/26/23\nthat Youth A might have vape pens. That day they completed\nroom searches and could not find anything. They also had a\nconference call with the foster parents and case manager where\nYouth A denied having all items.\nI reviewed Incident Report #2: Youth A was told she would be\nsearched again. Youth A then took the vapes out of her bra and\ngave them to staff.\nI reviewed Incident Report #3: Staff was given information that\nthe two vapes were not the only pens in the house. Staff\nquestioned Youth A when she had completed her shower. Youth\nA then gave the marihuana pen to staff from her dirty clothes in\nthe shower room.\nI reviewed the policy concerning searches from home visits:\n…the Girlstown staff reserve the right to search you and your\nbelongings and/or collect urine sample for a random drug screen if\nit is warranted to do so…\nAnalysis Both youth reported staff completed searches for this particular\nreturn from Youth A’s home visit and reported staff do them\nregularly. Staff were able to find the pill bottles from their search\nbut not the vape and marihuana pens. When they were given\ninformation that these were in the home, they reacted quickly and\nsearched the rooms and contacted necessary parties to address\nthe situation.\nConsultation: The agency has a search policy but it does not go\ninto the particulars of how to conduct one, or where to search, or\nwhat to search. The agency may want to spell out those specifics\nwithin their policy.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n3",
