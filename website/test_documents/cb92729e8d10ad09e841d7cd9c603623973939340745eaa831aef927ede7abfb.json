    "facility currently speak his native language. The facility is in the process of finding an\nindividual who does speak his native language. Staff 1 did not use the appropriate\ntechnique when she grabbed Youth A’s shirt to keep him from assaulting Staff 4.\nThe treatment team is reviewing the behavior management techniques during the\ndaily shift change meetings and the monthly team meetings.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 11/2/2021. Supervisor 1 sat in on the\ninterview because she was familiar with some of the language of Youth A and could\ninterpret. Youth A reported feelings safe at the facility and being “well taken care of”.\nHe also reported having “no issues at this time”.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 11/2/2021. She reported being a witness to\nthe incident and not involving herself because she was not fully trained on the\nbehavior management technique. She gave a similar accounting of the incident as\nstated in the complaint but added not witnessing Staff 1 grabbing Youth A’s shirt.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 11/2/2021. She reported the situation as\nreported in the complaint. She made numerous efforts to deescalate Youth A while\nusing “body positioning in an attempt to keep Youth A and others safe”. She\nreported Youth A broke free from her restraint of him and punched Staff 4 in the\nback of the head. She attempted to stop Youth A after he broke free by grabbing his\nshirt because he was “moving too fast and I missed his body”. She admitted\ngrabbing Youth A’s shirt was not part of her training.\nI interviewed Staff 3 by phone on 11/5/2021. He reported being witness to the\nincident but not becoming involved because he had not completed his behavior\nmanagement training. He also reported finishing this training two days prior to the\ninterview. He reported everything with the exception of the shirt grabbing was\nappropriate by Staff 1. Staff 1 attempted to keep everyone safe including staff and\nYouth A.\nI interviewed Staff 4 by phone on 11/8/2021. She reported being present and\nbeing “attacked by Youth A” at the time. She denied observing the restraint because\nshe had her back turned and was trying to get away from Youth A. She reported a\nbelief that Staff 1 was trying to protect her from the assault from Youth A.\nVideo footage of 10/28/2021, Glen’s House was reviewed on 11/2/21. The video\nrecording revealed two different views of the restraint, and both showed the situation\nas described in the complaint and the verbal descriptions given by those present.\nYouth A breaks away from Staff 1 and rushes towards Staff 4 before striking her in\nthe head. Staff 1 can be observed attempting to grab Youth A but only getting a hold\nof his shirt.\nA tour of the facility occurred on 11/2/21. The area of the restraint was observed,\nand staff walked through the incident. The area is appropriate in all aspects.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
