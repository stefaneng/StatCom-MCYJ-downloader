A follow up ultrasound was ordered.\n3",
    "I interviewed Youth A at the facility on 10/03/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Youth A reported he has been at the\nfacility for 5 months. He was on Pod H and was moved to Pod J\nlast week. He was involved in a fight with another youth on Pod J\nlast week and his arm was hurting him, so he was examined by\nthe Nurse. He said that staff restrained him when he was moved\nfrom Pod H to Pod J. He admitted that he swung and punched\nStaff 1 during the transport. He said Staff 1 told him “I am going to\nbreak your arm.” He said there were several staff and security\nofficers that transported, but he only remembers Staff 1\nthreatening him. He said his shoulder hurt during the restraint and\ntransport, and it got worse after he got into a fight with another\nyouth two days later. Youth A admitted that he has an old injury\nfrom when he was in another placement and sometimes his\nshoulder hurts when agitated. Youth A reported all his needs are\nbeing met and he did not express any concerns regarding staff or\nthe facility. Youth A did not want to talk about why he was moved,\nand denied bullying or being bullied while he was on Pod H.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 10/03/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 1 is a security officer and has been\nworking at the facility for 5 months. He has completed all training\nincluding Handle with Care, the facility’s restraint model. Staff 1\nreported he and 3 other staff were on Pod H to assist with a\ntransport. He and Staff 3 approached Youth A to escort, and that’s\nwhen Youth A started to punch him. Staff 2 and Staff 3\nimmediately stood between him, and Youth A. Youth A was\nescalated and attempted to assault staff, so Staff 3 and Staff 2 put\nYouth A in a two person hold and escorted Youth A off the Pod.\nHe denied threatening or using any form of force with Youth A.\nStaff 1 did not assist with the transport after being assaulted by\nYouth A.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 10/03/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 2 is a security officer and has been\nworking at the facility for one year. Staff 2 reported he witnessed\nYouth A assaulting staff while being transported off the Pod. He\ndenied staff used force when transporting Youth A. He and Staff 3\ndid have to put Youth A in a two person hold during the escort\nbecause he was being assaultive with staff and did not want to be\nmoved. Staff 2 said Youth A is very manipulative and was upset\nbecause he was moved off the Pod. He denied hearing Staff 1\nthreatening Youth A. He said Youth A was the one threatening\nStaff 1. He denied staff used force during the escort. He spoke\nwith Youth A after the transport and Youth did not complain or\nreport his shoulder hurt. Youth A was upset about being moved off\nPod H.\n4",
    "I interviewed Staff 3 at the facility on 10/03/2023, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 3 is a security officer and was\ninvolved in the transport of Youth A on 09/26/2023. He reported\nYouth A was agitated about being moved and started to swing at\nStaff 1. He and Staff 2 immediately put Youth A in a two person\nhold and escorted Youth A off the pod. He said it took less two\nminutes to move Youth A off the Pod. He denied staff threatened\nor used force during the transport. He said Staff 1 was targeted by\nYouth A, so Staff 1 did not assist with the transport. He said staff\ntalked and counseled Youth A about his behavior after the\ntransport and Youth A did not report being hurt or his shoulder\npopping out of place. Staff 3 said Youth A is very manipulative and\nwas upset about being moved off Pod H.\nI interviewed Manager 2 at the facility on 10/03/2023, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist. Manager 2 reported Youth A\nhad been bullying and manipulating other youths on the pod, so it\nwas determined that Youth A needed to be moved off the Pod. It\nwas a planned move and Youth A was informed that he will be\nmoved. He said there were three security officers and one\nsupervisor on the Pod. Youth A became very escalated and\nassaultive when staff approached him to do the transport. Staff 2\nand Staff 3 put Youth A in a two person hold to escort him off the\nPod. Manager 2 did not assist with the hold but was following staff\nduring the transport. He denied Staff threatened or used force\nwhile transporting Youth A. He spoke with Youth A after the\ntransport and Youth A did not report being hurt or injured.\nOn 10/25/2023 a predisposition conference was held with MDHHS\nSpecialist and MDHHS Supervisor. There is no finding.\nVideo Reviewed:\n• Video footage is from 09/26/2023 at 3:00 pm Pod H (Note:\nthere is no audio). Youth A was observed on the unit with\nStaff 1 and Staff 3. Staff approach Youth A, and he\nimmediately swings and punches Staff 1 in the arm. Staff 2\nand Staff 3 step in between Youth A and Staff 1. Youth A is\ntrying to go after Staff 1, so Staff 2 and Staff 3 put Youth A\nin a two-person standing restraint for 30 seconds and then\nescort him from Pod H to Pod J at 3:03 pm.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident reported dated 09/26/2023 completed by Manager\n2. The incident noted resident assault staff. While on Pod H\nin the dayroom, security was instructed to enter Pod H to\ntransport Youth A to Pod J. Youth A refused the directive of\nManager 2 to transport off the Pod. Youth A assaulted Staff\n5",
    "1 by striking him in the arm. Staff 2 and Staff 3 stepped in\nbetween them. Youth A was escorted to Pod J by Staff 2\nand Staff 3. After the incident Manager debriefed and\ncounseled with Youth A in his room. Youth A is scheduled\nto be examined by the nurse.\n• Critical and Unusual Incidents policy. The policy notes that\nall employees are responsible for documenting any and all\ncritical/unusual incidents involving residents. The\ndocumentation must be on the witness statements and be\ncompleted by the end of the shift. The Facility Manager or\nSupervisor must complete a summary documentation of the\nincident before the end of the day. Incidents are reviewed\nfor accuracy by the Supervisor, then again by the Facility\nManager, and then finally by the Director.\n• Handle with Care physical intervention manual for\nparticipants.\n• I reviewed the policy for Behavioral Management System,\nbehavioral intervention techniques, Safe Physical\nIntervention, and Use of Seclusion Rooms policy. Physical\nrestraint touching the youth and restricting his/her\nmovement in any manner.\nAnalysis The facility is not in violation of the rule based on interviews with\nstaff and youth, video footage, and documentation. The restraint\nused during the escort did follow the approved restraint model\npolicy Handle with Care. There is insufficient evidence that\nYouth’s shoulder was injured as a result of the restraint.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
