    "9/6/2024 12:16 PM Phone Interview\nIII. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff responsibilities.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The foster care worker allowed the relative to transport the toddler\nfoster child without a proper car seat or booster seat.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nFoster Parent 1: On 7/18/2024 I interviewed Foster Parent 1 by\ntelephone. Foster Parent 1 confirmed the information stated in the\ncomplaint. She reported, Child A (age 4) and Child B(age2) whom\nshe and her husband, Foster Parent 2, had fostered since\n9/11/2020 and 12/1/2021 respectively were recently replaced from\ntheir foster home. She reported following a Family Team Meeting\n(FTM) on 7/12/2024 they were allowed a goodbye visit with the\nboys on 7/16/2024. Foster Parent 1 said they met Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) and the relative caregiver at a park for the goodbye\nvisit. When it was time for the children to leave, Foster Parent 2\nwent to buckle Child A into the relative caregiver’s car and noticed\nthere was no car seat or booster seat. Foster Parent 2 advised\nFCW of this. FCW rolled her eyes and said okay. FCW did not go\ncheck the relative caregiver’s car. FCW let the relative caregiver\nleave. Foster Parent 1 reported concern about the car/booster\nseat because of the law, and what she thought was a lack of\nconcern for its absence by FCW.\nChief Administrator: I spoke with Chief Administrator (CA) about\nthis allegation by telephone on 7/19/2024. CA reported not being\npresent on the day of the incident. She reported FCW completed a\nsafety plan with Relative Caregiver that Relative Caregiver cannot\ntransport without a proper safety seat. CA reported Relative\n2",
    "Caregiver sent a picture showing that she had the car seats. CA\nadvised that Relative Caregiver had car seats prior to this incident\nas it was documented in Relative Caregiver’s 3130A Assessment,\nwhich was completed prior to the children’s goodbye visit at the\npark. CA was not sure why Relative Caregiver did not have the\ncar seat with her at the park to transport Child A.\nFoster Care Worker: On 7/25/2024 I interviewed Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) by telephone. FCW denied rolling her eyes as\nreported by Foster Parent 1 but did not deny the allegation. She\nexplained the situation. She reported when the foster parents told\nher there was no car seat for Child A, she did not know where to\nget a car seat in the moment, and given that she does not have\nchildren, she did not know it was not appropriate for Relative\nCaregiver to transport Child A without a car or booster seat. She\nsaid because of her not knowing this she reached out to her\nsupervisor during the situation by text, and later by telephone. Her\nsupervisor advised her that since Child A was only four years old,\nChild A should be in a car seat. FCW reported Relative Caregiver\nhad pulled away prior to her contact with her supervisor. FCW\nadmitted she did not problem solve the situation in the moment.\nShe “took it as make sure they do not do it again” so she\ncompleted a safety plan with the relative caregiver on 7/17/2024.\nShe also verified that Relative Caregiver had a car and booster\nseat. Relative Caregiver reported she had the car seat but since\nshe came to the park with four of her five children in the car, she\ndid not bring it as there was not room. FCW said she also\ncompleted a car seat training with Relative Caregiver on\n7/24/2024. FCW reported Relative Caregiver has since\npurchased a van to be able to safely transport all the children.\nSupervisor: On 9/6/2024 I made a follow up telephone contact to\nthe agency at which time I interviewed Supervisor. Supervisor\nconfirmed information as reported by CA and FCW related to the\nsituation at the park, and Relative Caregiver reporting to have car\nseats prior to the children’s placement with her. Supervisor\nclarified that when FCW called her from the park, she did not\nknow if Relative Caregiver was still at the park. She advised FCW\nto go verify what the foster parents reported about no car seat for\nChild A, and that’s when FCW said Relative Caregiver had left. At\nthat point Supervisor advised FCW to develop a safety plan with\nRelative Caregiver, which FCW completed. Supervisor reported\nthe agency does have car seats at the agency which can be used\nin emergency situations/when needed.\nDocument Review:\n3",
    "• Initial Relative Placement Home Study-3130A dated\n7/3/2024 which indicated Relative Caregiver had access to\nrequired safe seats for transportation.\n• Copy of a 7/17/2024, email to Relative Caregiver from FCW\noutlining a safety plan which indicated: Relative Caregiver\nwill ensure Child A and Child B ride in a child safe car seat\nwhile in a vehicle, being transported, and that the children\nwill be buckled in before the vehicle drives away.\nAdditionally, that Relative Caregiver will contact Ennis for\nassistance with car seat installation if needed and will\nreference the car seat manual to ensure the car seats are\nbeing used appropriately and the children fit their seats\ncorrectly.\n• Copy of a 7/17/2024 email reply from Relative Caregiver to\nFCW regarding the safety plan that indicated Relative\nCaregiver had read everything and agrees to the terms of\nthe safety plan.\n• A signed statement by Relative Caregiver dated 7/24/2024\nshowing she received car seat training.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed there is evidence\nthe worker was unable to problem solve the situation completely in\nthe moment, but safety planned with Relative Caregiver shortly\nafter the incident. Her actions related to this safety planning\ndemonstrated the agency’s efforts to directly work with the child,\nthe child’s family and others related to the case service plan.\nTechnical assistance\nThe worker asking the relative caregiver to wait, not drive off while\nthe worker had direct contact with her supervisor to problem solve\nthis matter in the moment was advisable. It is recommended that\nthe agency provide additional instructions to workers around how\nto enhance problem solving in urgent situations.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code Change of placement.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12405\nSection (3) The agency shall document all the following in the child's\nDescription record before a change of placement occurs:\n(i) That the current foster parent was notified in writing of the\nfollowing:\n(i) Not less than 14 calendar days in advance, of the change,\nexcept when prior notification would jeopardize the child’s care or\n4",
    "safety. If prior notice is not provided, then the agency shall notify\nthe foster parent, at the time of the change, why prior notice was\nnot given.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency replaced the children without providing written notice\nto the foster parents.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nFoster Parent 1: On 7/18/2024 I interviewed Foster Parent 1 by\ntelephone. Foster Parent 1 reported Child A and Child B were\nremoved from her and her husband’s care without proper\nnotification. Foster Parent 1 reported they knew the children were\ngoing to be moved; that there was a 7/12/2024 FTM where it was\ndiscussed. She reported this was not a court ordered move, but\none that was at the agency’s discretion. She said the Children’s\nGAL (Guardian Ad Litem), Child A's therapist and the biological\nparent were not supportive of the move given that permanent\ncustody was being pursued and the length of time Child A and\nChild B had been in the home. Notwithstanding that, there was to\nbe a transition to take place related to the move that was to occur.\nThe children were to visit with Relative Caregiver on 7/14/2024\nand return to their foster home on 7/16/2024. An official move date\nwas set for 7/18/2024. Then the move was changed to 7/16/2024.\nFoster Parent 1 reported they did not appeal to the foster care\nreview board or ask for a meeting with the agency director about\ntheir placement change concerns. They did not because the\nworker and licensing supervisor explained the change of\nplacement was at the agency’s discretion and the agency director\nwas at the FTM. Foster Parent 1 reported they never received a\nwritten notice related to the replacement move.\nChief Administrator: I spoke with Chief Administrator (CA) about\nthis allegation by telephone on 7/19/2024. CA affirmed Foster\nParent 1’s reporting related to the FTM date, discussion about\nreplacement, and the visitation time frame for returning to the\nfoster home on 7/16/2024. She reported the FTM was the foster\nparent’s opportunity to mention concerns about the replacement,\nbut the foster parents did not. The foster parent brought up other\nconcerns about the children being in Relative Caregiver’s care\nwhich were addressed.\nCA reported the replacement move timeframe changed because\nof the outcome of their agency’s licensing department’s special\nevaluation on Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2. There had\nbeen allegations of maltreatment of the children by the foster\n5",
    "parents, and on 7/15/2024, the allegations were substantiated.\nRevocation of Foster Parent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s foster home\nlicense was the agency’s recommendation and based on that\nrecommendation, the agency determined returning the children to\nFoster Parent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s care would not be\nappropriate. CA reported the agency attempted a special\nevaluation preliminary findings summary with the foster parents on\n7/12/2024, but the foster parents did not answer. The worker\nadvised the foster parents of the agency’s special evaluation\nfindings and recommendation on 7/15/2023. The foster parents\nwere provided the DHS-30 via email on 7/15/2024.\nFoster Care Worker: On 7/25/2024 I interviewed Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) by telephone. FCW reported a relative placement\nwas already in progress prior to a complaint coming forth related\nto Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2. Relative Caregiver was\nidentified in early June 2024. FCW informed Foster Parent 1 and\nFoster Parent 2 of her search for relative caregivers for the\nchildren and she kept them informed of the progress of her\nrelative searches at each foster home visit, and at court hearings\nwhich Foster Parent 1 attended. FCW reported following the\nagency’s decision to move forward with Relative Caregiver for\nplacement of the children, an FTM was held on 7/12/2024 to\ndiscuss the replacement plans. FCW affirmed CA’s reporting\nrelated to the foster parent’s attending the FTM. FCW reported\nChild A’s and Child B’s replacement move was to be gradual. The\nboys were visiting with Relative Caregiver with a plan to return to\nthe foster home prior to an official move date, but after foster care\nreceived the outcome of a special evaluation on Foster Parent 1\nand Foster Parent 2 on 7/15/2024 with the recommendation of\nrevocation, the children’s replacement date was moved up to\n7/15/2024. FCW called Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 on\n7/15/2024 and informed them that the children would be officially\nplaced with Relative Caregiver and would not be returning to\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 from the visit with Relative\nCaregiver. The foster parents did not think the children should be\nmoved, but at that time they did not ask for an exact reason for the\nmove. FCW said the foster parents knew that the visit on\n7/16/2024 was to be a goodbye visit. On 7/15/2024 FCW emailed\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 the DHS-30-Foster\nParent/Caregiver Notice of Move for Child A and Child B. FCW\nprovided me a copy of each child’s DHS-30 and an email showing\nthe certified mail notice receipt for what FCW said was her mailing\nthe DHS-30 to Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2.\n6",
    "Supervisor: On 9/6/2024 I made a follow up telephone contact to\nthe agency at which time I interviewed Supervisor. Supervisor\naffirmed information as reported by CA and FCW related Child A\nand Child B’s replacement and the agency contact and notification\nto Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 related to the children’s\nreplacement.\nDocument Review.\nChild A’s and Child B’s MISACWIS case file which showed:\n• Child A and Child B are temporary court wards.\n• Child A was originally placed with Foster Parent 1 and\nFoster Parent 2 on 9/11/2020; and Child B was originally\nplaced with them on 12/1/2021.\n• Both children were replacement from Foster Parent 1’s and\nFoster Parent 2’s home on 3/30/2023 and then returned to\ntheir care on 4/21/2023 until 7/15/2023.\n• Child A and Child B were placed with Relative Caregiver on\n7/15/2024.\nCopy of a DHS-30 for Child A and Child B dated 7/15/2024:\n• Was addressed to Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2.\n• Advised these foster parents the department has reason to\nbelieve the child has suffered sexual maltreatment or non-\naccidental physical injury or there is a substantial risk of\nharm to the child’s well-being.\n• Advised these foster parents that they can appeal the\nrespective child’s move to the foster care review board.\nEmail from FCW which attached a certified mail receipt that was\naddressed to Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 from when\nFCW reported sending the DHS-30 to the foster parents by mail.\nCopy of a special evaluation report for Foster Parent 1 and Foster\nParent 2 dated 7/15/202 which showed:\n• A special evaluation intake allegation of sexual and\nphysical maltreatment; alleging the foster father bathed or\nshowered with Child A, the foster parents use corporal\npunishment, and that the foster parents are not providing\nproper care for the children in the home.\n• The special evaluation found the foster home in violation of\nthe allegations and revocation of the foster parents’ foster\nhome license was recommended.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence does\nnot support the allegations or that the foster parents were not\ngiven written notice of the children’s move and reason for the\nmove.\n7",
    "Conclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection (2) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster child, and\nDescription the foster parent, if applicable, in the child's placement at least\nonce every month.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The foster care worker did not make a monthly visit to the foster\nhome for the month of July 2024.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nFoster Parent 1: On 7/18/2024 I interviewed Foster Parent 1 by\ntelephone. Foster Parent 1 reported FCW did not make a July\n2024 monthly foster home visit. She said on 7/3/2024 she asked\nfor a foster home visit and FCW said they would schedule a home\nvisit. Foster Parent 1 said she texted FCW her availability on\n7/10/2024, but a foster home visit never occurred. Foster Parent\n1 admitted Child A and Child B were visiting Relative Caregiver in\nJuly and were replaced from their foster home on 7/15/2024.\nChief Administrator, FCW and Supervisor. I interviewed each\nstaff person separately by telephone on 7/19/2024, 7/25/2024,\nand 9/6/2024 respectively. Each of them denied the allegation.\nFCW reported there was no home visit with Foster Parent 1 and\nFoster Parent 2 in July due to Child A and Child B’s replacement\non 7/15/2024. FCW as well as CA and Supervisor reported FCW\nhad a monthly home visit with Child A, and Child B in their\nplacement with Relative Caregiver that complied with rule and\npolicy related to the worker’s monthly visitation with the respective\nchild and their caregiver.\nDocument Review:\nChild A’s and Child B’s MISAWIS case file which showed:\n• A 7/16/2024 social work contact for a home visit that\ndocumented a home visit with Child A, Child B and\nRelative Caregiver on that date.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed, the evidence does\nnot support the allegation or a missed monthly home visit by the\nworker with the child and the child’s caregiver.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n8",
