Youth A stated he got up\non his own after about a minute and he got back in Staff 1’s face,\nbut at that point the physical interaction between them ended.\nYouth B was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 01/04/2024\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility.

    "punches. Youth B stated he did not see much else between\nYouth A and Staff 1 because Staff 2 then attempted to restrain\nhim as a result of the physical aggression he was showing\ntowards Staff 1. Youth B stated he bit Staff 2 and tried to kick him\nwhile this occurred as a way to get out of the restraint, and Staff 2\nreleased him.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 01/24/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit at the facility. Staff 2\nrecalled the incident in question. He stated things escalated when\nYouth A and Youth B were outside of their bedrooms and had\nStaff 1 cornered in the common area of the unit. Staff 2\nimmediately recognized that the youth were either going to\nattempt to assault Staff 1 or try to steal his keys because of their\nposturing and what they were saying. Staff 2 recalled seeing\nYouth A punch Staff 1 in the face. Staff 2 could not recall exactly\nwhat happened next because he saw both Youth A and Youth B\nlunge at Staff 1, so he decided to attempt to restrain Youth B as\nhe was nearest to Staff 2. Staff 2 stated he had his hands on\nYouth B’s upper arms from behind while standing. Youth B then\nattempted to kick him and reached over and bit Staff 2’s hands.\nStaff 2 recalled letting go of Youth B at that point and moving\naway from him. Staff 2 stated he was able to see Youth A on the\nground with Staff 1 standing over top of him. Staff 2 believed that\nwas the last he saw of Staff 1 and Youth A interacting.

Staff 1 recalled the incident in question. He stated\neverything began with Youth A and Youth B escalating and\nrefusing to go to bed on the evening of 01/01/2024. Staff 1\nrecalled Youth A and Youth B talking to each other in hushed\ntones, and Staff 1 was concerned they were planning something.\nHe recalled Youth A attempting to pick the lock to the back exit\n3",
    "door of the unit with a belt, and Staff 1 was able to take that from\nYouth A without incident. Staff 1 stated Youth A and Youth B then\napproached him and Youth A asked for Staff 1’s keys. Youth A\nstated to Staff 1 he was going to “beat his ass.” Staff 1 recalled\nYouth A stated to Youth B “What you on? I’m on the same one\nyou on” and Staff 1 interpreted that as a planned attack on staff or\nan attempt to escape. Staff 1 recalled Youth B then throwing a\npunch at him, with Youth A then doing the same. Staff 1 stated he\npunched back and hit Youth A in the chest. He then recalled Staff\n2 going hands on with Youth B, and not seeing what occurred with\nthem following the restraint attempt. Staff 1 recalled Youth A\nfalling to the ground. Staff 1 believed he hit Youth A two or three\ntimes while taking punches back from him. Staff 1 recalled the\nsituation then quickly calmed down after Youth A got back up and\nhe stepped away from Youth A and Youth B. Staff 1 confirmed no\none had their hands on another person after that point.\nDuring a video conference held on 02/06/2024, DHHS Worker 1\nstated that their investigation would produce findings and Staff 1\nwould be confirmed.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Documentation was provided to show that Staff 1 was\nsuspended from employment as of 01/03/2024.\n• Documentation of staff training was provided and showed\nthat both Staff 1 and Staff 2 were fully certified in the\nrestraint model approved for the facility as of 11/09/2023.\n• No discipline was noted in either of Staff 1 or Staff 2’s\npersonnel file.\n• Two “Critical Incident Report” documents both dated\n01/02/2024 were provided. Both state that restraint holds\nwere used separately on Youth A and Youth B in the\ncourse of the youth attempting to assault staff.\n• Video footage from the evening of 01/01/2024 was\nprovided and reviewed. It was seen in this footage that the\nfire alarm had been set off and Youth A and Youth B were\noutside of their bedrooms. No other youth were seen in\nthis footage. Youth A, Youth B and Staff 1 are obscured\nfrom view while the incident occurred. These three\nindividuals were near the lower wall of the unit, which is\nwhere a door exiting the building is located. The camera\nthat best captured what occurred is mounted on that same\nwall. Staff 2 can be seen moving away from Youth A,\nYouth B and Staff 1 against that wall, and then moving\nquickly back toward them. The first instance of seeing Staff\n1 and Youth A engaged physically then occurred. Staff 3 is\n4",
    "seen to the right of Staff 2, who then backs up a few feet.\nStaff 1 was then seen over the top of Youth A as Youth A\nwas falling to the ground. Staff 1 appeared to punch down\nat Youth A multiple times. All the individuals involved are\nthen obscured from view again for 20 seconds. Staff 2 was\nthen seen moving away from everyone else and he flipped\na nearby chair and was visibly upset. Staff 3 was then\nseen standing and looking towards the other obscured\nindividuals and appeared calm.\no Time stamps were not available for the footage, but\nthe start time of approximately 11:16pm was\nconsistent with information provided by the Chief\nAdministrator and other documentation.\no Separate footage was provided from a security\ncamera on the opposite side of the common area of\nthe unit. Individuals can be seen physically engaged\nbut the footage was not clear enough, not close\nenough and somewhat obscured by a corner wall for\nmore detail to be determined.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation and\nvideo footage reviewed, there was evidence found to show a rule\nviolation in that Staff 1 punched back at Youth A during the\nescalated incident.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• More detail is needed in the writing of Incident Reports\nwhen describing escalated incidents and the use of\nphysical management.\nConsultation provided:\n• The facility was advised to consider the addition of one\nmore camera within the units that would allow for better\ncoverage of all areas of the unit.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms\nof intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(iii) Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or\notherwise suggesting physical or emotional harm\nto a youth.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\n5",

Youth A\nrecalled “getting in the face” of Staff 1 and asking for his keys.\nYouth A recalled Staff 1 saying “Get your bitch ass out of my face”\nin response. Youth A believed Staff 1 spit in his face when saying\nthis, but Youth A believed this was not on purpose but more of an\naccident because of how upset Staff 1 was getting. Youth A\nrecalled Staff 1 also stating “Swing on me again so I can beat your\nass again” after there were punches exchanged between them.\nYouth B was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 01/04/2024\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. Youth B\nrecalled Youth A and Staff 1 yelling at each other but could not\nremember exactly what was said. Youth B then stated he did hear\nStaff 1 state “Go ahead and swing on me so I can beat your ass”\nbefore any punches were thrown.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 01/24/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit at the facility. Staff 2\nheard both Youth A and Youth B say “You know what time it is”\nand “Take his keys.” Staff 2 recalled hearing Staff 1 state\nsomething to the effect of “Hold on guys, let’s calm down” in\nresponse. Staff 2 also heard Youth A threaten Staff 1.

Staff 1 recalled the incident in question. Staff 1 did not\nrecall much of what was said during the incident. He did recall\nstating to Youth A something to the effect of “If you run up on me\n…” and “Hit me if you want, something’s going to happen.” Staff 1\ndenied cussing at either Youth A or Youth B.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Facility policy titled “Employee Standards of Conduct and\nPerformance” was reviewed. In this policy it is stated that\n“Employees are forbidden from using excessive physical\nforce or verbal abuse of students.”\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff there was evidence to\nsupport a finding that Staff 1 used language that was threatening\nand suggested harm to the youth while interacting with them.\n6",
