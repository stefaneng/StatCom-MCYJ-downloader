    "INVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed the Program Director on 01/21/2022 regarding the allegation. She\nreported yes, the allegation is true. She said Adoption Worker 1 filed for subsidy on\n7/20/21, which the subsidy department provided initial subsidy agreement to\nAdoption Worker 1 as of 9/2/21. Following the subsidy agreement, it was provided to\nthe relative to sign, with initial technical issues, the signed agreement was provided\nto the Adoption Worker by the relative on 9/15/21. Adoption Worker 1 then uploaded\nthe email confirmation into MiSACWIS. However, the adoption worker inadvertently\ndid not upload the signed agreement or send the subsidy department an email to\nconfirm. She said this was later caught during the request for subsidy case opening.\nShe said Adoption Worker 1 filed the adoption petition on 9/15/21, through Monroe\nCounty Court’s Adoption Department and confirmed drop off via email. The Program\nDirector said after numerous email exchanges and getting documents signed a\nfinalization hearing was scheduled for 10/28/21. She said it wasn’t until the final\norders were received and the case closure process began that the error was\nidentified on 11/17/21.\nThe Program Director provided a guideline of what occurred that caused the\nallegation to occur. The guideline is as follows:\n7/20/20201; Subsidy Requested\n9/02/2021; Received and Sent Relative Subsidy Agreement to review and sign\n9/15/2021; Relative returned signed Subsidy Agreement / Worker Uploaded\nEmail Confirmation into MiSACWIS\n10/07/2021; OTR/OPC issued\n10/28/2021; Adoption Finalized\n11/11/2021; Adoption Case Opening Requested via email\n11/17/2021; Subsidy informed Adoption worker via email, signed initial subsidy\nagreements were not received by the Subsidy office and thus a final contract was\nnot issued\n11/17/2021; Adoption worker then immediately informed supervisor\n11/19/2021; Contacted subsidy office regarding the Issue\nThe Program Director said to rectify the issue with the assistance of the adoption\nsupervisor, program manager, and director of the agency multiple parties were\ncontacted to begin the process. First the adoption worker contacted the MDHHS\nfoster care worker to explain the issue in hopes of getting some assistance. The\nProgram Director said the adoptive mother was contacted the same day 11/17/21\nand informed of the issue. She said the next step were to contact the Lawyer\nGuardians Ad Litem (LGAL), Monroe County’s Special Prosecutor, and court’s\nadoption supervisor who were emailed on 11/19/21. She said Monroe County parities\nprovided direction and provided a motion to relieve the order on 11/23/21 and\n11/24/21. The Monroe Court scheduler then provided a court date on12/20/21. The\nProgram Director said the previous order of adoption was rescinded and the updated\norder of adoption was authorized for 12/20/21. Once the order of adoption was\n3",
    "received the adoption worker contacted subsidy department and uploaded\nappropriate documentation to request subsidy case opening. She said as soon as the\nerror was identified her agency began working on solving the issue immediately to\nget it rectified.\nI interviewed the Adoption Worker, Adoption Supervisor and Program Manager.\nThey had no additional information to add. However, the Program Director said the\nagency paid the adoptive parent the amount in subsidy that she would have received\nfrom the order terminating rights/order placing child (OTR/OPC) until the subsidy\ncontracts were finalized to assist in providing relief.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\nANALYSIS: Based on documentation of the case records and the interviews\nwith the Program Director who admitted that an error was made\non the agency behalf. The agency took full responsibility for the\nerror however, the agency failed to follow the responsibility of\nimplementing the sign contract for the adoption assistance\nprograms which cause the agency to rescind the previous order\nof adoption. Therefore, the agency is found in violation with this\nrule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4",
