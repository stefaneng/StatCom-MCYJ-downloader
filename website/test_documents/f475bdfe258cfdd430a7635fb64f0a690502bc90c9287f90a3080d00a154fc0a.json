TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Licensing renewals- The 3706 with a recommendation for renewal must not\nbe submitted to DCWL prior to the renewal reevaluation (4004) being\ncompleted, documenting the information that determined the\nrecommendation.\n The licensing reevaluation recommendation, 3706 and 3080 must have\nmatching recommendations regarding the number of children, age, gender,\nand characteristics.\n CPR/first aid dates should be tracked aside from annual/renewal reports, in\norder to identify those that expire in between reevaluations. This will allow the\nagency an opportunity to gather updated documentation prior to expiration.\n YAVFC youth that live on their own are considered Independent Living youth\nfor licensing rules. YAVFC is a legal status, IL is the placement type.\nTherefore, all IL requirements from the licensing rule book apply to YAVFC.\n Foster home visits- when completing the requirement for twice monthly face-\nto-face contacts with youth in a new placement, the worker must be sure to\ncomplete the contacts in a way that monthly home visit requirements are also\nmet.\n If a youth initiates the YAVFC process and a case is opened, but the youth\nstops communicating with the agency, the agency must document attempts to\ncomplete required items until case closure. For example, the agency must\ndocument attempts to complete home visits, monthly budgets, 90-day IL\ncontract reviews, etc.\nV.

    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nOne investigation was initiated after an allegation the foster father yelled at and\ngrabbed a foster child around the neck five times and pushed her head into her\nsister’s head on purpose. Upon investigation, the foster family was found in violation\nof rule 9404(3) behavior management, due to the foster father admitting he put his\nhand on the back of the child’s neck to guide her to time-out. The corrective action\nplan included the training “Novel approaches for handling your oppositional child”.\nThe CAP was completed on 5/14/21.\nOne investigation was initiated after an allegation the foster parent spanked a foster\nchild one time, about a year ago. Upon investigation, the foster parent was found in\nviolation of rule 9404(3) behavior management, due to the foster parent admitting\nshe spanked the foster child once in 2020. The CAP included training on trauma\ninformed parenting and behavioral health therapy. The CAP was completed on\n6/30/21.\nBoth investigation reports were reviewed and found to meet licensing requirements.\nThe agency completed thorough investigations and developed appropriate CAPs\nwith timely follow-through. There have been no further concerns regarding these\nfoster families since the time of these investigations.\nThe agency has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP, approved 1/14/21, was developed as a result of the 1/12/21 renewal review.\nThe review determined eleven violations of licensing rules and DHHS contract.\nDuring this interim review fourteen violations were found, including seven repeat\nviolations. Partial compliance with the CAP was determined. During the exit\nconference the agency reported the violations regarding independent living was due\nto the agency misunderstanding the rules regarding IL and YAVFC. Technical\nAssistance was provided and improvement in this area is anticipated during the next\nreporting period.\nA CAP, approved 4/15/21, was developed as the result of an investigation\n(2021C0102013) in which it was determined the agency did not complete a special\nevaluation in 2020 as required (Rule 400.12327), failed to assess an adult\nhousehold member in a foster home (Rule 400. 12206), and allowed an adult\nhousehold member on central registry to reside in a licensed foster home\n(722.115q). The CAP included additional training, increased staff supervision, and\n9",
    "review of foster home members. The CAP was implemented by the agency and no\nfurther concerns have been reported.\nA CAP, approved 8/6/21, was developed as the result of an investigation\n(2021C0116037) in which it was determined that relative home studies were not\ncompleted timely (FOM 722-03B). The CAP included review of policy, updated\ninternal forms, and additional training. The CAP was implemented by the agency\nand no further concerns have been reported.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nDuring the on-site visit the Chief Administrator Assessment was discussed with the\nChief Administrator (CA). The CA reported the agency has had staffing challenges\nover this past year, which has impacted timeliness of work. Staff have been working\na combination of remotely and in the office. Caseloads have been steady, and they\ncontinue to have positive relationships with the referring counties. The CA indicated\nthe corrective action plan from last year has been implemented, although ongoing\nCOVID restrictions and staffing vacancies caused challenges in some areas.\nHowever, the CA felt the agency has performed well overall.\nInterviews\nTwo foster care staff were interviewed on-site. One staff reported being new to case\nmanagement, after prior experience working in a residential facility. The worker\nreported enjoying the scope of the work and stated the agency and co-workers are\nvery helpful and supportive. The second staff reported being a case manager for\napproximately one year. The worker stated she enjoys working with families,\nalthough it can be challenging at times. The worker indicated the flexible schedule,\nsupportive team, and helpful supervision are appreciated. No concerns about the\nagency were reported.\nVII. DCWL FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified two safety concerns as follows:\nSafety Alert #1: A hot water heater was located in the closet of one of the bedrooms\nin an unlicensed relative home. This room is occupied by the relative caregiver. A\nmattress was found in the closet, leaning against the hot water heater.\nResolution: The family moved the mattress from the closet and placed a baby gate at\nthe closet door to prevent the children from accessing the water heater. Photos were\nuploaded into the caregiver record in MiSACWIS.\nSafety Alert #2: The foster parents were utilizing a loft space as a bedroom.\nAlthough the family denied using the space for sleeping, a bed was observed in the\nloft.\nResolution: The family enclosed the room by installing wood paneling over the open\nwall area and making the room fully enclosed. Photos were uploaded into MiSACWIS\n10",
    "under the foster family’s record. The family then transferred their license to another\nagency.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n_ _________________February 8, 2022____________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 16, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"
