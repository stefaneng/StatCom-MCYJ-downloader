    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation While restraining Youth N on 2/13/24 Staff 1 intentionally stepped\non Youth N's foot and scratched her face drawing blood.\nInvestigation Video\nVideo shows Staff 2 guiding Youth N down a hallway. Another\ncamera shows Youth N charge at Staff 2 attempting to push past\nher into an undesignated area. Youth N repeatedly kicks a door\nleading to offices. A third camera shows Staff 1 and Staff 2 with\nYouth N in a two-person standing control hold. Youth N is\nstruggling and hitting Staff 1. The restraint moves out of the\ncamera’s view and continues for another minute. Staff 3\napproaches and appears to try to verbally de-escalate the youth\nwhile Staff 1 and Staff 2 are holding her. Staff 3 appears to switch\nout with Staff 1 and Staff 1 leaves the area. Staff 2 and Staff 3\ncome into the camera’s view struggling to immobilize Youth N\nusing the two-person control hold. Staff 1 returns to the area to\nassist them. Youth N moves the staff to the center of the room\nand drops to a sitting position behind furniture. Staff 1, Staff 2 and\nStaff 3 continue holding her limbs. Youth N has ahold of Staff 1’s\nbraids. Staff 1 gets free. Youth N pushes herself back to a lying\nposition on the floor and kicks up at Staff 2 and Staff 3. Staff 5\nenters the room. Staff 2 bends over Youth N’s torso and\nreengages holding her arms while Staff 3 grabs and holds each of\nYouth N’s feet to the floor. Staff 5 eventually switches with Staff 3\nand holds the youth’s ankles up from the floor. Video does not\nshow Staff 1 scratching Youth N’s face or stepping on her foot.\nDocuments reviewed:\nAssessment by Nurse 1 on 2/13/24 indicated “per youth she was\nphysically managed after assaulting a staff member…Youth has\nseveral superficial scratches to her face. 3-inch scratch to Left\n2",
    "cheek, 3-inch scratch to right side of nose, and 1 inch scratch to\nRight side of cheek. Writer cleansed areas with antiseptic and\napplied bacitracin to scraped areas youth tolerated well. youth\ndenied any other injuries currently. Writer checked arms, back and\ntorso area, all negative for injury. Youth was very upset during\nassessment, was on the phone speaking with family and tearful,\nWriter offered youth 10mg PRN Thorazine which youth accepted.\nYouth also took Motrin for pain and stiffness and refused ice pack.\nWriter informed unit manager youth’s injuries.”\nA photo of Youth N’s face taken by Government Worker 1 on\n2/15/24 showed the following:\n• One 1-inch scratch on her lower right jaw.\n• One 1 ½- inch scratch on her right nostril.\n• One 1-inch scratch on her lower left cheek.\n• One ½ -inch healing scratch above her right upper lip.\n• One 1-inch red mark left of her nose.\nAn incident report spanning over an hour on 02/13/24 indicated\nYouth N became belligerent, was kicking a door and would not\nrespond to verbal de-escalation by staff. She kicked Staff 2 and\npunched Staff 1 in the face. Youth N was physically restrained for\none minute. Once released, she ran to Staff 1 and struck her\nagain multiple times in the face. Efforts to escort her failed. Youth\nN then hit Staff 2 in the face and fell to the floor kicking, spitting,\nbiting and punching her. Another attempt to physically manage\nher failed after one minute. Staff 2 directed Staff 1 to leave the\narea…Staff 4 stepped onto the wing…Youth N reported scratches\non her face. Staff 2 had a bruise and two bite marks on her hand.\nNurse was notified.\nA body chart completed on 2/11/24 indicated Youth N had a\nscratch to the right side of her nose. A body chart completed after\nthis incident on 2/13/24 indicated in addition to the scratch\ndetected on 2/11/24, Youth N had four new scratches on her face.\nStaff 1’s disciplinary write-ups include a verbal warning on\n12/20/22, written warning on 1/24/23, counseling memo on\n2/15/23 and violation of policy on 5/23/23. Only the verbal\nwarning on 12/20/22 involved a client-related issue.\nInterviews\nComplainant/Therapist reported this allegation on behalf of Youth\nN. She did not witness the incident and had no additional\ninformation.\n3",
    "I notified Youth N’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation\nassignment, and she expressed no additional concerns.\nI interviewed Youth N jointly with Government Worker 1 on\n2/15/24. She has been at the facility for nine months. Youth N\npresented with vertical superficial scratches on her right lower\ncheek, nose and left cheek. She said a nurse applied ointment to\nher scratches and told her they would heal. Youth N stated she\ndid not have her foot checked out insisting “Nothing’s wrong with\nit. It’s just a scratch on a toe.” With encouragement, Youth N\nallowed Government Worker 1 to photograph her face but refused\nto show us her foot.\nYouth N said Staff 1 caused the injuries and intentionally\nscratched her after Youth N hit Staff 1 in her face or head. Staff\ncleared the area of other youths and restrained her. “Staff 1 was\nsaying stuff to me while I was being restrained…She (Staff 1) put\nher hand over my face and mouth and stepped on my foot.”\nYouth N explained Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 4 and Staff 5 restricted\nher movement in different ways. “Staff 2 and Staff 4 were on each\nside. I sat down so they’d let me go. Staff 5 held my feet down.\nThey let go and I walked somewhere else.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer via Teams on 3/5/24. Staff 2 is a team leader with 12\nyears of experience working in child caring institutions. She was\nlast trained in CPI in November 2023. Staff 2 recalled the incident\non 2/13/24. She said Youth N was kicking a door and she and\nStaff 1 tried to verbally de-escalate her. “Youth N punched me\nand Staff 1.” In response Staff 1 and Staff 2 attempted to put her\nin a two-person control hold for one minute but were unsuccessful\nbecause Youth N was struggling and hitting. “We got her into a\nproper hold. She dropped and sat on the floor. Staff 1 and I\ndisengaged. Youth N punched Staff 1 in the face and held onto\nher hair. I tried to get her to release, but she had a good grip.\nOnce Youth N released Staff 1’s hair, she kicked me and Staff 1’s\nlegs. Staff 1 and I put her in another two-person control hold for\nless than one minute. Youth N fell to the floor and we\ndisengaged. Staff 3 arrived and assisted removing Staff 1\nbecause I felt like Staff 1 was a target since Youth H had punched\nher and pulled her hair.”\nStaff 2 denied seeing Staff 1 intentionally step on Youth N’s foot. I\nasked Staff 2 if Youth N spit at Staff 1. She said she did, but she\ndid not see Staff 1 scratch the youth or rub the spit in her face. “I\ndid see scratches on Youth N’s face after but I knew she was in a\n4",
    "physical management the day before.” Staff 2 did not recall Staff\n5 responding at the scene or holding Youth N’s feet as seen in the\nvideo.\nI interviewed Staff 4 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present on 2/15/24. Government Worker 1 read the\nallegation aloud. Staff 4 has worked at the facility for nine months.\nWhen he arrived on the wing, he said Youth N was hitting doors\nand had scratches on her face. “Youth N walked up and grabbed\nonto Staff 2’s hands. Youth N pulled her own hair and me and\nStaff 2 stopped her, using the two-person control hold. Youth N\nsat on the floor, kicked walls and pulled her own hair. She did not\npull staff’s hair.” Staff 2 said he did write an incident report and\ndid not notice any of the staff do anything inappropriate.\nI interviewed Staff 5 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present. She has worked at the facility for ten months and\nwas last trained in CPI in July 2023. Staff 5 recalled Youth N\nscreaming and kicking Staff 3. “Staff 2 and 3 were trying to\nrestrain her. Youth N hit, bit and kicked. She bit Staff 2 on the\nhand. I tried to restrain her legs. She was still on the floor. I\nstopped her legs from kicking. Youth N got up, rand around and\nwent after Staff 1. They had Staff 1 get off the wing. Youth N\nalready had scratches on her face. Youth N grabbed her own hair\nbegging to go into her therapist’s office…I don’t know anything\nabout her foot.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 on 2/23/24\nwith Rights Officer present. She has worked at the facility for 18\nmonths and was last trained in CPI in July 2023. Staff 1 said\nYouth N became belligerent and would not respond to Staff 2’s\ndirections. “Staff 2 attempted to restrain her. I tried to de-\nescalate. Youth N reached across and hit my shoulder. I stepped\nnext to Staff 2 and tried to restrain Youth N. Youth N spit in my\nhand and I grabbed her face. She struggled away from my hand.\nShe broke every single nail on my hand. That is how her face got\nscratched. I never reached for her or attacked her…We never\nrestrained her successfully. Staff 3 came. Youth N was furious\nand focused on me. I walked off the wing.”\nStaff 1 was uncertain if Youth N fell to the floor or if she stepped\non Youth N’s foot. “It was very bad for her to spit. I know I\ngrabbed her mouth for a matter of seconds.” Staff 1 demonstrated\nhow she placed her full open hand over Youth N’s mouth and\nface. I asked about the protocol for responding to a youth spitting.\nStaff 1 did not know. Rights Officer indicated that when readily\n5",
    "available, staff may use a towel or cushion to shield themselves\nfrom being spit on. He said face shields are also available for use\nwith youths who are known to spit.\nGovernment Worker 1 deemed Staff 1 unsuitable to work with\nchildren.\nAnalysis In response to Youth N spitting on her, Staff 1 admitted she\ngrabbed Youth N’s face, covered her face and mouth with her\nhand and scratched her breaking all of her fingernails. There is no\nevidence Staff 1 intentionally injured or stepped on the youth’s\nfoot.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Behavior management\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4157\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures that describe the institution’s behavior management\nsystem. The policies and procedures shall be reviewed annually\nand updated as needed. These shall be available to all residents,\ntheir families, and referring agencies.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff used improper techniques when restraining Youth N.\nInvestigation Video\nYouth N moves the staff to the center of the room and drops to a\nsitting position behind furniture. Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3\ncontinue holding her limbs…Youth N pushes herself back to a\nlying position on the floor…Staff 2 bends over Youth N’s torso and\nreengages holding her arms while Staff 3 grabs and holds each of\nYouth N’s feet to the floor. Staff 5 eventually switches with Staff 3\nand holds the youth’s ankles up from the floor.\nDocument reviewed\nI reviewed the CPI restraint moves used and approved by the\nfacility. No move involves staff restraining any part of a youth’s\nbody when the youth is sitting or lying on the floor.\nInterview\n6",
    "Staff 5 admitted she restrained Youth N’s legs to stop her from\nkicking on the floor.\nAnalysis Holding any part of a youth’s body when she is sitting or lying on\nthe floor are not restraint moves described in the institution’s\nbehavior management system.\nVideo shows Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3 continued holding her\nlimbs after Youth N dropped to a sitting position. She transitioned\ninto a lying position and Staff 2 continued holding her upper body\nwhile Staff 3 held her ankles to the floor and Staff 5 subsequently\nheld her ankles up from the floor.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
