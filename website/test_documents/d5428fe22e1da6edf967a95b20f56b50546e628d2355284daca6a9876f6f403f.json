    "neglect. The documentation shall be\ncompleted not more than 30 days prior to\nthe start of employment and every 12\nmonths thereafter.\nTen of ten new employees did not have a CWL-4624 run prior to hire. All ten\nemployees had a CWL-1910 record in their employee file, but this does not meet\nthe CRC requirement established in November 2022. In addition, two of the ten\nnew employees had their central registry checks completed over 30 days prior to\nhire. One new employee was hired on 10/30/23, but the CWL-1910 was completed\non 9/19/23. Another new employee was hired on 1/9/23, but the CWL-1920 was\ncompleted on 12/1/22.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance regarding the process and timeframes for\ncompletion of central registry requests for staff prior to hire and annually. The facility\nwas provided the CWL-4624, FAQ, communication issuances and an email explanation\nto assist the facility in developing an appropriate process.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe first CAP was approved on 12/8/22 and was a result of a violation found in SIR\n2023C0000009 dated 11/17/22. The facility demonstrated compliance with their\nCAP by implementing increased supervision procedures for youth, increased\ntraining for staff, increased support for staff, and ongoing conversations about\nyouth supervision in individual supervision meetings as well as team meetings.\nThe second CAP was approved on 12/14/22 and was a result of violations found in\nthe facility's Renewal Inspection Report approved on 11/29/22. The facility\ndemonstrated full compliance with their CAP by having youth/families sign\nverification they were provided the grievance policy during intake, and tracking to\nensure youth will receive an initial physical exam if they reside at the facility for\nmore than 21 days.\n3",
    "Financial Overview\nThe facility's financial audit and budget were reviewed. There were no concerns\nnoted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted the facility has been in substantial compliance with\nDHHS licensing rules. CA reported they fully implemented both of their CAPs\nduring the period of review, and successfully completed both. CA noted unplanned\ndischarges continue to be difficult to assess due to the voluntary nature of the\nprogram. CA reported the leadership team and programming staff will continue to\nconduct quarterly chart audits, program inspections, and team meetings to review\nand ensure continued compliance with licensing rules.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported their coworkers, management and the youth are\nawesome. They reported they love there's something new and different every day.\nThey love the opportunity to make a positive impact on youths' lives in such a short\nperiod of time. They reported they were without a supervisor for a year, and\nalthough the Chief Administrator and Clinical Manager did an amazing job\nsupporting and training them, they like that they have a supervisor and feel there's\na chain of command in place now. Staff reported support and training has\nsignificantly improved over the last year, which has made everyone feel more\ncomfortable with their duties and has made them closer as a \"work family\". Staff\nreported they are in the process of creating a new training guide, which will be\nmore hands-on and will make onboarding new staff more effective and efficient.\nStaff reported recently the facility changed staff schedules around so there is now\none full-time staff member on each shift, which provides more consistency and\nstructure. Staff reported everyone is working hard and teaming together to build the\nprogram to the best it can be. Staff reported another big improvement has been an\nincrease in youth accountability and responsibility. Staff reported a few areas of\ncontinued growth and improvement include continuing to empower staff to make\ndecisions independently, continue to work on and train de-escalation skills, and\nhiring more staff members for swing shifts.\nYouth interviewed reported they love staying at The Bridge because it is amazing.\nThey reported the facility is not strict, but it is structured, which is really nice. They\nreported the staff are awesome, very supportive, and very nice. They reported they\nenjoy having house meetings, and feel any issues brought up during those\nmeetings, or outside of those meetings, are addressed timely and thoroughly. They\nalso reported the meals are amazing and the facility is always clean.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\n4",

RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nNovember 14. 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 15, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
