A staff member\nfrom the facility arrived seven hours after the youth had already been at the hospital.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/15/2021 I reviewed the complaint that indicated:\n On 1/6/2021 Youth A (age 16) conducted research on how many pills she\ncould take before she dies.\n Youth A took 30 antidepressant pills.\n Youth A arrived at the hospital and agency staff arrived seven hours later.\nOn 1/15/2021, I interviewed the complainant by telephone. The Complainant\nreported Youth A messengered her at 1:42am on 1/7/2021 to say she was in the\nhospital. The Complainant reported Youth A had broken up with her boyfriend\nWednesday night (1/6/2021) and was upset about that. She reported the boyfriend\nhad seen something alarming about Youth A on snapchat and called the police.\nThe police conducted a safety check to the Samaritas Independent Living (IL) Plus\nhome. Once the police were at the home, Youth A admitted to taking pills and was\ntransported to the hospital by ambulance. The Complainant reported not being able\nto reach the IL-Plus staff and so she drove one and half hours to the hospital to be\nwith Youth A. Youth A reported the IL-Plus staff did not know she had taken the\nmedication. Youth A had not wanted to leave her room. Youth A had the medication\nin her room; it had not been locked up. Youth A said she took a number of her\nantidepressant pills; but Youth A was not certain of how many. Thirty was indicated\nbased on Youth A’s reporting and Youth A’s pill bottle count. Youth A was\ndischarged from the hospital to White Pines on1/7/2021 for assessment. Youth A\nwas released from White Pines on 1/12/2021 and returned to the Samaritas IL\nplacement.\nThe Complainant expressed concern the IL-Plus staff had not timely responded to\nher calls and showed up late to the hospital. Also, that the agency should have been\naware of Youth A’s depression and suicidal tendency. Additionally, that the agency\nhas not developed a safety plan for Youth A since this incident.\n3",
    "On 1/20/2021 and 1/21/2021, I spoke with the IL Plus- Manager 1 by telephone. He\nacknowledged Youth A was admitted to the hospital on 1/6/2021. He said the staff\ncontacted him at 3:30am to report the police visited the home and took Youth A to\nthe hospital for suicidal ideations. The midnight staff on shift spoke with the police.\nIL Plus- Home Manager 1 said the staff on shift in the home could not accompany\nYouth A to the hospital because she had other youths in the home to supervise. He\nsaid, Staff 3 followed up with the hospital to affirm that Youth A was ok.\nIL- Plus Home Manager 1 reported Youth A was placed in the home, after Christmas\non, 12/28/2020. He advised the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)\nwas quick to have Youth A participate in the program. He reported Samaritas did not\nknow Youth A had suicidal ideation. That information was not verbally relayed to\nthem; and he did not recall seeing that information in her referral package\n(consisting of her service plans; the referring worker’s assessment form and worker\nreferral sheet). He reported the agency does not routinely lock up independent\nyouths’ medications. The only time that would occur is if, the worker informed them\nthere is a need, the youth self-reports a need, or after some time interacting with the\nyouth, they discover a concern that the youth need assistance. IL- Plus Home\nManager 1 advised that all the IL youths sign a medication agreement apprising the\nyouth of their responsibilities related to their medication. He provided a copy of the\nmedication agreement for Youth A, which indicated:\n Youth A will follow the prescribing doctor and medication dosage.\n Youth A will not stop, change, or alter the dosage of any prescribed\nmedication without consulting the prescribing doctor and informing the IL\nPlus-Coordinator of the change.\n Youth A agrees to cooperate with the case plan, including administration,\nmonitoring and proper disposal (in consultation with a pharmacist) of all\nmedication for her.\n Youth A agrees to discuss any questions and or concerns regarding their\nmedication with their physician and case worker.\n At no time will Youth A begin, stop, or alter the dosage of any medication or\npervert its use without written documentation from the monitoring physician.\nAny written documentation has to be shared with the agency.\n Youth A and Staff 3 signed the medication agreement on 12/28/2020.\nIL- Plus Home Manager 1 reported if they knew Youth A had suicidal ideation, they\nwould have made plans to address it. He said, a youth can communicate a\nneed/concern/problem to him, the on-shift staff, or the IL-Coordinator at any time.\nHe, said, his and the IL-Coordinator’s contact numbers are posted in the home.\nAdditionally, there is a house phone, cell phone and lab top computer available for\nstaff and youth to use, if they need to contact them. He reported prior to Youth A’s\nreturn to the home he contacted Youth A’s DHHS Worker about the specifics of\nYouth A’s case and safety planning. There was a team’s meeting to discuss how to\ntransition Youth A back to the IL-Plus home, and how the team could help support\nher. Youth A discussed the skills she learned at White Pines and how she will utilize\nthose at the IL- Plus home. IL- Plus Home Manager 1 reported, they will be locking\n4",
    "up Youth A’s medication going forward and assisting her with medication\nadministration. Youth A has acknowledged that she understood why her medications\nhad to be locked up. Youth A would have to seek out a staff each morning to take\nher medication for the day.\nIL-Plus Manager 1 reported the following Safety Steps for Youth A by way of email:\n Staff will keep all Youth A’s medication locked in the staff’s desk.\n Youth A will continue to use her support system when she feels like there\nis a concern regarding her mental health; and communicate with the IL-\nPlus case worker.\n DHHS will contact New Oakland for referral for day treatment mental\nhealth services for Youth A.\n IL-Plus Case worker was going to follow up with Youth A’s school to make\nsure she is able to continue online.\n IL-Plus staff will monitor Youth A’s emotional stability during their shift and\nwill contact the case worker if Youth A starts having mental health issues.\nDue to COVID- I interviewed Youth A by telephone on 1/21/2021. Youth A (age 17)\nreported being at the IL- plus program since 12/27/220. When she came to the IL-\nplus program the rules were explained to her. One of the rules related to\nmedication, which was that “I’m responsible for taking my own medication”. Youth\nA admitted to taking more of her antidepressant medication than she was supposed\nto. She reported, she was depressed the day of the incident and wanted to visit\nfamily. She said, Staff 3, the IL Coordinator told her an overnight visit with family\nwas not an option because her family was in Midland, and she (Youth A) had not\nbeen in the program for 30 -days. Youth A said, then she was having a conversation\nwith her aunt and “something (what Youth A did not report) set her off. She became\nmore stressed. Youth A said, she did not let the on-shift staff person, know she\nwas experiencing high stress or dealing with emotional issues. Youth A said, she\nhad let Staff 3 know about her past mental health issues. She said, she is also in\ncounseling; and she had spoken with her counselor, via zoom that day. She told the\ncounselor she was okay. Youth A said as time went on, she got more stressed, but\ndid not mention that to the on-shift staff, Staff 2. She did not really want to talk to\nanyone. Her stress increased and she took the pills. She was posting on social\nmedia about her stress but did not say she wanted to kill herself or was or had taken\npills. Nor did she reach out to her counselor, facility staff or the other three residents\nto let them know what was happening with her, because it was after midnight. She\ndid not know how or who notified the police. When the police arrived, she admitted\ntaking pills; and they took her to Hurley hospital. Staff 2 found out about the incident\nafter the police came and got her. Staff 2 stayed at the house because the other\ngirls were there. Youth A was not sure if Staff 2 contacted the agency administrators\nabout the incident.\nYouth A reported telling the hospital she did not know how many pills she took. The\nhospital estimated she took 30-day pills because none were left in the bottle. Youth\nA did not know the normal capacity count for her pill bottle. She reported at some-\n5",
    "point she contacted her YIT (Youth in Transition) worker and told her she took the\npills. Youth A said she stayed overnight at Hurley hospital. Thereafter, she went to\nWhite Pines for psychiatric assessment. She stayed at White Pines for six-days.\nYouth A reported, other than, perhaps allowing her to go home, there was nothing\nthe agency could have done to have prevented the incident.\nOn 1/20/2021 I interviewed Staff 2 by telephone. Staff 2 reported being the midnight\n(11:00pm- 7:00am) staff on shift the night of the incident. Youth A, and three other\nresidents were in the house. Staff 2 reported being surprised when the police\narrived between 1:00am and 2:00am and asked for Youth A by name. The police\nreported they had received a call from a friend of Youth A’s. That Youth A had\nposted on social media Youth A wanted to hurt herself. Staff 2 said, prior to the\npolice arriving, she had no knowledge anything was wrong. Youth A had not come\nout of her room, nor reported a concern. Staff 2 reported when she arrived at the IL-\nPlus house, the youths are normally in bed during her/the midnight shift. If a youth is\nawake, their conversation with her is brief. She alerts the youths when she comes\non shift by knocking on each youth’s door. If the youth does not respond, she opens\ntheir door and looks in. Youth A did not answer the door knock that night, so Staff 2\nlooked into Youth A’s room. Youth A appeared to be asleep. Staff 2 said, after the\npolice arrived and she went upstairs to check on Youth A. Youth A said she was ok.\nYouth A was oriented, did not appear over medicated, just sleepy. Youth A told the\npolice she was okay. Youth A was told if she felt depressed or something, the police\ncould take her to the hospital. Youth A said ok, and the police took Youth A to the\nhospital. Staff 2 ensured that Youth A had the staff contact numbers to take with her\nShe also asked Youth A whether Youth A had any medications and to take it\nbecause the hospital asks for things like that. Staff 2 said at that time she did not\nknow Youth A was on antidepression medication.\nStaff 2 reported, it was not unusual for youths diagnosed with depression, or who\ntake medications to be in placement at the IL- Plus home. Nor was it unusual for\nstaff to assist a youth with administration of their medication, if needed. It’s a case-\nby-case situation with the youth’s case manager making that decision. The staff\nwould lock the medication and assist the youth by taking out/assuring one pill at a\ntime is taken. If Staff 2 were to awaken/remind the youth about taking their\nmedication, the prior shift staff would let her know. If the youth would not take their\nmedication, Staff 2 would let the next shift-staff know that. Staff 2 reported\ninformation about a youth’s specific needs/concerns is discussed at group\nchats/meetings, but she was not aware of specific concerns with Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported prior to the police departing she advised them of the Samaritas\nprogram type and that someone would follow up with the hospital. Staff 2 contacted\nIL-Plus Manager 1 and Staff 3 about the incident. The next morning, someone from\nHurley hospital called the office and reported on the status of Youth A.\n6",
    "On 1/22/2021, I interviewed Staff 3, the IL Coordinator, by telephone. Staff 3 was\nnot onsite the night of the incident. Staff 2 texted her about incident around 2:20am\nindicating Youth A was taken to the hospital by the police for suicidal ideation.\nStaff 3 reported seeing Youth A, three times that week, Monday, Tuesday, and the\nWednesday before the incident. Youth A was happy, cheerful, and showed no signs\nof being upset. Youth A reported missing her family. They discussed that Youth A\ngot to see family for the new year, on a holiday pass. They talked about Youth A\ngetting a weekend overnight pass when two-three weeks had passed. Staff 3\nadvised youths normally must be in the program 30-days prior to such, but she can\nadjust that at about three weeks. Day visits are permissible, but Youth A\nacknowledged that would be difficult given that her family members live so far away\n(Midland).\nStaff 3 reported completing Youth A’s intake into the program, but not seeing Youth\nA’s actual referral package. No medication administration concerns, or suicidal\nissues/history were reported by the DHHS Worker (Worker X), nor by Youth A when\nStaff 3 spoke with Youth A. Staff 3 said when she spoke with Youth A’s worker\nregarding the intake, Worker X advised Staff 3 of Youth A’s diagnosis of depression,\ntwice weekly therapy via Zoom, and therapist. Services with the named therapist\ncontinued; and medication reviews/prescription needs would be followed up by way\nof and Hope Network in Flint. Worker X advised that Youth A was taking her\nmedication on her own.\nStaff 3 reported after Staff 2 apprised her of Youth A’s hospital transport, she\nadvised Staff 2, she (Staff 3) or IL- Plus Home Manager 1 would go to the hospital in\nthe morning. That Youth A should be ok until then. Staff 3 acknowledged that Youth\nA’s, YIT worker had contacted her. The YIT worker left a voice message on Staff 3’s\nwork phone. Staff 3 received that message after Staff 2 had contacted her via her\n(Staff 3’s) personal cell phone. Staff 3 said she went to the hospital at 8:30am.\nHurley hospital staff would not allow her to see Youth A because the YIT worker was\nwith her. Staff 3 tried a couple of times to explain her role. The hospital contacted\nthe social worker. The hospital social worker thought her to be aggressive given her\npersistence, so Staff 3 left and make contact with the agency and Youth A’s DHHS\nworker.\nOn 1/28/2021, I interviewed Youth B and Youth C by telephone. I interviewed Youth\nD by telephone on 1/29/2021. The youths knew or had heard the police took Youth\nA to the hospital. Neither had specific information about the incident.\nReviewed:\nInformation as reported earlier in this report.\nYouth A’s intake package (intake checklist dated 12/21/2020 asking for information,\nreports) referral form completed by Worker X dated 12/18/2020; and Caregiver\nAssessment completed by the caregiver and Worker X dated 12/21/2020.\n7",
    "The latter two documents contained information that indicated:\n Youth A had gone through a lot in her life but still she has a good attitude and\ndrive about her future and her circumstances.\n Youth A has proven that she is ready to be independent.\n She may struggle with things throughout the day, but with the help she is\nreceiving she will be alright.\n The caregiver is open to staying involved.\n Youth A “has some issues emotionally and mentally but she has good coping\nskills and does well with coping”.\n Youth A needs to be held accountable, but she is a good kid and will listen.\n Youth A’s current medication is Fluoxetine (used to treat depression).\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12505 Supervision.\n(1) An agency shall provide supervision for a youth in\nindependent living consistent with the youth's need for\nsupervision, as required by R 400.12504(2)(e).\nANALYSIS: The evidence does not support a lack of supervision.\nYouth A appeared happy and cheerful earlier in the day. She\ndid not report feeling stressed or depressed to the staff. The\nstaff did not have knowledge she was experiencing suicidal\nthoughts. Nor that she had problems taking her medications\ncorrectively or would abuse it. Once the agency was alerted by\nthe police, the staff encouraged the youth’s transport to the\nhospital, attempted to check on her the next morning and\nworked with her worker on a safety and medication\nadministration plan prior to her return to the IL-home from her\nsix-day psychiatric facility stay.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nDuring the investigation it was revealed staff were sleeping on their shift and leaving\nresidents in the home without notifying the residents the staff had left the home.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/20/2021, I interviewed Youth A by telephone. Youth A reported the night of her\nincident on 1/6/2021, she went downstair around 11:30pm. Staff 2 was sleeping on\nthe couch. Staff 2 did not know she was present. Staff 2 was snoring. Youth A went\nback upstairs.\n8",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed by me via telephone on 1/20/2021. Staff 2 denied the\nallegations. She admitted sitting in the staff’s room after checking on the youths, but\nnot sleeping on the couch. She said if a youth was to come downstair, the youth\ncannot she her on the couch. They would have to actually come into the living room\nto see her; but she has never taken a nap on the job.\nYouth B and Youth C were interviewed by me via telephone on 1/28/2021.\nYouth B reported the staff that sleeps on the job is Staff 5 and Staff 2. Youth B did\nnot recall Staff 2 sleeping on the job the night the ambulance came for Youth A but\nsaid Staff 2 was sleeping on the couch most recently one day last week (from\n1/28/2021). Youth B did not give specific times when Staff 5 was sleeping but said\nStaff 5 can be rude. Youth B reported finding Staff 2 asleep at times that she (Youth\nB) goes down to take her medication. Youth B said she hates to wake Staff 2 up.\nShe reported knowing Staff 2 is sleeping because, first, she (Youth B) waves her\nhands near Staff 2; and when she gets no response, she raises her voice. Youth B\nreported this has occurred many times.\nYouth C reported she normally does not interact with or ask the midnight staff for\nanything. She basically sees those staff if she goes downstairs. She reported\nobserving Staff 2, and Staff 5 sleeping on their shifts. She said, Staff 5 normally\nworks the afternoon or morning shift; and Staff 5 often sleeps on her shift. She said,\nStaff 2 comes to work usually when they are in bed and she has seen Staff 2\nsleeping on the couch on more than one occasion. Youth C reported Staff 5 has\nalso left the facility on a few occasions. They have found out Staff 5 has left, either\nwhen they returned from being out or came downstairs and Staff 5 was gone. Youth\nB reported the incidents have been in the past and recently, but she could not give\nspecific dates.\nYouth B and Youth C reported reporting these concerns to a supervisor or Staff 4,\nbecause it’s easier; and Staff 4 can alert Staff 3. Youth B said Staff 4 would alert IL-\nPlus Home Manager 1, because it was reported a week ago. Youth C reported they\nhave also mentioned it at team meetings. Youth C was not sure if IL-Plus Home\nManager 1 had done anything about the matters, because she only met him once.\nStaff 4 was interviewed by me via telephone on 1/28/2021. Staff 4 reported working\nsecond shift (3:00pm-11:00pm). She said the shifts are normally a one staff person\nshift unless they are training another staff. Staff 4 stated most of the girls in the\nhouse have reported concerns of other staff members sleeping on the job. The girls\nreported they do and not feel comfortable waking the staff. Youth A, and Youth B\nnamed Staff 2 and Staff 5; but all the girls have not been shy, to complain to her.\nTheir focus on Staff 5 was more about Staff 5 not being open to interacting or talking\nwith them. Also, about Staff 5 leaving the house, or them not feeling listened to.\nStaff 4 said, the girls may have been having emotional issues and wanted to talk but\nreported the staff person would either be on their phone or sleeping. Staff 4 said\n9",
    "these concerns have been going on for a month. Once the concerns are reported to\nher, she sends a text message about it to Staff 3 and IL-Plus Home Manager 1. She\nhas also called. Staff 4 stated she has reported the matter to administration more\nthan once. The most recent reporting was two weeks ago. Staff 4 was not\nknowledgeable of camera footage capturing staff sleeping. She said, they have only\nhad cameras for about a month; and they have malfunctioned. Staff 4 was not sure if\nthere have been any consequences to staff related to the concerns. Staff 3 has\nindicated the matter is being handled.\nYouth D was interviewed by me via telephone on 1/29/2021. Youth D reported not\nbeing sure what staff do on their shifts. She said if she has a need, a staff will assist\nher on all shifts. She denied knowledge of any staff sleeping on the job or leaving\nthe house during that staff’s shift. Youth D reported, she never goes downstairs on\nthe midnight shift; and on the afternoon shift, the staff is always there. Youth D\nreported hearing the other girls talking about staff sleeping on the job, but she never\nsaw such, or reported such.\nOn 1/20/2021, and 2/8/2021, I spoke with IL-Plus Home Manager 1 about these\nallegations and inquired about possible video footage. IL-Plus Home Manager 1\ninitially did not believe there would be video footage. He reported they only put\ncameras up last month. He said, there were camera battery issues, and there is no\nvideo footage of the alleged staff sleeping. IL-Plus Home Manager 1 denied prior\nknowledge of allegations pertaining to Staff 2 or Staff 5 sleeping on the job. He said,\nit was brought to his attention that Staff 5 was leaving her shift; but Staff 3 nor\nanyone advised him of a staff sleeping on the job. Staff should not be sleeping on\nthe job. He said, he addressed the issue of staff leaving their shift. A staff reported\nleaving to get lunch. He advised all that the afternoon staff (and of course midnight\nstaff) must be present. He advised of the importance of them remaining on shift.\nThat if they have to leave the house, they must alert him. However, if there are\nresidents onsite, they can’t leave.\nOn 2/8/2021, I interviewed Staff 5 by telephone. Staff 5 was informed of the\nallegations. After requesting to call me back, Staff 5 admitted to the allegations of\nsleeping on her shift and leaving the house during her shift. She reported during\nsuch on more than one occasion. She reported, during the times she has worked\nthe 11:00pm-7:00pm shift, she has “dose off”. She reported being disciplined about\nthree weeks ago for her behavior of leaving her shift. She reported she has not\nbeen sleeping on her shift lately because she keeps busy doing various tasks.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.1208 Job description.\n(2) Each job description shall contain all of the following\ninformation:\n(4) Practice shall conform to the job description.\n10",
    "ANALYSIS: Three of four of the IL-Plus youths living in the home reported\nStaff 2 and Staff 5 have been seen sleeping on the job or they\nhad to wake the staff to take their medication. Also, that Staff 5\nhas left her shift/ left them unattended. Additionally, Staff 4\nreported the youths have reported these allegations to her; and\nshe in turn reported them to upper administration.\nStaff 2 denied the allegations, but Staff 5 admitted to them.\nThe staff did not adhere to or confirm to the requirements of\ntheir job description and requirements related to youth\nassistance or supervision during their shifts.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective plan, continuation of the facility’s current\nlicensing status is recommended.\nMarch 5, 2021\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 10, 2021\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n11"
