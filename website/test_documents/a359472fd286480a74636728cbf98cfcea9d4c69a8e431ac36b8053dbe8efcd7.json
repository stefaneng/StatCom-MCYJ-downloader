    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nRule 400.4123 Education\n• (2) Provision shall be made for an appropriate\neducation program in accordance with 1976 PA\n451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1853. Each resident of\nschool age shall be enrolled not later than 5\nschool days after admission and continuously\nthereafter.\nOne of three youth was not enrolled in school within 5 days of admission with no\nreason documented.\nRule 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; initial treatment plan\n• (1) The social service worker shall complete,\nsign, and date an initial treatment plan for each\nresident within 30 calendar days of admission.\nTwo of two ITPs were not completed within 30 days. One plan due on 11/16/23\nwas not completed as of 12/1/23, and another plan was completed 30 days late.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Rule 155 (1) and 156 (1) - Treatment Plan authors must ensure timeframes for\nITPs are no longer than 30 days and UTPs are no longer than 90 days.\nTimeframes for plans need not overlap. For example, if the end date on the\nprevious plan is 1/31/24, the next plan should start on 2/1/24.\n• Rule 123 (2) - If due to extenuating circumstances, a youth cannot be enrolled in\nschool within 5 days, the reason should be documented and placed in the\neducation section of the youth's file.\n3",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• In October 2023, I discovered the type of clientele had recently changed in Deroy\nand Myriam Halls and that a bolt lock was placed on the exit door of Myriam Hall. I\nasked the facility to immediately remove the bolt lock and requested a new Fire\nInspection. Two Fire Inspections were completed. The first received a D rating\nand the follow up inspection received an A rating qualifying Myriam as a secure\nbuilding on 12/21/23. Consultation was provided related to the change in acuity of\nthe youth in buildings under the Vista Maria Open Residential license. Myriam\nHall transitioned from non-secure to secure and a new application was received\nidentifying Myriam Hall as such.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. However, there was one confirmed case related to SIR 2023C0000510.\nThe staff involved was placed on administrative leave on 7/10/23 and officially\nterminated on 9/5/23.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 5 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nFive CAPs submitted. All goals were met on two. Three CAPs are still being\nmonitored for implementation.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were identified.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nFive CAPs were submitted for the period under review. Two were completed and\nthree are pending completion.\n4",
    "Staff and Youth Interviews\nOne staff person shared that the type of clientele accepted into Deroy and Myriam\nHalls recently changed from stepdown/transitional living to mental health. As a\nresult, I requested a revised program statement and provided other assistance and\nconsultation.\nYouth reported no concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nYouths relaxing after school. Staff were stationed in general area and hallway to\nrooms. Three residents are brand new, and all were recently directly released from\npsychiatric hospitals. Observed general living spaces and rooms which were neat\nand clean. Supply closet locked.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nDecember 28, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 3, 2024\n_____________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
