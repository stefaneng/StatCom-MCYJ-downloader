EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period. The corrective action plan was regarding the agency’s 2023\nRenewal inspection. During that inspection 7 rule violations were established, 2 of\nwhich were repeat violations from 2022. Two of the 2023 citations were repeat\nviolations this year. The number of individual cases cited this year for one of those\n6",
    "rules, R400.12324(2)(b), decreased from 3 of 6 to 1 of 6. The number of\nindividual cases cited related to the other rule/standard, FOM 801-3, increased\nslightly from 2 of 6 to 3 of 6.\nIn the agency’s 2022 Interim inspection, 14 violations were established; 2 of which\nwere repeat violations this year. As it relates to those repeat violations, the\nnumber of individuals cases cited deceased for one of the rules,\n{R400.12212(3)(a)} from 4 of 15, to 1 of 18. The number of cases cited increased\nslightly for the other rule/standard {FOM-722-D} from 2 of 8, to 3 of 6.\nIt is noteworthy, the agency’s compliance around its 2023 CAP has been positive,\ndespite the fact they had almost total staff turnover (14 new staff). The agency\nprovided sample proofs of emails, calendar reminders, and meeting agendas with\nstaff related to timeframes and review of the CAP. The agency will need to\ncontinue its efforts to work on staff retention, and to maintain rule compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a Chief Administrator’s (CA) report dated 6/4/2024. The\nadministrator’s report indicated the agency experienced a difficult time maintaining\nfoster care and supervisory staff; as well as that a large amount of time was\nneeded to train the new staff. These matters were also discussed with the\nadministration during the entrance conference along with some efforts the agency\nis trying around minimizing staff turnover. The CA indicated notwithstanding\nworker turnover its CAP has relatively worked out well during this period. That a\nnumber of the staff that had issues with rule compliance are no longer with the\nagency. Additionally, the CA indicated varying compliance ranges related to\nmany of its KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) with medical and dental\ncompletions being at 100% for its highest rating, and its lowest rating being 34%\nfor parent/worker contacts, due to parents not participating or not showing up for\nvisits.\nThe CA reported the agency will continue all efforts to maintain staff and to ensure\ngoing and increased rule compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted an annual 2024 budget and 9/30/2023 independent\nfinancial audit. A review of these documents did not show any concerns.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to my discussion with the chief administrator, licensee designee, foster\ncare program manager, licensing supervisor, human resource representative, and\na foster care supervisor at the entrance conference, I interviewed two foster care\nworkers, one adoption worker, one licensing worker. The staff interviewed\nreported feeling supported by their supervisor and the administration. Other\nthemes that came out of interviews were that the agency has a very team-oriented\nenvironment, where staff are checked on and offered lots of training. Additionally,\nwhere the agency makes sure children feel comfortable in their placements; and\n7",
    "that suitable, appropriate child placement matches are made. Areas of growth or\nimprovements indicated were for continued recognition, support and an\nunderstanding that foster care is a tough job; pay increases; more communication\naround the agency’s corrective action plan’s progress and workers’ role in that;\nmore frequent check ins by supervisors with new workers in the beginning of\nemployment; and more meetings/opportunities to engage with staff in the agency’s\nmany other offices.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency's office was conducted and no concerns were\nobserved. The facility had adequate space and equipment for its staff; and files\nwere properly stored and secured.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJuly 17, 2024\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 23, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n8"
