The purpose of this inspection was to determine\ncompliance with applicable licensing statutes and administrative rules for Court Operated\nResidential Care Facility.\nYour facility was found to be in compliance with the requirements of Act No. 218 of the\nPublic Acts of 1979, as amended, Act No. 258 of the Public Acts of 1974, as amended,\nand the applicable Administrative Rules.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility submitted one approved corrective action plans during this review period.\nThis CAP was in regard to the special investigation 2021C0212007 with an approved\nCAP on 3/30/21. The violation of this special investigation involved rule 400.10175\n(Resident confinement room) when staff did not complete the required room checks on\ntwo youth in room isolation. The facility did have surveillance footage to show the youth\nwere being supervised, the staff did not document the room checks as required in this\nrule. The approved CAP involved the facility adding room checks to the training\ncalendar and lesson plans to ensure all staff are made aware of the need for\ndocumented room checks when a youth is in their room. The facility will conduct twice\nyearly training on this issue and compliance will review room checks daily. A review of\nthese daily room checks was conducted during this inspection and the facility is\n611 W. OTTAWA  P.O. BOX 30664  LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/lara  517-335-1980",
    "following through as described in the CAP. A review of staff training logs also support\nthat the facility is following through with the CAP.\nSix restraint reports were reviewed, and it was documented that the staff followed the\nfacility policy/procedures for taking this action. Six seclusion reports were reviewed and\nagain, the facility staff followed the policy/procedures when a youth was placed in\nseclusion.\nNumerous staff were interviewed, and this included administration staff to direct care\nstaff. All staff indicated a desire to use best practice when providing treatment to the\nyouth in care. The direct care staff indicated that they believed the administration was\nopen to listening to their concerns and providing the best care for youth. They also\nreported a belief that administration was supportive of their personal growth and ability\nto provide care for the youth in care. All staff interviewed report adjusting to the changes\nmade for COVID-19 and having administration provide the appropriate items to keep\nstaff and youth safe.\nConsultation was provided when the facility shared that not all staff are following\nthrough with the changes brought about by the recent CAP. They reported room checks\nare being made and documented as stated in policy/procedure, however they are trying\nto add these room checks with details to the seclusion reports. Because this is a new\nchange, it is not occurring at an appropriate compliance rate. They will add this to the\nover-night assistance supervisor’s check list of items to review each night.\nPlease contact me with any questions. In the event that I am not available, and you need\nto speak to someone immediately, please contact Jessica VandenHeuvel, the area\nmanager at (616) 204-6992.\nSincerely,\nJuly 16, 2021\nPaul Fatato\nLicensing Consultant\nJuly 16, 2021\nJessica VandenHeuvel\nArea Manager\nEnclosures\n2"
