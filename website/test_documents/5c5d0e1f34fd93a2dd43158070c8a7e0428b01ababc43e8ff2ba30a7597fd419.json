    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 4/6/24 Supervisor bit Youth K and Staff 1 scratched him.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI contacted Complainant on 4/8/24. She said her sergeant\ndirected her to contact centralized intake, but she did not know\nwhy. She expressed no additional licensing concerns.\nMISACWIS indicates Complainant told centralized intake the mark\non Youth K’s hand did not resemble a human bite.\nI notified Youth K’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation\nassignment, and she expressed no additional licensing concerns.\nI received notification the assigned Government Worker 1 would\nreturn to work on 4/9/24.\nI notified Chief Administrator (CA) and Residential Director of\nthe allegation via text. Both were out of the state on holiday. In\ntheir absence, Clinical Director was the identified person in\ncharge.\nI arrived on-site at the facility on 4/8/24 and interviewed Youth K.\nI observed a curved ½” abrasion on the right side of his hand right\nhand and two ½” faded scars on his right forearm and took photos\nof the abrasions. Youth K said Supervisor bit him and caused the\nmark on his hand, and Staff 1 scratched him causing the marks on\nhis forearm.\nYouth K has resided at Christ Child House for six months. He\nsaid the incident occurred on 4/6/24 after he returned from AWOL.\nSupervisor and Staff 1 came into his room and told him he could\n2",
    "not leave his room. “They pushed me back in my room. Staff 1\ngot on top of me on my bed and held my shirt. He brought up his\nfist. I fought him off of me.” Youth K said Staff 1 scratched him\nwhen Staff 1 was in his room. “Supervisor grabbed me and threw\nme in the closet. I tussled with Supervisor. He bit me. I got out\nand Staff 1 blocked and pushed me back in. Supervisor asked for\nanother staff. Staff 2 was sitting in a chair in the hallway. The next\nmorning, I climbed out my bedroom window and jumped off the\nroof. The police found me an hour later and brought me back.\nThey called an ambulance for my bite and cuts. They (hospital\nmedical staff) gave me a pill.” MDHHS came to the hospital.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2. He said he observed Youth K at\n12:30am on 4/7/24 after the incident, Youth K reported no injuries\nand he saw no injuries at that time. I Asked why Youth K went to\nthe hospital on 4/7/24, he did not know the reason and said the\npolice called the ambulance and they transported him.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 on 4/11/24.\nShe has worked at the facility for 18 months and witnessed the\nincident. Staff 2 said Youth K returned from AWOL on 4/6/24 and\nwas brought back by police. The police escorted him upstairs to\nhis room and “told me, Supervisor and Staff 1 to make sure Youth\nK stays in his room. Youth K was upset that his shoes were taken\nto help prevent another AWOL. He lifted his window and tried to\nget out. Supervisor and Staff 1 went into this room and redirected\nhim. I stood at his doorway and said, ‘No. You can’t come out.’\nYouth K cried and threw stuff (a pillow). Staff 1 was on my left,\nSupervisor on my right and I was in the middle. Youth K charged\nat Supervisor and Staff 1. They told him to go back and put their\nhands out in front of them. Youth K cussed and threatened to get\nthem fired and hit them in the face. He charged his head toward\nStaff 1 to get through. Youth K grabbed Staff 1’s legs and Staff 1\ntried to get free. Youth K pulled Staff 1 to the floor. Staff 1 fell to\none side and Youth K fell to the other side. Staff 1 hopped up and\nmoved back. Supervisor grabbed Youth K’s hand, helped him up\noff the floor and told him to sit on the bed. I knew Staff 1 was hurt\nbecause he was shaking…I went downstairs to get assistance\nfrom Staff 3…Youth K had no injuries and was not bleeding.”\nStaff 2 denied that Supervisor or Staff 1 pushed or touched Youth\nK. At no point were Supervisor or Staff 1 with Youth K in his\ncloset, and Staff 1 was never on top of him on his bed. Staff 2\ndenied Supervisor or Staff 1 threatening Youth K verbally. On the\ncontrary, she said Youth K threatened to “tear up staff’s cars,\nthrow a brick into Supervisor’s truck and get his mother and\n3",
    "grandmother to jump me.” Staff 2 said Supervisor did not bite\nYouth K or throw him in a closet and Staff 1 did not hold him by\nhis shirt.\nOn 4/11/24 I interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government\nWorker 1. He has worked at the facility for 15 years. Government\nWorker 1 read the allegations aloud. Supervisor responded, “I\nnever bit him.” After police brought Youth K back from AWOL, he\nsaid they “basically told us to keep him in the building.”\nSupervisor said Youth K went into a room and wanted out. “Staff\n1 tried to keep him from closing the door. Youth K raised his\nspeaker up to throw it at the window. Staff 1 spoke nicely and\ncaring to him. Youth K tapped Staff 1’s chest lightly, saying “Let\nme go.” Youth K wanted out of the room and out of the building.\nHe lunged at Staff 1 again and wrapped his arms around Staff 1’s\nknee. Staff 1 tried to get free and fell on Youth K who was on the\nbed. Staff 1 got off quickly. We were at the door supporting Staff\n1.”\nSupervisor denied anyone was in the closet. He said Staff 1 did\nnot grab or pin Youth K’s arms behind his back. Supervisor\ndenied touching any part of Youth K’s body. He saw no injuries\non Youth K and said no injuries were reported to him. He denied\nhe or Staff 1 made any verbal threats toward Youth K. On the\nother hand, Supervisor said Youth K threatened to throw\nsomething through his car window and beat my ‘old ass’ if I\ntouched him.” The next morning Youth K jumped out a window\nand AWOLed again.\nStaff 1 could not be interviewed immediately as Residential\nDirector said he was injured after Youth K grabbed his legs and\npulled him to the floor and has been on medical leave since this\nincident with a suspected torn meniscus requiring surgery.\nResidential Director confirmed youths can open their second-floor\nbedroom windows, climb onto the roof and jump to the ground.\nThe fire inspector inspected the building and prohibited putting\nlocks on the windows as they would cause a fire hazard.\nGovernment Worker 1 interviewed Doctor via phone on 4/23/24.\nDoctor indicated the mark on Youth K’s hand looked like a\nscratch, not a human bite.\nOn 4/24/24 I interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1\nvia video conference. He has worked at the facility for four years\nand is on medical leave indefinitely due to an anterior cruciate\nligament injury that happened the day of this incident.\n4",
    "Staff 1 recalled Youth K went into his room, tried to close the door\nand acted as if he was going to climb out the window. He went\nbehind his door near the closet and tied bedsheets together,\ncussing and threatening staff. Youth K picked up speakers and\nwas about to throw them at the window. Supervisor knocked the\nspeakers out of his hand. “Youth K shoved Supervisor. I held onto\nSupervisor and backed up. Youth K tackled me, and I heard a\ncrunch in my knee. I went down and used my body weight to get\nup. We (Staff 1 and Youth K) tried to get up.” Youth K started\ncrying about his family. Supervisor and Staff 1 tried to de-escalate\nhim… I went to the hospital.”\nI interviewed Staff 3 jointly with Government Worker 1 via video\nconference. She has worked part-time at the facility for 13 years.\nStaff 3 said the police advised staff to keep Youth K in his room\nbecause they did not want to return to the facility. Youth K was\nsubsequently placed on “runaway status” meaning his shoes were\nconfiscated to discourage him from truanting. Staff 3 said she did\nnot witness anything that happened with Supervisor, Staff 1 and\nYouth K in the youth’s room. When she arrived in the residential\nhallway, she said Staff 1 was already injured and she was\nassigned to monitor Youth K in his room. Staff 3 said she did not\nsee any injuries on Youth K and he did not tell her he was bitten\nby Supervisor or mishandled by Staff 1.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Incident report by Supervisor dated 4/6/24 at 6pm indicated\nYouth K was in his room and wanted to close his door all\nthe way. He picked up his speaker and threatened to break\nhis window. Supervisor grabbed the speaker out of his\nhand with Staff 1’s assistance. Youth K continuously tried\nto exit the room pushing staff in the process and refusing\nverbal directives.\n• I reviewed the Discipline and Behavior Management Policy\nwhich indicates Christ Child House specifically prohibits\nphysical abuse and verbal abuse of residents by staff.\nVideo Review:\nThere are no cameras inside of the youths’ rooms. Footage of the\nsecond-floor hallway on 4/6/24 from 6:25pm – 6:50pm showed\nYouth K walking in and out of rooms while Staff 1 sat in the hall.\nYouth K entered a room at the end of the hall and Supervisor and\nStaff 1 followed him inside. Staff 2 appears. Staff 3 goes into the\nroom. Staff 1 exits the room limping. Supervisor exits the room.\n5",
    "Government Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis Youth K had two abrasions on his right hand. The doctor who\nexamined him stated the mark(s) on his hand looked like\nscratches and not a human bite. Two staff witnessed the series of\nevents in Youth K’s room. All staff denied that Supervisor or Staff\n1 bit, pushed or scratched the youth. It could not be determined\nwhen or how Youth K’s hand was scratched.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iii)Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or otherwise\nsuggesting physical or emotional harm to a youth.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Supervisor and Staff 1 each verbally threatened bodily harm to\nYouth K.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth K said Staff 1 told him if he ever catches Youth K in the\nstreet he will do “something” to him, which Youth K took as a\nthreat. He also said Supervisor told him he would “break every\nbone” in his body.\nSupervisor denied that he or Staff 1 made any threats toward\nYouth K. He did say Youth K threatened to throw something\nthrough his car window and beat his “old ass” if Supervisor\ntouched him.\nStaff 2 denied that Staff 1 or Supervisor verbally threatened Youth\nK. On the contrary, she said Youth K threatened to hit them in\ntheir faces and get them fired.\n6",
    "Staff 1 denied threatening harm to Youth K. However, he said\nYouth K was threatening to “kick our butts.”\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• I reviewed the Discipline and Behavior Management Policy\nwhich indicates Christ Child House specifically prohibits\nphysical abuse and verbal abuse of residents by staff.\nAnalysis Interviews did not support that any staff threatened Youth K with\nbodily harm.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Seclusion within secure and nonsecure facilities; seclusion\nTitle plan; prohibitions; reduction and elimination.\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4162\nSection (11) All seclusion will be prohibited effective November 1, 2022.\nDescription\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Supervisor and Staff 1 blocked Youth K from exiting his room to\nprevent him from AWOLing.\nInvestigation There are no video cameras inside the youth bedrooms.\nInterviews:\nYouth K said Supervisor and Staff 1 came into his room and told\nhim he could not leave his room. “I tried to leave through the\ndoor. They blocked me from leaving.”\nStaff 2 said she was aware the licensing rules prohibits staff from\npreventing a youth from exiting his room. In this instance, she\nsaid staff followed the directive from police officers instead of\nfollowing the rule explaining, “We did it for Youth K’s safety.”\nSupervisor said, “The police basically told us to keep Youth K in\nthe building.” He was aware the licensing rule prohibits staff from\npreventing a youth from exiting a room or the building but said\nstaff violated the rule to keep Youth K safe.\nStaff 1 denied that he or Supervisor blocked Youth K from exiting\nhis room.\n7",
    "Analysis Interviews indicated police escorted Youth K upstairs to his room\nand advised staff to keep him in his room or the building. Staff\nwere aware that preventing a youth from exiting his room was\nprohibited but said they did it anyway to keep Youth K safe.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nApril 30, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 9, 2024\n_______________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n8"
