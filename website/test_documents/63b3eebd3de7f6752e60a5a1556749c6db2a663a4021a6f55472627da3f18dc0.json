    "FOM 802-1 Psychotropic medication consent\nShort-Term –\nOne of four youth in the short-term program was\nadministered psychotropic medication for three weeks\nwithout a valid signed consent from the parent/guardian.\nThe consent form on file was dated 2019.\nIV. CONSULTATION/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nOn 3/4/21, the Chief Administrator for Methodist was asked not to accept new youth into\nthe short-term shelter program until the program statement and related policies were\napproved, and the terms of the license were changed to include short-term care. I\nprovided technical assistance and consultation regarding required referral information\nupon admission, emergency/off hours intake processes, length of stay, discharge and\nservice plan templates, processes and documentation for internal transfers between\nprograms and tracking document due dates for licensing compliance.\nOn 3/24/21 the facility submitted an acceptable shelter program statement, procedures,\nservice plan templates and a new application. The program was approved by DCWL\nand added to the license on 3/24/21.\nMethodist informed me they recently contracted with an outside agency for their staff to\ncome regularly to Methodist’s campus and provide additional recreational and\ntherapeutic services to the youth. The names of these staff had not been submitted to\nCentral Office so that Central Office could run their clearances. I asked Methodist’s\nHuman Resources Manager to submit the names of the contracted employees to\nCentral Office immediately so appropriate clearances could be run.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere has been considerable effort made to reduce physical restraints at the\nfacility. Restraints decreased from 329 in 2019/2020 to only 42 in 2020/2021. This\nis a reduction of 78%.\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nMethodist Children’s Home submitted two corrective action plans resulting from\nDCWL investigations.\n7",
    "The first citation involved a staff not consistently utilizing positive intervention strategies\nwith a resident. The staff received a verbal warning for violating policy, was retrained in\nde-escalation techniques and participated in bi-weekly supervision. Compliance was\nverified. Details can be found on the CCI Compliance Monitoring spreadsheet.\nThe second citation involved the agency waiting approximately 12 hours before\nconducting a nursing assessment on a youth who alleged he was sexually assaulted by\nanother youth while truant. DCWL determined the agency should have sought\nimmediate medical attention for the youth at the time the allegation was made. The\ncorrective action involved the on-call administrator receiving a verbal warning for failing\nto send the youth to the hospital immediately. Supervision was conducted with all on-\ncall administrators to discuss the incident and policies were reviewed. The Residential\nSupervisory Team met to the discuss the incident and protocol for emergency medical\ntreatment in such instances. Verification of compliance is pending.\nV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules, ISEP requirements and/or MDHHS policies. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on their\nregular license.\nMarch 24, 2021\n________________________________________\nChild Welfare Licensing Consultant Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 24, 2021\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
