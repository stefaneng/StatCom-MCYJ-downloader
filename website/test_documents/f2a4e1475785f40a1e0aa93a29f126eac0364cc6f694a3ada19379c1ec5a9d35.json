    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nand able to meet the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Allegation #1 The caregiver asked for social security cards and\nbirth certificates last year but still does not have all of them and\nneeds to enroll one of the kids in school for the fall.\nAllegation # 2 The case manager is provided with medical\nappointment information but never provides this information to the\nrespondent mother so she can attend.\nAllegation # 3 The agency has not provided a trauma\nassessment for one of the youths as requested.\nAllegation #4 The foster parent was not reimbursed for mileage.\nAllegation #5 The agency provides unsigned/incomplete\npaperwork to the foster parent, requests a signature, and never\nprovides a copy later.\nInvestigation Several concerns were reported which were investigated\nunder the staff ability to provide for the needs of youths and\nfamilies served by the agency. Interviews were conducted as\nfollows for those concerns:\nCaregiver was interviewed by phone on 6/19/2025.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via video conferencing on\n7/3/2025.\nFoster Care Worker 2 was interviewed by phone on 7/3/2025.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 was interviewed by phone on\n7/9/2025.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 was interviewed by phone on 7/9/2025\nAllegation #1 The caregiver asked for social security cards and\nbirth certificates last year but still does not have all of them and\nneeds to enroll one of the kids in school for the fall.\nINTERVIEWS\nCaregiver reported she is a fictive kin caregiver to Youth A, Youth\nB, and Youth C. She stated she has had two different workers and\ntwo different supervisors assigned to the case who she has\nreached out to about her concerns. She reported agency staff (did\nnot specify who) informed her of agency policy that caregivers are\nto be provided with a youth’s social security card and birth\ncertificate within 30 days of placement. She stated she received\n2",
    "Youth B’s social security card and birth certificate last week,\ndespite his having been in her care since July of 2024. Caregiver\nreported she knows Youth B’s family and did not believe Youth B\nhad a social security card number, but the agency staff insisted he\ndid, yet they did not provide the number until recently. She stated\nthere was an issue with establishing paternity for Youth B, but that\nwas resolved several months ago, and she still does not have an\namended birth certificate.\nProgram Manager stated there were performance concerns with\nFoster Care Worker 1 who ended up leaving while under a\ncorrective action plan, after which Foster Care Worker 2 was\nassigned. Foster Care Worker 2 was initially supervised by Foster\nCare Supervisor 1, but there were issues with the training and\nsupervision being provided to Foster Care Worker 2 as well as\nFoster Care Worker 2’s performance, so she was recently\nreassigned to Foster Care Supervisor 2, a more experienced\nsupervisor. Program Manager reported Foster Care Worker 2 has\nresigned from the agency and her last day was the day of this\ninterview. Program Manager stated she is pretty familiar with this\ncase. She stated, when Youth B came into care, he did not have a\nsocial security number, so the agency staff were working with\nMDHHS POS Monitor to apply for one. Program Manager was not\nsure of the specific timeframe, but stated it took a while to obtain\nthe social security number. Program Manager reported Caregiver\nwas provided with the social security number after it was assigned\nto Youth B. As far as the birth certificate is concerned, Program\nManager stated Caregiver is confused. Parent A was married to\nParent B at the time of Youth B’s birth; however, Parent C has\nrecently established biological paternity through DNA testing.\nCurrently, Parent B is still the legal father as Parent C has not\nestablished legal paternity, so there is no amendment to Youth B’s\nbirth certificate.\nFoster Care Worker 2 indicated today is her last day at the\nagency in part due to the lack of training, supervision, and support\nshe received which led to her feeling as if she was an ineffective\nworker. Foster Care Worker 2 stated she was not the initial\nworker assigned to the case but was assigned 12/20/2024. She\nstated Caregiver told her she didn’t have a social security number\nfor Youth B in February of 2025, which she needed to file her\ntaxes. Foster Care Worker 2 reached out to MDHHS POS Monitor\nwho assisted in applying for the number. Foster Care Worker 2\nwas informed by MDHHS POS Monitor that Youth B was assigned\na social security number on 6/11/2025 after which the number was\nprovided to Caregiver. Foster Care Worker 2 stated she did not\n3",
    "know much about Youth B’s birth certificate being provided to\nCaregiver as she already had one when Foster Care Worker 2\nwas assigned the case. Foster Care Worker 2 stated Parent C\nestablished paternity through DNA testing, but Parent B is still\nYouth B’s legal father.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 stated she supervised the case from\nDecember of 2024 until May of 2025 during which time Foster\nCare Worker 2 was assigned to the case. She stated that it was\ndiscovered during an audit there was no social security number for\nYouth B in MiSACWIS, so Foster Care Supervisor 1 reached out\nto MDHHS POS Monitor on 2/18/2025 to ask for the social\nsecurity number to be entered. A response was received on\n2/19/2025 indicating they did not have a number for Youth B, so\nthe agency staff needed to ask his parents for the number.\nCaregiver informed Foster Care Worker 2 that Youth B was never\nassigned a social security number, which Foster Care Worker 2\nreported to MDHHS POS Monitor on 2/24/2025. On 4/1/2025,\nMDHHS POS Monitor applied for Youth B’s social security\nnumber; however, on 4/15/2025 MDHHS POS Monitor reached\nout stating Foster Care Worker 2 needed to fill out the social\nsecurity application, which she did on 4/16/2025. There was no\nresponse as of 5/12/2025, so Foster Care Worker 2 reached out\nto MDDHS POS Monitor stating Caregiver could not complete her\ntaxes without the number. MDHHS POS Monitor responded on\n6/11/2025 with Youth B’s social security number which was\nprovided to Caregiver. Foster Care Supervisor 1 stated the\nagency does not have a policy about providing foster parents or\ncaregivers with a youth’s social security number or birth certificate\nadding these documents are typically not given unless they are\nrequested. She stated the agency staff provide youths’ birth\ncertificates directly to schools for their enrollment, so Caregiver\ndoes not need one for that purpose.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 stated she was assigned to supervise\nFoster Care Worker 2 on June 2, 2025, due to Foster Care\nWorker 2 not having received proper training by her previous\nsupervisor and Foster Care Supervisor 2 being more experienced.\nShe stated she was aware of Youth B never having been\nassigned a social security number at birth and there being a lot of\nhoops to jump through to get one. She stated there has been no\ncourt hearing since she has taken over supervision of the case\nand there has been no legal change to Youth B’s paternity or birth\ncertificate.\n4",
    "Documents Reviewed\n7/30/2025 Email from Chief Administrator stating the agency does\nnot have any policies regarding providing birth certificates or\nsocial security numbers to caregivers.\nThe following email chain was forwarded by Foster Care\nWorker 2:\n• 2/19/25 – Foster Care Supervisor 1 to MDHHS POS\nMonitor requesting Youth B’s social security number be\nuploaded to his case record.\n• 2/19/2025 - MDHHS POS Monitor to Foster Care\nSupervisor 2 indicating there is no social security number in\nthe record and requesting Foster Care Supervisor 1 ask\nYouth A’s parents for the number and/or card.\n• 2/24/2025 – Foster Care Supervisor 1 to MDHHS POS\nMonitor stating the parents told her Youth A never had a\nsocial security number and asking for the next steps to\nobtain this.\n• 4/15/2025 – MDHHS POS Monitor to Foster Care\nSupervisor 2 stating a request was sent to the social\nsecurity administration who confirmed a number was never\nassigned to Youth B. She requested Foster Care\nSupervisor 1 fill out an application and sent it back to\nMDHHS POS Monitor who would then forward to the social\nsecurity administration.\n• 4/16/2025 – Foster Care Worker 2 to MDHHS POS Monitor\nwith the completed application attached.\n• 4/18/2025 – MDHHS POS Monitor to Foster Care Worker 2\nconfirming receipt of the application.\n• 5/12/2025 - Foster Care Supervisor 2 to MDHHS POS\nMonitor requesting an update.\n• 5/16/2025 - MDHHS POS Monitor to Foster Care\nSupervisor 2 indicating a second request was sent to the\nsocial security administration as there has been no update.\n• 6/11/2025 - MDHHS POS Monitor to Foster Care\nSupervisor 2 with Youth B’s social security number.\nAllegation # 2 The case manager is provided with medical\nappointment information but never provides this information to the\nrespondent mother so she can attend.\n5",
    "INTERVIEWS\nCaregiver reported she tells her assigned Foster Care Worker 2\nwhenever she schedules a medical appointment for any of the\nyouths so Foster Care Worker 2 can inform the parents. She\nstated the parents don’t attend the appointments because the\nworker never tells them about the appointments. She stated she\nknows this because Parent A tells her.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via video conferencing on\n7/3/2025. She stated she does not know if the court has ordered\nthe parents to attend medical appointments or if they are\nattending.\nFoster Care Worker 2 was interviewed by phone on 7/3/2025.\nShe reported that the agency Health Liaison Officer schedules the\nyouths’ medical appointments, but Caregiver takes the youths to\nher medical provider on different dates. Foster Care Worker 2\nstated Caregiver informs Parent C, with whom she has been in a\nrelationship, of the appointments; however, she does not inform\nFoster Care Worker 2 of the appointments or where they are\ntaking place so Foster Care Worker 2 can inform Parent A. Foster\nCare Worker 2 stated there is not a court order regarding the\nparents’ attendance as medical appointments.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 was interviewed by phone on\n7/9/2025. She states she believed Parent A was made aware of\nall the youths’ medical appointments.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 was interviewed by phone on\n7/9/2025. She reported Caregiver and Parent C were in a\nrelationship at the onset of the case and might still be in a\nrelationship. She stated Caregiver will change medical and other\nappointments at the last minute and inform Parent C, but not\nFoster Care Worker 2 or Parent A.\nDocuments Reviewed\nCourt orders from hearings that were held on 12/4/2024,\n2/26/2025, and 5/21/2025, none of which included an order for the\nparents to attend medical appointments.\nFamily Team Meeting/Team Decision Making documentation\nwithin each youth’s case record.\n• 1/10/2025 documenting it was approved for Caregiver to\npick up parents to attend medical appointments.\n6",
    "Well-Child appointments documented to have occurred after\nplacement with Caregiver:\n• Youth A - None\n• Youth B – 5/13/2025 medical appointment was to be\nscheduled at Spectrum Health; however, paperwork from\nthe appointment documents Caregiver’s mother brought\nYouth B to an appointment at Corwell Health.\n• Youth C – 2/21/2025 HLO documented a well child was\nscheduled for 1/21/2025 and was rescheduled to\n2/27/2025. The 2/27/2025 appointment was unkept as it\nwas scheduled with a specific provider at Spectrum Health\nand Caregiver brought Youth C to a different provider at\nCorwell Health on 2/21/2025. Parent A’s visit was cancelled\n2/27/2025 due to her having COVID; therefore, she would\nhave been unable to attend the appointment.\nAllegation # 3 The agency has not provided a trauma\nassessment for one of the youths as requested.\nINTERVIEWS\nCaregiver reported that Youth A & Youth B need trauma\nassessments. She stated their respective therapists\nrecommended trauma assessments several months ago, yet\nthose assessments have not been scheduled. Caregiver stated\nher worker initially stated they could not be done without a letter\nfrom the therapist, which was provided to her. The worker then\nreported an issue scheduling the assessments due to the case\nbeing in Kent County and the Caregiver living in Montcalm\nCounty. Most recently, Foster Care Worker 2 has told her she was\ntrying to find a place to do the assessments.\nProgram Manager stated she did know about the trauma\nassessments needed for this case.\nFoster Care Worker 2 reported Youth B’s mental health provider\nin Montcalm County recommended a trauma assessment for\nYouth B, which Foster Care Worker 2 communicated to Clinical\nLiaison. On 5/8/2025, Clinical Liaison responded to Foster Care\nWorker 2 stating she needed to obtain the recommendation in\nwriting, which Foster Care Worker 2 did and returned to Clinical\nLiaison. Foster Care Worker 2 received a response that the form\nshe submitted was outdated, so she needed to fill out a new one.\nAfter returning that form, she received an email from Clinical\nLiaison stating she needed to submit quarterly reports from the\nassigned enhanced foster care worker. Once those were\n7",
    "submitted, Clinical Liaison responded to Enhanced Foster Care\nWorker that there was not enough information in those reports.\nFoster Care Worker 2 stated she hasn’t heard anything since.\nFoster Care Worker 2 stated Youth A had a trauma assessment 1-\n2 years ago. Foster Care Worker 2 expressed her thoughts that\nYouth A could benefit from a new trauma assessment as her\nfather is now out of jail and she has experienced a placement\ndisruption; however, Youth A’s mental health provider has not\nrecommended a new trauma assessment.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 reported the agency staff have been\ntrying to get trauma assessments for Youth B and other youths,\nbut MDHHS staff keep saying they are ineligible, which had been\nfrustrating for staff and families. She reported working with West\nMichigan Partnership for Children (WMPC) staff to secure a\ntrauma assessment for Youth B since December of 2024. She\nstated she is still copied on all the communication regarding the\ntrauma assessments despite no longer being the assigned\nsupervisor and she received an email earlier in the day from\nClinical Liaison indicating there were needed revisions to the\nrequest for Youth B’s trauma assessment.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 reported she is not aware of any\nconcerns with securing trauma assessments for these youths. It\nwas recommended she reach out to Foster Care Supervisor 1 to\nobtain the email chains regarding the trauma assessments so she\ncan follow-up as she indicated she will be assigned the case after\nFoster Care Worker 2 leaves until a new worker is assigned.\nDocuments Reviewed\n3/5/2025 Letter from Youth B’s mental health provider\nrecommending Youth B receive a trauma assessment.\nThe following email chain was forwarded by Foster Care\nWorker 2:\n• 3/21/2025 Foster Care Worker 2 to Foster Care Supervisor\n2 with a letter from Youth B’s mental health provider\nrecommending a trauma assessment attached.\n• 5/8/2025 Foster Care Worker 2 to Clinical Liaison with\ncompleted referral form for Youth B’s trauma assessment\n• 5/20/2025 Foster Care Supervisor 2 to Clinical Liaison with\nYouth B’s Initial Service Plan, Court petition and preliminary\nhearing orders, 8/2/2024 trauma screen and most recent\nservice plan\n8",

She stated Foster Care Worker 1 did not do\nanything with the forms. When Foster Care Worker 2 was\nassigned to the case in December 2024, Caregiver asked about\nthe mileage forms. Foster Care Worker 2 stated she located the\nforms on Foster Care Worker 1’s desk and would submit them.\nWhen Caregiver did not hear any updates, she again submitted all\nher forms to Foster Care Worker 2. Caregiver recently asked\nabout the reimbursement and was told by Foster Care Worker 2\nthere was a meeting scheduled to discuss her mileage.\nProgram Manager indicated she was not aware of Caregiver not\nhaving been reimbursed for her mileage. She stated she does not\nknow of any meeting scheduled to discuss mileage but guessed\nFoster Care 2 might have been referencing a meeting with her\nsupervisor to learn how to submit mileage for reimbursement.\nFoster Care Worker 2 stated the mileage reimbursement issue\nfor Caregiver was “truly frustrating.” She stated Caregiver asked\nher about mileage reimbursement after which Foster Care Worker\n2 found unprocessed mileage forms on Foster Care Worker 1’s\ndesk. Caregiver gave Foster Care Worker 2 all her mileage forms,\nincluding copies of the forms she previously submitted, in March\nof 2025 after which Foster Care Worker 2 set up multiple meetings\nwith her supervisor to learn how to submit the mileage for\nreimbursement. Foster Care Worker 2 stated the meetings kept\ngetting cancelled, so she never learned how to submit the mileage\nfor reimbursement.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 stated she has been telling Foster\nCare Worker 2 to submit Caregiver’s mileage for reimbursement\nsince it was received from Caregiver. She stated she showed\n9",
    "Foster Care Worker 2 how to submit mileage for reimbursement,\nbut she did not remember when and there was no documentation\nof this occurring. When asked if there was any training or meeting\nregarding mileage cancelled by Foster Care Supervisor 1, she\nstated she didn’t remember that happening and did not see\nanything on her calendar when searching.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 stated she does not know the rationale\nas to why the mileage was never submitted for reimbursement,\nother than the possibility of worker turnover. She stated she will\nreach out to Caregiver for copies of her mileage forms. She was\nadvised Foster Care Worker 2 has copies.\nDocuments Reviewed\nAgency Foster Care- Foster Parent Mileage Process Map\ndocumenting the process for foster care workers to request\nmileage reimbursement. No timeframes were attached to any of\nthe steps.\nAllegation # 5 The agency provides unsigned/incomplete\npaperwork to the foster parent, requests a signature, and never\nprovides a copy later.\nINTERVIEWS\nCaregiver reported when Youth A was placed in her home a few\nmonths ago she was asked to sign what she believes were\ntemporary placement documents that were partially blank. Foster\nCare Worker 2 stated she would give Caregiver a copy but still\nhas not done so.\nProgram Manager reported having spoken to Caregiver a few\ntimes, but she never mentioned anything about paperwork not\nbeing filled out correctly or provided.\nFoster Care Worker 2 stated when Youth A was placed in\nCaregiver’s home, Foster Care Supervisor 1 gave her a\nreplacement packet to give to Caregiver since it was Foster Care\nWorker 2’s first time facilitating a replacement. Foster Care\nWorker 2 gave the paperwork to Caregiver and, the following day,\nCaregiver called her to state the paperwork wasn’t filled out\ncompletely. Foster Care Worker does not know what specifically\nwas missing; however, she stated there is a Teams chat in which\nEnhanced Foster Care Worker discussed the paperwork that was\nmissing information. Foster Care Worker 2 stated she would find\nthe chat and send screenshots.\n10",
    "Foster Care Supervisor 1 was interviewed by phone on\n7/9/2025. She stated she went over the replacement checklist and\npaperwork with Foster Care Worker 2 but didn’t verify all the\npaperwork was complete prior to Foster Care Worker 2 providing\nit to Caregiver. When asked if she filled out the paperwork or if\nFoster Care Worker 2 did, Foster Care Supervisor 1 stated she\ndidn’t remember.\nDocuments Reviewed\nScreenshots of a Teams chat emailed by Foster Care Worker\n2:\n• 3/25/2025\no Enhanced Foster Care Worker asking for help\nlocating Youth A’s medical passport or Michigan\nBeneficiary ID number for Caregiver prior to Youth\nA’s medical appointment.\no Foster Care Supervisor 1 stating the medical\nconsent-to-treat form was filled out by Foster Care\nSupervisor 2 and would have been provided by\nFoster Care Worker 2 to Caregiver in person.\no Enhanced Foster Care Worker stating she found the\nform with Youth A’s number on it from a previous\nplacement, but the copy Caregiver has does not\nhave the number.

    "Allegation #1 - When agency staff became aware of Caregiver’s\nneed for a social security number, they reached out to MDHHS\nstaff. The number was not assigned to the youth by the social\nsecurity administration and provided to the agency staff for four\nmonths.\nAllegation # 2 – The two well-child appointments that were\ndocumented to have occurred were scheduled with the youths’\nmedical providers; however, Caregiver brought the youths to well-\nchild appointments at a different provider without notifying the\nagency.\nAllegation #3 – A trauma assessment was recommended by\nYouth A’s mental health provider. There is no documentation\nrelated to a request for a trauma assessment until 2 months after\nthat recommendation was made so it is unknown what was done\nduring that time; however, once documentation of a referral for a\ntrauma assessment began, it is documented the agency staff have\nbeen responding to all requests for information related to obtaining\nthe trauma assessment for Youth B, timely.\nAllegation #4 – Agency policy does not dictate a timeframe in\nwhich caregivers (in this case, unlicensed fictive kin) are to be\nreimbursed for mileage.\nAllegation #5 -While it was not clear what incomplete paperwork\nCaregiver signed and did not receive copies of when Youth A was\nplaced in her home, replacement paperwork was reviewed and\nfound to contain all required information at the time of placement.\nThere was discussion of Caregiver not being provided the youth’s\nMedicaid number on the consent to treat card; however, this was\nnot something signed by Caregiver, Additionally, the number was\nprovided to Caregiver when requested.\nCONSULTATION:\n• Consider adding review of each youth’s record for a social\nsecurity number at intake to ensure a number has been\nassigned to the youth.\n• Ensure all actions related to obtaining a trauma\nassessment for a youth are documented in case contacts.\nSupervisor 2 should follow up with Supervisor 1 to obtain\nher recent contacts regarding the trauma assessment so\nshe can continue to follow-up and secure the service.\n• Consider adding a timeframe to policies/procedures related\nto timeframes in which workers must process mileage\nreimbursement requests to ensure caregivers are\n12",
    "reimbursed in a reasonable amount of time. In this case,\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 should follow-up with Caregiver\nto ensure immediate processing of her past-due mileage.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and family time; in person\nSection contact.\nDescription • (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family\ntime for each child in foster care consistent with the child's\nservice plans, as required by R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420 to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency would not reschedule parenting time for 3 foster youth\nwhen it was needed due to surgery of one of the youths. The\nagency could not provide the policy that adheres to this practice\nwhen it was requested.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nCaregiver reported one of the youths had surgery which took\nplace during scheduled parenting time. The parents went to the\nsurgery after which Foster Care Worker 2 cancelled the parenting\ntime for that day. When Caregiver asked when the parenting time\ntook place, Foster Care Worker 2 told her the surgery would be\nconsidered parenting time. No explanation was provided as to why\nparenting time was cancelled for the other two youths who were\nnot present during the surgery.\nCaregiver stated, in the beginning of the case, a lot of parenting\ntimes were cancelled due to lice or illnesses, which Caregiver\nunderstood; however, there were multiple times the agency staff\ncancelled parenting times because they did not have anyone to\nsupervise the visit or for other unknown reasons. Caregiver stated\nthe agency staff never made up any of those parenting times. She\nstated parenting time for Parent A was recently changed from\nsupervised to unsupervised. A Team Decision Making (TDM)\nmeeting was held during which it was established Parent A’s\nSunday visits were flexible and that she needed to text both\nFoster Care Worker 2 and Caregiver by 5:00pm on Wednesdays\nto let them know she will be attending her Sunday visit and where\nthe visit is to take place. She stated the first two visits following the\nTDM went fine, and Parent A communicated as agreed upon.\nParent A did not show up for the 3rd visit and did not text Caregiver\non Wednesday for the 4th visit. Caregiver reached out to Foster\nCare Worker 2 the following Thursday and Caregiver was told\nParent A had confirmed the visit with Foster Care Worker 2 so it\n13",
    "would be taking place. Caregiver asked Foster Care Worker 2 for\na screenshot of this communication as she had not received\nanything after which Caregiver received an email from Foster\nCare Supervisor 2 stating Parent A was following what was\nestablished during the TDM. Foster Care Worker 2 was on\nvacation the following week and Caregiver did not receive a text\nfrom Parent A on Wednesday, so she did reach out to the agency\nand did not bring the youths anywhere for a visit with Parent A.\nProgram Manager stated she is aware of the visit concerns\nrelated to Youth B’s surgery. She stated Visitation Specialist\nmisunderstood her supervisor, Foster Care Supervisor 2,\nregarding the surgery and visitation. Program Manager stated\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 would have more information about that\nincident. Program Manager stated she is not aware of any visits\nbeing cancelled and not made up and does not know if Parent A is\nrequired to text Caregiver before visits.\nFoster Care Worker 2 reported having been on paid time-off\nwhen Youth B’s surgery occurred, but when she returned, she\nwas told by Visitation Specialist it is agency policy that if both\nparents are present at a youth’s medical appointment, it counts as\nparenting time, so there would be no additional visit offered.\nFoster Care Worker 2 stated this did not make sense to her\nbecause it was surgery, so they weren’t visiting with Youth B, and\nYouth A and Youth C were not there. Foster Care Worker 2 stated\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 was “stern” on not making up the visit.\nFoster Care Worker 2 stated she wasn’t aware of the agency\ncancelling visits due to not having anyone to supervise. She\nstated there was a time when she first was assigned to the case\nthat Caregiver wanted to supervise visits which she did for a while.\nIn April of 2025, a visit was cancelled because Caregiver said the\nagency was “using her.” That visit was rescheduled and\nsupervised by a different relative.\nFoster Care Worker 2 reported the current protocol for visits is as\ndescribed by Caregiver. She stated Parent A reached out to\nFoster Care Worker 2 directly requesting to change the day of one\nof her visits. When Foster Care Worker 2 told her of the change,\nCaregiver wanted Foster Care Worker 2 to give her a screenshot\nof that request. Foster Care Worker 2 stated Caregiver “flipped\nout” on her after which Foster Care Supervisor 2 told Caregiver\nher behavior was inappropriate.\n14",
    "Foster Care Supervisor 1 reported she was not aware the visit\nwas cancelled because of Youth B’s surgery. She stated it doesn’t\nmake sense to her why that visit wouldn’t have been rescheduled\nor made up. She stated she was never contacted about any\nconcerns with that visit.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 reported, at one point, there was a lot of\ncontention about who was supervising visits for this case. During a\nFamily Team Meeting (FTM) Caregiver asked to supervise visits.\nShe was told it would be fine for her to supervise, which she did\nfor a while. At one point, when Caregiver was told of a scheduled\nvisit, she became upset and stated the agency was using her, so\nthat visit was cancelled. That visit was rescheduled and occurred\nwith a different person supervising. Foster Care Supervisor 1 was\nnot aware of any other visits being cancelled.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 stated she supervises Visitation\nSpecialist who was responsible for the visits during the week of\nYouth A’s surgery. Foster Care Supervisor 2 stated Parent A\ncancelled her parenting time visit scheduled for either the week\nbefore or earlier in the week of Youth B’s surgery. Visitation\nSpecialist thought Parent A’s attendance was being considered as\na make-up visit for the prior visit Parent A had cancelled which is\nwhy it was documented to have been a visit; however, the visit\ncancelled by Parent A was not being rescheduled due to there not\nbeing a valid reason for the cancellation. Foster Care Supervisor 2\nstated Parent A had a visit the same week as Youth B’s surgery\nwith all three of her children, so she was provided with her\nparenting time, as required. Foster Care Supervisor 2 reported\nshe is not aware of any visits being cancelled due to there not\nbeing anyone available to supervise.\nDocuments Reviewed\nCatholic Charities West Michigan Foster Care Program\nMinimal Parenting Time Rules states the following:\n• CCWM staff reserve the right to cancel parenting time if\nanyone attending has any of the following symptoms:\nfevers, diarrhea, vomiting, excessive coughing, sneezing,\nrashes, etc. If any of these health conditions are present,\nparenting time may be cancelled and not resume until the\nperson is in good health.

    "Visitation Plan\n• Established 1/31/2025 – Parent A, 2 hours weekly & Parent\nC, 2 hours weekly.\nFTM/TDM\n• No documentation located requiring Parent A to include\nCaregiver in texts regarding visits.\n• 1/10/2025, 4/28/2025, and 7/28/2025 FTM paperwork all\ndocument the parents are to be provided with two visits per\nweek.\nAnalysis A violation is being established as a youth’s surgery was used as\nparenting time for one of two weekly visits despite only one of the\nthree youths being present. Social Work Contacts indicated\nadditional time would be offered at Youth B’s birthday party;\nhowever, the agency cancelled a visit the week of the birthday\nparty. Therefore, only one visit occurred during the week of the\nsurgery as well as the following week, which does not align with\nthe visitation plan.\nCONSULTATION:\n• When discussing visitation plans during FTM/TDMs, ensure\nthe visitation plan is specific. If the 2 hours required by the\nvisitation plan are to occur through two 1-hour visits,\ndocument that within the FTM/TDM documentation.\n• When standards are implemented specifying how/when\nparents are to communicate their attendance at parenting\ntime, put these standards in writing and provide to all\napplicable parties.\nConclusion Violation Established\n17",
