    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 3/24/21, youth was given time to calm down after verbally escalating. After two\nminutes, staff checked on youth who was no longer in the hallway. Staff could not\nlocate youth inside facility. The door at the end of the hallway was not secure and it\nas determined youth was able to leave the facility. Youth was unable to be located\nin the surrounding area.\nOn 3/26/2021 I received the allegations submitted by the Chief Administrator\ndocumenting the events as described in the initial notification and adding that the\ndoor was checked after the Youth A left the building and it was secure.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 3/24/2021 I received a notification from Staff that Youth A went AWOL from the\nAntonin program at approximately 3:30pm by “somehow” escaping through a long\nhallway back door. Staff were unable to locate her outside.\nOn 3/29/2021 I completed an unannounced visit to the facility at approximately\n10:30am. While at the facility, I checked the door from which the youth was able to\nAWOL and found it to be secure and locked. I attempted to open the door three\ntimes, waiting several minutes between each attempt, and it remained locked each\ntime.\nDocument Review\nOn 3/26/2021 I received and reviewed an Incident Report (IR) written by Staff 1\ndocumenting that on 3/24/2021 Youth A was escalated and asking that staff let her\ninto her room. Staff did not due to her history of self-harm but told her they would\ngive her space and left the hallway. Less than 3 minutes later, staff returned to the\nhallway and Youth A was gone. Youth A returned to the facility at approximately\n6:30pm. The following morning, it was discovered that the door at the end of the\nhallways leading to an unsecure door to the outside was malfunctioning and the lock\nwas “not latching properly.”\nOn 3/26/2021 I received and reviewed a work order showing that the door was\nrepaired on 3/25/2021.\nInterviews\nChief Administrator - On 3/26/2021 during a virtual meeting regarding a different\nissue, Chief Administrator reported that, when it was discovered that Youth A was\nmissing, the staff could not initially determine how she left because the door was\nsecure ad locked. Youth A left through the door again the next day at which time it\nwas discovered that the door was not latching properly. Facilities staff were notified\nand determined that the door was “sagging” due to the building settling, resulting in\nthe door malfunctioning. The door was immediately repaired.\nStaff 1- On 3/28/2021 I interviewed Staff 1 and Youth A in person. Staff 1 reported\nthat, on 3/24/2021, Youth A was upset and escalated. Staff 1 gave her space by\n3",
    "leaving Youth A alone in her bedroom hallway. Less than 3 minutes later, Staff 1\nreturned to the hallway and Youth A was gone. Staff 1 did not know how she could\nhave left the building, so she checked all of the bedrooms before checking the door\nat the end of the hallway which leads to an unsecured exit from the building. Staff 1\nstated that she was able to push the door open despite the red light being on,\nindicating that the door is locked. She stated that she left the building to look for\nYouth A and when she returned to the building, again tried to open the door, but it\nwas locked. She stated that she tried it multiple times and it remained secure. The\nfollowing day, Youth A left through the door again, but never left the building. The\ndoor was repaired that same day.\nYouth A – Youth A reported that she was in her bedroom hallway and heard Staff 2\nsay that Youth A wanted to AWOL and that the door at the end of the hallway was\nunlocked. Youth A then opened the door and left the building. She stated that she\ndid not know the door was malfunctioning until she heard Staff 2 say that it was. The\ndoor was locked after she returned, but she was able to push it open again the\nfollowing day. She stated that the door is fixed and secure now.\nStaff 2 - On 3/30/2021 I interviewed Staff 2 by phone. She reported that she was not\naware that the door at the end of Staff 1’s bedroom hallway wasn’t working properly\nuntil after the incident. She stated that she was in the milieu conducting a house\nmeeting at the time of the incident and didn’t know the youth went AWOL until an\nhour after the fact. She stated that, after she found out about the incident, she\nchecked the door throughout the remainder of her shift, and it was always locked.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4407 Facility and premises maintenance.\n(1) A facility and premises shall be maintained in a clean,\ncomfortable, and safe condition. The facility shall be\nlocated on land that is properly drained.\nANALYSIS: A secure door at the facility was not functioning properly\nallowing for a youth to AWOL from the building.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4",
