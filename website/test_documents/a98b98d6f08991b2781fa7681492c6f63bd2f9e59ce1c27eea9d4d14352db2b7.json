INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to\nSection requirements; staff qualifications.\nDescription (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 threatened to burn down the facility and \"tried to fight\" an\nunidentified youth.\nInvestigation I notified the Foster Care Worker, who is also the Complainant,\nthat DCWL was assigned this complaint. No additional concerns\nwere expressed.\nVista Maria Open Residential (Myriam Hall) is a non-secure\ntreatment facility. The youth attend a charter school on campus\nand have part-time jobs in the community.\nI interviewed Youth M jointly with Government Worker 1 on 3/6/23.\nYouth M admitted she did not hear Staff 1 say she would burn\ndown the building, but she heard this from another youth. She did\nnot say which youth she heard it from. On 3/2/23 Youth M said\nYouth D did not want to be wanded with the metal detector after\nschool and ran toward Staff 1. “Staff 1 put her keys down and\nwas angry.” Youth D said she and Youth A got between Youth D\nand Staff 1.\n2",
    "Youth A refused to be interviewed by investigators.\nI interviewed Youth D jointly with Government Worker 1. She\ndisplayed a tough excitable demeanor. Youth D said on 3/2/23,\n“Me and Staff 1 was going back and forth because we was getting\nwanded. I asked a question. Staff 1 acted like she was gonna run\nup on me.” Youth D clarified, “She got into my personal space.\nStaff 2 grabbed Staff 1. Staff 1 told Youth K she’d burn the place\ndown and that she has a place to go but the youth don’t. Staff 1\nand I got into it before…We told Staff 3 that Staff 1 said she’d burn\nthe place down and told Staff 3 not to tell Staff 1 what we said.\nStaff was a team together. Staff 3 told Staff 1 and it escalated.\nThe whole house got upset. I filed a grievance and Rights Officer\naddressed it.”\nI interviewed Youth K jointly with Government Worker 1. She\ncalmly stated, “Staff 1 never said she’d burn this to the ground and\nnever tried to fight a youth. There’s no problem with Staff 1.\nYouth D was aggressive toward her.”\nI interviewed Youth J jointly with Government Worker 1. She\nmade statements about the staff in general. “They walk up on us,\nget in our personal space,” threaten to enforce rules and\nrecommend a more restrictive environment. Youth J said she was\nnot present, but Youths K, A and D heard Staff 1 say she would\nburn the facility. This was not corroborated by Youths K, A or D.\nI interviewed Case Manager jointly with Government Worker 1\nwith Rights Officer present. She said on 3/2/23, “We wanded kids\nbecause keys were missing. Staff 1 was matter of fact. Youth D\nwas cussing and upset. She (Staff 1) passed the want to me.\nYouth D was threatening to ‘cut up.’ I know Staff 1 did not say that\nshe’d burn down the facility or the rest of it. Staff 1 did not walk up\non Youth D or get in her personal space. It was the reverse. Youth\nD walked toward Staff 1 in an aggressive manner.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 with Rights\nOfficer present. She said on 3/2/23 Staff 1 wanded the youth after\nschool looking for missing keys. Youth D was opposed to being\nwanded and resisted, cussed, and complained about it. Youth D\ncame toward Staff 1 threatening, “Bro, I’m gonna beat your ass.”\n“Staff 1 stood up. They were ten feet apart. Staff 1 asked Youth\nD to stop acting like a toddler. Youth D got pissed off.” Staff 2\ndenied Staff 1 threatened to burn the facility down or that the\nyouth do not have a home.\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 with Rights\nOfficer present. She has worked for Vista Maria for 12 years.\nGovernment Worker 1 read the allegations aloud. Staff 1 said\nMyriam Hall staff do not typically wand youth after school, but on\n3/2/23, a school staff’s keys were missing. “We explained to the\nyouth why we needed to wand them. Youth D was the only girl\nwith a problem saying, ‘F that.’ I asked, ‘Why are we acting like a\ntoddler?’ Youth D became enraged, yelling and walked toward\nme…I went to the office and sat for a minute before I got off (work)\nat 3:30pm.”\nStaff 1 denied threatening to burn the facility down. She said she\nhas known Youth D for five years and that Youth D is known for\nname-calling and verbally threatening staff.\nGovernment Worker 1 did not substantiate maltreatment in care.\nAnalysis Youth and staff witnesses did not corroborate the allegations.\nThere is no evidence Staff 1 does not have the ability to perform\nher job duties.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMarch 30, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 6, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
