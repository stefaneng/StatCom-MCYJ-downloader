    "II. ALLEGATION(S)\nViolation\nEstablished?\nYouth A was restrained incorrectly by Staff 1. Yes\nAdditional Findings Yes\nThe agency’s policy does not comply with the Child Protection\nLaw, 1975 PA 238.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n09/02/2021 Special Investigation Intake\n2021C0325037\n09/03/2021 Special Investigation Initiated - Telephone\nVM TO CA\n09/08/2021 Contact - Face to Face\nInterview CA and watched video\n09/27/2021 Contact - Face to Face\nInterviewed staff\n09/27/2021 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\n09/27/2021 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION: Youth A was restrained incorrectly by Staff 1.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 9/8/21, I spoke to Administrator 1 and reviewed the video. Administrator 1 reported\nin the video Staff 1 went towards Youth A instead of away from Youth A to deescalate\nthe situation. This was observed by this Consultant as well.\n3",
    "I reviewed the following throughout the course of the investigation:\n Video recording\n Incident Report\nI reviewed the video dated for 8/18/21 at 3:02:31pm.\n3:02:36: Youth A is at back area in dorm near a table and throws papers off table\n3:02:53: Youth A comes towards Staff 1 in aggressive manner and then paces\naround\n3:03:02: Youth A then walks towards Staff 1 and Staff 1 takes a step towards\nYouth A. Both Youth A and Staff 1 are face to face with little space in between them.\nStaff 2 is entering into unit and going towards Staff 1 and Youth A\n3:03:04: Staff 1 grabs Youth A’s wrists, Staff 2 grabs Youth A’s left arm\n3:03:16: Staff 1 grabs Youth A’s right arm and right shoulder and then Staff 1\nwraps his left arm around Youth A’s neck in a “headlock” position\n3:03:07: Both staff and Youth A fall to the ground\n3:03:12 Staff 1 still ahs Youth A in a “headlock” position\n3:03:15 Supervisor 1 comes into unit. Youth A is in prone position. Staff 1 is\nholding Youth A’s right arm down; Staff 2 is holding Youth A’s legs down, and\nSupervisor 1 is near the upper body holding unknown area\n3:04:20: Supervisor 1 relieves Staff 1 and Supervisor 1 and Staff 2 are now\nholding Youth A in prone position. Youth A is moving his head back and forth.\nI reviewed the CPI (Crisis Prevention Manual). Prone restraints and headlocks are not\napart of CPI training.\nI interviewed Staff 1. Staff 1 reported Youth A was cussing and not listening. Staff 1\nreported he set limits with Youth A and told him to go to the back to the unit to calm\ndown. Staff 1 reported there were four or five other youth on the unit. Staff 1 reported he\ncontinued to tell Youth A to stop swearing and to refocus. Youth A then threw items off\nthe table. Staff 1 reported he called a “Code 2” which meant he needed assistance.\nStaff 1 reported Staff 2 came into the unit and removed the other youth. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A began to walk back to the front area, making threats and “messing” with the\ncubicles with items in them. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 came into the unit and Youth A\nwalked up on him (Staff 1). Staff 1 reported he did not move forward towards Youth A.\nStaff 1 reported that he attempted to complete a two-man control position, grabbed\nYouth A’s arm and then Youth A was able to get his arm loose, causing them to fall onto\nthe ground together. Staff 1 reported, while on the ground, Staff 1 and Staff 2 were able\nto gain control of Youth A and then Supervisor 1 came into the unit and relieved him.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was in a prone position. Staff 1 reported Youth A never\nvocalized being hurt or in any duress. Staff 1 reported he does not remember placing\nYouth A in a “headlock” position, but did report that a “headlock” would not be a CPI\ntechnique.\nI interviewed Staff 2. Staff 2 reported Youth A became agitated because he did not get\nhis level. Staff 2 reported Youth A was using profanity and Staff 1 told him to stop. Staff\n2 reported a “code 2” was called so he entered into the unit and removed the other\n4",
    "youth in the room. Staff 2 reported he saw papers on the floor by the table. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 had a calm demeanor. Staff 2 reported Youth A approached Staff 1 with\nclosed fist and threatened him. Staff 2 reported he attempted to talk to Youth A but he\nwould not listen. Youth A then bumped his chest into Staff 1 and then Staff 1 reported\nhe grabbed Youth A’s left wrist. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 grabbed his right wrist and they\nattempted a two-man team control. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 lost his footing and they all\nfell to the ground. Staff 2 reported he did not see what else might have happened with\nStaff 1 and Youth A. Staff 2 reported Youth A was in prone position and that CPI does\nnot teach to perform prone restraints. Staff 2 reported he was unsure what to do if they\ndid get a youth into the prone position like they did. Staff 2 reported they kept him in\nprone position. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was attempting to help Youth A the whole time.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1. Supervisor 1 reported she had come into the unit to help.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were already on the ground with Youth A in a prone position.\nSupervisor 1 could tell that Staff 1’s presence was escalating Youth A so she removed\nhim from the unit. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A was able to move his head the whole\ntime and was talking to her. Supervisor 1 reported he was not in duress. Supervisor 1\nreported if they do have someone in prone restraint, they are to turn the youth into the\nright position. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A never reported to her that Staff 1 hurt him.\nI reviewed the Incident report dated 8/18/21. Youth was seen by the nurse on 8/18/21.\nNo injuries were noted.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand\nprocedures regarding restraint. These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their families,\nand referring agencies.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: Video observation of the incident show Staff 1 stepping towards\nYouth A, but not in a manner to start a two-man team control.\nThis move placed Youth A and Staff 1 face to face, chest to\nchest. Staff 1 placed Youth A in a “headlock” position at one\npoint and Youth A was placed in a prone restraint. All staff\nreport they placed Youth A in a prone restraint. CPI manual\ndoes not train to enter in youth’s personal space (unless\nrestraining) or to use a “headlock” position or prone position to\nsecure a youth in escalation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS: The Child Protection Law policy does not\ndesignate a time to report other than immediately.\nINVESTIGATION:\nAdministrator 1 reported this restraint happened on 8/18/21, but they didn’t call it into\ncentralized intake until 9/2/21 due to them unsure of whether they should call it in. After\ndiscussing with Administrator 2, they decided this should be called into centralized\nintake. Administrator 1 reported because there were not marks and bruises they were\nunsure if it fit the threshold for suspected abuse and neglect.\nAdministrator 2 reported their policy stated they have to call suspected abuse and\nneglect “immediately” and felt like they had done so when they discussed the event.\nI reviewed the agencies’ current Compliance with Child Protection Law policy.\nThe policy was updated on February 8, 2016. The policy does not denote a\nspecific time frame the agency is to call centralized intake after having knowledge\nof an incident where suspected abuse and neglect may have occurred.\nI reviewed the Child Protection Law, Act 238 of PA 1975.\n(1) An individual is required to report under this act as follows: (a) A physician,\ndentist, physician's assistant, registered dental hygienist, medical examiner, nurse,\nperson licensed to provide emergency medical care, audiologist, psychologist, marriage\nand family therapist, licensed professional counselor, social worker, licensed master's\nsocial worker, licensed bachelor's social worker, registered social service technician,\nsocial service technician, a person employed in a professional capacity in any office of\nthe friend of the court, school administrator, school counselor or teacher, law\nenforcement officer, member of the clergy, or regulated child care provider who has\nreasonable cause to suspect child abuse or child neglect shall make an immediate\nreport to centralized intake by telephone, or, if available, through the online reporting\nsystem…\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4131 Compliance with child protection law; development of plan\nrequired.\nThe licensee shall develop and implement a written plan to\nassure\ncompliance with the child protection law, 1975 PA 238, MCL\n722.621 to 722.638\nANALYSIS: The word “immediately” is not defined in the Child Protection\nLaw or in the agency’s policy. Although not defined in the law\nand could be subjective in defining a specific time frame, the\nword “immediately” denotes something happening without delay\nor at once, or without lapse of time. The incident occurred on\n8/18/21 and the agency contacted centralize intake on 9/2/21.\nThis lapse in time, is beyond “immediately”. The agency will\nneed to specify in their policy a time frame that will define\n“immediately” so that there is no confusion in when an agency\nmust report suspected abuse and neglect.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nA. It is recommended that the agency’s license remain unchanged upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan.\n10/15/21\n________________________________________\nVenus M.
