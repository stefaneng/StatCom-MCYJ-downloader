The youth would swing their arms at the staff member\nand the staff member slapped the youth's arms away rather than\nblocking the arms. The youth has a red mark on the outer middle\nleft forearm, but it is no longer red.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 10/21/24.\nComplainant reported the incident occurred during dinner on\n10/18/24. Complainant reported Youth A was at the table eating\nbut kept getting up from his seat. Complainant reported each of\nthe three times Youth A got up from his seat, he approached Staff\n1 and began swinging his arms and trying to hit Staff 1.\nComplainant reported each of the three separate times this\noccurred, Staff 1 slapped Youth A’s middle-outer forearm instead\nof blocking his attacks like staff are taught to do. After the second\noccurrence, Complainant reported she intervened and told Staff 1\nhe could not slap Youth A but could block him using the skills they\nlearned. Complainant reported Staff 1 did not respond to the\nredirect or ask for further direction as to how to handle the\nsituation. Complainant reported after Staff 1 hit Youth A the third\ntime, Youth A eloped from the dining room and entered the hearth\nroom. Complainant reported Staff 1 followed Youth A to the hearth\nroom and Complainant stayed with the other youth in the dining\nroom. Complainant reported after the incident, she met with Staff\n2 (lead staff) and told her what happened. Complainant reported\nStaff 2 contacted Supervisor 1 for direction as to what to do, while\nComplainant filled out an incident report. Complainant reported\nSupervisor 1 came in to talk to Staff 1, and then Staff 1 left with\nhis belongings. Complainant reported after the incident, Youth A\nhad a red mark on his forearm, but it was gone approximately 30-\n40 minutes afterwards.\nYouth A is non-verbal and could not be interviewed. He was\nobserved on 10/24/24 at the facility and no concerns were noted.\n2",
    "Supervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/24/24. Supervisor 1 reported on 10/18/24 she received a call\nfrom Staff 2 asking what needed to be done regarding an incident\nof inappropriate safety care by Staff 1. Supervisor 1 reported she\ncalled Supervisor 2 and Chief Administrator to determine what\nother steps she needed to take. The immediate safety plan they\nimplemented was Staff 1 could no longer supervise Youth A.\nSupervisor 1 reported she went to the facility to address the\nsituation further, and interviewed Complainant and Cook to\ndetermine what happened. Supervisor 1 reported she saw Youth\nA and he no longer had red marks on his forearm. Supervisor 1\nthen met with Staff 1 and informed him he was suspended for the\nincident pending investigation. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 was\nupset and stated he didn’t know why this was happening because\nhe didn’t understand what he did wrong.\nCook was interviewed face to face at the facility on 10/24/24.\nCook reported during dinner on 10/18/24, Youth A was escalated,\nand Staff 1 seemed frustrated by having to continuously tell Youth\nA to sit down. Cook reported she did not see Staff 1 slap Youth A\nbecause she was in the kitchen. Cook reported Staff 1 frequently\ntalks to Youth A like a dog. Cook reported Staff 1 is very direct,\nand shows no emotion, no kindness, no empathy or respect to\nyouth at the facility.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 11/8/24. Staff 1 reported\non 6/18/24, he and Complainant were assigned to supervise youth\nwhile they were eating dinner. Staff 1 reported he was specifically\nresponsible for supervising Youth A. Staff 1 reported Youth A is\nprone to self-exposure of his private parts, so part of Youth A’s\nbehavior plan is to be prompted every 10-15 seconds to cover\nhimself if he is exposing himself. Staff 1 reported Youth A was\neating dinner and was constantly exposing himself. Staff 1\nreported he kept prompting Youth A to cover himself, “put it away”,\netc. like he is supposed to, but Youth A would not stop. Staff 1\nreported he was very frustrated. Staff 1 reported on three different\noccasions, Youth A got up and aggressed at Staff 1 by hitting,\npushing, and/or choking him. Staff 1 reported he used the Safety\nCare protocol to block the attacks. Staff 1 reported he continued to\nuse that method and continued to block Youth A’s aggression by\npushing Youth A’s hands and arms away from him, and then\nretreating. Staff 1 reported he blocked Youth A’s assaults by\npushing his arms away, but never slapped him. Staff 1 reported\nafter the second time he blocked Youth A’s assaults, Complainant\ncame over to Staff 1 and told him they’re not supposed to slap the\nyouth. Staff 1 reported the sounds of clapping or slapping heard\n3",
    "by others were because Youth A was slapping Staff 1, not the\nother way around. Staff 1 reported he did not respond to\nComplainant because he was concerned Youth A was going to\nattack him again. Staff 1 reported he conducted himself as he was\ntrained. Staff 1 reported after the third time Youth A assaulted him,\nYouth A sat back down to eat and continued to expose himself.\nStaff 1 reported he continued to prompt Youth A not to expose\nhimself, and eventually Youth A got up and left the dining room.\nStaff 1 reported his level of vigilance at the facility has heightened\ndue to the level of aggression he’s received from other youth over\nthe course of him working there (i.e. bites, scratches, a\nconcussion).\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Agency response strategy dated 10/19/24 from Chief\nAdministrator notes Staff 1 is suspended pending the\ninvestigation.\n• Incident Report dated 10/18/24 is consistent with\nComplainant’s interview.\n• Restraint and Seclusion Policy states staff may only utilize\nprocedures in which they are trained and certified.\n• Safety Care Protective Shuffle notes if a person engages in\ndangerous behavior towards you, this provides a way to\nsafely move away. The upper position should be both\nhands up in front of your face, palms out, fingers and\nthumbs together, forearms approximately vertical. Hold\nthem up to protect yourself without actively blocking or\nstriking.\n• Discipline and Behavior Management policy states staff are\nnot allowed to hit, strike, throw, kick, pull, or push a youth\non any part of their body.\n• Staff 1 has one disciplinary record in his employee file from\n8/16/24 stating he did not use safety care appropriately, as\nhe utilized an improper grab with a youth. Staff 1 was\ntrained in Safety Care on 7/18/24 and completed a re-\ntraining on 8/17/24.\nAnalysis The facility is found in violation as per interviews conducted and\ndocumentation reviewed, Staff 1 had inappropriate contact with\nYouth A as Complainant reported Staff 1 slapped Youth A multiple\ntimes, and Staff 1 admitted to pushing Youth A’s arms away from\n4",
    "him. Neither of these are approved techniques trained by the\nfacility.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nNovember 20, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 21, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
