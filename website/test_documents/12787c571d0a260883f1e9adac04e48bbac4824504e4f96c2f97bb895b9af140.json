The youth wear their personal clothing the day they enter the\nprogram, they are then given \"program clothing\" to wear during the week and the\nyouth then wear their personal clothing home on the weekend. The youth come\nback to the program on Monday's and typically have a different outfit on and turn\nthat outfit in until they go home for the weekend again on Friday. The youth go on\nhome passes each weekend and so the facility only hold the youth clothing\nMonday through Friday. Pineview administration was given assistance on\ndeveloping a log or document to indicate what the youth are wearing each time\nthey leave or reenter the facility.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency did not require consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\n3",
    "The agency has submitted 4 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had five special investigations during this period under review with four\nresulting in corrective action plans.

Pineview completed\na corrective action plan and on August 15, 2022, had a final report that reported full\ncompliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator noted 2022 being an \"extremely difficult year for the\norganization\" noting concerns with rules changes, interpretations of the rules,\ncontract requirements, DHHS lack of response to 30-day notices, and pressure\nfrom DHHS to accept youth in the program that did not meet the program treatment\nrequirements. The Chief Administrator noted trends for 2022 that included residents\nlearning they would not be restrained for certain behaviors which caused a \"culture\nof chaos with very few boundaries and significant fearfulness felt by several of our\nresidents\". The Chief Administrator identified several special investigations that\noccurred shortly after the new rules were implemented which led to rule violations\nand corrective action plans. The Chief Administrator noted all corrective actions\nhave been completed and implemented successfully at this time. The Chief\nAdministrator noted another area of concern was with dental exams and finding a\n4",
    "provider that could meet the youth's dental needs in a timely manner. The Chief\nAdministrator reported that the facility made some changes organizationally by\ndiscontinuing the abuse/neglect contract and opening a new program that is short\nterm with court ordered youth. The Chief Administrator reported the new program is\ngoing very well so far this year.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe staff report they feel supported by administration. They all have reported\nenjoying the new program that has been opened this year. The staff voiced\nconcerns about feeling they cannot always keep youth safe due to not being able to\nstop them from running away.\nThe youth all reported feeling safe and well cared for. The youth reported being\nable to go off campus and do activities. The youth did not report any concerns\nabout the program or treatment from staff.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility was completed and there were no concerns noted.\nThe facility is in good condition with no repairs needed. The menu is posted in both\nhouses and the food is prepped in the main kitchen and brought to the houses at\neach mealtime. The bedrooms are clean and appropriately furnished. The\nbathrooms are clean, the youth use the showers in the gymnasium which are clean\nand appropriate.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_____________________________________June 12, 2023\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 12, 2023__________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
