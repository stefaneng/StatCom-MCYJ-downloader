    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112 Staff qualifications.\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform the duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Team Leader is inappropriate with Youth L. He gets into her\npersonal space, visited her at the hospital outside of work hours\nand may be \"grooming\" her.\nInvestigation These allegations were transferred from MDHHS to DCWL on\n6/2/23. On 6/2/23, I attempted to contact Complainant who was\nidentified as Vista Maria staff. The phone number provided was\nnot in service and Quality Manager informed me there was no\nstaff person with that name working at Vista Maria.\nI notified Foster Care Worker of this investigation assignment.\nShe expressed no concerns about the facility.\nI notified Quality Manager of the allegations. She told me that\nYouth L was in Garden City Hospital’s Emergency Room awaiting\na psychiatric evaluation and Vista Maria placed Team Leader on\nadministrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI arrived at Garden City Hospital at 1:00pm on 6/2/23. Staff 1 was\nsitting with her in her hospital room. I excused Staff 1 and\ninterviewed Youth L privately. She said she was placed at Vista\nMaria a month ago. I asked Youth L if Team Leader behaves\ninappropriately with her. Youth L appeared puzzled and asked,\n“Who is Team Leader?”\nYouth L denied Team Leader or any other male staff at Vista\nMaria visited her at the hospital during their off-hours or were ever\ninappropriate with her.\nI phoned Quality Manager sharing that Youth L does know who\nTeam Leader is. Later Quality Manager informed me Team\nLeader is known to the youths by his nickname and not by the\nname indicated in the complaint.\nOn 6/6/23, I re-interviewed Youth L at the facility with Quality\nManager present. I identified Team Leader by his nickname and\nYouth L acknowledged knowing him. She still denied he was\n2",
    "ever inappropriate with her. Youth L confirmed that Team Leader\ndid show up at the hospital for five minutes to “check” on her. She\nsaid he also rode with in the ambulance with her when she was\ntransported from Vista Maria to the hospital. Youth L said Team\nLeader gets along well with her and all the youths and she has no\nissues with him.\nOn 6/7/23, I interviewed Team Leader with Quality Manager\npresent. He has three years of prior experience as a direct care\nworker at another child caring institution, has worked at Vista\nMaria for 16 months and was promoted to a Team Leader six\nmonths ago. Team Leader said he did not know Youth L prior to\nher admission to Vista Maria. He said he treats all youths the\nsame and has never been accused of inappropriate behavior.\nIn contrast to Youth L’s statement, Team Leader said he did sit\nwith her in her room at Garden City Hospital for two shifts on\n5/30/23 and 5/31/23 during work hours. However, on 6/1/23 he\nsaid he worked dayshift at Vista Maria, then stopped at Garden\nCity Hospital afterward to visit Youth L and three or four other\nyouths who were also in the emergency department there. Team\nLeader said he did not have his employer’s permission to visit the\nyouths outside of his normal work hours.\nTeam Leader does not have any disciplinary write-ups in his\nemployee file.\nAnalysis The evidence does not support that Team Leader acted\ninappropriately or is unable to perform the duties of his assigned\nposition.\nYouth L and Team Leader denied Team Leader is inappropriate,\ngets into Youth L's personal space or is sexually \"grooming\" her.\nOn his off-hours, Team Leader did visit Youth L and other youths\nwho were hospitalized. This is addressed in Rule 400.4109\nbelow.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "Rule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Team Leader wears jogging pants which violates Vista Maria's\nstaff dress code.\nInvestigation Team Leader admitted he sometimes wears jogging pants to\nwork. I reviewed Vista Maria’s staff dress code policy. The policy\ndoes not prohibit direct care staff or supervisors from wearing\njogging pants.\nRelative to Team Leader visiting Youth L at the hospital during his\noff-hours, I reviewed the agency’s staff and client interaction\npolicy. The policy indicates staff are not to socialize with current\nor former clients except during Vista Maria-sponsored activities.\nTeam Leader admitted he went to Garden City Hospital after work\nto visit Youth L and three or four other youths who were\nhospitalized there. Vista Maria was not aware he visited the\nyouths, and he did not have his employer’s preapproval to visit\nthem outside of his normal work hours.\nAnalysis Team Leader did not follow the agency’s staff and client\ninteraction policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is submitted, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nJune 9, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 12, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
