Youth was then able to get into another male\npeer's room. The male youth ran into the room and closed the\ndoor. Both male/female youths were in the closed room for about\n20 seconds.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on\n04/25/2023.\nI contacted the complainant on 04/25/2023, no additional\ninformation was provided.\nI interviewed Director at the facility on 04/26/2023. Director\nconfirmed there was an incident on 04/16/2023 involving Youth A\nplaced on Pod B, gaining access to the male Pod A. She said an\ninternal investigation was completed and found that Staff 1 failed\nto properly secure the door to the male pod, went into the closet\nthat is in between the two pods to grab something for Youth A, lost\nline of sight of Youth A, and that’s when Youth A entered the male\npod. Staff on the male pod immediately called security and Youth\nA was escorted back to her Pod. Staff 1 was terminated. Youth\nhad broken the cameras on Pod B so there was no video from that\npod, but there was video footage on Pod A. Youth A was moved\nto Pod C that does not have connecting doors to the male pod.\nYouth A is very manipulative and admitted that she manipulated\nthe staff to gain access to the male pod.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 04/26/2023. Youth A is 14\nyears old and has been at the facility for 6 months. Youth A\nadmitted she manipulated the staff, to get on the boy’s pod. She\ninitially didn’t want to answer any questions related to the incident\nand said she should be the one in trouble not the staff. She said\nStaff 2 was supervising her on Pod B, she told Staff 2 to call Staff\n1 who was on Pod A, Staff 2 went to the control room, Staff 1\n2",
    "opened her pod door, she told Staff 1 to get her a sweater from\nthe closet, then ran past him and opened the door to the male\npod. Youth A said she will continue to try to manipulate the staff,\nbecause she does not like being locked up.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 04/26/2023. Youth B is 16\nyears old and has been at the facility for 8 months. Youth B is\nplaced on Pod A. Youth B recalled the incident involving Youth A.\nHe said Youth A entered the boys’ pod after Staff 1 opened the\npod door. He said Youth A ran to his room and closed the door.\nHe ran after her and staff immediately came and escorted her out\nof his room. Youth B said there is always a staff member\nsupervising the residents on his pod. He did not express any\nconcerns regarding the staff.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 on 04/26/2023. Supervisor 1 said he\nresponded to the incident involving Youth A gaining access to the\nmale pod. He said Youth A was on Pod B and she was able to\ngain access to Pod A (male pod) through a secured door that\nconnects to a short hallway with a closet between the two pods.\nStaff 3 immediately called for assistance and Supervisor 1\nresponded with security to Pod A. He said Youth A was escorted\nback to Pod B. Supervisor 1 said he has worked at the facility 6\nyears and this has never happened. He said Staff 1 made a\nhorrible mistake by not ensuring the door to Pod A was locked\nbefore opening the door to Pod B.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 05/17/2023. Staff 1 is a\nYouth Worker and has been working at the facility for 5 months.\nHe recalled the incident involving Youth A. Staff 2 was supervising\nYouth A on Pod B. He said Youth A asked him to call Staff 1. Staff\n2 went to the control room and that’s when he heard the call for\nsecurity about Youth A going onto the boys Pod. He said Youth A\nwas agitated, refused to go to her room, so he could not recall\nwhy or who opened the door leading to the closet hallway.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo of Pod A, from 04/16/2023 at 8:00 pm was reviwed. Staff 1\nopens the door leading to the hallway with the closet and Pod B. A\nfew seconds later Youth A enters Pod A and goes to one of the\nbedrooms and closes the door. Staff 3 calls for assistance.
