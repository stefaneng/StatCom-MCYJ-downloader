    "ALLEGATION:\nLicensing agency should have closed a license on a foster home due to the\nfamily’s permanency residence changing to Florida in March 2022. The\nlicense was not closed until September 2022 even though the agency was\naware the family had moved.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed the Program Director and Licensing/Adoption Supervisors on\n9/12/2022, to gather background information regarding the allegation. The program\ndirector and supervisors reported that the agency became aware that the\nfoster/adoptive family on 2/9/2022 was in need to move to Florida due to the\nfoster/adoptive father’s job. The adoption supervisor said she and her coworkers\nmet with the family to discuss their need to move and received clarifying information.\nShe said the family had already communicated with the children’s Guardian ad litem\n(GAL) who was in support of this move.\nThe Adoption Supervisor said she communicated with the permanency coordinator\nat Oakland Court to make her aware of the situation/move. She said this person was\nin support of communicating with Michigan Children’s Institute (MCI) to seek travel\npermission and to complete the Interstate Compact on Placement for Children\n(ICPC). The Adoption Supervisor said on the same day she contacted the DHHS\nmonitor prior to sending an email to MCI to make her aware of the foster/adoptive\nfamily potential move.\nThe Adoption Supervisor said she emailed the MCI superintendent, another MCI\nworker, DHHS Monitor, Oakland County Court Permanency Coordinator, and the\nGAL on 02/15/2022 discussing the potential move of the foster/adoptive family move.\nShe said the MCI Superintendent responded and added another MCI worker on the\nemail.\nThe Program Director reported that her agency completed a relocation report for the\nfoster/adoptive family in Michigan in Davison where the family were renting on\n01/27/2022. She said her agency was also aware during this time that the family\nwas looking to relocate to Florida but was keeping their home in Davison for visits for\nthe children they were going to adopt. She said no solid plans of closing their\nlicense in Michigan had been made by the family. The Program Director said her\nagency completed the family annual reevaluation on 05/09/2022 at the Davison\nhome.\nI scheduled a TEAM meeting on 09/22/2022, with my Area Manager, the Program\nManager and Adoption Supervisor of the agency to discuss the allegation and to\nidentify when the foster/adoptive family informed the agency that they were\nrelocating to Florida and the interaction prior to the decision being made. The\nagency provided a timeline, (names were removed) and it is as follows:\n3",
    "• 02/15/2022- the agency representatives completed a meeting with the\nfoster/adoptive family to discuss their need to move, receive clarifying\ninformation.

Agency foster care worker was\npresent and did her visit for their MI foster home license renewal. Foster Mother\nhad previously told the agency adoption supervisor and foster care worker that\nshe wanted to keep the MI foster home license open.\n• On 5/25/2022 OFS & MDHHS received an email from MI ICPC informing the\nagency that the foster parent’s FL home study was approved. That same day the\n4",
    "agency had a phone conference with the foster parent to discuss the home study\nand the steps needed to complete the adoption process. The foster mother\ninformed the OFS adoption supervisor again verbally that she still wanted to\nkeep her MI license open.\n• On 6/1/2022 the OFS worker received a text (which was verified by this\nConsultant) where the foster mother told the adoption supervisor, she and the\nfoster father had 60 days to switch their driver's licenses to FL; the adoption\nsupervisor called the foster mother in response to all of her questions because\nher requested information was too much to text.\n• On 6/8/2022, OFS FC/AD supervisor and OFS Licensing staff notified the foster\nmother that the FL home study was approved. The OFS staff discuss the closure\nof the family Michigan license, but the foster mother didn't want to close the\nlicense yet. (A text was provided with this information where this Consultant\nreviewed the document.)\n• On 06/13/2022 the ICPC adoption packet was submitted to the DHHS monitor.\n• On 06/15/2022 a Family Team Meeting (FTM) was held with the FP's, OFS\nFC/AD worker, OFS supervisor and MDHHS.

(This\ninformation was verified by this Consultant).\n• On 09/02/2022 MDHHS Wayne inquired to verify if OFS wanted the case close.\n• The foster home of the foster parent was officially closed on 09/07/2022.\nI observed several documents that included emails back and forth between the foster\nfamily and OFS staff, MCI email of state travel, Bridges providers change request,\nrequest from the foster parents requesting their license be close dated 8/31/2022,\nreview of the foster family reevaluation report and License from the State of Florida\nfor the foster parent. Florida also had to complete a license home study for the family\nbefore prominent resident could take place.\nThere was no documentation to support that the foster family did not have a\nprominent resident in Michigan. The family was given permission to travel back and\nforth between Florida and Michigan per MCI travel request per the foster father job.\nHowever, prominent residence remains in Michigan. All parties associated with this\ncase was aware of the circumstances surrounding the family movement and the\nprocess it took for the relocation to Florida and the closure of the Michigan license.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12403 Policy and procedures.\n(2) The policies and procedures shall cover at least all of\nthe following areas:\n(f) Unusual incidents.\nANALYSIS:\nBased on interviews from the agency, the timeline,\ndocumentation of emails, the agency acted appropriately with\nthe closure of the foster home license. The family had two\nlicense open at the same time, one in Michigan and one in\nFlorida. The agency was aware that the foster home study was\ncompleted. However, Oakland Family Services was not aware\nthat a license was issued in Florida until the family requested\nclosure of their Michigan License on 08/31/2022 and the license\nwas close on 09/07/2022 when the agency became aware that\nthe family had an open license in Florida. The agency\ncontinued to wait on the ICPC for the adoption of the children.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV.
