EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. The one Special Evaluation Report addressing a corporal punishment was\nreviewed. The report was completed timely and thoroughly.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. In 2023,\nthe agency submitted a CAP to address 12 violation. This year's inspection will\nrequire the agency to submit a CAP to address 11 violation. Of those 11\nviolations, 7 are repeated violations previously addressed in the 2023 CAP. There\nhas been an increase in number of files effected in 1 of those violations, a\ndecrease in number of files effected in 4 of those violations, and the number of\nindividual incidents remained the same in the 2 remaining violations. Additionally,\n7 of the violations cited during this inspection were previously addressed in the\n2022 CAP. Three violations established during this inspection have not been\nestablished during the previous two inspections. There has been an improvement\nin overall number of citations and individual incidents of non-compliance over the\npast 3 years. The agency staff continue to need improvement when it comes to\nobtaining and uploading signatures timely on required documentation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment indicated there has been an increase in\nstaffing over the past year which has resulted in caseworkers being able to stay\nwithin caseload compliance. New staff members have resulted in periods of\nlearning during which non-compliances have occurred. Additionally, there was\nrecognition that some of the compliance monitoring methods put into place after\n9",
    "the last inspection were not effective. The agency staff are currently working to\nimplement new methods of compliance monitoring.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed indicated that the increase in staffing and reduction\nin caseload sizes has improved their ability to perform the job requirements as well\nas increasing their motivation and overall morale. They all indicated that their\ndirect supervisors are accessible, supportive, and helpful in completing required\ntasks. Additionally, they all stated that upper management has involved the staff in\ndiscussions regarding improving compliance resulting in the staff members'\nthoughts and ideas being incorporated into compliance monitoring.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has the space and equipment needed for staff members to complete\nrequired job responsibilities. Foster care, adoption, independent living, and\ncertification files are securely stored in a locked file storage room that requires key\ncard entry. Physical CHRI is stored in a locked cabinet in the Director's office and\nthe key is held by the licensing supervisor.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified 1 safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: The DCWL Analyst was unable to assess the safety of the home due\nto the family not responding to multiple contact attempts.\nResolution: A DHHS staff member visited the home on 11/16/23. Safety was\nassessed and documented by that worker.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n10",
