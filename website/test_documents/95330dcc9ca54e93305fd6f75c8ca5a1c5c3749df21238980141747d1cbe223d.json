DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThe child placing agency program will be housed inside the administrative office\nbuilding of Judson Center in Royal Oak, Michigan. The foster care and certification\noffices will be located in a single concentrated area in the building. A visit room for\nfamily visits is located near the staff offices. A conference room, meeting spaces, and\nlocked cabinets are also located near the staff offices. The building is a one-story\nbuilding, with ample parking, and is well-maintained. There is a sprinkler system in the\nevent of fire. On the grounds of the administrative offices are three additional separate\nbuildings, where other Judson Center services are provided. One of these buildings is\ncurrently being prepared to house the foster care and certification programs. Once the\npreparations are complete, the space will be inspected by the consultant, and an\naddendum to this report will be completed. The space in the administrative building is\nsufficient for the foster care and certification programs to conduct business and to\nprovide services to children and to families. The adoption services for Child Safe will be\nprovided primarily in Judson’s Redford, Michigan office; which already holds a separate\nchild placing agency license. Adoption workers will work in both the Redford and Royal\nOak offices.\n2",
    "B. Program Description\nChild Safe of Michigan, an affiliate of Judson Center, will provide comprehensive foster\ncare services, certification services, as well as adoption evaluation and placement\nservices. The Chief Administrator will split time between the Royal Oak and Redford\noffices. A foster care supervisor and certification supervisor are in place, as well as\nsufficient foster care, certification, and adoption staff and supervisor. The Agency will\ncontract with DHS to provide services to include placement and supervision in foster\ncare, adoption evaluation and placement. The Agency will recruit, train, and assess\nfoster families; as well as provide other necessary certification services. Documentation\nincluding the Agency’s organization chart, current budget, and non-profit status were\nreviewed. Agency policies and procedures were reviewed and were found to be in\ncompliance with necessary rules and statutes.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThere are no rule or statutory violations.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend issuance of a provisional license to this child placing agency, private.\n12/17/14\n________________________________________\nPatricia Neitman Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n_\nLinda Tansil Date December 19, 2014\nArea Manager\n3"
