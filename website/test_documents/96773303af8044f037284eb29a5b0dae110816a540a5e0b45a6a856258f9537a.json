    "(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was admitted to the new facility without the requested 30-\nday supply of medication and when provided medication, it was\nthe wrong dose.\nInvestigation Youth A was interviewed via phone on 8/1/23 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS worker. He reported receiving seizure medication\n(one large white pill) twice a day at the detention facility but at\ntimes would stop taking the medication because he “felt weird”. He\nbelieved the dose was “900 something” in the morning and “1500\nsomething” in the evening. Once he had a seizure while playing\nbasketball and woke up in the hospital which resulted in the\nseizure medication. While in the detention facility, when he\nexperienced a seizure, staff would call for medical support. He\nreported being transported to the new facility by the County\nSheriff’s department. He never reported receiving the wrong\nmedication.\nAdministrator 1 and Administrator 2 were interviewed face to\nface at the facility on 8/1/23. They reported Youth A has a\nhistory of seizures and there is a questions if the seizures are real\nor not. Youth A was in the hospital for a week in an effort to\ndetermine if the seizures were real or “something else”. They also\nreported Youth A left the facility for his new placement on 7/28/23.\nThey never reported Youth A received the wrong dose of\nmedication. They sent the medication on hand with instructions in\nthe discharge summary of the dose for Youth A.\nAdministrator 3 and Administrator 4 were interviewed face to\nface at the facility on 8/3/23 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. They reported when a youth is leaving, they will provide a\nsupply of medication that they have on file, and this is outlined in\nthe youth’s discharge summary. They described the process that\ntook place with Youth A being discharged. Probation Officer\nemailed the facility on 7/19/23 notifying them Youth A will be\nreplaced to another facility in a “few weeks”. All of the discharge\ninformation is sent to the Probation Officer to pass along to the\nnext possible placement so they can evaluation information prior\nto accepting a youth. On 7/28/23 the Sheriff’s department\ntransporter showed up unannounced at the facility to transport\nYouth A to his new placement. Nurse 2 was notified by the new\nplacement, that they had not received a 30-day supply of\nmedication for Youth A. Nurse 2 contacted Clinician 1 who gave\npermission for a new prescription which Nurse 2 called into the\nrequested pharmacy (Walgreens in Grayling). A couple of hours\n4",
    "later Administrator 1 notified Administrator 3 the new placement\nhad filed a licensing complaint about not receiving a 30-day supply\nof medication and not receiving the correct dose of medication\nfrom the pharmacy for Youth A. Administrator 2 called the\npharmacy asking why they had not filled the prescription as\nordered. The order was for a supply of 1-300 mg and 2-600 mg\nseizure medication daily to which they provided 3- 300 mg daily.\nWhen Youth A was in the hospital, he received a higher dose of\nmedication which was changed by the treating physician after\nYouth A was found to be within therapeutic limits with a lower\ndose. After the change, the medication stayed at the 1 tab 300 mg\nin the morning and 2 tabs 600 in the evening.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/3/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker.

She also reported Nurse 2 called the pharmacy in\nGrayling (Shawono) to ensure the medication was made available\nto the new placement. She believed the new placement called in a\nprescription for three 300 mg tabs of Trileptal rather than the\ncorrect dose of one 300 tab and two 600 mg tabs, but she is\nunsure where the mistake took place. She reported when\nreceiving the notice (7/18/23) from Probation Officer of Youth A’s\nplanned replacement within the next few weeks, they sent\n(7/19/23) the medical information along with other information\n(Discharge summary) to Probation Officer. Youth A was replaced\non 7/28/23 when the Sheriff’s Office transporter showed up\nunannounced at the facility. This didn’t give the facility 5 to 7 days’\nnotice which they need to prepare all medication for the transfer.\nAdministrator 3 reported they can only order more medication\nafter the on-site supply reaches 5-7 days left and on 7/28/23 they\nhad just reached a 7-day left of the Trileptal.
