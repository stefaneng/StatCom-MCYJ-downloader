EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were 3 incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nAll three of the SER’s related to the child abuse/neglect during this licensing period\nwere reviewed. They were all found to have been completed accurately and\nthoroughly with appropriate recommendations.\nThere were 2 incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nBoth of the SER’s related to corporal punishment during this licensing period were\nreviewed. They were all found to have been completed accurately and thoroughly\nwith appropriate recommendations.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first corrective action plan was submitted in response to licensing interim\ninspection report dated 11/19/2021 and was approved on 12/9/2021. Compliance\nwith that CAP has not been maintained as evidenced by 11 of the 17 violations\nestablished during this period under review being repeat violations of those\naddressed in the 12/9/2021 CAP. Additionally, 8 of the 11 repeat violations were\nalso established in the 2020 renewal inspection for which a CAP was approved\n9/10/2020. Compared to the 2021 inspection, the number of incidents of each\nviolation has decreased slightly in areas such as; face to face visits with youth,\ntimely service plans, and FTMs, has increased in areas such as; action summaries,\n5307s, and supervisory approval of service plans, and has remained the same in\nareas such as; obtaining signatures on PATPs, and medical passports\nThe second corrective action plan was submitted in response to special investigation\nreport 2022C0212013 dated 7/8/2022 for which a CAP was approved on 8/4/2022.\nThe agency is in process of implementing the CAP, and compliance with the CAP\nwill be assessed for 6 months following the approval date.\nThe licensee received a copy of Act 116, the licensing rules promulgated under Act\n116, and the terms of the license. The licensee failed to comply with Act 116, the\n14",
    "licensing rules promulgated under Act116, or the terms of the license and has\ndemonstrated willful and substantial violations when falsifying documentation and\nfailing to maintain complete youth files throughout the licensing period. The files\ncontaining the falsified documents were from multiple supervisors and were\ncompleted by multiple workers.\nChief Administrator Assessment- The chief administrator assessment was\nsubmitted and reviewed on 8/12/2022. The chief administrator identified issues\nrelated to staffing and pandemic related restrictions resulting in areas on non-\ncompliance.\nInterviews – The staff interviewed all reported being supported by their peers and\nimmediate superiors. The foster care workers reported that high caseloads have\nmade it difficult to maintain compliance throughout the year. Two workers reported\nthat the current caseloads are overwhelming and unmanageable. The worker and\nsupervisors interviewed were asked about the falsification of documents. They all\nreported that they were not given any directive to falsify files but were told to correct\nanything they could prior to the inspection. One supervisor and one worker stated that\nit was unclear to them what could be corrected in a file and made individual decisions\nto create and backdate documents. Another supervisor was asked about a backdated\ndocument with her signature. She stated that the document was from a case she\npreviously supervised and the worker she had been supervising at the time emailed\nher the document to sign. The supervisor reported that the signature dates were\nalready filled in by the worker and she didn’t pay attention to them when adding her\nsignature.\nVII. DCWL Analyst Concerns\nNo Safety Concerns Identified.\n15",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or policy.
