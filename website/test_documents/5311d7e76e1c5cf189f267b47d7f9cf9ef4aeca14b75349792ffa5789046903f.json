DCWL\nConsultant 1 was present in-person with Youth A during the\ninterview. Youth A reported that approximately a month ago she\nreturned from AWOL and was at the agency office with Foster\nCare Supervisor.

She stated she went out to lunch at a Hibachi\nrestaurant with a lady she wasn’t able to identify and another 16-\nyear-old girl. When she swiped the gift card to pay there was no\nbalance on the card so the lady she was with had to pay. Youth A\nstated they all went back to the agency office and the lady\nconfronted Foster Care Supervisor about there being no money\non the gift card.
