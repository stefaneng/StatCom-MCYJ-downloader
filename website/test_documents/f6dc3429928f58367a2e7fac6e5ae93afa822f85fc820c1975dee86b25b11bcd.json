    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP submitted was in response to the 2022 licensing inspection report dated\n7/29/2022. The CAP was approved on 8/23/2022 and addressed 11 areas of non-\ncompliance. Two of the 11 non-compliances addressed in the 2022 CAP, PATP\nsignatures and medical passports, were repeated during this inspection and will\nneed additional corrective action planning. It is noted that the areas found in\nviolation appear to be due to paperwork errors (ie failure to upload) and confusion\nregarding updated policy as opposed to failure to complete required tasks.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment identified area in which it is difficult for staff to\nachieve and maintain compliance due to discrepancies with regulatory\nrequirements and the data collected. An example provided was older youth\nmedical care waivers which are allowed per regulation; however, if an older youth\nwaives medical appointments, the data still shows the youth missed a required\nappointment and is reflected on the worker's caseload and the county's overall\ndata as a non-compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe only concerns identified by staff were regarding CWLM. They all report being\nsupported by their peers and superiors and feel they have the tools and resources\nneeded to perform their job functions.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to perform job\nresponsibilities. Case records and physical CHRI are stored in a method that\nprevents unauthorized access through the use of locked cabinets and locked\nstorage shelves.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns identified.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJuly 21, 2023\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 21, 2023\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
