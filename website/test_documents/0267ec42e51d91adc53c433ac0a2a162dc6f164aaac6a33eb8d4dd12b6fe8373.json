    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4160 Emergency restraint.\nSection (1) The use of emergency restraint as a lifesaving response for a\nDescription youth will be limited to:\n(a) An emergency response to protect the youth or others from\nan unanticipated or severely aggressive behavior that places the\nyouth or others at serious threat of violence or injury if no\nimmediate intervention occurs.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 1/10/24 Youth A was observed with bruises and scratches on\nhis body as a result of being restrained by unknown staff\nmembers.\nInvestigation This complaint was received on 01/10/2024 and assigned for joint\ninvestigation with MDHHS Specialist.\nInterviews:\nI contacted complainant on 12/18/2023, no additional information\nwas provided.\nI interviewed Director at the facility, on 01/12/2024, jointly with\nMDHHS Specialist. Director reported on 01/09/2024 they had an\nonsite event for the youths to receive presents. Youth A was\ntriggered because he didn’t like what he received, so when he\nwent back to the cottage he was escalated and hurt himself. Staff\n1 and Staff 2 restrained Youth A because he was hurting himself.\nDirector said Staff 1 did a body chart after the restraint, there were\nno injuries noted and Youth A denied being hurt or injured during\nthe restraint. Director said when Youth A gets triggered, Youth A\nbecomes aggressive and will hurt himself.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility, on 01/12/2024, jointly with the\nMDHHS Specialist. Youth A reported he was restrained last week\nbut could not recall which staff restrained him. Youth A said two\nstaff members put his hands behind his back and restrained him.\nYouth A said he has a bruise on his chest but that was from a fight\nwith Youth B. Youth A denied getting hurt from being restrained.\nYouth A was extremely distracted, unfocused, and difficult to\ninterview.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility, on 01/12/2024, jointly with the\nMDHHS Specialist. Youth B admitted he got into a fight with Youth\nA. He said Youth A swung at him first and he then punched Youth\nA in the chest. Youth B said Staff 3 was there and separated them\nimmediately. He said Youth A was upset because he didn’t like\n2",
    "the present he received. Youth B said later in the evening, Youth\nA was still upset and was yelling and cussing at the staff. Youth B\nadmitted that he tried to kick Youth A when Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere trying to restrain Youth A. Youth B said Staff 3 stopped him\nand directed Youth B to go to his room.\nI interviewed Staff 1 onsite on 01/12/2024, jointly with MDHHS\nSpecialist. Staff 1 is a shift leader, has been working at the agency\nfor 6 months, and is trained in Crisis Prevention and Intervention\n(CPI). He reported on 01/09/2024 Youth A was upset because he\ndidn’t like the gifts he received, became aggressive and hurt\nhimself. Staff 1 said he and Staff 2 attempted to verbally de-\nescalate Youth A, but Youth A continued to escalate and hurt\nhimself. Youth A was restrained to prevent him from hurting\nhimself. Youth A punched the wall, kicked the garbage can, and\nhit his head against a metal box on the wall. Staff 1 and Staff 2 put\nYouth A in a standing restraint for a few seconds, Youth A\ndropped to the floor and Staff 1 and Staff 2 released Youth A.\nYouth A sat on the floor for a few seconds, rocked back and forth,\nand again began to kick and hit his head. He and Staff 2\nattempted to help Youth A get off the floor, Youth A dropped to the\nfloor, kicked Staff 1 and Staff 1 attempted to block the kick and\npushed Youth A’s leg away. Staff 1 said at that point they backed\naway and continued to use verbal de-escalation. A few minutes\nlater, Youth A stood up and went to his room. Staff 1 denied Youth\nA getting hurt or injured as a result of the restraint.\nI spoke with Youth A’s Foster Care Worker via telephone on\n01/22/2024. She reported Youth A has been at the facility for\nalmost two years. Youth A is autistic and when escalated, he\nbecomes aggressive. In August of 2023, Youth A was evaluated\nand diagnosed with Autism. Youth A requires more intensive\ntreatment for his diagnosis; therefore, she is working on finding a\nnew placement to address his needs and treatment. She said\nYouth A denied getting hurt from the restraint.\nI interviewed Staff 2 via telephone on 02/08/2024. Staff 2 recalled\nthe incident on 01/09/2024. Staff 2 said Youth A was triggered\nbecause he didn’t get a sonic toy and became escalated and hit\nhis head against a metal box. He and Staff 1 initially attempted\nverbal de-escalation, but when Youth A hit his head against the\nmetal box, Youth A was put in a standing restraint. Youth A was\nonly restrained for a few seconds because Youth A dropped to his\nknees, so they released the restraint. Staff 1 said Youth A\ncontinued to kick and hurt himself, so they attempted to get him off\n3",
    "the floor. Staff 2 attempted to block Youth A’s kicking and Staff 1\ngrabbed Youth A’s foot and pushed it away. Staff 2 said he and\nStaff 1 moved away from Youth A and continued to use verbal de-\nescalation to avoid Youth A becoming more aggressive. Youth A\neventually calmed down without any other interventions. He\ndenied Youth A was hurt or injured as a result of the restraint.\nOn 02/08/2024 a predisposition conference held with MDHHS\nSpecialist, MDHHS Supervisor, and Foster Care Worker. There is\nno finding.\nVideo Reviewed:\n• Video footage from 01/09/2024 at approximately 8:00 pm\nwas reviewed on 01/12/2024 (Note: there is no audio). The\nvideo starts outside the bedrooms with Staff 1 and Staff 2\nstanding. Youth A kicks the trash can, punches the wall,\nand hits his head twice against the metal box on the wall.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 put Youth A in a two-person standing\nrestraint. Youth A drops down to his knees and Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 release the hold. Youth A sits on the floor, rocks\nback and forth and hits his head on the wall. Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 attempt to help Youth A get off the floor, Youth A\nkicks Staff 1, Staff 1 blocks the kick, grabs Youth A’s foot\nand pushes his foot away. Staff 1 and Staff 2 move away\nas Youth A sits on the floor and starts to rock back and\nforth.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident report dated 01/09/2024 at approximately 6:45 pm\ncompleted by Staff 3.

    "young person until he can regain control of his behavior.\nThis is only used as a last resort, after verbal interventions\nhave been attempted, and the young person presents a\ndanger to self or others.\n• Staff 1 and Staff 2 have no disciplinary action.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as video footage,\ndocumentation, and interviews with staff and youths confirm the\nrestraint was in response to severely aggressive behavior that put\nYouth A at risk of harm. Youth A reported the bruise on his chest\nwas from getting into a fight with Youth B.\nTechnical Assistance:\nProvided technical assistance regarding ensuring staff move away\nfrom a youth when they are kicking to avoid grabbing or touching\nthe youth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.

    "summary": "A special investigation was initiated after a youth was reported to have bruises from a restraint. The investigation found that staff used a brief physical restraint on a youth who was harming himself during a behavioral escalation after an event. Video evidence, interviews, and documentation confirmed the restraint was a last-resort response to prevent self-injury, aligning with emergency protocols, and the youth's bruise was attributed to a separate fight with another youth. The facility was found in compliance with rules, and no policy violations were substantiated, effectively clearing the staff and facility of culpability for the alleged improper restraint.",
