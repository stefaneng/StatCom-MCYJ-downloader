Complainant had nothing additional to report.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on January 18,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth A said he was\nangry with Youth B for calling him a “bitch” after school. Youth A said\nStaff 4 came from behind him and put him in a restraint for going after\nYouth B. Youth A said there were other youth and staff around\nhowever, he was unable to recall any specific names. Youth A said he\nobtained a scratch on his left side and originally said it was from Staff\n4’s keys, then stated it was actually from a clipboard Staff 4 had in his\nhands at the beginning of the restraint, noting he had dropped it during\nthe restraint. Youth A said the restraint lasted “a couple minutes”. Youth\nA said he did not believe Staff 4 intentionally scratched him or meant\nany intentional harm to him, noting he has a good relationship with Staff\n4.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on January 18,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth B said Youth\nA was out of control on Monday after school. Youth B said Youth A was\ntrying “to fight” her outside of the school. Youth B said a staff was\nstanding in front of her however she could not remember who the staff\nwas. Youth B said Staff 4 restrained Youth A because he was being\naggressive and made the comments “I fucking hate you” to her. Youth\nB said she saw the restraint and Staff 4 did not have anything in his\nhands that she saw. Youth B said the restraint looked appropriate to\nher. Youth B said Staff 4 walked Youth A to the bus, and they left.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on January 18,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth C said after\nschool several youth were outside getting ready to go back to their\nhouses when Youth B told Youth A that Youth C does not care about\nhim which upset Youth A. Youth C said Youth B and Youth A then\n“went after each other” and Staff 1 stepped in-between the youth. Youth\nC said that did not work and Youth B kept “going after” Youth A so Staff\n5 put Youth A into a restraint. Youth C said Staff 5 had a pop bottle in\nhis hand, keys were on his belt, and had a clipboard that he set down\nprior to restraining Youth A.
