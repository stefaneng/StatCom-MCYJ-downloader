INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction, prevention;\nTitle prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159\nSection (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nDescription manner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth’s\ntreatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 2/21/24 youth was observed covered with bruises, the right ear\nwas completely black and blue. On the inside of both elbows there\nis a red mark from being restrained by staff who were pulling his\narm. There are scratches on youth’s arms and lower back. The\nbruises on youth’s elbows were sustained from youth being\nrestrained by unknown staff members at the home. It is unknown if\nthe bruises were sustained from a restraint or from being\nphysically attacked by other youths.\nInvestigation This complaint was received on 02/22/2024 and assigned for joint\ninvestigation with MDHHS Specialist.\nInterviews:\nI contacted complainant on 02/22/2024, no additional information\nwas provided.\nI called and emailed Foster Care Worker on 02/22/2024 and\ncommunication was not returned.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the agency on 02/22/2024, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 1 is a youth specialist and has been\nworking at the facility for one year. Staff 1 denied touching or\nphysically managing Youth A. He reported on 02/18/2024 Youth A\nwas mad because he was told he has to eat dinner before he can\nhave cake, so he left the cottage without permission. Staff 1 tried\nto verbally discourage Youth A from leaving the cottage. Staff 1\nfollowed Youth A out of the cottage then drove the agency van,\nand followed Youth A. He saw Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth\nD, and Youth E around the area by the administration building.\nYouth A had a stick and had hit Youth B with it. Youth B in\n2",
    "response, tried to hit Youth A. Staff 1 got out of the van and\nredirected the youths to stop fighting. Staff 1 said Staff 2 had\nredirected the other youths to go back to the cottage. Youth A ran\noff towards the main road and the four other youths walked back\nto the cottage with Staff 2. Staff 1 followed Youth A with the van\nslowly and tried talking to Youth A in attempt to get him to come\nback to the cottage. Youth A ran in front of the van into the\nwooded area towards six-mile road. Once Staff 1 lost sight of\nYouth A, Staff 1 drove to the police department to file a missing\nperson report. When Staff 1 arrived at the police department, he\nwas informed Youth A had already been picked up by the police.\nThe police dropped Youth A off at the campus and Staff 1\ncompleted an incident report. He said Youth A is easily triggered\nwhen he does not get his way and will hit himself. Staff 1 denied\nhe or any other staff physically managed Youth A.

He denied witnessing\nany bruises or marks on Youth A that evening.\nI interviewed Youth A at the agency on 02/22/2024, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist.

Director reported Youth A\nwas not restrained in the month of February.\nA predisposition conference held with MDHHS Specialist on\n03/21/2024. There is no finding by MDHHS Specialist.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Facility Restraint Policy. Crisis Prevention Institute-\nNonviolent Crisis Intervention The staff approach is to apply\nnonviolent physical crisis intervention, which is a safe, non-\nharmful control and restraint position to safely control a\nyoung person until he can regain control of his behavior.\nThis is only used as a last resort, after verbal interventions\nhave been attempted, and the young person presents a\ndanger to self or others.\n• Methodist Intervention Standards and Prohibitions Policy\noutlines discipline standards for youth. The agency\nprohibits any form of corporal punishment and/or\ninappropriate hands-on intervention such as but not limited\nto; pinching, spanking, slapping, hitting, twisting arms,\npaddling, pulling hair, grabbing, pushing, and threatening\ngestures.\n• Personnel file for Staff 1 was reviewed and there were no\ndisciplinary action noted.\n• Incident report dated 02/18/2024, noted Youth A was\ntriggered because he wanted cake for dinner.
