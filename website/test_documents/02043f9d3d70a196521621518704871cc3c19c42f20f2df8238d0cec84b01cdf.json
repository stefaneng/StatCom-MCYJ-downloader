    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted following an allegation that a youth, referred to as Youth A, was sexually abused by a peer at the Methodist Children's Home several years prior. The investigation found insufficient evidence to substantiate the claims, as the youth declined to provide specific details or names, current staff had no recollection of such incidents, and a review of records from the time period showed no reports of Youth A as a victim. Given the lack of corroborating evidence and the explicit conclusion of the state investigator, no policy or code violations were established against the facility.",
