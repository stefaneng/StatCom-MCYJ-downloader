He reports being aware of\nthe allegations and having put a safety plan in place that restricts Staff 1 from any\ncontact with Resident A. He also reports that Resident A is in isolation as any new\nresident would be, because of the COVID restrictions.

He stated, “I was getting\nResident B out of his room and standing in the common area when Staff 1 came\nonto the Pod. He went to Resident A’s room, put up the curtain and walked into the\nroom”. Staff 2 reports hearing Staff 1 say “get down off there” and that Staff 1\nappeared to be “scolding Resident A”. Staff 2 also reported that in the past, the\nfacility had a resident who was standing on the sink and fell, getting hurt, so staff\nwant residents to stay off the sink. Staff 2 reported that Staff 1 was showing\nfrustration and should have had another staff observe him when he went into the\nbedroom.

He ended by reporting that “the allegations don’t sound like anything\nStaff 1 would do because he is very helpful to the kids here”. Staff 2 did report that\nstaff are to have another staff present if they are going into a resident’s room for\nsafety of the resident and staff.\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed the personnel file of Staff 1. The following information was documented in\nthe personnel file.\n 10/13/2009 a report was written in which it was stated, “your use of profanity\nand telling the residents not to bother filing grievances as they do no good\nand do not ‘go anywhere’.” This document was stated to have as\ndocumentation of the discussion with Staff 1 and the Chief Administrator.\n Documentation of a written reprimand for leaving the building without\nappropriate notification took place on 12/15/2009.

I told all the resident the day\nbefore that if they were yelling, I was going to put up their curtain they all said ok.\nAfter I put up his curtain and went to talk with him about his profanity he was up\non the desk. I told him to get down and told him the story about the resident and I\ntold him that I would let his curtain down if he would follow the rule. Didn’t touch\nthe kid at all.\nThe resident version on this incident report had the following documentation: “Staff 1\ngrabbed my neck and genitals”.\nDisciplinary Action Authorized: “Staff 1 removed from resident area pending\ninvestigation”.\nI reviewed the “Incident Report dated 10/14/2020 involving the allegations signed by\nStaff 2. The incident is described:",
    "I was getting Resident B up for his court hearing. I was heading to the door to the\ncourtyard when I saw Staff 1 enter the pod and approach room B112. Staff 1 put\nup his curtain and opened his door. I stayed on the side so that there was\nsomeone observing staff as they entered a kid’s room. I did witness Staff 1\npointing his finger stride up to Resident A and holler to the resident to stop yelling\nand cursing. He also yelled at Resident A to get down from his sink, which\nResident A did, or he could end up like another resident that fell and broke his\ntooth. Staff 1 also start walking to leave the room when he told Resident A that\nhe heard him yelling his name about something and told him to stop yelling his\nname while in his room. I did not observe Staff 1 put his hands-on Resident A in\nany way. I, however, did see Resident A with hands balled up, walk up to Staff 1,\nand stand next to him while Staff 1 was by the doorway before exited his room.\nThe resident version on this incident report had the following documentation:\n“Accused Staff 1 of assaulting him”.\nI reviewed the written statement by Resident A dated 10/14/2020. The statement\nprovided the following documentation:\nSo I was talking to (unknown resident) and Staff 1 said I was yelling and put my\nmat up and I don’t know what I said. He came back and said what did you say, I\nsaid I didn’t say anything, and he choked me and grabbed by private part. And\nsaid if I told anybody something would happen.\nI reviewed the written statement by Resident B dated 10/14/2020. The statement\nprovided the following documentation:\nThis happened at about 2:30. I was just getting out of my room for court.\nResident A had said something to Staff 1 and he had put his mat up on his door.\nThen Resident A had (unable to read this section) then Staff 1 had opened his\ndoor and then he was screaming, and Resident A door was open then me and\nStaff 2 and everybody was looking. Then Resident A was screaming loud now he\nwas looking, and I see Resident A getting tossed around like a ball and\neverybody was looking.\nI reviewed the written statement by Resident C dated 10/14/2020. The statement\nprovided the following documentation:\nSo I was in my room and I heard B112 saying don’t put your hand on me, so I get\nup to see what going on and I see Staff 1 go in there.\nI reviewed the nursing email dated 10/15/20. This document stated the following:\nYesterday (10-14-20) I was asked to check on Resident A. This was after the\ndoctor and I saw him around 10:30 AM at which time he did not discuss any\nproblems or injuries. When I checked on him in the afternoon he said “my neck is",
    "sore, someone choked me yesterday” I could see no visible redness, swelling or\nbruising on his neck or head. He denied any other injuries. I have documented\nthis in his medical chart in my office. I did not go into details of the incident with\nhim other than his reported injury/pain. Supervisors were already aware of the\nincident as one of them asked me to assess this injury.\nI reviewed the facility policy “2.17 personnel standards of conduct”. Item five reads:\nDeveloping relationships with juveniles other than what is necessary in the\nnormal conduct of the facility, staff shall not use their position to become\nemotionally, physically and/or romantically involved with juveniles.\nI reviewed the facility policy “2.17a Professional Boundaries: Employee Relationship\nwith Residents and their Family Members”. Item B states:\nEstablishing inappropriate boundaries with residents wherein the boundaries of a\nstaff/resident relationship are blurred (i.e., developing friendships with residents\nand/or their families, keeping secrets with residents and/or their families, etc.).\nAttempting to impose personal values (i.e., religion, issues of morality) on\nresidents.\nI reviewed the facility policy “4.7 Rules and Discipline Resident Management. States:\nItem 3.J: Examples of staff failure to comply with the policy shall include, but not\nbe limited to: Shouting and screaming at residents.\n4.D: Serve as models for resident behavior.\n4.D: Examples of successful compliance with their policy shall include:\nReacting to a resident’s inappropriate behavior in a calm emotionally neutral\nmanner\nI reviewed the facility policy “4.8 Rules and Discipline Resident Rights.

Shouting or screaming at residents.\nF.5: Shall contribute individually to maintaining a therapeutic environment.\nReacting to a resident’s inappropriate behavior in a calm emotionally neutral\nmanner\nI reviewed the facility policy “5.6 Safety and Security - Security Checks/Supervision”.\nStates:\nItem B.3: The shift supervisor should be made aware if assistance is needed\nwhen conducting visual checks.\nNote: Visual checks are done to ensure the safety of the resident and security of\nthe building. It is required that you visually confirm the presence and safety of the",
    "resident. This may require opening the resident’s room door to verify their\npresence.\nI reviewed the video recording provided by the facility of the area outside of Resident\nA’s room and on the day the allegations took place. A review of the video recording\nis as follows:\n 2:14:57.403 PM 10/13/20 Video begins. The view is from the southeast\ncorner of the common area.

    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10169 Discipline.\nA facility shall have and follow written policy and procedure\nwhich stipulates that residents shall not be subjected to any of\nthe following:\nHumiliation.\nANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews, written documentation\nand a video recording does not support the allegations of Staff 1\nphysically abusing Resident A. The video recording does not\nprovide evidence either way because there is no clear view of\nthe interaction between Staff 1 and Resident A in his room. The\ntwo witnesses that had somewhat of a view of the room only\nhad a narrow view into the room and were very limited in what\nthey would have been able to view. However, given the verbal\nreports and written statements, there is evidence to support that\nStaff 1 did not provided the type of behavior management that is\nrequired by the facility. His self-report of yelling and lecturing\nResident A goes against the facility policy/procedures in regard\nto behavior management for residents.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10103 Program statement.\nWritten policies and procedures pertaining to the admission,\ncare, and release of residents.",
    "ANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews, written documentation,\nand a video recording support the allegation that Staff 1 did not\nfollow the policy/procedure for supervision of Resident A. He\nwent into Resident A’s room with the door shut for\napproximately three minutes. Staff 1 opened the door a couple\nof inches and was not seen for an additional three and a half\nminutes. This action is not what is required in the\npolicy/procedure for Security checks/Supervision. The other\nevidence of Staff 1 not following the policy/procedures of the\nfacility occurred when he failed to serve as a positive role model\nwhen he was yelling and lecturing Resident A.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nWith an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that no change be\nmade to the license of this Court Operated Facility.\n11/4/2020\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 5, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager"
