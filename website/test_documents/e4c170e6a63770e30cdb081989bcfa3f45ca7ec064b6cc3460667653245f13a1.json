Reviewed video.\n02/11/2022 Contact - Document Received\nEmails exchanged with Director.\n02/24/2022 Contact - Document Received\nDocuments received via email from Director.\nALLEGATION:\nOn 1/26/22, youth was held in a prone restraint for over 4 minutes. Additionally, the\ninitiation of the restraint did not follow facility policy.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring a review of the 01/26/22 restraint of Youth A, additional details were asked of\nthe facility Director to clarify the initiation of the restraint and the youth being held in\n2",
    "a prone position. The Director reported that during the initiation of the restraint, Staff\n2 entered the room and attempted to put Youth A into a restraint, but his momentum\ntook them to the floor. The Director also clarified that Youth A was held in a prone\nposition for several minutes due to her struggling and due to the staff reporting it\nwould not have been safe to roll her to a supine position. No injuries were reported.\nI interviewed the Director and the Administrator at the facility on 02/10/22. A review\nof the video of this incident occurred during this meeting. The video showed the\nfollowing: Youth A and Staff 1 were observed sitting in the day room when Youth A\nthrew a pitcher of water at Staff 1 without any signs of physical escalation. Youth A\ngot up and moved toward Staff 1, who was backing away from her. Staff 2 entered\nthe room and approached Youth A quickly from behind. Staff 2 wrapped his arms\naround Youth A in a tackle type manner, and they fell forward onto a large foam\nottoman. Youth A was face down. Staff 1 helped secure Youth A and held her left\narm while Staff 2 held Youth A’s right arm. This was observed about 6:11:24 and\nYouth A was half on and half off the ottoman. Her face and upper torso on the floor\nand her waist and legs still on the ottoman. Staff 4 entered and tried to get ahold of\nYouth A’s feet and Youth A slid off the ottoman. This was about 6:11:58. Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 continued holding Youth A in a prone position on the floor while Staff 4 went\nto retrieve mechanical restraints. About 6:13:15, Staff 3 entered and moved some\nfurniture to clear the area. Youth A was seen moving against staff at times during the\nrestraint. Once Staff 4 brought the mechanical restraints, Staff 3 put them on Youth\nA. Once Youth A had leg and arm restraints on, the staff disengaged from the\nrestraint, but Youth A stayed in a prone position on the floor. This was observed at\nabout 6:17:30. Staff 2 appeared to say something to Staff 1, and Staff 1 left the area.\nThe remaining three staff talk to Youth A. About 6:18:58, the staff assisted Youth A\nin rolling over and they helped her up to her feet and escorted her out of the area.\nYouth A walked freely at this time.\nBoth the Director and Administrator agreed that the initiation of the restraint was not\nin line with their restraint model, Handle With Care. Additionally, they both agreed\nthat the youth was held for an extended period in a prone position and understood\nthat was against Department policy and their own restraint policy, which notes no\nprone restraints.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows:\n Incident Report for Youth A, dated 01/26/22, submitted by the Program\nManager. The report was consistent with the video and the reports by the\nDirector and Administrator.\n Incident Review Form, completed by the Program Manager, 01/27/22. Noted\n‘PRT which led to a prone hold which is prohibited.’\n Facility policy 9.13 Use of Force: the policy requires restraints to be done in a\nsafe and appropriate manner, done in line with provided restraint training, and\nprohibits prone restraints.\n Staff training documentation was verified for both Staff 1 and Staff 2 and\nnoted to be current.\n3",
    " Disciplinary action was reviewed for Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 1 was reported\nnot to have any disciplinary action. Staff 2 had a disciplinary action form in his\nfile that was dated 2016 for not following restraint protocol.\n Performance Feedback form for Staff 1 related to this incident, dated\n02/22/22, noted Staff 1 did not follow protocol by holding youth prone and not\nmaking attempts to reposition her.\n Performance Feedback form for Staff 2 related to this incident, dated\n02/22/22, noted Staff 2 did not follow protocol by not following Handle With\nCare at the initiation of the restraint, as Staff 2 used more of a tackle, rather\nthan the Primary Restraint Technique in Handle With Care. It was additionally\nnoted that Staff 2 did not follow protocol by holding youth prone and not\nmaking attempts to reposition her.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand procedures regarding restraint. These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their\nfamilies, and referring agencies.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of\nthe minor child’s behavior, chronological and\ndevelopmental age, size, gender, physical condition,\nmedical condition, psychiatric condition, and personal\nhistory, including any history of trauma, and done in a\nmanner consistent with the resident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as evidenced by the video of\nthis restraint showing Youth A was tackled from behind and\nrestrained prone for several minutes. The video and these\nfindings were reviewed with the Director and Administrator who\nboth agreed with the stated violation. The actions taken by staff,\nto hold Youth A in this manner, were not safe or appropriate and\nviolated the facility policy.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nMarch 10, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 14, 2022\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
