INVESTIGATION\nR 400.12214 Compliance with 1975 PA 238.\nViolation An agency shall develop a written plan and implement the\nType plan to assure compliance with 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.621,\nand known as the child protection law.\nAllegation It is alleged that the agency failed to report suspected child\nabuse/neglect.\nInvestigation The Complainant was interviewed via telephone on May 25,\n2023, and July 20, 2023. The Complainant offered the following\ninformation. During a Team Decision Meeting on April 24, 2023,\nStaff 1, an agency worker, had stated in a de-briefing after the\nFTM that Youth A, a foster child, had told her that her brother had\ngrouped her buttocks several times. Youth A and her brother, age\n18, reside with their grandmother. The Complainant, who was\npresent at the meeting, informed the agency that a complaint\nneeded to be filed to Central Intake. The Complainant was\nconcerned that a complaint had not been filed until April 25, 2023.\nThe complainant was also concerned that a complaint had not\nbeen filed earlier when the agency had learned that Youth A had\nbeen touched a few years ago by her brother.\nThe agency Chief Administrator was informed of the\ncomplaint via telephone on May 31, 2023. At that time the Chief\nAdministrator was interviewed. The Chief Administrator reported\nthat Staff 2, who was the agency case worker for Youth A from\nApril 1, 2022, to February 27, 2023, had reported previously that\nYouth A had told her that her brother had touched her a few years\nago but denied that he had touched her breasts or genitals. Youth\nA had gone AWOL from the grandmother’s house on February 20,\n2023, and returned on April 17, 2023. The Chief Administrator\nreported that Youth A had reported to Staff 2 that she went AWOL\nbecause her brother was saying mean things to her. The Chief\nAdministrator reported that Staff 2 had reported that Youth A had\nnot disclosed any other information regarding being touched by\nher brother.\n2",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed via video on June 27, 2023. Also\npresent was the Chief Administrator and Program Supervisor.\nStaff 2 reported that Youth A had disclosed to her that her brother\nhad touched her when they were watching a movie and this\nhappened years ago. Staff 2 reported that Youth A had said that\nhe brushed her arm but denied that her brother had touched her\ninappropriately. Staff 2 reported that when Youth A had gone\nAWOL that Youth A texted her stating that her brother had said\nhurtful things to her and he wants to hate her because he wants to\nlive with their grandmother alone.\nThe Program Supervisor confirmed the above statements of Staff\n2.\nThe Chief Administrator reported that Staff 1 was assigned the\ncase on February 27, 2023, until June 19, 2023, when she left the\nagency. The Chief Administrator reported that Staff 1 had reported\nthat Youth A had disclosed that her buttocks had been grabbed by\nher brother. The Chief Administrator referred me to a social work\ncontact dated April 24, 2023, which describes the disclosure of the\ntouching.\nThe Program Supervisor was interviewed on July 20, 2023,\nvia telephone. The Program Supervisor confirmed she was\npresent at the April 24, 2023, TDM and the de-briefing afterwards.\nThe Program Supervisor reported that she could not recall if the\ndisclosure of the alleged touching had been disclosed and\ndiscussed at the TDM or de-briefing. The Program Supervisor\nreported that she informed Staff 1 to call Central Intake on April\n25, 2023, when Staff 1 obtained more detailed information about\nthe alleged inappropriate touching and informed her about it.\nStaff 1 was not interviewed as she had left the agency and could\nnot be contacted.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nFile Review:\nSocial work contact. An April 17, 2023, contact was reviewed.\nThe contact, written by Staff 1, describes a post AWOL de-briefing\nand questions asked of Youth A. Youth A’s response as to why\nshe went AWOL is as follows, “arguments with brother, possible\nviolation of boundaries, unspecified and would not speak further\non this issue enough to clarify what was going on, only that her\nbrother was creepy to her”.\n3",
    "Social work contact. An April 24, 2023, contact was reviewed.\nThe contact describes Staff 1 asking Youth A what exactly\nhappened between her and her brother. Youth A then reports that\nstarting at age 11 her brother had grouped her buttocks 5 or 6\ntimes and again as recently as December 2022 or January 2023.\nEmail correspondence: An email correspondence, dated April\n28, 2023, between the DHHS Monitor/Complainant, and the\nagency Chief Administrator, was reviewed. The Complainant\nexpresses concern about Youth A being touched by her brother\nyears prior in a “flirtatious” manner and why the agency did not file\na complaint when learning of this behavior. The Chief\nAdministrator reported that the agency worker for Youth A had\nstated that Youth A had reported she feels safe around her\nbrother and that she ran away from her grandmother’s home\nbecause her brother said mean things to her.\nAnalysis The Complainant reported that Staff 1 had disclosed in a post\nTDM de-briefing on April 24, 2023, that Youth A had disclosed to\nher that her brother had grouped her buttocks several times. The\nComplainant informed Staff 1 that she needed to file a complaint\nregarding the allegation.\nThe Program Supervisor could not recall if the above conversation\noccurred during the de-briefing.\nThe social work contact dated April 17, 2023, describes a possible\nviolation of boundaries with her brother and that Youth A thinks he\nis creepy.\nThe social work contact dated April 24, 2023, documents how\nYouth A had reported to Staff 1 that her brother had grabbed her\nbuttocks several times.\nStaff 1 and the agency failed to call Central Intake until April 25,\n2023, a full day after the alleged touching.\nIn addition, the agency had sufficient evidence on April 17, 2023,\nto suspect that inappropriate touching may have been occurring\nand did not file a complaint until April 25, 2023.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n4",
