    "10/12/2021 Contact - Telephone call made\nDiscussed if the Reporting Source had any additional information.\n10/14/2021 Exit Conference\nWith the agency Director of Child Welfare Programs.\nALLEGATION:\nYouth A was dismissed from the agency on 7/14/21 after going AWOL. On\n9/2/21, Youth A had his own medications as well as another youth’s\nmedications from the agency. The agency was informed about the\nmedication. The agency informed the Reporting Source to dispose of the\nadditional medication.\nINVESTIGATION:\n This investigation was initiated on 9/17/21. Both Youth A and Youth B went\nAWOL from the program. Youth A was discharged from the agency on\n7/2/2021. Youth B was discharged from the agency on 6/26/2021.\n Youth A nor Youth B were interviewed for this investigation.\nI interviewed the Reporting Source regarding this allegation. She reported that\nYouth A informed his foster parent on 9/2/21 that he had another youth medication\nfrom Methodist Children Home. She said the foster parent provided Youth B’s\nmedication to her. She said she learned of this incident recently. The Reporting\nSource said she called the agency and reported the medication mishap. She said\nshe was informed by the agency representative to dispose of the medication\nbecause both youths were discharged from the agency. The Reporting Source\nreported the medications were Ibuprofen 600mg and Methocarbamol 500mg. She\nsaid the\nMethocarbamol 500mg is for muscle spasms. She did not have any additional\ninformation to add.\nI interviewed the agency Director of Child Welfare Programs. She reported\nYouth A was placed in the independent living program on 3/19/21 and went AWOL\nfrom 5/22-5/25, 6/10-6/19, and lastly on 7/14. She said the agency had submitted a\n30-day notice to send Youth As case back to DHHS after his second AWOL on\n6/10/21.\nShe said Youth A’s DHHs caseworker emailed the agency foster care supervisor on\n7/21/21 after his 3rd AWOL, indicating that she had a colleague that would be in the\narea on 7/22/21 for a training, and was hoping she could pick up Youth As\n3",
    "medication and belongings. She said the agency foster care supervisor indicated\nthat this would not be a problem and notified the ILP cottage supervisor indicating\nthat this would be occurring. On 7/22/21 a DHHS employee came to pick up the\nmedication from the cottage. The cottage supervisor provided the medications to the\nDHHS employee. The medications were in a plastic bag, which included Youth A’s\nsavings.\nThe Director of Child Welfare Program said on 09/17/2021 the agency foster care\nsupervisor received an email from DHHS indicating that another youth's medication\nwas provided to DHHS in error. She said the youth is no longer in the program, and\nthe only medication that he had been prescribed was an over-the-counter\nprescription for Motrin, that he was taking for an ankle injury, but was no longer\ntaking due to no longer being in the program. The worker said she believe that\nYouth A’s medication was stuck to Youth B’s and the medication was grabbed in\nerror.\nThe Director did not discuss the agency policy on handling of medication when a\nyouth is no longer in the program.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12503 Policy and procedures\n(2) The policies and procedures shall cover at least all of\nthe following areas:\n(h) Medical, dental, and mental health care.\nANALYSIS: It is a fact that Youth A had Youth B’s medication in his\npossession and reported it to his foster parent who gave it to\nYouth A’s caseworker. It is a fact that Youth A and Youth B\nwere not in the agency and neither were taking the medication.\nThe agency Director of Child Welfare Programs said she believe\nthat Youth A’s medication was stuck to Youth B’s and the\nmedication was grabbed in error. Based on the information\nprovided, the agency is found in violation with this rule.\nHandling of medications of any kind needs to be handled with\ncaution and within the agency policy and procedures outline for\nmedications. The agency is asked to develop a plan for\ndisposing of medication and/or assuring that medication is\nprovided to the correct youth upon discharge.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend that Methodist\nChildren's Home Society license remains unchanged.\n10/27/2021\n________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 27, 2021\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
