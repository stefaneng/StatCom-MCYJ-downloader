A phone conference occurred\non 12/14/22 to discuss allegation and investigation.\nAdministrator was interviewed via TEAMS on 12/15/22. Administrator\nreported having very little knowledge about the special evaluation (SE).\nThe SE was completed as a courtesy due to both foster parents being\nemployees of other DHHS offices. Administrator recalled Licensing\nWorker was assigned to the SE and found the process challenging due\nto the foster parents being DHHS county office employees, children’s\nservices involvement, and having multiple counties involved, but also\nneeding to maintain confidentiality.\nLicensing Worker was interviewed face-to-face at the agency on\n12/16/22. Licensing Worker reported that upon completion of the SE,\n2",
    "Children’s Services determined their case was “confirmed”. However,\nthe family would not be placed on Central Registry due to changes in\nthe Child Protection Law effective 11/1/22. Licensing Worker reported\nhe spoke with Licensing Supervisor 1 about the recommendation in the\ninvestigation and determined a recommendation of a 1st provisional\nlicense may be appropriate, rather than a recommendation to revoke\nthe license. Licensing Worker indicated this recommendation was\ninitially made based on several factors: this was the first incident in the\nfoster home; the foster parents were transparent, remorseful, and\nforthcoming with information, accepted responsibility and committed to\nrectifying the situation; foster care workers and parents of the children\nplaced in the home had very positive experiences with the foster\nparents and no concerns; the foster parents self-implemented a\ncorrective action plan (CAP) before the SE commenced; the foster\nparents began couples counseling, individual therapy, training about\nparenting skills, and contact with a physician to review a prescription\nmedication as the foster parents believed the medication caused the\nfoster parent to act in an uncharacteristic manner.\nLicensing Worker stated his understanding of the new child protection\nlaw was that a foster parent placed on central registry automatically\nmeant revocation of a foster home license. However, a “confirmed”\ncase gave the agency some discretion about the recommendation.\nLicensing Worker included that the SE report does not allow for the\nworker to explain the rational for the recommendation. It was believed if\nDAU did not agree with the recommendation or had questions, the\nagency would be contacted to discuss if another recommendation was\nmore appropriate.\nWhen asked if anyone instructed or pressured Licensing Worker about\nthe recommendation, he stated no. Licensing Worker reported there\nwas a lot of communication and discussion among Children’s Services\nWorker and agency directors about all options and what they would\nmean for the foster parents/DHHS employees. The discussion was due\nto the Child Protection Law changing in the middle of this investigation\nand how it impacted findings for Children’s Services. Licensing Worker\ndid not feel like there was pressure for a certain recommendation.\nLicensing Worker stated, in his opinion, the Children’s Services worker\nis a person of great integrity and could not have been swayed one way\nor another if anyone tried. After receiving the findings from children’s\nservices, Licensing Worker spoke with Licensing Supervisor 1 about\nthe investigation and agreed on the recommendation, indicating this is\nthe recommendation they would have made regardless of the foster\nparents being DHHS staff.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 was interviewed face-to-face on 12/16/22 at the\nagency. Licensing Supervisor 1 stated with the recent changes to Child\n4",
    "Protection Law it is still clear that placement on Central Registry would\nrequire revocation. However, the supervisor believed if the case was\nconfirmed, the agency was not required to recommend revocation.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 stated she and Licensing Worker determined\ntheir initial recommendation by looking at the rule violations, if they\nwere correctable, and how the foster parents could come into\ncompliance. Licensing Supervisor 1 felt a CAP alone was not enough,\nbut revocation may be too much. With the foster parents already taking\nsteps to come into compliance, before violations were determined, the\nagency believed compliance could be possible with a CAP and six-\nmonth increased supervisory period during a 1st provisional license.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 felt the 1st provisional recommendation was\nappropriate for this situation, citing the same reasons Licensing Worker\nreported. Licensing Supervisor 1 added that the foster home’s capacity\nhad also been decreased. Licensing Supervisor 1 believed if DAU\ndisagreed with the recommendation, they may have a conference to\ndiscuss it.\nWhen asked if anyone pressured the agency into one recommendation\nversus another, Licensing Supervisor 1 stated she did not feel\npressured. However, there were meetings held with the directors of the\ncounties the foster parents worked for, in which the directors were clear\nthey did not want their staff placed on central registry. Children’s\nServices Worker discussed how the findings may have gone one way\nbefore the 11/1/22 law change, and another after the change. Licensing\nSupervisor 1 stated the Children’s Services Worker was not someone\nwho would let people sway her recommendation, no matter how\nunhappy it made others.\nChildren’s Services Worker (CSW) was interviewed via TEAMS on\n1/5/23. CSW explained the investigation findings did not meet the\ncriteria for placement on Central Registry, therefore the case was\ncompleted as “confirmed”. CSW clarified that prior to 11/1/22, this case\nmay have resulted in placement on Central Registry, but that likely\nwould have been decided by a supervisor. CSW stated there was no\ninjury to any children in the home and that would have been a\nconsideration.\nRegardless, during the investigation, the family was very cooperative\nand remorseful. CSW was impressed by their commitment and\ndetermination to address the problems identified. CSW reported the\nfoster parents began taking classes, attending therapy, and spoke with\na physician immediately after the incident. CSW recently had contact\nwith the family again and found the home to be much more relaxed.\nCSW stated she had high hopes for these parents as they have a lot of\nlove to give and the kids are doing well in the home. By all accounts\n4",
    "from foster care staff, parents, and school staff, this is a great foster\nhome. It is believed the situation requiring investigation likely happen\ndue to multiple stressors at once and a medical issue.\nCSW reported she did not witness pressure from anyone toward\nLicensing Worker 1 to make a specific recommendation. However,\nduring the investigation it was unclear if the investigation would be\ncompleted before 11/1/22, or after. CSW reported the two agency\ndirectors from the counties which the foster parents were employed,\nindicated they wanted CSW to wait until after 11/1/22 to complete the\ninvestigation. This was likely due to the impact CSW’s findings would\nhave on employment of both staff. CSW informed the directors that she\nwould not delay her findings and she would make the appropriate\nrecommendation, regardless of the fact the people being investigated\nwere also DHHS staff. CSW said she explained this to the directors on\na few occasions. In the end, after interviews were completed and report\nrevisions made, the report was not approved until after 11/1/22.\nTherefore, resulting in a “confirmed case” for the foster parents. The\ndirectors took some time but came to understand the reasoning for\nCSW’s findings.\nLicensing Supervisor 2 was interviewed via TEAMS on 1/10/23.\nLicensing Supervisor 2 is from the agency that holds the license for the\nfoster home that was investigated. This agency is also the employer of\none of the foster parents. Licensing Supervisor 2 stated she was\nsupportive of the agency’s recommendation for a 1st provisional and felt\nit was appropriate for the investigation findings. Licensing Supervisor 2\nreported this foster home had not had any prior concerns; no pattern or\ntrends to consider. The family was going through a very difficult time,\nwhich they took responsibility for and were addressing.\nLicensing Supervisor 2 reported she did not witness anyone trying to\ninfluence a decision made by the agency regarding the license\nrecommendation. There were several open conversations about what\nmay or may not happen, and why decisions were made the way they\nwere. There were a lot of “what if’s” in discussion as the law change\ncreated new territory for all people involved and they were attempting to\nunderstand what that meant. Licensing Supervisor 2 did not witness\nanyone ask Children’s Services to delay their findings until after\n11/1/22.\nDocuments reviewed:\nFoster Home Special Evaluation 2022C0631296, completed by\nHillsdale DHHS on 12/7/22. The investigation determined a domestic\nviolence incident occurred between the foster parents, while one foster\nparent was holding a child. The child was not injured. A violation of\nRule 9201(j) was cited, in addition to children services determining a\nconfirmed case. Initially the agency recommended a 1st provisional\n4",
    "license. However, after consultation with the DAU, the agency\nrecommended a revocation of the foster home license.\nAnalysis Based on the interviews there is no evidence the agency made an\nimproper recommendation. The agency made a recommendation they\nbelieved to be consistent with the findings of the investigation. There\nwas no evidence the agency was encouraged to make a different\nrecommendation due to the foster parent’s employment with DHHS.\nConsultation:\nConsultation was provided to Licensing Supervisor 1 to contact DCWL\nwhenever they have questions about a recommendation, or they are\nunsure of which recommendation to make. Specifically, regarding\nconfirmed cases with Children’s Services, as this is a new process.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, and policy. It is recommended\nthat the current license status be continued.\n_ _______________April 17, 2023___________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 18, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
