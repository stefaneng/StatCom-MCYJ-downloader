    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that Youth A was looked at by another unknown youth\nwhile taking showers during the weekend of 3/16-3/17/24.\nUnknown staff were there but did not see.\nStaff (unknown) did not do anything when they heard this\nhappened.\nInvestigation On 3/19/24, I left a voicemail for Foster Care Worker 1 and\nComplainant 1.\nOn 3/26/24, I spoke to Administrator 1. Administrator 1 reported\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were working the day of the allegations. The\nspecific date was unknown at the time of the phone call.\nAdministrator 1 reported Staff 1 was sitting in the chair in the\nbathroom and Staff 2 was out in the hallway directly across from\nthe bathroom. Administrator 1 reported there is a large barrier\nbetween the showers, and it would not be possible for youth to\nlook into another youth’s shower. Administrator 1 reported they do\nhave a video clip of Staff 2 sitting in the hallway during showers.\nOn 4/11/24, I received a phone call from Foster Care Worker 1.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported she was unaware of any details to\nthis specific incident.\nOn 4/11/24, I received a phone call from Complainant 1. No new\ninformation was provided.\nInterviews were conducted face to face at the facility on 3/29/24\nunless otherwise specified.\n2",
    "Interviews:\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported over the weekend of 3/16 and 3/17, he was\ntaking a shower in the bathroom and thought he saw a shadow.\nYouth A reported he did not see anyone looking at him. Youth A\nreported he was in the last shower and Youth B was in the first\nshower. Youth A reported there are two showers in between them.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 was sitting in the bathroom the entire\ntime he was showering. Youth A reported he heard Youth B drop\nsomething in his shower and just “freaked out.” Youth A reported\nthat staff did listen to him after the incident and were trying to help\nhim.\nYouth B:\nYouth B reported about two to three weeks ago, Youth A stated a\ncomment in their group that “something happened.” No one knew\nwhat he was talking about. Youth B did not know what had been\nsaid that happened in the bathroom. Once Youth B was informed\nthat Youth A reported there was a shadow in the bathroom, Youth\nB reported he never left his shower stall at any time. Youth B\nreported staff are always sitting in the bathroom and a staff in the\nhallway watch the bathroom. Youth B reported youth are to take\nshowers in stall 1 and stall 4. Youth B reported there are two stalls\nin between them.\nStaff 1\nStaff 1 reported he was working the day that Youth A reported he\nsaw a shadow in the bathroom. Staff 1 reported no youth left their\nshowers at any time. Staff 1 reported youth use the 1st and 4th\nstalls in the bathroom when showering and a staff sits in the\nbathroom between them. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was sitting\noutside the bathroom in the hallway with direct line of sight into the\nbathroom; able to see him and the showers. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A was upset that Youth B was leaving the program. When a\nyouth leaves a program, they can “pass down” their specific job\nthey have been responsible for in the program. Youth B held the\nsecretarial position. Youth A was upset at Youth B because he did\nnot get the position passed down to him and Staff 1 felt that this\nwas Youth A’s way of trying to get Youth B in trouble.\nStaff 2:\nStaff 2 reported she was working the night of the allegations. Staff\n2 reported she was sitting in the hallway and Staff 1 was sitting in\nthe bathroom between the two showers. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nwas in shower 1 and Youth B was in shower 4. Staff 2 reported\n3",
    "Youth A stated he saw a shadow, but no one ever left their shower\nstall.\nVideo Review:\nI watched video on 3/16/24 during their evening shower time. Staff\n2 is sitting in a chair in the hallway directly across the bathroom.\nAll other youth are sitting in the hallway quietly waiting for their\nturn.\nObservation:\nI observed the bathroom. There are four showers lined up one\nafter another. The two middle showers are used for storage of\nitems and not used. No youth can climb over or under or leave\ntheir shower without staff visibly seeing them.\nDocument Review:\nI reviewed the Shower Expectations:\n…staff stands in between the bathroom…5 minute timed\nshower…\nAnalysis Youth A reported he didn’t see anyone, but “freaked out” when he\nheard a noise. All reported staff sit in the chair in the bathroom\nand one in the hallway. Video, direct observation, and interviews\nconfirm that no one could look at another youth in the shower\nwithout staff noticing. The Shower Expectations were followed.\nStaff completed more than what was expected for staffing the\nshowers by having an additional staff sit in the hallway looking\ndirectly into the bathroom.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be continued.\n4/30/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
