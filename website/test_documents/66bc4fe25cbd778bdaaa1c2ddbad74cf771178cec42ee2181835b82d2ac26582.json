EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nMaltreatment in Care\n6",
    "There were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during the licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the CAP is as follows:\nThe agency renewal inspection was completed on 1/17/24 with a CAP approved\non 2/13/24. The agency was cited for seven violations, four of which were\nrepeated this year. In the 2023 interim review, six violations were found. Four of\nwhich were repeated this year. This 2025 report reflects seven repeat violations\nfrom 2023 as rule 511 (1) was separated out this year, whereas it was combined\nin the 2023 report. The agency reported having a difficult year, as in March 2024\nthe independent living program closed. Youth were discharged from the program\nand staff were released from employment. Over several months, the chief\nadministrator was able to secure resources which resulted in the program\nreopening as an independent living program for teen mothers and pregnant teens.\nThe program began accepting youth again in December 2024. Due to the\nuncertainty of the program for most of 2024, the lack of staffing, and the fact the\nagency did not have any cases to service, CAP implementation was difficult. The\nchief administrator is aware that there is work to do, in order to come into\ncompliance with the areas cited in the 2023, 2024 and 2025 reviews. The chief\nadministrator reported they were confident in their ability to achieve compliance\nwith the newly designed program and increased staff.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment dated 2/25/25 was reviewed and discussed on-site. The Chief\nAdministrator (CA) reported when the program was initially closing in March 2024,\ntheir cases transferred to another agency. In addition, some staff moved to the\nother agency as well. Therefore, Our House had to hire several new staff when\nthey determined the program would remain open in December 2024. The CA\nreported it has been challenging to hire and train new staff, while building,\ndeveloping and opening the new program. Therefore, there were some missed\nitems regarding personnel files and performance evaluations. The CA plans to\nhave all performance evaluations completed in May 2025. While it has been\nchallenging, the CA indicated they believe the program is in a stable place, where\nleadership feels more confident and able to handle all tasks required of them.\nFinancial Overview\nAs the agency was no providing services for most of 2024 and recently started\nservices, a financial audit has not yet been completed for 2024. A financial audit\nwas not completed in 2023. The agency’s 2024 and 2025 budgets were reviewed.\nWhile the agency struggled financially at the beginning of 2024, the restructuring\nof the program and additional resources are expected to improve financial stability.\nStaff Interviews\n7",
    "One staff was interviewed on-site. Staff reported being new to the agency and\ngetting acclimated to the program and the new case they have been assigned.\nStaff stated everything was going very well thus far. Staff stated the agency is a\nvery supportive and positive environment. The chief administrator is their\nsupervisor and has a wealth of knowledge and resources. There were no\nconcerns reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency remains in the same location as previous years. The building has\nadequate office space for staff and meeting space for IL youth. All case files were\nstored securely, and the agency maintains a cross shredder for disposal of\nconfidential information.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis agency is not contracted with MDHHS to provide foster care placement or\ncertification services; therefore, this is not applicable.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n_____________March 12, 2025________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 13, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
