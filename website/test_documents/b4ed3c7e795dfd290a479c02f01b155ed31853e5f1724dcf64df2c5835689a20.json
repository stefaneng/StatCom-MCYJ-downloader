Complainant indicated the\ncourt ordered the ISP be filed within 30 days. Complainant stated\nChild A was placed in care on 2/20/24.\nDCWL Area Manager was contacted on 4/4/24 via TEAMS. It\nwas determined the investigation would focus on ISP timeliness,\nas court orders are not regulated by DCWL, and timeliness of\nproviding an ISP to parents is not addressed in licensing rules.\nChief Administrator was contacted on 4/4/24 via email. Chief\nAdministrator(CA) was informed of the allegation and offered a\nphone call to discuss further. CA emailed a response on 4/5/24. A\nfollow-up email was sent to CA on 4/11/24 regarding the findings\nof the investigation.\nDocuments reviewed\nChild A’s case record was reviewed in MiSACWIS. Per a court\norder dated 2/23/24, Child A entered care on 2/23/24. Therefore,\nan ISP would have been due by 3/24/24. An ISP was located in\nthe file, dated 3/22/24. The timestamp in MiSACWIS verified the\nreport was completed and routed for approval on 3/22/24.\nAnalysis Based on a review of documents in the foster care file, the initial\nservice plan was completed within the required timeframe.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n2",
