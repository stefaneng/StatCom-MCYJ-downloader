    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family\nDescription time for each child in foster care consistent with the child's\nservice plans, as required by R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420 to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Care Worker 1 was court ordered to have video visits with\nDad while he was in jail and did not follow through. Other\nparenting visits were cancelled and not made up/rescheduled.\nInvestigation Document Review:\nA review of the social work contact information in MiSACWIS\nindicated the virtual parenting visits with Youth A and her father\nwere not able to be completed due to technical difficulties\nassociated with the system utilized by the jail. The record\nindicated the foster care worker did make reasonable efforts for\nthe visits to occur, but the father was released before the problem\nwas resolved.\nThe social work contacts further indicated ongoing contact on the\npart of the foster care worker with the father to eventually\nestablish an acceptable plan to accommodate him. The fathers\nparenting visitation plan developed was for 1 time a week for 2\nhours instead of 2 times a week for 1 hour each.\nThe social work contacts indicated there were times when the\nnormally scheduled parenting visits with Youth A and her mother\nwere not able to be completed for varying reasons. The\ndocumentation indicated the time was subsequently allowed to be\nmade up in future scheduled visits. The record indicated the\nmother of Youth A requested having parenting visits once a week\nfor 2 hours instead of twice a week for 1 hour each. This\nrequested schedule was subsequently implemented.\nInterviews:\nThe Complainant 1 was contacted by telephone on 2/1/2024 for\nany additional information. A message was left for the foster\nparent to contact this consultant with any collaborative\ninformation. The foster parent did not provide any additional\ninformation.\nI interviewed the Foster Care Supervisor 1 by telephone on\n4/17/2024. Foster Care Supervisor 1 stated documentation of the\nfoster home visits were in the information system for review.\n2",
    "Foster Care Supervisor 1 stated she reviews case information with\nthe workers on at least a weekly basis and would be aware if a\nworker had not completed the required monthly foster home visits.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 stated she completed the December\n2023 foster home visit with the new case manager as a\nsupervision and training opportunity for the new foster care\nworker. The description of the circumstances reported by Foster\nCare Supervisor 1 was consistent with the social work contact\nentries in the foster child case record.\nStaff 1 was the foster care worker during the time associated with\nthis investigation. Staff 1 was interviewed by telephone on\n5/1/2024. Staff 1 confirmed there was a problem with parenting\ntime during Parent 1’s incarceration.\nI interviewed Foster Mom 1 by telephone on 4/24/2024. Foster\nMom 1 stated things were currently progressing and at a court\nhearing on 4/24/2024 the parents were granted unsupervised\nvisitation. Foster Mom 1 stated she thought things improved when\na new case worker was assigned in December 2023.\nI interviewed Parent 1 by telephone on 5/1/2024. Parent 1\nconfirmed he was not able to have parenting time during his\ntemporary incarceration due to problems with the system used by\nthe jail. Parent 1 reported he has been satisfied with parenting\ntime being provided since his release. Parent 1 stated he has\nrecently been authorized by the court to have unsupervised\nparenting time.\nAnalysis The findings of this investigation determined the foster care\nworker was able to develop a parent visitation plan cooperatively\nwith the parents of Youth A that was acceptable for them. Social\nwork contacts documented in the case record demonstrated\nattempts by the foster care worker to complete video parenting\ncontacts with the father while he was temporarily incarcerated.\nTechnical issues associated with the system outside the foster\ncare workers control were not resolved before the father was\nreleased.\nReasonable efforts were made to provide parenting time for\nParent 1 as determined/confirmed during the interview with Parent\n1. Parent 1 confirmed satisfaction with the scheduling of parenting\ntime for Parent 1.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",

Youth A\nhas a current physical dated 11/21/2023 and a current dental\ndated 1/16/2024. Both medical/dental services were completed\nwithin the time frame required by licensing rules.\nAnalysis The findings of this investigation determined Youth A does have\ncurrent physical and dental examinations that were completed\nwithin the time frame required for compliance with licensing rules.\nThe licensing rules for Child Placing Agencies do not dictate that\nthe agency needs to provide transportation to these appointments\njust that they are completed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Development of service plans\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418\nSection (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents\nDescription and the foster parents in the development of service plans\nto enable the parent or parents and foster parents to\nunderstand the plan for the child and the parents' and the\nfoster parent's role in assisting the agency in carrying out\nthe plan.
