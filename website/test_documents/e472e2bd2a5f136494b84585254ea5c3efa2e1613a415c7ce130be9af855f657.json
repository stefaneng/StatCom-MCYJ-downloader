Youth A was\nmoved from Pod H to Pod C in August due to being assaultive with\nother youths and staff. She said Youth A has never reported staff\nprovided him Percocet.

Clinical\nCase Manager reported Youth A had a psychiatric evaluation on\n05/19/2023 and was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder Adolescent\nOnset, ADHD, and Marijuana Abuse. Youth A’s father refused to sign\nthe psychiatric medication consent form, so when Youth A turned 18\nlast month, he signed the consent form and started his medication for\nADHD. She denied having any knowledge of staff providing Youth A\nwith Percocet. She said only supervisors dispense medication and\nthere is no record of Youth A being prescribe Percocet.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite on 11/02/2023. Youth A is 18 years old\nand has been at the facility for 6 months. He is currently on Pod C,\nbut was previously on Pod H. He was moved to Pod C in September.\nHe reported when he was on Pod C Staff 1 gave him Percocet.\nYouth A could not recall the specific date or time when staff provided\nhim with Percocet, but said it happened sometime in August. He said\nStaff 1 also wrote him love letters and would put the letters under his\nbedroom door. When asked about the letters, Youth A reported he\ngave the letters back to Staff 1. Youth A said he started taking\nAdderall last month because his father had refused to sign the\nconsent form, so when he turned 18 he signed the consent form\nhimself. He has been getting his medication daily and the supervisor\ndispenses his medication.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite on 11/02/2023. Youth B has been at the\nfacility for four months and is placed on Pod H. He said Youth A was\nplaced on Pod H but was moved in September to another Pod.

She adamantly denied providing Youth A with\ndrugs or writing him love letters. She was very surprised by the\nallegations.

Supervisor has been\nworking at the facility for 23 years. Supervisor said he heard that\nYouth A said in court that staff gave him Percocet. Supervisor\nreported he has no reports and has never witnessed or heard that\nstaff provide Youth A or any other youths with Percocet. Supervisor\nreported he meets with staff every day before their shift starts and\nreviews the previous shifts notes with staff, so staff are aware if\nanything is going on with the youths. He has no reports or concerns\nregarding Staff 1. He said Youth A has been very assaultive with\nStaff and other youths and therefore he was moved in September to\na Pod C due to his behavior.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth A’s treatment admission form dated 05/10/2023.\nReason for placement was carrying a concealed weapon.\n3",
