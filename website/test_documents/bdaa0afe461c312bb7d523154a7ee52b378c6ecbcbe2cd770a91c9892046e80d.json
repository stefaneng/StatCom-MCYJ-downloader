    "I interviewed Administrator 1 by phone on 4/28/21. He reported being aware of\nthe allegations and that the facility “screwed up” by not following their\npolicy/procedures after speaking with Staff 1. He also reported he will provide a copy\nof the facility policy/procedures on this issue.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the document tilted “Wedgwood Christian Services Consent for Covid-19\nVaccine”. This document had Youth A’s name and birth date identified and it is\nsigned by his Foster Care Worker on 4/14/21. The do not consent to having this\nvaccine administered is checked.\nI reviewed the document titled “Medical Consent Agreement”. This document states,\n“I understand Wedgwood will attempt to inform me prior to providing any and all\nsuch services unless it is an emergency.”\nI reviewed the document titled “FC-PMOU procedure for DHHS clients”. This\ndocument states, “we may start the medication the same day we obtain the\nwitnessed verbal consent.”\nI reviewed the stream of emails between the Foster Care Worker and the facility in\nregards to the vaccine. The facility sent the consent form to the Foster Care Worker\non 4/10/21 asking her to sign the form for Youth A. The Foster Care Worker returned\nthe signed form on 4/14/21 and stated within the email “Here you are. Youth A’s\nmother does not want him to get the vaccine hence the checked box. On 4/27/21 the\nfacility sent the Foster Care Worker an email stating, “Youth A was given his\n1st Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine today – 4/27/21. Please see enclosed Vaccine Fact\nSheet.” The Foster Care Worker replied on 4/27/21 with the following, “Youth A was\nnot supposed to receive the vaccine. While I was told I had to sign the consent form,\nI spoke with his mother prior and she did not want him to receive it, which I noted. I\nhave attached the form that I previously sent in.” The facility responded on 4/28/21\n“I am forwarding your email to the nurse who received this from you. I will have her\nget back to you.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\n(e) Dispensing medication.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
