TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n During this inspection, it was discovered that the coding of social work\ncontacts was not consistent and often items were coded in different ways\nwithin the same case file. This was discussed at the exit meeting and the\nagency agreed that they will examine this in detail and develop a system of\nquality assurance to ensure that compliance is being met.\n During the review of the special evaluations completed by the agency, it was\ndiscovered that the primary process of the corrective action plan was present,\nbut their development of monitoring compliance was scheduled to only occur\nduring an annual inspection. We discussed the importance of ongoing\nmonitoring that would occur more often. The agency agreed with the need to\nmake this change to ensure that compliance is being met.\nV.
