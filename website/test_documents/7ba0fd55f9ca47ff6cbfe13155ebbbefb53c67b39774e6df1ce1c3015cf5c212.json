When asked to explain more\nshe reported that she gets to go out on a lot of outings and\ngets to go to school off grounds. She confirmed it is an\nopen facility. She reported that the staff are really nice\nthere. I asked about the AWOL incident from 2/13. She\nreported that staff were watching her but when they turned\ntheir head, she left the building. She could not remember\nwhat staff was working. She reported that staff watched\nher but once she hit the driveway, they cannot see her.\nShe reported staff will not restrain a youth if they run away.\nShe reported staff only restrain if the youth is a harm to\nthemselves or others. [Youth D] reported that staff\nsupervise really well but they can’t chase a kid when they\nrun because they have to stay in ratio. I asked about [Staff\n1] and she reported that she is a really nice staff and does\na great job with the youth. Noted no concerns with\nsupervision. [Youth D] wants to go back to New Hope and\nhas a plan to not awol any longer.”\n• Incident Report dated 2/13/2025 for Youth D. Incident\nreport consistent with staff and youth interviews.

    "report documented date/time worker, Law enforcement,\nparent/guardian, and DCWL was notified of AWOL.\n• Email from Foster Care Worker dated 2/19/2025 regarding\nYouth D’s placement at the facility. “[Youth D] has\nstruggled significantly while at New Hope. They have been\nvery proactive in their communication with me regarding\nher struggles as well as involved in planning and trying to\nfind a way to keep [Youth D] safe from her own decisions. I\nwould never expect them to jeopardize their staffing ratio in\nthe home when [Youth D] is choosing to leave. They are\nalso limited in what they are able to do to prevent her from\nleaving in the first place.”\n• New Hope Youth Center Youth Supervision, Movement\nand Checks Policy. Policy states, “Staff shall ensure that\nappropriate supervision of the youth is maintained at all\ntimes. Staff shall provide effective positioning for optimal\nsight and sound supervision of youth.
