The hallway is narrow. Standing in\nthe middle of the hallway with one’s arms stretched out to each\nside, it would be possible to touch the hallway walls.\nAnother Department of Health and Human Service agency\ncompleted an investigation without findings.\nAnalysis Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, and Staff Person 1 restrained Youth A\non 09/03/2023. Youth A went to Hurley Hospital on his own accord\nfollowing his restraint. Hurley Hospital documented Youth A with\nbruising on the top of his right wrist, right shoulder and arm, and\nleft chest. Youth A’s skin injuries were determined to not require\nimaging or treatment. I interviewed Youth A on 09/07/2023 and\nobserved him without marks. Youth A stated the bruises faded\naway and stated he was not in pain. Restraints are to be done free\nof marks, injury, and pain, however, video review supports the\ninterviews that Youth A moved around and resisted the restraint. It\nis found Youth A’s movement in the restraint contributed to his\nbruising, which did not need medical attention. It is not found that\nstaff physically punished Youth A.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nR 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\n(1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention: (iv) Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nVideo review showed Supervisor 2 excitedly talking to Youth A in\nthe hallway. Video does not include sound and Youth A did not\nallege that Supervisor 2 yelled or threatened him. Best practice is\nfor staff to respond in a calm, firm manner in escalating situations.\n7",
