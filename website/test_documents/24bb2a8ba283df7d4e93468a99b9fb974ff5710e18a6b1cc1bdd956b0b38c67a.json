Signatures from all\nappropriate case members, including youth ages 14 and older for\nfoster care and youth ages 11 and older for juvenile justice, should\nbe obtained before the corresponding court hearing. All treatment\nplans with a report date of August 1, 2017, or later must have\nsignatures from all appropriate case members within 30 days of\nthe report date.\nSeven of twenty-five treatment plans had late or missing signatures.\nFile one: 4/3/20 PATP was not signed by the parent until 7/13/20.\nFile two: 6/24/20 PATP was missing the caregiver signature.\nFile three: 10/10/19 PATP was not signed by the foster parent until 11/21/19.\nFile four: 10/25/19 PATP signed by parents and caregiver 12/18/19. 1/23/20 PATP\nprovided late via mail on 5/7/20, no signatures. 4/22/20 PATP mailed 5/8/20, no\nsignatures. 7/21/20 PATP mailed on 8/5/20; no signatures.\nREPEAT VIOLATION\nRenewal dated 7/16/19, CAP approved 7/29/19.\nFOM 722-09 Updated service plan\nSupervisory approval- prior to finalizing, the USP along with the\nrequired assessments (FANS, CANS, etc.) must be reviewed and\napproved by the foster care supervisor only after a face-to-face\nmeeting with the worker. Case service plan approval process\nrequires the foster care supervisor to review and approve the USP\nwithin 14 calendar days of the report date.\nFour of twenty-five service plans were not approved by the supervisor within the 14\nday requirement.\nFile one: USP completed 7/15/20, approved by the supervisor 8/10/20.\nFile two: USP completed 7/3/20, approved by the supervisor 7/23/20.\nFile three: USP completed 11/11/19, approved by the supervisor 12/6/19.\nFile four: USP completed 7/21/20, approved by the supervisor 8/5/20.\nREPEAT VIOLATION\nRenewal dated 7/16/19, CAP approved 7/29/19.\nInterim dated 7/23/18, CAP approved 8/6/18.\nFOM 722-06b Family team meeting\nFTMs should include child welfare staff, parents, caretakers, foster\nparents, children, youth, and may also include extended family,\nfriends, neighbors, community-based service providers, community\n5",
    "representatives, tribal representatives, for Indian children, or other\nprofessionals involved with the family.\nOne of nine foster care and IL case files did not meet this requirement. The file was\nmissing one FTM prior to the July 2020 USP. The file was also missing the 1105\nreport for the April 2020 FTM.\nREPEAT VIOLATION\nRenewal dated 7/16/19, CAP approved 7/29/19.\nInterim dated 7/23/18, CAP approved 8/6/18.\nIV. ANALYST INFORMATION\nThere were no safety alerts for this agency.\nV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nRule 327 (1c) Special Evaluations. TA was provided to the facility regarding an SE\nthat was completed in which it was alleged the foster parents accepted an IL\nplacement from another agency. The interviews with the foster parents, and the\ncurrent and former children placed in the home concluded that the alleged IL youth\nnever lived in the home. However, the IL youth’s caseworker from another agency\nindicated that she had visit the youth at their home. The IL youth was not\ninterviewed. When asked why the IL youth was not interviewed, the agency\nindicated that the IL caseworker did not have any documentation or other\ninformation to confirm her visits with the IL youth at the foster home. Due to the\nfoster parents and other household members denying the placement, the agency felt\nthe information was sufficient to conclude the investigation. The agency was advised\nthat an interview with the IL youth should have been attempted to fully complete the\ninvestigation.\nVI. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nFOM 801 Medical Passports. The facility completed quarterly passports on a\nquarterly, calendar schedule (Q1- Jan to March, Q2- April to June, Q3- July to Sept,\nQ4- Oct to Dec). Policy was reviewed as there was a question about what “quarterly”\nmeant: a quarterly calendar, or every 90 days. The policy office was contact and\nstated there is not a definition for quarterly. However, best practice would be for the\nupdated passports to align with the 90 day service plans. The agency was advised\nof this clarification from the policy office.\nVII. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\n6",
    "The agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\n Interim review dated 7/23/18, CAP approved 8/6/18 and renewal report dated\n7/16/19, CAP approved 7/29/19. The 2018 evaluation found 15 violations and\nthe 2019 evaluation found 14 violations. During this review only 5 violations\nwere found, including 3 repeat violations. While there were repeats, the\noccurrence of each repeat was low and some timeliness issues could be\nattributed to the challenges of completing tasks during the COVID-19\npandemic. Overall, it appears the agency CAPs have been effective in\nreducing the number of violations.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract. Upon receipt of an acceptable\ncorrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a regular license.\nSeptember 28, 2020\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 7, 2020\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
