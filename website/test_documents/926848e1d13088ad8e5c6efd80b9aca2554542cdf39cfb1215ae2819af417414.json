The rental agreement is\nopen-ended with a clause that either party will need to provide 6 months’ notice to\nterminate the agreement. A walk-through of both houses occurred on 4/14/25.\nBoth homes were in excellent condition with appropriate furniture. Both homes\nhad adequate space, including the living room, dining area, kitchen, laundry, and\nstorage areas. One home is currently used to house six female IL youth. The\nother home will be used to house four male IL youth.\nThe agency’s office is in the house located at 406 S. Blackstone. The office has\nlocking doors, locking file cabinets, and sufficient space for staff to work and meet\nwith youth or agency partners.\nB. Program Description\nThe My Place program is designed for Independent Living eligible DHHS youth\nages 16- 21. The program will provide safe, stable housing, and supportive\nservices. The agency will provide housing, community support services, and case\nmanagement services for youth in foster care or Young Adult Voluntary Foster\nCare (YAVFC) through MDHHS. Youth must meet eligibility criteria for the IL\nprogram as outlined in the agency’s Program Statement and agree to follow\nagency policies and procedures.\nAs My Place will not be staffed twenty-four hours a day, the agency expects youth\nto be able to care for themselves independently and safely. Youth must be able to\nuse public transportation, be home alone, safely use a stove/oven/microwave,\ncomplete chores, practice personal hygiene, engage in school, work or other\ncommunity services. Youth must be working or engaging in school with progress\ntoward a high school diploma or Graduate Equivalency Degree (GED).

Youth must not be actively battling a substance use\ndisorder and must have a minimum of three months sobriety following substance\nuse disorder.

The\nagency will operate with a Chief Administrator/Supervisor and one Case Manager\ninitially. Additional support staff will be hired as needed, based on the number of\nyouth served. The CA/Supervisor and Case Manager have registered to complete\nCWTI training. The agency is aware of the caseload size restrictions in place\nwhile completing CWTI training.\nFinancially, the program is currently funded through donations, grants, and\ncommunity partnerships. With the licensed IL program, the agency will also\n3",
    "receive the MDHHS Administrative Rate. While My Place will not rely on the\nMDHHS administrative rate, this income will be added to the projected budget\nonce the license is approved. The projected budget for 2025 was reviewed; no\nconcerns were noted.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe agency is in compliance with all licensing rules and statues.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on substantial compliance with the rules, it is recommended that a six-month\noriginal license be issued.\n___________July 11, 2025_____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 11, 2025\n________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
