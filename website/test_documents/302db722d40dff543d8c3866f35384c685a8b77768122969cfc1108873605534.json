The agency had\nfoster care responsibility and was required to provide supervision and monitoring of\nthe case, including notification of the death.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis incident was reported directly by the agency Chief Administrator on 03/04/21.\nMDHHS was also contacted, and this was logged under ID 82776012, but not\nassigned for investigation.\nI interviewed the Chief Administrator on 03/04/21, via phone, when she called to\nadvise that Child A, who was almost 8 months old, had died while in an unlicensed\nrelative placement. It was reported that the relative brought Child A to the relative’s\n3",
    "mother’s home. Child A fell asleep and when checked on, and was not responsive.\nThe Chief Administrator reported that the agency had case responsibility since\nJanuary 2021 but was in process of transferring it back to MDHHS when the child\ndied. It was reported that MDHHS was completing most of the documentation but\nwas working with their agency for historical details. The Chief Administrator reported\nthat Child A passed away on 03/03/21 and noted that she was notified about 4:30-\n5:00pm that evening. In subsequent email contacts with the Chief Administrator, she\nprovided the contact information for the Foster Care Worker (FCW) and Foster Care\nSupervisor (FC Supervisor). The Chief Administrator also clarified via email, on\n03/24/21, that the case had transferred back to MDHHS earlier in the day on\n03/03/21, prior to the child passing and therefore, had done much of the reporting.\nThe Chief Administrator said that her understanding was that the report of death to\nMDHHS was made about 2:50pm. She did not initially report the death to DCWL\nbecause the case had already transferred back to MDHHS earlier that day and they\nno longer had responsibility. The Chief Administrator said that the following day she\nthought she should contact me to let me know regardless.\nI completed a phone interview the Foster Care Supervisor (FC Supervisor) on\n03/19/21. The FC Supervisor reviewed the case and reported no concerns with the\nrelative caregiver or her mother. The agency was aware that the relative’s mother\nwas providing substitute care. The FC Supervisor said that DHHS had not picked up\nthe case for investigation. The child had no known medical issues per the FC\nSupervisor, who also reported that the Foster Care Worker had discussed the child’s\nhealth history with the mother and nothing of concern was reported by her. The FC\nSupervisor said that the child received a timely medical and it was uploaded to\nMiSACWIS. The medical exam noted no issues and the physician met with the\nrelative caregiver. The FC Supervisor was asked about some of the casework\nobserved to be late in MiSACWIS, and he reported that some, notably the Initial\nRelative Home Study, was late due to the Foster Care Worker being new. The FC\nSupervisor said that there was some initial confusion on who was going to complete\nit, and he ended up directing the Foster Care Worker to do so.\nI interviewed the Foster Care Worker (FCW) via phone on 03/24/21. The FCW said\nthat she is a new worker with six months experience. The FCW reviewed the case\nand reported that she was assigned the case 12/30/20. The FCW reported that she\nwas in the home often due to visits and had no concerns with the care provided by\nthe relative. The FCW also said that she had met the relative’s mother and did not\nhave concerns with her. The FCW said that the relative and the relative’s mother\nhad clearances completed. The FCW reported that she was not aware of any\nmedical issues that the child had and noted that he had a well child exam completed\ntimely. The FCW further reported that she spoke with the mother and asked about\nany medical concerns, to which the mother reported none outside of the child having\ntested positive at birth for substances. The FCW acknowledged that some case work\nwas completed late. She reported that initially there was confusion as to whether she\nor the licensing worker were going to complete the Relative Home Study 3130A. The\nFCW was ultimately directed to complete it and it was late.\n4",
    "Documentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows with applicable\ninformation noted:\n Agency case assignment was verified in MiSACWIS.\n MiSACWIS verification of DHHS intake time was observed to be 3/03/21 at\n3:13pm.\n Well Child Exam for Child A, dated 01/26/21.\n MiSACWIS placement information for Child A reviewed. Placed in the relative\nhome 12/30/20. No Placement Exception for over five children in the home.\n MiSACWIS social work contacts for visits with the child were reviewed.\n Initial Placement Outline, completed by Worker 2 and approved by Supervisor\n2, dated 01/28/21. Most prompts completed as ‘unknown.’\n Initial Service Plan, completed 02/04/21, signed 03/04/21 by the FCW and the\nFC Supervisor.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12415 Incident reporting policy.\n(2) The policy shall require that the agency immediately notifies\nall of the following entities of the death of a foster child:\n(a) The child's parents.\n(b) The referring agency.\n(c) The department licensing authority.\n(d) The lawyer guardian ad litem and court, as applicable.\nANALYSIS: The agency is compliant with the rule as the case had already\nbeen transferred back to MDHHS at the time of the child’s\npassing and they were no longer responsible to make the\nrequired notifications. The agency worked with the local DHHS\noffice who had accepted the case back after the incident.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe agency did not document having provided the relative caregiver with the\nrequired foster parent information timely. The documentation in the file was not\ncomplete.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, a cursory review of case information was\ncompleted inclusive of required information being provided to the caregiver.

The information was dated 01/28/21,\nwhich was almost one month after the child was placed in the home. The place for\ndocumentation that the information was provided to the caregiver was left blank.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12417 Foster parent information.\n(1) An agency shall provide a foster parent with all of the\nfollowing information before the placement or replacement of a\nchild:\n(c) Available known information about the child’s health.\n(d) Any known history of abuse or neglect of the child.\n(e) All known emotional and psychological factors relating to\nthe care of the child.\n(f) All known behavioral problems of the child.\n(g) Circumstances necessitating placement or replacement\nof the child.\n(h) Any other known information to enable the foster parent\nto provide a stable, safe, and healthy environment for the\nfoster child and the foster family, including information\nabout siblings who do not reside in the foster home.\n(i) Name of assigned social service worker.\n(2) For an emergency placement, if any of the information\nspecified in subrule (1)(a) to (h) of this rule is not available at the\ntime of placement, then the agency shall provide information to\nthe foster parent within 7 calendar days of the placement.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation of the rule as the required information\nwas not provided to the relative foster parent at the time of\nplacement or within the seven calendar days after.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe Initial Service Plan was completed and approved late.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, a cursory review of case information was\ncompleted inclusive of the Initial Service Plan. The Initial Service Plan was observed\nto cover the period 12/30/20 through 01/28/21 and was completed by the FCW on\n02/04/21. The plan was reviewed by the FC Supervisor and returned to the FCW for\n6",
    "corrections on 02/11/21. The FCW resubmitted the revised plan to the FC\nSupervisor on 02/28/21, and the FC Supervisor approved the plan in MiSACWIS on\n03/04/21.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each child\nand parent or parents, as follows:\n(a) Within 30 calendar days from removal from the home.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation as the Initial Service Plan was\ncompleted late.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe agency completed the 3130 A about one month late.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, a cursory review of case information was\ncompleted inclusive of the Initial Relative Home Study. The agency was assigned\nthe case 12/30/20 and did not complete the study until 02/24/21.\nAPPLICABLE POLICY\nFOM 722-03B RELATIVE ENGAGEMENT AND PLACEMENT\nThe DHS-3130A, Relative Placement Home Study, is a\ncomprehensive home assessment that considers multiple\ndomains in a prospective caregiver's life. The Relative\nPlacement Home Study allows caseworkers to identify strengths\nand barriers that may impact a child's placement. The Relative\nPlacement Home Study must be completed within the\ntimeframes described below:\n For emergency placements, within 30 calendar days of\nthe child’s placement in the relative home.\n For planned placement changes, prior to placement in\nthe relative home, but within 30 calendar days of the\nwritten request.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency is in violation as the Initial Relative Home Study\nwas completed almost one month late.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe agency did not complete the required Placement Exception request.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, a cursory review of case information was\ncompleted inclusive of placement information. The relative caregiver was noted to\nhave four children of her own when she took placement of Child A and his sister. A\nPlacement Exception Request was not completed as required for more than five\nchildren in the home.\nAPPLICABLE POLICY\nFOM 722-03E PLACEMENT EXCEPTION REQUESTS AND APPROVALS\nCaseworkers must complete a placement exception request\n(PER) when there is a need to waive placement standards to\nmaintain sibling and caregiver bonds or to meet the medical,\nemotional, and psychological needs of children in care.

    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the agency submitting an\nacceptable and timely corrective action plan.\nApril 20, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 26, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n9"
