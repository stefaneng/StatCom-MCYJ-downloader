    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection • (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family\nDescription time for each child in foster care consistent with the child's\nservice plans, as required by R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420 to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster care worker (FCW1) was aware a respondent parent was\nhaving contact with their child who is in care while in a relative\nplacement and did not take action for months.\nInvestigation Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via telephone on\nMarch 5, 2024. She stated FCW1 is no longer with the agency but\ndoes not have any reason to believe he was aware Complainant\nwas allowing unsupervised visits to occur between Youth A and\nhis biological mother.\nShe stated the Complainant filed an appeal with the Foster Care\nReview Board (FCRB) and the hearing was today. A forwarded\nemail from FCRB was received from CA later in the day\ndocumenting FCRB agreed with the agency’s decision to move\nYouth A from Complainant’s home. She believes the allegations\nare due to Complainant being upset about the agency’s decision\nto move Youth A from her home.\nFoster care worker 2 (FCW2) was interviewed via telephone\non March 8, 2024. She stated she was recently promoted to a\nsupervisor position but her role in this case was as a lead foster\ncare worker when FCW1 left the agency at the end of November\n2023. She has assisted on and off since that time.\nFCW2 stated she wanted to change the location of parenting time\nvisits from Complainant’s house back to the office on a temporary\nbasis due to her being unfamiliar with the case and since it was\ngoing to termination, she wanted to see how the visits were going.\nIn addition, Complainant has previously expressed safety\nconcerns regarding Youth A’s biological mother. Biological mother\nwas notified visits would be temporarily moving to the agency\noffice, and she stated she did not agree with the decision and had\nalready been having unsupervised visits with Youth A for over a\n2",
    "year. Biological mother proceeded to provide FCW2 with\nscreenshots of text messages between Complainant and Youth\nA’s biological mother. The text messages appear to show\nComplainant coordinating unsupervised visits with Youth A’s\nbiological mother on several occasions. FCW2 contacted\nComplainant and inquired about whether or not unsupervised\nvisits were occurring to which Complainant denied this was\nhappening. FCW2 conducted a home visit on February 15, 2024,\nand again inquired about unsupervised visits. Complainant again\ndenied this was occurring but when FCW2 advised she had text\nmessages that indicated otherwise, Complainant then admitted it\nwas true and this had been occurring as early as October 2023,\nbut potentially earlier. Complainant also stated to FCW2 that\nFCW1 was aware she was allowing unsupervised contact\nbetween Youth A and biological mother to occur. FCW2 indicated\nshe is not sure whether or not this is accurate based on\nComplainant’s history of not being forthcoming.\nFoster care worker 1 (FCW1) was interviewed via telephone\non March 11, 2024. He stated he was the assigned caseworker\nfor Youth A’s case from the time of removal until the end of\nNovember 2023. During his time as Youth A’s caseworker, he had\nno knowledge or suspicion Complainant was allowing\nunsupervised visits to occur between Youth A and his biological\nmother. He stated Complainant was a designee and was allowed\nto supervise the visits between Youth A and his biological mother.\nWhen visits occurred Complainant would send him a text\nmessage 1-2 times per week to notify him that a visit occurred and\nprovided a brief summary to let him know if there were any\nconcerns.\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on March 11,\n2024. She stated Youth A was placed with her for a year and a\nhalf from the time he was removed from his biological mother until\nthe end of February. She stated she allowed unsupervised contact\nto occur between Youth A and his biological mother beginning\napproximately October 2023 until February 2024. She did not\nnotify FCW1 that this occurred, and she does not believe he knew\nit was occurring.\nFoster Care supervisor (FC Supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on March 14, 2024. She stated she had previously\nworked at the agency, left and came back. When she came back,\nshe became the supervisor. She was not signing off on reports but\ndid a lot of the job functions as far as oversight with staff, including\nFCW1. FC Supervisor stated it was made clear to Complainant\n3",
    "that all visits needed to be supervised. A DHS investigation was\nopened at one point and during that time parenting time was\nsupervised at the agency. She stated she reiterated\nComplainant’s role and responsibility as a designee on numerous\noccasions. She stated there is nothing to suggest FCW1 was\naware Complainant was allowing unsupervised visits to occur.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Court order dated November 7, 2023. Complainant and\nbiological mother present. Order states parenting time is\nsupervised until further notice. Court order dated February\n12, 2024. Complainant and biological mother present.\nOrder states parenting time is supervised until further\nnotice.\n• Parenting time social work contacts were reviewed during\ndate range September 1, 2023-February 29, 2024. 19 total\ncontacts were reviewed. Contacts indicated parenting time\noccurred as a designee visit/supervision. There were no\ncontacts entered for November 2023.\n• Placement record: Youth A was placed in Complainant’s\nhome from November 10, 2022-February 26, 2024.\n• November 27, 2023, USP visitation plan: twice per week\nsupervised visits. Parenting time supervised by designee\noccurs at relative’s home or parental home. February 25,\n2024, USP visitation plan: parenting times are court\nordered to be supervised. Parenting time can occur when\nsupervised by the agency or designee.\nAnalysis After conducting interviews and reviewing Youth A’s MISACWIS\ncase file the agency is found in compliance as there is no\nevidence to support the allegations. Complainant and FCW1 both\nstated during their interviews that FCW1 was not aware\nComplainant was allowing unsupervised contact to occur.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection • (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nDescription suitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\n4",

In addition, Complainant has previously\nexpressed safety concerns regarding Youth A’s biological mother.\nUpon notifying biological mother that visits would be temporarily\nmoving to the agency office she notified FCW2 she did not agree\nand had already been having unsupervised visits with Youth A for\nover a year. Biological mother proceeded to provide FCW2 with\nscreenshots of text messages between Complainant and Youth\nA’s biological mother. The text messages appear to show\nComplainant was coordinating unsupervised visits with Youth A’s\nbiological mother on several occasions. FCW2 contacted\nComplainant and inquired about whether or not unsupervised\nvisits were occurring to which Complainant denied that was\nhappening. FCW2 conducted a home visit on February 15, 2024,\nand again inquired about unsupervised visits.

When asked\nfor examples, she stated FCW2 referenced a text message she\nhad received regarding unsupervised contact but did not provide\nthe messages. On another occasion she conducted an\nunannounced home visit.
