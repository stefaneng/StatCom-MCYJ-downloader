    "Allegation On 9/3/23, Staff 1 was verbally abusive and using profanity toward\nyouth. Staff 1’s body language was also threatening and was\nposturing toward the youth. It is unknown at this time if Staff 1\nmade threats toward the youth.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face\nto face at the facility on 9/7/23. CA reported the incident\noccurred on 9/3/23 and Supervisor called her about 20 minutes\nafter it occurred. CA reported she watched the video and viewed\nSupervisor telling Staff 1 multiple times to stop, leave the area, not\nto open the youth’s door, etc. and he ignored all prompts. CA\nspoke to Staff 1 via phone after watching the video footage and let\nStaff 1 know he would be placed on leave until the investigation\nwas finished. CA reported Staff 1 kept repeating “watch the video,\nwatch the video” during their conversation as if it was going to\nredeem him. CA reported Staff 1’s defense was “how can I be a\nthreat if I didn’t go in the room?”. CA reported Staff 1 does not\nknow how to step back from the situation. CA reported Staff 1\ndisobeyed multiple verbal directives from Supervisor, didn’t follow\nthe facility’s discipline policy and displayed unprofessional\nconduct. CA reported there have been other concerns and\nincidents, which have prompted them to provide Staff 1 with\ncoaching. In addition, CA reported Staff 1 just had anger\nmanagement coaching/counseling (3 sessions) within the last 2\nmonths based on an inappropriate interaction he had with two of\nhis peers. CA reported in April or May 2023, Youth G was in his\nroom, with the door closed and the lights off. CA reported Youth G\nwas mouthing off to Staff 1 and Staff 1 key fobbed the door\nbecause he said he felt intimidated. CA reported Staff 1 entered\nthe room, and a physical management of the youth happens, but it\ncan’t be seen because it occurred in the youth’s room, and it was\ndark. CA reported Staff 1 did not follow protocol because he did\nnot call for back-up and he physically managed a youth who was\nalready confined to his room and did not pose a viable threat.\nAdministrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n9/7/23. Administrator reported Staff 1 has been provided coaching\nfor other incidents of a similar nature involving various youth and\nstaff at the facility. Administrator noted two years ago she was\npresent when Staff 1 became angry a youth wouldn’t give a pencil\nto the teacher, so Staff 1 slammed his hands on the table and\nsaid, “If you wanna go, we will go”. Administrator reported she told\nhim to “tap out”, which means to leave the situation. Administrator\nreported Staff 1 had to be prompted multiple times before he left\nthe room.\n2",
    "Supervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n9/7/23. Supervisor reported on 9/3/23, she was busy with tasks in\nthe lobby when a Code 2 was called for the A-2 pod over the\nradio. Supervisor called Staff 1 and asked him to report since she\nwas busy. Supervisor reported when she was done, she went to\nthe pod. When she entered the side door to the pod, Supervisor\nreported Staff 1 was yelling at Youth B while Youth B was\nquarantined in his room. Supervisor reported she heard Staff 1\nyell things like “Y’all don’t run this facility!” and “I’m gonna fuck\ny’all up!”. Supervisor reported she told Staff 1 to take a break,\nwhich is how they tell staff to leave the area. Staff 1 responded\n“I’m going to have [Youth C] clean up his milk” and began walking\nthe mop bucket over to Youth C’s room. Supervisor reported\nYouth C was why the Code 2 was called, and he was already\nsecured in his room. Supervisor reported she instructed Staff 1 to\nleave the area because Youth C was already secured, and all\nactivities needed to stop. Supervisor reported Staff 1 continued to\ngo to Youth C’s room and key fobbed the door, but Staff 2 was\nable to open the door to the gym and pushed Staff 1 into the gym\nsince he wasn’t listening. Supervisor reported she was trying to\ncalm all the youth in the pod down because there was a lot of\nyelling happening, so she decided to lock down the pod. As she\nwas explaining to all the youth why she was locking down the pod,\nStaff 1 came back into the pod and headed towards Youth B’s\ndoor. Supervisor reported Staff 1 was still screaming and said, “I\njust want to talk to him” (referring to Youth B). Supervisor reported\nshe told Staff 1 to stand down and instructed him not to open\nYouth B’s door multiple times. She turned to walk away, but she\nheard a key fob sound on Youth B’s door, saw Staff 1 opening the\ndoor, and immediately reacted and shut the door. Supervisor\nreported Staff 2 grabbed Staff 1’s arm and took him out of the pod.\nSupervisor reported after she calmed everything down, she\nreported the incident to CA and CA put Staff 1 on leave.\nSupervisor reported Staff 1’s actions caused her to be concerned\nabout Youth B’s safety if Staff 1 would have entered the room.\nSupervisor reported Staff 1 didn’t take responsibility for anything\nafter the incident. Supervisor reported a few months ago, Staff 1\nverbally assaulted her by yelling and cussing at her after she gave\nhim a directive from another supervisor. Supervisor reported he\nwas so aggressive, a cafeteria worker came out of the kitchen and\nsaid “That’s enough. That’s your superior”.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/7/23.\nStaff 1 reported he was second in command during his shift on\n9/3/23, and he was asked by Supervisor to address the Code 2 in\na different pod. Staff 1 reported when he entered the pod, Staff 2\n3",
    "handed him some paper towel and said “can you get [Youth C] to\nclean the milk up in his room because he threw it all over? He’s\nnot listening, and he’s upset, so he won’t clean it up.” Staff 1\nreported he helped because he plays “the fixer” as he’s the only\nmale on shift and he’s been playing that role since working at the\nfacility when the “women staff can’t handle the male kids”. Staff 1\nreported when he went into Youth C’s room to talk to him, Youth C\nstarted cussing at him. Staff 1 reported Youth C wouldn’t clean up\nthe mess with paper towel, so he asked another staff member to\nbring a mop bucket to the pod. Staff 1 reported he went to the\nother door to retrieve the mop bucket, when Youth B began\nbanging on his door and yelling, he wanted to get out of his room.\nStaff 1 reported he said “Y’all really gonna make me work today\nhuh?”. Staff 1 reported Youth B replied “You ain’t gonna work out\nshit over here” and Staff 1 responded “I’ll work out whatever I\nhave to work out”. Staff 1 told Youth B “You don’t get to make the\nrules and run the facility around here”. Staff 1 reported he said\nsome other things too, but he couldn’t remember what because he\nwas trying to regain order in the pod. Staff 1 reported when\nSupervisor arrived in the pod, he left the pod and went into the flex\narea. While in the flex area, Staff 1 reported he heard Supervisor\nyelling “[Youth B] Stop!” so he thought it was a Code 1 situation\nand went back into the pod to help. Staff 1 reported he wanted to\ngo into Youth B’s room to talk to him personally, as he has always\ndone it before, but Supervisor and Staff 2 told him not to open\nYouth B’s door because they didn’t feel he was in the right\nmindset to talk to Youth B. Staff 1 reported he key fobbed Youth\nB’s door and Supervisor came up, shut the door and yelled “no!”.\nStaff 1 reported Staff 2 assisted him in leaving the pod. Staff 1\nstated he left willingly and “submitted to [Staff 2]”. Staff 1 reported\n“if he was in a rage, there is no woman who would have been able\nto stop him”. Staff 1 reported he loves kids, is a coach, and would\nnever hurt any kids. Staff 1 reported shortly later, Supervisor told\nStaff 1 to call CA. Staff 1 reported CA told him she watched the\nvideo footage, didn’t like what she saw in the pod, and told him he\nwould be on leave until the investigation was done. Staff 1\nreported he didn’t say or do anything differently than he has any\nother time, but the difference this time is the pod was locked down\nand under surveillance, so the video cameras were reviewed.\nStaff 1 reiterated multiple times the only reason this investigation\nis occurring is because he was “under a microscope” due to the\npod being locked down. Staff 1 stated “they’re women and I try to\nprotect them when I’m here, that’s what I always do when I’m on\nshift”. Staff 1 also stated “there’s no policy saying we can’t go into\na youth’s room while they’re upset. I’ve always done that”. Staff 1\nreported he doesn’t remember Supervisor saying much to deter\n4",
    "him from talking to Youth B besides “not now”. Staff 1 reported\nwhen Supervisor “tapped him out”, he listened and went willingly.\nStaff 1 stated “Nothing like this has ever happened with a youth or\nadult at the facility. This was an isolated incident.” When asked\nwhat he could have done differently, Staff 1 reported “I could have\ncoached [Staff 2] on what a Code 2 is because it wasn’t called\nright. It caused me to get temperamental because I walked into a\nchaotic situation that wasn’t mine to begin with. I came in behind\nsomething I didn’t create.” He also stated “I need to get better at\nnot taking things personal. I’m a coach and I care, but I need to\nnot personalize it. I need to scale it back”.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 9/13/23. Staff 2 reported\nshe called a Code 2 on the pod and Staff 1 responded because\nSupervisor wasn’t available. Staff 2 reported she called a Code 2\nbecause Youth C was in his room in a “time out”, but he was being\naggressive, kicking the door and making threats about what he\nwould do if he couldn’t leave his room. When Staff 1 entered the\npod, Staff 2 told him what was going on and asked if Staff 1 could\ntalk to Youth C because he threw his lunch and milk all over his\nroom. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 obtained a mop bucket and as he\nwas walking towards Youth C’s door, he was cussing and yelling\nback and forth with Youth B. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 yelled “You\ngoing to be disrespectful to me? Come at me!”. As they were\nyelling, Supervisor entered the pod and Staff 2 explained what\nwas going on. Since no one was listening or following directions,\nSupervisor made the decision to shut down the pod. Staff 1\ncontinued to walk towards Youth C’s room with the mop bucket,\nbut Supervisor told Staff 1 not to enter Youth C’s room. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 didn’t stop, was continuing to yell at Youth B and\nbegan yelling at Youth C. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was being\naggressive, and Supervisor told Staff 1 not to open Youth C’s door\nagain. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 yelled “He’s not going to be\ndisrespectful to me! They ain’t gonna run this place. They ain’t\ngonna run nothin’ but their mouths”. Staff 2 reported Staff 1\nattempted to open Youth C’s door, but Staff 2 opened the gym\ndoor and pushed Staff 1 into the gym, so he couldn’t. Staff 2\nreported Supervisor was trying to get things in order when Staff 1\nre-entered the pod. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 went to Youth B’s door\nand began yelling at him, being very aggressive. Staff 2 stated\nSupervisor told Staff 1 not to open Youth B’s door, and Staff 1\nreplied “He ain’t gonna talk crazy to me”. Staff 2 reported she\ncould not hear everything Staff 1 was saying because Staff 1 was\nyelling. Staff 2 reported she and Supervisor both repeatedly told\nStaff 1 not to go into Youth B’s room or open the door. Staff 2\nreported Supervisor told Staff 1 “You can’t do this. You’re not in\n5",
    "the right state of mind right now. Stop!”. Staff 2 reported Youth B\nwas in his room and was standing in a defensive position like he\nwas prepared to fight with Staff 1 if Staff 1 entered the room. Staff\n1 pushed Supervisor and Staff 2 away from Youth B’s door, key\nfobbed the door and opened it. Staff 2 reported Supervisor\nimmediately shut Youth B’s door and Staff 2 grabbed Staff 1’s arm\nand took him out of the pod. Staff 2 reported this is not the first\ntime he has shown this type of behavior in front of youth or staff,\nbut this has been the worst one. Staff 2 reported a couple months\nago, Staff 1 was aggressive towards her and another female staff.\nStaff 2 reported Staff 1 said “I’m a man, and you are women, so\nyou’re going to respect me” and “You’re not going to disrespect\nme. You’re not going to talk to me like that”. Staff 2 reported a lot\nof things he was saying towards Youth B and Youth C on 9/3/23\nwere the same things he has said to his peers. Staff 2 reported\nshe wants to feel safe at work, but she feels very unsafe around\nStaff 1, who is someone she is supposed to be able to trust, feel\ncomfortable and be professional around. Staff 2 reported she’s not\nsure when and who Staff 1 is going to put his hands on.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/7/23.\nYouth A reported Youth B was in his room when Staff 1 entered\nthe pod. Youth A reported Youth B said, “if you put me on\nsanction, I’ll beat my door down”. Youth A reported Staff 1\nbecame really upset, was yelling loudly, and was making hand\nmotions. Youth A could not remember anything Staff 1 said. Youth\nA reported Staff 1 opened Youth B’s door and Supervisor and\nStaff 2 were trying to get Staff 1 away from the door. Youth A\nreported he felt if Staff 1 got in Youth B’s room, he would have\nfought Youth B because that’s how angry he was acting. Youth A\nreported he’s never seen Staff 1 act like that before.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/7/23.\nYouth B reported Youth C was in his room and was upset, so he\nwas throwing things around, and Staff 2 called a Code 2 over the\nradio. Youth B reported when Staff 1 came onto the pod, he\nalready looked like he was angry because of his posture. Youth B\nreported Youth C was mouthing off to Staff 1, which was making\nStaff 1 angrier. Youth B reported Staff 1 left the pod, and when he\ncame back, he went straight for Youth B’s room and opened the\ndoor. Youth B reported Staff 2 and Supervisor quickly slammed\nhis door so Staff 1 couldn’t enter. Youth B reported he felt like\nStaff 1 was going to come in the room and beat him up due to the\nway he was acting. Youth B reported Staff 1 swelled his upper\nchest, his veins in his arms were popping and he was yelling.\nYouth B reported he couldn’t hear much of what Staff 1 was\n6",
    "saying because he was yelling in the main pod area, and Youth B\nwas in his room. Youth B reported he’s never seen Staff 1 act like\nthat before.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/7/23.\nYouth C reported he couldn’t remember anything that happened\nor anything that was said on 9/3/23 because he was enraged and\nhaving his own issues at the time.\nYouth D was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/7/23.\nYouth D reported he was sitting in the pod when he heard yelling\nfrom a lot of different voices. He reported he could not remember\nwho was yelling or what they were yelling. Youth D reported\nSupervisor told everyone to go to their rooms because she was\nlocking down the pod. Youth D reported he doesn’t remember\nanything that happened during the incident besides people yelling.\nYouth E was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/7/23.\nYouth E reported on 9/3/23 Staff 1 was very angry, which she\nknew because his chest was puffed up. Youth E reported he\nlooked like he wanted to hit Youth B and she believes if he would\nhave gotten in the room, he would have beaten Youth B up. Youth\nE could not remember anything Staff 1 said during the incident.\nYouth H was no longer at the facility at the time of the\ninvestigation.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 9/3/23 was reviewed. Youth A, Youth D, Youth\nE, Youth F and Youth H are in the main pod area with Staff 1.\nYouth B is in his room looking out the window facing the pod. Staff\n1 is seen walking around in the pod and he is talking, but it is\nunclear what he is saying or who he is talking to. He walks to the\ndoor and gets the mop bucket brought to him by another staff. He\nbegins walking with the mop bucket towards Youth C’s room at\nthe other end of the pod. As he walks past Youth B’s room, it\nlooks like Youth B is banging on his door. Staff 1 turns to Youth\nB’s room and says “Y’all gonna make me work out now huh?”.\nYouth B says “Workin out on who?” and Staff 1 replies “On\nwhoever I gotta work out on”. Youth B says “You ain’t gonna work\nout on me” and Staff 1 replies “Shiiit, how much you wanna bet?”.\nYouth B says “I’ll bet” but it’s unclear what amount he says. Then\nStaff 1 says “okay, let’s get it. If they callin’ me down there, I’m\ndoin’ what the fuck I have to do. I promise you.” Youth B continues\nto talk but it’s unclear what he says. Then Staff 1 begins yelling\nloudly (unclear what he is saying), walks towards Youth B’s door\n7",
    "and stands in front of his door continuing to yell. Supervisor and\nStaff 1 are seen coming into view of the camera and go stand in\nbetween Staff 2 and Youth B’s door. Staff 2 is still yelling loudly,\nand he is heard saying “We will see”. Supervisor or Staff 1 tells\nStaff 2 to “Take a break” and Staff 1 begins walking towards the\nmop bucket. Staff 1 puts up a poster board on Youth B’s window,\nwhile Supervisor is heard telling Staff 1 “Take a break”. Staff 1\ntakes the mop bucket and walks towards Youth C’s room, with\nStaff 2 closely behind him. Supervisor again says, “Take a break”\nand either Staff 2 or Supervisor say “Take a break, come on, not\nnow, not now. Come on [Staff 1] take a break”. However, Staff 1\nremains in the pod by Youth C’s door with Staff 2 by him.\nSupervisor begins walking over while Staff 2 key fobs the door by\nYouth C’s room and pushes Staff 1 out the door. As Staff 1 exits\nhe says “man, y’all trippin’”. Staff 2 and Supervisor are at the end\nof pod by Youth C’s room talking. It is unclear if they are talking to\neach other, talking to Youth C or both. Then they turn and begin\ntalking to Youth D. It is unclear what they are discussing because\nthere is yelling coming from other youth, and then loud banging\nnoises. One of the youth in their rooms yells “Let me out!” but it is\nunclear who. Then Supervisor is heard saying “I can’t right now. I\ncan’t, you have to listen”. Supervisor walks over to Youth B’s door,\nremoves the poster board and yells “Listen! I’m doing everything I\ncan”. The youth continue talking and she yells “Listen! Be quiet!”.\nStaff 2 stands next to her. Staff 1 re-enters the pod through the\nother side door, and stands in front of Youth B’s door, behind\nSupervisor. Supervisor is yelling, but it is unclear what she’s\nsaying. She then says “[Youth C] don’t go there. I got a job to do. I\ncan’t let you out”. Supervisor motions with her hands and tells all\nthe youth in the pod to go back to their rooms, so they begin to\ncomply. Staff 1 yells “Y’all don’t run this facility man” then walks\ntowards Youth B’s door shaking his hand and yells “Hey! Y’all\ndon’t run this facility”. Youth A, Youth D, Youth F & Youth H\nremain in the pod area, while Youth E is standing in the doorway\nto her room. Supervisor yells “Let’s go!” towards the youth in the\nmain pod. Staff 1 continues yelling “You don’t run this facility”\nmultiple times and using hand gestures towards Youth B. Youth A\nand Youth F wait by the side door of the pod while Staff 1 interacts\nwith Supervisor. Youth H is on the couch by Youth B’s room. Staff\n1 gets closer to Youth B’s door, while continuing to yell at him, and\nYouth H stands up and backs away. Staff 1 yells “I run this, now\nback up!” towards Youth B and Staff 1 leans over towards the key\nfob pad and begins to open Youth B’s door. Supervisor turns her\nhead and yells “[Staff 1] uh-uh, no!”, then runs towards Youth B’s\ndoor and attempts to shut it. Staff 1 holds his arm up and uses it to\npush Supervisor back while he still tries to open the door. Staff 2\n8",
    "runs over to assist Supervisor, puts her arms around Staff 1 and\npulls him backwards. As a result, Supervisor is successful in\nshutting Youth B’s door, and then stands in front of it to block Staff\n1 from accessing it again. Staff 1, Staff 2 and Supervisor are\nyelling, but it is unclear what is being said. Staff 1 uses her whole\nbody to pin Staff 2 backwards against a chair, while she holds his\narm. Supervisor yells at Staff 1 and says “You can’t do that”\nmultiple times while remaining in front of Youth B’s door. Staff 2\nholds Staff 1’s arm and pulls him out of the pod area while he\nwalks behind her.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Juvenile Transition Center Code of Ethics (12/20/21)\noutlines the standards for professional relationships and\nprofessional conduct with youth, the public and other\nemployees within the facility. Any behavior displayed by a\nstaff member which is indicative of unprofessional\nrelationships is prohibited. Serving as a negative role model\nto residents through individual actions (i.e. swearing,\nbreaking facility rules, etc.) is prohibited. It also outlines\nP.E.E.C. (Professionalism, Emotional Control, Extenuating\nCircumstances and Confidence) – an employee’s guide to\nself-control. It notes staff should not take acting out\npersonally and staff must learn to respond effectively to\nacting out behaviors. It notes staff might experience\nagitation, anxiety, anger, or fear in a crisis, but must be\nable to monitor their own feelings and maintain emotional\ncontrol. It notes staff are to maintain appropriate emotional\nresponses by using Handle with Care De-escalation\ntechniques. Lastly, the document also outlines expectations\nfor Juvenile Detention Officers/Shift Leads, which includes\nnot swearing, yelling, using crude language, arguing, or\ntalking down to residents or staff.\no Muskegon County Juvenile Transition Center Code\nof Ethics Acknowledgement Receipt signed by Staff\n1 on 7/15/21 and Code of Conduct\nAcknowledgement Receipt signed by Staff 1 on\n2/6/22.\n• Email from CA dated 9/7/23 states “Staff 1 has been\ncoached and trained on verbal de-escalation and regulating\nhis responses throughout his employment at the facility.\nStaff 1 was disciplined for similar behavior against\ncoworkers in June 2023. Due to his outburst and a pattern\nof negative emotional regulation, a condition of his\ndiscipline was a mandatory referral to the Employee\n9",
    "Assistance Program (EAP) to support and assist him on\nmanaging his emotions”. Staff 1 completed the counseling\nper email notification (below).\no Email from Human Resources Manager dated\n7/26/23 stating Staff 1 completed his mandatory\nreferral process.\n• Staff 1 completed Handle with Care training on 7/25/22 and\n7/20/23, which includes verbal de-escalation training as\nwell as verbal and physical interventions with youth. Staff 1\nhas 2 disciplinary actions and 9 coaching sessions in his\nemployee file. Concerns like those in this investigation are\noutlined below:\no Notice of Suspension without pay (6/23/23-6/24/23)\ndue to Staff 1 displaying unprofessional conduct\nwhile on duty as an acting lead at the facility.\nReferral was made to the Employee Assistance\nProgram. Notes on 6/20/23, employees reported\nStaff 1 used aggressive and unprofessional\nlanguage and behavior in the breakroom. It was\nreported Staff 1 was abrasive in his physical and\nverbal demeanor, was loud, and made gender\ncomments and threats towards female employees.\nIn the summary of Staff 1’s response, he reported\nhis voice was elevated, but denied making any\ngender-based comments or threats. Staff 1 reported\nhe could have handled the situation better and\nadmitted he got triggered.\no 8/29/23 – Teacher reported a concern to CA\nregarding an interaction she had with Staff 1.\nTeacher reported she motioned for Staff 1 to stop\ntapping a desk and he responded verbally\naggressively and said he “was a grown man and\ncould do what he wanted”. Staff 1 reported “he could\nhave reacted better and used a more appropriate\ntone but overshadowed the ownership by\ncomplaining about minor issues he’s had with\nTeacher in the past.” CA expressed expectations of\nproper communication (professional and respectful)\nmoving forward.\no 8/29/22 – coaching session with Staff 1 regarding\nreceiving feedback and emotional responses.\no 9/1/23 – coaching session with Staff 1 regarding\nStaff 1 making gender comments about himself\nduring interactions with Teacher earlier in the week.\n10",
    "Analysis Based on interviews conducted, video footage reviewed, and\ndocumentation reviewed, Staff 1 does not demonstrate he is\nemotionally stable to perform his assigned duties. Staff’s\ninappropriate and aggressive interactions with youth and staff\nhave been well documented by the facility and the facility has\nfollowed through with coaching, training, and a referral for\ncounseling sessions with the Employee Assistance Program.\nUnfortunately, none of these avenues have resulted in long-term\nchanges for Staff 1 and Staff 1 fails to fully take responsibility or\nrecognize how his actions affect others, even after watching the\nvideo footage with Consultant. In addition, Staff 1 demonstrates a\npattern of behavior in which he has repeatedly violated multiple\nareas of the Code of Conduct for employees, specifically related\nto professional relationships and emotional control, which are\noutlined above.\nConsultation:\n• CA reported on 9/13/23 they intend to have Staff 1\ncomplete a psychological evaluation before having any\ncontact with youth, which DCWL is in support of.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nSeptember 14, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 18, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"
