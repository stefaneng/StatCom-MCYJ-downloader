All of the supervisors carried a caseload until March and April of\n2023. This did have an impact on the agency's data analytics as all\nmanagers/supervisors had increased duties to work toward ensuring that the\nchildren remained in safe, stable placements while permanency was achieved.\nDespite this continued changed, the agency has put a great emphasis on the in-\nhouse training of staff and managers beyond CWTI and NSI to strengthen skill\nsets, build competency and improve knowledge of program policies and\nprocedures. The current Corrective Action Plan has been used as a guide for\ntraining and tracking. The managers continue to review areas of the plan in all\nstaff meetings and in individual unit meetings.

However, they feel supported by their coworkers and the administrative",
    "staff stating they have an open-door policy, and they can discuss any job-related\nissues at any time.\nThere were no youth interviews.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment. Case files are\nstored in locked rooms/cabinets which prevent unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
