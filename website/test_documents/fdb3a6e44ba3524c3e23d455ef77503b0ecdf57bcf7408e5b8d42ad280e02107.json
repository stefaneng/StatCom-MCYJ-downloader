INVESTIGATION\nRule Code License recommendation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12325\nSection (1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nDescription appropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained\nin the foster home evaluation and any special evaluations.\n1",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The findings of fact for this investigation potentially warranted\nadverse licensing action related to the foster parent’s license. The\nagency established willful and substantial violations, yet the\nagency recommended a CAP and no change in license status.\nInvestigation Documents Reviewed:\nI reviewed the special evaluation report including the analysis,\nfindings, and recommendations. The agency findings\nappropriately determined noncompliance with three foster home\nlicensing rules, Rules 403 (1)(a) and (b) Foster Parent Duties and\n201(1)(d) Foster home applicant/licensee qualifications; central\nregistry check. However, the license recommendation did not fit\nwith the severity of the violation. The recommendation for the\nlicense was to complete a CAP with no changes to the terms of\nthe license. Rule 403(a) was in noncompliance because the\nfoster parent acknowledged not following the safety plan for the\nyouth by giving the youth a cell phone. Rule 403(b) was in\nnoncompliance due to the foster parent not keeping the agency\nfully informed regarding the progress/behaviors of the foster care\nyouth. Rule 201(1)(d) noncompliance was due to the foster parent\nnot demonstrating an adequate understanding of the proper care\nof the youth by allowing the youth to have a tattoo needle/sharp\nobject so Youth A could pierce Youth A’s nose and belly button.\nA stronger CAP was needed to ensure compliance with the areas\nidentified in noncompliance. A recommendation related to the\nterms of the license related to a change in age and type of\nappropriate behaviors for placement would also be acceptable.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Administrator on 6/17/2024, 8/15/2024, and\n8/16/2024 regarding my preliminary findings and final\ndeterminations. Administrator stated the worker that completed\nthe foster home special evaluation that was reviewed is no longer\nwith the agency. Administrator stated that since the opening of\nthis special investigation the relevant agency staff have taken the\nopportunity to review the situation and discuss various alternatives\nto what can be done differently to avoid a future similar\noccurrence/outcome.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance with rule 400.12325-1.\nThe outcome of the foster home evaluation was appropriate in\ndetermining noncompliance with the rules associated with the\nfoster home evaluation. However, the recommendations\n2",
    "associated with that determination were inadequate to establish\ncompliance and ensure the maintenance of compliance. The\nreport did not indicate any consideration for modifying/considering\nchanges to what placement characteristics are appropriate for this\nhome.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2024C0000896SI; CAP approved 12/15/23\nRule Code License recommendation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12325\nSection (3) Except for an original license, an agency shall\nDescription recommend to the department the issuance of a regular\nlicense or the continuation of an active license only when\nall rules are in compliance, or both of the following\nconditions exist:\n(b) A written corrective action plan has been developed.\nThe plan must comply with all of the following\nrequirements:\n(i) Upon determining a rule noncompliance that is\ncorrectable by the foster parent, the agency must\ndevelop a written corrective action plan with the\nfoster parent on the form prescribed by the\ndepartment.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Corrective action plan developed for the areas of noncompliance\nis inadequate to establish compliance.\nInvestigation Documents Reviewed:\nI reviewed the special evaluation report including the analysis,\nfindings, and recommendations. The agency findings\nappropriately determined noncompliance with three foster home\nlicensing rules, Rules 403-1-a, 201-1-d, and 403-1-b. However,\nthe CAP that was developed to establish and maintain compliance\nwas inadequate.\nThe CAP that was reviewed for the foster home special evaluation\nonly identified Rule 403(1)(b) rule noncompliance. The only action\nsteps associated with the CAP was for the foster parent to attend\ntraining related to parenting teens, and teens and trauma, and the\nworker would follow up monthly to ensure the trainings were\ncompleted.\n3",
    "Interviews:\nI interviewed Administrator on 6/17/2024, 8/15/2024, and\n8/16/2024 regarding my preliminary findings and final\ndeterminations. Administrator stated the worker that completed\nthe foster home special evaluation and CAP that was reviewed is\nno longer with the agency. Administrator stated that since the\nopening of this special investigation the relevant agency staff have\ntaken the opportunity to review the situation and discuss various\nalternatives to what can be done differently to avoid a future\nsimilar occurrence/outcome.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance with rule 400.12325-3-b-i.\nThe outcome of the foster home evaluation was appropriate in\ndetermining noncompliance with the rules associated with the\nfoster home evaluation. However, the corrective action plan\nassociated with that determination was inadequate to establish\ncompliance and ensure the maintenance of compliance.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n09/06/2024\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n09/06/2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n4"
