    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe agency requested approval for use of existing space in the facility that was\npreviously utilized for a Day Treatment Program. The Day Treatment Program has\nbeen moved to another location and the agency wishes to use this space for waking\nhours programming for the secure residential treatment program youth.\nIII.

All clear for use.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe existing space in the facility includes a sizable dayroom with several tables and\ntwo computer terminals for school work completion, a classroom, therapy/visitation\nrooms, meeting rooms, staff offices, program/multi-use room, storage closets,\nrestrooms, lockers, and a kitchen. All of these areas are staff secured and most are\nincluded in the facility’s electronic monitoring and security system. There are 15\nnew cameras in this area and all are tied to the control center, as are the locked\n2",
    "doors. There is also an outdoor courtyard off of the day room. The courtyard does\nhave an 8 foot cement wall but it could be scaled. The agency reports that the youth\nwill be staff secured when in this area and precautions will be taken to ensure youth\ndo not escape.\nThe court has granted standing day passes for the girls treatment program,\nhowever, the agency was advised that in the event a youth does escape from the\ncourtyard, notification procedures will need to be followed as they pertain to escape\nfrom a secured facility.\nThe residential youth will be escorted to this area of the building for waking hours\nand transition back to the original area for sleeping hours. Breakfast, then school,\nlunch, therapy groups, service work, leisure activities, dinner, chores, group, and\nleisure time will all be conducted in the new area. The kitchen area will be for\nserving prepared meals and not used for cooking. The commercial kitchen in the\noriginal section will prepare meals and they will be brought to this kitchen and\nserved.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend approval for use of the new space as part of the secure residential\ntreatment program.\nSeptember 11, 2014\n_____________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved by:\n____September 11, 2014_\nGregory V.
