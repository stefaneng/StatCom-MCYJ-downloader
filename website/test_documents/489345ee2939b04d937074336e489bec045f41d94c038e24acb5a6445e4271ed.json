    "There was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. Special evaluation 2023C0000619 was initiated on 5/22/2023 regarding\nallegations a licensed foster parent was utilizing corporal punishment as discipline.\nThe licensed foster parent was found to be in violation of licensing rules and agency\npolicy. A CAP was put in place and was successfully completed on 7/28/2023.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The\nagency interim inspection was completed on 6/1/2023 and the CAP was approved\non 6/25/2023. The agency was cited for 14 violations, 10 of which were repeated\nthis year. Of those 10, there was an improvement in individual incident of non-\ncompliance within 3 (medical passports, DHS 1105's, FTM's) of the violation areas\nand an increase in the number of individual incidents in 3 areas (special\ninvestigation report within 15 days of investigation conclusion, placement outlines,\nPATP signatures). 4 areas stayed the same from last year's audit (supervisor\napproval, IL program statement, IL policies/procedures and IL contract). In 2022, 9\nviolations were established, 5 of which were repeated this year. All of the repeated\nviolations remain close to the name number of individual incidents of non-\ncompliances except for PATP signatures which had an increase for the current\naudit. The agency will need to establish additional corrective planning for the\nrepeated violations to ensure a reduction of incidents.\nSpecial investigation 2024C0001080SI was completed on 1/26/2024 and the CAP\nwas approved on 2/29/2024. The agency was found in non-compliance as the\nagency opened a satellite office prior to obtaining DCWL approval. The agency's\nCAP included updating a pre-existing checklist for office moves to include\nobtaining DCWL approval prior to making such a move. The agency has complied\nwith the CAP action steps and no further concerns have been noted.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated the agency has had some difficulties due to staff turnover. In addition,\nthe assessment reports the agency dealt with a relatively high number of\nplacement changes (77). As a result of the previous year CAP the agency held\nmultiple policy and rule fresher training sessions. They have also created and\nutilized new tracking tools they feel have been useful in all areas but notably\nlicensing.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility’s\nbudget and the agency’s financial audit.",
    "Staff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisor and coworkers are available to assist as\nneeded. Staff did not report any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains suffice office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n______5/22/2024___________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n5/31/2024\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
