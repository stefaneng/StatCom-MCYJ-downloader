An exception was not completed in\nMiSACWIS.\nFOM 801-03 Medical Passport\nPages 2-3\nThe health screens within the MiSACWIS Health Profile section\nmust be updated quarterly to ensure the child's current health\ninformation is up-to-date and accurate.\nAn updated medical passport is provided to:\n Participating legal parents, if the child is a temporary\ncourt ward.\no Quarterly, while in out-of-home placement.\no At reunification.\no The child’s foster care provider: At or prior to each\nplacement.

    "Three of eleven foster care and independent living case files did not meet this\nrequirement.\nFile one: Quarterly passports were not updated from March 2020 to June 2021. The\n6/22/21 passport did not have the parent’s signature.\nFile two: A quarterly update was missing for June 2021.\nFile three: A medical passport was on file for 12/11/20.

Either form\nmust be completed in entirety, sent via email (encrypted for non-\nstate employees) to the FC-PMOU mailbox or faxed within five\ndays of receipt of the form.\nOne of three independent living files did not have informed consent documented for\nseveral psychotropic medications.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n The agency was reminded to ensure all foster home visit contact entries\ninclude the information required for quality home visit standards in FOM 722-\n06H, page 2.\n The agency was reminded to ensure the education tab in MiSACWIS is\nupdated with required information at the end of each school year per FOM\n723, page 8.\n Case contacts- several foster home visits were entered as “case contact”,\nwhich limits the ability to search for visits in MiSACWIS. The agency was\nreminded to mark the proper identifying information for all contacts.\n Family Team Meetings- all 1105 reports should identify on the first and last\npage, who attended and how they attended. If someone is not present in\nperson, the signature page should indicate the name and “attended via\nphone/zoom”.\n Licensing renewal applications- the agency was reminded to ensure that all\nfoster home renewal notification letters indicate an application is enclosed.\n PATP signatures- Some PATPs held the required signature, but the signature\nwas undated. Therefore, it could not be verified that the PATP was signed\nwithin the 30-day requirement. The agency was advised to check dates with\nsignatures before uploading to MiSACWIS. If a parent refuses to sign or\n10",
    "cannot be located, the worker should write refused or unable to locate on the\nsignature line, at the 30-day mark.\n Signatures- The MDHHS Policy office recently clarified that PATPs and\nMedical Passports need to be signed by any non-respondent parent that has\nplacement of their child. This non-respondent parent must sign as the\n‘placement provider’. As this was previously unclear in policy, missing\nsignatures were not cited. However, the agency was advised this expectation\nwill be required going forward.\n Sibling visits- The agency was reminded that sibling visits occurring on the\nsame date as parenting time, need to be entered as a separate ‘sibling visit’\ncontact, in order for data to correctly reflect the visits that occur. If sibling\nvisits are not occurring, an exception should be completed in MiSACWIS.\n FTM 1105 reports- The agency was advised that policy requires the 1105\nreport to be uploaded within 7 days of the family team meeting.\n YAVFC and Independent Living- the agency was reminded that YAVFC is a\nlegal status. Youth with a legal status of YAVFC have different placement\ntypes, but are often that of Independent Living. Therefore, the agency is\nrequired to follow IL licensing rules for all YAVFC youth residing in an\nIndependent living placement.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period. A special evaluation was initiated by the agency in March 2021\ndue to an allegation of improper discipline. Upon investigation it was determined the\nfoster parent hit a child with a shoe. A violation was established, and a CAP\ndeveloped. Documentation in the file confirmed the CAP was completed in May\n2021. Overall, the agency appears to have completed a thorough investigation and\naddressed the violation appropriately.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP approved 12/21/20 was the\nresult of the renewal evaluation dated 11/18/20. During this review the agency had\n17 violations, compared to 20 violations in the 2020 renewal evaluation. 5 of the 17\nwere repeat violations from 2020. While the agency reports sufficient implementation\nof the CAP and has shown improvement in many areas, there continues to be areas\nthat need attention. However, it was noted the agency underwent a significant\nnumber of staffing changes, which resulted in new staff being trained, mentored, and\nsupervised virtually due to COVID. This appears to have impacted compliance in\nsome areas. With the development of a new CAP, and staff having gained some\nexperience over the past few months, the agency anticipates increased compliance\n11",
    "in all areas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment indicated several challenges this year. In\naddition to COVID and staff working remotely, there has been a significant staff\nturnover including six experienced staff, a supervisor and other staff on medical\nleave, an increase in caseloads, and the loss of some clerical support staff. The CA\nreported delays in hiring new staff due to a limited pool of applicants. In the\nmeantime, to alleviate the caseloads, several cases were transferred to private\nagencies. Despite these difficulties, the CA reported their CAP has been\nimplemented and the team completes regular internal audits to monitor for\ncompliance. Overall, the CA indicated the agency has shown improvement in many\nareas. Although there are still areas that need attention.\nInterviews\nOne foster care and one licensing staff were interviewed. Staff indicated there has\nbeen some significant turn over this past year, which has been challenging.\nHowever, they stated that hiring is in process and relief is coming. Both staff\nreported working a combination of in person and remotely. Staff indicated the\nworkload is manageable once they learned how to balance working from home. Staff\nstated their co-workers, supervisors and administration are supportive and\nknowledgeable. Neither staff had any suggestions on areas of improvement for the\nagency.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n_ __________________October 27, 2021___\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n12",
