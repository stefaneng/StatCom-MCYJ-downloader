The investigation found a sufficient number of staff were present, but it substantiated a failure to follow the facility's own supervision policy, as staff did not maintain line-of-sight supervision on the offending youth, which is a repeat violation. Management is directly culpable for this ongoing failure to enforce its written supervision procedures.",

  },

    "level": "moderate",
    "justification": "The substantiated violation is for failure to follow the facility's internal supervision policy (Rule 400.4109), which required line-of-sight supervision of youth. This failure of supervision allowed a youth-on-youth assault to occur (Youth B throwing a container at Youth A, causing a laceration requiring hospital treatment). According to the instructions, 'Environmental or supervision failures' including 'youth-on-youth conflict escalating due to lack of supervision' are categorized as Moderate SIRs. The violation is not 'Severe' because the primary finding is the supervision policy failure, not a violation directly categorized under 'Safety and Violence' for the assault itself (which was an outcome of the supervision failure)."
