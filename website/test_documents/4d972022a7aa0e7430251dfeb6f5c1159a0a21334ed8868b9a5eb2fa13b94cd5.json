Suite 2\nhas a separate entrance at the front of the home. The way the home is set up will\nnot allow for youth in Suite 1 to mix with the young adults in Suite 2.\nUpon entering Suite 1 is a staff desk and a long hallway. Off the long hallway are\nfive bedrooms, an enclosed stairwell, a closet, a furnace room, and elevator. The\nfirst of the five bedrooms is a large room that is set up to house a parenting youth.\nThis room can also be set up to house 2 youth. All other bedrooms are set up for\ntwo youth with beds and storage for belongings. Each bedroom has its own\nbathroom and windows to the outside. All beds have appropriate bedding.\nThe enclosed stairway located in the long hallway leads down to the lower level or\nup to the second floor. The door at the top of the stairs leading to the second floor\nis locked so it cannot be accessed by the youth. The second floor is only utilized\nby the young adults who have a separate stairway they will use to access the 2nd\nfloor. The second stairway is located in Suite 2 and cannot be accessed by the\nyouth. The lower level can be accessed by youth and houses offices, a\nrecreations room, storage rooms, laundry, a meeting room, bathroom, and the\nkitchen.

The elevator is only to be utilized with a staff member who will ensure the\nyouth and adults do not mix.\nThe facility is protected by an alarm and video surveillance. It is clean, well-\norganized, and appropriately equipped to house 10 youth.\nB. Program Description\nThe Jackson House is a program of Gateway Youth Services through Child &\nFamily Charities. It will be set up the same as the current Kevin Moody Youth\nHome which is comprised of two programs under the CCI license.\nThe Higher Ground program is designed for youth who are in crisis and in need of\nimmediate shelter.
