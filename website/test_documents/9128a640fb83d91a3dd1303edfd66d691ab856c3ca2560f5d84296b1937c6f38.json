Youth A said on\nWednesday, May 31, 2023, she was in her room around 8pm for\nmedication passing and ripped up her shirt and tied it around her\nneck. Youth A said Supervisor saw she had the shirt around her\nneck but did not come into her room but rather did checks on her.\nYouth A said Staff 1, Staff 5, and Supervisor were “dealing” with\nYouth B so she did not get her medications right away. Youth A\nsaid when Staff 5 began to pass her medications to her she\nwalked out of her room and Supervisor and Staff 1 went “right into\na restraint” while Staff 5 called for other staff assistance. Youth A\nsaid Supervisor “pushed” her into her room and attempted to close\nher door, but she would not allow it to be shut. Youth A said Staff\n1 and Staff 2 “grabbed” her and tried to hold her arms and she\nsaid she was “crawling” her legs up the wall to get out of their\nhold. Youth A said someone grabbed her legs and she fell face-\ndown on her bed. Youth A said Staff 2 switched with Supervisor\nand Supervisor held her face-down on her bed with her arms\npulled up behind her back.

Youth A denied\nhaving any bruising or swelling on her arm.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 5,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth B said\nshe is on the same pod at Youth A. Youth B said Youth A does\n2",
    "not like Supervisor as “he makes her mad”. Youth B said she was\nin her room and did not see any of the restraint but did hear what\nwas going on. Youth B said Youth A refused her medications and\nthen said she wanted them, so staff were passing her medications\nto her. Youth B said Youth A must have been trying to get out of\nher room because she heard staff tell her to go back in her room.\nYouth B said staff were clearing out Youth A’s room. Youth B said\nshe saw four staff and Supervisor on the unit that night. Youth B\nsaid she heard Youth A crying and saying she wanted her mother.\nYouth B said the following day Youth A told her that Supervisor\nbent her arm during the restraint causing it to hurt.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 5,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker.

Youth D\nsaid Supervisor, Staff 2 and Staff 5 were the staff to restrain Youth\nA. Youth D said Youth A pushed Staff 5 to get out of her room and\nStaff 5 called for staff assistance. Youth D said Supervisor and\nStaff 5 “pushed” Youth A back into her room. Youth D said once\nYouth A was in her room, she was not able to see anything else\nthat occurred in the bedroom.

Staff 1 said Staff 5 was\npassing Youth A’s medication and he was present for\n“awareness”. Staff 1 said Youth A took her medications and then\nbegan to push Staff 5 to get into common area. Staff 1 said he\nescorted Youth A back into her room as it was bedtime, and she\nwas not to be in the common area. Staff 1 said when he went to\nshut the door Youth A put her hands over the handle so it could\nnot be shut. Staff 1 said Staff 2 arrived for assistance and Youth A\nbegan to “swing on them”. Staff 1 said Staff 2 had walked towards\nYouth A and she backed up in a corner of her room. Staff 1 said\nall other staff began to clear Youth A’s room due to her having tied\nsomething around her neck earlier in the evening. Staff 1 said\nYouth A punched Staff 2 so he went into a restraint. Staff 1 said\nhe then began to help clear out Youth A’s room and was not\ndirectly involved in the restraint. Staff 1 said at one point he was\naware Youth A was on her bed however did not see her\npositioning. Staff 1 said once everything was cleared out of Youth\nA's room all staff exited the room and he went back to his unit.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 5,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Staff 2 said he\nwas called to Youth A’s pod for a staff assistance call on\nWednesday, May 31, 2023.

Staff 2 said Supervisor waved him close and\nthen went into an escort to move Youth A away from her door.\nStaff 2 said he was holding Youth A when Staff 1 grabbed his\nbeltloop pulling him backward, so he released thinking they were\nready to leave the room. Staff 2 said as soon as he let go of Youth\nA she jumped up on her bed and began to punch Staff 1 so he\nwent back into a restraint and Youth A fell in the prone position on\nher bed. Staff 2 said Supervisor was holding Youth A and had one\nof her arms placed behind her back. Staff 2 said they are trained\nto flip youth over if they are prone. Staff 2 said no one said\nanything about flipping Youth A over. Staff 2 said Youth A was\nprone for about a minute. Staff 2 said once the items were cleared\nfrom Youth A’s room everyone exited and she was released.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 5,\n2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Staff 3 said he\nwas passing medications on his pod when he was called for staff\nassistance on Youth A’s pod. Staff 3 said when he arrived the\nmedication cart was in front of Youth A’s door, and she was\npunching one of the staff in her bedroom. Staff 3 said he began to\n4",
    "help remove items from Youth A’s room and was not paying close\nattention to the staff that were handling Youth A inside the room.\nStaff 3 said he removed Youth A’s mattress, and she was not\nlaying on it at that time. Staff 3 said once he removed the mattress\nother staff were handing things to him out of the room so he did\nnot go back inside the room but rather took things from the staff\ninside and moved it out in the common area of the pod. Staff 3\nsaid he did not see Youth A in the prone position. Staff 3 said he\nwas trained to flip the youth over if they are prone as soon as it is\nsafe to do so.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via telephone on June 6, 2023, in\ncollaboration with the MDHHS worker. Staff 4 said he was\npassing medications on his own unit when he was called for\nassistance on Youth A’s unit. Staff 4 said once he arrived the\nother staff were attempting to deescalate Youth A as she was\nupset and yelling. Staff 4 said he was told to help clear out Youth\nA's room so he went into Youth A’s room and Staff 2 had Youth A\nin a standing restraint hold. Staff 4 said he was walking in and out\nof the room clearing items out and at some point noticed Staff 2\nhad let go of Youth A and she was to punching Staff 2. Staff 4 said\nhe was then out of the room getting items handed to him and saw\nthat Staff 2 and Supervisor had Youth A face down on her bed.\nStaff 4 said Staff 2 and Supervisor were holding Youth A's arms\ndown by her side when he saw them. Staff 4 said he remembered\nhearing someone say they needed to flip Youth A over however\nhe did not see how the restraint ended as he was out in the\ncommon area so was unsure if she was flipped onto her back or\nnot. Staff 4 said he was trained to flip a youth over as soon as\nthey are able if they go to the ground in a prone position.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via telephone on June 15, 2023, in\ncollaboration with the MDHHS worker. Staff 5 said she was\nworking Youth A’s unit on May 31, 2023. Staff 5 said Youth A had\nbeen struggling throughout the evening and decided to go into her\nroom and take a break around 8:30pm. Staff 5 said when she\nwent to pass Youth A her night medications, Youth A refused and\nhad a t-shirt tied loosely around her neck. Staff 5 said between her\nand Supervisor they continued to do frequent checks on Youth A\nuntil she agreed to take her night medications. Staff 5 said Youth\nA was told she needed to remove the shirt from her neck, and she\nwould give Youth A her medication. Staff 5 said she handed Youth\nA her medications and Youth A set them on top of the medication\ncart and said she would also like some ibuprofen. Staff 5 got the\nibuprofen and added it to her night medication and Youth A took\nher medication. Staff 5 said Youth A then began to push past her\n5",
    "trying to get into the common area of the pod. Staff 5 said she\npushed the medication cart out of the way and blocked Youth A\nfrom leaving her doorway with her backside. Staff 5 said she did\nnot want Youth A to get anything from the medication cart which\nwas why she pivoted in that direction. Staff 5 said Staff 1 escorted\nYouth A back into her room and she called for staff assistance.\nStaff 5 said Staff 2 arrived and went in Youth A’s room to help\nStaff 1 and Supervisor. Staff 5 said Youth A was punching Staff 1\nand Staff 2 while she and other staff were clearing out Youth A’s\nroom due to the self-harm behaviors she had previously exhibited.\nStaff 5 said she did not see the entire restraint but did see at one\npoint Youth A, Staff 1 and Staff 2 all standing on Youth A’s bed,\nand Youth A was punching the staff. Staff 5 said she never saw\nYouth A in the prone position. Staff 5 said everything was very\nnoisy and chaotic during the incident that she does not recall\nYouth A saying anything specifically other than cussing and\nscreaming. Staff 5 said once everyone was out of the room she\nwent back and talked to Youth A about the incident. Staff 5 said at\nthat time Youth A did disclose her arm hurt so Staff 5 put in a\nmedical slip for Youth A’s arm. Staff 5 said she was trained to flip\na youth over as soon as possible if they go into a prone position.\nStaff 5 said she wrote the incident report after the situation to the\nbest of her ability without being a part of or seeing much of the\nrestraint.\nSupervisor was interviewed via telephone on June 15, 2023,\nin collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Supervisor said he\nwas helping out on Youth A’s pod the night of May 31, 2023.\nSupervisor said Youth C is Youth A’s “girlfriend” and had made a\ncomment to Youth A that upset her right at medication passing\ntime. Supervisor said Youth A got upset by whatever the comment\nwas from Youth C and tied a shirt loosely around her neck and\nbegan to run around her bedroom. Supervisor said he checked in\non Youth A and saw she was not in any distress and asked if she\nwanted to talk and she said “no” and then he asked if she was\nready to take her medications and she said “no” so he went to\nhelp Staff 5 with Youth B who was also struggling a few doors\ndown from Youth A’s room. Supervisor said he continued to do\nfrequent checks on Youth A encouraging her to take the shirt from\naround her neck. Supervisor said after a few minutes Youth A\nasked for her night medications and was told yes but that she\nneeded to remove the shirt from her neck which she agreed to do.\nSupervisor said Staff 5 opened Youth A’s door and passed her\nnight medications which she took and then began to violently\nshove past Staff 5 to get out into the common area. Supervisor\nsaid Staff 1 was also on the pod as he had been called down for\n6",
    "another situation so Supervisor and Staff 1 placed Youth A in an\nescort and moved her back in her room. Supervisor said Staff 5\ncalled for additional assistance while they were escorting Youth A\nback in her room and Staff 2 arrived and assisted Staff 1 by\nplacing Youth A in a standing restraint while he and the other staff\nbegan to clear out Youth A’s room due to the self-harm behaviors\nshe had previously exhibited. Supervisor said Youth A was\nstanding on her bed with her back against the wall punching any\nstaff that got close to her. Supervisor said at that point staff were\nnot able to exit the room until all the items were cleared from\nYouth A’s room for safety. Supervisor said Staff 1 and Staff 2 were\ngetting punched as they attempted to get Youth A into a secure\nhold. Supervisor said one of the staff tried to get ahold of Youth\nA’s arm and she fell forward landing prone on her bed. Supervisor\nsaid he took ahold of one of Youth A’s arms and held it loosely\nbehind her back so that she could not continue to punch.\nSupervisor said Staff 2 had Youth A’s other arm but was unsure if\nit was behind her back or to her side. Supervisor said Youth A was\nstruggling throughout the restraint. Supervisor said with the\nposition that Youth A landed he was not able to flip her onto her\nback as the wall would prevent him from rolling her one way and\nshe would fall off the bed if he rolled the other way so he held her\nuntil the staff completely cleared out her room and all staff exited\nand closed the door. Supervisor said he held her prone for less\nthan ten seconds.\nVideo Review:\nVideo footage of May 31, 2023, Youth A’s pod was reviewed\non June 5, 2023. Youth A is seen getting medications and then\nwalking out of her doorway. Staff 5 moves between Youth A and\nthe common area and Staff 1 and Supervisor place Youth A in an\nescort and walk her back into her room. Once Youth A is placed in\nher room there is no longer video footage of what occurs inside\nthe bedroom as there are no cameras in the room and no\ncameras that point into the room. Staff 5 is outside Youth A’s door\nand calls over the radio for assistance, Supervisor is standing in\ndoorway, Staff 1 in inside Youth A’s bedroom, and Youth A\ncontinues to state “I don’t give a fuck” as staff explain it is bedtime\nand they need to remove items from her room due to the self-\nharm incident. Staff 2 and Staff 4 arrive on pod and walk over to\nYouth A’s door. Youth A’s arm are seen swinging at the\nSupervisor making contact with his upper body at which time Staff\n2 and Staff 4 enter the room with Supervisor standing in doorway\nstating, “you will get to be out tomorrow, get off the door”. Staff 3\nenters the pod and walks over to Youth A’s room. Staff 4 exits\nYouth A’s room, leaving Staff 1 and Staff 2 in Youth A’s room.\n7",
    "Youth A is heard screaming “get the fuck off me bitch”. Supervisor\nstates, “put her in the corner and exit the room” and then enters\nthe room. Supervisor is seen moving items out of Youth A’s room.\nStaff 3, Staff 4, and Staff 5 all enter the room and remove items\nfrom the bedroom. Youth A is heard saying “ouch”, a staff is heard\nsaying “stop punching”. Youth A is heard saying “you pushed my\narm” and staff say “no”. Youth A is then heard crying and cussing.\nStaff 3, Staff 4, and Staff 5 finish moving items out of Youth A’s\nroom. Supervisor, Staff 2, and Staff 1 all walk out of Youth A’s\nroom and the door is closed. The entire duration of the incident,\nfrom the time Youth A is getting her medications until the time\nwhen all staff exit her room and close her door is three minutes\nand eighteen seconds.\nTour Observation:\nA tour of the facility occurred on June 5, 2023. A tour of girls\none pod was completed. Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, and Youth\nD’s rooms were viewed. During the tour I stood inside Youth C’s\nroom with the door closed and looked into Youth A’s room. When\nin Youth C’s room I was only able to see a small corner of Youth\nA's bed and none of the rest of the bedroom.

Staff 5\ndid not participate in the restraint and did not witness the\nentire restraint as she was clearing out Youth A’s room\ntherefore details from the restraint, including positioning,\nwere left out of the report.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance of youth restraint. Youth A\nreported she was in the prone position. Staff 2, Staff 4, and\nSupervisor all report Youth A being held in the prone position for\nvarying lengths of time.\nTechnical Assistance:\nIt is recommended the facility require the incident reports be\nwritten by the individual involved in the entire incident or restraint.\nIf that is not possible, having more than one staff provide a\nnarrative for the incident report in order to have all of the correct\ninformation included in the report.\n8",
