Youth A’s Mother did not provide written request for\nYouth A not to receive vaccinations until on or after 02/20/2025.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nRevision of Vista Maria’s consent for medical treatment form is\nneeded.

Youth A, Youth B and Youth C stated\nthey do not have concerns with male staff making aggressive\ncomments or inappropriate comments about a person’s body.\nThis allegation is not further investigated because Youth A, Youth\nB and Youth C do not have concerns and another Department of\nChild Welfare Licensing Consultant investigated a similar\nallegation in 2025SIC0000337 without findings.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance because Youth A, Youth B and\nYouth C did not express concerns with male staff speaking\naggressively and inappropriately about a person’s body.
