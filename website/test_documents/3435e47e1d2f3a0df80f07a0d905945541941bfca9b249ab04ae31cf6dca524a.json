    "Allegation Youth A was removed from a relative placement without adequate\ninformation and other relatives were not adequately assessed for\npossible placement.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Chief Administrator by phone on 8/13/2025. Chief\nAdministrator referred me to Recruitment Specialist and Program\nManager for additional information.\nI interviewed Recruitment Specialist by phone on 8/14/2025.\nRecruitment Specialist reported she was not involved in the\nchange in placement for Youth A and referred me to Program\nManager for additional information related to case management\nservices for Youth A.\nI interviewed Program Manager by phone on 10/17/2025.\nProgram Manager stated Foster Care Worker 1 was no longer\nwith the agency. Program Manager stated Foster Care Worker 1\nhad reported safety concerns related to the home of Relative 1.\nProgram Manager described communication issues between\nRelative 1 and Foster Care Worker 1. Program Manager stated\nan MDHHS worker had opened an investigation related to the\nsafety concerns identified for the home of Relative 1. Program\nManager stated the safety concerns were resolved and the\ninvestigation by MDHHS worker determined no findings following\nthe resolution of the identified safety concerns. Program Manager\nstated the agency is in the process of facilitating the return of\nYouth A to Relative 1. Program Manager stated the permanency\nplanning goal is for guardianship of Youth A with Relative 1.\nProgram Manager stated Foster Care Worker 1 did not work well\nwith Relative 1 to resolve the safety issues and instead created a\nmore adversarial relationship by reporting the issues for\ninvestigation instead of working to resolve the issues.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 2 by phone on 10/20/2025.\nFoster Care Worker 2 stated they are in the process of reuniting\nYouth A with Relative 1. Foster Care Worker 2 stated they are in\nthe process of scheduling a TDM meeting as a part of the\nreunification process. Foster Care Worker 2 stated Youth A has\nhad weekend visitation with Relative 1 with the resolution of the\nreported safety concerns. Foster Care Worker 2 confirmed the\npermanency planning goal for Youth A continues to be\nguardianship with Relative 1. Foster Care Worker 2 reported a\npositive working relationship with Relative 1. Foster Care Worker\n2 stated Foster Care Worker 2 did not have any current safety\nconcerns.\n2",
    "Attempts were made to contact/interview Foster Care Worker 1\non 10/16,10/17, and 10/20/2025. Voice mail messages were left\nwith no response from Foster Care Worker 1.\nI interviewed Relative 1 by phone on 10/20/2025. Relative 1\nstated Youth A was removed from Relative 1's home without\nenough being done to help Relative 1 correct the safety concerns\nreported by Foster Care Worker 1. Relative 1 reported they\nprovided the names of Relative 2, Relative 3, and Relative 4 for\nthe agency to assess for possible placement if Youth A was\nremoved from the home. Relative 1 reported she did not believe\nthe alternative relatives were contacted/assessed. Relative 1\nconfirmed Youth A is in the process of being returned to the care\nof Relative 1. Relative 1 reported a positive working relationship\nwith Foster Care Worker 2. Relative 1 stated Youth A has been\nhaving weekend visits with Relative 1 following the no findings by\nMDHHS worker. Relative 1 confirmed the permanency planning\ngoal for Youth A was to have guardianship with Relative 1.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the case record for Youth A. The case record\nindicated the parental rights of the mother of Youth A had\nbeen terminated. Paternity was established by the putative\nfather of Youth A. However, Father of Youth A is not\navailable for placement/supervision due to health and\nhousing conditions of Father. Relative 1 is the half-sister of\nYouth A, sharing the same father. Relative search\ndocumentation indicated Relative 1, Relative 3, Relative 5,\nRelative 6, and Relative 7 were identified for placement\nwhen Youth A entered care with Relative 1 being approved\nfor placement. Relative 6 and Relative 7 were determined\ninappropriate and assessments for the other relatives\nincluding Relative 2 and Relative 4 could not be located.\n• A TDM was held on 08/04/2025 related to the change in\nplacement of Youth A from Relative 1. Relative 1 was\nidentified as a participant in that TDM.\n• There was no documentation in the record to indicate a\nFoster Care Review Board hearing was held.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance with this rule. The findings\nof this investigation determined the agency did not do enough to\nresolve the safety concerns and maintain the stability of the\nplacement of Youth A with Relative 1. There was also inadequate\ndocumentation to determine the agency appropriately assessed\n3",
    "other possible relatives for placement of Youth A until the safety\nconcerns were resolved.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n10/21/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 22, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
