The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.10113 Employee records.\nThree references which are obtained before employment from\npersons unrelated to the employee.\nFour of six new employee files reviewed contained written references that were\nundated, making it unable to determine if they were completed prior to employment.\nR 400.10121 Direct care worker; qualifications.\n(1) A direct care worker shall have completed 30 semester\nhours of college or equivalent quarter hours.\n(2) In place of meeting the requirement specified in subrule (1)\nof this rule, a direct care worker shall have a minimum of a high\nschool diploma or its equivalent and 2 years of work experience\nin a facility of child caring institution.\nOne of six new employee files reviewed was found to have only 27 of the 30 college\ncredits required for direct care staff and did not have 2 years related experience at\nthe time of hire. As part of the CAP for this item, the facility would need to submit a\nvariance request to continue the employee’s employment, unless the remaining 3\ncredit hours can be accounted for.\n4",

The second file contained an ISP authored by the youth’s probation officer\nand not the social worker. The probation officer is not an employee of the facility.\n5",
