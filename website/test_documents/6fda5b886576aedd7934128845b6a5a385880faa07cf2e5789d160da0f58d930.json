    "INVESTIGATION:\nA phone call was received from the Chief Administer (CA) on 2/15/22. He indicated a\nstaff member conducted a restraint when one was not needed.\nInterviews:\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/23/22. CA\nreported Staff 1 was written up for the restraint he performed on 2/14/22. Staff 1 is a\nsupervisor and the Non-violent Crisis Intervention (restraint technique) trainer. His\nsupervisor is the Manager. CA reported him or the Manager will be present when\nStaff 1 conducts his trainings, and they will utilize this incident in their training. The\nCA was asked about spiritual hour and he reported it was an optional time for the\nyouth to be in their rooms.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/17/22 and 2/23/22. He\nreported he was restrained on Monday (2/14/22). He would not say who restrained\nhim. He was restrained face up after first being on his belly. He was mad so they\nrestrained him. He was not unsafe and did not need to be restrained. He was not\ninjured and did not have any concerns. He stated he likes Staff 1 because Staff 1 is\nfunny. When Staff 1 restrained him Staff 1 was mad and tried to push Youth A to the\nwall, but he pushed Youth A to the couch then to the ground. Staff 1 did not have\nany weight on his shoulder, but the other staff had their hands on his shoulders.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/23/22. He reported Youth A\nwas anxious after dinner and was acting erratically. Staff 1 was the supervisor who\nwas on shift, so he was called to the house. Youth A started to ride around on the\ndesk chairs. When Youth A got off the chair Staff 1 tried to take the chair and scoot it\naway. Staff 4 tried to move the other chair away and Youth A grabbed the chair.\nStaff 1 then went to engage Youth A because he was concerned about how Youth A\nwould respond to Staff 4. Staff 1 was facing Youth A, so he grabbed Youth A's\nforearms. Youth A then went backwards and Staff 1 went forward. They tumbled\nover the arm of the couch and landed on the floor. He was not sure how Youth A's\nbody landed. They ended face to face on the floor. He tried utilizing the interim\ncontrol position. Staff 1 stated he was on Youth A's side. Youth A has issues with\nfemale staff, so he had it in his head that he needed to physically intervene to keep\nStaff 4 (female staff) safe. Staff 1 grabbed onto Youth A's arms, and they fell over\nthe couch. Youth A then started to fight. He continued the hold due to safety. When\nthe two of them landed on the ground he was over the top of Youth A's body. He did\nnot put any weight on Youth A's body but remained on his tip toes, so he was not\nrestricting Youth A's breathing. Other staff came to assist. Staff 4 was holding Youth\nA's lower half and her foot was hurting her, so she switched out with Staff 5. Staff 1\nheld Youth A's right arm and Staff 5 was holding his left. Staff 2 and Staff 3 came to\nassist. Staff 1 disengaged, and Staff 3 took his place with Staff 2 on Youth A’s legs.\nHe removed himself as he was the focus of Youth A's anger. Staff 1 stated they are\ntaught to disengage a hold when it is safe to do so. He stated when Youth A was\nbiting and spitting it was more serious than the previous unsafe situation that caused\nhim to initiate the hold.\n3",
    "The Manager was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/23/22. The manager\nstated he is Staff 1's direct supervisor. He has not had any concerns with Staff 1.\nStaff 1 is very knowledgeable about Non-violent Crisis Intervention (NVCI) and just\nbecame certified to train. The Manager reviewed the video of the incident with Staff\n1 and Youth A. He stated people perceive a crisis or a threat differently. He believes\nthere is always something that can be done different in a restraint. He stated things\nare spiraling out of control because staff cannot restrain the youth.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/23/22. Staff 3 was called to\nthe house. Youth A was banging his head on the ground and was already in team\ncontrol. Youth A was on the floor next to the couch. Staff 2 and Staff 5 were holding\nYouth A on the ground. Staff 1 distanced himself from the situation because Youth A\nwas threatening Staff 1. He stated they are taught to back away from a youth when\nthey are trying to hurt them and that they can only restrain if there is intent to harm.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/23/22. She reported Youth A\nwas upset due to his phase being frozen. They have spiritual hour in their room, so\nhe was supposed to be in his room. He refused to be in his room and started to say\nhe was going to hurt himself. He finally went into his room and would not let the staff\nin. He was kicking the door when she was standing between the door and the frame.\nYouth A heard Staff 1's voice and he opened the door. Youth A left his room and\nbegan to mess with the chairs. Staff 4 grabbed a chair to keep it from him but Youth\nA grabbed it, so she let go. Staff 1 then went into a restraint with Staff 5 helping.\nThey went into the quiet area. She did not see how they got to the ground. She had\na cramp, so another staff took over for her. Youth A was banging his head on the\nground and spitting. She stated it happened too quick to really see how Youth A was\nbeing held when they went to the ground. Once on the ground Staff 1 was holding\nonto one of Youth A's arms. She never saw any part of Staff 1 on Youth A. She did\nnot have any concerns about the restraint. She stated they can restrain when there\nis risky behavior, or it is unsafe. Staff 1 thought Youth A was being aggressive.\nWhen Youth A is in that mindset, he is bound to do whatever.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/23/22. She stated she is a\nsupervisor on the weekends and the medical coordinator. She was called to Youth\nA's house via emergency procedures. She called the police per Staff 1's request.\nStaff 4 was hurt, and this left Staff 5 trying to gain control of Youth A. Staff 1 was\nstraddling over the top of Youth A but he did not have any weight on Youth A. Staff 1\nwas holding Youth A with one hand and holding Youth A's shirt up with the other\nhand. Staff 1 had one leg up with his foot on the floor and the other knee was down\non the floor. Staff 3 came and took over for Staff 1. Staff 1 then helped hold Youth\nA's legs. Youth A was spitting, biting, and banging his head on the ground. She\nstated the other two staff were newer staff so the restraint could have been\nsmoother. Staff 2 stated that spiritual hour is supposed to be in their room and quiet\nfor an hour. There are consequences if the youth do not comply.\n4",
    "Video Reviewed:\nVideo was provided by the CA and viewed at the facility on 2/23/22. It was viewed\nagain with the Area Manager via Zoom. The video showed Youth A walking around\nthe great room. He began to play with the chairs. Staff 2 pulls a chair away from\nYouth A, Youth A lets go and backs toward the wall. Staff 1 grabs Youth A from the\nfront. They end up falling over the arm of the couch and landing on the floor. Staff 1\nis facing Youth A and straddling over the top of him. He uses one arm to hold Youth\nA's shoulder and the other hand to pull up Youth A's shirt or coat to cover Youth A’s\nface with it. Staff 1's knee holds down Youth A's other shoulder and arm. Youth A\ntries to lift up his shoulders, but Staff 1 uses his knee to press Youth A to the floor.\nOther staff come in and take over for Staff 1.\nDuring the video review the CA admitted this was not a restraint technique that they\nteach.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Incident Report dated 2/14/22: With the exception of the following the rest of the\nincident report was consistent with the staff’s interviews. Staff 1 thought Youth A\nwas going to pick up the chair and throw it. This then led to Staff 1 engaging\nYouth A in a hold. Youth A resisted and the two of them fell over the couch\nlanding on the floor. The report did not indicate Staff 1 conducted an unapproved\nrestraint technique or that he was straddling over the top of Youth A.\n Staff 1 Employee File: Staff 1 had five disciplines in his file including the one\nfrom this incident. The other disciplines were for attendance and supervision.\n Youth A’s Release Plan: Youth A has a history of aggressive and destructive\nbehavior, self-harm and manipulation. He made improvements while in the\nprogram and returned to his parent’s home on 3/9/22.\n Behavior Management Philosophy and Procedures: Physical intervention can\nonly occur when there is a clear risk of impenitent harm. Emergency floor\nprocedures are no longer permitted, if a physical intervention ends up on the floor\nstaff must disengage the youth, help bring the youth to his knees or a standing\nposition, or utilize an escort position, in situations in which the previous 3 options\nare not viable youth can be moved to a supine position. Crisis Prevention\nInstitute: NVCI Training Materials: Interim control is a position in which two staff\nstand at each of the youth’s sides holding onto their arm with one hand and their\nshoulder with the other then the youth is bent forward, team control can also be\ndone in a kneeling position, and interim control is used with one staff member\nwho stands to the side of the youth holding one of the youth’s arms in front of the\nstaff and the other to the side. It also states, “…when a forcefully maintained\nposition hinders both chest and abdomen movement, the result can be fatal.”\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan\n(4) The written policy shall only permit the licensee to\nrestrain a child for the following circumstances:\n(a) To prevent injury to the child, self-injury, or injury to\nothers.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 restrained Youth A even though he was not trying to\ninjure anyone. Staff 1 admitted he misread the situation. The\nvideo showed Youth A was not posing a risk to anyone when he\nwas restrained. The restraint Staff 1 utilized on Youth A was not\nperformed in a safe manner. The video showed Staff 1\nstraddling Youth A with one knee on Youth A’s shoulder and\nholding Youth A’s jacket over his face.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2021C0214025, CAP accepted 11/10/21\n2021C0103033, CAP accepted 10/29/21\n2021C0214007 (previously cited as Rule 1(2)), CAP\naccepted 3/18/21\n6",
