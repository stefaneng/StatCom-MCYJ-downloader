There was\nno discipline noted and it was confirmed that he was\nproperly trained in the facility restraint model.\n• As of 12/14/2023 Staff 1 was placed on leave, and it was\nconfirmed on 12/27/2023 that this was indefinite pending\nthe outcome of the investigation.\n• An Incident Report dated 12/14/2023 was provided and\nreviewed. Sections were authored by Staff 1, Staff 4, Staff\n3 any, Staff 2 and the Chief Administrator. This\ndocumentation noted many similar elements to interviews\n5",
    "provided by staff. In the section authored by Staff 1 he\ndescribed putting his hands out in front of Youth A as Youth\nA approached him, only for Youth A to slip backwards.\nYouth A then got back up and threw several punches at\nStaff 1, and Staff 1 attempted to block these punches and\nwas hit once or twice in the face. Staff 1 then described\nbacking up towards the center of the room only for several\nother youth to then attempt to hit him.\n• Facility policy was reviewed titled “Emergency Restraint”\nand last revised as of August 2023. This policy outlines\nthat emergency restraints are only to be utilized when all\nother interventions are utilized but fail to protect youth or\nothers from aggressive behavior. There is not any\nlanguage in this policy that outlines specific behaviors or\nstrategies for staff when youth are attacking them.\n• Video footage of the incident was provided and viewed.\nThe footage began in the early evening of 12/14/2023.\nSeveral youths were sitting around the day room area with\nStaff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 4 in the room with them. At\n4:00:04 pm Youth C was seen getting up and taking a\ncomputer off of a nearby table, then walking over to the far\nwall and dropping it in the trash can. About 30 seconds\nlater, Staff 1 walks toward that trash can and Youth A\napproaches him quickly. Staff 1 put his hands out and\npushed Youth A backwards. Youth A did not fall to the\nground. Youth A then gathered himself and then re-\napproached Staff 1 and threw a punch with his right hand.\nStaff 1 then punched back with his right hand. A scuffle\nensued with both individuals’ hands on each other and\npushing, with Youth A throwing multiple punches at Staff 1.\nThis drifted to the far corner of the room where another\nyouth that cannot be distinguished picked up a chair and\nthrew it at Staff 1. Staff 1 ended up in the corner of the\nroom with several youth attacking him. He then was able to\nget away and, in an effort, to get to the back wall away from\nthe attacking youth, Staff 1 fell and was hit and kicked by\nseveral youth. Staff 2 can be seen attempting to block and\nrestrain youth away from attacking Staff 1. Staff 4 can be\nseen leaving the group and going into the control room.\nStaff 1 is eventually able to get into the control room and\naway from youth attempting to attack him. No concerns\nwere noted on how staff attempted to handle the escalated\nsituation after the initial part of it.\nDHHS Worker 1 had findings in their investigation and a staff\nmember was confirmed.\n6",
    "Analysis Through interviews with youth and staff, video footage and other\ndocumentation reviewed, there is evidence to show that Staff 1\npunched back at Youth A during an escalated incident and\ntherefore this rule was violated.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• It was discussed with the Chief Administrator that an\nincident of this magnitude should require significant\ndebriefing after the fact, including video review of staff\ninvolved for both negative and positive aspects of what\noccurred.\n• The facility is advised to revise their behavior management\npolicy for clarity to staff on what responses to physical\naggression from youth are acceptable and what are not.\nConsultation provided:\n• The facility is advised to have discussion and planning\nsurrounding how staff members can effectively team and\ncommunicate with each other while an escalated incident is\noccurring in order to produce the safest outcome for all\ninvolved.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n01/21/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/12/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n7",
