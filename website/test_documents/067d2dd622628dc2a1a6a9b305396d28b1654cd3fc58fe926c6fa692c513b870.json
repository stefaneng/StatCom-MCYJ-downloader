Staff 1\nreported there have been some issues at the facility since Staff 2\nwas hired as a team lead. Within the team lead role, that person\noversees how the shift is run. He reported on February 1, 2024, that\nthere were a lot of things going on within the unit, such as new\nintakes of youth and other youth requesting items. Staff 1 reported\none of the new youths was getting upset because they wanted to\nmake a phone call, but he did not have the appropriate items to allow\nthat to happen. He reported when Staff 2 came to the home, she\nasked him “Why did you do so many room checks at the fifteen-\nminute mark?” Staff 1 proceeded to explain to Staff 2 that he had\nbeen busy and was not able to adhere to varying interval checks not\n2",
    "exceeding fifteen minutes. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 told him, “Well go\nback and change the times since you were maintaining supervisor” to\nwhich Staff 1 declined as those checks were done at specific times\nsince the youth were in specific places at those moments and not in\nthe line of sight. Staff 1 reported he felt uncomfortable that Staff 2\ntold him to falsify the documentation. He reported he did not end up\nchanging his documentation. Staff 1 reported he had been told by\nStaff 4 that Staff 2 had also told him to falsify documentation.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 15,\n2024. Staff 2 reported she is a lead worker at the facility and her role\nis to make sure the shift runs smoothly, and everything is being done\ncorrectly. She reported one of her roles is to look over the\ndocumentation staff completes. Staff 2 reported staff maintains eyes\non supervision of the youth when they are not in bedrooms or\nbathroom. She stated staff document the eyes on supervision. Staff 2\nreported if a youth goes into their bedroom or bathroom, staff are to\nperform variable interval checks of the youth not to exceed fifteen\nminutes. She was asked if she ever asked staff to change their\ndocumentation or personally changed the documentation when it was\nnot correct. Staff 2 responded she would never do that. She asked\nwhy she would do that when she knows the cameras are always\nbeing viewed and that would be falsifying the documentation. She\nalso reported she has never asked a staff to change her\ndocumentation after her shift. When asked why someone would say\nthat she has, Staff 2 responded there was a day when she reviewed\nStaff 1’s documentation and asked him why he was doing room\nchecks every fifteen minutes instead of variable interval times, and\nStaff 1 told her because that is how it supposed to be done. She\nreported she talked with Supervisor about this situation and Staff 1\ntold Supervisor he asked her to change the times. Staff 2 reported\nshe never told him to change the times and told him in the future he\nneeds to do variable intervals checks.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n15, 2024. Supervisor reported Staff 2 spoke to him about the bed\ncheck logs to make sure it was being completed correctly. He\nreported Staff 2 stated she had spoken with Staff 1 about making\nsure it was being done correctly, meaning the room checks needed\nto be completed within variable intervals not to exceed fifteen\nminutes, and believed Staff 1 took it as her telling him to falsify the\ndocumentation. Supervisor reported he spoke with Staff 1 about the\nsituation as well and he reported Staff 2 was asking him to change\nthe documentation. Supervisor reported he believed it was a\nmisunderstanding. He reported he offered to set up a meeting\nbetween Staff 1 and Staff 2 about the situation and Staff 1 declined\nthe offer. Supervisor reported he does not have concerns of staff\nfalsifying documentation.\n3",
    "Staff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 15,\n2024. Staff 4 reported sometimes he covers team lead third shifts.\nHe reported about two weeks ago he came onto his shift and began\nto complete his room checks, which are noted to be variable intervals\nnot to exceed fifteen minutes. Staff 4 reported he received a phone\ncall from Staff 2 asking if he could look over her documentation of\nsafety checks she did the shift earlier. He reported when he reviewed\nit, he saw there was a half hour of no documentation, and she asked\nhim to write “remain in supervision.” Staff 4 reported he did not\nchange the documentation as he was not there and did not want to\nfalsify the documentation. He reported they are trained to document\nwhat they do and see.\nStaff 7 was interviewed via phone on March 18, 2024. Staff 7\nreported he has concerns about Staff 2 forging documentation at the\nfacility. He reported on March 9, 2024, the staff took all the youth on\nan outing and returned home around 7pm. Staff 7 reported at the end\nof the shift, Staff 8 showed the fifteen-minute check log and it\nappeared someone had forged Staff 8’s name on the checks. Staff 7\nreported Staff 8 told him; that Staff 2 had confronted her about her\nchecks not being done timely and when Staff 8 was ending her shift\nshe looked at the form and believed Staff 2 corrected it by using her\nname. Staff 7 does not believe Staff 2 has ever changed his\ndocumentation but notes he may just be unaware.\nStaff 8 was interviewed via phone on March 18, 2024. Staff 8\nreported she worked on March 9, 2024 and was in charge of the\ndocumentation for the checks of youth when they got back to the\nfacility around 7pm. She reported the checks are documented every\nfifteen minutes when you have eyes on the youth and in variable\nintervals when you are doing room checks. Staff 8 reported Staff 2\nreviewed her documentation and asked her to add a line in for a\ncheck. She reported she did not add in that line as requested\nbecause she did not do a check at that time. Staff 8 reported later in\nthe shift she looked at the documentation and saw there was a line\nwritten with her initials in it that she did not add. She reported this\nwas also not in her handwriting as she always writes in a bigger font\nwith the majority of uppercase letters whereas this line was in a\nsmaller font with lowercase letters. Staff 8 reported she believed it\nwas Staff 2 that did this as she was the one to talk to her about\nadding that line.\nStaff 10 was interviewed via phone on March 20, 2024. Staff 10\nreported she worked on March 9, 2024 and was completing interval\nchecks and documentation prior to Staff 8 completing them. She\nreported she was never told to falsify any of the times or her\ndocumentation. Staff 10 reported she would never sign someone\n4",
    "else’s initials to the paperwork even if she witnesses them doing the\nroom check. She reported it is on the staff that did the verification\ncheck to complete the documentation.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 15,\n2024. Staff 3 was asked about when checks need to be documented\non youth at the facility. He reported checks need to be always\ncompleted on the youth. Staff 3 reported if a youth goes into their\nroom or out of sight of staff then staff need to perform room checks in\nvariable intervals not exceeding fifteen minutes. He reported he was\nnever asked to change any of his documentation and has never seen\nsomeone change the documentation.\nStaff 5 and Staff 6 were separately interviewed face to face at\nthe facility on March 15, 2024. Staff 5 and Staff 6 reported they\nhave never been asked to falsify any documentation and denied\nevery falsifying documentation. They reported they have been trained\nto document every time they complete a fifteen-minute check or room\ncheck in variable intervals not exceeding fifteen minutes. Staff 5 and\nStaff 6 reported if they are to miss a room check in the time required,\nthey are to do a room check right away and not falsify the time.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n- Facility Daily Shift Log dated February 1, 2024 - Staff 1\nreported there was room checks he completed every fifteen\nminutes and was asked to change by Staff 2. When reviewing\nthe document Staff 1 wrote he completed bed checks at\n5:45pm, 6:00pm, 6:15pm, 6:30pm, 6:45pm and 7:00pm. The\nother bed checks he completed were done in variable\nintervals that did not exceed fifteen minutes.\n- Video Review House 1 on February 1, 2024 from 5:30pm\nto 7:00pm- Video footage was reviewed to compare the\ndocumentation on the Daily Shift Log to when Staff 1\ncompleted the room checks. When reviewing the video Staff 1\ncompleted room checks at 5:38pm, 5:48pm, 6:01-6:30pm,\n6:08pm, 6:17pm-6:18pm, 6:21pm, 6:23pm, 6:30pm, 6:34pm,\n6:42pm, 6:45pm, and 6:53pm. This was completed in\ncompliance with the rule for checking on youth when not in\ndirect eyesight. Staff 1 was also viewed in the video to be\ncompleting intake paperwork for new youth coming to the\nfacility which may have led to him not documenting the correct\ntimes on the Daily Shift Log.\n- Facility Daily Shift Log dated February 24, 2024- Staff 4\nreported when he was working third shift, he was asked by\nStaff 2 to check if there was any time missing within the Daily\nShift Log. He reported there was a half hour of time missing,\n5",
    "and Staff 2 asked him to correct it. When reviewing the\nphysical Daily Shift Log from February 24, 2024, there was\nchecks completed at 4:33pm, 5:00pm, 6:20pm, and 6:50pm\nthat fit the concern Staff 4 mentioned. It is noted on the sheet\nthat the youth were outside and on a van trip during that time\nwhich remained in direct supervision of staff.\n- Facility Daily Shift Log dated March 9, 2024- Staff 8\nreported concerns of someone writing in her signature on the\nshift log for 03/09/2024. When reviewing the documentation,\nthe check that is at 7:53pm has the initials of Staff 8\ncompleting but the handwriting does look different than the\nother checks Staff 8 documented at 8:07pm, 8:17pm, and\n8:30pm. Staff 10 and Staff 2 completed the Daily Shift Log\nchecks prior to the 7:53pm check.\n- Video Review House 1 on March 9, 2024 from 7:45pm to\n8:30pm- Staff 8 is observed completing the check at 7:53pm\nwhich is consistent with the Daily Shift Log, even though there\nis concern that the handwriting is not similar. Within the video,\nStaff 8 is seen writing on paperwork. Staff 8 also completed\nthe checks at 8:07pm, 08:17pm, and 8:30pm which is\nconsistent with the Daily Shift Log.\n- Facility Policy and Procedure for Supervision of Minors in\nResidential Placement dated July 2022- This policy notes it\nis not acceptable to record or sign off on a check if it was not\ncompleted or before it has been completed. The facility notes\nthis as falsified documentation and could lead to termination\nof employment.\n- Staff 2’s Human Resource File- On February 7, 2024,\nSupervisor spoke with Staff 2 about the reported concerns of\nfalsifying documentation. Staff 2 reported to Supervisor she\nwould have never told staff to change the documentation, only\nthat staff should in the future stagger the checks and not\nperform them at exactly 15 minutes. There were no\ndisciplinary actions taken from that meeting. Staff 2 is up to\ndate on all required trainings. She was trained on\ndocumentation requirements on November 16, 2023.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as Staff 1 falsified the\ndaily shift log noting he performed checks every minute opposed\nto the time he actually completed the checks as observed on\nvideo.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTechnical assistance was offered to ensure the daily shift log and\nsupervision policy don’t contradict. The daily shift log states\n6",
    "throughout each shift staff are to complete varying interval checks\nnot to exceed fifteen minutes, whereas the policy states\nthroughout each shift staff are to complete fifteen minute checks.\nConsultation:\nConsultation was offered to consider the documentation\nrequirements when youth are within the direct supervision of staff.\nCurrently staff are made to document every fifteen minutes for\neach youth even if they are sitting next to the youth for a long\nperiod of time which impacts the staff’s ability to engage with\nyouth.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Staff to resident ratio\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127\nSection (1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-to-child\nDescription ratio formula for direct care workers. If a child caring institution is\ncontracted by the department to care for youth, the facility will\nfollow its contracted ratio.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency was out of ratio on at least two occasions.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplaint Source was interviewed via phone on March 14, 2024\nand had no further complaints.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on March 14, 2024. Staff 1\nreported on February 15, 2024 around 10:45pm, Staff 2 came onto\nthe unit and gave the directions for staff to step out of ratio to help\nher take the recycling out. He reported there were either ten or\neleven youths on the unit at the time when he and Staff 3 were\nworking. Staff 1 reported the ratio is one staff to every eight youth, so\ncompleting the task Staff 2 told them to do would put them out of the\nratio. He reported Staff 3 did follow the direction of Staff 2 because\nshe would have reprimanded him. Staff 1 reported he was left out of\nthe ratio for a bit of time. Staff 1 reported on February 21, 2024\naround 5pm, Staff 2 was working with him on shift. He reported Staff\n2 left the house both days which left him to be out of ratio with the\nyouth. Staff 1 reported it was told to him it would be fine because\nSupervisor was asking for Staff 2 to come to another home.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 15,\n2024. Staff 2 reported that being a lead worker gives her the ability to\nfloat between the houses to help where there is a need. She reported\nthe ratio during the awake hours is one staff to every eight youth and\n7",
    "during sleeping hours the ratio is one staff to every twelve youth. She\nreported each house during awake hours is staffed with two staff and\nwhen they need a filler within the ratio, she will fill in. She stated on\nweeknights youth go to bed around 9:30pm and on weekends they\ngo to bed around 10:30pm. Staff 2 reported she remembers only one\ntime, but could not recall the specific date, where a staff had called\noff last minute. She had to fill in as the staff to meet ratio while\nSupervisor worked on getting another staff to come in. Staff 2\nreported she never asked to have staff step out of ratio or told them it\nwould be all right to be out of ratio for a few moments. When asked\nabout the recycling incident she reported she never asked for Staff 3\nto step out of ratio since the youth were all sleeping, and Staff 1\nwould be in ratio in the home.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 15,\n2024. Staff 3 reported the ratio at the facility when the youth are\nawake is one staff to every eight youth. He reported he does not\nknow the nighttime ratio. Staff 3 reported there was one occasion\nwhen he was asked by Staff 2 to step out of ratio. He reported he\nwas working with Staff 1, and they had eleven youth within the home,\nso they were in the exact ratio. Staff 3 reported Staff 2 came over\nand asked for Staff 3 to help her take out the recycling and he\nreported he did because he did not want to get in trouble since Staff\n2 is a team lead. He reported he knew he left Staff 2 out of ratio\nwithin the home for about fifteen minutes. Staff 3 reported at the time\nthey took out the recycling all the youth were sleeping in their room.\nHe reported himself and Staff 1 told Staff 2 that they would be out of\nratio, but she did not care.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on March\n15, 2024. Supervisor reported the concern of Staff 2 asking Staff 1\nand Staff 3 to be out of ratio to take out of the recycling. He reported\nthe time this occurred was when all the youth were already in their\nrooms sleeping. Supervisor reported the ratio at night is one staff to\ntwelve youth which meant the staff would have been in ratio if one of\nthe staff stepped out. He also reported the other incidents where\nStaff 2 left the home to help him he reported the home was still in\nratio because the Assistant Supervisor was in the home. Supervisor\nreported staff sometimes get confused that he and the Assistant\nSupervisor can count in as ratio when needed. He reported Staff 2 is\nthe team lead and oversees running the shift when she works.\nSupervisor reported he sets up the schedule so there are always two\nstaff working in each house and the team lead is not counted in ratio\nso if there is a situation where a staff is out of ratio the team lead can\nbe counted in where support is needed.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 15,\n2024. Staff 4 reported the ratio at the facility is one staff to eight\n8",

Staff 4 reported on March 8, 2024, he\nwas working with Staff 1 at one of the houses. He reported he\nreceived a call from Staff 2 to come help with something and he told\nher he could not leave the house as that would leave Staff 1 out of\nratio. Staff 4 reported she tried to tell him it would be only for a few\nmoments and refused to do so as he did not want Staff 1 to be out of\nratio. He reported there was another time when he brought youth\ndownstairs with Staff 2 to play games. Staff 4 reported she left him\nout of ratio for ten to fifteen minutes and when he tried to address it\nwith her, she told him she was the lead worker, and it was fine.\nStaff 7 was interviewed via phone on March 18, 2024.

He reported after a bit\nof time, Staff 2 came up the stairs and sat down on her computer to\ndo some paperwork. Staff 7 reported after about ten or fifteen\nminutes he asked Staff 2 who was downstairs with Staff 9. He stated\nshe reported Staff 9 was in ratio down there and Staff 7 responded\nno she was not as she had nine youth downstairs with her. Staff 7\nreported Staff 2 went back downstairs and asked him to not say\nanything. He reported he has heard from other staff that Staff 2 has\nasked them to be out ratio multiple times.\nStaff 9 was interviewed via phone on March 20, 2024. Staff 9\nreported she worked on March 15, 2024 with Staff 7. She stated on\nthat day she remembers she was going to take eight youth\ndownstairs to play video games and the three other boys were going\nto stay upstairs with Staff 7. Staff 9 reported that nine boys ended up\nwanting to come downstairs, so it was planned for Staff 2 to come\ndownstairs so they would be within ratio requirements. She reported\nStaff 2 came over to be downstairs for a bit and she then went\nupstairs for about ten minutes which left Staff 9 out of ratio. Staff 9\nreported she did not know why Staff 2 left her, but it did occur.\nStaff 5 and Staff 6 were separately interviewed face to face at\nthe facility on March 15, 2024. Staff 5 and Staff 6 reported the ratio\nat the facility is one staff member to every eight youth. They reported\nthere are two staff working every shift as there are typically more\nthan eight youth living at the home at any given time.

    "summary": "A state investigation of the Samaritas Shelter in Grand Rapids substantiated two violations: a staff member falsified bed check times on daily logs, and the facility was out of state-mandated staff-to-youth ratio on multiple occasions, with a team lead directing or allowing these ratio breaches. The report concludes that Staff 2, the team lead, bears significant responsibility for the violations, having instructed staff to falsify documentation and having created or permitted multiple instances of being out of ratio.",
