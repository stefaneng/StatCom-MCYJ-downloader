Youth A said on December 2, 2023, another\nyouth in his house was “going off” and one of the staff called\nSupervisor to assist with the situation because the staff thought\nYouth A was going to “jump” the other youth. Youth A said\nSupervisor arrived at the house and told him to either clean the\nhouse or sit at the table to which he responded that he did not\nwant to, and Supervisor could not make him if he was “outside,\nout of bounds”. Youth A said he sat in the dining room and put on\nhis shoes and started to walk to the door however Supervisor was\nstanding by the door, so he turned to start going down the stairs to\nthe basement. Youth A said once he began walking down the\nstairs, Supervisor “grabbed the hood” of his sweatshirt and\n“pulled” him outside.
