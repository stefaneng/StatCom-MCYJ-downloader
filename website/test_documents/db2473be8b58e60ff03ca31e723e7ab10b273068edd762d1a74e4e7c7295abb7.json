INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10169 Discipline\nSection (1) A facility shall have and follow written policy and procedure\nDescription which stipulates that residents shall not be subjected to any of the\nfollowing: (a) Corporal or cruel punishment.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 5/5/23, a staff member engaged in a physical altercation with a\nyouth at the facility. Staff member chased youth and put youth into\na headlock.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Administrator 2 was interviewed face to face at\nthe facility on 5/9/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker.\nAdministrator 2 was not present or working at the time of the\nincident. However, she interviewed all four youth and Staff 2 about\nthe incident on 5/8/23. Administrator 2 reported the camera\nsystem does not consistently record any longer, so Supervisor 1\nused her phone to record the video from the monitoring system.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/9/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported everyone\nin the pod was playing around most of the day. After Youth A got\nout of the shower, he saw Youth C messing around with Staff 1.\nStaff 1 got up from the chair and Youth C fell backwards. Youth A\nthought when Youth C feel it was because Staff 1 pushed him, so\nYouth A went to the side of Staff 1, tapped his face, and kept\njogging forward. Youth A reported as he was jogging forward,\nStaff 1 threw a Nintendo Switch remote at him, it hit the wall, and it\nshattered. Youth A reported Staff 1 began chasing him around the\npod area and finally caught up with him. Youth A reported Staff 1\nput his arm around Youth A’s neck, and he did not feel pressure\nbecause he had so much adrenaline, but he heard from the other\nyouth his face was turning red. When Staff 1 had his arm around\nYouth A’s neck, Staff 1 stated “I told you to stop playing with me”\nover and over. Youth A stated when other staff entered the room,\nthey immediately began grabbing Youth A's legs because they\nthought Youth A was in the wrong. After the other staff restrained\nhim, Staff 1 walked away. When the other staff found out Youth A\nwas not in the wrong, they guided him to his room, and he\nreceived a punishment for 24 hours of room time. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 plays around with them physically often, so Youth\nA was shocked it became serious and Staff 1 took it so far. Youth\nA reported Staff 1 frequently says things like “shut the fuck up or\nyou’ll go to your room” or “shut the fuck up or I’ll beat your ass”.\n2",
    "Youth A reported he has never reported it before because he\nnever took Staff 1 seriously.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported after he\nand the other youth came back from the student commons, the\nyouth took turns to completing their showers while other youth\nplayed video games with staff. Youth B reported Youth A got out\nof the shower and was in a very playful mood. Youth B reported\nwhile he, Staff 1, Staff 2, and Youth C were playing video games,\nYouth A began trying to roughhouse with Staff 1. Staff 1 asked\nYouth A to stop playing around. Shortly after, Youth C also joined\nin trying to play around with Staff 1. Youth B stated Youth A said,\n“I can fight anyone” and continued to try to roughhouse with Staff\n1. Youth B reported Staff 1 continued to ask them to stop. Youth B\nreported he also told the other youth to chill out and stop so they\ndid not get in trouble for horseplay. Youth C tapped Staff 1, Staff 1\nstood up from his chair, and Youth C fell backwards. Youth A then\ntapped Staff 1 on the face and Staff 1 got mad. Staff 1 then went\nafter Youth A and told Youth A he was playing too much. Staff 1\nthrew a Nintendo Switch remote at Youth A, but it hit the wall\ninstead. At first, Youth B thought they were playing around, but\nthen when he got up, he saw Staff 1 was choking Youth A by\nholding one arm around his neck and having his other hand at\nYouth A’s throat. Youth B reported Staff 1’s face was red, and his\nveins were popping out of his neck, so it was obvious he was\nangry. Youth B reported Youth A’s face was also red when Staff 1\nwas holding him in a headlock. Youth B reported when he saw\nhow serious it was, he grabbed Staff 1 around his waist and tried\npulling him off Youth A. While he was trying to pull him off, Youth\nB said he told Staff 1 to chill out because it was not serious. Youth\nB said after the incident, Youth A told Staff 1 “I got something for\nyou when I get out” and was cussing at him. Youth B said Staff 1\nthen told Youth A “careful what you wish for and careful what\nyou’re saying because there are microphones on the wall”.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth C reported he,\nYouth B, Staff 1, and Staff 2 were playing video games when\nYouth A got out of the shower and was trying to horseplay with\nStaff 1. Youth C reported Youth A ran up to Staff 1 and tapped\nhim. Youth C reported Staff 1 then chased Youth A to the\nwhiteboard at the end of the room. Staff 1 repeated “stop playing”\nto them but didn’t give any consequences for what would happen\nif they would stop so they didn’t take Staff 1 seriously. Youth C\nreported he then tapped Staff 1’s arm. When Staff 1 stood up,\n3",
    "Youth C reported he fell backwards because he did not expect\nStaff 1 to stand up. Youth A then tapped Staff 1 on his face and\nran away. Staff 1 started running after Youth A and threw the\nNintendo Switch remote at Youth A, but it hit the wall instead.\nYouth B reported when Staff 1 caught Youth A, Staff 1 started\nchoking Youth A with his arm around his neck so that’s how the\nother youth knew things were serious. Youth C reported Youth A's\nface was red and his veins were popping out on his face. Youth C\nreported Youth A was not fighting against Staff 1 or being\naggressive towards Staff 1 at all. Youth C reported he and Youth\nB told Staff 1 “chill out! It’s not that serious”, but he wouldn’t\nrelease Youth A. Youth C reported he grabbed Staff 1’s arm and\nYouth B grabbed Staff 1 around his waist to try and get him off\nYouth A. Youth C reported he then yelled at Staff 2 to come help\nbecause he was still sitting down where they were playing video\ngames. Staff 1 came to their rooms later that night and Youth C\nreported he asked Staff 1 what happened. Youth C reported Staff\n1 responded he blacked out. Youth C reported Youth A was really\nupset because he was serving a room time punishment after Staff\n1 became too physical with him, so he was yelling and cussing at\nStaff 1. Youth C reported Staff 1 told Youth A “everyone has\naccess to a 9 mm gun”. Youth C reported this is not the first time\nthey have horse played with Staff 1, but this is the first time it has\ngotten serious. Youth C reported Staff 1 has frequently told the\nyouth “I’ll beat your ass”, but they took it as Staff 1 playing around.\nYouth C reported Staff 1 is too comfortable with the youth in his\nposition and frequently cusses at them and calls them profane\nnames like “hoes”.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported on 5/5/23,\nhe was working on A-Pod. Staff 1 said earlier in the day, Youth C\ntried to play fight with him in the student commons and Staff 1 told\nYouth C to back off, but he did not give Youth C room time\nconsequently like he should have. Staff 1 reported Youth C was\ntrying to goof off and he knows Youth C wasn’t trying to make it a\nserious situation or provoke him. Staff 1 said he should not give so\nmany chances to Youth C, but he did, and he regretted it. Staff 1\nsaid everyone went back to the pod and the youth started taking\nshowers. Staff 1, Staff 2, Youth B and Youth C were playing video\ngames on the Nintendo Switch in the common area of the pod.\nStaff 1 said Youth A took his shower first and when he got out of\nthe shower, he said he could beat Staff 1 up in a playful manner.\nStaff 1 said he knew Youth A was playing around and wasn’t\nserious, so Staff 1 replied “I’m not doing that with you [Youth A]”.\nAfter Staff 1 replied to Youth A, Youth A began to instigate Youth\n4",
    "C to start playing around with Staff 1 too, so then both youths\nwere picking at him. Staff 1 reported Youth C kept pausing the\nvideo game and Staff 1 asked Youth C to chill out because they\nwere just supposed to be having a fun, relaxing day. Staff 1\nreported he told the youth about 8 times to stop, and he wasn’t\nplaying around anymore, but they wouldn’t stop. Youth D touched\nStaff 1’s face and Youth B told Youth D to stop, so Youth D\nstopped immediately. Staff 1 reported Youth A kept escalating the\nsituation by continuing to touch him and encourage Youth C to do\nthe same. Staff 1 reported Youth C came up to him and Staff 1\naccidently stepped on Youth C’s foot while he was trying to stand\nup, so Youth C fell backwards, and Staff 1 was standing over him.\nStaff 1 said Youth A came around his side and tapped Staff 1 on\nhis face and ran forward. Staff 1 reported given Youth B and\nYouth C’s histories of violence, Staff 1 went into defense mode\nand his mind flipped. Staff 1 reported as Youth A ran, Staff 1 threw\nthe Nintendo Switch video game controller at Youth A and he\nreported his intention was to hit Youth A because he was mad.\nThe controller ended up hitting the wall, and then Staff 1 said he\nwent up to Youth A and said “I told you I was not playing with you.\nHow many times do I have to say that?” Staff 1 reported Youth A\nwas laughing. Staff 1 reported he was in a defensive position with\nYouth A in front of him and Youth C behind him. Staff 1 reported\nbased on their violent histories, Staff 1 wasn’t sure what was\ngoing to happened. Staff 1 reported he leaned over Youth A and\nheld his arm around Youth A’s neck to hold him in a control hold\nposition, which he learned in his martial arts Jujitsu training. Staff\n1 reported he was sure not to put pressure on Youth A’s neck,\nchoke him or hurt him and made sure he was breathing the whole\ntime. Staff 1 referred to the situation with Youth A as “one-on-one\ncombat”. Staff 1 reported he then heard someone else call a Level\n1 emergency on the radio, which caused him to feel more relaxed\nand relieved because he was going to receive help. Staff 1 stated\nhe didn’t want to let go of Youth A because, in his experience, if a\nstaff member lets go too soon, a youth will beat up or attack a staff\nmember when they’re mad. Staff 1 reported he held onto Youth A\nuntil other staff arrived and restrained Youth A. Staff 1 reported he\nleft the room after Youth A was restrained and doesn’t know what\nhappened after he left. Staff 1 reported later in the night, he went\nto the hallway outside the youths’ bedrooms to talk to Youth A.\nStaff 1 stated Youth A threatened him by saying “just wait until\nSeptember when I get out. I know your work hours and I’ll pop\nyou”. Staff 1 reported Youth C was trying to talk to him because\nhe thought he was in trouble for what happened, and even during\nthe conversation with Youth C, Youth A was trying to instigate and\nescalate things. Staff 1 reported he told Youth A “at the end of the\n5",
    "day, you have the freedom to do anything you want when you get\nout” and then walked away. Staff 1 reported he made a mistake by\nnot calling for back-up as he should have called a supervisor since\nit continued to escalate, and the youth wouldn’t stop. Staff 1 stated\nhe never asked Staff 2 to call for back up or help, which he also\nshould have done. Staff 1 stated Staff 2 was brand new, and he\ndidn’t feel he could trust him to help in the situation. Staff 1\nreported if there was a veteran employee with him on staff, he felt\nthe situation would have gone differently. Staff 1 admitted he was\ndefensive in his reactions but kept trying to de-escalate the\nsituation by asking the youth to stop instead of issuing\nconsequences. Staff 1 reported nothing like this has ever\nhappened before and he’s never felt as angry. Staff 1 reported he\nhas always been calm when doing restraints and having\ninteractions with youth in the past. Staff 1 reported he felt he\ncouldn’t utilize CPI restraint training during the incident because\nhe wasn’t sure what the youth were trying to do, and he was very\ndefensive.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported he has\nbeen working at the facility for approximately 2 months. Staff 2\nreported on 5/5/23, he was assigned to all of the pods at the\nfacility as a floater to help out and do visual 15-minute checks on\nthe youth. Staff 2 reported he was hanging out on A-pod and\nplaying video games with Staff 1, Youth B and Youth C until he\nhad to complete his next set of checks. Staff 2 reported Youth C\nbegan poking at Staff 1’s face and Staff 2 couldn’t tell if Youth C\nwas messing around or not. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 told Youth C\nto stop playing around, but he wouldn’t stop. Staff 2 reported Staff\n1 asked the youth to stop playing and messing around 4-5 times,\nbut they wouldn’t stop. Staff 2 reported Youth A then tapped or\ntouched Staff 1’s face and Staff 1 took it seriously. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 threw the video game controller at Youth A, but Staff 2\ncouldn’t tell if it was out of frustration or anger. Staff 2 reported he\ncontinued to sit in the video game area and couldn’t see\neverything happening behind the white board when Staff 1 and\nYouth A were across the room. Staff 2 reported he could not tell if\nthey were playing around or if it was serious, so he didn’t do\nanything to stop the situation or get involved. Staff 2 reported he\nthen saw Staff 1’s restraint hold with his arm around Youth A’s\nneck/shoulders, so Staff 2 felt things became more serious. Staff 2\nreported he was overthinking everything and wasn’t sure what to\ndo in the situation, so he didn’t call for help or get up until the last\nminute. Staff 2 reported by the time he got up, other staff were\nalready coming into the room. Staff 2 stated after the incident\n6",
    "occurred, he helped put the youth in their rooms and wrote his\nincident report. Staff 2 reported he has never seen Staff 1 react\nlike that or interact with a youth at the facility like that before. Staff\n2 reported Staff 1 appeared calm during the situation and did not\nappear angry.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 heard a Level 1 call\non the radio and reported to A-pod immediately. When he entered\nthe pod, Staff 1 had Youth A in a control position in the chair. Staff\n3 described Staff 1’s chest up against Youth A’s chest, with Staff\n1’s head over Youth A’s left shoulder and Youth A’s arms up in the\nair. Staff 1 reported this was not a CPI approved restraint\ntechnique or anything they are taught at the facility. Staff 3\nreported he went to assist Staff 1 because it looked like Staff 1\nwas the only employee in the room. He reported he later found out\nStaff 2 was also in the room, but he initially thought Staff 2 was a\nyouth. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 told Youth A “I’m about to let you\ngo. Don’t hit me”. Staff 3 reported he could tell Staff 1 was fired up\nbecause his ears were all red, but Staff 1 was not yelling and\nappeared to have control of himself. Staff 3 reported once he and\nStaff 4 were helping with Youth A, Staff 1 got up and left the pod.\nStaff 3 reported Youth A was not aggressive or fighting against\nthem and he went to his room without issue.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 reported he heard\nthe Level 1 call, so he reported immediately. When he entered the\nroom, Staff 1 had Youth A in a headlock in the corner. Staff 4\nreported Youth A was laughing at the time, so Staff 4 could not tell\nwhat was going on or what happened prior to cause Youth A’s\nreaction. Staff 4 reported he asked Staff 2 to put the other youth in\ntheir rooms. Staff 4 reported he and Staff 3 each held down one of\nYouth A’s arms. Youth A told them “I was just playing around, but\n[Staff 1] took it too far. You can let me go”. Staff 4 reported Staff 1\ndidn’t respond or say anything. Staff 4 was focused on Youth A,\nso he isn’t sure if Staff 1 left on his own or if someone told him to\nleave. Staff 4 reported he was focused on Youth A’s demeanor, so\nhe did not notice Staff 1’s demeanor. Staff 4 reported Youth A’s\nbody was tense, but he was not being aggressive or trying to fight\nagainst them. Staff 4 said he and Staff 3 then escorted Youth A to\nhis room.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/10/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 5 heard the Level 1\ncall, so she reported to A-Pod immediately. When she walked\n7",
    "onto the pod, Staff 1, Staff 3, Staff 4, and Supervisor 1 were\nalready present. Staff 3 and Staff 4 were holding Youth A down.\nStaff 5 reported Staff 1 was very upset and kept repeating “you\ndon’t do that” speaking to Youth A, but she isn’t sure what Staff 1\nwas referring to. Staff 5 reported Staff 1 said he needed a minute\nto breathe, and then he left the area.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n5/10/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 1\nreported at 7:30 pm on 5/5/23 an employee on another pod called\na Level 1 notification on the radio for A-pod so she responded to\nA-pod for assistance. When she arrived, Staff 1, Staff 3 and Staff\n4 had Youth A restrained. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A was\nsitting on the couch while Staff 3 and Staff 4 were each holding\none of his arms on the couch, so Supervisor 1 went to restrain his\nankles. She reported she was not sure what happened prior, but\nStaff 1 was cussing and angry. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 said\nsomething to the extent of “you’ve got the wrong damn staff”\ntowards Youth A. Supervisor 1 reported she did not hear anything\nelse he said clearly. Supervisor 1 stated Youth A was not being\naggressive or trying to fight against staff, but his body was very\ntense. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A also wasn’t saying anything\ninappropriate towards staff. Supervisor 1 reported she asked for\nanother staff to have Staff 1 leave the area because after he\nwalked away from Youth A, he was too far away for Supervisor 1\nto give the directive. Two minutes after Staff 1 left the room, Youth\nA became less tense and asked if he could go to his room, so\nStaff 3 and Staff 4 led him to his room using a 2 person CPI hold.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A went willingly to his room without\nany issues. After the incident, Supervisor 1 went to the video\ncameras to try and see what happened prior to the Level 1\nnotification call because the camera system is not working or\nrecording videos properly. Supervisor 1 said thankfully she was\nable to rewind enough to get most of the incident pulled up, so she\nrecorded it on her phone for documentation. Supervisor 1 reported\nshe has seen Staff 1 become angry and upset before, but she has\nnever seen him go after a youth or try and hurt a youth.\nSupervisor 1 reported when Staff 1 gets upset, it is very difficult to\ncalm him down. Supervisor 1 reported the restraint Staff 1\ncompleted on Youth A prior to other staff arriving was not CPI\napproved and was not something they are taught to do at the\nfacility. Supervisor 1 reported it was late at night when she got\ndone collecting everything regarding the incident, so she chose to\nwait until the next day to report it to Administrator 2 rather than\ntrusting her gut and calling him the same night.\n8",
    "Supervisor 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n5/10/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 2 was\nthe dayshift supervisor on 5/6/23. Supervisor 2 reported\nSupervisor 1 told him about the incident during the shift change\ndebrief. Supervisor 1 told Supervisor 2 she hadn’t informed\nAdministrator 2 yet because by the time she finished all the\npaperwork, it was late at night. Supervisor 2 instructed Supervisor\n1 to text Administrator 2 to let him know she needed to speak to\nhim as soon as possible and Supervisor 1 agreed. Supervisor 2\nreported Administrator 2 called to check on everything at the\nfacility around 1 pm on 5/6/23, so Supervisor 2 informed\nAdministrator 2 what happened the previous night. Supervisor 2\ntold Administrator 2 Staff 1 was on shift as the floater, but he did\nnot allow him to work on A-Pod due to the incident the previous\nnight. Administrator 2 stated Staff 1 needed to be put on\nsuspended leave and punch out, so Supervisor 2 let Staff 1 know\nand escorted him out of the building. Supervisor 2 reported Staff 1\ndid not argue and stated he was going to be honest because he\nwished he’d handled things differently.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n5/9/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Administrator 2\nreported the incident occurred on 5/5/23, but he wasn’t called after\nit occurred, which should have happened because he is always on\ncall. He reported Supervisor 2 made him aware of the incident on\n5/6/23 when he called up to the facility to see how things were\ngoing. Administrator 2 reported Supervisor 2 told him what\nhappened the previous night and notified him Staff 1 was currently\non shift but was not with the same pod of youth. Administrator 2\ninstructed Supervisor 2 to escort Staff 1 out of the building and let\nStaff 1 know he was on unpaid leave until further investigation\noccurred.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo Footage from the A-pod commons dated 5/5/23 was\nreviewed. There is no audio. Staff 1, Staff 2, and Youth C are all\nviewed to be sitting in chairs and Youth D is standing behind them\nwhen Youth A enters the room. Youth C stands up and jumps\ntowards Staff 1, while Youth A is behind Staff 1. Youth B was\nhidden by the rolling white board but stands up and is to the front-\nright of Staff 1. After Youth B stands up, Youth C sits back down in\nhis chair. Youth A is still located behind Staff 1. Youth B lowers\nback down to the ground behind the rolling white board again.\nYouth D comes into frame and stands next to Staff 2. Youth D and\nYouth A both put their hands next to or on Staff 1’s face. It is\nunknown from the video whether either youth makes physical\n9",
    "contact with Staff 1. Youth D then backs away. Staff 1 gets up\nfrom his seat, turns around and pushes Youth A backwards. Youth\nA then runs around the tables. Youth C gets up from his chair and\napproaches Staff 1 and puts his hand towards him. It is unknown\nwhether he makes physical contact with Staff 1. Staff 1 steps\nforward and Youth C falls backwards onto the ground. Youth A is\nstill by the tables which is to the back-right of Staff 1. Youth A then\ngoes around the table, approaches Staff 1, touches Staff 1’s face\nwith his hand and runs forward towards the wall. Youth B gets up\nfrom the floor and is standing, while Youth C is still on the floor on\nhis back in front of Staff 1. Staff 1 throws an object at Youth A, but\nit does not hit Youth A. Then Staff 1 steps over Youth C and goes\nafter Youth A. Staff 2 remained seated in the chair during the\nentire course of events thus far. Youth A switches his direction,\nruns to the right, behind the rolling white board, and Staff 1 chases\nafter him. Staff 1 then pins Youth A against the wall/windows and\nputs his arm around Youth A’s neck, while his face is directly in\nYouth A’s face. Youth A’s right arm is around Staff 1’s back. Youth\nB stands up and walks towards Staff 1 and Youth A to watch.\nYouth C gets up from the floor and sits down in a chair watching\nStaff 1 and Youth A. Youth D stands behind Youth C and watches\nthe interaction between Youth A and Staff 1. Youth A uses his\nhands to attempt to pull Staff 1’s body off him, but Staff 1 does not\nlet go right away. After a few seconds, Staff 1 releases his arm\nfrom around Youth A’s neck. Staff 1 and Youth A have their arms\nand hands interlocked and are pushing each other. Then Staff 1\nreaches his arm around Youth A’s neck again and Youth A’s arm\nis around Staff 1’s back. Staff 2 remains seated in his chair and\ndoesn’t physically check on anything occurring on the other side of\nthe room. Youth C remains sitting in a chair, while Youth B and\nYouth D are watching Staff 1 and Youth A’s interactions.

Staff 1 and Youth A\ngo into the corner, out of camera view. Once Staff 1 and Youth A\nare in the corner, Youth C and Staff 2 get out of their chairs and\napproach the situation. Youth B, Youth C and Staff 2 are all seen\nbent over, but it is unknown what they are doing or what position\nStaff 1 and Youth A are in because it is outside of the camera’s\nview.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident Report dated 5/5/23 written by Staff 1 gives Staff\n1’s account about what happened prior to and during his\naltercation with Youth A. It is somewhat consistent with\n10",
    "Staff 1’s interview.
