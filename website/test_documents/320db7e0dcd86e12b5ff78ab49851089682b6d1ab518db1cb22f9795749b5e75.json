    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency is not following the visitation plan. The caregiver\narrives late for scheduled parenting times, and the agency does\nnot extend the visitation for the parent and child.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nBirthmother\nOn 4/3/2025 I interviewed Birthmother by telephone about the\nallegations. Birthmother reported her son has been placed with\nthis agency since 1/7/2025. She reported she visits with her\nchildren two times per week at the agency generally from 3:00pm\nuntil 4:00pm. She reported the foster parents for Child A have\nbeen late for her parent/child visits at least six times. The foster\nparents’ lateness for the visits have ranged between 10 minutes to\n40 minutes. The lateness of 40 minutes occurred one time; and\nmost lateness ranged between 10 minutes to about 15 minutes.\nBirthmother reported she has requested her visits be extended the\namount of time the foster parents have been late, but this has not\nalways occurred. The agency has only made up at least 25\nminutes of late time and that was with respect to the time the\nfoster parents were 45 minutes late for a visit.\nBirthmother reported speaking with Foster Care Worker (FCW)\nabout the foster parents being late; the visits being extended on\n1/16/2025 and most recently on 3/19/2025. She reported being\ntold by FCW that on occasions, the foster parents have not always\nbeen late. That the foster parents/the child has been waiting in\nthe lobby, and by the time it has taken staff to retrieve Child A\nand get him to the parent/child visitation area, the 10 or 15\nminutes has transpired. Birthmother reported FCW does not\nalways supervise the parenting times and is relying on what others\nhave reported to her. Birthmother admitted she had discussed\nfoster parents lateness at the one FTM that has occurred; but the\nfoster parents were not involved, and she did not think they were\nto be present for that. She does not believe anything has been\ndone to rectify making up for the several minutes that the foster\nparents have been late. She has not spoken with a supervisor\nabout her concern. She did not know whether the agency has\nasked the foster parents to stay over during the time they were\nlate; and the foster parents refused or were unable to do so. She\nstated the agency has never talked about what they would do if\nthe foster parents are late. The agency has only stressed the\nimportance of her being on time for the visits.\nChief Administrator\n2",
    "I had an email correspondence with Chief Administrator (CA)\nabout the allegations on 4/4/2025. CA reported awareness of the\nallegation and reported a special evaluation was being conducted\nwith the foster parents, Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2\npertaining to this issue.\nFoster Care Worker\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 4/11/2025. FCW reported the agency received\nresponsibility for Birthmother and Child A’s, (an infant) case in\nJanuary of this year. She reported that the visitation plan set for\nBirthmother is for Birthmother to receive two hours of visitation\ntwice per week. She reported the day of the week of\nBirthmother’s visits varies due to Birthmother’s work schedule, but\nthe visits are normally during business hours. She reported there\nare two children connected to the case; Child A whom Birthmother\nhas noted a concern about the foster parents; and Child B who is\nplaced with Child’ B’ father. FCW admitted there has been times\nthat Child A’s foster parents have been 10-15 minutes late for the\nparent child visits; and on one occasion it was 45 minutes late.\nFCW reported the one 45 minutes lateness was due to the foster\nparents’ confusion about whether the visit was scheduled. As for\nthe times the foster parents were 10-15 minutes late, FCW was\nnot sure of the number of visits that occurred on, or whether those\nwere actually lateness by the foster parents or due to the foster\nparents arriving timely and it taking a number of minutes to get the\nchild from the lobby to the visitation areas.\nFCW reported it is the agency’s policy to extend visitation times\nwhen foster parents are late. She reported visits are supervised by\na family support worker mostly, so she was not initially aware of\nthis issue. She reported one of Birthmother’s visits was extended\n25 minutes following the time the foster parents were 40 minutes\nlate. Making up the other 15 minutes from that visit and making up\nfor the times the foster parents were supposably 10-15 minutes\nlate is in the works to be made up. FCW reported she had a\ndiscussion with the foster parents about this when it was brought\nto her attention by Birthmother in March; and her supervisor also\nspoke with the foster parents. FCW said she has also spoken\nwith Birthmother about making up the missed visitation minutes.\nShe reported there is a community event activity coming up this\nweek where Birthmother can visit will get extra visitation time.\nThere is also a plan to extended Birthmother’s visitation by 25\nminutes. FCW was not sure whether all of what she reported to\nme was documented in her social work contacts; but reported the\nchildren’s visitation plan is in the children’s service plan.\n3",
    "Foster Care Supervisor\nOn 4/15/2025, I interviewed Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) by\ntelephone about the allegations. She reported the matter of the\nfoster parents being late to visitation appointments was brought to\nher attention on 3/20/2025. She affirmed FCW’s reporting about it\nbeing agency policy to extend parent/child visit when foster\nparents are late. She said the family support worker on this case\nmay not have been aware that the visits were to be extended\nwhen foster parents are late. FCS reported that since this matter\nwas brought to her attention, she, the family support supervisor,\nand the family support worker have addressed this matter, and\nthey are aware that Birthmother’s parent/child visitations are to be\nextended by the few minutes the foster parents are late. She\nreported Birthmother visitations are logged and there is\nsummarization by the family support worker or supervisor of the\nvisits. She provided me with copies of Birthmother’s visitation logs.\nShe reported the agency is continuing to work with Birthmother on\nthis matter. She also affirmed CA’s reporting that a special\nevaluation by the agency’s licensing department was initiated with\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 related to visitation issues.\nDocument Review\nChild A’s and Child B’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• Child B were removed from Birthmother’s care in August\n2024; and Child A in December 2024. Child A remained in\nthe neonatal intensive care unit after his premature birth\nuntil 1/7/2025, when he was placed with this agency.\n• Both Child A and Child B are temporary court wards. Child\nB has been placed with her father since 1/6/2025; and\nChild A in Foster Parent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s foster\nhome since 1/7/2025.\n• Reunification with Birthmother is the permanency plan.\n• An updated service plan for 1/23/2025- 4/22/2025 which\nshowed a discussion with the foster parents about arriving\nlate for parent/child visits; that Child A was late for one visit\non 3/12/2025 due to the transporter running late; and that\nmatter would be discussed with Birthmother.\n• Child A and Child B parent/child visitation plan as being\nsupervised at the agency one hour per week twice weekly,\nvia one way glass; foster parents are to arrive on time and\nbring back up items for the child, Birthmother is to arrive on\ntime and engage with the children.\n4",
    "Visitation Logs showing Birthmother’s visitation with Child A and\nChild B from 1/15/2025 to 3/26/2025 which showed:\n• Twice weekly one hour visitation times shown for\nBirthmother with Child A and Child B, at varying visitation\nhours prior to 5:00pm for dates prior to 3/3/2025. Though a\ncouple of those visits were two hours.\n• Two-hour visits on 3/3/2025, 3/12/2025, 3/28/2025; and\n3/26/2025 from 2:00pm-4:00pm\n• Child A’s arrival time as 2:47pm on 1/16/2025 for a 2:00pm-\n3:00pm scheduled visitation, and this visit went from\n2:48pm-3:48pm.\n• Child A’s arrival time as 1:45pm on 1/21/2025 for a\nscheduled 1:00pm-2:00pm visit, and this visit went from\n1:05pm (when Child B arrived) to 2:30pm.\n• Child A’s arrival time as 3:15pm on 3/12/2025 for a\nscheduled 2:00-4:00pm visit, and this visit went from\n2:00pm-4:00pm.\n• Child A’s arrival time as 3:15pm on 3/19/2025 for a\nscheduled 2:00-4:00pm visit and this visit went from\n2:00pm-4:00pm\n• Child A’s arrival time as 3:15pm on 3/19/2025 for 2:00pm-\n3:00pm and the visit going from 2:00pm-4:00pm\n• Five other times where Child A’s arrival time was listed as\nranging from 2-10 minutes after the scheduled visitation\ntime; and the visit went longer for varying minutes on three\nof those visits.\nFoster Parent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s CWLM record which\nshowed:\n• A special evaluation was initiated on 3/31/2025 related to\nallegations the foster parents were behaving in a manner\nnot consistent with being supportive of reunification;\nincluding being consistently late for parent/child visitations\nby at least 10 minutes causing the birth mother to lose time\nwith their child. The evaluation findings on this special\nevaluation is pending.\nAnalysis Following interviews and case document reviews the evidence\nshowed there had been late arrival times by the foster parents to\nBirthmother’s parent/child visits for Child A; and full visitation time\ndid not occur and have not all been made up. The evidence also\nshowed the agency is now addressing Birthmother’s concerns\naround these missed minutes and reports it is working to make\nthem up. It was FCW’s responsibility to have been aware that\nBirthmother was not receiving her full hour of visitation at each\nvisit prior to it being brought to her attention in March 2025.\n5",
    "Therein, the agency did not ensure for the parent/child visitation\nplan developed for this family, and it is in violation of this rule.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency\ncurrent license status is recommended.\nMay 23, 2025\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 23, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
