    "ALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that the agency closed a foster home license without notifying the foster\nparent.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn November 6, 2019 I received the complaint seen above. A special investigation\nwas initiated on the above said date. A foster parent, hereafter referred to as Foster\nParent A, and agency staff were interviewed. Documents were also reviewed. What\nfollows is information obtained from the aforementioned sources.\nOn November 21, 2019 Foster Parent A was interviewed by telephone. Foster Parent\nA reported that in October of 2019 she received a survey from Lansing. The survey\nwas for foster homes who had been closed. Foster Parent A reported that she was\nsurprised by this as she and her husband had never requested that their home be\nclosed and they were unaware that it had been closed. Foster Parent A reported that\nshe knew that their license had expired on December 25, 2018 but that agency staff\nnever called to offer to renew the license. Foster Parent A reported that prior to the\nlicense expiring she had told the agency foster care worker that she would not foster\nfor the agency anymore but did not want their license closed. Foster Parent A\nreported that on November 28, 2018 the adoption of the children in her care was\nfinalized and that she had no contact from with the agency from that point on. Foster\nParent A reported that the agency does not follow protocol and she did not think it\nwould be effective and beneficial to contact them. Foster Parent A stated, “I thought\nwe would let sleeping dogs lie”. Foster Parent A reiterated that she did not want to\nclose their license but did not want to remain licensed with the agency.\nOn January 6, 2020 the Chief Administrator and Program Supervisor were\ninterviewed. The program supervisor provided a letter and two emails that were sent\nto Foster Parent A. They are as follows below:\nAn email dated June 26, 2019 from the agency Quality Assurance Director and Chief\nAdministrator to Foster Parent A requests that Foster Parent A contact the agency\nregarding whether she wants to keep their license opened or if they want to close the\nlicense.\nAn email dated July 23, 2019 from the agency Quality Assurance Director and Chief\nAdministrator to Foster Parent A requests that Foster Parent A contact the agency\nregarding whether the foster parent wants to keep their license opened or if they want\nto close the license.\nA letter dated July 23, 2019 from the agency Quality Assurance Director to the Foster\nParent A speaks of several attempts by the agency to contact Foster Parent A. The\nletter requests that Foster Parent A contact the agency to verify if the she wants to\n3",
    "close their license or remain open. The letter requests that Foster Parent contact the\nagency if she has any questions.\nThe Chief Administrator and Program Supervisor each reported that the agency did\nnot receive a response from the Foster Parent A regarding the two emails and the\nagency letter. The Program Supervisor confirmed that the agency letter was sent to\nthe foster parent on July 23, 2019.\nA review of the CWL-3706 indicates that the foster home was closed on August 29,\n2019.\nOn January 28, 2020, Foster Parent A was contacted for a second interview by\ntelephone. I reviewed with Foster Parent A the email of June 26, 2019 from the\nagency to her. Foster Parent A confirmed that she did receive the email. Foster\nParent A reported that she did not respond to the email because she did not want to\nbe licensed by the agency. I asked Foster Parent A if had requested that the agency\ntransfer her license to another agency and she responded that she had not. Foster\nParent A reported that she did not receive the email dated July 23, 2019. Foster\nParent A reported that this email could have gone to her “spam” mailbox if the sender\nof the email was not recognized. Foster Parent A also denied that she had received\nthe agency hard copy letter dated July 23, 2019.\nThe addresses of the June 26, 2019 and July 23, 2019 emails were reviewed. Each\nemail was from the agency Quality Assurance Director and sent to the same email\naddress of Foster Parent A.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n1) An agency shall designate that the chief administrator is\nresponsible for the day-to-day operation of the agency and for\nensuring compliance with the applicable provisions of these\nrules.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency sent two emails and a hard copy letter to Foster\nParent A. Foster Parent A initially denied that she had received\nany communication from the agency regarding whether she\nwanted her license to remain open or closed. In the second\ninterview with Foster Parent A she acknowledged that she did\nreceive the June 26, 2019 email from the agency but did not\nrespond to it as she did not want to be licensed by the agency.\nEvidence indicates that the agency made three attempts to\ncontact Foster Parent A and did not receive a response form\nFoster Parent A.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED:\nI recommended that if the agency does not receive a response\nfrom a foster parent after two letters/emails that the third letter\nbe sent certified mail. The certified letter should inform the foster\nparent that the license will be closed if the foster parent does not\ncontact the agency by a specified date. The letters should also\nhave been generated and sent at a much earlier date.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation it was identified that foster home license of\nFoster Parent A had expired December 25, 2018. The foster home was not closed\nuntil August 29, 2019. An annual foster home evaluation was not completed.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n1) An agency shall conduct an annual on-site visit and\ncomplete a written reevaluation of a foster home.\nANALYSIS: The agency failed to initiate and complete a renewal evaluation\nresulting in the license expiring.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan the recommendation is for\ncontinuance of the regular license.\nFebruary 9, 2020\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 14, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
