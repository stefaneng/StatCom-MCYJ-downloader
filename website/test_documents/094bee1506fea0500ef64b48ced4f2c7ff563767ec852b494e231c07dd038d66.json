He reported Youth A had been struggling most of\nthe day and was constantly being redirected to calm down his\nbehaviors. Staff 1 reported Youth A engaged in negative behavior\nutilizing profanity during the time pastoral care was present. Youth A\nwas given a five-minute time out due to the use of profanity and\nconstant talking. He reported Youth A refused to take that time\nout which resulted in Youth A getting another consequence to go to\nhis room and complete a reflection. Within this consequence, all\nitems have to be removed from his room, including his bedding.\nWhen it came time for showers Youth A was the last to shower.\nWhen Youth A was in the shower, Staff 1 heard Youth A state he\nwas not going to follow through with his consequence and he was\ngoing to take his bed back into his room when he was heading back.\nWhen Youth A walked back from the shower, he got into a power\nstruggle with Staff 1 about wanting to do his hygiene in his\nroom but due to being on the consequence still, he was not allowed\nto have that privilege. Staff 1 reported Youth A completed his\nhygiene in the community bathroom and when Youth A was heading\nback to his room, he stated to Staff 1 he was going to take his bed\nback into his room. Staff 1 told Youth A he was not allowed to do that\ndue to the consequence he received. Youth A bent down to grab his\nbed, and Staff 1 put his foot on the bed to stop Youth\nA from grabbing it.

Staff 1 reported\nhe called Supervisor over for support right after the incident occurred.\nHe reported when he pushed Youth A it was with an open palm on\nhis chest and there were no intentions to harm Youth A. Staff 1\nreported he has been trained in Handle with Care, which is a restraint\nmodel staff have been trained in. He reported he is aware there is no\napproved technique to push a youth but, in this situation, he had no\nother way to protect himself. When asked what could have been\ndone differently, Staff 1 discussed how he could have called\nSupervisor over for support before Youth A went into the shower, as\nYouth A had been in a power struggle with Staff 1 for most of the\nshift.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on May\n13, 2024. Supervisor reported she responded to a call from Staff 1 on\nMay 6, 2024, due to concerns about Youth A’s behavior.

She reported staff should\nnot push a youth and if Youth A was attempting to charge at him then\nhe should have used blocking techniques. She reported she has no\nconcerns with Staff 1's interaction with the youth and noted he is\nstructured with the youth and programming.\nChief Administrator was interviewed via phone on May 10, 2024,\nand face to face at the facility on May 13, 2024.

Youth A walked out from\nthe left side of the video and Staff 1 was sitting at the table in front of\nYouth A’s bedroom door.

    "summary": "A staff member at the Kent County Juvenile Detention Center pushed a youth into his room, causing him to fall and hit his head, after a disagreement over a consequence involving the removal of his bedding. The investigation, including video review, substantiated the push but found no evidence the youth was assaulting the staff, violating policies prohibiting physical punishment and force outside approved techniques. This is a repeat violation, indicating a failure to ensure staff suitability and compliance with behavior management protocols; primary culpability lies with the staff member for the improper use of force and with facility management for failing to prevent recurring violations.",
