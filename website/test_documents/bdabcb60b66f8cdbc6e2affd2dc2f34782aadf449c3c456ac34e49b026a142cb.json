INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription • (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nsuitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation An agency worker was arrested by Genesse County Sheriffs on\n2/28/2025 for taking money from a grandfather for foster case\nserved by the agency. The grandfather was reportedly giving the\nworker money to pay for his daughter's rehab. He had been\ngiving the worker money since November. The elder task force\n2",
    "with the Genesee County Sheriff's Department caught the worker\ntaking $430.00 from the grandfather today. It appears that the\nworker reportedly took approximately $20,000.00 over the past 5\nmonths.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nDirector was interviewed via video conferencing on 3/24/2025.\nShe reported having received a call from Attorney, the Guardian\nAd Litem assigned to the case, reporting Relative A called\nAttorney to let her know he had concerns with money he had been\ngiving Foster Care Worker 1. Attorney stated Relative A told her\nhe had been giving Foster Care Worker 1 money for “a while” and\nFoster Care Worker 1 had asked him for over $20,000 during that\ntime. Director stated her understanding is that Foster Care Worker\n1 told Relative A his daughter, the mother of the child in Relative\nA’s care, was in a facility receiving substance abuse treatment in\nSault Ste. Marie. Foster Care Worker 1 told Relative A his\ndaughter was doing well in that facility, but the state would only\ncover a portion of the cost for her to stay, and he needed to pay\nthe remaining cost. Foster Care Worker 1 also asked Relative A to\npay for a tv for his daughter as well as a computer so she could\nenroll in school courses. Director’s understanding is that Relative\nA’s daughter called him at which time he learned she was not in\nSault Ste. Marie, which raised his red flags.\nDirector stated Foster Care Worker 1 started at their agency as a\nCase Aide while she completed her education. Once she earned\nher degree, she became a foster care worker. Director stated the\nagency had no concerns with her performance and multiple\nfamilies who knew her as a case aide requested her as their foster\ncare worker.\nLicensee Designee was interviewed via video conferencing on\n3/24/2025. She reported being in the administration building when\nshe received a call from Director on 2/28/2025 telling her she\nneeded to go to the program building. When she got there six\npolice officers were there with a warrant for Foster Care Worker\n1’s work items. She stated she did not know why they were there,\nbut the search warrant indicated they were investigating fraud.\nLicensee Designee stated the officers wanted documents and\nelectronic access related to all of Foster Care Worker 1’s cases,\nnot just the one named on the search warrant, so Licensee\nDesignee called the MDHHS Deputy Director who told her she\ncould provide the officers with everything they asked for. Licensee\nDesignee reported the officers didn’t say much to her, but they\nasked her if there would be any reason Foster Care Worker 1\nwould take money from Caregiver A for Parent A.\n3",
    "License Designee reported not having prior concerns with Foster\nCare Worker 1. She stated she had no suspicion of her acting\ninappropriately.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed on 3/24/2025 via video\nconferencing. She reported she was not working on 2/28/2025\nwhen she received a call from Director who wanted to know where\nFoster Care Worker 1 was because there were police at the\nagency. Foster Care Supervisor checked Foster Care Worker 1’s\nlocation using her iPhone which identified Foster Care Worker 1\nas being at a local farmer’s market. Foster Care Supervisor was\nnot given any additional information on that day. On 3/4/2025\nFoster Care Supervisor was copied in a group email which stated\nAttorney had told Caregiver A to not let anyone into his home.\nAttorney responded to that email indicating the case had been\nreassigned to an MDHHS worker because Foster Care Worker 1\nhad been arrested for taking $20-25,000 from Caregiver A. Foster\nCare Supervisor stated this was the first she had heard of the\nallegations.\nFoster Care Supervisor reported she had been directly assigned\nto Youth A’s case until Foster Care Worker 1 took over. She\nreported Caregiver A had offered her gas money in the past for\nhelping his daughter, but Foster Care Supervisor did not accept\nany money. Foster Care Supervisor stated she does not know if\nthe agency has a written policy about not accepting money, but\nshe has had conversations with all the workers she supervises\nabout not accepting anything from caregivers.\nFoster Care Supervisor reported she never had any concerns with\nFoster Care Worker 1’s job performance. She stated Foster Care\nWorker 1 would never strike her as someone who would do\nsomething like she is alleged to have done. Foster Care\nSupervisor has since called all the caregivers associated with\nyouths on Foster Care Worker 1’s caseload and no one has\nreported anything about Foster Care Worker 1 taking money from\nthem.\nFoster Care Worker 1 was interviewed by phone on 3/25/2025.\nShe stated she went to court for this family on 2/19/2025 at which\ntime she requested termination of Parent A’s rights. A week later,\nshe was taken into custody by the police. She stated no charges\nwere filed so she was released. She stated the police took her\nwork phone and computer and she voluntarily gave them her\npersonal phone, personal iPad and access to her two bank\n4",
    "accounts. She stated she took two lie detector tests and passed\nboth, adding she drove an hour away and paid $850 for one of the\ntests. She would not state why she was taken into custody and\nwould not answer whether she took anything from Caregiver A on\nthe advice of her attorney. She reported she has heard that the\npeople making accusations against her aren’t cooperating with the\ninvestigation and are refusing to take lie detector tests, so the\nallegations won’t be going anywhere.\nFoster Care Worker 1 stated the agency has a policy that staff\ncannot take anything from caregivers.\nFoster Care Worker 2 was interviewed by phone on 3/25/2025.\nShe reported having worked a couple of desks down in the same\nroom as Foster Care Worker 1. She stated she would help Foster\nCare Worker 1 with writing service plans and with court\npreparation for Youth A’s case. She stated there was one court\nhearing during which Foster Care Worker 1 testified she had\nreached out to Parent A through social media, which Foster Care\nWorker 2 found strange because it was against agency policy to\ndo so. Foster Care Worker 2 reported the agency workers “have\nalways been told” to not accept and never ask for anything from\nparents or caregivers. Foster Care Worker 2 stated she has never\nheard Foster Care Worker 1 ask any caregivers or parents for\nmoney. Foster Care Worker 2 stated the agency would not\napprove of or condone a worker taking money from anyone they\nwork with.\nFoster Care Worker 3 was interviewed by phone on 3/27/2025.\nShe reported she and Foster Care Worker 1 were very close. She\nstated they were work partners and sat beside one another in their\noffice. Foster Care Worker 3 stated she does not know a lot about\nthe investigation, but she never had any suspicions that Foster\nCare Worker 1 was doing anything inappropriate. Foster Care\nWorker 3 stated she helped Foster Care Worker 1 a lot with this\ncase. She stated Parent A was AWOL and had been for several\nmonths. Foster Care Worker 3 went with Foster Care Worker 1 to\nParent A’s home to knock on her door a few times, but there were\nno answers. She never heard Foster Care Worker 1 state that\nParent A was in Sault Ste. Marie, but she did hear her tell\nCaregiver A she thought Parent A might be in Florida. Foster Care\nWorker 3 attended court with Foster Care Worker 1 who reported\nshe was making attempts to locate Parent A. Foster Care Worker\n3 stated Foster Care Worker 1 has a big heart and wanted Parent\nA to do well.\n5",
    "Foster Care Worker 3 stated the agency is very strict about not\naccepting anything from caregivers or parents and the workers\nshould document if anyone tries to give them anything. She stated\nthere have been times parents have tried to give her money for\ntheir kids, which she refused and documented. She stated she\nhas one case in which the parents have repeatedly wanted to give\nher money for her child to participate in pageants, but she tells the\nparent to give the money directly to the child and Foster Care\nWorker 3 will tell the caregiver. Foster Care Worker 3 stated she\nhas talked to Foster Care Worker 1 about this during her training\nperiod and told Foster Care Worker 1 it would be inappropriate to\ntake money from caregivers or parents\nCaregiver A was interviewed by phone on 3/27/2025. He reported\nhe has given Foster Care Worker 1 approximately $28,000 since\nNovember of 2024. He stated he started giving Foster Care\nWorker 1 money after she stated the agency wanted him to adopt\nYouth A, but he wanted to do a guardianship. She said if he\nwanted to do a guardianship, he had to pay for it himself. He told\nher he was fine with that and started giving her money in the\namounts she told him he needed to. At one point, when Caregiver\nA’s daughter, Parent A, was AWOL, Foster Care Worker 1 told\nCaregiver A that Parent A had called Foster Care Worker 1 and\ntold her she thought she was going to die. Foster Care Worker 1\ntold Caregiver A she found Parent A on the street and called him\nasking what she should do. Caregiver A told Foster Care Worker 1\nto bring Parent A to the local hospital, and he would pay for her\ncare. Foster Care Worker 1 told Caregiver A that Parent A did not\nwant him to come visit her in the condition she was in and that she\ncould not talk to him. Caregiver A stated he lay in bed crying that\nnight and worried his daughter was going to die. The following\nday, Foster Care Worker 1 called and told Caregiver A Parent A\nwas doing better and was going to go to a drug rehab facility in\nSault Ste. Marie, but she did not want to talk with Caregiver A at\nthat time. When Caregiver A called later to speak with Parent A,\nFoster Care Worker 1 told him she had already been picked up\nand was being transported to the rehab facility. Whenever\nCaregiver A asked Foster Care Worker 1 if he could talk to or visit\nParent A, she told him Parent A was in lockdown and was not\nallowed to talk to or write anyone. Caregiver A stated Foster Care\nWorker 1 told him Parent A could have a private room at the\nfacility for $2,200 which Caregiver A gave to Foster Care Woker 1.\nFoster Care Worker 1 told Caregiver A that Parent A was\nprogressing in the program and was being enrolled in classes for\nwhich she needed a laptop. Caregiver A paid for the computer as\nwell as for a tv and clothing for Parent A by giving money to Foster\n6",
    "Care Worker 1. He stated, at one point, Foster Care Worker 1 told\nCaregiver A that Parent A had gotten into a fight at the facility and\nneeded 7 stitches in her hand, which Caregiver A gave her money\nfor. Caregiver A stated he would have paid any amount of money\nto save his daughter’s life.\nCaregiver A stated Foster Care Worker 1 told him they didn’t want\nanyone to know where Parent A was when she was in rehab\nbecause if they did, they would take her parental rights away.\nCaregiver A stated he went to court every 3 months during which\nFoster Care Worker 1 would say she didn’t know where Parent A\nwas. During the most recent hearing, the judge told Foster Care\nWorker 1 to go to Parent A’s mother’s door and leave papers and\nto search for Parent A on social media. After court, Caregiver A\nmet Foster Care Worker 1 at a library and gave her more money.\nCaregiver A stated he went to Parent A’s mother’s home to tell her\nnot to tell anyone that Parent A was in Sault Ste. Marie. When he\nknocked on the door, Parent A answered. She told Caregiver A\nshe had never been to a rehab facility in Sault Ste. Marie.\nCaregiver A was shocked and talked with Parent A about what\nFoster Care Worker 1 had been telling him. He learned Parent A\nhad never been to the hospital, had never been in a fight, and\nFoster Care Worker 1 had not bought her a computer, clothes, or\nany of the things Foster Care Worker 1 took money from\nCaregiver A for.\nCaregiver A stated he called Attorney and told her that he had\nbeen giving money to Foster Care Worker 1. He stated he later\nmet with the police to provide a report. He also provided the\ndetective with his phone data and messages from Foster Care\nWorker 1 telling Caregiver A how much money he needed and\nwhere to meet. He stated he later called Foster Care Worker 1\nwho told him she needed $460 toward his guardianship case. He\nstated the police gave him the money to give Foster Care Worker\n1, put a body cam in Caregiver A’s pocket, and gave him a cell\nphone to leave open in his truck so officers could hear his\ninteraction with Foster Care Worker 1. He met Foster Care Worker\n1 at a local parking lot and gave her the $460. She took the\nmoney and told him she would need more money for the\nguardianship the following Monday. Caregiver A stated he left and\ngave the officers their phone and body cam.\nCaregiver A stated the week following Foster Care Worker 1’s\narrest, he spoke to Detective and provided his bank account\ninformation so Detective could verify the amounts of money\nCaregiver A withdrew to give Foster Care Worker 1. He stated he\n7",
    "has not heard from the detective since and has complied with\neverything asked of him.\nCaregiver A stated he likes Foster Care Worker 1 and that she is\nreally good person. He stated she had fooled him and if he hadn’t\nstopped at Parent A’s mother’s house that day, he would still be\ngiving her money.\nAttorney was interviewed by phone on 4/7/2025. She reported\nshe was contacted by Caregiver A who reported he had been\ngiving money to Foster Care Worker 1. She stated she reached\nout to law enforcement after which Detective was assigned.
