DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nPrior to the issuance of this license, all of the Lutheran Adoption Services (LAS)\noffices across Michigan’s Lower Peninsula were under one license. The agency\ndecided to split the adoption services up into two separate licenses. The original\nlicense will continue to cover the east side of the state and the new license will cover\nthe west side of the state including Lansing, Grand Rapids, and Kalamazoo.\nCurrently LAS has an office located in Lansing; this will be the facility location for this\nlicense. The office they are located in is a new building that the agency moved into\nwithin the last year. All the adoption workers who work out of the Lansing office will\nwork out of this location. The offices have sufficient space and resources to provide\nthe services for which they are licensed. Other offices include one in Grand Rapids\nand one in Kalamazoo that adoption staff work out of.\nB. Program Description\nLutheran Adoption Service (LAS), is a jointly owned subsidiary of Wellspring\nLutheran Services and Lutheran Social Services of Michigan. LAS is licensed to\nplace and supervise children in adoptive placements and recruit and assess families\nfor adoption. LAS also provides adoptive families with Pre and post adoption\nresources to ensure children receive the services and resources they need. LAS\nserves counties throughout the entire State of Michigan, exclusive of the Upper\n2",
    "Peninsula. The agency does not collect fees when a family adopts a child from the\nfoster care system and does not discriminate against adoption applicants because of\nrace, sexual orientation or religious background.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing statues and rules as well as\nDHS Adoption policy and the MSA.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend Lutheran Adoption Services in Lansing be issued an original six-\nmonth provisional license.\n08/13/2014\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n08/13/2014\n________________________________________\nGregory V.
