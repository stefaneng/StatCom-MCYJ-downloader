She reported a knee injury she\nexperienced months prior to the allegations, resulting in a mild\nstrain. Youth A recalled playing basketball recently when she felt\nlike she hurt her knee again. That day Staff 1 called the facility’s\nmedical services phone line and was instructed to have Youth A\ntake ibuprofen and ice her knee. Youth A reported using ice for\nher knee but declined taking any over-the-counter pain\nmedication. She stated that sometime later Youth A wrote a\nmedical complaint regarding her knee. The following day Nurse 1\nvisited Youth A’s unit to see another youth, but did not see\nher. Youth A recalled Nurse 1 stating “I’m only here to see one\nperson.” Youth A recalled continuing to ice her knee until Nurse 1\ncame to see her the morning of this interview. Youth A was sent\nout to have her knee examined that morning, but the visit was\nunsuccessful due to complications regarding her insurance.\nChief Administrator was interviewed over the phone on\n03/20/2025 and 05/01/2025. She recalled Youth A’s past knee\nissues that began prior to her placement at the facility. Chief\nAdministrator did not have any concern over proper attention paid\nto possible injuries to Youth A. Chief Administrator provided\nfurther detail on the course of events after Youth A injured her\nknee. The medical service line was contacted on the same day of\nthe injury, 03/14/2025, with recommendations that the youth could\nbe treated without leaving the facility. Youth A was taken to\nurgent care on 03/20/2025 at Youth A’s request, but was unable to\nbe seen because of insurance issues. She returned to urgent\ncare for medical attention the following day on 03/21/2025, but\n2",
    "that was not because of her knee and was because of Youth A\npunching a wall on 03/21/2025 and injuring her hand. Chief\nAdministrator confirmed Youth A had not been sent back out to\nexternal medical professionals for her knee. She also stated the\nmedical service line was contacted on 03/25/2025 to further\nassess Youth A’s knee, and the same recommendations of over-\nthe-counter treatments were provided.\nNurse 1 was interviewed over the phone on 04/25/2025. She\nrecalled the instance of Youth A playing basketball and hurting her\nknee. She could not recall when she saw Youth A.
