    "ALLEGATION:\nAgency failed to complete proper background checks prior to licensure.\nINVESTIGATION:\nA complaint was received on 6/15/20. The complaint came in via e-mail from the\nagency. The e-mail stated that the agency had failed to conduct background checks\non an Adult Household Member (AHM) who moved into Foster Home A in November\nof 2019 until May of 2020. The Household member has extensive Child Protective\nService (CPS) history. The agency asked for the AHM to leave the home.\nA Timeline of events was supplied by the agency. The timeline indicated that the\nAHM moved into the home and licensing was notified on 11/15/19. AHM supplied\nbackground check releases on 1/29/20. The documentation was sent to the\ndepartment on 5/12/20. On 6/3/20 the agency was notified that the AHM had CPS\nhistory and the AHM was asked to leave the home. On 6/4/20 the department\nnotified the agency that the AHM had extensive past and current CPS involvement.\nThe timeline of events supplied by the agency indicated that the licensing worker\n(Worker 1) assigned to the home was terminated from her position. Contact\ninformation was provided however the phone call could not be completed. Each time\na call was attempted the phone indicated “user busy.” A review of Worker 1’s\npersonnel documentation found that she had previously been disciplined for not\nreporting potential abuse/neglect in 2017, reporting and record keeping in 2018,\ntimeliness of evaluations in 2016, 2017, and 2019. On 2/7/20 Worker 1 received a\ndiscipline for giving a foster home advance warning of a CPS investigation, not\ncompleting a timely and thorough special evaluation and unprofessional boundaries.\nThis discipline stated that Worker 1 had to be removed from three separate foster\nhomes cases due to concerns with boundaries. A corrective action plan (CAP) was\nput in place for Worker 1.\nTermination documentation was reviewed. A note indicated that Worker 1 admitted\nto management that she did not complete Central Registry or Criminal History\nchecks on the AHM. The documentation states that despite her CAP’s Worker 1\ncontinued to have “poor work performance.” On 6/3/20 the agency was notified by\nCPS that an AHM in Foster Home A had CPS history. A review of MiSACWIS found\nthat the clearance documentation was not in the home file. The agency contacted\nthe home and informed them that the AHM had to leave the home. On 6/4/20 after\nbeing asked to provide documentation of the background checks Worker 1 sent an\ne-mail indicating she did not have a record of the clearance checks. Worker 1 stated\nshe was informed by Foster Home A that the AHM moved into the home on\n11/15/2019. She stated that she had not been able to collect the clearance\ndocumentation until 1/29/20 and she did not receive the AHM license until April of\n2020. Worker 1 then sent a request to the Human Resource department at the\nagency asking them to run clearances for the AHM. The clearances were completed\n3",
    "that same day. Further, when Worker 1 met with her supervisor in May 2020 Worker\n1 was asked about a DCWL 1326 Record Clearance which is sent up to the\ndepartment for completion of Central Registry and criminal history clearances for the\nAHM. Worker 1 reported that a 1326 had not been completed. She had the form\ncompleted on 5/12/20 and the results were received from the department with\nextensive CPS history. Children were placed in the home at the time the AHM\nmoved into the home. Those children were removed from the home and other\nchildren were admitted into the home in January of 2020. Worker 1 did not report\nany issues with clearances at the time the children were placed in January.\nAn e-mail from Worker 1 to management stated she did have a text from Foster\nHome A on 11/15/20 that the AHM had moved into the home. She also stated in her\ne-mail that she did not get the DCWL 1326 from the AHM until 1/29/20 and she did\nnot get a copy of the AHM’s driver’s license to run the Central Registry Clearance.\nShe finally received the driver’s license on 4/30/20. She stated she did not know if\nthe DCWL 1326 was ever sent to the department.\nThe DCWL 1326 was provided and did have a date of 1/29/20 on the form that was\nsigned by the AHM. The background check authorization form was signed by the\nAHM on 1/27/20.\nWorker 1 received training in boundaries on 2/9/18. She received licensing training\nfrom the department in 2012 and 2013 and again in 2017.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12309 Records check.\n(1) An agency shall, upon receipt of an application, request\nthe department of state police to conduct both a criminal\nhistory check and a criminal records check through the\nfederal bureau of investigation for applicants. The\nagency shall also request the department to conduct a\ncriminal history check on all persons residing in the\nhome over 18 years of age. Additional checks shall\npertain to previous licenses, and substantiated child\nabuse and neglect records for all applicants and\npersons residing in the home 18 years of age or over in\nMichigan and in all states where the applicant has\nresided in the 5 years preceding the application.\n4",

The report also\nindicated that Foster Mom was not talking to two of her three adult daughters\n5",
    "and she did not have a way to get in touch with them. This was not elaborated\non in the report and the adult child references were not completed on the two\ndaughters.\n 9/28/17 CPS Investigation initiated on Foster Home A.

The documents supporting the evaluation were letters from Foster\nMother’s three daughters indicating why they did not want to live with their\nmother as well as a psychological assessment done on the Foster Mother for\nfriend of the court in 2012. The report stated that the Foster Mother needed to\nengage in outpatient psychotherapy to help her deal with her erratic emotions\nand inconsistent living circumstances. The medical statement from initial\nlicensure does not indicate the cancer diagnoses brought up by Foster Mom.\nAlso, a statement made by Worker 1 to the Foster Care Review Board stated\nthat the foster mother’s adult children were given a chance to have input\nregarding their mother at the time of licensure and they did not provide any\ninformation.\n 6/4/20 Worker 1 was suspended pending an investigation.\n 6/10/20 The children were removed from the foster home.\n 6/10/20 Worker 1 was terminated.\nSocial Work contacts were reviewed for the Foster Family.

She has not been in licensing for a while and she could not\nremember the Foster Home in question. She said she did supervise Worker 1 for\nalmost two years which was the entire time she was a supervisor of licensing. When\nasked if she had any concerns with Worker 1 she stated that there was nothing\nalarming; adding, Worker 1 would bond with the families. Other people may have\nthought it was an issue, but Supervisor 2 did not think it was. She said the people\nwho had an issue with it did not work in licensing and they did not know that it was\nimportant to have a bond with the foster homes. She was asked if this bond would\ncause issues with Worker 1 following through on things with the family and she\nstated she was not aware of any issues. Supervisor 2 said Worker 1 was\noverwhelmed sometimes and they would meet to work on prioritizing her work.\nSupervisor 2 was asked if she was terminated as a result of anything that had to do\nwith licensing, and she stated she was never given a reason for her termination. She\nstated she was told she was at will and could be let go without reason.\n7",
    "Supervisor 3 Interview: Supervisor 3 was interviewed via telephone on 8/10/20.\nShe stated that she provided the foster parents with the findings of her investigations\non Thursday and she will be writing the Special Evaluation when she returns from\nvacation next week. She stated that she is recommending their license be revoked\nbecause the family was not truthful during the licensing process and failed to\ndisclose CPS, Friend of the Court, and mental health history. She stated the Foster\nMother also said she was diagnosed with cancer, but her doctor reported she never\nhad a cancer diagnosis.\nSupervisor 3 said she started in January 2020, but she did not know the homes until\nFebruary. She became familiar with the Foster Home when the kids were first placed\nin the home (1/28/20). She supervised the Licensing Worker (Worker 1) since\nJanuary 2020. She stated prior to her becoming Worker 1's supervisor Worker 1 had\nbeen written up for boundary issues with a different foster home. She stated there\nwere issues with Worker 1's timeliness. Supervisor 3 said Supervisor 2 supervised\nWorker 1 prior to her. She said Supervisor 2 Supervised Worker 1 until November or\nDecember when she transferred to another part of the agency. Supervisor 2 has\nsince been terminated. Supervisor 3 said she did not know why Supervisor 2 was\nterminated.\nSupervisor 3 stated that she was involved in Worker 1's last write-up and\nsubsequent termination. Worker 1 was terminated for not completing thorough\ninvestigations. Supervisor 3 said she was shocked that Worker 1's reports were\napproved the way they were written. After Worker 1 was terminated, Supervisor 3\nsaid she went through all the case files and has been making changes to how they\ncomplete their work.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in\nthe agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(c) Conduct a thorough investigation including all\nnecessary contacts.\nANALYSIS: In review of all the Special Evaluations it was found that Worker\n1 did not conduct a thorough investigation. She did not follow up\non information provided by Foster Mom A’s daughter, she did\nnot try to access the psychological evaluation and she did not\nconduct all necessary contacts.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n8",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12310 Initial evaluation.\n(3) The report shall be an assessment of all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Visits at the residence of the foster home\napplicants for observations of, and interviews with,\neach member of the household to determine all of\nthe following:\n(iv) Physical, mental, and emotional health of\neach member of the household.\nANALYSIS: Worker 1 did not provide an assessment of Foster Mom A’s\nphysical or mental health within the initial evaluation. She did\nnot address the fact that what Foster Mom A reported about\nher history did not match her medical statement. Worker 1\nalso did not address the issue of Foster Mom not being in\ncontact with two of her adult daughters.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12310 Initial evaluation.\n(3) The report shall be an assessment of all of the following:\n(c) Previous criminal convictions, and substantiated\nchild abuse or neglect for investigations or concerns\nbrought to the agency's or department's attention for\nany member of the household.\nANALYSIS: Worker 1 was provided with information that Foster Mother A\nhad CPS history prior to the home being licensed; however, she\nnever updated the initial evaluation to include this information.\nShe also did not reach out to Foster Mother A’s adult daughters\nto get adult child references and input into the CPS history of\ntheir mother.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(2) The annual reevaluation shall include a determination\nand assessment of all of the following:\n9",
    "(a) All changes to the factual information contained in\nthe initial evaluation and subsequent renewal\nevaluations.\nANALYSIS: The reevaluation which was supposed to be conducted in May\nof 2018 did not have an assessment of Foster Mother A’s CPS\nhistory and mental health history which was discovered by the\nagency prior to licensure and again during the Special\nEvaluations that were conducted on the home prior to the\nreevaluation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of the above investigation it was found that Worker 1 did not\ncommunicate with the department in regard to the CPS investigation that occurred\njust prior to the home being licensed. The provider record shows that the Initial Foster\nHome Study, 3130, was submitted to the department on 9/13/17. A CPS investigation\nwas started on 9/28/17. Contacts in MiSACWIS indicate Worker 1 had\ncommunication with the DHHS Worker conducting the investigation during the course\nof the investigation. There were not any contacts listed between the Worker and\nDCWL prior to licensure. The worker was required to do an addendum to the 3130 to\naddress questions that DCWL had and that addendum also did not mention the CPS\ninvestigation.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12325 License recommendation.\n(2) An agency shall document foster home license changes in\nthe foster home record and shall communicate the\nchanges immediately to the department in the manner\nprescribed by the department.\nANALYSIS: Worker 1 did not notify the department when a CPS\ninvestigation was initiated on the home prior to the home\nbeing licensed by the department.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n10",
    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nA review of MiSACWIS found that Foster Home A’s license was up for renewal on\n5/15/18 however the report was not started until 7/13/18 and finished on 10/26/18.\nThe timeline of events from the agency stated that it was completed late due to the\ntwo open Special Evaluations however the Special Evaluations which were initiated\non 2/23/18 and 4/13/18 were completed on 7/6/18 and 7/10/18. The application was\nsigned by the Foster Parents on 5/21/18. A letter to the Foster Parents was dated\n5/11/18 and the home visit done by Worker 1 to complete the Children’s Foster Care\nHome Rule Compliance Record (BCAL-3080) was done on 5/21/18.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(8) An agency shall complete a reevaluation and shall make a\nlicensing recommendation to the department at least 15\ncalendar days before the expiration date of the foster home\nlicense.\nANALYSIS: The provider record indicates that Worker 1 did not get an\napplication for renewal and did not assess Foster Home A’s\nhome until after the license had expired. It was several\nmonths after the license expired before a reevaluation report\nwas completed and approved.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nIn the above investigation it was discovered that Worker 1 did not follow-up on\ncritical information about a foster home. She did not address Foster Mother A’s\nmental health, CPS history and Friend of the Court history. She also did not get\nclearances for the adult who was living in the foster home with foster children.\nSocial Work contacts and Special Evaluation reports indicate Worker 1 was informed\nof Foster Mother A’s history. The reports of Foster Mom’s history were never\naddressed by Worker 1 in the Special Evaluations. These Special Evaluations were\napproved by Supervisor 2 even though the evaluations were not thoroughly\ncompleted.\n11",
    "Subsequent evaluations for the renewal and annual also did not address the history.\nThese reports were also approved by Supervisor 2.\nAn e-mail from Worker 1 indicated she received notice of the adult household\nmember moving into the home in November of 2019 but the AHM was not cleared\nuntil June of 2020.\nThe Special Evaluations completed by Worker 1 and the Renewal evaluation she\ncompleted were not completed timely. The Special Evaluations took two and three\nmonths to complete even though minimal work was put into the reports. The\nRenewal, which was due in May of 2018 was started in July of 2018 and completed\nin October of 2018.\nWorker 1’s employee file indicates she had been written up for having boundary\nissues with the foster parents she worked with. Those boundary issues led to\nWorker 1 being taken off three cases. Despite this Supervisor 2 indicated she did not\nthink Worker 1’s boundaries were an issue.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications.\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training\nto perform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: All the documentation reviewed for this investigation indicates\nWorker 1 and Supervisor 2 did not have the ability,\nexperience, education, or training to perform the duties as\nrequired.\nTechnical Assistance: ensure training records for all staff are\nkept up to date and easily accessible.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n12",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan it is recommended that this\ninvestigation be closed with no further licensing action.\n8/28/20\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 8, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n13"
