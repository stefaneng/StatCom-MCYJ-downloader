    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection (1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\nDescription contact with children or parents to be a person who has the ability,\nexperience, education, and training to perform the duties\nassigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The Foster Care Supervisor yelled and berated the caregiver\nduring a telephone call related to an issue that happened\npertaining to the foster children.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 5/6/2024 I reviewed the complaint allegations with the\nCaregiver and interviewed the Caregiver by telephone. The\nCaregiver reported the complaint is not about an inappropriate\nremoval of her grandchildren from her home, as the complaint\ninformation had suggested. The complaint is about the Foster\nCare Supervisor’s unprofessional behavior and tone in speaking\nwith her on an issue involving her grandchildren on 5/3/2024.\nThe Caregiver reported she has placement of her three\ngrandchildren, Child 1(age 16), Child 2 (age 12) and Child 3 (age\n11). She reported on 5/2/2024 Child 1 told her therapist\nsomething about a conversation that occurred with the birth\nmother and the Foster Care Worker and Foster Care Supervisor\ncalled the Caregiver about this and reported all three children\nwould be going for a weekend visit with Child 2’s and Child 3’s\nfather. It was not Child 2’s and Child 3’s scheduled week to visit\ntheir father, and Child 1 normally did not attend the weekend\nvisits. The Caregiver reported during the call the Foster Care\nSupervisor yelled at her and berated her. She told the Foster Care\nSupervisor three times to stop yelling at her. The Caregiver said\nthere was no one else on her end who heard the Foster Care\nSupervisor yelling at her. She did not contact the Foster Care\nSupervisor’s supervisor, or another agency administrator to\ncomplain about the Foster Care Supervisor’s behavior, or to file a\ngrievance of the matter. She said the incident happened late on\nFriday and it was too late to call the agency then. Nor did she call\nthe agency, or agency administrator to complain about the matter\nsince then.\n2",
    "The Caregiver reported an understanding that it may be her word\nagainst the Foster Care Supervisor’s.\nOn 5/6/2024 I spoke with the Chief Administrator (CA) about the\nallegations by telephone. The CA reported having no reason to\nbelieve either the Foster Care Worker or Foster Care Supervisor\nwould behave in an unprofessional manner with any caregiver.\nShe denied either staff having disciplinary actions against them.\nThe CA wanted it known the case this matter connects to is an\nunusual one. The reason being due to its prior county’s familial\nconnections causing it to be transferred; and that the Caregiver is\nvery angry the birth mother isn’t getting the children back.\nAdditionally, that there was an incident involving the birthmother\nand Child 1 whereby the birth mother was irate and verbally\nattacked Child 1 over the children possibly being placed with Child\n2’s and Child 3’s birth father. During that incident, the Caregiver\nwas present; and the incident caused Child 1 to have an anxiety\nattack. Child 2 and Child 3 also witnessed the incident between\nChild 1 and the birth mother, and they too are having anxiety to\nthe point of vomiting. The Foster Care Worker and Foster\nSupervisor Care had a phone conversation with the Caregiver\nabout this incident, and a visitation plan for the children. The CA\nreported no knowledge of either staff berating the Caregiver.\nOn 5/6/2024 I interviewed the Foster Care Supervisor about the\nallegations by telephone. She confirmed the information about the\ncase as reported by the Chief Administrator; but denied the\nallegations. She reported after Child 1’s therapist expressed\nconcern about an incident between Child 1 and the birth mother;\nhow Child 1 was very upset over the birth mother’s and\nCaregiver’s actions at that incident; the agency sought to speak\nwith the Caregiver about the incident. The Foster Care Supervisor\nsaid the agency wanted there to be a time out for all by having all\nthree children go for a weekend visit at Child 2’s and Child 3’s\nbirth father’s home. The Foster Care Supervisor reported she and\nthe Foster Care Worker were on a three-way call with the\nCaregiver about the case matter. She began the conversation by\nasking the Caregiver what happened. The Foster Care Supervisor\nadmitted that after the Caregiver was seeming to give a “vanilla”\nexplanation of the incident (meaning to sugar coat the incident),\nshe challenged the Caregiver over what the Caregiver was saying.\nThe Foster Care Supervisor said she is a loud talker; and she\nadmitted to talking loudly during the call. She reported loud talking\noccurred both ways. The Caregiver was trying to talk over her.\n3",
    "The Foster Care Supervisor denied yelling at or berating the\nCaregiver.\nOn 5/6/2024 I interviewed the Foster Care Worker about the\nallegations by telephone. She affirmed being on the three-way call\nwith the Caregiver and the Foster Care Supervisor. The Foster\nCare Worker said she called the Foster Care Supervisor, and then\nadded the Caregiver to the call. She affirmed the purpose of the\ncall with the Caregiver as that reported by the Foster Care\nSupervisor. She reported the Foster Care Supervisor did the\nmajority of the talking during the three-way call. She said there\nwas back and forth conversation during the call with quick talking,\nbut no yelling or raised voices. She said there was a point when\nthe Foster Care Supervisor said she was disappointed with the\nactions the Caregiver and the birth mother took, that it seemed\nthey put the birth mother’s feelings over Child 1’s, but no one\nyelled or berated the Caregiver.\nDocument Review:\nMISCAWIS Case record for Child 1, Child 2 and Child 3 which\nshowed:\n• All three children are temporary court wards.\n• All three children were placed in the Caregiver’s home on\n8/9/2023.\nAnalysis The agency is in compliance with this rule because the Foster\nCare Supervisor and Foster Care Worker who were on the call\nwith the Caregiver both denied the allegations; and there is no one\nelse to corroborate the allegations.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n4",
