She reported Youth A was very specific about the time\nframe being three to five minutes within the clothing closet with Staff 1.\nComplaint Source reported she was present when Youth A went to be\nseen by medical and Youth A’s description of the incident was not\nconsistent with the story he shared with other staff.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on April 4, 2024,\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker.

He reported typically a staff will hold the door open and the youth\nwill go in to get their clothing items and come immediately back out.\nYouth A reported the rule is the door can never be shut due to safety\nconcerns. He was asked if there were any other concerns with Staff 1\nbefore this situation and he reported about a month ago Staff 1 came\ninto his room threatening him to fight him.

He reported Staff 1 also pinched and poked him with\na pen but did not remember when this occurred. Youth A reported he\ndoes not want Staff 1 working on his unit because that makes him feel\nunsafe.

Staff 1 denied he ever got into a fighting stance,\npunched, or stated, “It’s on now” to Youth A. When asked about the\ntraining on the clothing closet, Staff 1 reported if there is a second staff\nworking to maintain the line of sight of the youth, a staff can go in and\ngrab the clothing items alone for the youth.
