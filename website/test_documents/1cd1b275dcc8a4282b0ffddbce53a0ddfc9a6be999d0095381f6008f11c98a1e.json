Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that\n4",
    "there are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance with all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a MDHHS Contract violation. Please\nnote that there are additional MDHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not\nbe included in section 1. The facility is in compliance with all additional MDHHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nFOM 722-06B Family team meeting\nPage 5\nFTMs must occur within the required time frames as outlined in\nthe following tables:\nUpdated Case Plan (USP) - within 30 calendar days before the\ncase plan due date.\nThree of eight case files did not have FTMs documented prior to completion of an\nupdated service plan.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4/15/21 RENEWAL, CAP approved 4/26/21\nFOM 722-08D Treatment plans\nPage 11\nThe caseworker must obtain signatures from all applicable\nindividuals and upload the signatures pages into the electronic\ncase record within 30 days of the report date.\nThree of eight case files (five of seventeen PATPs) had late or missing treatment\nplan signatures.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7/8/20 INTERIM, CAP approved 7/8/20\nFOM 722-06H Case contacts\nPage 19\nThe caseworker must enter the required face-to-face contacts\nlisted below in MISACWIS within five business days of the\ncontact. This includes attempted and missed face-to-face\ncontacts.\nFive of eight case files held late contact entry. Six entries were 1-20 days late.\nFOM 722-06H Case contacts\nPage 23\nAfter return home, first month- weekly in-person contacts with\nthe parent(s) and child(ren) in the home.\nOne of eight case files was missing one weekly home visit with a child that was\nreturned to their parent.\n5",
    "FOM 801-01 Health requirements\nPage 4\nA dental re-examination shall be obtained at least every six\nmonths unless a greater frequency is indicated.\nOne of eight case files held a dental that was not completed within the required\ntimeframe. One dental occurred on 3/10/21, the next was late on 12/21/21.\nFOM 801-03 Medical Passports\nPage 2-3\nAll medical information within the medical passport must be\ncurrent and updated at least quarterly to reflect the child's\ncurrent and complete health information.\nReceipt of the medical passport by the above listed parties is\ndocumented in MiSACWIS by uploading the signed and dated\nsignature page into the Health Profile section.\nTwo of eight case files did not have quarterly updated medical passports, signed by\nthe parent.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Some licensing renewal letters indicated the family must complete an\napplication but did not indicate the application was provided. There must be\ndocumentation in the file to show the date the application was provided in\norder to determine the rule requirement was met.\n Borrowed Bed case files had a coversheet to document when items were\nreceived, including endorsement of the reports received at the beginning of\nthe agreement. However, the agency should update the form to document\nendorsement of subsequent reports received for the duration of the Borrowed\nBed agreement.\n Head Start progress/updates should be entered under the education tab in\nMiSACWIS.\n Parents & Foster Parents must date their signature on PATP and Medical\nPassport to verify they are signed within the required timeframe.\n FTMs completed via video conference must indicate who attended and how\nthe FTM occurred.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require consultation during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\n6",
    "One special evaluation was completed during this review period, in which it was\ndetermined there was a preponderance of evidence of sexual abuse and physical\ndiscipline. The agency recommended revocation of the foster home license.\nRevocation is currently pending with the Disciplinary Action Unit of DCWL.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nOne special evaluation was initiated after an allegation the foster parent hit a foster\nchild in the home. Upon investigation it was determined the foster parent ‘swatted’\nthe child’s arm, on one occasion. The home was found in violation of licensing rules\nand a corrective action plan was developed. The CAP included review of the\nbehavior management agreement and foster parent agency agreement. The foster\nparent also completed additional behavior management training.\nOne special evaluation was initiated after an allegation the foster parent spanked a\nfoster child in the home. A change of placement was considered. However, the\nagency determined a change of placement was not necessary with implementation\nof a safety plan including additional agency supervision. Upon investigation it was\ndetermined the foster parent was in violation of licensing rules and a CAP was\ndeveloped. The CAP included the safety plan, policy review, additional training, and\nunannounced home visits by the case worker.\nOverall, it was assessed the agency completed these special evaluations\nappropriately and developed sufficient corrective action plans to ensure children’s\nsafety.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP, approved 4/26/21, was developed as a result of the 4/15/21 renewal\nevaluation. The agency had violations regarding FTMs, USP approval, and\nparticipation in development of service plans. During this review the agency had one\nrepeat violation regarding FTMs. Overall, the agency had more violations during this\nreview than the previous year. However, the Chief Administrator reported being\naware of the root cause and indicated confidence in developing an effective CAP to\naddress these areas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed with Chief\nAdministrator (CA) at the entrance meeting. CA acknowledged some difficulty this\npast year with meeting timeframes for treatment plan signatures, medical passport\nsignatures, home visits within the first five days of placement, and difficulty with\nparents not attending parenting time. Some of these issues were a result of COVID\nrestrictions over the past year. While others were due to inconsistent staffing and\nturnover. CA anticipates there will be improvement in the next year as they have\nbecome more accustom to process changes that occurred during COVID. In\naddition, the agency staffing has become more stable.\n7",
    "Interview\nTwo agency staff were interviewed. One staff was new to the agency and the other\nhad approximately one year experience there. Both staff reported being happy in\ntheir positions and feeling their co-workers were helpful. Both staff stated their\nsupervisors were supportive and knowledgeable. Neither staff had any concerns\nabout the agency.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST\nThe DCWL Analyst identified two safety concerns as follows:\nSafety Alert 1: The DCWL analyst attempted a scheduled visit to the home on\n5/16/22, but no one answered the door. Phone calls and texts were attempted, with\nno response from the caregiver.\nResolution 1: The caregiver took the child to the agency on 5/17/22 for parenting\ntime. The worker observed the child and verified his well-being. The worker also\nvisited the child in the caregiver’s home on 6/2/22. No concerns were noted about the\nhome.\nSafety Alert 2: The relative caregiver was not responsive to several requests by the\nDCWL Analyst to schedule a visit in April 2022.\nResolution 2: The caseworker visited the home on 4/28/22 to verify the children’s\nwell-being. No concerns were noted about the home.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n_ _______________May 12, 2022____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 6, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
