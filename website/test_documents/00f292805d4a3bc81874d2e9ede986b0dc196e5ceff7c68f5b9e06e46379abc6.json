DCWL Analyst Findings:\nOne foster family did not receive monthly case manager visits for the months of\nFebruary, March, and April 2017.\nResponse: Foster home visits are documented as occurring on 2/6/17 @ 9 pm\n(scheduled), 3/27/17 @ 7:30 (unannounced), 4/12/17 @ 3:45 pm (scheduled).\nThe following concerns were noted for the same foster case:\nThe biological dad states he:\n was not given the opportunity to give input into the service plan and therefore\nhas not signed the service plan.\n has not been invited to attend a Family Team Meeting\n does not feel the agency is supportive of his mental health needs.\n has not had monthly contact with the assigned case manager.\n has not had quarterly in home visits by the assigned case manager.\n is offered weekly parenting time at DHHS. He has mental health issues that\nwon’t allow him to spend one hour in a small room. The case manager won’t\naccommodate his needs so that he can participate in visits with his children.\n is not involved in medical decisions for one of his children. He disagrees with the\nmedications being given to his son.\n cannot participate in medical or educational appointments for 2 of his children in\nout of county placement. Transportation is a barrier.\n is not notified of medical or educational appointments for his children.\n was not notified of the placement of his children into foster care timely.\nResponse: He has been a non-participating member since the onset of the case.\nHe has never attended a Court hearing or FTM. He does not have a stable\nresidence; efforts were made to visit him at various addresses, but he was no\nlonger living at any of them. The Court did order the birth mother to provide an\naddress for him at one point during the case. He did attend the children’s initial\nmedical appointment, as well as some sporadic parenting time appointments in\nthe beginning of the case. He has documented mental health concerns (he is\ndiagnosed with Bipolar disorder and Schizophrenia), as well as a history of\ndomestic violence and threatening workers. There is a “Safety Hazard” in the\nMiSACWIS system regarding him given his explosive nature and the fact that he\nstated he is not taking his prescribed psychotropic medication. Given this safety\n20",
    "issue, his parenting time must be held at DHHS to protect the children as well as\nthe assigned worker. Monthly contacts are made with him regarding his\ninvolvement with the case plan as well as the parenting time schedule. His\nresponses to these contacts is argumentative, threatening, and inappropriate. He\nis encouraged to contact his court appointed attorney and appear at Court\nhearings. His Parent Agency Treatment Plan is mailed to the last known address\nwe have for him. Workers have attempted to complete home visits at his last\nknown address, but have been unsuccessful (documented in MiSACWIS\nincluding but not limited to 4/13/17 & 6/21/17). It should be noted that he was also\nnot involved with case planning the first time his children were in foster care in\n2012-2013.\nThe biological mother states she:\n is not involved in educational decisions for 2 of her children due to an out of\ncounty placement. Transportation is a barrier.\n is concerned that the staff turnover has impacted the length of the case.\nResponse: Biological mother was informed of all school meetings and medical\nappointments for the children; arrangements were made to allow her to\nparticipate in these events via telephone if she was unable to attend in person.\nThe worker changes did not affect the length of the case at all; in fact it was\nbeneficial to the case, as each worker provided a “new set of eyes” and made\nobservations regarding the home conditions\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n1/18/18\n________________________________________\nVenus M.
