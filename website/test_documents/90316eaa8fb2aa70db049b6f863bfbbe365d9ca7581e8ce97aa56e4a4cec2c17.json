    "Spoke with Foster Care Supervisor 3\n11/22/2021 Contact-Telephone call made\nSpoke with Chief Administrator 1\n11/22/2021 Inspection completed- Sub Compliance\n11/22/2021 Contact- Telephone call made\nPreliminary Finding provided to Chief Administrator 1\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency has not completed the children’s adoption timely. An expedited consent\nfor adoption was requested in April 2021. The request was returned for rework on\n6/1/2021 and the rework has not been completed. Due to the adoption taking nearly\ntwo years to occur, one of the children has aged out of foster care prior to being\nadopted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 10/5/2021 I reviewed the allegations in the complaint.\nOn 10/6/2021 I spoke with Complainant X related to the allegations by telephone.\nComplainant X confirmed the allegations in the complaint. Complainant X reported\nthe DD children have been under Spectrum’s care since 11/21/2019. The children\nbecame permanent wards of the state, with a plan of adoption shortly after Spectrum\ntook responsibility for the case. The children have never had a placement change.\nThey remained in the care of an aunt, who wishes to adopt them. Almost two years\nlater, Spectrum has yet to complete the children’s adoption. The Complainant X\nreported due to Spectrum’s delayed work on this case one of the children has aged\nout of the system without the permanency of adoption. The other children’s\nadoptions are held up due to a lack of follow up actions from the agency. The\nagency requested an expedited consent request for the children’s adoption in April\nof this year. The consent request was sent back to Spectrum for needed rework on\n6/1/2021. As 9/21/2021 the agency had yet to complete that rework to move the\nadoption forward. They finally submitted the rework on 10/1/2021.\nComplainant X reported this complaint is the first concern being expressed related\nto the agency. The case was previously under Oakland County Department of\nHealth and Human Services (DHHS) and Complainant X is not aware of any\nconcerns from that entity. Complainant X reported after expressed concerns and\nfrustration by the court with the lack of adoption progress, Lapeer County DHHS\nconducted a case review and discovered these complaint issues and concern\nrelated to reports and system upload issues. A meeting was held with Spectrum’s\nadministrative staff on 9/23/2021. The agency did not have an excuse or explanation\nfor the delays and lack of work. They just reported they would look into the matter.\nOn 10/22/2021, I interviewed Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) 2 related to the\nallegations by telephone. FCS 2 reported employment with agency in February of\n2021. She was assigned supervisory responsibilities for the DD Children’s adoptive\n5",
    "case in April 2021. She also served as the adoption case worker for the case from\nApril 2021. A contractual worker had been assigned to the case prior to FCS 2. FCS\n2 reported they were trying to get the children’s adoptions completed before Child A\nturned 18. FCS 2 believed all adoption paperwork was in place prior to her\nassignment to the case. As to the problem with the MCI consent request being\nreturned for rework, FCS 2 reported believing there was an issue with the DHS-3130\nneeding to be corrected and some children protective services issues or\ndocumentation getting taken care of which took a long time. She said the contract\nworker was charged with completing the adoption evaluation; and was to stay in\ncontact with she and Administrator 1 on getting the children’s adoption completed.\nThe contractual worker left the agency, and the agency had to assess what was still\nneeded related to the adoption. FCS 2 was not sure whether she was still\nresponsible for the case, but reported they have since requested consent and are\nawaiting its approval.\nOn 10/25/2021, I interviewed FCS 3 by telephone related to the allegations. She is\nthe current foster care supervisor. Prior to her current role, she was the foster care\nworker, not the adoption worker. She did not provide information related to the\nadoption delay concerns.\nOn 11/22/2021, I spoke with Chief Administrator 1 about my preliminary special\ninvestigation findings. I also advised her the original and recent MCI consent request\ndocumentations were not uploaded into MISACWIS. Additionally, the family’s initial\nadoption evaluation report is dated for 9/30/2021 and how was that when the agency\nrequested expedited consent in April 2021. Chief Administrator 1 advised the\n9/30/2021 family adoption evaluation date is correct. She reported the worker did not\ncomplete the family’s adoption evaluation report back in April. The worker apparently\nsent paperwork to MCI without a family adoption evaluation report, which was a part\nof the problem. Whatever consent paperwork the worker put together or may have\nsubmitted to MCI is not available. Thus, MCI consent was not actually requested\nback in April 2021.\nReviewed:\nThe MISACWIS record for Adoptive Parent E that showed:\n An Initial Adoption Evaluation (DHS-3130) for Adoptive Parent E shows with a\nrecommendation date of 3/30/2021 and a supervisory approval date as pending.\nThe report generates as a DRAFT document and is not complete.\n An Initial Family Adoption Evaluation report for Adoptive Parent E dated\n9/30/2021; and DHS-612 Adoptive Family Assessment Addendum - Criminal\nHistory report dated 10/1/2021.\nThe DD Children’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n Spectrum accepted the children’s cases on 11/21/2019. Child A (age 18) was\nmade a Michigan Children’s Institute (MCI) ward on 11/21/2019. Child B (age\n15) and Child C (age 11) were made MCI wards on 12/18/2019.\n6",
    " The three children were placed in Adoptive Parent E’s home on 9/19/2019\nand remain in that placement.\n No documentation related to when MCI consent was first requested or what\nproblems occurred.\n Documentation indicating the agency continues to pursue Child A’s adoption.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\nANALYSIS: The agency took acceptance of the children’s adoption case in\nNovember and December of 2019. The agency staff did not put\nforth efforts to timely process the children’s adoptions. The staff\nlost sight of the status of the adoptions, whether adoption\nconsent was requested as alleged and whether the contractual\nworker had completed the family’s adoption evaluation back in\nMarch or April of 2021. The family’s adoption evaluation was not\ncompleted until 9/30/2021.\nIn this instance, the agency did not provide direct and effective\nefforts related to working with relevant individuals towards\ncompletion of the children’s service plan/permanency goal.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nFamily Team Meetings (FTMs) have not been completed as required. There are\nseveral missing in the system.\nSemi-annul transition meetings have not been completed as required.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 10/6/2021 I spoke with Complainant X related to the allegations by telephone.\nComplainant X confirmed the information in the complaint related to there being\nmultiple missing reports or required documents or signatures for service plans, and\nmissing family team meetings. Complainant X reported there have been three foster\ncare supervisors and two workers assigned to the DD Children’s case, but there is\nnot a primary adoption worker.\n7",
    "On 10/22/2021, I interviewed FCS 2 related to the allegations by telephone. FCS 2\nreported not being sure why there would not be family team meeting completed. She\nreported only being involved in one for September 2021.\nOn 10/25/2021, I interviewed FCS 3 by telephone related to the allegations. FCS 3\nreported being the foster care worker (FCW) on the case prior to her current\nsupervisory role. She served as the FCW from March 2020 until June 2021 when\nFCW 4 became the FCW. The case has since transferred to FCW 5 as of\nSeptember 2021. FCS 3 reported as the FCW on the case she completed the work.\nShe admitted it was true that many reports may not have been uploaded to\nMISACWIS; and she has corrected much of that as of 9/27/2021. She reported she\nand FCW 5 would be working to ensure all services are linked. She was not sure\nwhy the work may not have been done prior to her assignment to the case. She has\nonly been the supervisor since June 2021.\nFCS 3 reported FTM, Semi-annual transition plan meetings and service plans were\ncompleted timely but not uploaded. She reported COVID issues impacted on her\nuploading of documents.\nReviewed\nThe DD Children’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n Information as listed earlier.\n FTMs documented for service plans reviews for July 2020- Sept 2021.\n Semi-annual transition plan meeting documents for 7/20/2020, 12/22/2020\nand 10/8/2021.
