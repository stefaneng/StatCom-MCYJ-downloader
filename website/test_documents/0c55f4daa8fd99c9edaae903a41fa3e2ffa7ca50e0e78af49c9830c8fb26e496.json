    "summary": "The investigation examined allegations that a staff member (Staff 1) at Osceola Youth Center pursued an inappropriate relationship with a resident (Youth A). While the specific allegation of a romantic relationship was not substantiated, the investigation found that Staff 1 was terminated for coming to work under the influence of marijuana, exhibited unprofessional behavior including poor boundaries and inappropriate language, and failed to meet the required ability to perform his duties. Additionally, a separate violation was substantiated because another staff member (Staff 4) failed to report a resident's statement about having sex with Staff 1 in a facility van as required by child protection policy. Overall culpability for the violations lies with both the individual staff members for their misconduct and the facility administration for systemic failures in oversight and reporting.",
