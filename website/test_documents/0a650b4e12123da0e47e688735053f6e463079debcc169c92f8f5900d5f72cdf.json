    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection\nDescription (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iii)Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or otherwise\nsuggesting physical or emotional harm to a youth.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff verbally threatened a youth.\nInvestigation I notified Foster Care Worker that I was assigned this\ninvestigation. She expressed no additional concerns regarding\nthe facility.\nI notified Rights Officer of the allegation.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing rule violations.\nI interviewed Complainant, who is a staff member, with Rights\nOfficer present on 6/13/23. She has worked at the facility for over\nfour years. On 6/9/23, Complainant said she heard and saw\nYouth C cussing at Team Leader and grab Team Leader’s arm.\nTeam Leader pulled her arm away. Youth C warned Team\nLeader, “Run up, get done up,” meaning she challenged Team\nLeader to a fight. Team Leader responded back to Youth C, “Run\nup, get done up. This job doesn’t pay me enough fucking money.”\nThen Team Leader exited the building.\nI interviewed Youth C with Rights Officer present. She said Team\nLeader walked her from school to Beata Hall and “buddied” her\n“hard.” Vista Maria utilizes a “buddy system” which involves youth\ninterlocking arms with staff or another youth when moving one\nbuilding to another. “I grabbed Team Leader’s arm. We buddied.\nTeam Leader told my supervisor. I showed Supervisor what\nTeam Leader did to my arm. I approached Team Leader and\nyelled. Team Leader said, ‘Run up, get done up. I don’t care\nabout this job.’” Supervisor and Complainant had to hold both of\nus back.” Then Complainant escorted Team Leader out of the\nbuilding.\n2",
    "I interviewed Supervisor on 6/15/23 with Rights Officer present.\nShe has worked at the facility for 13 years. Supervisor said she\nheard Youth C and Team Leader “going back and forth.” Team\nLeader let her know Youth C had snatched her arm away from her\nwhile transporting to the building. Youth C grabbed Team\nLeader’s arm to demonstrate to Supervisor how Team Leader\nbuddied her. Team Leader told Youth C not to touch her. “I got\nbetween Youth C and Team Leader so Team Leader could walk\naway. Team Leader said “Run up, get done up. This job doesn’t\npay enough to deal with this.” Supervisor said Team Leader\nshowed no signs of aggression toward Youth C.\nI interviewed Team Leader on 6/22/23. She has worked at the\nfacility over 12 years, usually works in another building and said\nshe had no contact with Youth C since the incident. There were\nno disciplinary write-ups in Team Leader’s personnel file.\nOn the day of this incident, Team Leader said she was helping out\nat the school when school staff asked her to transport Youth C to\nBeata Hall. “When I scooped my arm in to ‘buddy,’ Youth C\nsnatched her arm away. She got loud and was cussing. I asked\nher to buddy with another resident, but she refused. I said, “We\ncan’t go then.” Youth C reluctantly agreed to “buddy” with me.\n“On the way to Beata, Youth C was physically resistant, pulling on\nme. I asked her to stop. She continued. Outside Beata’s door,\nYouth C yanked her left arm away and elbowed me in the chest.\nWe entered the foyer. I talked to Supervisor. Youth C came to\nthe office door protesting and arguing. Youth C grabbed my right\narm. I yanked it and told her not to touch or grab me. She said,\n‘Get your finger out of my face.’ Youth C made a sudden\nmovement causing me to flinch. I was already around the corner\nand said, ‘Please don’t run up or you’ll end up getting done up.’”\nI asked Team Leader what she meant by that statement. She\nsaid she meant she would “protect herself.” Team Leader denied\ncursing and recognized how her statement could be viewed as\nthreatening. She apologized for her response and said she has\nbeen assaulted by youths on four different occasions. “I got\nsucked in,” she admitted.\nAnalysis Team Leader admitted she verbally responded to Youth C in a\nthreatening manner.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000229 intake 2/8/23, CAP approved 3/23/23\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJune 28, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 5, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"

    "summary": "A staff Team Leader at Vista Maria verbally threatened a youth during a confrontation, telling the youth 'Run up, get done up' and making a statement about the job not paying enough, which constituted a prohibited intervention. The investigation, which included interviews with the youth, complainant, supervisor, and the Team Leader herself, substantiated the allegation, and the Team Leader admitted her statement could be viewed as threatening. This was a repeat violation of rules against threats of harm, indicating a failure of prior corrective actions to ensure compliance.",
