    "MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES\nOFFICE OF CHILDREN AND ADULT LICENSING\nADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL LICENSING STUDY REPORT\nI. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\nLicense #: CE090200968\nLicensee Name: Bay County\nLicensee Address: 515 Center\nBay City, MI 48708\nLicensee Telephone #:\nAdministrator/Licensee Designee: Thomas Tonkavich, Administrator\nName of Facility: Bay County Juvenile Home\nFacility Address: 520 W Hampton Road\nEssexville, MI 48732\nFacility Telephone #: (989) 892-4519\nCapacity: 30\nProgram Type: CHILD CARING INSTITUTION,\nGOVERNMENT - NON-FIA\n1",
    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe Licensee has requested to add residential treatment to the type of services\nprovided at this facility. The request is for 12 beds to be designated as treatment\nand reduce the number of short-term beds to 18 to maintain the current capacity of\n30 residents for this facility.\nIII. Methodology\n07/28/2005 Onsite visit and review of the facility.\n08/12/2005 Consultation meeting with facility representatives and contracted\nservices representatives.\n09/27/2005 Received draft of program statement for treatment services.\n11/29/2005 Received request for modification of terms for the license and the\nfinalized Program Statement and related materials for treatment\nservices.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nOn 7/28/2005 this consultant visited this facility and concluded that the facility was\nproviding treatment services in a secure setting as well as short-term placement\nservices. The licensee has developed appropriate program statements and\ndescription of services to add treatment services as a term to this license.\nThis modification request does not change the total placement capacity of this facility\nso it does have sufficient and proper space to provide the treatment services.\nSince the total capacity is not changed by this request the facility continues to have\nadequate staff to accommodate the inclusion of treatment services for some of the\nidentified residents. The treatment services are provided through other appropriate\npersonnel on a contracted basis with the facility staff maintaining supervisory\nresponsibility for the residents. This arrangement allows the facility to appropriately\nprovide these additional treatment services.\nV. Recommendation\nThis consultant recommends the modification of this license to include treatment\nservices in a secure setting.\n________________________________________\nMark R.
