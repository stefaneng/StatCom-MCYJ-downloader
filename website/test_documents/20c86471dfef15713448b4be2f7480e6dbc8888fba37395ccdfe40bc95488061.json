    "03/24/2022 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\n3/24/22 Preliminary Exit\n5/19/22 Exit\nALLEGATION: Youth A was restrained outside of the restraint\nprocedures. Youth A did not have any marks or bruises.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A has been discharged from the facility.\nI spoke to Administrator 1 on 2/16/22. Administrator 1 reported that Staff 1 completed a\nrestraint that was outside of the MACH restraint module. Administrator 1 reported Staff\n1 did a “chicken hold”, where he held Youth A’s arms from behind her. Administrator 1\nreported there is not a MACH manual, procedural book, or documents in their\npossession that show or describe the MACH restraint module.\nI reviewed the video footage and Staff 1 did hold Youth A’s arms from behind her. Staff\n2 was at the incident but did not engage in the restraint.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 3/22/22. Staff 1 reported Youth A was brought into the facility by\nher grandmother. Youth A entered a non-secure area and was attempting to leave the\nfacility. Once she entered the secure area, Youth A began to verbally escalate and\nattempted to run out the door. Staff1 reported at that time, he grabbed her arms and\nheld her. Staff 1 reported he was trying to do a MACH 3-Team Control hold but couldn’t\ndo it because there needs to be two staff members completing this technique. Staff 2\nwas present but was not engaged in the physical restraint. Staff 1 reported his\ntechnique was not consistent with MACH training.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 3/22/22. Staff 2 reported Youth A was screaming, cussing, and\nstarting to get aggressive. Staff 2 reported Youth A did make threats. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 grabbed her arms and she verbally deescalated her. Staff 2 reported that most\nrestraints are initiated with one staff until the other staff can get to the area. Staff 2\nreported she did not step in because she was able to verbally deescalate Youth A while\nStaff 1 held Youth A. Staff 2 reported that Staff 1 was not overtly aggressive, and she\nfelt that Staff 1 made a good decision to hold her while she deescalated Youth A.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 on 3/24/22. Supervisor 1 is the MACH trainer. Supervisor 1\nreported he does not have a MACH training manual, procedural book, or documents in\nhis possession that show or describe the MACH restraint module. Supervisor 1 reported\nthat it is easier to show the MACH restraint module than to verbally describe it. I\nattempted to “google” MACH module and did not find this module. Supervisor 1\nreported that the manual is not online and that the only MACH training that I would see\n3",
    "(online) is the military training. Supervisor 1 reported that a restraint is conducted when\na youth is a threat to others or themselves, if they corner staff, advance towards staff or\nthrowing objects that could potentially hurt others. Supervisor 1 reported he attends\ntraining for MACH and then trains others at the facility but stated there are no manuals\nor procedures written down for the actual restraint techniques. Supervisor 1 reported\nthat there are no MACH techniques that would have you hold a child from behind them.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand\nprocedures regarding restraint. These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their families,\nand referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: Based upon interview with Supervisor 1, the hold that Staff 1\ncompleted was not part of MACH training. Staff 1 reported that\nhe did not follow MACH protocol as well.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand\nprocedures regarding restraint. These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their families,\nand referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: Both Administrator 1 and Supervisor 1 reported there are no\nwritten procedures for the MACH training module.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nA. It is recommended that the license remain unchanged.\n4",
