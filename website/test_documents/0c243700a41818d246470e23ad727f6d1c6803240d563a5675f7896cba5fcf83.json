    "One of two new hire employees’ files reviewed where a six-month evaluation was\nrequired, lacked a completed evaluation.\nRepeat Violation Established\n2021 Renewal, CAP approved 9/14/21\nR 400.4125 Personal possessions; money; clothing; storage space.\n(1) A licensee shall have a written policy that designates all\nof the following:\n(b) The method used to accurately account for and\nreturn possessions and money to the resident or guardian\nupon discharge.\nOne of three open youth files reviewed lacked documentation of a clothing inventory.\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(3) The licensee shall document that each staff person\nwhose function is covered by these rules has participated\nin a minimum of 50 clock hours of planning training within\nthe first year of employment and a minimum of 25 clock\nhours of training annually thereafter related to the\nemployee's job function.

Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the following:\n2",
    "This facility is non-contracted with Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices therefore, MISEP requirements are not applicable.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract/Policy violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included\nin section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements except for the following:\nThis facility is non-contracted with Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices, therefore, MDHHS Policy/MDHHS contract are not applicable.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n If a youth refuses to attend a medical appointment, that should be documented\non the medical refusal form.\n The agency has multiple case records containing youth information, it is\nrecommended that youth have one uniform file per the licensing rule.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n Youth who have the capacity to understand should be provided with the\ntreatment plan and sign off.\n Be consistent with completing all required reports for each youth.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period in response to their 2021 Renewal\nInspection Report. There were three violations, one of which is a repeat violation\nduring this inspection for employee performance evaluations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted that there have been no unplanned discharges of\nchildren since the last inspection. CA noted that since the last review, there have\nbeen no barriers or systemic factors that have impacted rule compliance. As a part of\nthe approved CAP based on the 2021 Renewal Inspection Report, the facility\nimplemented a \"buddy\" system wherein a designated \"buddy\" supervisor from\nanother program was required to sign off on the pre-hire checklist before an offer of\nemployment was made. The facility also requested HR send an automated reminder\nthrough their online system Cornerstone to ensure performance reviews were\ncompleted timely & CA noted this process produced results. CA reported that review\nof employee files on \"Annual Days\" in collaboration with HR personnel has proven\n3",
    "effective in having updated driver's licenses for all employees. These processes were\nintended to provide additional oversight to ensure compliance with R400.4113. CA\nidentified R400.12205 Required Staff as a rule that needs improvement and noted\nthat the goal is to become fully staffed by enhancing recruitment efforts. The facility\nplans to partner with HR, beginning 8/31/22, and finance to offer cash incentives for\nemployees to recruit friends, strategize ways to attract qualified candidates/increase\ncandidate pool and partner with local colleges and universities to recruit talented\ngraduates.\nInterviews\nOne youth reported that everything was going well, and he liked living there. He did\nindicate there are no good trash cans in the facility and there are a lot of flies in the\nhome, specifically in the kitchen. Another youth noted that he did not like living in the\nfacility, wants more money and wants to go on outings. However, in talking with staff,\nthe youth is not participating in programming as required and therefore has not\nearned additional privileges.\nStaff interviews were very positive. All staff interviewed reported enjoying working for\nBethany Christian Services and enjoyed their roles at Casa Del Sol. One staff stated\nthe only concern was not knowing who is filling in each of the management roles as a\nsupervisor has been out on extended medical leave. The staff noted that it gets\nconfusing which supervisor to consult with for each purpose and it does not seem to\nbe clearly laid out. The staff also noted that there is not a lot of privacy for direct case\nmanagers to complete their work and print documents. However, the staff also\nreported they felt heard and supported regarding that need as the organization is\nworking on cleaning out the back office and installing an additional printer to\naccommodate.\n4",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility continue their regular license.\n7/29/2022\n__________________________\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
