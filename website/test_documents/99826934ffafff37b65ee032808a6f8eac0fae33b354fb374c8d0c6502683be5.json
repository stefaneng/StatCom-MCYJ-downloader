    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules except\nfor the following:\nR 400.12712 Supervision.\n(1) An agency shall provide post-placement supervisory\nvisits for the adoptive family at the adoptive parent's\nhome as needed to assure the safety and well being\nof the child, but not less than once every month, after\nthe placement of a child and until the final order of\nadoption.\nTwo of two files reviewed of families with post-placement adoption supervision\nrequirements did not contain documentation of all of the required monthly visits.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTechnical assistance was provided regarding obtaining copies of adoption\nfinalization orders as one file reviewed did not contain this information making it\nimpossible to determine when post-placement visit requirements ended.\nV. CONSULTATION\nConsultation was provided regarding the need to continue to utilize the licensing rule\nbook for agency compliance as the director was informed by another agency director\nthat the rule book was no longer applicable and to use the Public Act 116 book\nsolely.\n4",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted no acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThere have been no changes to the policies or requirements of the agency during\nthe period under review. The staff interviewed did not report any concerns.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility continue on a regular license.\nHolly K. Austin\nFebruary 18, 2020\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 29, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
