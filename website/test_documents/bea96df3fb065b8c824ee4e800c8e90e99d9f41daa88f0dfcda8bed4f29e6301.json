    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Sufficiency of staff.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency's program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that Youth A and Youth B have been engaging in\ninappropriate and possible sexual relationship while at the facility.\nThey have written letters to each other describing the relationship\nand these were recently found.\nInvestigation I spoke to Administrator on 9/17/24; no new information was\nprovided.\nI left a voicemail for Complainant on 9/17/24. A return call was\nnot completed.\nI spoke to DHHS Worker on 9/17/24. Allegations were discussed.\nI contacted Foster Care Worker on 10/10/24. No new information\nwas provided.\nInterviews were conducted on 9/20/24 at the facility.\nYouth B reported he does not have a sexual relationship with\nYouth A. Youth B reported he has hugged Youth A and has\ntouched her leg when he has talked to her. Youth B reported the\nunits do outside recreation together and they were able to be near\neach other. Youth B reported they were able to sit together at the\npicnic table and he touched her leg under the table once. Youth B\nreported staff were present, they just didn’t see him do this. Youth\nB reported he will verbally flirt with her, but they are not an “item.”\nYouth B reported they both have written letters to each other.\nYouth B reported they have passed the letters by giving them to\nother individuals to hand to each other. Youth B reported males\nand females are not separate in school, so he was able to pass\n2",
    "letters this way. They also used to have cafeteria meals together.\nYouth B reported the cafeteria meals has been changed and now\nmeals are done by units; therefore, males and females are\nseparate. Youth B reported there was always a staff member in\naddition to the teacher in the classroom. Youth B reported they\ndidn’t see them pass the notes. Youth B reported there were\nalways staff in the cafeteria as well. Youth B reported sometimes\nhe would drop letters on the ground if he knew Youth A was\nbehind him in class or in line and she would know to grab it. Youth\nB reported when they AWOLed together, Youth A would grab his\ngroin area over his clothes, and he would grab her butt over her\nclothes. Youth B reported they have kissed when they AWOLed\nbut did not engage in sexual intercourse. On 9/16/24, after their\nAWOL, Supervisor 3 spoke to him about his decisions pertaining\nto AWOL and questioning him concerning Youth A. After this\nAWOL, staff in the unit made them keep their distance during\noutside activities. Youth B reported no one knew they were\n“talking” to each other.\nYouth A reported her, and Youth B have never touched each\nother. Youth A reported they AWOLed four days ago (9/16/24)\nand during that AWOL there was no touching either. Youth A\nreported she would give written letters by handing them to him.\nYouth A reported staff were always present but didn’t see this\nhappen. Youth A reported she is 13 years of age and Youth B is\n17 years of age and she does not want him to get into trouble, so\nthey never touched each other. Youth A would not discuss\nanything further.\nSupervisor 1 is the supervisor for Youth A’s unit. Supervisor 1\nreported Youth A does attempt to gain attention from the male\nyouth in the building. Supervisor 1 reported she was unaware of\nany involvement of Youth A and Youth B though. Supervisor 1\nreported she thought Youth A was interested in a different male\npeer and she was keeping an eye on this. Supervisor 1 reported\non 9/10/24, there was heightened supervision on Youth A. This\nwas due to Youth A showing an outward interest in male youth.\nThe interventions they put into place were to separate the units\nduring lunch time, separation from males in the school classroom,\nand staff specifically monitoring Youth A in the Youth Council\nProgram. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A did not know staff were\nsupervising her, but the staff understood this to be their role.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth B had AWOLed with Youth A on\n9/16/24 and then afterwards, they found the letters in a room\nsearch. Supervisor 1 reported they never saw Youth A and Youth\nB touching in any way.\n3",
    "Supervisor 2 is the supervisor for Youth B’s unit. Supervisor 2\nreported Youth B is not involved in many issues. Youth B tends to\nlisten to instructions and is respectful to staff and peers.\nSupervisor 2 reported they were not aware of any relationship until\nafter Youth A and Youth B AWOLed together on 9/16/24. After the\nAWOL, they completed a room check for Youth A and Youth B\nand found numerous letters under the dresser. Supervisor 2\nreported no one had seen any touching or letter passing between\nYouth A and Youth B.\nSupervisor 3 is a facility supervisor. Supervisor 3 reported she\nthought Youth A had a crush on Youth B, but that was it.\nSupervisor 3 reported she has brought this up to Youth B as to\nwarn him to keep his distance from her, but never saw Youth B\ninteract with her in an inappropriate manner. Supervisor 3\nreported they AWOLed recently and that is when they found out\nthere were letters written back and forth.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident Report dated 9/16/24. The incident report\ndocumented an AWOL with Youth A and several other\npeers. As they were AWOLing, “Youth B was very\ninappropriate with touching, play fighting, holding hands,\nand boundary lines.” The incident report noted they were\nredirected many times but did not listen. They left the\ngrounds together hugging and in close proximity to one\nanother along with other peers. When they were AWOL\nstaff searched all the youth’s bedroom and found letters in\nYouth A and Youth B’s bedrooms.\n• I reviewed the letters between Youth A and Youth B. There\nare no dates on the letters. Physical touch was mentioned\nin the form of hugs and sitting next to each other. There\nwas not a specific reference to sexual activity that occurred,\nonly what Youth A wanted to happen sexually.\nAnalysis Based on all interviews, there is no evidence to suggest staff were\nnot present or not supervising youth.\n• There is also no evidence to validate staff knew there was\na relationship and did not intervene to provide protection\nand supervision.\n• Staff are not accountable for youth’s behavior when they\nare considered AWOL.\n• Interventions were in place for Youth A, but not due to a\nrelationship with Youth B. Youth A has a tendency to\n4",
    "initiate relationships with the males in the building. Because\nof this, the agency had already put interventions in place to\ncurb this behavior.\n• Room checks were completed while youth were AWOL and\nletters were discovered at that time.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/10/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
