    "DHHS Worker reported, during a phone conference held on\n3/9/2023, there was a preponderance of evidence and Staff 1 will\nhave a confirmed case.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Searches and Prohibited Items Policy which indicates that\nillegal drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol are prohibited in the\nhome and that, if staff believe a resident is in possession of\na prohibited item, they should immediately inform their\nsupervisor in writing and document in shift notes.\n• Supervision notes from 1/30/2023 documenting that Staff 1\nreported having seen a youth smoking a “weed like device”\nduring life skills training.

Supervisor\nreminded Staff 1 of the protocol to report these items to\nFoster Care Worker and Supervisor.\n• Notes from Foster Care Worker indicating that she spoke to\nYouth C in her room on 1/18/2023 at which time Youth C\ndenied being allowed to smoke/vape in the home.\n• Screenshot of a text message provided by a former youth\nto Foster Care Worker including the following text:\nYouth A “So did [Staff 1] not tell us it was okay to\nsmoke in the house as long as it doesn’t smell like\nweed when [Foster Care Worker] gets there? Or just\nthe fact that she knows cause she whole is trying to\nsay [Youth B’s] out for her and [my sister] is lying.”\nYouth C “Like tf”\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as a staff member did not\ndemonstrate the required ability by allowing youths to have vapes\nin the home, not following policy by failing to report vapes when\nobserved and violating policy by bringing youth along to transport\nher own child, inviting youth to spend holidays with her family and\nallowing at least one youth into her home. Additionally, Staff 1 has\na confirmed case.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2022C0112005 4/15/2022, CAP Approved 5/4/2022\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n7",
