    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this\nrule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of human\nservices, the equivalent state or Canadian provincial agency, or\nequivalent agency in the country where the person usually\nresides, that the person has not been determined to be a\nperpetrator of child abuse or child neglect. The documentation\nshall be completed not more than 30 days prior to the start of\nemployment and every 12 months thereafter.\nTwo of nine employee files reviewed lacked documentation of verification the\nemployee has not been determined to be a perpetrator of child abuse or neglect as\nrequired. In one case the new hire employee check was completed in May 2020 but\nwas not hired until September exceeding the 30-day time frame prior to employment.\nThe second case, an employee had a check completed in 2018 and 2020 but not in\n2019.\nR 400.4114 Tuberculosis screening for employees and volunteers.\nThe licensee shall document, prior to employment, that each\nemployee and volunteer who has contact with residents 4 or\nmore hours per week for more than 2 consecutive weeks is free\nfrom communicable tuberculosis. Freedom from communicable\ntuberculosis shall be verified within the 1-year period before\nemployment and shall be verified every 1 year after the last\nverification or prior to the expiration of the current verification.\nThree of three employee files reviewed where the employee was employed for over\na year lacked documentation of verification of freedom of tuberculosis every one\nyear as required. It was noted in all three cases a screening checklist was completed\nin accordance with the Communication Issuance 20-062, however a tuberculosis\nscreening test was never administrated when they became available again as\nrequired.\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(1) The licensee shall provide an orientation program for new\nemployees.\nJob shadowing shall not be the only form of orientation. The\norientation shall include the following:\n1",
    "(a) The institution's purpose, policies, and procedures,\nincluding discipline, crisis intervention techniques, and\nemergency and safety procedures.\nSix of six new hire employee files reviewed lacked documentation that 16 hours of\norientation covering the required topics was provided to the employee prior to the\nassumption of their job duties as required.\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(3) The licensee shall document that each staff person whose\nfunction is covered by these rules has participated in a minimum\nof 50 clock hours of planned training within the first year of\nemployment and a minimum of 25 clock hours of training\nannually thereafter related to the employee’s job function. At\nleast 16 of the 50 hours provided in the first year shall be\norientation provided prior to the assumption of duties.\nTwo of three employee files reviewed where the employee worked for the facility\nover one year did not completed 25 hours of annual training as required.\nR 400.4153 Shelter care and detention institutions; preliminary service\nplans.\nWithin 7 calendar days of admission, a plan shall be developed\nfor each resident. The plan shall include all of the following:\n(a) The reason for care.\n(b) An assessment of the resident’s immediate and specific\nneeds.\n(c) The specific services to be provided by the institution.\n(d) Other resources to meet the resident’s needs.\nOne of three youth files reviewed did not have a preliminary service plan completed\nwithin 7 calendar days of admission as required.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the following:\nThis facility does not serve plaintiff class youth.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract/Policy violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included\nin section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements except for the following:\nThis facility is not contracted with MDHHS.\n2",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Provided suggestions on documentation of 16 hours of orientation to include a\nform that includes date of hire, date of assuming job responsibilities with list of\nrequired training topics and signatures.\n Provided guidance on file completion as many items were not located in the file\nfor review and needed to be obtain from elsewhere. Files should be complete\nand have all items needed as required.\n The Office manager and consultant reviewed the licensing rules and a link to\nthe electronic child caring institution rules was provided to the office manager\nfor review as he is responsible for the contents of the employee files.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not in need of consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has not been required to submit any corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nI toured the facility during the unannounced onsite inspection. Both the second and\nthird floor locations were observed to be clean in all areas with no noted safety\nconcerns. The meal menu was posted in the cafeteria. All medications were locked\nin a medication cart behind two locked doors. Youth were not present onsite when I\narrived as they were offsite at a school utilizing the gym. When they returned, they\nparticipated in school in the classroom located on the first floor. During interviews with\nyouth, they reported feeling safe at Bridgeway and liking everything about the\nprogram thus far. Youth stated staff are supervising them throughout the day and they\nare checked on at night at least every 15 minutes. The facility reported a staffing\nshortage throughout the last year that has kept their census lower than their 36-youth\ncapacity. Staff interviews stated that although youth are safe, there are times due to\nstaffing shortages staff are not always in a safe position being left alone with youth or\nnot speaking the same language as the youth due to staff from other programs filling\nin open shifts. During this inspection, multiple employee file non-compliances were\nfound, one being directly related to COVID 19. The facility reported the employee\nhiring process has changed and the office manager was now in charge of this for the\nfirst time this year.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n3",
    "Based on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility continue their regular license.\nMarch 10, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 11, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
