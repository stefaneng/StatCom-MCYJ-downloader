    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nWolverine Aftercare has moved their satellite office in Warren from 11885 E. 12\nMile Rd to 14049 E. 13 Mile Rd. The main office is in Taylor. Other satellite\noffices are located in Bloomfield Hills and Flint.\nIII. Methodology\nA virtual tour of this office was conducted on 2/9/18.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe office is a free-standing newly-constructed building. There is adequate staff,\nvisitor and handicapped parking available. There is a reception area, lobby, visitor\nrestrooms and emergency exit doors. Past the reception area, there is a secure\ndoor leading to a long hallway.\nThe hallway extends to administrative staff offices, a large training/conference\nroom, open work stations, a dining area and restrooms for staff. A secure file\nroom with lockable cabinets will house the client files and confidential CHRI\ninformation.\nV.
