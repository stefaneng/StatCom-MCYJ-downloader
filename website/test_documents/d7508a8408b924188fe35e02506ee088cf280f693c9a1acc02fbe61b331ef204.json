TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Date & method of SE initiation must be the date the SE was initiated by agency\nlicensing staff and not the date DHHS staff initiated their investigation.\n• If an individual is unable to be interviewed by the licensing worker, there must be\nan explanation within the report and not just within social work contact as those\ndo not populate into the report.\n• Licensing staff should only be using interviews conducted by other individuals\nsuch as DHHS staff or law enforcement if the licensing worker is unable to\ninterview the person themselves. If the licensing worker must use notes from\nanother investigator's interview, the reasons for doing so must be documented\nwithin the report.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Review of where to upload documentation would be beneficial as some\ndocumentation is being uploaded incorrectly.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD",
    "There were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. The one special evaluation reviewed resulting in a violation related to corporal\npunishment was reviewed. The foster parent was found in violation after admitting to\nusing corporal punishment with a youth. An appropriate corrective action plan was\nimplemented as a result. Concerns with the special evaluation report are documented\nwithin the technical assistance section of this licensing inspection report.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe one CAP submitted by the agency during the period under review was in\nresponse to the 2023 licensing interim inspection report completed on 4/26/2023.\nThe CAP was approved on 5/11/2023 and addressed nine violations, five of which\nwere repeated this year. Of those five, the individual incidents of non-compliance\nincreased in the area of PATP signatures, decreased in the areas of USP\nsignatures, and remained nearly the same related to service plan timeliness,\nFTMs, and case contacts. It is noted that the majority of violations established are\nlocated within one file that was case managed by a worker and supervisor who are\nno longer with the agency. Additional corrective action planning will be needed to\naddress the repeats as well as newly established violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nidentified barriers to compliance throughout the past year being high staff turnover,\nincluding staff members who left with little or no notice. This included members of\nthe supervision team. The turnover resulted in difficulty in maintaining consistency\nas there was a need to continually train new staff.\nFinancial Overview\nA review of the agency budget as well as an independent auditor's report on the\naudit of the agency's consolidated financial statements was reviewed. No\nconcerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed reported currently feeling supported by the supervision team\nwho they feel is knowledgeable. The staff who have been with the agency for\nlonger than a year report that the turnover with supervision and workers has been\ndifficult at time because job responsibilities have had to shift and caseloads must\nbe reassigned.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has sufficient space and equipment to perform job functions related to\nfoster care, licensing, and independent living services. Files are stored securely",
    "and physical CHRI is stored in a location that is only accessible to the licensing\nProgram Manager. A cross shredder is also located within the licensing Program\nManager's office.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nApril 25, 2024\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 26, 2024\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
