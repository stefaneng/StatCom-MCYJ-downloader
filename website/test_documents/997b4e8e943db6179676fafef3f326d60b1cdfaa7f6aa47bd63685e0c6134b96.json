She stated in early August 2025\nshe and Family Support Team Lead had picked up Youth A, Youth\nB and Youth C and were transporting them to a parenting time\nvisit with their Father.

She stated Youth A was part of a sibling group of 7 that\nwere removed from parents on July 3, 2025. Youth A was placed\nin her care, Youth B and Youth C were placed in a licensed foster\nplacement and the other four children were placed with their\nrespective non-respondent fathers. She stated she struggled from\nthe beginning with childcare and missed quite a bit of work\nopportunities. Relative Caregiver stated she repeatedly asked the\nagency for assistance, but they did nothing to help her. Relative\nCaregiver ended up securing childcare on her own. She also\n3",
    "reported being concerned about the visitation schedule due to the\nfrequency and the distance the children would be transported.\nRelative Caregiver stated one of the reasons Youth A was moved\nwas due to Relative Caregiver not supporting reunification. She\nstated Father has done a lot of awful things to the children and\nothers. She doesn’t feel the kids are safe around him but\nrecognizes she doesn’t have the authority to prevent anything.\nRelative Caregiver stated a Team Decision Meeting (TDM) took\nplace sometime toward the end of July 2025. She stated she\nwasn’t aware of the purpose of the meeting as it wasn’t\ncommunicated to her. During the TDM she stated all the\nparticipants asked her to give up placement of Youth A. She\nreported Youth A was doing well at that point. She was in daycare\nand had an established bedtime routine. Relative Caregiver stated\ntwo days later the same group called her and said they were\nmoving Youth A to a different placement. She verbalized she\ndidn’t agree to the placement change.\nMDHHS Purchase of Services Foster Care worker (MDHHS\nPOS FCW) was interviewed via telephone on August 25, 2025.\nShe stated the case involves the removal of seven children. Four\nof them were released to the care of their biological fathers, Youth\nA was placed with Relative Caregiver and Youth B and Youth C\nwere placed in a licensed foster home.\nMDHHS POS FCW clarified Youth A was placed with Relative\nCaregiver at the time of removal. Relative Caregiver indicated she\nwas only able to provide placement with Youth A and not any of\nthe other children and had even questioned if she could care for\nYouth A due to her work schedule and the need for childcare.\nRelative Caregiver made several phone calls to multiple\nindividuals connected to the case such as Guardian ad Litem\n(GAL), victim’s advocate associated with criminal case and staff at\nChild & Family Services stating foster care is terrible, she’s\noverwhelmed and no one is assisting her. When solutions were\noffered she wasn’t willing to take it. For example, Relative\nCaregiver made statements indicating no one is paying for\nchildcare. She was told the state will cover childcare expenses but\nshe needs to apply. She responded no one is helping her and they\nneed to apply for her. It was explained to her they are not able to\napply for her but they will bring a computer to her house to assist\nher and she declined the offer.\n4",
    "Relative Caregiver also expressed not agreeing with parenting\ntime occurring. She verbalized that Father’s rights should be\nterminated and questioned why visits were occurring.\nTransportation for parenting time was provided by the agency.\nRelative Caregiver complained about the number of people\npicking up Youth A. MDHHS POS FCW stated she became a\nbarrier to reunification and there was concern it would continue to\nget worse.\nRelative Caregiver also was concerned about the expenses of\nproviding placement for Youth A. She was told she would get a\nDetermination of Care (DOC) and was provided approximately\n$300 in gift cards.\nA TDM was held to discuss the placement and concerns regarding\nRelative Caregiver being overwhelmed. There was discussion\nregarding the struggles she was having. At that point there was\nnot a decision made regarding placement but they wanted to get\nRelative Caregiver’s thoughts. Relative Caregiver’s phone died\nbefore the meeting concluded. The meeting continued for another\n30 minutes and the placement decision was discussed without\nRelative Caregiver. Another meeting was held the following day\nwith the Prosecuting Attorney to discuss the concerns. It was\ndecided to move forward with a placement change. MDHHS POS\nFCW believes there were 3 meetings with GAL and Prosecuting\nAttorney representing MDHHS to ensure the right decision was\nmade. MDHHS POS FCW stated reunifying 3 of the siblings by\nmoving Youth A into the licensed placement with Youth B and\nYouth C who were already placed there also factored into the\ndecision. MDHHS POS FCW stated since Youth A was moved\nthere have been no concerns noted that she’s aware of.\nGuardian ad Litem (GAL) was interviewed via telephone on\nAugust 25, 2025. Youth A was removed from the parental home\non July 3, 2025. From the beginning, Relative Caregiver made\nseveral statements that were not conducive to reunification. She\nseemed to struggle understanding that even though some of the\nthings may have been occurring for a long time the court case just\nstarted and there are expectations and requirements. Part of the\nrequirement is to provide parenting time. That was an issue from\nday one because Relative Caregiver didn’t think Mother and\nFather should be able to see the children at all. Complaints were\nalso made about the transportation to parenting time. A meeting\nwas scheduled to discuss placement preservation. During the\nmeeting every idea that was brought up to assist, Relative\nCaregiver refused and said no she can’t do it. GAL stated Relative\n5",
    "Caregiver was almost begging for help but then would not take the\nhelp when offered.\nGAL stated a TDM was held to discuss the placement. During the\nTDM everyone was trying to get a sense of what the issues were\nand how they can assist. Relative Caregiver expressed concerns\nregarding childcare and finances. MDHHS was able to assist with\nchildcare but caregiver needed to apply. It was offered to assist\nher with the childcare application process but Relative Caregiver\nrefused. Anytime things came up and solutions were offered\nRelative Caregiver would refuse or come up with a reason why it\nwouldn’t work. She also complained about the number of\nappointments and the number of individuals transporting Youth A\nfor parenting time. Due to the ongoing concerns with Relative\nCaregiver and the ability to place Youth A in the same licensed\nfoster home with Youth B and Youth C, the decision was made to\nchange placement.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FC supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on August 26, 2025. Youth A was part of a sibling\ngroup of 7 who were removed from parents on July 3, 2025. Youth\nA was placed with Relative Caregiver and other placement\narrangements were found for the other children. FC supervisor\nclarified the youngest 3 children are full siblings. Youth B and\nYouth C were placed in a licensed foster home and the other\nchildren were placed with their respective nonrespondent fathers.\nRelative Caregiver expressed concern regarding finding childcare\nand worried about being terminated from her job. FC supervisor\nstated the agency offered to assist in applying and locating\nchildcare and Relative Caregiver would decline the assistance.\nShe ended up locating childcare that was almost an hour away\nfrom her house and created another barrier due to distance and\ntime. There was also concern that Relative Caregiver was not on\nboard with reunification with Mother and Father. FC supervisor\nstated Relative Caregiver made that known from the very\nbeginning. Her frustration was due to the number of CPS\ncomplaints made before the children were eventually removed.\nFC supervisor stated Relative Caregiver had notified the agency\ntoward the end of July 2025 she could not continue to provide\nplacement for Youth A due the distance between her home and\nthe day care and she felt she may end up losing her employment.\nShe had also stated Youth A wasn’t sleeping and it was disruptive\nto her being able to sleep and maintain a healthy schedule. At that\npoint a TDM was scheduled for July 22, 2025. By the end of the\n6",
    "meeting, it was determined Youth A would be moved to the\nlicensed foster home where Youth B and Youth C were placed.\nThe individuals present for the TDM included Relative Caregiver\nand a support person, GAL, MDHHS PAFC POS Monitor, FCW,\nand FC supervisor. Everyone present, other than Relative\nCaregiver felt it was in Youth A’s best interest long-term to be\nmoved to the placement of her full siblings.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nAugust 26, 2025. She stated Youth A was part of a sibling group\nof 7 who were placed in foster care on July 3, 2025. Youth A was\nplaced with Relative Caregiver. FCW stated Relative Caregiver\ncontacted her on July 9, 2025 and other times afterward\nrequesting Youth A be moved. She stated she couldn’t maintain\nplacement any longer and expressed concern she would lose her\njob and wasn’t able to find childcare. Relative Caregiver reported\nbeing stressed and Youth A would cry all night. FCW stated she\nassisted Relative Caregiver in applying for childcare. Relative\nCaregiver located a childcare on her own but it was an hour away\nfrom her home.\nThe first parenting time the children had Relative Caregiver made\na statement indicating she wasn’t in support of reunification and\ndidn’t think parents should be having any visitation. FCW stated\nshe had to explain the foster care process and the goal is\nreunification and parenting time would be regularly scheduled.\nRelative Caregiver expressed concerns regarding the visitation\nschedule and would make it more difficult when it came to\nscheduling the visits. FCW stated she would say it didn’t work with\nthe childcare provider or she would be vocal about the number of\npeople transporting Youth A to visits.\nFCW stated a TDM was scheduled to discuss the concerns, and\nthe decision was made to move Youth A to the licensed foster\nplacement with Youth B and Youth C who are full siblings to her.\nRelative Caregiver participated in the TDM and the concerns,\ndecision and reason for it was explained to her.\nFoster Parent (FP) was interviewed via telephone on\nSeptember 16, 2025. She stated she had placement of Youth B\nand Youth C since removal occurred on July 3, 2025.

FP stated she\nwas told by the agency Relative Caregiver couldn’t handle\nplacement of Youth A any longer and they were looking to place\nYouth A with her full siblings as well. FP clarified she has a\n7",
    "personal relationship with Relative Caregiver, and she had never\nmade those comments to her. FP stated Relative Caregiver\nreported she wanted more support trying to locate childcare.\nMother was interviewed via telephone on September 16, 2025.\nMother stated Youth A was moved from Relative Caregiver while\nshe was in inpatient treatment. She stated she was not provided\nany explanation as far as why Youth A was moved from Relative\nCaregiver at the time the placement change occurred but has\nsince been told the reason is so Youth A, Youth B and Youth C\ncan be in the same home. She stated FCW informed her she\nwould be notified if there were any changes with her case or\nanything impacting her children and their placement. She was not\ntold about the placement change at the time it occurred.
