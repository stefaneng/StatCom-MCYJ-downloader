EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were 1 substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. The special evaluation report documented the foster parent was abusing\nalcohol while caring for the youths in her home. The report was completed\nthoroughly, and the revocation recommendation was appropriate based on the\nfindings.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The one\nCAP submitted during the period under review was submitted in response to the\n2024 licensing renewal inspection. During that inspection, fifteen violations were\nestablished, four of which were MDHHS policy violations no longer regulated by\nDCWL. The remaining eleven violations were DCWL rule violations related to\nreplacement notifications, information provided to new caregiver, overdue\nmedicals and immunizations, visits with youth, and IL youth documentation. The\nChief Administrator developed and implemented a robust CAP that helped rectify\nsome of the areas of violation as evidenced by only one violation being repeated\nduring this year's inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was reviewed and discussed during the\nentrance meeting. He indicated the agency has experiences a great deal of\nstaffing issued over the past several months including the inability to hire needed\n6",
    "staff resulting in the need to cross train existing staff and replace them within the\ndepartment as needed, as well as multiple staff members going on leave with little\nto no notice. The chief administrator also identified staffing performance concerns\nthat have had to go through a lengthy disciplinary process during which work\nquality continues to be lacking. All of these factors have resulted in difficulty\nmaintaining compliance in all areas despite an effective CAP having been\nimplemented the previous year.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed reported there have been challenges related to\nstaffing changes and staff going on leave resulting in workers having to take on\nothers' cases and quickly assess what needed to be done. They all reported\nreceiving good support from leadership throughout the hectic changes and being\nable to rely on co-workers and supervisors for help with tasks, as needed.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe office appeared to have adequate space and equipment to provide for the\ndelivery of foster home certification, foster care, and independent living services.\nFiles are stored in a secured file room with locked cabinets containing closed\nadoption files. The office has no physical CHRI to store.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJune 10, 2025\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 10, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7",
