    "Analysis Regarding the allegation of Staff 1 speaking to Youth A in an\ninappropriate manner, there is not enough evidence to support\nthis allegation as based on interviews of staff and youth.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding the written\ndocumentation (Incident Reports) of youth going AWOL. Both\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 reported Youth A and Youth H going AWOL\nwhich is outlined in the allegations, but an incident report with\nStaff 1, Staff 2, Youth A and Youth H involved was never\ndiscovered. This leads to the possibility of two different\nconclusions. First the possibility that an incident report may not\nhave been written. Second since the reported incident took place\nfour months prior to this investigation, those interviewed may not\nbe reporting the actual details that occurred in the allegations\n(Staff 2 reported in his second interview that he reported on the\nwrong incident during the first interview). The reason for this\nTechnical Assistance is a focus on the facility developing a system\nto ensure accurate documentation occurred in a timely manner.\nThe second part of this Technical Assistance is the development\nof a daily over-site review to ensure all required documentation\nwas completed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency's program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It was reported Staff 1 will sleep while at work often and that he\nwill sit in his chair and fall asleep.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via phone on 3/14/2025.
