Foster Parent B reported Child A was placed in her\nhome from 10/13/2022 until 1/6/2023. The agency told her this\nwas Child A’s first time coming into care, and he had no behavior\n2",
    "concerns. Foster Parent B reported when she and her husband\nbegan to notice behavior issues with Child A, they began reporting\nthe behavior concerns to the agency. The agency worker and\nsupervisor were not responsive to their concerns. She said she\nbegan reaching out to Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) 3 because\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 4 was not following up with her. She\nsaid the agency did not return emails in a timely manner, and\nwhen Child A became a threat to her family and himself, the\nagency did not respond timely to remove him. She reported the\nagency staff’s actions/lack of action was disrespectful to her.\nFoster Parent B said Child A had episodes of crying since first\nbeing placed in her home. She said it was in December 2022\nwhen Child A’s behavior escalated and got more aggressive. She\nreported the behaviors that Child A displayed were that he was\ncombative (no details reported), he had multiple screaming spells,\nand he pushed her. She reported the first time Child A “became\nphysically aggressive and put hands on me” was in December\n2022. Foster Parent B did not elaborate on what she meant by\nputting hands on her, but she had stated prior that Child A pushed\nher. Foster Parent B did not describe the type of push or the\ncircumstances around it.\nFoster Parent B said she wanted to get Child A in therapy but\nknew that takes time. She said, Child A had an intake mental\nhealth service appointment on 12/7/2022 which the agency was\naware of. She said a mental health appointment was set, but it\nwas cancelled after she requested Child A’s replacement later in\nDecember of 2022. She said when she would ask FCW 4 for\nresources to assist Child A and her family, FCW 4 did not provide\nsuggestions of things they could do related to Child A’s behaviors.\nShe said FCW 4’s standard statement was that “this is what you\nsigned up for”. She said she told FCW 4 that she was not asking\nhim to take Child A for the appointment, just for him to provide\nresources. She said FCW 4 told her she could contact him for\nassistance, gave her his telephone number, but he was not sure\nof what to do. He told her he would speak with his supervisor and\nwould get back with her. Foster Parent B could not recall whether\nFCW 4 called her back. Foster Parent B said FCW 4 did finally\nprovide some resources, but then Child A’s became physically\naggressive, and she and her husband requested Child A’s\nemergency removal. She said the agency responded to their\nrequest by saying the agency has 30-days to replace Child A.\nShe said she sent the agency emails about Child A’s behaviors\nand her’s and her husband’s request for Child A’s removal. She\nsaid there was minimal communication from the agency about\n3",
    "their request. She provided me a copy of three emails she sent\nthe agency inclusive of a 12/17/2022 email from her to FCS 3\ndescribing Child A’s behaviors. The email indicated:\n➢ Child A is becoming more and more aggressive, displaying\noppositional defiant behavior; having increased screaming\nand crying spells. The screaming spells having become\nmore frequent, occurring several times a day.\n➢ Child A blocked one of them from walking down the\nstairway and pushed one of them recently.\n➢ Child A resists them holding his hand when walking in the\nstreets and in other public areas and pulls away.\n➢ Child A does not follow instructions or timeouts at the home\nthey do not have any other resources at their disposal to\nhelp de-escalate Child A’s aggressive outbursts and\nbehavior.\n➢ They have tried multiple ways to manage his behavior\nincluding, music therapy, Yoga, breath therapy, toys,\npictures of his loved ones in his room, reading stories about\nemotions, exercise, play therapy, teaching him proper\nreactions and emotion control with a puppy, singing,\nattempted water therapy for relaxation, contacting the crisis\ncenter, but Child A’s aggressive and oppositional defiant\nbehavior is increasing instead of decreasing.\n➢ They contacted the crisis center on one occasion due to\nChild A’s aggressive behavior and have begun the process\nto secure mental health services for Child A.\nFoster Parent B admitted a Family Team Meeting (FTM) was\nscheduled to discuss her foster home’s request for Child A’s\nreplacement and examine efforts that might be pursued to\nmaintain the placement. She reported the agency initially\nscheduled the FTM for 1/5/2023 and that was changed to\n1/6/2023. She said the agency never acknowledged their request\nfor the removal, nor offered an assessment of the situation. The\nagency only sent the email about the meeting. Foster Parent A\nsaid she did not attend the meeting due to a time frame conflict,\nbut she asked the agency about the results of that meeting. She\nwas advised the agency had planned to replace Child A on\n1/9/2023. Foster Parent B reported she terminated the placement\non 1/6/2023 by dropping Child A off at the agency’s 13-mile office\n(not the agency’s foster care agency) due to “safety concerns.”\nShe reported not knowing the correct office to take Child A to. She\nacknowledged being advised she could not just drop the child off,\nand that a children services complaint could be called against her\nfoster home.\n4",
    "Agency Interviews\nOn 1/30/2023 I interviewed, Licensee Designee 1 Administrator 2,\nFCS 3 and FCW 4 onsite site. I also spoke with Licensee\nDesignee 1 by telephone on 1/10/2023.\nAdministrator 2\nAdministrator 2 reported the allegations are not true, saying the\nagency was responsive to Foster Parent B emails and phone\ncalls. She reported per information from the agency staff and\nreview of the case record, the first time FCW 3 reported a concern\nbeing made by Foster Parent B was on 12/12/2022. The concern\nwas that Child A throws temper tantrums when Child A does not\nget his way. Administrator 2 reported the foster parents were\nuncooperative, had high and unrealistic expectations related to a\nfour-year-old and ended up dumping Child A off at their sister\nagency.\nLicensee Designee 1\nLicensee Designee (LD) 1 reported it was true that Foster Parent\nB had reported concerns, but not true that the agency was not\nresponsive to the family. She agreed with Administrator 2 as to\nthe first time Foster Parent B reported behavioral concerns for\nChild A. LD 1 recalled the concern being something to the effect\nof Foster Parent B reporting Foster Parent B and her husband\nwere afraid to walk down their stairs because Child A would block\nthe stairway and that scared them. The next time Foster Parent B\ncontacted the agency was via email on Sunday, 12/18/2022 (the\nnarrative was dated 12/17/2022, but it was received 12/18/2022),\nand that email was responded to on 12/19/2022. LD 1 reported if\nthere was any type of delay in getting back to Foster Parent B, it\nmay have been due to it being a holiday, and therefore the\nresponse to Foster Parent B may have occurred the next business\nday. LD 1 said with respect to Foster Parent B’s emails wanting\nChild A removed, she was also emailed and she responded to\nFoster Parent B. The agency advised Foster Parent B the agency\nwas trying to secure another placement for Child A. Also, that the\nDepartment was also looking for a placement him, but all this was\nnot fast enough for Foster Parent B.\nFoster Care Supervisor 3\nFCS 3 reported being the supervisor for Child A’s case since his\nplacement with the agency. She reported becoming aware of a\nbehavior reports for Child A within the first week of his placement.\nThe behavior was related to normal separation and loss, not\naggression. Foster Parent B and her husband said Child A was\ncrying a lot/having crying spells. Child A was saying he wanted to\n5",
    "go back with his mother and siblings. FCW 4 gave the foster\nparents resources on therapy and around trauma. FCS 3 reported\nknowing the latter was done, because the foster parents sent an\nemail saying they followed up with a therapy intake. FCS 3 said\nshe was not sure if the therapy had started before Child A left the\nfoster home.\nFCS 3 acknowledged there came a time she became aware of\nmore behavioral concerns for Child A. She said during a\nsupervision with FCW 4 sometime in November 2022, FCW 4 said\nFoster Parent B was reporting that Child A was getting out of\ncontrol and crying all the time. Foster Parent B was not giving\nFCW 4 specifics on what being out of control meant. FCS 3\nadvised FCW 4 to try to obtain more specifics related to the\nbehavior from Foster Parent B. For him to also share information\nwith the family about the foster parent support group, since this\nwas the foster family’s first placement. FCS 3 said FCW 4 had\nalready explored the possibility of a Difficult of Care rate (DOC)\nexploration, but Foster Parent B didn’t sign the document, and\nwas getting frustrated with FCW 4 and the process. Additionally,\nChild A was not showing qualification for any of the DOC\ncategories.\nFCS 3 denied awareness of Foster Parent B and or her husband\nhaving a fear of Child A’s behavior until a 12/18/2022 email from\nFoster Parent B. FCS 3 spoke with FCW 4 but was confused\nabout what Foster Parent B was reporting as concerns with\nextreme behaviors because the behaviors being reported were\nones a child dealing with trauma would present. And Foster\nParent B had made contact with the crisis line and was referred\nfor therapy. Also, at that point the foster parents were being\nuncooperative, Child A was missing his visit due to that, and the\nrelationship was deteriorating. The foster family was requesting\nChild A’s removal and FCS 3 was not sure what more the agency\nwas to do other than to seek another placement for Child A\nFCS 3 admitted to telling Foster Parent B the agency has 30-days\nto find another placement for Child A but she followed up with\nFoster Parent B on 12/19/2022 to let Foster Parent B know a\nplacement was being worked on. After that Foster Parent B kept\nemailing saying Child A was constantly crying, and that he tried to\npush her down the stairs. She told Foster Parent B several times\nno placement was available for Child A, but once one was found\nshe would contact Foster Parent B. She was in contact with the\nfoster parent almost daily thereafter. FCS 3 also sought respite for\nChild A on 1/3/2023, but their licensing department was unable to\n6",
    "find a respite provider. She said the agency sought to find a\nreplacement home, as soon as possible, but Foster Parent B did\nnot seem to think they were acting fast enough on anything.\nFCS 3 reported prior to the foster parent’s replacement request\nthe foster parents had only phoned her once and it was not related\nto Child A’s behavior. The foster parents had never phoned or\nemailed her to voice a concern about FCW 4 or to report FCW 4\nwas not doing what he was supposed to/what they needed or\nrequested. No one ever told Foster Parent B this is what she\nsigned up for. FCW 4 only tried to normalize the behaviors that\nChild A was displaying around his loss, but Foster Parent B just\ndidn’t seem to understand that trauma or to accept Child A’s\nbehaviors as normal for him in this situation.\nFoster Care Worker 4\nFCW 4 reported being assigned to Child A’s case since\n10/13/2022. He denied the foster parent contacting him all the\ntime about Child A’s behavior. He denied being disrespectful to\nthe foster parents in any way or not responding to their contacts.\nHe reported that the first time behavior concerns for Child A were\nbrought to his attention was during a foster home visit on\n12/12/2022. Foster Parent B reported that Child A was very\nemotional, and would cry a lot, especially after Child A’s parenting\ntime. FCW 4 reminded Foster Parent B Child A was coming into\ncare with lots of trauma and him crying a lot was to be expected.\nFoster Parent B said Child A would cry for hours, he had extreme\nbehaviors, and he was “out of control”, but Foster Parent B would\nnot specify what were the out-of-control behaviors. She only said\nChild A would stand in front of the stairs blocking their passage.\nHe asked Foster Parent B whether Child A was hitting, kicking or\nbiting and Foster Parent B would only state Child A was “out of\ncontrol” and that Child A had been that way since Child A first\ncame into her home. FCW 4 reported on that date, this was the\nfirst time the foster family was saying this. He said he had\npreviously provided Foster Parent B with therapy resources that\naccepted Child A’s insurance. He advised that this is what he\ndoes with all his cases, because of the issues of traumatization.\nHe encouraged the foster family to follow through on the resource.\nHe knew Foster Parent B utilized the resource because a\ntherapeutic intake occurred, and services were pending. He\nreminded the foster parent of the resource.\nFCW 4 report not being contacted by the foster parents again\nabout behavior concerns for Child A until 12/18/2022 (a Sunday)\nvia an email to FCS 3, which he was copied on. At that time\n7",
    "Foster Parent B put in a 30-day replacement request. FCW 4\nspoke with FCS 3 about that email request on Monday\n12/19/2022. FCS 3 advised him she would follow up with the\nfoster parents, which FCS 3 did via email and copied him on that\nday. He said the next time the foster parents referenced Child A’s\nbehavior was on 1/6/2022. Foster Parent B texted him on that\ndate to indicate she had dropped Child A off at the Royal Oak\noffice and that Child A’s behavior was a continued safety concern.\nDocument Review\nCopies of emails from Foster Parent B showing she emailed the\nfoster care supervisor, worker and or another agency staff and the\nagency’s reply:\n➢ A 12/18/2023 email dated 12/17/2022 as described in\nFoster Parent B interviewed. She requested to have Child\nA replaced from her foster home.\n➢ A 12/19/2022 email response from FCS 3 to Foster Parent\nB. FCS 3 acknowledged the foster parent’s email and\nexpressed concern about what was being reported by\nFoster Parent B. FCS 3 indicated she would notify the\nlicensing department and they will begin the search to find\na new placement for Child A. That per policy licensing does\nhave 30 days to find a new placement, but they will begin\nthe search immediately.\n➢ A 12/31/2022 email from Foster Parent B that indicated\nChild A is “continuously being combative, pushing and\nhaving screaming spells. He blocked her from walking\ndown the steps again today. Emergency removal\nrequested. She asked FCS 3 to please let them know when\nthe emergency removal will occur. That if FCS 3 is unable\nto address this concern, please let them know who they\nneed to contact.\n➢ A 1/6/2023 email to FCS 3 and FCW 4 inquiring whether an\nemail and text was received related to a summary of the\nteam meeting which they were not able to attend. That they\nare awaiting a response to their request for Child A’s\nemergency removal, and that they have not received any\nphone calls from the worker since they put in the request.\nThis email reiterated they have safety concerns and also,\nthey are looking forward to information regarding when\nChild A will be picked up today or what they need to do.\nChild A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n➢ Child A entered care due to neglect. He was placed with\nthe agency on 10/13/2022, and with Foster Parent B and\nFoster Parent C on that date.\n8",
    "➢ His placement intake indicated he may have asthma. No\nother identified special needs were indicated.\n➢ Verification of FCW 4 providing the foster family various\ntherapeutic and daycare resources on 10/25/2022. The\ndocumentation to Foster Parent B denoted that the\nresources included a few facilities that can handle trauma\ntherapy and accepts Medicaid.\n➢ Agency contact with Foster Parent B by email on\n12/19/2022 acknowledging the removal request. They will\nbegin a replacement search immediately.\n➢ A follow up email from FCS 3 sent in response to another\nemail from Foster Parent B’s email on 12/19/2022, where\nFCS 3 indicated the agency did not have a foster home\nlined up yet and would have nowhere to place Child A\ntoday. That time is needed to locate another placement,\nand FCS 3 would reach back out to Foster Parent B once\nFCS 3 has more information to report.\n➢ A 1/3/2023 text to Foster Parent B from FCW 4 about a\npossible placement for Child A\n➢ A 1/3/2023 email to Foster Parent B by FCS 3 that a\nplacement was located but the family cannot take Child A\nuntil 1/9/2023. Additionally, following an email from Foster\nParent B that Child A’s behaviors are escalating, and she\ncannot wait to have him removed from the home, and she\nwill not transport him to his parenting time today. FCS 3\nadvised Foster Parent B she would try to locate a respite\nplacement for Child A sooner than 1/9/2023, and asked\nFoster Parent B whether an alternate caregiver person\ncould assist Foster Parent B with parenting time transport.\n➢ A 1/4/2023 text to Foster Parent B from FCW 4 inviting the\nfoster parent to an FTM on 1/5/2023 related to Child A\nreplacement. Foster Parent B replied back she will not\nattend the meeting. And later documentation of the FTM on\n1/5/2023.\n➢ Subsequent back and forth emails/contacts between FCS\nFCW 4, or Licensee Designee 1 with Foster Parent B\nbetween 12/21/2023 and 1/6/2023 related to Foster Parent\nB’s questions about the status of Child A’s removal plans\nand the agency attempts to replace him as soon as\npossible.\n➢ A 1/5/2023 7:53PM social work contact by centralize intake\nthat Foster Parent B contacted centralized intake about\ngetting Child A removed, alleging the agency had not been\nresponsive to their request for removal, indicating Child A\nhas kicking, and hitting behaviors (which in prior contacts\n9",
    "Foster Parent B had not reported) and that she was\nthinking of dropping Child A off.\n➢ A 1/6/2023 text from Foster Parent B to FCW 4 that she\ndropped Child A off at the Royal Oak Judson Center office.\nThen communication by LD 1 with Foster Parent B while\nFoster Parent B was at the Royal Oak location, and LD 1\nadvised Foster Parent B not to leave Child A at the Judson\nChild Safe office. Foster Parent B ultimately left Child A at\nJudson Child Safe.\n` Based on interviews and case information documented, there is\ninsufficient evidence to support the allegation that the agency was\nnot responding to the foster parent’s requests for assistance and\nthe child’s replacement. Nor sufficient evidence of a lack of direct\nwork with relevant individuals related to implementation of the\ncase service plan.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12411 Clothing policy.\nSection (1) An agency’s clothing policy shall, at a minimum, ensure that\nDescription each foster child has a sufficient amount of clothing that is\nappropriate as to size and season and that is in good repair.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not provide a clothing allowance to the foster\nparents for the foster child.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nFoster Parent B\nOn 1/10/2023 I interviewed Foster Parent B/the complainant by\ntelephone. Foster Parent B reported Child A was brought to her\nhome with inadequate clothing. He had inappropriate under\nclothing, a pair of plastic shoes, and a thin coat. She said she\nspoke with the worker about a clothing allowance for him on a\nnumber of occasions, but she was never given an update on the\nstatus of the clothing allowance. She sent an email to the agency\nas recent 1/5/2023. She provided me a copy of that email that\nlisted an outstanding $210.00 clothing allowance. Foster Parent B\ndid not say she had not purchased clothing for Child A, only that\nshe never received the clothing allowance.\nAgency Interviews\n10",
    "On 1/30/2023 I interviewed Licensee Designee 1, Administrator 2,\nFCS 3, and FCW 4 onsite site. I also spoke with Licensee\nDesignee 1 by telephone on 1/10/2023.\nLicensee Designee 1 and Administrator 2\nThese administrators reported Child A was not without clothing.\nThey said Child A’s clothing allowance was delayed and was\npending. Neither reported the reason for the delay.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)3\nFCS 3 did not recall speaking with Foster Parent B about a\nclothing allowance. She reported the process for the clothing\nallowance request is for the worker to complete a clothing\ninventory (DHS-3377) and submit it to her so that the clothing\nallowance can be submitted to the State. She said FCW 4\ncompleted the DHS-3377 form timely on his first foster home visit\nin October 2022, but FCW 4 did not submit the form to her, so that\nthe clothing allowance request could occur. FCW 4 apparently\nforgot. He did not submit the October DHS-3377 to her until about\none week ago.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)4\nFCW 4 affirmed FCS 3’s reporting. He said he completed the\nclothing inventory on 10/18/2022 and Foster Parent B signed it\nthat day. He acknowledged that Child A only came with a few\nitems, and some were not adequate. He explained to Foster\nParent B it was not abnormal for children to enter care that way.\nHe informed Foster Parent B he would submit the clothing\nallowance request but did not give her a timeline as to when the\nfunds would be available. She also advised Foster Parent B of\nthe agency’s foster care clothing closet, but Foster Parent B never\nfollowed up to utilize it. He also told Foster Parent B, he could\npick up Child A some items from the foster care clothing closet,\nbut he was never provided Child A’s sizes by Foster Parent B. He\nsaid he could not have just taken items to provide to the family,\nbecause they had not indicated the sizes on the DHS-3377, he\ncompleted on 10/18/2022.\nFCW 4 said he uploaded the DHS-3377 form into their shared\nfolder and thought FCS 3 would go in and see it. He admitted the\nprotocol is that they are to notify the supervisor that the DHS-3377\nis in the system and to provide the supervisor a copy of the\ndocument. He admitted to not submitting the October inventory to\nFCS 3 until a about a week ago. He could not recall the exact date\nof that submission but stated the clothing allowance for Child A\nwas pending. He reported this delay did not mean Child A did not\n11",
    "having clothing. He said Child A received clothing via the holiday\nwish list. FCW 4 said he did not complete a new clothing\ninventory/DHS-3377 for Child A’s new placement. Child A’s\nclothing allowance will be provided to his new placement.\nDocument Review\n• Clothing Inventory (DHS-3377) date 10/18/2022 which\nshowed he had one jacket, one pajamas, and one hat. His\nshoe size was written on form as a “size 13 or 1”. No other\nsizes were noted.\n• Judson Center’s Clothing policy outlining the process for\nensuring children receive clothing in a timely matter that is\nin good repair and sufficient and appropriate to size and\nseason.\nAnalysis There is insufficient evidence to support that Child A did not have\nclothing to meet his needs after being in placement with Foster\nParent B and Foster Parent C; only that the foster parents did not\nreceive the clothing allowance. Child A received clothing via the\nagency’s holiday drive, and clothing were also offered via the\nagency’s foster care clothing closet, if needed, and that was not\nutilized by the foster family.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12403 Policy and procedures\nSection (1) An agency shall have and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures for the foster care services provided.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency reported it would reimburse the foster parents for the\nchild’s day care registration fee of $100 and has not done so.\nInterviews:\nFoster Parent B\nOn 1/10/2023 I interviewed Foster Parent B/the complainant by\ntelephone. Foster Parent B reported having to paid a $100.00\nregistration fee to enroll Child A in Daycare in November 2022.\nShe provided the receipt to FCW 4, who said he would get the fee\nreimbursed. He never said how long that would take, but the\nagency has not reimbursed her.\nFoster Parent B provided me an email dated 1/5/2023 that she\nsent to FCW 4, FCS 3 and LD 1. The email indicated mileage\nsheet totals for October, November and December 2022 were\nenclosed and that other outstanding items for reimbursement\nincluded the registration at KinderCare for $100.\n12",
    "Agency Interviews\nOn 1/30/2023 I interviewed, Licensee Designee 1; FCS 3 and\nFCW 4 about this complaint onsite. I also spoke with Licensee\nDesignee 1 by telephone on 1/10/2023. All three staff denied\ntelling Foster Parent B the agency would reimburse the fee.\nLicensee Designee (LD) 1\nLD 1 said she spoke with Foster Parent B in late October or early\nNovember about swimming lessons for Child A, which the agency\nhelped get Child A into. Foster Parent B never mentioned a\nregistration fee back in. LD 1 acknowledged Foster Parent B had\nmentioned a Daycare registration fee via email on 1/6/2023 when\nFoster Parent B submitted mileage documentation for\nreimbursement. She told Foster Parent B she would follow up on\nthat. Then everything blew up with Foster Parent B dropping Child\nA off; and she forgot to response back, but she never told her the\nagency would pay the fee.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)3\nFCS 3 did not recall ever telling Foster Parent B the agency would\nreimburse her for a daycare fee.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 4\nFCW 4 reported Foster Parent B had initially told him about the\ntotal cost for the day care was over a $1000,00 and he advised\nher that the agency does not have those resources. He told her\nday care payments are covered via the State and gave her the link\nvia email on 10/25/2022. He said Foster Parent B never\nmentioned a $100.00 registration fee to him prior; he was not sure\nwhy Foster Parent B thought he said the agency would pay a\ndaycare fee.\nDocument Review\n• A 1/6/2023 email from Foster Parent B to FCW 3, FCS 4\nand LD 1 which contained information as described earlier\nin this section.\n• A 10/25/2022 email by FCW 4 referenced in his interview\nshowing information regarding day care assistance and\ntherapeutic resources.\n• Child A’s Initial Service Plan (ISP) showing a 10/21/2022\ncontact where Foster Parent B reported to FCW 4 she has\nfound a private school she wants Child A to attend and\nFCW 4 advised her children in foster care do not typically\nhave coverage for private school.\n13",

She said FCW 4 completed\nthe DHS-377 form timely on his first foster home visit in October\n2022, but FCW 4 did not submit the form to her so that the\nclothing request could occur. FCW 4 did not submit the DHS-3377\nto her until about one week ago.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 4\nFCW 4 affirmed FCS 3’s reporting.
