INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & R 400.12404 – Placement\nSection (4) An agency shall consider all of the following factors in selecting\nDescription an appropriate placement for a child.\n(b) The physical, emotional, and educational needs of the\nchild.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency failed to assess a home prior to foster care\nplacement.\n1",
    "Investigation Interviews:\nAttempts were made to interview Complainant on 03/11/2025\nand 03/19/2025 but were unsuccessful. I interviewed\nComplainant by phone on 03/24/2025. Complainant reported\nreceiving payment for the time the children were placed in\nComplainant’s care.\nI interviewed Placement Worker and Foster Care Supervisor by\ntelephone on 01/23/2025. Foster Care Supervisor and Placement\nWorker both reported Youth A and Youth B were initially placed in\nthe home on 12/17/2024 by Child Protective Services. Foster\nCare Supervisor stated the caregiver reported receiving an\neviction notice prior to the placement of Youth A and Youth B.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated a change in placement was in\nprocess and notice had been given to the caretaker 01/14/2025.\nPlacement Worker stated they completed a Relative Approval\nand Placement Safety Screen - MDHHS - 5770 on 12/17/2024.\nPlacement Worker stated the home only had one bedroom and\ndid not have enough beds for Youth A, Youth B, and all the other\noccupants of the home. Placement Worker stated the agency’s\nInitial Home Assessment (3130-A) with a completed dated\n01/22/2025 recommended denial. Placement Worker stated the\ncourt ordered placement approval anyway. Placement Worker\nstated a subsequent assessment was then completed with an\napproval recommendation so the caregiver could receive\nfunding/payment for the placement of Youth A and Youth B.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nThe placement records for Youth A and Youth B were reviewed.\nThis record indicated the youth were initially placed on 12/17/2024\nand were subsequently replaced in a licensed home effective\n01/31/2025.\nThe initial MDHHS-5770 completed dated 12/17/2024, noted initial\nemergency placement safety screen type. This indicated\nadequate number of sleeping spaces but noted to provide air\nmattresses and bedding. This also indicated caregiver had\nadequate household resources but noted working but may need\nassistance i.e. Food and Foster Care payments. The 5770 did not\nrecommend placement but noted the court ordered placement\nagainst recommendation.\nInitial 3130-A dated 01/22/2025 with a denial recommendation due\nto the concerns with space.\n2",
    "The subsequent addendum dated 01/23/2025 with an approval\nrecommendation to reflect the court order approval was reviewed.\nIt noted caregiver was struggling financially and is behind on rent.\nThe report noted the court ordered placement with caregiver\nagainst MDHHS recommendation. MDHHS did not recommend\nplacement because the home is too small for three children and\none adult with there being only one bedroom.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with the rule as the agency\nappropriately assessed the home and recommended denial of\nplacement based on lack of space and finances however the court\ncontinued to order a direct placement against the agency’s\nrecommendation.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n03/19/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 25, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3"
