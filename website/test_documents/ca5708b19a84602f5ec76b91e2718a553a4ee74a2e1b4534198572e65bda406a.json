    "Allegation Youth was restrained before the intervention was needed.\nInvestigation On 2/3/23, I spoke to Complainant 1 via telephone. Complainant 1\ndid not add any other details to the alleged complaint.\nI spoke to Administrator 1 via telephone on 2/3/23. Administrator 1\nreported that Youth A was restrained, and it was a \"clean\nrestraint\". Administrator 1 reported that Youth A was restrained\nafter he had verbally threatened peers and staff. Administrator 1\nreported that Youth A ran towards other youth in the group to\nphysically attack them and then was restrained.\nI reviewed the video on 2/6/23. The video was for the incident date\non 1/30/23. The video reveals Youth A sitting down on a chair and\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 are near him. They opened up Youth A's\nbedroom door and were pointing for Youth A to go into his room\nfor a behavior management timeout (seclusion). Youth A refused\nand stood up and walked from one end of the room to the other.\nThree youth sitting at a table then got up and were removing\nthemselves from the area when Youth A ran towards them. Youth\nA was then restrained.\nAll interviews were conducted face to face on 2/6/23 at the facility\nwith DHHS Worker 1 unless otherwise noted.\nYouth A reported he was not following the rules of the facility and\na \"Group Attention\" (GA) was conducted. Youth A reported he\nwould not accept responsibility so; he was placed on a \"group\nrestriction\" for not following the rules of the facility. Group\nrestriction meant that he was to be sent away from the group and\nquietly think about his actions. Youth A reported Youth B was\nstating comments to him that were not appropriate and when\nYouth A voiced his concerns then Staff 1 asked him to go into his\nroom for a BMT (Behavior Management Timeout). Youth A\nreported he refused and then \"postured\" towards Youth B and\nwent towards Youth B and stated, \"Let's get crackin\" insinuating\nhe wanted to fight Youth B. Youth A reported that Staff 1 grabbed\nhis arm and restrained him.\nYouth B and Youth C both reported that Youth A would not accept\nresponsibility for his behavior earlier and was on \"group\nrestrictions\". Both youth reported that Youth A came after them\nand stated \"let's get this crackin\" insinuating Youth A wanted to\nfight with Youth B. Both youth reported that Staff 1 grabbed Youth\nA to restraint Youth A. Both youth reported they left the area per\nprocedure when a youth was getting restrained.\n2",
    "Staff 1 reported Youth A was upset with the other youth in the unit.\nStaff 1 reported they called a GA and Youth A refused to be a part\nof it. Staff 1 reported that they then placed Youth A on a \"group\nrestriction\" meaning he was not a part of the youth activities until\nhe accepted and changed behavior. In the meantime he had to sit\nand not talk. Youth A was compliant with the group restriction but\nthen placed his sweater over his head. Staff 1 reported he\nredirected Youth A and then Youth A got upset and was cussing.\nStaff 1 reported he opened Youth A's bedroom door to give him a\nBMT and Youth A refused to enter. Youth A then started cussing\nand threatening the other youth in the unit, stating they were\nthreatening him. Youth A got up from his chair and stated, \"let's\nget this crackin\" and went after the other youth on the other side of\nthe unit. Staff 1 then restrained him.\nAnalysis Video observation and interviews with Youth A, B, and C and Staff\n1 all confirm that Youth A was verbally threatening the other youth\nin the unit and did attempt to go after Youth B. Staff intervened to\nprovide safety of the youth. All reported the behavior management\nprocess, group attention, group restriction, and BMT were all\noffered to Youth A before a restraint was utilized.\nTechnical Assistance: It was clear in the video and in interviews\nthat Youth A was sitting quietly in his chair away from the unit.\nOnly when confronted about placing his head in his shirt did he\nbegin to escalate. A training may be warranted to discuss when\nand where to \"pick battles\" concerning a youth's behavior. Another\narea of Technical Assistance is to remove the targeted audience\nquicker.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth, reduction,\nSection prevention, prohibited restraints, elimination of restraints\nDescription (2) The following restraints are strictly prohibited: (e) Restraining\nyouth in a prone position or any restraint that restricts the youth’s\nairway.\n(5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth’s\ntreatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\n3",
    "Allegation Youth was restrained and had a bruise (handprint) on his arm and\nbruising on his knees from the restraint. Youth was initially\ngrabbed by the throat.\nInvestigation On 2/3/23, I spoke to Complainant 1 via telephone. Complainant 1\ndid not add any other details to the alleged complaint.\nComplainant 1 did confirm she visually saw bruises on Youth A's\narm that looked like fingerprints and that Youth A had bruises on\nhis knees.\nI reviewed the video of the restraint on 2/6/23. The incident took\nplace on 1/30/23 from 6:20:43pm-6:57:10pm. The following\nobservations are noted from the video:\nThe video shows from 6:40:40-6:40:53pm Youth A was in a prone\nrestraint. Youth A attempted to get up and then went down on his\nside but then placed back into prone from 6:41:23-6:42:03 until\nlifted up from prone by Staff 1 and Staff 2. It is to be noted that\nStaff did not release their holds from Youth A when he was prone.\nFrom 6:42:10-6:51:30, Youth A was restrained up against the wall\nof the unit. Youth A was facing the wall while restrained up against\nit.\nAll interviews were conducted face to face on 2/6/23 at the facility\nwith DHHS Worker 1 unless otherwise noted.\nThe facility uses the MACH restraint module. Supervisor 1, trainer\nof MACH, reported that prone restraints and restraining an\nindividual up against the wall are not trained in the MACH module.\nSupervisor 1 reported they are not providing any tools or direction\nat this time to staff when a youth goes into prone position on\naccident.\nStaff 1 reported he did not think that Youth A was prone, but only\non his side. Staff 1 reported that he had Youth A's arm but was\nalso attempting to get his radio from Youth A. Youth A had gotten\na hold of his radio as they fell to the ground during the restraint.\nStaff 1 reported they do not take kids to the ground for restraints\nand that the main reason to restrain is to get the youth into their\nroom for seclusion. Staff 1 reported when they got Youth A up, he\ncontinued to fight so they placed him up against the wall and\nrestrained him there until they were able to get him into the\nbedroom. Staff 1 reported in MACH training, they are allowed to\nrestrain a youth against the wall. Staff 1 reported that Nurse 1 did\nenter into the unit and stated they were placing too much pressure\non his back, so they released pressure.\n4",
    "Staff 2 reported that Staff 1 and Youth A fell to the ground during\nthe restraint. Staff 2 reported they were struggling on the ground,\nand it took some time to get up from the ground. Staff 2 reported\nhe did not think that Youth A was prone, but only on his side. Staff\n2 reported when they got him to his feet, they then restrained him\nup against the wall. Staff 2 reported that Nurse 1 entered in the\nunit and made a comment to make sure that Youth A could\nbreathe well.\nSupervisor 2 reported that when she entered into the unit, they\nwere on the ground with Youth A trying to get him up from the\nfloor. Supervisor 2 reported that they got him up and restrained\nhim against the wall. Since Youth A would not deescalate, they\nhandcuffed him and took him into his room for seclusion.\nSupervisor 2 reported she did not hear if Nurse 1 stated anything\nduring the restraint.\nStaff 3 reported that when he entered the unit, he helped place\nYouth A in a restraint up against the wall. Staff 3 reported they\nplaced handcuffs on Youth A and then walked him to his room for\nseclusion. Staff 3 did not hear anything from Nurse 1.\nYouth A reported he was restrained after he attempted to\n\"posture\" against Youth B. Youth A reported he went towards\nYouth B and stated, let's \"get to crackin\". Youth A reported Staff 1\ngrabbed him by his arm and pulled him back and then they fell to\nthe ground. Youth A reported that Staff 1 and Staff 2 were holding\nhim to the ground and one of the staff was holding his neck down.\nYouth A reported he was laying on his chest. Youth A reported he\nattempted to get up from the floor and Staff 1 and Staff 2 pushed\nhim back down. Youth A reported he was then let up and\n\"slammed\" against the door. Youth A reported when Nurse 1\ncame in she told the staff to stop pressing on his back. Youth A\nreported they then put handcuffs on him and he went into his room\nfor the rest of the night in a \"BMT\" (Behavior Management\nTimeout). Youth A reported he had bruises on his arm and knees\nbecause of the restraint.\nI observed Youth A on 2/6/23 and I could not verify bruises.\nI reviewed training files for Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, and\nStaff 5. All staff had updated training in MACH.\nStaff 2 did have discipline in his file for the following items:\n5",
    "2018: Failure to read and follow Behavior Management Plan and\nResident Medical Assessment and failure to exercise appropriate\nsupervision when youth escalated.\n2021: Suspension for not using the approved restraint system\n2022: Last Chance Agreement: repeatedly entering unit office and\nusing personal phone. Failure to complete security round and\nfalsifying documentation.\nI reviewed the MACH restraint techniques via internet training.\nI reviewed the Use of Force Policy which identifies MACH as the\nrestraint module in use.\nAnalysis Video observation and interview with Youth A confirm that Youth A\nwas in a prone position while being restrained. Although Staff 1\nand Youth A fell to the ground, Staff 1 and Staff 2 did not release\ntheir hold on Youth A. Both continued to hold him while they\nstruggled with Youth A. Youth A was also restrained up against a\nwall, face first, for over nine minutes. The MACH training does not\nteach this, verified by Supervisor 1, trainer for MACH. The\nrestraint was not completed in a manner that was safe or\nappropriate, due to it being outside of the restraint module,\nincluding prone position and restrained face first up against the\nwall.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTo ensure the safety of youth involved in a restraint, any time a\nrestraint is initiated, and youth and staff fall to the floor, the\nrestraint should immediately be stopped. MACH restraints do not\nallow for a floor restraint; therefore, there should not be a time that\nstaff are holding a youth when they are on the floor. While\nreviewing the agency “Use of Force Policy” it noted, “If the\nresident ends up in the prone position during a physical restraint,\nhandcuffs will be applied, and the resident brought to a sitting or\nstanding position.” This will need to be removed from their policy\nas this is not an appropriate usage of mechanical restraints\noutlined in the law or rules.\nConclusion REPEAT Violation Established\nSIR 2022C0137007 INTAKE 12/9/21; CAP APPROVED 2/23/22\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4162 Seclusion within secure and nonsecure\nSection facilities; seclusion plan; prohibitions; reduction and\nDescription elimination\n(11) All seclusion will be prohibited effective November 1, 2022.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\n6",
    "Allegation The agency is using seclusion and is not permitted to do so in\naccordance with the rules.\nInvestigation All interviews were conducted face to face with DHHS Worker 1 at\nthe facility on 2/6/23.\nAdministrator 1 reported Youth A was placed in seclusion.\nI reviewed the Incident Report dated 1/30/23. The incident report\nnoted that Youth A was placed in \"confinement\" for behavior\nmanagement. Supervisor 2 was notified of the confinement.\nAccording to video, Youth A was placed in his room at 6:53:55pm.\nVideo observation of the incident shows Youth A being initially\nasked to go into his room before he was restrained, and Youth A\nrefused. After the restraint, Youth A was handcuffed and walked to\nhis room for seclusion.\nSupervisor 1 reported youth always go into their room for\nseclusion after they are restrained.\nYouth A reported that youth receive BMT's for behaviors such as\n\"cussing\" at staff or being defiant. Youth A reported there are two\ntype of BMT's. The first type is the youth will go into their room\nand sit on the mattress. The time is anywhere between 1-1.5\nhours. The door will not be locked but they are not allowed to get\nup or leave the room. The second type is called a \"reentry.\" A\nreentry occurs after a restraint. Their mattress is removed from\ntheir room, and they have to sit on the concrete slab. The door is\nshut and locked. Youth A was restrained on 1/30/23 and reported\nthat he was placed in a BMT after the restraint and did not come\nout the rest of the night.\nYouth C reported there is a process for entering into a BMT. First\na peer in the group redirects the youth not following the rules, then\na different peer redirects him if he doesn't listen. If this doesn't\nwork, then they get into a circle as a group and process the\nbehavior. If the youth still does not accept responsibility, then the\nyouth receive a group restriction which means they are not\ninvolved in whatever activity the group is doing and they are\nunable to talk. Youth C reported they are not allowed out of their\nroom and have to sit down on their bed. Youth C reported they are\nnot allowed to read or lay down or this will extend their time. Youth\nC reported they could be in the room for 15 minutes up to one\nhour depending on how the youth acts in the room. Youth C\nreported that Youth A went into a BMT after his restraint.\n7",
    "Youth B reported the youth at the facility do receive BMT's if they\nare not following the program. Youth B reported they can go\nwillingly to their room over minor issues, but if they are threatening\nor aggressive, they will be restrained and placed in the room for a\nBMT. Both BMT's the youth are not allowed to leave the room.\nYouth C reported you must have four 15-minute checks of\ncompliance before you can come out of the room.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was placed in BMT after his restraint.\nStaff 1 reported youth do enter into BMT as a consequence for\nacting out, cussing, throwing things, and threatening behavior.\nStaff 1 reported that the door only gets locked if they are\nthreatening or restrained. Staff 1 reported there is two 15-minute\nchecks before the youth can come out of the BMT. Staff 1\nreported that after restraints youth are to go into seclusion and\nStaff 1 reported he has never been told not to seclude youth. Staff\n1 reported BMT's usually occur daily.\nStaff 2 reported they do place youth in seclusion. Staff 2 reported\nthis is a relatively normal consequence. Staff 2 reported they can\ncome out of their room if they have had two 15-minute checks of\ncompliance.\nSupervisor 2 reported that BMT's are rarely used. Supervisor 2\nreported that once youth have deescalated, they are to come out\nof their room.\nStaff 3 reported Youth A was placed in seclusion after the restraint\nand stayed in his room until the next day.\nBoth Staff 4 and Staff 5 reported BMT's are used but not often.\nAll staff and Supervisor 1 and Supervisor 2 reported they were not\naware they could not use seclusion.\nAnalysis New Child Caring Licensing Rules went into effect on May 31,\n2022. A Child Caring Institution Letter was sent out to all CCI's.\nThe new rules explicitly state that on November 1, 2022, all\nseclusion will be prohibited. The agency, after receiving the new\nrules, had to provide policy updates to their consultant. The\nagency was informed of the new rules and did not abide by them.\nStaff and supervisors report they are unaware of the new rule and\nwas never provided direction to stop using seclusion.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\n8",
    "The agency does have written procedures, for completing a health\nstatus screening, but they are not sufficient. The agency's current\npolicy states that the supervisor is to notify the medical\ndepartment and the medical department will evaluate the youth.\nThe procedure for what an evaluation consists of is not outlined.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n2/23/23\n______________________________________\nVenus M Decker Date\nChild Welfare Licensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 3, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n9"
