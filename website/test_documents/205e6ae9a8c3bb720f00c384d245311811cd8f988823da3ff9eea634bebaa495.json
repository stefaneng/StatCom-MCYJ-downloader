    "record contains documentation that visitation is detrimental to\nthe resident.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation After arriving to the facility Youth A's parent was denied visitation\nwith Youth A because of unspecified disciplinary reasons.\nInvestigation Youth A’s Mother was interviewed over the phone on\n01/29/2025. She reported that her son had been placed at the\nfacility through his juvenile delinquency case on 01/24/2025. The\nmother spoke with the facility that day and was advised that a\nvisitation could occur on that coming Sunday. She then drove\nfrom their home to the facility on 01/26/2025, approximately a\nthree-hour drive. When Youth A’s Mother arrived, she spoke with\na male staff and a female supervisor and was informed that she\nwould not be able to have a visitation with Youth A. It was\nexplained to her that Youth A had an “infraction” and as a result\nwould not be able to have visitation. Youth A’s Mother recalled\nbeing upset at this news and asked what could be done to figure\nout a way for her to have even a few minutes of a visit. She\nrecalled the staff telling her that there was nothing that could be\ndone that day for Youth A to see her. Youth A’s Mother drove\nhome and made efforts to communicate with facility\nadministration. As of the date of this interview Youth A’s Mother\nreported not having contact with the administration of the\nfacility. She reported she was enroute to the facility as the\ninterview occurred to have a visitation with Youth A.\nChief Administrator was interviewed on 01/30/2025 during an\nunannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He reported a\nconsistent recollection of what occurred on 01/26/2025 that led to\nYouth A not having a visitation with Youth A’s Mother. Chief\nAdministrator confirmed Youth A was able to visit with his mother\non 01/29/2025 and plans were being made for additional visits to\noccur before his upcoming discharge to an out-of-state residential\ntreatment program.\nYouth A was interviewed on 01/30/2025 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He confirmed the date that he had\nan intended visitation with Youth A’s Mother and what\noccurred. Youth A recalled shift change occurring in the mid\nafternoon and he was in his room. He had his toothbrush in his\nhand and out of boredom Youth A began to rub the end on the\nwall, grinding the toothbrush to a pointy edge. Youth A believed\n2",
    "after the fact that this object could easily be misunderstood as a\nweapon or on object that could be used for self-harm. Youth A\ndenied he had either of those intentions and stated that he was\nonly doing this because he was bored. A female staff walked by\nand noticed what he was doing. He recalled a supervisor coming\nto explain to him that he had to serve a room restriction because\nhe had made a weapon. Youth A could not recall any of the staff\nmember’s names that interacted with him. Youth A understood\nthe consequences and stated that he did not argue, despite\nrecognizing that the room restriction would cause him to miss his\nvisitation with his mother. Youth A confirmed he had been able to\nhave a visitation with Youth A’s Mother’s the day prior to the\ninterview on 01/29/25.\nYouth A’s Probation Officer was interviewed over the phone on\n03/07/2025. He reported having no concerns over Youth A’s\nplacement at the facility and their implementation of parenting\ntime. He had been made aware by the facility of the concerns and\nresulting program discipline for Youth A on the date of Youth A’s\nMother’s first attempted parenting time. Youth A’s Probation\nOfficer expressed concern Youth A’s Mother had not\ncommunicated well at the beginning of the placement and also\nconfirmed that he was aware of subsequent successful visits after\nthe canceled one on 01/26/2025.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 03/19/2025. He\nrecalled interacting with Youth A’s Mother on 01/26/2025 when\nshe arrived to visit with Youth A. Staff 1 had been told Youth A\nwas placed on a room restriction because of concern that he had\nmade a weapon. Staff 1 recalled Youth A’s Mother being upset\nand requesting to speak with a supervisor at that time.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed over the phone on 3/19/2025. She\nrecalled interacting with Youth A on 01/26/2025 when it was\ndiscovered that he had sharpened a toothbrush while in his\nroom. Supervisor 1 confiscated the toothbrush from Youth A and\nasked what he had been doing with it. Youth A responded to her\nthat he had been bored and had not been intending to make a\nweapon. Supervisor 1 noted she did not know Youth A well at that\ntime because he had been placed at the facility less than two days\nearlier. In addition, Supervisor 1 recalled about an hour earlier\nYouth A had been doing cartwheels in the living area of the unit\nand had not been responding to staff directives. Supervisor 1\nreported explaining the resulting room restriction to Youth A, and\nhe did not argue or protest, nor did he mention the intended visit\nwith Youth A’s Mother. She recalled this incident occurring\n3",
    "minutes prior to Youth A’s mother arriving for the visitation with\nYouth A. Supervisor 1 later interacted with Youth A’s Mother\nwhen she arrived at the facility. Supervisor 1 recalled Youth A’s\nMother being upset but ultimately understanding, and they\ndiscussed when the next opportunity could occur for a visit with\nYouth A.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Incident report documentation from the facility dated\n01/26/2025 was provided and reviewed. The details in this\ndocumentation were consistent with the interviews provided\nby Youth A and Supervisor 1. The documentation was\ndated 01/26/2025 at 2:22 pm and the visit was scheduled to\nbegin at 2:30 pm.\n• Facility documentation provided showed in person visits\nbetween Youth A and his mother on the dates of\n01/29/2025 and 02/02/2025 during his placement at the\nfacility from 01/24/2025 through 02/04/2025.\n• Facility policy & procedures titled General Operating\nManagement was provided and reviewed.\no The Disciplinary System section explained what a\nModerate Violation of the facility’s behavior\nmanagement program was, including having\nrestricted items that could be potentially harmful to\nstaff or youth that could be considered\ncontraband. Youth can be placed on a room\nrestriction for this violation, beginning at a two-hour\nroom restriction.\no The section titled Resident In-Person Visitation\nexplained that “juveniles on room restriction during\nvisitation, lose their visitation privileges.” It also\nstated that “if parents cannot routinely visit during\none of the two visitation periods, they may contact a\nsupervisor to make special arrangements for\nvisitation.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed the facility allowed youth\nvisitation as required per the rule, as Youth A had a visit with his\nmother on 01/29/2025 within the first week of his placement\ndespite the canceled visit on 01/26/2025.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",

It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n03/24/2025\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 24, 2025\n________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
