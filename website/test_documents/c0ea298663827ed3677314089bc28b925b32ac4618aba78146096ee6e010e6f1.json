Most of the homes appear to be older, modest, single family dwellings.\nThe facility is a ranch style, wood-frame house with a front porch. It has aluminum\nsiding and an unfinished basement. It is 1300 sq. ft dwelling with two bedrooms and\nan unattached 1-car garage.\nThe house has sufficient space for housing 6 children, a staff office and storage for\nrecords and supplies.
