    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited\nto:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was placed in a headlock during a restraint attempt.\nInvestigation The Complainant was contacted on 07/24/2024 and had no\nadditional information to provide.\nYouth A was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 over the phone on\n07/22/2024. Youth A stated he had hit his own head on a window\nduring an escalation. He believed the window broke when he did\nthis. Afterwards Youth A recalled hearing Staff 4 direct him to go\nsit down away from the broken glass. Youth A stated Staff 4 then\ngrabbed him by the neck and threw him to the ground. Youth A\nstated he then bit Staff 4 to get Staff 4 off of him. Youth A also\nremembered accidentally kicking another staff member during the\nincident but could not identify who that was. Youth A could not\nrecall any other youth or staff that were present. He stated this all\noccurred in the hallway of one of the units. Youth A recalled\neventually calming down and then going to the hospital to ensure\nhe didn’t injure himself.\nAn attempt to interview Youth B with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility occurred on\n08/02/2024 as a possible witness to the incident, but Youth B\nrefused the interview.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 08/02/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She recalled\nwitnessing the incident in question first by hearing a commotion in\n2",
    "the lobby of the unit. She heard Youth A escalated and arguing\nwith Staff 4. Staff 1 encouraged him to go to another recreation\nroom, only for Youth A to throw his eyeglasses at her. Staff 1\nmoved out of the way and did not witness what occurred next, but\nwhen she turned back around, she had seen Youth A on the floor\nwith Staff 4 attempting to perform a restraint. At that point Staff 1\ncontinued to try to verbally de-escalate Youth A, and Youth A was\nnot responsive. He was kicking, spitting and threatening. Staff 4\nrecalled Youth A attempting to bite her and other staff members\nthat had come to assist. Staff 1 recalled Youth A having on a\nhooded sweatshirt and in the commotion, it had ridden up on his\nback and neck, and she attempted to move this back down so that\nit did not choke him. Staff 1 never witnessed any other staff\nmembers have Youth A in any position that resembled a headlock,\nnor did she hear Youth A state that he felt like he could not\nbreathe.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on\n08/02/2024 during an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility.\nSupervisor stated he reported to the incident after the restraint\nhad already begun and did not witness the preceding events. At\nthe time he arrived, Youth A was on the ground on his back\nfighting against a restraint effort by other staff. Supervisor 1\nstated Youth A was spitting and yelling, but he could not recall\nspecifically what Youth A was saying. He did recall Youth A was\nvery upset specifically at Staff 4, but Staff 4 was no longer\nphysically engaged with Youth A. Supervisor 1 stated he never\nsaw any staff member with their arms or bodies across Youth A,\nand never heard anything from Youth A about struggling to breath.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 08/02/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She\nrecalled Youth A being upset at the time she started her shift. She\nwitnessed him punch a door and state he was going to go to his\nroom, only then to stop in the hallway and throw his head\nbackwards into the glass window of the control room of the unit.\nStaff 2 recalled Youth A then throwing his glasses and getting in\nthe face of Staff 4, who was nearby. Staff 4 initiated a restraint,\nwhich quickly went to the ground with Youth A on his back and\nfighting back at any staff nearby. Despite the fighting back Staff 2\nrecalled that at no point was anyone laying on top of Youth A or\ndoing anything that would have resembled a headlock. She did\nrecall Youth A yelling many things, including “You’re hurting me,”\nbut Staff 2 did not know what that could have been caused by. As\nthe restraint continued, Youth A eventually de-escalated and Staff\n2 stayed with him. She recalled him expressing apologies for\n3",
    "charging at Staff 4, and at no point did he say anything about\nbeing choked or having trouble breathing during the restraint.\nYouth A did refer to his head hurting from hitting it on the window.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on\n08/02/2024 during an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility.\nHe stated that he became involved with Youth A during the\nincident in the middle of the restraint effort. Supervisor 2 recalled\nYouth A being in a supine position and he believed that staff were\nproperly attempting to hold Youth A’s arms and legs as he fought\nback against them. Supervisor 2 recalled Youth A turning his\nhead and attempting to bite Staff 4 multiple times. Upon seeing\nthis, Supervisor 2 moved to take the place of Staff 4 so that Staff 4\ncould remove himself from the situation. After a short amount of\ntime Youth A began to de-escalate and the restraint was released.\nSupervisor 2 stated that there were no points in time where Youth\nA was in a headlock and he did not see any staff have contact\nwith Youth A’s head, neck or chest. Supervisor 2 also commented\nthat Youth A was yelling and screaming as he was escalated, but\nhe never heard a comment about not being able to breathe.\nStaff 3 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 08/02/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated\nthat she saw Youth A punch a wall and then proceed to slam his\nown head backwards into a window. At that point Youth A turned\nhis attention to Staff 4 and was acting aggressively toward him,\nyelling threats and quickly moving into Staff 4’s personal space.\nAs this was occurring Staff 3 recalled Staff 4 instructing Youth A to\n“take a seat, you probably got hurt” referring to him slamming his\nhead. Youth A yelled in response “Make me, bitch!”, “I’m gonna\nbeat your ass” and “I’m going to punch you” to Staff 4. Staff 3\nrecalled seeing Staff 4 put his hand out to keep Youth A at arm’s\nlength, and Youth A walked into Staff 4’s hand. Staff 4 then\ninitiated a standing restraint on Youth A, which quickly fell to the\nground when Youth A fought back at Staff 4. Staff 3 stated she\nhelped hold Youth A’s legs during the floor restraint while he was\non his back, but this was difficult as he was kicking. She recalled\nseeing Staff 2 get kicked in the shoulder. Youth A did yell that he\ncould not breathe during the restraint, and Staff 3 noted he did not\nstop yelling for much of the restraint effort until he started to calm\ndown. Staff 3 recalled the restraint lasting a few more minutes\nuntil Youth A was able to calm down. Staff 3 never saw anyone\nhave Youth A in a chokehold or anyone laying over his chest or\nneck area that would have restricted breathing.\n4",
    "Staff 4 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n08/09/2024. He recalled the incident in question beginning\nbecause Youth A got upset about not being able to play a video\ngame. As Staff 4 attempted to reason with Youth A, he got more\nupset and punched a wall and eventually hit his own head on a\nwindow of the control room within the unit. Staff 4 recalled Youth\nA then yelling threats that he wanted to kill staff and cut himself.\nStaff 4 stated that he intentionally placed himself between Youth A\nand the broken window so that he could not get to any glass\nshards. Staff 4 recalled putting his hand out to protect his\npersonal space as Youth A advanced on him, telling Youth A to\ntake a seat. Youth A responded back “You don’t tell me to sit like\na dog.” Staff 4 stated to Youth A that if he continued to approach\nhim aggressively it would have to be taken as a physical threat.\nStaff 4 stated Youth A then quickly approached him, and he\ndecided to initiate a standing restraint. Staff 4 recalled not being\nable to do this successfully and because of Youth A’s aggression\nthey fell to the ground. He could not recall who, but another staff\nquickly helped Staff 4 ensure that Youth A was in a supine\nposition and they each held one of his arms in a restraint position.\nStaff 4 recalled Youth A continuing to be physically aggressive,\nand he believed Youth A bit him on the hand at one point. Staff 4\nrecalled other staff taking over verbal de-escalation attempts and\nhe was eventually swapped out so that he could leave the\nsituation. Staff 4 thought this was best because Youth A was\ncontinuing to direct verbal aggression specifically at him. During\nthe restraint Staff 4 was sure he never had Youth A in a\nchokehold, nor did he or any other staff have any sort of pressure\non Youth A’s neck or chest that would have restricted his\nbreathing.\nDuring a video conference on 08/14/2024 DHHS Worker 1\nprovided an update on her investigation and was not able to state\na final result at that time.\nVideo reviewed:\n• Two angles of concurrent security camera footage of the\n07/12/2024 incident were available. Both views allowed the\nlobby area of the unit to be seen. View #1 faced the control\nroom and door that led to the bedrooms and connecting\nhallway. View #2 faced the control room and outside exit of\nthe unit. In view #1 Youth A could be seen walking toward\nthe door to the bedroom hallway at 3:06:11 pm. He opened\nthe door and slammed it against the wall. Youth B then\nwalked past him and through the door towards the\nbedrooms. Youth A was then seen yelling and visibly\n5",
    "upset, with Staff 2 and Staff 4 approximately ten feet away\nfrom him. At 3:06:31 pm Youth A began to throw his head\nbackwards against the glass window of the unit, hitting it\nthree times. Staff 4 verbally addressed Youth A. Youth A\ncontinued to be visibly upset as he approached Staff 4, and\nat 3:07:07 Staff 4 attempted to perform a standing restraint\nof Youth A. While attempting to hold Youth A’s arms from\nbehind him, Youth A struggled back and within 20 seconds\nYouth A was on the floor with Staff 1 and Staff 2 attempting\nto assist. View #1 did not show Staff 4 having Youth A in\nany sort of headlock up to this point. In view #2 it could be\nseen that Youth A’s hooded sweatshirt was riding up on his\nupper body and back. View #2 showed Youth A being\ntaken to the ground by Staff 4 at 3:07:22 pm, resulting in\nStaff 4 on his knees above Youth A’s chest for\napproximately one minute. More staff came to assist as\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 could be seen holding Youth A’s legs.\nSupervisor 1 came in and replaced Staff 2 and Staff 3\nholding Youth A’s legs. As Youth A continued to struggle\nSupervisor 2 then helped Staff 4 disengage from Youth A.\nThe floor restraint lasted until 3:21:13 pm where Youth A\ncould be seen sitting up and receiving attention from\npresent staff.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Incident report documentation dated 07/12/2024 authored\nby Staff 4 was reviewed. It described that Youth A hit his\nhead on a window three times and then became more\naggressive towards Staff 4, first verbally and then\nphysically. Staff 4 attempted a standing restraint, only for\nthat to fail and for both individuals to fall to the ground.\nStaff 4 then wrote that a supine restraint was used with the\nassistance of other staff. Once the floor restraint ended\nYouth A was seen by a staff nurse and then transported to\nthe hospital for further evaluation for a possible head injury.\n• Personnel records for Staff 4 were reviewed. He was last\ntrained on the facility restraint model on 01/08/2024.
