    "summary": "A youth tested positive for marijuana upon arriving at a new placement after being discharged from Osceola Youth Center. An investigation, including interviews with the youth, other residents, staff, and leadership, found no evidence that the youth obtained or used marijuana while at the facility, concluding the positive test likely stemmed from her admitted daily use prior to placement. No substantiated culpability lies with the facility, as the investigation did not support the allegation that staff or youth provided marijuana or that use occurred on-site.",
