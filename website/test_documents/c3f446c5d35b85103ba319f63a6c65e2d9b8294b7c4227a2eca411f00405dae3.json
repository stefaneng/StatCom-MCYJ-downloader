She stated she did not feel safe there, alleging staff had\npreviously put their hands on her and choked her. Youth A\ndescribed a recent incident involving Staff 1. She stated she and\nother youth were lining up to attend a session called \"Chick Time.\"\nHowever, while walking over, Youth A reported she did not want to\nparticipate. Instead, she went to the family room, laid down on the\ncouch, and turned on the fan because she was feeling irritated.\nAccording to Youth A, Staff 1 entered the room and told her she\ncould not remain there, raising his voice in the process. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 also threatened to take away her 1:30 p.m. phone\ncall privilege. She stated she told Staff 1 not to yell at her because\nshe had not been yelling at him. Youth A reported she then got up,\napproached Staff 1, and pushed him. At that point, both Staff 1\nand Staff 2 grabbed her by the arms—one on each side.

According to her, Youth A reported what happened with\nStaff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3.

Shortly after,\nStaff 1 entered the room to redirect Youth A. Staff 2 reported Staff\n1 told Youth A she could not remain in the room and remained\ncalm and not rude during the interaction.

Several youths, including a group of girls, were observed\nlining up in the hallway. Youth A was then seen exiting the office\nand joining the line. Staff 1 was also present in the hallway,\nobserving the scene. After all youths left the hallway, Staff 1 exited\nthrough the double doors near the office.\nYouth A re-entered the area with three staff members and\nproceeded into the family room. Staff 1 came around the corner as\nthe third staff member exited. Staff 2 and Staff 3 entered the room\nwith Youth A, while Staff 1 stood in the doorway engaging in a\nconversation. The conversation continued for several minutes,\nthough the content was unclear as there is no sound.\nYouth A approached Staff 1 at the door and, after about 30\nseconds, attempted to close it. Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 tried to\nprevent the door from closing, but Youth A managed to shut it with\nStaff 2 inside and Staff 1 and Staff 3 left outside.\n5",

Staff 2 grabbed Youth A’s left arm,\nwhile her right hand continued to grip Staff 1.\nStaff 1 attempted to use the push-and-pull method to safely break\nfree. He moved toward Youth A, using a counter-intuitive\napproach, then pushed and tried to loosen her grip. Eventually, he\npulled away and successfully freed his shirt from her grasp.\nDuring this, Staff 3 was seen trying to protect Staff 1 from being\nstruck, while Staff 2 attempted to apply a physical management\nhold by wrapping her arms around Youth A’s arms.\nAfter freeing himself, Staff 1 returned to the office and attempted\nto close the door.

Another desk was later removed from the office. Youth A\neventually walked out of the office, followed by all three staff\nmembers.\nYouth A entered the gym, with the staff following behind. Inside\nthe gym, Youth A began throwing objects around. She then\nattempted to leave, but Staff 1 prevented her by standing in front\nof the door. Youth A walked around the gym, waving her arms and\nfollowing Staff 2, who maintained a defensive hand stance. Youth\nA then approached Staff 3, backing her into a corner and\npreventing her from leaving for approximately nine minutes. After\nallowing Staff 3 to leave the corner, Youth A again attempted to\nexit the gym. While Staff 1 continued to stand in front of the door,\nYouth A struck him in the head. Staff 1 then exited the gym. Youth\nA sat in the corner for about one minute. Another staff member\nentered the gym and hugged her, while Staff 3 exited. Staff 2 also\nleft the gym shortly afterward.
