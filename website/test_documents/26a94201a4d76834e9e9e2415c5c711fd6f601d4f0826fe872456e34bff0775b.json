INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Initial evaluation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12310\nSection • (3) The agency shall assess all the following:\nDescription\n• (c) Physical, mental, and emotional health of each\nmember of the household, including any history of\nsubstance use disorder or treatment.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency licensed a foster home in 2022. One of the foster parents\nhad substantial mental health history that included, but not limited\nto 20 hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and hallucinations. While\nthe agency did collect self-reported history, they did not do a\nthorough background check into this history given its seriousness.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on July 16, 2024.\nThere was no additional information to add.\nFoster Parent 1 & Foster Parent 2 were interviewed face to face\nby Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) worker on\nJune 21, 2024. Their attorney was present via telephone and\nadvised them not to answer any questions.\nDHHS Licensing Supervisor (DHHS LS) was interviewed via\nTeams on July 25, 2024. He stated Foster Parent 1 & Foster\nParent 2 have been licensed since April 2022. He stated Foster\nParent 1 has mental health history that includes hospitalizations,\nand she was open and honest about this with the agency during\nthe initial licensing process.\nDHHS LS stated during the initial licensing process there were\nconversations between he and DHHS Licensing Worker 2\nregarding Foster Parent 1’s mental health history. He couldn’t\nrecall specifics but stated DHHS Licensing Worker 2 would follow\nup with Foster Parent 1 and her current mental health providers if\nnecessary. He stated there was no discussion regarding obtaining\nFoster Parent 1’s mental health records but there were items\n2",
    "identified in the mental health evaluations that needed follow up\nand clarification regarding Foster Parent 1’s audio hallucinations\nand therefore, the licensing worker conducted a follow up call to\ndetermine the last time Foster Parent 1 was treated for audio\nhallucinations and DHHS Licensing Worker 2 did that. When the\nlicense was issued the email from Department of Child Welfare\nLicensing (DCWL) Central Office Licensing Consultant (COLC)\nwas complimentary regarding Foster Parent 1’s mental health\nassessment. He stated based on that feedback they felt they had\ndone a thorough job.\nHe stated Foster Parent 1 has mental health history and clarified\nthe majority of her mental health history was when she was in her\n20’s, as reported by Foster Parent 1. The information regarding\nher current mental health indicated she would not be a threat and\nis appropriate as far as staying on top of her treatment and being\nproactive seeking services if needed. He stated he doesn’t have a\nbackground in mental health and felt the statements obtained from\ncurrent providers were appropriate and didn’t feel he was in a\nposition to second guess the professional opinions of mental\nhealth providers. Therefore, mental health records were not\nobtained, but the mental health statements from current providers\nthat mention Foster Parent 1’s history was reviewed.\nDHHS LS stated the agency does not have a formal process when\nassessing a potential foster parent. He clarified that it is more of a\ncase-by-case basis since every situation is different. With criminal\nhistory, depending on what it is they would obtain police reports\nand any information to make an assessment. He stated they have\nreached out to DCWL COLC in the past to inquire if more is\nneeded and that has been helpful. No case is the same, so the\nagency assesses all information gathered and determines if more\nis needed. DHHS LS provided additional follow up and stated if he\nis uncertain about something he will reference licensing rules, the\ntechnical assistance manual or seek other resources such as\nminutes from licensing calls, responses he received for past report\nor questions or contact from DCWL COLC.\nDHHS Licensing Worker 1 (DHHS LW1) was interviewed via\nTeams on July 26, 2024. She stated she was assigned as the\nlicensing worker for the special investigations. The first one was\nregarding concerns that Foster Parent 1’s mental health wasn’t\nthoroughly reported and assessed during the initial evaluation.\nThe second one was regarding a mental health episode Foster\nParent 1 had and if she was fit to continue to be a licensed foster\nparent.\n3",
    "The first evaluation she completed was regarding Foster Parent\n1’s mental health in June 2023. She did a thorough review of the\nprovider record and the information, documentation and interviews\nDHHS Licensing Worker 2 obtained during the initial assessment.\nShe stated she reviewed updated and new medical and mental\nhealth statements that were completed as part of the adoption\nassessment. She also reviewed the mental health records for\nFoster Parent 1 that were hundreds of pages and reported she\nobtained these from Foster Parent 1. She stated there was some\nconflicting information in the records. For example, one record\nindicated Foster Parent 1 had a history of physical abuse as a\nchild and others didn’t state this. Another example, she was\nmarried to a man but actually had a girlfriend. She stated Foster\nParent 1 was very transparent with the extent of her mental health\nhistory, ongoing treatment, medication and therapy during the\ninitial evaluation and also the special evaluations. Any information\nthat was not included initially did not appear to be intentional.\nDHHS Licensing Worker 2 (DHHS LW2) was interviewed via\nTeams on July 30, 2024. She stated she is the assigned licensing\nworker for Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2. She completed\nthe initial home assessment when they were licensed in 2022 and\ncompleted any subsequent reevaluations. She stated Foster\nParent 1 was forthcoming from the beginning regarding her mental\nhealth history and has been consistent with the information\nthroughout their working relationship. During the initial licensing\nprocess Foster Parent 1 reported she had been hospitalized due\nto her mental health approximately 20 times. She provided\ninformation regarding her diagnosis, medications she was taking,\nand family history.\nDHHS LW2 stated during the initial licensing process she starts\nwith orientation and informs potential foster parents they will be\ndiscussing medical health and mental health history. She couldn’t\nrecall exactly but is assuming that is when Foster Parent 1\ninformed her of her medical and mental health history. She stated\nshe was initially concerned when Foster Parent 1 informed her of\nthe number of past hospitalizations due to mental health but\nadvised most of the hospitalizations occurred when she was in her\nearly 20’s which was approximately 20 years ago. This was\nreported by Foster Parent 1. Her brain was still developing and\ngetting a handle on her mental health. Later hospitalizations, the\n2018 hospitalization for example were more preventative\nmeasures according to her doctors. Foster Parent 1 has had a\ngood grasp on her mental health since then and is aware when\n4",
    "she needs additional help or a medication check and this is also\nreported by her doctors.\nDHHS LW2 stated she was not concerned regarding Foster\nParent 1 not reporting or under reporting any information\nregarding her mental health history because she had obtained\ncurrent statements from providers she was working with for a long\ntime. She stated it’s not required of her to obtain records to\ncompare them with what was being reported. If she had been\nasked by DCWL COLC to obtain more information she would have\nbut didn’t feel it was necessary based on the information she\nalready had and the follow up she did with Foster Parent 1 and\nher therapist. She felt she had a good grasp with what was going\non with Foster Parent 1.\nDHHS LW2 said when she is working on licensing a home and\ninformation is reported, she will follow policy and licensing rules in\nregard to when she requests additional information and when she\ndoesn’t. She stated if someone reports something, and it doesn’t\nmake sense, or she feels like she isn’t getting enough information,\nthen she will request additional information.\nFor mental health their office uses the mental health statement.\nShe stated if there was something on the mental health statement\nthat indicated Foster Parent 1 would not be appropriate to care for\nfoster children from her provider, she would request more\ninformation. She stated their office also follows what is in the\ntechnical assistance manual, licensing rules or any follow up\nrequested by her supervisor or DCWL. She stated DCWL\ncomplimented her on her assessment of Foster Parent 1’s mental\nhealth history.\nDCWL Central Office Program Manager (DCWL COPM) was\ninterviewed on August 14, 2024. She stated the license for Foster\nParent 1 & 2 was opened in 2022. In reviewing attachments to the\n3130 there were multiple practitioners that indicated there were no\nbarriers that would impact Foster Parent 1’s ability to foster.\nDCWL COPM clarified documentation received was from recent\nand current practitioners.\nThe mental health practitioners outlined Foster Parent 1’s history,\nnot just self-account from Foster Parent 1. The history is\nmentioned by two mental health practitioners and her doctor. One\nfrom one inpatient stay in 2018 and one from ongoing the mental\nhealth practitioner for therapeutic services. Ottawa DHHS was\nprovided clear documentation from practitioners who have\n5",
    "ongoing responsibility to assess compliance with treatment and\nFoster Parent 1’s benefit from treatment and they assessed her to\nbe stable.\nThe 3130 has been updated since this home study and it now has\nanother area that goes deeper and asks for an explanation for\nhow the diagnosis presented prior to and after treatment so there\nis a clearer picture regarding triggers.\nDCWL Central Office Consultant (DCWL COLC) was\ninterviewed on August 14, 2024. She stated the 3130 was not a\nreport she had to go back and ask for more documentation. DHHS\nLW2 did follow up with a medical doctor to confirm the\nschizoaffective as opposed to the bipolar diagnosis and made the\nappropriate calls to the doctor to get clarification. DCWL COLC\nstated If she sees something that isn’t covered in the medical\nstatement she will send back and ask for more\ninformation/documentation.\nDCWL COLC stated she reviews the social history including\ntrauma and what is going on regarding what they are saying the\nmental health diagnosis is. On technical guidance calls held\nmonthly regarding the medical/mental health, agencies are asked\nto pull records from hospitals.\nCompliance was determined from a doctor in a psychiatric\nhospital, who was able to give certification going back to 2018 for\nFoster Parent 1. When reviewing the form, they said yes to all\nareas to applicant being able to process and work with\ntraumatized children including the licensed social worker doing\ncurrent therapeutic sessions with her. One of the things she noted\nwith Foster Parent 1’s mental health history was that many of the\ninpatient mental health hospitalizations occurred during\nadolescence through early adulthood. DCWL COLC indicated,\nbased on information and documentation reviewed, Foster Parent\n1 was stabilized and working with mental health providers and\nwas aware of her diagnoses and things she needs to do that\nimpacts her diagnosis and ongoing self-care. The doctor who\nsigned off on the medical went back and made an assessment on\nthe most recent hospitalization in 2018 and she was able to\nunderstand all the mental health records and gave the actual ok\nthat Foster Parent 1 could be a foster parent and that is what\nDCWL reviewed. One of the considerations from doctors and how\nthey work through that mental health history is taking into\nconsideration whether or not the individual is compliant. In this\n6",
    "scenario the doctors said yes and there was a plan for how to deal\nwith her mental health.\nThe form the doctor completed noted she assessed Foster Parent\n1’s history going back through the most recent hospitalization. The\ntechnical guidance DCWL gives is they weigh the medical history\nthrough the past 5 years. DCWL looked at the last 5 years and\ngathered documentation for this period and she did not require\nthem to speak to anything prior. Ottawa contacted Foster Parent\n1’s doctor and that is what is required in terms of DCWL weighing\nthe rules and determining compliance.\nThere is one mental health statement that mentions her 2018\nhospitalization. Another one states her first hospitalization was in\n1998 and most recent in 2018. Another mental health statement\nreports she was hospitalized approximately 20 times total. The\nstatements are brief with little detail.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• 3130 completed on 4/18/2022: (reviewed in CWLM &\nMISACWIS. The mental health information that is\nreferenced and uploaded are mental health statements.\nThere are no mental health records).\nFoster Parent 1 receives Social Security Disability due to a\ndiagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder, unspecified bipolar disorder,\nand general anxiety disorder. Medical and mental health\nstatements were obtained from Foster Parent 1’s providers.\nAll three providers stated Foster Parent 1 does not have a\nphysical or mental health condition that would adversely\naffect the care of a foster child. Foster Parent 1 shares she\nwas diagnosed in her early 20s and has learned to manage\nher diagnosis effectively with therapy, medications, and\nself-care.\nSection 9 Health: Both household members are in good\nphysical, mental, and emotional health currently. Does\nanyone in the household have a physical or mental\nhealth diagnosis or condition that would make care of\nthe child difficult? If so, describe how it may affect the\ncare of a child. No one in the household has a physical or\nmental health diagnosis or condition that would make care\nof a foster child difficult.\nMedical statements & mental health evaluations.\n• On 01/17/2022, a medical statement was completed for\nFoster Parent 1 by a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O).\nThe signed statement indicated Foster Parent 1 was\n7",
    "treated for diverticulitis in 2009 and 2021, kidney stones in\n2019, and depression with hospitalization in 2018 following\nher father's death. She is currently being treated for bipolar\nand following up with a psychiatrist. The signed statement\nindicates that Foster Parent 1 does not require any special\ncare and does not have a known condition that would\nadversely affect the care of a foster child.\n• On 01/17/2022, a mental health evaluation was completed\nfor Foster Parent 1 by a psychiatric hospital. Foster Parent\n1 began services in September 2021 and is currently being\nseen for Bipolar 1 disorder, unspecified bipolar disorder,\nand generalized anxiety disorder. Foster Parent 1 was last\nseen on 01/17/2022. Foster Parent 1 was hospitalized for\nthe above conditions in 1998 and has had approximately 20\nhospitalizations. Her last hospital stay was in 2018. To the\nbest ability, Foster Parent 1 is able to understand,\nremember, and carry out short, simple and detailed\ninstructions; make judgments on simple work-related\ndecisions; interact appropriately with the public; and\nrespond to children with empathy and sympathy. It is\nbelieved that Foster Parent 1 is able to appropriately\nhandle and interact with children who have unique\nproblems of trauma history and adjustment, impulse\ncontrol, ADHD, problems managing aggression and anger,\ndepression, and medical concerns. It is believed that Foster\nParent 1 can interact appropriately with the public, social,\nand health agencies and is able to accept rejection from a\nchild. The signed statement indicated Foster Parent 1 does\nnot require any special care and does not have a known\ncondition that could affect the care of a foster child. Foster\nParent 1 is prescribed medications. It was noted that Foster\nParent 1 experiences the side effect of sleepiness from\nnighttime sleep medications.\n• On 01/18/2022, a mental health evaluation was completed\nfor Foster Parent.

Foster Parent 1 is able to\nunderstand, remember, and carry out short, simple and\ndetailed instructions; make judgments on simple work-\n8",
    "related decisions; interact appropriately with the public; and\nrespond to children with empathy and sympathy.

It was assessed that\nFoster Parent 1 can interact appropriately with the public,\nsocial, and health agencies and is able to accept rejection\nfrom a child. The signed statement indicated Foster Parent\n1 does not require any special care and does not have a\nknown condition that could affect the care of a foster child.\n• On 04/13/2022, a letter was received from a therapist\nclarifying Foster Parent 1’s schizoaffective disorder\ndiagnosis. The diagnosis was in Foster Parent 1's file,\nwhen Foster Parent 1 first started attending this office\nseveral years ago. It is believed the diagnosis of bipolar\ndisorder is more accurate as, in the therapists observation,\nFoster Parent 1 only reports audio hallucinations during\ntimes of mood disturbance/extreme stress.\n• On 04/13/2022, a follow up phone call was placed by\nDHHS LW2 to determine when the last time was that\nFoster Parent 1 experienced audio hallucinations. This\noccurred around the time of Foster Parent 1’s stepfather's\nhospitalization and death. During this time, Foster Parent 1\nalso had the additional stress of attending college and\nworking full time. Foster Parent 1 is very aware of her mood\nstates and always knows when it's time to seek help\nincluding medication changes, increased counseling, or\nother interventions.\n• During the home visit on 02/10/2022, Foster Parent 1\nstated her hospitalizations, other than the stay in 2018,\nwere all in her early teens and 20s, when she was still\ngetting a handle on her diagnosis. She shared that she\nadmitted herself in 2018, when her stepfather passed\naway, more as a precautionary measure due to her past\nmental health issues. Foster Parent 1 stated her mental\nhealth is very well managed now, and she plans to continue\ncounseling and medication management.\n• A follow up response was received from Foster Parent 1 on\n04/13/2022 indicating that, prior to 2018, Foster Parent 1\nwas last hospitalized during a particularly stressful time in\nher life that also coincided with the loss of her only\nremaining ovary and the hormonal changes affected her\nand her mental health. She does not remember the exact\ndate, but believes it was the Spring/Summer of 2010.\n9",
    "• On 04/13/2022, a medication list was received for Foster\nParent 1. Foster Parent 1 is prescribed Lorazepam, 1 mg\ndaily, as needed for anxiety; Valtrex 500 mg, 2 times daily\nas needed for cold sores; Wellbutrin 150 mg for seasonal\ndepression, Foster Parent 1 shared she takes this in the\nWinter but does not normally need it in the Spring and\nSummer when she can be outdoors more. Seroquel 300\nmg daily for bipolar disorder; Lipitor 20mg daily for high\ncholesterol.\n• Summary of strengths and areas of growth, attention.\nLCW 2 has found Foster Parent 1 & 2 to be very loving and\ndedicated to each other, their family, and serving others.\nThey have an adequate understanding of the foster care\nprocess and are willing to work with the agency, the\nparents, and the children. Their life experiences, their\nwillingness to help others, and their dedication to their\nfamily indicates they would have the ability to help a child\nunderstand the dynamics of being fostered and/or adopted\nand raised by family. At this time, LCW 2 does not believe\nFoster Parent 1 & 2 have any areas of growth that need to\nbe attended to prior to caring for a child. LCW 2 believes\nFoster Parent 1 & 2 are willing, able, and open to learning\nand growing as foster parents.\n• 1998 mental health records.

What is the basis for\nthe disability? What are the limitations they may\nhave based on that disability and the physician’s\ninput? Are the limitations of the stated disability\nconsistent with any known employment? For\nexample, the disability is for back problems, but the\nperson has some part time employment that would\ntypically require lifting.\n• Are they prescribed medications? What are the\nmedications?

Do they need a current psychological\nassessment?\n• June 2018 Foster home licensing monthly teleconference\ncall notes.\n“The challenges, stressors, and history of help-seeking\nsubsection of the family life section in the 3130 notes that\nthe applicant or AHHM has previous history of challenges or\nhelp-seeking that include current or past (last 5 years)\ninpatient or outpatient therapy/treatment, or that the person\nis currently prescribed medication to treat a mental health\nissue; however this is not mentioned in the health section of\nthe 3130 and there is no information or assessment from the\nprovider/physician, etc.”\n• CWL 3500: 3130 Packet Review Tool (for optional use).\nPage 4: “Verbal or written report was received from mental\nhealth provider if seen within past 5 years.”\n• April 19, 2022, email sent from DCWL COLC to DHS\nLicensing supervisor. “Thank you for the through mental\nhealth assessment and review of the medical source\ndocuments and after reviewing them, going back to the\napplicant to discuss and to include those assessment and\nfindings in the evaluation, this is excellent.”\nAnalysis The agency followed guidance provided during a monthly foster\nhome licensing teleconference meeting, DCWL 3130 report tool\nand feedback provided by DCWL upon submitting the initial\nevaluation of Foster Parent 1 & 2. Therefore, there is no citation.\n12",
    "Technical Assistance\nThe agency should ensure that the entirety of someone’s long\nmental health history be assessed, not just the recent past.\nRecords from prior providers, discharge summaries from\nhospitalizations, etc. should be requested and reviewed to ensure\nproper follow up recommendations were complied with to assess\nthe long-term stability and adherence to mental health\nprofessional’s advice.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code License recommendation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12325\nSection • (1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nDescription appropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained\nin the foster home evaluation and any special evaluations.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Special evaluation findings are not consistent with the facts.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on July 16, 2024.\nThere was no additional information to add.\nDHHS Licensing supervisor (DHHS LS) was interviewed via\nTeams on July 25, 2024. He stated foster parents have been\nlicensed since April 2022. He stated Foster Parent 1 has mental\nhealth history that includes hospitalizations, and she was open\nand honest about this from the start of the licensing process.\nHe stated there were concerns regarding Foster Parents 1 & 2\ncalling D.A Blodgett (DAB) too often. He stated once the case\nmoved to adoption there were concerns reported. He stated, in\ngeneral, there seems to be some differences between foster care\nand adoption in terms of foster parents being appropriate for\nplacement, but questions arose once it moved to adoption.\nHe stated his office opened two special investigations based on\nconcerns reported. The first one in June 2023 was regarding, in\npart, concerns about the number of medical appointments for\n13",
    "children who were placed in their home at the time and also\nFoster Parent 1’s mental health. He stated D.A Blodgett requested\na meeting and he had the impression they wanted to interrogate\nso he requested their questions in advance to be prepared with\nresponses. Based on those concerns Ottawa DHHS opened a\nspecial investigation. He stated Foster Parent 1 completed a\nparenting assessment and a psychological evaluation. He stated\nhe believed she did this in response to the concerns brought up by\nDA Blodgett. DA Blodgett also brought up concerns regarding\nitems contained in Foster Parent 1’s mental health records were\nentirely consistent with the information Foster Parent 1 provided\nduring the initial licensing process. DHHS LS stated there were\nalso some inconsistencies within the mental health records that\ndon’t appear to apply to Foster Parent 1. He provided an example\nwhere it was documented Foster Parent 1 was previously married\nand had a baby and neither were accurate. He stated the second\nspecial investigation in October 2023 was due to concerns of\nFoster Parent 1’s mental health and a statement she made\naccusing Foster Parent 2 of being a child molester. He stated they\nwere forthcoming about updating the agency on what is taking\nplace.\nThey were found in compliance with both investigations. He\nstated, in general, he will review and if additional information or\nclarification is needed, he will go back to the worker. If a narrative\nis provided and gives rise to more questions, then follow up is\nneeded to address the questions. He stated the issues regarding\nFoster Parent 1’s mental health issues were a little more difficult\ndue to being less concrete. He stated he felt DHHS LW1 was\nthorough and detail oriented.\nDHHS Licensing Worker 1 (LW1) was interviewed via Teams on\nJuly 26, 2024. She stated she was assigned as the licensing\nworker for the special investigations. The first one was regarding\nconcerns that Foster Parent 1’s mental health wasn’t thoroughly\nreported and assessed during the initial evaluation. The second\none was regarding a mental health episode Foster Parent 1 had\nand if she was fit to continue to be a licensed foster parent. She\nstated the concerns regarding the number of medical\nappointments for foster children who were previously placed in the\nhome was not part of the investigations she completed.\nShe stated the communication between DA Blodgett was not\nconsistent with Foster Parents 1 & 2. She stated at one point DA\nBlodgett said Foster Parents 1 & 2 were communicating too often\nand then they had concerns they weren’t communicating enough.\n14",
    "Her understanding is the number of medical appointments were\nnot related to concerns with Foster Parent 1’s mental health. She\nstated her understanding was DA Blodgett was missing some of\nthe documentation from the appointments that occurred, and they\nquestioned a diagnosis. They questioned the number of\nappointments, but it wasn’t correlated to Foster Parent 1’s mental\nhealth.\nThe first evaluation she completed was regarding Foster Parent\n1’s mental health. She did a thorough review of the provider\nrecord and the information, documentation and interviews DHHS\nLW2 obtained during the initial assessment. She stated she\nreviewed updated and new medical and mental health statements\nthat were completed as part of the adoption assessment. She also\nreviewed the mental health records for Foster Parent 1 that were\nhundreds of pages. She stated there was some conflicting\ninformation in the records. For example, one record indicated\nFoster Parent 1 had a history of physical abuse as a child and\nothers didn’t state this. Another example, she was married to a\nman but actually had a girlfriend.\nShe stated Foster Parent 1 was very transparent with the extent of\nher mental health history, ongoing treatment, medication and\ntherapy during the initial evaluation and also the special\nevaluations. Any information that was not included initially did not\nappear to be intentional. She stated DA Blodgett would not\nprovide her Foster Parent 1’s mental health records. She had to\nget those from Foster Parent 1. She stated Foster Parent 1\nobtained those herself and provided those to DA Blodgett as part\nof the adoption assessment.\nThe second special evaluation was about the time Youth A, Youth\nB and Youth C were being moved in September 2023. The\nprocess of moving Youth A, Youth B and Youth C out of the\nFoster Parent 1 & 2’s house was long and drawn out. The\nrationale for moving them was DA Blodgett planned on placing\nYouth A, Youth B and Youth C with a relative. The relative\nhowever, withdrew from placement. Foster Parent 1 had a mental\nhealth episode but that was not the documented reason the\nchildren were moved. The primary documented reason was that a\nrelative was willing to take all 3. Secondary reason was due to\nFoster Parent 1’s mental health concerns.\nShe stated she has a current investigation and for this\ninvestigation she is reviewing service plans and there are ongoing\nconcerns with Foster Parents 1 & 2 but there is not any\n15",
    "documentation regarding what the specific concerns are. She\nstated there was a lot of tension between the PAFC agency and\nFoster Parents 1 & 2 and the working relationship had\ndeteriorated.\nShe stated during the recent mental health crisis Foster Parents 1\n& 2 followed their plan. She stated the majority of Foster Parent\n1’s hospitalizations occurred when she was in her 20’s. Foster\nParent 1’s providers have stated she is very in tune with her\nmental health and her needs. Other than the most recent one last\nyear the next hospitalization was in 2018 when a family member\npassed away. As she has matured, she has become more self-\naware of her past trauma and triggers. She stated the overall\nnumber of hospitalizations looks bad but in the context of when\nthey happened and what she has done since then it provides a\nclearer picture of the true state of her mental health.\nThroughout her special evaluations she had a number of\nconversations with DHHS LS to assess her current status of her\nmental health, her mental health history, what her current\nproviders report and if she is compliant with her treatment. She\nstated she feels the agency thoroughly addressed the concerns.\nThe safety plan among Foster Parents 1 & 2 is something they\ndeveloped amongst themselves, and it was not something an\nagency determined was necessary. All of her findings supported\nthat Foster Parent 1 had a good handle on her mental health and\nit wasn’t an active concern for the children’s wellbeing.\nJust prior to the most recent hospitalization, Foster Parent 1\nidentified her anxiety was increasing and the crisis was coming.\nFoster Parents 1 & 2 had planned a trip and were on their way.\nFoster Parent 1 recognized she wasn’t able to go on the trip and\nthey contacted their support people. Foster Parent 1 went and\nstayed with her mom and stayed away from the kids as much as\npossible. Support people assisted Foster Parent 2 with Youth A,\nYouth B and Youth C.\nShe stated during her involvement there was never anything\nexpressed from DA Blodgett that there were safety concerns with\nYouth A, Youth B and Youth C. In reading the Foster Care Review\nBoard (FCRB) findings, DA Blodgett acknowledged Youth A,\nYouth B and Youth C were safe with Foster Parents 1 & 2 and\nthey had no concerns for their safety and well-being in the home.\n16",
    "She stated the concerns of a suicide attempt in 2023 by Foster\nParent 1 is not accurate. She stated one mental health record\nstates Foster Parent 1 made an attempt to cut her throat but later\nin the same document there is no documentation of there being\nany marks or cuts during her physical exam. She stated Foster\nParent 1 denied a suicide attempt and felt pressured by intake\nstaff who told her she needed a reason to be there and if she\nwasn’t suicidal they couldn’t help her and she knew she needed\nthe help but was not suicidal.\nFoster Parent 1 made a comment or accusation and called Foster\nParent 2 a child molester. She stated Foster Parent 1 was in a\ndiluted state when she said that. Foster Parent 2 and Foster\nParent 1’s mother took her to the hospital and when staff were\nquestioning her about Foster Parent 1’s state of mind and\nbehavior Foster Parent 2 made the statement that Foster Parent 1\nsaid that. Foster Parent 1 later said it was a loose association with\nsomeone they know that have children who have a history of\nbeing sexually abused and because Foster Parent 2 is friends with\nthem. She later stated it doesn’t make any sense now that she\nhas a clear head but at the time it did make sense. She was in a\nparanoid, delusional state of mind.\nFoster Parent 1 recently completed a parental fitness evaluation\nthrough a psychiatric hospital that was completed in October 2023\nafter the most recent hospitalization. Foster Parent 1 did that\nvoluntarily.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• SI 2023C0000724, intake 6/20/2023, completed 9/5/2023.\nAllegations: Licensing Complaint received that foster parent\ndid not disclose mental health information during the\nlicensing process. Analysis: Additionally, at the time of\nlicensure, the agency had medical and mental health\nstatements completed by Foster Parent 1's providers\nindicating that Foster Parent 1 met all licensing\nrequirements pertaining to her mental and physical health.\n• The DCWL consultant who approved the CWL-3130\nindicated she felt a thorough assessment of Foster Parent\n1’s mental health had been completed by the agency. Post-\nlicensure, Foster Parent 1 has kept her licensing worker\ninformed of changes in her mental health treatment and\nhas provided her with updated medication lists. She signed\na release of information form on 4/19/23 that allowed social\nservices workers from D.A. Blodgett to obtain her mental\nhealth records as well as mental health statements from\n17",
    "her providers, and she signed a release of information on\n6/27/23 allowing this worker to review her mental health\nrecords.\nRecommendation: Compliant.\n• SI 2024C0001023SE, intake 10/13/2023, completed\n1/5/2024. Allegations: Complaint regarding foster parent\nbeing accused of being a child molester. No specific or\nadditional details provided. In addition, concerns about\nmental health of other foster parent.\nCFH Rule 400.9201 Foster home applicant /licensee\nqualifications; central registry check (1) A foster home\napplicant or licensee must meet all the following\nqualifications: (d) Have the physical, mental, and emotional\nhealth to ensure appropriate care of children.\nAnalysis: (Worker’s assessment of information gathered) A\nreview of recent mental health records and documents\npertaining to Foster Parent 1 along with information\ngathered through interviews with the licensees supports the\nnotion that Foster Parent 1 has the physical, mental, and\nemotional health to ensure appropriate care of children as\nrequired by this licensing rule. Foster Parent 1 has a long\nand well-documented history of mental health\nissues/diagnoses. Foster Parent 1 has been very\ntransparent with agency staff about both her current and\nhistorical mental health treatment, and both she and Foster\nParent 2 have worked hard to ensure it has had minimal\neffect on the children who were placed in their care. Foster\nParent 1 is very self-aware of her mental health and has\nremained committed to treatment through medication\ncompliance and routine appointments with a therapist and\npsychiatrist. When Foster Parent 1 began to decompensate\ndue to the significant stress she felt from the agency\ndecision to have the children moved from her home, she\nand Foster Parent 2 successfully implemented and followed\ntheir pre-established safety plan. Foster Parent 1 & 2 relied\non their support system of family, friends, and child welfare\nprofessionals to ensure the safety of the children and that\nthe children’s needs were met when Foste Parent 1’s\nmental health started to deteriorate, and they sought\nprofessional mental health interventions when their informal\nsupports did not adequately meet Foster Parent 1’s needs.\nFoster Parent 1 had minimal contact with the children while\nshe was going through her mental health episode; any\ncontact she did have with the children during this time was\n18",
    "brief and under the supervision of an appropriate caregiver.\nA review of the mental health records associated with the 2\ninpatient hospitalizations and the 2 partial hospitalizations\nfor Foster Parent 1 that occurred from August-October\n2023 showed a clear positive progression of Foster Parent’\n1’s mental health during this time; she responded well to\ntreatment, and her mental health stabilized. On 10/23/23,\nFoster Parent 1 voluntarily completed a Parental Fitness\nEvaluation with a doctor. In his assessment of Foster\nParent 1, the doctor stated that “her continuity of care and\nopenness to treatment is remarkable and a strong marker\nfor better health and stability in the future,” and that “she\nshows good judgement and ownership of her role as a\nfoster parent as well as caring for her mental and physical\nhealth.” Additionally, the doctor stated “I have little concern\nthat her commitment to evidence-based care or willingness\nto take appropriate steps for higher levels of care if needed\nwill continue. As such, Foster Parent 1 appears to have the\nknowledge and skills along with appropriate management\nof mental health and concern for her foster children that\nwould indicate she is a fit parent and does not pose an\nundue risk of harm to those in her care.” Mental health\nstatements were also obtained from Foster Parent 1’s long-\ntime therapist, as well as from a doctor. Both the therapist\nand doctor indicated they believe Foster Parent 1 is able to\nappropriately handle and interact with public/social/health\nagencies as well as children who have unique problems of\ntrauma history and adjustment, impulse control, ADHD,\nproblems managing aggression and anger, depression, and\nmedical concerns. Despite her long history with mental\nhealth struggles, it is believed that Foster Parent 1 has a\ngood handle on her mental/emotional health, and that she\nhas sufficient services, supports, and self-awareness to\nhelp ensure that any potential mental health\ndecompensation in the future does not negatively affect the\ncare of any children who may be placed in her home.\nConclusion: Violation Not Established\n• 2023 mental health records. Foster Parent 1 was admitted\nto a psychiatric hospital from 8/7/2023-8/14/2023 due to\nsuicidal ideations and psychotic symptoms. She had\nattempted to cut her throat the morning of admittance and\nreported regularly occurring auditory hallucinations.
