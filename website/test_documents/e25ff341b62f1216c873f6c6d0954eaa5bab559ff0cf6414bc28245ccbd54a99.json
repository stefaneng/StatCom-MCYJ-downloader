EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first CAP was approved on 9/15/2021 and was submitted in response to the\n2021 licensing renewal inspection report dated 9/3/2021. The agency staff have\nachieved and maintained compliance in 4 of the 10 areas addressed in that CAP.\nAgency staff have failed to achieve or maintain compliance in the remaining 6 areas\nas evidenced by repeat citations documented in this report which will be addressed\nthrough a new corrective action plan. The agency staff have had difficulty\nmaintaining compliance in areas such as obtaining signatures timely and timely\ncompletion of forms due to low staffing and frequent placement crisis resulting in\nstaff having to spend time supervising youth while working on locating appropriate\nplacement.\nThe second CAP was approved on 7/28/2022 and was submitted in response to SIR\n2022C0112018 in which Rule 400.12404(1) was violated when a minor was placed\nin an adult foster care home despite a variance not being approved by LARA or\nDCWL. The agency staff are currently in compliance with this CAP as evidenced by\nfile review of the only youth currently placed in an AFC containing documentation\nthat the required variances were obtained prior to the placement.\nChief Administrator Assessment – The chief administrator assessment was\ndiscussed during the entrance meeting. The chief administrator accurately identified\n13",
    "areas in which staff have struggled to maintain compliance due to staffing and\nplacement concerns.\nInterviews – One of the foster care staff interviewed reported a positive experience\nworking at the agency, despite the internal and external stressors related to staffing\nand local placement concerns. The other foster care staff interviewed expressed\nconcerns with the ability to communicate and collaborate with upper management\nand conveyed concerns with the lack of staff recruitment and retention efforts made\nby the agency. No other concerns were raised by staff.\nVII. ANALYST CONCERNS\nNo safety concerns were identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\n9/1/2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 1, 2022___________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n14"
