Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nStaff invaded a resident’s personal space by touching her hair and shoulders in a\nmocking way. Resident asked staff to stop. Staff grounded resident because she\nwanted to call her mentor. There is a concern staff being physically aggressive and\nverbally abusive.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews\nOn 11/13/2020 I interviewed Staff 2 and Staff 3 by phone. Staff 2 reported that she\nwas working at the time of the incident but was in the staff office and did not see the\nincident. Staff 3 reported that she was helping a resident work on a puzzle when she\nheard Staff 1 and Resident A talking to one another in the hallway. Staff 3 reported\nthat she heard Resident A say, “leave me alone,” but she thought they were just\njoking around and playing with one another because Resident A plays around a lot\nwith staff. Staff 3 stated that she had her back to them for most of the interaction, so\nshe didn’t see much. When she did turn to face them, Resident A was saying “stop\ntouching me” to Staff 1, but Resident A was not near Staff 1 at that time.\n3",
    "On 11/13/2020 I interviewed Residents A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H via TEAMS due to\na pending Covid-19 test. Resident A reported that she returned to the home after\nwork and asked Staff 1 if she could take her shower last because her hair takes\nlonger to wash than the other girls. Staff 1 told her that she had to go first, so\nResident A told her that she might take longer than she was allowed. Staff 1 then\ntold her she would get grounded if she took too long. Resident A stated that she\ncame out of the bathroom within her allotted time and Staff 1 started waving her\nhands in Resident A’s face saying, “see, you had enough time.” Resident A stated\nthat she is triggered by people touching her without permission and she became\nupset when Staff 1 started touching her hair and putting her hands in Resident A’s\nface. Resident A stated that she asked Staff 1 politely to stop touching her and to\nleave her alone, but she didn’t. Resident A stated that Staff 1 was blocking the\ndoorway, so Resident A pushed Staff 1’s hand away and tried to get around her.\nStaff 1 lost her balance, then used both of her hands to push Resident A’s back\ncausing Resident A to stumble. Resident A stated that she felt that Staff 1 pushed\nher because she was taken aback by Resident A hitting her hand. She felt as if Staff\n1 was antagonizing her when she knew Resident A was already upset. Resident A\nstated that she feels safe in the home and does not feel that Staff 1 was trying to\nhurt her.\nResidents B, D, G, and H were present in the home and heard the interaction but did\nnot see what took place. Residents E and F, saw the interaction as described by\nResident A, but did not report that Staff 1 pushed Resident A. Resident C described\nthe events as reported by Resident A, including seeing Staff 1 use two hands to\npush Resident A on the back, as she walked away from Staff 1, causing Resident A\nto stumble.\nStaff 1 started the interview by stating that she took full responsibility for her actions.\nShe stated that Resident A wanted to take her shower last, but Staff 1 told her she\nhad to go first because other residents were doing their jobs. Resident A told her\nthat she was going to go over her time if she had to go first, so Staff 1 told her there\nwould be a consequence if she went over her allotted time which would be the same\nwhether she went first or last. Resident A came out of the shower in time and Staff 1\nsaid, “see, you had plenty of time.“ Resident A laughed and smiled then, but as she\ngot close to the end of the hall where she could see her peers “a switch flipped” and\nshe started yelling “leave me alone.” Staff 1 stated that she made a mistake and\n“continued to play.” She reported that she extended both of her arms to the sides,\nblocking the hallway, at which time Resident A pushed Staff 1’s left shoulder. Staff 1\nresponded by shoving her hand away playfully. Staff 1 denied ever putting her hands\nin Resident A’s face or touching her in any other way.\nOn 11/13/2020 I interviewed the Home Supervisor by phone. She was not present at\nthe time of the incident, but Staff 1 told her that she was “playing” with Resident A\nand, when Resident A hit Staff 1’s hand away from her, Staff 1 “playfully” pushed\nResident A on her back. Staff 1 admitted to the Home Supervisor that she shouldn’t\nhave played like that with Resident A.\n4",
    "Documents\nOn 11/12/2020 I received and reviewed Staff 1’s training records, annual\nevaluations, and written disciplinary action documents. The only written disciplinary\naction provided were as follows:\n Written warning dated 2/11/2019 for an incident on 1/13/2019 during which Staff\n1 failed to pass medication despite documenting that the medication had been\npassed\n Written warning dated 11/8/2017 regarding overdue training\n Verbal warning dated 5/15/17 for an incident on 3/7/2017 during which Staff A left\na resident unsupervised in a bathroom for 45 minutes.\n Written warning dated 11/2/2015 regarding overdue training.\nOn 11/12/2020 I received and reviewed an Incident Report (IR) written by the Home\nSupervisor on 11/9/2020. The IR documented that on 10/26/2020 Resident A told\nSupervisor 1 that on 10/25/2020, Staff 1 “was rude and provoking towards her while\nshe was in a bad mood, and violated her rights by ‘putting her hands on’ her when\nshe asked her not to touch her.” Resident A told Supervisor 1 that Staff 1 “gave her\na little shove as she was trying to get past her and that she had asked her more than\none time not to play around with her like that.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(a) Any type of corporal punishment inflicted in any\nmanner.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 used inappropriate corporal punishment when she\nresponded to Resident A pushing her shoulder by either hitting\nResident A’s hand and or/pushing her on the back.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe staff of the Antonini program did not follow written policies.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews\nOn 11/13/2020 I interviewed Staff 3 by phone. Staff 3 reported that, as she was\nwalking toward the medication room, Resident A asked her to get her a client’s rights\nform, and Staff 3 stated she would after she passed medication. Staff 3 stated that\nshe forgot to get the form. Staff 3 stated that she did not complete an incident report,\nbut she thinks that Staff 1 did because she was Shift Supervisor that night and the\nShift Supervisor typically completes the forms.\nOn 11/13/2020 I interviewed Residents A and Staff 1. Resident A reported that after\nResident A hit Staff 1’s hand, Staff 1 stated that she should give Resident A a\nconsequence of grounding, but she was not going to because Staff 1 was “playing\ntoo much.” Resident A stated that after Resident A asked to call her mentor, Staff 1\nsaid, “you know what, I am going to ground you” and denied Resident A’s request to\ncall her mentor. Staff 1 confirmed that she did tell Resident A she wasn’t going to\nground her because Staff 1 felt as if she had acted inappropriately causing Resident\nA to hit her. Staff 1 stated that she did implement a grounding later, but it was due to\nResident A refusing bedtime expectations and had nothing to do with a call request.\nOn 11/13/2020 I interviewed the Home Supervisor by phone. The Home Supervisor\nstated that Staff 1’s behavior was unprofessional in her interactions with Resident A\nas well as her statement to Resident A that she wouldn’t be grounded, yet later the\nsame evening implemented a grounding. The Home Supervisor stated that no\nincident report was completed that night or immediately after the incident being\nreported to her.\nDocuments\nOn 11/12/2020 I received and reviewed an Incident Report (IR) written by the Home\nSupervisor on 11/9/2020. The IR documented that on 10/26/2020 Resident A told\nSupervisor 1 about the 10/25/2020 incident.\nOn 11/17/20 I received and reviewed the facility’s policy regarding written incident\nreport requirements as well as client concerns/complaint procedure. The Incident\nReporting policy indicates that an electronically written incident report must be\ncompleted within 24 hours of a client rights and or abuse/neglect allegation.\n6",
    "On 11/17/20 I received and reviewed the facility’s policy entitle Suitable Treatment\nand Freedom of Movement Procedures, which describes inappropriate\nresponses/involvement of staff members, including:\n Display of hostility. Examples may include speaking in any angry manner or a\nway that is “blaming” to the child.\n Aggressive or passive behavior used to have unnecessary control over a\nchild.\n Demeaning a child. Examples may include talking down to or ridiculing,\nteasing, mocking, or taunting a child.\n Horseplay, as it is inappropriate for traumatized children. This includes\ntickling.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all\nof the following:\n(C) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for\naddressing residents’ needs, implementation of\ntreatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nANALYSIS: The staff of the Antonini home did not follow written policies by\nfailing to ensure the availability of client complaint forms, not\ncompleting an incident report within the required timeframes, or\nfollowing the staff behavior expectations.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that no change me made to the current license status upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan.\nNovember 19, 2020\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 24, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n8"
