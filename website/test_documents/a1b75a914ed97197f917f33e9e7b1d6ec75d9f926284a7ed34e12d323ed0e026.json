CA\nreported that two foster care positions were vacant, and that staff turnover\ncontinued to be an ongoing challenge for compliance. The CA reported that in\norder to maintain caseload compliance and continuity of service delivery, it is\ncritical to have new hires available to fill vacancies. In situations where staff\ndeparture is unexpected, it takes an extended amount of time to have a new staff\nhired and trained for the vacant positions. The CA reports to improve outcomes for\ntheir youth in care, Oakland County continues to partner with another private\nagency to pilot the Kinship Connection program. The CA reported the Family\nEngagement Specialists are responsible for relative search efforts at the onset of\nthe case for each child entering care. He said this has assisted staff in identifying\nrelatives for placement and establishing family supports. The CA reported this\ninitiative created an open door to economic concrete supports by imbedding\nFamily Resource Specialists within child welfare work units in Oakland County.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThree staff were interviewed via phone, and they reported their immediate\nsupervisors and coworkers are very supportive. The staff interviewed reported\nthey would not change anything about the agency at this time, they enjoy their\nteams, the agency training and the overall environment.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has the space and equipment needed to perform job requirements.\nThe files are stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.",
