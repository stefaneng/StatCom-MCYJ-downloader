TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Technical assistance was not requested or required.",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Review agency policy as it relates to closed adoption files to ensure the files\nare disseminated to central records within the policy required timeframes.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The one\nCAP submitted by the agency was in response to the 1/5/2024 interim licensing\ninspection report. The CAP was approved 2/6/2024 and addressed twelve (4 rule\n& 8 policy) citations. The CAP was successful in four of the areas addressed\nthrough the CAP as evidenced by those areas not being found in violation this\nyear. Of the remaining eight areas addressed in that CAP, two were not reviewed\nthis year as they were policy violations and five were repeated this year, requiring\nadditional assessment and corrective action planning. In addition, four violations\nwere established this year that were not found in the last inspection; however, one\nof those four was addressed through a 1/13/2023 CAP following the 12/15/2022\nrenewal licensing inspection report. It should be noted that four of the violations\nestablished this year are rule subsection violations that were also cited last year;\nhowever, those subsections were combined into one violation last year giving the\nappearance of an increase in violations this year.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment indicated Quality Improvement activities\nwere implemented throughout the year resulting in improvements in required visits\nand initial medical/dental appointments. The Chief Administrator identified\nallocation changes resulting in a loss of staffing as well as numerous staff on\nmedical leave as a barrier to compliance. She indicated caseloads have increased\nwhich has resulted in less time providing social work to families. The previous\nyear's corrective action plan has had some positive impact related to\nmedical/dental appointments, supervisor involvement in tracking timeliness, and\ninitiatives impacting key performance indicators. There have also been negative\nimpacts from the CAP including overwhelming email reminders, calendar invites,\nand micromanagement.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A",
    "Staff Interviews\nStaff members interviewed reported a positive work environment with a lot of\nsupport from co-workers and management. The change in allocations as well as\nstaff member medical leave has increased caseloads; however, staff interviewed\nreported being in compliance with caseload size and finding their caseloads\nmanageable with the assistance of co-workers and supervisors. Staff indicated the\nprevious CAP implementation such as reminders and spreadsheets have helped\nkeep them on track with requirements and timeframes. No concerns were noted\nby any staff other than one who stated an increase in providing data for BSC\ntracking purposes can be time consuming.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office appears to have adequate space and equipment to provide for\nthe delivery of foster care, foster home certification, and independent living\nservices. Paper files and physical CHRI are stored securely as required,\npreventing unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: Smoke detectors needed in basement and outside of youth's bedroom.\nCaregiver needs lockbox for medications.\nResolution: Medication lock box and 2 smoke detectors provided to caregiver\n12/4/2024. Photo evidence of medications in lockbox and installed smoke detectors\nprovided 12/6/24.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 2, 2025\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 6, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
