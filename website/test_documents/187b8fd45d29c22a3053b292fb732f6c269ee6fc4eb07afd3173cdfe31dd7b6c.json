She reported Father looked at Youth\n2",
    "A’s cell phone and saw him messaging Supervisor 1.\nAdministrator reported Father was not clear exactly what the\nmessages were stating, but they were sexual in nature. She\nreported Youth A was placed at the facility from November 2020\nuntil May 2021. Administrator reported Supervisor 1 was the\ncampus-wide supervisor at that time. She reported Supervisor 1\nhad a positive relationship with Youth A, and there were no noted\nconcerns during the time Youth A was placed there. Administrator\nreported Father was unaware of when the relationship started and\ndid not believe anything happened at the facility, but noted that is\nhow Youth A met Supervisor 1. She reported Father stated\nSupervisor 1 had driven Youth A back to his home, and\nSupervisor 1 appeared to be under the influence. Administrator\nreported Father confirmed this drive occurred when Youth A was\ndischarged, and Supervisor 1 was not working at the facility. She\nreported Supervisor 1 has not worked at the facility since May\n2024. Administrator reported there was no concern with\nSupervisor 1 having inappropriate relationships with any youth at\nthe facility, including Youth A.

Father\nreported after Youth A was discharged from the facility, he had\nFather bring him up to visit with the staff. He reported during that\nvisit, Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 were present. Father reported\nduring that interaction, it was asked if Supervisor 1 and Staff 1\ncould be mentors to Youth A when he is in his care. He reported\nhe saw no concerns about this, as these two people were\nsupporting Youth A when he was placed at the facility. Father\nreported Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 had approval from an\nadministrator from the facility to be a mentor to Youth A when he\nwas returned home. He reported he could not remember who the\nadministrator was that gave the approval, but did note it was a\nmale and stated he was present when the official approval was\ngiven. Father reported Youth A had seen Staff 1 a handful of times\nwhen he was returned to Father’s home, and then the relationship\nstopped. He reported Youth A stated the relationship stopped\nbecause Staff 1 was busy with his own family. Father reported\nSupervisor 1 had more visits with Youth A than Staff 1. He\nreported there were concerns brought to light that during these\nvisits, Supervisor 1 may have driven Youth A while under the\ninfluence of substances. Father reported he also heard a rumor of\nSupervisor 1 having a video of Youth A running into the woods\nnaked but never found any evidence of that. He clarified that both\nincidents happened after Youth A was discharged from the facility.\nFather reported when he found the text messages on Youth A’s\nphone between Youth A and Supervisor 1, he felt these were\nsexually inappropriate and made him have concerns about the\nrelationship between Supervisor 1 and Youth A.
