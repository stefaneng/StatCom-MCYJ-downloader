    "• (3) An independent living home, staffed and operated by\nthe child placing agency, must be clean, safe, and\nappropriate to the needs of the youth it serves.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Numerous youths have sanitation concerns regarding the home.\nThe water being used is contaminated and has a black like\nsubstance coming out prior to water coming out. There are also\nwater pressure issues in which the pressure is low, or the water\ncompletely stops. There are issues with the heating and air\nconditioning.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nYouth A was interviewed in person on 1/6/2025 at Corcoran\nHouse, the Independent Living (IL) home where she is living and\nreported concerns with the water home. She stated, there are\nyouths in the home who don’t shower because the water has\ncaused them to have yeast infections and rashes, her skin has\nbroken out from the water, the water makes the sinks, tubs, and\nshowers rusty, and the water pressure and temperature are\ninconsistent. She reported there is a water filter in the kitchen the\nyouths can use for drinking water; however, there are no filters in\nthe bathrooms. She has complained about the water to the\nProgram Manager and other staff of the home and was told filters\nwere being installed on all of the shower heads, but that has not\nhappened. Youth A stated she has video footage of black water\ncoming from a tub faucet and water barely coming out of a shower\nhead.\nYouth A reported having concerns with bugs in the home in the\npast, but there are currently no bugs in the home. She stated\nthere were a couple weeks when there were stink bugs, lady\nbugs, and spiders in the home as well as frogs in the basement.\nShe does not know if the home was treated for bugs/frogs, but\nthey are no longer a concern.\nYouth A reported concerns with the temperature throughout the\nbedrooms in the home not being consistent. She stated some\nyouths’ rooms are too cold, but her room is too hot, so she sleeps\nwith a fan propped in her open window.\nYouth B was interviewed in person on 1/6/2025 at Corcoran\nHouse, the Independent Living (IL) home where she is living and\nreported concerns with the water. She stated she has sensitive\nskin due to having psoriasis and has gone to the hospital for\n2",
    "painful skin irritations after showering. Staff at the hospital\nrecommended she obtain a free home water test from Home\nDepot, which she did. The test showed the “hardness was off”\nwhich was exacerbating her psoriasis. She reported she had been\ngetting a lot of dry spots on her body, mostly on her legs, but it\nhas improved. She stated she has previously lived in a home with\nhard water, but it wasn’t like the water in Corcoran House. She\nstated the staff say there is a water softener and that all of the\nshowers have filters, but Youth B doesn’t believe that to be true.\nYouth B’s only concern with bugs in the home was a lot of gnats\nthat she hasn’t seen since a “certain resident” moved out of the\nhome.\nYouth B reported her bedroom has wide windows, so it tends to\nget cold in her room. She stated a heavy curtain over her window\nwould help the windows as they need better insulation.\nYouth C was interviewed in person on 1/6/2025 at Corcoran\nHouse, the Independent Living (IL) home where she is living and\nreported having concerns with the water. She stated the water can\nbe hot one day then cold the next or barely coming out of the\nfaucet. She also stated; black stuff has come out of the shower\nheads, some of the youths get rashes from the water, and she\ndeveloped a rash when she first moved into the home, but she\nhas eczema and has cream to use for her skin condition.\nYouth C reported not having concerns with bugs in the home or\nthe temperature of her bedroom.\nYouth C reported the faucet in her bathroom sink is loose and\nmoves.\nYouth D was briefly interviewed in person on 1/6/2025 at\nCorcoran House, the Independent Living (IL) home where she is\nliving after she stepped out of her bedroom and asked if the visit\nwas about the water. She reported the water pressure and\ntemperature are not consistent and the water is rusty, at times.\nILP Caseworker was interviewed in person on 1/6/2025 at\nCorcoran House and reported some of the youths in the home\nhave complained the water dries out their skin. She stated the\nhome has well water that is tested every other week and she\nbelieves there is a water filter and water softener installed. She\nstated she doesn’t think there are filters on showers.\n3",
    "ILP Caseworker did not have concerns with bugs in the home and\nwas not aware of any youths having these concerns.\nILP Caseworker stated one youth switched rooms because she\nstated her room was cold and wanted a warmer room, but she\nwas unaware of any other concerns with bedroom temperature.\nILP Caseworker was not told about Youth C’s sink faucet.\nProgram Manager was interviewed by phone on 1/9/2025 and\nreported the home has well water that is treated and tested once a\nmonth. She stated she is not used to hard water and feels that\nmost of the youths in the home aren’t either. When a faucet is first\nturned on in the home there might be a strong iron smell. She\nreported there is a water softener in the home and there were\nfilters on all of the shower heads in the past, but they currently\naren’t installed. She added she can look into getting filters\ninstalled on the shower heads. Program Manager reported they\ntalked about the water concerns during the last house meeting.\nShe stated maintenance has come out to the home multiple times\nfor the water pressure concerns, but she can have them look at it\nagain.\nProgram Manager stated the home is in the country, so bugs do\nappear, but they have not had any infestations. She reported the\nhome in treated for insects monthly during summer.\nProgram Manager reported there was one bedroom in the home\nthat had cool air instead of warm blowing out of the vent, so the\nyouth in that room was moved to a different room and\nmaintenance was notified. She stated there is difficulty regulating\nthe temperature in the home because some of the youths like to\nkeep their bedroom windows open.\nDirector of Maintenance was interviewed by phone on 1/16/2025\nand reported the home has a well and testing is performed\nquarterly. The home’s primary water filter is changed every 6\nweeks. He reported the home’s water softener is maintained by an\noutside company who provides the maintenance and filters, and\nthe water softener has a display which indicates that it is\nfunctioning properly. He stated a water test was completed\n11/14/2024 then another approximately a week ago due to the\nconcern reported by the youths. He stated the test came back with\nno concerns for the water. He called the testing company and\ndescribed the concerns the youths were reporting with the water\nand was told it sounded as if there might be a mold issue which\n4",
    "would have to be tested by a different company. He called a\ncompany who came out and tested for mold. He reported trace\namounts of mold were found in the water and the testing company\nstated the mold was likely coming from stagnant water\nsomewhere in the water system. Director of Maintenance called\nthe Genesee Health Department and was told to contact a\nprofessional well driller for assistance. A professional well driller\nwent to the home yesterday, 1/15/2025 and found the home’s\nexpansion tank had failed and was filled with stagnant water which\nwas likely being drawn into the homes water lines. He stated the\nwell driller is returning to the home, on 1/17/2025 to replace the\nexpansion tank and gauges.\nDirector of Maintenance reported the only issue with that home is\nbox elder bugs appearing in the home as there is a box elder tree\non the property. He stated the home has contracted services for\ntreatment of insects, including box elder bugs, on a monthly basis.\nDirector of Maintenance reported the bedrooms at the back of the\nhome are connected to the furnace and the bedrooms upstairs are\nconnected to the boiler system, so the temperature amongst the\nbedrooms might vary and it’s difficult to balance the temperature\nso each room is the same temperature. He reported they address\nany temperature concerns through their work order system\nwhenever they come up.\nDirector of Maintenance reported he was not aware of the loose\nbathroom sink faucet but will have someone go out tomorrow to\nlook at it.\nVIDEO REVIEW\n• 1/6/2025 – Reviewed video on Youth A’s phone of water\ntrickling out of the shower head when turned on.\n• 1/6/2025 – Reviewed video on Youth A’s phone of what\nappeared to be dark gray water coming out of a tub faucet.\nTOUR OBSERVATION\nA tour of Corcoran House was completed 1/6/2025.
