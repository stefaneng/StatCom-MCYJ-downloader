    "II. ALLEGATION(S)\nViolation\nEstablished?\nOn 5/08/21, staff member initiated a restraint which deviated from Yes\nCPI. Staff member was making inappropriate comments during\nthe restraint. After restraint was de-escalated, staff member\ncontinued to verbally respond to youth in an antagonistic way.\nStaff members 8 and Staff 2 entered through the front door, the\nrestraint was in process; they stepped in between Youth A and\nStaff 7, as the incident began to deescalate gradually. The hold\nwas said to have lasted five seconds or so. Staff 7 made\ncomments prior to initiating a restraint, including, \"I killed people in\nthe army for 10 years.\" After the restraint concluded, Staff 7 did\nkeep space, as Youth A continued to pursue her with what\nseemed like intent to assault, although she did also continue to\nrespond verbally in a way that could be interpreted as\nantagonistic. It is unknown if Youth A had marks or bruises from\nthe incident. Youth A did have some bruising on his arm, however\nhe stated those were from last week. There were cameras in the\narea the incident occurred. Staff 7 will be moved to a different\nhouse so that she is not in contact with Youth A.

Youth A began\ntargeting Staff 3; however, did not swing at him. Staff 3 continued\nantagonizing Youth A to fight him. Youth A eventually did start\nbecoming more physical with Staff 3; however, turned it towards\nStaff 4. At this point, Staff 3 jumped in front of Youth A and began\npushing him away from the situation and lightly shoved Youth A to\nthe ground. This led to Youth A yelling and screaming and\nbecoming more physically aggressive with staff.\nOn 05/08/2021, staff member, Staff 2, threw Youth B on the No\nground during a restraint.

    "On 05/08/2021, Staff 7 initiated a restraint, which deviated from CPI -- this restraint\nwas documented in a report filed with D.A. Blodgett St. John's. Staff 7 guided Youth\nA's arms with her hands on his wrists down to his side and pushing him up on the\nwall to create some space.\nStaff members 8 and Staff 2 entered through the front door, the restraint was in\nprocess; they stepped in between Youth A and Staff 7, as the incident began to\ndeescalate gradually. The hold was said to have lasted five seconds or so. Staff 7\nmade comments prior to initiating a restraint, including, \"I killed people in the army\nfor 10 years.\" After the restraint concluded, Staff 7 did keep space, as Youth A\ncontinued to pursue her with what seemed like intent to assault, although she did\nalso continue to respond verbally in a way that could be interpreted as antagonistic.\nIt is unknown if Youth A had marks or bruises from the incident. Youth A did have\nsome bruising on his arm, however he stated those were from last week. There\nwere cameras in the area the incident occurred. Staff 7 will be moved to a different\nhouse so that she is not in contact with Youth A. Staff 7 has not had any previous\nincidents related to this type of behavior in the past.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Administrator 1 by phone on 5/10/21. She reported being aware of\nthe allegations and that she would provide the following information: video recording,\nface sheets, treatment plans, safety plans, policy/procedures, and staff’s phone\nnumbers. She also reported that the two staff involved in the allegations have been\nsuspended until this investigation is completed. She reported that the facility has\nrequested a 30-day removal of Youth A because of his level of aggressive behaviors\nand mental illness. She also reported that the facility is not able to meet the needs of\nYouth A and that he needs a higher more secure setting for appropriate treatment.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone on 5/10/21. He reported that Staff 7 and Staff 3\nwere in the house when Youth B stuck his head out of the open door and said, “you\nbitch”. He also reported that he ran inside the house and observed Staff 7 placing\nYouth A in an inappropriate hold. He reported that Staff 7 was facing Youth A and\nhad a hold of his wrists while his back was against the wall. He reported that she\nshould have used a “child-controlled hold or high-level hold” rather than what she\nwas using and given Youth A more space. He also reported that he and Staff 8 got\nbetween Staff 7 and Youth A and initiated an appropriate hold while starting to\ndeescalate him. He reported that Staff 3 was trying to verbally deescalate Youth A\nwhile also dealing with Youth B at the same time. He reported a belief that Staff 7\nwas not trying to harm Youth A but just trying to stop him from punching her. He\ndenied hearing what Staff 7 and Youth A were saying but remembers that they were\ngoing back and forth about something. He reported that she was not being helpful\nwith the de-escalation of Youth A and later in the shift, he was told by Youth A that\nStaff 7 said something about “killing people while being in the army for ten years”.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "I interviewed Youth A in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by video\nconference on 5/10/21. He reported not remembering being restrained by a female\nstaff. He reported being restrained by a male staff who left bruising on his arms but\nwas unable to identify when this occurred and by whom.\nI interviewed Staff 7 in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by video\nconference on 5/12/21. She reported that the incident began when Youth A failed to\nfollow directions and Youth B told Youth A to hit her. She also reported that he\nstarted hitting her in the chest and he blocked her from leaving the area. She\nreported grabbing his wrists and pinning them to his side as a way of keeping him\nfrom hitting her. She also reported that once Staff 2 came into the house, she\nreleased her hold and Youth A hit her again. She reported that she did not use the\ncorrect technique to engage in a restraint, but she also reported that Staff 3 should\nhave restrained Youth A using the correct technique from behind. She reported\nbeing trained to do a restraint from behind and that she was never taught how to\ndeal with a youth who was in her face. She reported telling Youth A that he would\nnot kill people after hearing Youth A say to his parent that he was going to kill\npeople. She also reported that she did say she has killed people while in the army\nShe reported making this statement as a way of “helping Resident A understand that\nhe would not follow through with harming others”. She reported that she has worked\nat the facility for the past month, and this was her first restraint.\nI interviewed Staff 8 by phone on 5/12/21. He reports coming into the house and\nobserving Staff 7 engaged with Youth A as described in the allegations. He gave a\nsimilar report to Staff 2 with Staff 7 holding Youth A’s wrists. He reported, “it looked\nlike she was trying to stop him from hitting her” and also reported that her actions\nwere not a “CPI hold”. He reported not understanding why the other staff in the\nhome did not assist her.\nI interviewed Staff 3 in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by Video\nconference on 5/13/21. He reported being present during the allegations and that\nhe observed Staff 7 not using the appropriate de-escalation techniques with Youth\nA. He also reported that Staff 7 appeared “aggressive” with both Youth A and Youth\nB. He was asked about his position during the incident, and he reported that he was\ntrying to get Youth B out of the home. He also reported that he wanted to get Youth\nB out of the home so Youth A would calm down and stop fighting Staff 7. He\nreported “I didn’t see anything, but I know she was not using a proper restraint”.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the document titled “Critical Incident/Adverse Event Report Form dated\n5/8/21 @ 8:00 am and authored by Staff 2. The following was documented.\nYouth A was restrained -- see RIR -- in the vicinity of 8 a.m. in Hunting House\nmilieu. The restraint, while brief, deviated from CPI and was stopped on sight.\nIt was later reported by both Youth A and Youth B that some of the\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "commentary from staff directed towards students may have been\ninappropriate and potentially antagonistic.\nI reviewed the video recording of the incident between Staff 7 and Youth A. The\nvideo shows Staff 7 and Youth A face to face (almost touching) with Staff 7’s hands\non Youth A’s wrists. Staff 7 walks forward while Youth A is walking backwards\ntowards a wall. The video ends when they are just off camera view.\nI reviewed the document tilted, “Restrictive Intervention Report” that was authored\nby Staff 7. It is noted in this document that the intervention took place because\nYouth A was a “Harm to others” and there was “imminent risk of serious physical\nharm”. The following was noted on the document.\nStaff 7 was followed by Youth A as he continued to verbally assault her,\nmaking various threats; he encroached into her personal space and poke a\nfinger into her chest repeatedly, feigning punches with his other hand. Youth\nA was encouraged to keep his space and to keep his hands to himself –\n“Youth A: I’m not trying to hit you; please don’t hit me.”\nAs Staff 7 tried to head for the door to remove self from area, Youth A\ncontinued to follow Staff 7 around the house until, using his fists as weapons,\nhe hit her in the breast; a restraint was initiated once he did in an effort to\nkeep all parties safe.\nStaff 7, after being assaulted, went to block Youth A’s fists, which he still had\nclenched and cocked back, guiding his right wrist down to his side with her\nleft hand and guiding his left hand down to his side with her right; it was a\nreactive deviation from CPI. She held lightly at his wrists and the restraint\nlasted no more than five or 10-seconds. This is when Staff 2 and Staff 8 re-\nentered the house from outside, assessing the situation and stepping in\nbetween Staff 7 and Youth A to create some space between them. The\nrestraint was released at this time.\nI reviewed the personnel file of Staff 7. She was hired on 4/5/21 and completed all of\nthe required training for her orientation. This training included de-escalation and\nbehavior management techniques. There is no documentation of any disciplinary\naction.\nI reviewed Youth A’s current “Residential Updated Service Plan” dated 4/28/21. This\ndocument outlines the treatment services provided to Youth A and the goals to\naddress the presenting problems. His progress and issues presented while at the\nfacility is also documented.\nI reviewed the facility’s CPI restraint techniques. This document addresses several\ntypes of physical intervention but stresses de-escalation as the primary technique.\nThere is no description of the type of hold that Staff 7 used as viewed on the video\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "recording and verbal descriptions from Staff 7 and other staff. There are several\ndescriptions of the appropriate way to handle a youth when face to face with the\nyouth. It is stated in this document, “avoid individual intervention when possible. Use\na team approach”.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nRule 1 Prohibition of Prone Restraint; Procedures Involving Other\nRestraints in Child Caring Institutions\n(2) Resident restraint must be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child's behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident's treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews, written documentation,\nand video recording support the allegations of Staff 7 not\nconducting the restraint in a safe manner as an approved\ntechnique was not utilized. There is also evidence that Staff 3\ndid not support Staff 7 (hired one month ago) in her efforts to\ndeal with Youth A and he failed to engage in a “team approach”\nas recommended in the CPI manual.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nYouth A was escalated and attempting to fight staff throughout the night. Youth A\nwent up to Staff 3 and threatened to fight him. Staff 3 told Youth A to \"go for it\";\ninsisting Youth A would choose not to do so.\nYouth A continued threatening Staff 3; however, did not follow through on fighting\nhim.

Youth A eventually did start becoming more\nphysical with Staff 3; however, turned it towards Staff 4. At this point, Staff 3 jumped\nin front of Youth A and began pushing him away from the situation and lightly\nshoved Youth A to the ground. This led to Youth A yelling and screaming and\nbecoming more physically aggressive with staff.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "INVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Staff 1 by phone on 5/10/21. He reported working at the facility as a\n“Youth Developmental Specialist” for the past two years. He reported the two-youth\nwanted to fight staff and again ran outside. He reported going outside and hearing\nYouth A screaming. He also reported observing Staff 3 talking with Youth A and\noverhearing Staff 3 say “if you’re going to go let’s go”. He reported Youth B was\n“sticking his head out of the door of the house and yelling for Youth A to hit Staff 3.\nHe also reported that Staff 3 will make this type of statement with Youth B but that\nStaff 3 “has a very positive relationship with Youth B and Youth B will responded in a\npositive way”. He reported that at this time, Staff 4 came into the situation and Youth\nA began to move aggressively towards Staff 4. He reported that Youth A “swung on\nStaff 4 and Staff 3 told him that he is not going to do that”. He reported that Staff 3\nthen “softly pushed Youth A away from Staff 4 and Youth A fell to the ground”. He\nalso reported Staff 3 was not aggressive towards Youth A but “Staff 3 should have\nremoved himself from the situation”. He reported that after telling Staff 3 to leave, he\nleft the area.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone on 5/10/21. He reported getting to work around\n10:30 to 11:00 pm when he observed Youth A and Youth B leave the house. He also\nreported hearing what sounded like the youth assaulting staff outside so he went to\nthe location of the sound. He reported there were several staff present and all were\ntrying to deescalate the two youth. He gave a similar report as other staff about the\ninteraction between Staff 3 and Youth A and ended the interview when he reported\nthat Staff 3 put his arm out to get more space which caused Youth A to fall to the\nground. He also reported not observing any aggression by Staff 3.\nI interviewed Youth A in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by video\nconference on 5/10/21. He reported not remembering the allegations or falling to\nthe ground.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone on 5/11/21. He reported being present during\nthe incident between Staff 3 and Youth A. He also reported that he was in the\nbasement of one of the homes when he heard noise from outside and went to\ninvestigate. He reported observing Youth A and Youth B engaged in aggressive\nbehaviors towards Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4. He also reported the youth\nwere trying to get to staff and attempted to punch staff. He reported Youth A\nattempted to grab Staff 4 when Staff 3 began to make a barrier to keep him away.\nHe reported turning around at that time because of the actions of Youth B and when\nhe turned back around, Youth A was on the ground “screaming that Staff 3 had\npushed him down. He reported that the use of a staff’s arms as a barrier is\nsomething they are taught and is appropriate as long as they don’t push with their\narms.\nI interviewed Staff 6 by phone on 5/11/21. He reported not being present during\nany of the incidents identified in the allegations. He also reported being on campus\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "during the second allegations but that he was in the house and didn’t go outside at\nthat time.\nI interviewed Staff 5 by phone on 5/11/21. He reported being in the house doing\npaperwork when he heard noise outside and rushed out. He gave the same report\nas other staff about the aggression by Youth A and Youth B. He also reported the\nsame information about Staff 3’s reaction with the exception that “Staff 3 shoved\nYouth A to the ground after Youth A attempted to hit Staff 4. He reported Staff 3\nstood over Youth A and said “you need to calm down” before being told to leave the\narea by the other staff. Staff 5 reported that Staff 3 was “very heated”.\nI interviewed Staff 4 in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by phone on\n5/13/21. She reported coming to the campus during her off time in an effort to be\n“supportive of the other staff”. She reported observing Staff 3 and Staff 1 outside\nwith Youth A and Youth B, so she stopped to be a support. She reported that Staff 1\nleft the area so she “stepped between Youth A and Staff 3 because Youth A was\ncursing and striking at Staff 3”. She also reported that after stepping between them,\nYouth A shoved her and tried to choke her. She reported that Staff 3 then stepped\nbetween them and “didn’t do anything extra”. She denied that Staff 3 put his hand\nout and reported that “he kept his hand down at his side the whole time”.\nI interviewed Staff 3 in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by video\nconference on 5/13/21. He reported “blocking” a hit from Youth A on Staff 3. He\nalso reported, “Youth A was going to hit Staff 4 and I stepped in the way and he fell\nbackwards”. He reported that Youth A fell because they bumped into each other. He\nreported that his arms and hands were at his sides throughout the incident and that\nhe placed his whole body between Staff 4 and Youth A when he was attempting to\nblock him from hitting her.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the document titled “Behavior Management Policy”. The following is noted\nin this document, “diversion and de-escalation techniques are the approaches staff\nwill respond with. Physical restraint will only be employed as a last resort”.\nI reviewed Youth A’s safety plan. This document outlines staff’s response to different\nbehaviors that Youth A may present. Some of the responses that staff are to check\nin with Youth A to determine his current level of emotional functioning and offer him\nthe chance to engage in activities that help calm him. It is also documented that\ntriggers that can cause dysregulation for Youth A.\nI reviewed the document titled “Critical Incident/Adverse Event Report Form dated\n5/8/21 @ 11:30 pm and authored by Staff 1. The following was documented.\nYouth A was being assaultive with Staff 3 and was attempting to fight Staff 3.\nStaff 4 intervened and attempted to create some space. Youth A stated that\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",

Once de-escalated, Youth\nA allowed this writer to check on his thumb. This writer did not notice any\nswelling or bruising and noticed a full range of motion with some pain. Ice and\npain meds were offered, but Youth A declined. When this writer checked in on\nYouth A later and processed through the night, Youth A stated his thumb was\nfine.\nI reviewed the personnel file of Staff 3. Documentation indicates that he received all\nof the required training including Trauma-Informed Care, De-escalating Hostile\nClients, and Best Practices: Behavior Support, and Intervention. There is no\ndocumentation that he received any disciplinary action.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies and\nprocedures that describe the institution’s behavior management\nsystem. The policies and procedures shall be reviewed annually\nand updated as needed. These shall be available to all\nresidents, their families, and referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as Staff 3 did not use an\nappropriate method when attempting to deal with Youth A’s\nbehavior. His intervention resulted in Youth A falling to the\nground which is not a positive strategy in assisting Youth A to\nmake positive choices in his actions.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2021C0223020 dated 04/20/21, CAP approved 05/05/21\nSIR 2021C0112018 dated 03/25/21, CAP approved 04/14/21\nSIR 2021C0112015 dated 02/05/21, CAP approved 02/23/21\nSIR 2020C0103045 dated 12/28/20, CAP approved 02/03/21\nSIR 2020C0103043 dated 10/28/20, CAP approved 11/16/20\nSIR 2020C0223042 dated 08/10/20, CAP approved 08/25/20\nALLEGATION 3:\nOn 05/08/2021, staff member, Staff 2, threw Youth B on the ground during a restraint.\nYouth B did not receive any marks or bruises.

    "from Youth B. Supervisor 1 also reported being informed that Staff 4 was not present\nduring the incident. He reported telling Staff 4 to compete a report to centralized intake\nabout the situation she reported to him but reported that she left without doing so.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone on 5/11/21. He reported remembering the\nrestraint but not being present at the time. He also reported talking to Youth B about the\nrestraint and having Youth B show him a bruise on his back yesterday which Youth B\ntold him occurred during the restraint. He reported being told by Staff 2 that during the\nrestraint he had to drop to his knee to reposition himself so he didn’t fall and that this\nmay have caused the bruise. He reported Staff 2 asked Youth B if he was hurt or\nneeded to see the nurse following the restraint and having Youth B deny any pain or\ninjury. He denied being informed of the allegations by either Staff 3 or Staff 4.\nI interviewed Youth B in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by video\nconference on 5/12/21. He reported he remembered the restraint by Staff 2 and gave\nthe following information. “He kneed my back and I have a bunch of marks. He didn’t do\nit right and needs to be trained.” Youth B also reported that Staff 2 sat him on the\nground when he kneed him in the back. He reported that no one asked if he was alright\nafter the restraint.\nI interviewed Staff 8 by phone on 5/12/21. He reported being present during the\nrestraint of Youth B by Staff 2. He also reported that Youth B told Youth A to attack Staff\n2 after “Staff 2 told him that it was not cool to attack Staff 7”. He reported working with\nYouth A to calm him down while Staff 2 began to attempt to deescalate Youth B. He\nreported “Staff 2 used an appropriate child control hold” with Youth B after Youth B\nrefused to deescalate. He reported hearing Youth B say he couldn’t breathe so Staff 2\nchanged his position and asked Youth B if he was alright. He also reported Youth B\nattempted to go to the ground but Staff 2 “got him into a more comfortable position”. He\nreported at the end of the restraint, Staff 2 did ask Youth B if he had any injures or\nissues and Youth B did not complain of any bruising or soreness. He also reported in\nthe past, Youth B would complain about any issues of soreness or pain.\nI interviewed Staff 4 in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by phone on\n5/13/21. She reported being informed about the allegations by Staff 3 and then telling\nSupervisor 1 about the allegations. When asked about not making a report, she\nreported believing that she didn’t have enough information and only secondhand\ninformation. She also reported believing that Staff 3 had processed the situation with\nStaff 2.

    "I interviewed Staff 2 in collaboration with the DHHS specialist by video\nconference on 5/13/21. He reported checking with Youth B following the restraint and\nYouth B didn’t report any issues of pain or injury. He also reported being told by\nSupervisor 2 that he observed bruising on Youth B’s back later in the day and Youth B\nreported the bruising to Supervisor 2 and his parents. He reported that this was the third\nrestraint of Youth B that day. He gave the same report that was written in the incident\nand restraint reports. He reported having to reposition himself because Youth B was\n“yelling rape”. He also reported that Youth B dropped his weight causing him to “go\ndown and I kept my knee in the same position”. He reported that he used a CPI\napproved child hold during the restraint and once he released Youth B, Youth B began\nto “attack again”. He reported that if bruising did occur during this restraint, “it might\nhave been the result of Youth B dropping his weight and hitting my knee”.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone on 5/12/21. He confirmed what he had reported\nearlier. He reported that Youth B told him about the bruise on his back and that it\noccurred when he dropped his weight during the restraint. He also reported Youth B\ndidn’t believe Staff 2 had done anything wrong during the restraint or abused him. He\nreported not making a report because he did not suspect any abuse by Staff 2. He\nended by reporting that Youth B said he was not slammed to the ground.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed Youth B’s safety plan. This document outlines staff’s response to different\nbehaviors that Youth B may present. Some of the responses that staff are to check in\nwith Youth B to determine his current level of emotional functioning and offer him the\nchance to engage in activities that help calm him. It is also documented that triggers\nthat can cause dysregulation for Youth B.\nI reviewed Youth B’s current “Residential Updated Service Plan” dated 3/30/21. This\ndocument outlines the treatment services provided to Youth B and the goals to address\nthe presenting problems. It also documented his progress and issues presented while at\nthe facility.\nI reviewed the incident report involving the restraint of Youth B by Staff 2. The restraint\noccurred on 5/8/21 at 9:52 am and is identified by the incident number 116790177. This\ndocument states the following.\nYouth B shouted RAPE repeatedly after initial engagement and in response, this\nwriter was sure to position their left knee between he and Youth B, turning to the\nside in the process, to be sure there was no incidental and inappropriate touch.\nYouth B claimed that he couldn’t breathe well, and staff repositioned to a more\nupright position, releasing some of the tension on his arms in the process to\nrelease some of the potential restriction across his chest.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",

Staff 4 had recently been\nmade aware that Staff 3 was suspended and was questioning why Staff 2 wasn't\nas well. Supervisor 1 told her that he didn't have any information on it and that it\nwasn't a topic he was able to speak with her about.

Supervisor 1 asked if this had been reported and the\nresponse given was that Staff 3 told Supervisor 2.

    "I interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone on 5/12/21. He confirmed what he had\nreported earlier. He reported that Youth B told him about the bruise on his back and\nthat it occurred when he dropped his weight during the restraint. He also reported\nYouth B didn’t believe Staff 2 had done anything wrong during the restraint or\nabused him. He reported not making a report because he did not suspect any abuse\nby Staff 2. He ended by reporting that Youth B said he was not slammed to the\nground.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the facility’s policy on reporting suspected abuse. This document states\nthe following.\nAny staff person who has reason to suspect child abuse or neglect must\nreport the suspicion to Children’s Protective Services (CPS) immediately via\ntelephone (855-444-3911) or by submitting the report online\n(newmibridges.michigan.gov and then select, “Partnerships.”)\nI reviewed the personnel file of Staff 4.
