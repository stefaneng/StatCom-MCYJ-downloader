    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Discharge plan\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4166\nSection (1) When a resident is discharged from institutional care, all of the\nDescription following information shall be documented in the case record\nwithin 14 days after discharge:\n(e) A statement that the discharge plan recommendations,\nincluding medical and dental follow up that is needed, have been\nreviewed with the resident and with the parent and with the\nresponsible case manager.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was released to another agency with a potential medical\ncondition not reported to transportation.\nInvestigation\nOn 6/26/24, I interviewed Complainant 1 and Complainant 2.\nBoth reported they received Youth A for placement from Macomb\nCounty Juvenile Center. Both reported they were not given\nmedical information pertaining to Youth A needing a follow up TB\ntesting.\nComplainant 2 reported Youth A was initially placed in their\nfacility. Youth A’s judge ordered him to go to a secure placement\nfor a two-week time frame. Complainant 2 reported Youth A was\nnot discharged from their facility, only placed on hold. After the\ntwo-week court ordered time frame, Complainant 2 reported they\npicked up Youth A on 6/17/24 from Macomb County Juvenile\nCenter. Later in the day, they received a phone call from the\nMacomb County agency reporting Youth A will need to have a TB\nX-Ray completed at the hospital. Complainant 2 reported their\nstaff had potentially been exposed to TB due to Youth A riding in\nthe vehicle with them. Complainant 2 reported no one provided\ntheir staff with verbal or written documentation that stated Youth A\nmay be positive for TB.\nAdministrator 1 reported Youth A was placed with them on\n6/3/24 and was discharged on 6/17/24. Administrator 1 reported\nYouth A was picked up on 6/17/24 and discharge paperwork was\ncompleted on 6/17/24. Administrator 1 reported they complete TB\ntests for all new intakes and if there is a positive result, they are\nsent for X-rays. There was a delay in sending him to the hospital,\nbut Administrator 1 was unsure of what that delay was.\n2",
    "Administrator 1 reported she did not feel that there was a rule that\nwas broken.\nNurse 1 reported Youth A had a TB test on 6/12/24 and the\nresults were read on 6/15/24. Youth A tested positive for TB, so a\nchest X-Ray was ordered for 6/17/24. Nurse 1 reported Youth A\nwas picked up from placement before his X-ray. Nurse 1 reported\nshe contacted the agency that picked up Youth A and told them\nthey would need to take him to the appointment. Nurse 1 reported\nYouth A was released at 12:20pm and she made the phone call at\n1:00-1:15pm.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• TB Record: Dated 6/12/24 TB was planted, 6/15/24 TB\nread as positive, 6/17/24 date for chest X-ray.\n• Discharge Release Summary: The discharge was\ncompleted on 6/17/24.\no Under the heading “summary of services provided\nincluding medical and dental”, the document\nreported, “routine medical services, dental services.”\no Under the assessment of residents needs that\nremain to be met: “N/A”\n• Resident Medical Assessment dated 6/15/24: “Medical\nisolation X 3 days and/or until cleared by medical.”\nAnalysis The agency is found to be non-compliant.\n• Complainant 1 and Complainant 2 reported they did not\nreceive information pertaining to Youth A’s medical\nconcerns when they picked him up from the facility.\n• The Discharge Summary completed by Macomb County\nJuvenile Center, does not indicate that this information was\npassed on. The form is intended to recap the conversation\nthat was had between the placement and the receiving\nparties. In this case, there were no medical concerns noted\nor discussed.\n• Nurse 1 did contact the new placement within one hour of\ndischarge, with the important medical details that were not\npassed on.\nConclusion Violation Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n8/16/2024\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
