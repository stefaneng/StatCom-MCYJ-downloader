INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Compliance with the child protection law\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12214\nSection • (1) An agency shall comply with the child protection law,\nDescription 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Three foster youth were placed in a foster home from May 2022-\nSeptember 2023. During this period, the children went to 177\nmedical appointments, diagnosed with several ailments, and\nendured medical procedures and surgeries. One of the foster\nparents has extensive mental health history and there is a concern\nfor Munchausen by Proxy. Since the youth have moved, the\nyouth's medical problems have not persisted or improved. Second\nopinions were sought from new doctors and these medical\nprofessionals report no concerns for the children. The foster care\ncase managers were aware of these concerns but failed to report\nthem given all of the information at hand.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on July 16, 2024.\nThere was no additional information to add.\nFoster Parent 1 & Foster Parent 2 were interviewed face to\nface by DHHS Worker on June 21, 2024. Their attorney was\npresent via telephone and advised them not to answer any\nquestions.\nPrivate Agency Foster Care Chief Administrator (PAFC CA)\nwas interviewed via telephone on June 28, 2024. She stated\nshe first became aware of Foster Parent 1 & 2 when her staff\nalerted her there was an issue. Youth A, B and C were placed in\nFoster Parent 1 & 2’s home through a borrowed bed placement\nand the agency was not aware of the extent of the mental health\nhistory since none of the inpatient mental health records were\n2",
    "included in the initial home study evaluation that is received and\nreviewed prior to a borrowed bed placement.\nStaff informed her Youth A, B and C needed to be moved and\nthere were lengthy discussions due to how long the kids had been\nin the foster parents’ home. PAFC CA stated it was during the\nadoption process the concerns escalated due to receipt of multiple\ninpatient mental health records for Foster Parent 1 and the large\nnumber of medical appointments the children were subjected to,\nsome of which the agency was not aware of.\nPAFC CA stated the agency discussed the concerns of\nMunchausen Proxy internally, regarding Foster Parent 1 & 2. She\nclarified they were concerned that it was Munchausen by Proxy,\nbut they did not have a doctor that would support this concern.\nShe clarified none of the medical providers involved with Youth A,\nYouth B and Youth C, reported any concern but this concern\nwasn’t discussed with the doctor’s either. There wasn’t anything to\ncall into Centralized Intake because they didn’t have a doctor\nstating Youth A, B or C were taken to medical appointments or\nprocedures that weren’t needed.\nShe stated they were torn because the kids had been in the\nplacement for a long time and there were many discussions\nregarding disrupting the placement and adoption. The agency\ncontacted Michigan Children’s Institute (MCI) with their concerns.\nMCI supported the agency and their concerns and agreed it was\nin the best interest of the children to remove them from Foster\nParent 1 & 2.\nPAFC Program Manager (PAFC PM) was interviewed via\ntelephone on July 2, 2024. She stated she was first made aware\nof concerns regarding Youth A, B and C in the foster parent’s\nplacement after termination of parental rights took place in March\n2023 and the adoption worker started assessing the home. This\nincluded reviewing the file and documents and conducting visits.\nThe PAFC Adoption Worker didn’t feel the 3130A that was\ncompleted on Foster Parent 1 & 2 was adequate, specifically\nregarding the mental health history.\nThere were internal discussions regarding the concerns. The\nconsensus was they would address the concerns with the\nlicensing agency and go from there. However, the meetings did\nnot go well. The licensing agency was defensive of Foster Parent\n1 and 2 and did not seem to want to open a special evaluation to\n3",
    "investigate or address their concerns. She stated prior to one of\nthe meetings, they were asked by the licensing agency for their\nconcerns in writing and provided a written response about 15\nminutes before the meeting started. During the meeting there was\nlimited dialogue, and the licensing agency made them feel as\nthough the concerns were blown out of proportion.\nPAFC PM stated they were concerned about the excessive\nnumber of medical appointments and questioned the situation.\nThere was additional information that their office obtained after the\nchildren were moved in September 2023. Specifically new medical\nproviders that were not in agreement with previously reported\nconcerns. They are currently placed with relatives and current\nmedical providers are stating there are a number of\nservices/appointments the children do not need. They had strong\nsuspicions, but they did not have any medical professionals that\nstated the children were going to too many appointments.\nPAFC Adoption Worker (PAFC AW) was interviewed via video\nconference on July 3, 2024. She is assigned to the case for\nYouth A, B and C. She began assessing Foster Parent 1 & 2 for\nthe adoption process in March 2023. She indicated they signed\nthe intent to adopt not long after she was assigned the case, and\nshe began her assessment not long after. She stated Foster\nParents 1 & 2 are licensed through another agency and had been\na borrowed bed placement for their office. She requested their\nhome study and had heard there had been some concerns with\nthe number of appointments Foster Parents 1 & 2 took the\nchildren to.\nUpon being assigned to the case PAFC FC Supervisor 2 had\ninformed her Youth A, B & C go to a lot of appointments and there\nwere issues with Foster Parent 1 & 2 notifying the agency after the\nfact and sometimes not informing them at all. She stated PAFC\nFC Supervisor 2 had indicated there had also been some\ndiscussions with Foster Parents 1 & 2 regarding the need for\nsome of the appointments and provided an example of problem\nsolving when the children have a cold, such as do the children\nneed to be seen by a doctor or could a visit to the doctor wait a\nday or two to see if it clears up. PAFC AW obtained access to the\nchildren’s patient portals at Cherry Health. Foster Parent 1 & 2\nhad requested access and were told by the PAFC not to request\naccess but went and obtained access anyway. Once PAFC AW\nhad access to the patient portals is when the agency realized how\noften the children were going to the doctor; especially Youth C\n4",
    "who had over 200 appointments since being placed with Foster\nParent 1 & 2 for less than one year.\nIn reviewing the initial home study, she was surprised to see\nFoster Parent 1’s extensive mental health history. She stated it\nwas her understanding the PAFC agency knew of some of the\nhistory but not how extensive it was. The initial home study\nmentions Foster Parent 1 being hospitalized approximately 20\ntimes in the past due to mental health. She reviewed Foster\nParent 1 & 2’s MISACWIS provider record and didn’t see any of\nthe records and there was no other mention in the home study.\nIncluded in the home study were a couple health evaluations that\ncovered the past 2 years but did not go back further. It also\nmentioned her having a history of auditory hallucinations.\nPAFC AW stated she did not believe Youth A, B and C were at\nimminent risk while placed in Foster Parent 1 & 2’s home but there\nwas a more constant underlying concern. She stated at the time,\nshe did not believe Youth A, B and C were being abused but this\nconcern was elevated during Foster Parent 1’s most recent\nhospitalization in August 2023. After Youth A, B and C were\nplaced elsewhere, the PAFC agency was no longer concerned\nregarding the number of medical appointments Foster Parent 1 &\n2 took them to.\nPAFC AW stated there were internal discussions regarding\nconcerns about the number of medical appointments and there\nwere questions about whether it was Munchausen. She stated\nWhile speaking to medical offices to confirm the number of\nappointments the children attended, PAFC FC Supervisor 1\ninquired if there were concerns regarding how many appointments\nthe children attended. She stated Cherry Health and Spectrum\nuse different systems so they most likely were not able to see\nappointments the children had attended with the other provider\nand did not report any concerns. Once the children were moved to\nanother placement and it was determined by the new medical\nproviders Youth A, B and C did not have all of the medical needs\nFoster Parent 1 & 2 indicated they had, the agency realized the\nextent of the concerns.\nPAFC Foster Care Supervisor 1 (PAFC FC Supervisor 1) was\ninterviewed via telephone on July 3, 2024. She stated she was\nassigned as the foster care supervisor from 9/13/2021 until\n5/20/2022 and then PAFC FC Supervisor 2 was the primary foster\ncare supervisor while she was on maternity leave. She came back\n5",
    "from maternity leave and was reassigned as the foster care\nsupervisor on 3/4/2023. After termination of parental rights had\noccurred, her assignment ended on 9/5/2023. When she was\nreassigned to the case in March 2024 a transfer meeting was held\nthat included adoption staff. The purpose of the meeting was to\nprovide up to date case information. PAFC FC Supervisor 2\nmentioned Foster Parent 1 & 2 had been difficult to work with. At\nthe beginning of April 2024 FCW brought up some concerns\nduring supervision. Youth B, who was 3 years old at the time, was\ntaken to a psychiatrist at Cherry Health on 4/7/2023 and the\npsychiatrist wanted to prescribe him with caffeine. She sought\ninput from the agency’s behavioral health team and asked FCW to\ntry and get more information regarding why Youth B was referred\nto a psychiatrist and how many appointments he has had since\nthis was the first they had heard of him going to a psychiatrist. The\nagency obtained the records from the psychiatrist and learned this\nwas the first time Youth B had met with a psychiatrist and the\npsychiatrist had diagnosed him with Reactive Attachment Disorder\n(RAD) in addition to prescribing him caffeine. PAFC FC\nSupervisor 1 stated this raised red flags and the agency requested\na second opinion, but Cherry Health did not agree. A follow up\nappointment was scheduled that included PAFC FCW and PAFC\nAW along with Foster Parent 1 & 2. The appointment did not go\nwell. Caseworkers were questioned by the psychiatrist as well as\nFoster Parents 1 & 2 regarding why they were there, why they\nwere questioning the diagnosis of RAD and why they were not\nwilling to consent to caffeine pills. PAFC FC Supervisor 1 stated\nduring the time from the first appointment with the psychiatrist and\nthe second appointment, Foster Parents 1 & 2 sent multiple text\nmessages to PAFC FCW and PAFC AW indicating the kids were\nsick and needed to be taken to the doctor. She stated this was\noccurring so often that it raised red flags.\nAt that point the agency contacted Cherry Health and inquired\nhow often Foster Parents 1 & 2 were taking Youth A, B and C to\nthe doctor and asked how many appointments have occurred. The\nagency was provided the information on 4/26/2023 when PAFC\nAW was granted access to the children’s patient portal through\nCherry Health. PAFC AW provided all the appointments she\ngathered in the patient portal on 5/4/2023. PAFC FC Supervisor 1\nwent through and verified the appointments took place because\nsometimes if a call is placed to a doctor with a question, it can be\nlisted as an appointment. Once the appointments were verified a\nsupport specialist requested all the documentation from the\nmedical providers. PAFC FC Supervisor 1 clarified there had been\nsituations where one or more of the youth were taken to the doctor\n6",
    "for an ear infection and Foster Parents 1 & 2 wanted to take them\nback the following day without allowing time for the medication to\nwork. Based on the concerns, the agency scheduled a Family\nTeam Meeting (FTM) in May 2023 with Foster Parents 1 & 2,\nhealth care liaison, licensing worker and supervisor from DHHS\nlicensing, to discuss the concerns regarding the number of\nmedical appointments the children were taken to. A verbal safety\nplan was developed where Foster Parent 1 & 2 were told to notify\nthe agency in a timely manner of any appointments for the\nchildren so someone from the agency could attend. From that\npoint on Foster Parent 1 & 2 notified the agency of each\nappointment they were scheduling.\nAdditional concerns came up after PAFC AW received the initial\nhome study and other documents she received as part of her\nadoption assessment. The agency scheduled a meeting with\nDHHS licensing on 5/4/2023 and with the Department of Child\nWelfare Licensing (DCWL) on 5/12/2023 to review concerns with\nFoster Parent 1. Complex case reviews included the foster care\nworker, foster care supervisor, any internal service providers, and\nclinical team (Family Preservation Team and Behavioral Health\nTeam) from the PAFC agency. Complex case reviews were held\non a biweekly basis. The participants from the complex case\nreviews were concerned with Munchausen but did not know what\navenue to take since no one at the PAFC agency was qualified to\nmake that diagnosis. This was the point when they requested\nmeetings with the DHHS licensing team and DCWL.\nPAFC FC Supervisor 1 stated there were over 130 appointments\nthat Foster Parents 1 & 2 did not notify the agency of. She stated\nDHHS licensing questioned why they didn’t bring the concerns to\ntheir attention sooner. She stated once they had information and\ndocumentation to back up their concerns, they brought it to the\nattention of DHHS licensing. PAFC FC Supervisor 1 stated she\nhad a couple of meetings with PAFC FC Supervisor 2 and\ninquired if she had any concerns while she was on the case. She\nstated there were concerns regarding the number of appointments\nas well as Foster Parents 1 & 2 frequently asking to switch\nservices. Foster Parents 1 & 2 did not want any services through\nPAFC.\nWhen PAFC FC Supervisor 1 was assigned, she was informed\nduring the case transfer meeting that Foster Parents 1 & 2 had\nbeen difficult to work with. They were stressed and overwhelmed,\ndid not like the direction the PAFC agency was going with the\ncase, the length of time it took for parental rights to be terminated\n7",
    "and Biological Mother still had to provide consent prior to\ntermination. After March 2023 things seemed to improve slightly\nbut it was still a struggle regarding communication and obtaining\nrequested information and documentation. Foster Parents 1 & 2\nreported Youth A, B and C had all sorts of medical issues and\nbehavioral concerns, specifically Youth A, B and C were not\nattaching appropriately. In addition, Foster Parents 1 & 2 stated\nYouth A, B and C should not be placed together and specifically\nhad stated Youth B needed to be placed elsewhere if the agency\ndecided not to separate all of them. PAFC FC Supervisor 1, PAFC\nFCW, and the adoption team started to dig a little deeper and\nrealized Foster Parents 1 & 2 were not actively working with the\nservice providers in the home. The service providers working with\nthem reported Youth A, B and C are bonded and they did not\nshare the same concerns regarding behaviors and attachment.\nYouth A, B and C’s daycare provider did not have any of the\nconcerns that Foster Parents 1 & 2 were reporting. It raised the\nlevel of concern because none of the service providers were\nseeing any of the behaviors or concerns Foster Parents 1 & 2\nwere reporting.\nPAFC FC Supervisor 1 stated Foster Parents 1 & 2 made it\ndifficult to conduct monthly home visits to verify wellbeing. She\nstated this was the most difficult piece and the agency tried to\naccommodate them as much as possible. For example, enhanced\nfoster care (EFC) was doing weekly home visits so the PAFC\nFCW would ask to do a visit at the same time and Foster Parents\n1 & 2 would respond by saying that is too many people in the\nhome. The attachment therapist was required to meet weekly but\ndue to Foster Parents 1 & 2 constantly rescheduling she was only\nable to conduct biweekly visits or sometimes had to do virtual\nvisits despite Youth A, B and C needing the service. PAFC FC\nSupervisor 1 again stated although the agency had concerns, they\nwere not concerned with imminent risk and they were not qualified\nto make a determination regarding Munchausen by Proxy.\nPAFC Foster Care Program Manager (PAFC FC PM) was\ninterviewed via telephone on July 3, 2024. She could not recall\nwhen concerns were initially brought to her attention regarding\nYouth A, B and C while placed with Foster Parents 1 & 2.\nConcerns started to arise regarding the number of medical\nappointments Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C were going to. The\nagency was not aware of the majority of the appointments at the\ntime they were occurring. Once they were able to gather some\ninformation and documentation after parental rights were\n8",
    "terminated and adoption became involved, they became\nconcerned. At the same time, they did not have any medical\nprofessionals who had expressed those concerns. The agency\nhad concerns regarding the number of appointments. After the\nchildren were removed the agency was able to obtain a clearer\npicture of the amount and type of appointments they had been\ntaken too. They were taken to different medical professionals who\ndid not feel some of the medical needs reported by Foster Parents\n1 & 2 and previous medical professionals were accurate. PAFC\nFC PM stated she did not have her notes in front of her to provide\nmore detailed examples, but she recalled one youth having a RAD\ndiagnosis and that concern had never been previously reported\nand another instance of one youth being seen by an allergy\nspecialist and had not been diagnosed with any allergy.\nPAFC FC PM stated Foster Care Review Board became involved\nafter the children were in September 2023 due to Foster Parent 1\n& 2 filing an appeal. She stated the agency contacted MCI to\ndiscuss concerns and their desire to move the children but could\nnot recall when those interactions started. Foster Care Review\nBoard and MCI both agreed it was in the children’s best interests\nto move to a different placement.\nPAFC FC PM stated the agency had concerns but did not feel the\nconcerns rose to the level of Children’s Protective Services (CPS)\ninvolvement. Youth A, B and C were attending appointments and\nnone of the providers reported they were going too often or being\nseen for things they shouldn’t be. The idea was to reassess after\nYouth A, B and C were moved and able to be seen by other\nproviders to see if the previous medical concerns were still\npresent.\nPAFC Foster Care Worker (PAFC FCW) was interviewed via\nTeams on July 10, 2024. She stated she was assigned to the\ncase from March 2023 until approximately March or April 2024.\nShe stated she was given an update on the case when she was\ninitially assigned and was told about concerns regarding Foster\nParent 1 & 2 doing things they were asked by the agency not to\ndo. One example she provided was Foster Parent 1 & 2 were told\nnot to take Youth B to a psychiatrist and did anyway. The agency\nreceived a coordination form for Youth B’s monthly early childhood\nattachment therapy at the agency and it was noted that he had\nattended a psychiatric appointment. At that point, PAFC FCW and\nPAFC AW called the office and found they had another\nappointment scheduled for him. She stated this was the first red\nflag that there were appointments the agency wasn’t aware of.\n9",
    "They were concerned why Youth B was seeing a child psychiatrist\nas he was only 3 years old. Foster Parents 1 & 2 were not in\nagreement with the agency’s concern and informed the agency\nthey could attend the follow up appointment and expressed their\nconcerns. PAFC FCW and PAFC AW attended the appointment\non 4/7/2023 and expressed their concerns with the child\npsychiatrist. The psychiatrist was diagnosing Youth A with\nReactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) and wanted to prescribe a\ncaffeine pill and Benadryl. PAFC FCW stated the child psychiatrist\nwas not in agreement with the agency’s concerns. Due to COVID\nrestrictions, only one foster parent was allowed back so Foster\nParent 1 was present. PAFC FCW stated Foster Parent 1 was\npresenting as though she was going to have an anxiety or panic\nattack due to the agency not agreeing with the recommendations.\nThe child psychiatrist wrote in her report the foster care agency\nwasn’t complying with medical direction.\nThere were no concerns regarding the number of appointments\nYouth A, B and C were going to until the agency gained access to\nMy Chart and saw all of the appointments they went to. Not long\nafter the appointment with the psychiatrist the agency had a\ndiscussion regarding efforts to locate medical records to see\nwhere and how many appointments Youth A, B and C had been\nto, since it was clear the agency was not notified of all of them or\nthe majority of them. Some of the reasons Youth A, B and C were\nseen were due to behavioral and medical concerns reported by\nFoster Parents 1 & 2. The agency had enhanced foster care and\nan early childhood attachment therapist going to the home. Foster\nParents 1 & 2 reported Youth A was throwing up every time she\nwas eating. The service providers in the home had not reported\nthose concerns. Relative visits were also occurring, and the\nagency asked if they observed any concerns, and they were not\nseeing the same things. There was a large inconsistency with\nwhat was being reported and what had been observed. The\nagency began to question what observations Foster Parents 1 & 2\nwere reporting to medical providers.\nPAFC FCW stated she became concerned regarding Foster\nParent 1’s mental health due to her behavior at the psychiatric\nappointment. The initial disagreement with Youth B’s treatment\nplan and not agreeing with a RAD diagnosis caused Foster Parent\n1 to present some physical behaviors in response, such as\nshaking, heavy breathing, rocking back and forth and putting her\nhands in her hair. PAFC FCW and PAFC AW discussed the\nconcerns and the need to obtain Foster Parent 1’s mental health\nrecords to gain a better understanding of the scope of her issues.\n10",
    "PAFC FCW clarified the meeting was professional and there was\nno yelling, but there were different opinions, and she was visibly\nupset.\nPAFC FCW stated there was never a service provider or medical\nprovider that reported concerns regarding the number of\nappointments the children were attending. She and PAFC AW\ninquired with the receptionist at Cherry Health about obtaining\nrecords for all the appointments. She stated they have attended\nmany appointments and would need to make a request to obtain\nverifications. She stated it was somewhat conflicting because she\nand PAFC AW felt strongly about their concerns but none of the\nother providers agreed other than the providers at their agency.\nThe agency began having conversations regarding moving Youth\nA, B and C between May-August 2023. They recently considered\nbest interests and what moving Youth A, B and C to other\nplacements could look like. They addressed some of the concerns\nin the treatment plan and informed Foster Parents 1 & 2 if this\ndoesn’t work, Youth A, B and C would be moved. She clarified the\nplan included notifying the agency prior to initiating any medical\nappointments for the children and ensuring Foster Parent 1 was\nparticipating in services to address her mental health. She stated\nthe Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) was supportive of the agency.\nFoster Parents 1 & 2 agreed to the treatment plan but wouldn’t\nfollow through. They didn’t have proof Foster Parent 1’s mental\nhealth was being addressed and there continued to be\nappointments the agency was not notified of. After Youth A, B and\nC were moved, they were seen by new medical providers, as the\nagency wanted a fresh perspective. After Youth A, B and C were\nassessed the relative’s presented questions from PAFC FCW\nregarding specific medical diagnoses and concerns that were\npreviously reported by Foster Parent 1 & 2. The questions were\nasked after the assessment to gain an accurate and unbiased\nassessment. The appointment for each youth noted no concerns.\nPAFC Foster Care Supervisor 2 (PAFC FC Supervisor 2) was\ninterviewed via telephone on July 17, 2024. She stated she\nbecame assigned as the supervisor approximately 30 days prior to\nthe children moving to Foster Parent 1 & 2’s home, which\noccurred on 5/5/2022. She initially had concerns regarding Foster\nParent 1 & 2 when she became the supervisor due to Foster\nParents 1 & 2’s excessive contact. She stated every day there\nwere 10-20 emails, text messages or voicemails from Foster\nParents 1 & 2 to PAFC FCW asking questions regarding topics\nthat were not important, but Foster Parents 1 & 2 were very\n11",
    "anxious about. For example, children’s legal father wasn’t involved\nbut Foster Parents 1 & 2 had heard at some point through non-\nchild welfare sources that legal father may be in Michigan. Foster\nParents 1 & 2 made up their minds that he was dangerous and\nwould find out where they lived and take Youth A, B and C. They\nwould also ask questions regarding topics/issues they were not\nprivy to know. For example, they wanted to know where biological\nmother lived. They would then report concerns regarding Youth A,\nB and C or ask questions regarding them. The questions didn’t\nmake sense in the moment, but the agency wasn’t concerned with\nthe questions, just the amount of daily contact. The agency asked\nFoster Parents 1 & 2 to put together a weekly email with\nquestions, concerns or comments and the worker would respond\non Monday morning. She stated Foster Parents 1 & 2 didn’t follow\nthe guidelines, so she took over the communication with them\nbecause they were overbearing.\nIn spring of 2023 PAFC FC Supervisor 2 began having concerns\nregarding the number of appointments the children were\nattending. She stated Foster Parents 1 & 2 would take Youth A, B\nand C to a med center or the ER prior to notifying the agency and\nit would be due to common cold symptoms. She stated she was\naware Foster Parents 1 & 2 had a higher level of anxiety and felt\nthis was probably the reason for taking those steps, as well as\nbeing first time foster parents. She stated she asked for\ndocumentation for the appointments and Foster Parents 1 & 2\nwould not provide them. She stated she had conversations with\nthem indicating they should not be taking Youth A, B and C to the\nmed center or ER every time they cough or sneeze. She stated\nthey were welcome to call their primary care physician.\nPAFC FC Supervisor 2 stated Foster Parents 1 & 2 indicated\nYouth A, B and C have asthma and she responded by informing\nthem that a diagnosis for this does not exist. PAFC FC Supervisor\n2 stated they may have it but there is not a current diagnosis. She\nstated she informed Foster Parents 1 & 2 that she needed to be\nnotified prior to taking the children to a medical appointment and\nwhen an appointment occurred, she wanted paperwork. PAFC FC\nSupervisor 2 stated this did not happen. She stated they were\nvery pushy to have the children obtain COVID shots and biological\nmother did not agree and would not consent. Foster Parents 1 & 2\nattempted to bully the GAL to have the shots court ordered and it\nwas brought up to the agency several times. Foster Parents 1 & 2\nwanted to address the issue with Youth A, B and C’s biological\nmother. Biological Mother did consent, but the behavior was\nconcerning.\n12",
    "When she did her last home visit with them, she requested all the\nmedical documentation for Youth A, B and C. She stated she had\nasked multiple times in the past. She stated Foster Parents 1 & 2\nstated they have all the documents in a drawer in their home, but\nthey were not organized so they would not provide them. She\nstated they provided a different excuse each time for why they\nwouldn’t provide the medical documentation. On one occasion\nthey stated, “you have access to the chart”, or “we told you about\nthis” or “we sent this to you”. She stated she received some\ninformation and documentation, but it didn’t match the amount\nYouth A, B and C were going. She stated during the time she was\ndirectly involved it wasn’t an egregious number of appointments.\nbut as time went on the suspicions grew regarding the number of\nappointments the Youth A, B and C were taken to and Foster\nParent 1 & 2 not providing medical documentation for all the\nappointments the children attended. In addition, Foster Parents 1\n& 2 said no to providing requested documentation from the\nmedical appointments to her during a home visit, the agency\nagreed they needed to start investigating. She stated she\nreviewed Foster Parents 1 & 2 home study which briefly mentions\nthe mental health concerns and all the behaviors of Foster Parent\n1 & 2 she noted made sense.\nShe stated she never had concerns for Youth A, B and C’s\nphysical safety while with Foster Parents 1 & 2. She observed\nFoster Parents 1 & 2 were overly concerned and attentive with\nYouth A, B and C. She stated she was concerned with how their\nbehavior would affect Youth A, B and C long-term, particularly\nYouth B. She stated they would often paint a picture that he was a\nvery misbehaved child who has numerous needs. She stated she\ndid not observe any behaviors that were above what a typical 3-\nyear child would display. She stated during meetings with service\nproviders or GAL and FTM’s they would indicate he was so\nmisbehaved, and they can’t get him to listen, and they aren’t sure\nwhat to do. Some of the behaviors they discussed were witnessed\nby PAFC FC Supervisor 2 and she didn’t think it was above and\nbeyond what a typical 3-year-old would display.\nDHHS Licensing Supervisor (DHS LS) was interviewed via\nTeams on July 25, 2024. He stated Foster Parent 1 and Foster\nParent 2 have been licensed through his office since April 2022\nand until last fall had placement of a sibling group of 3 through a\nborrowed bed placement with a PAFC agency. He stated there\nwere concerns regarding Foster Parents 1 & 2 calling PAFC\n13",
    "agency too much and once the case moved to adoption there\nwere additional concerns reported.\nHe stated his office opened two special investigations on Foster\nParent 1 and Foster Parent 2 based on concerns reported. The\nfirst one, initiated on 6/20/2023 was regarding, in part, concerns\nabout the number of medical appointments Youth A, Youth B and\nYouth C were attending and also Foster Parent 1’s mental health.\nThe second special investigation was initiated on 10/13/2023 due\nto concerns Foster Parent 1 needed to seek inpatient\nhospitalization to address mental health concerns.\nDHS LS stated PAFC didn’t express any concerns when his office\nreached out to the agency to include input for their 6-month\nrenewal. He stated they contacted PAFC for the most recent\nevaluation, but he doesn’t believe they responded. DHS LS stated\nPAFC did not report any concerns related to the safety and\nwellbeing of Youth A, Youth B and Youth C.\nDHHS Licensing Worker 1 (DHS LW1) was interviewed via\nTeams on July 26, 2024. She stated she was assigned as the\nlicensing worker for the special investigations. The first one was\nregarding concerns that Foster Parent 1’s mental health wasn’t\nthoroughly reported and assessed during the initial evaluation.\nThe second one was regarding a mental health episode Foster\nParent 1 had and if she was fit to continue to be a licensed foster\nparent. Foster Parent 1 & 2 were found to be in compliance with\nlicensing rules for both special evaluations.\nDHS LW1 stated during her involvement there was never anything\nexpressed from the PAFC that there were safety concerns with\nYouth A, B and C. In reading the Foster Care Review Board\nfindings, the PAFC acknowledged Youth A, B and C were safe in\nFoster Parents 1 & 2 home and they had no concerns for their\nsafety and well-being in the home.\nDHHS Licensing Worker 2 (DHHS LW2) was interviewed via\nTeams on July 30, 2024. She stated she is the assigned\nlicensing worker for Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2. She\ncompleted the initial home assessment when they were licensed\nin 2022 and completed any subsequent reevaluations.\nShe stated Foster Parent 1 was forthcoming from the beginning\nregarding her mental health history and has been consistent with\nthe information throughout their working relationship. During the\ninitial licensing process, she reported she had been hospitalized\n14",
    "due to her mental health approximately 20 times. She provided\ninformation regarding her diagnosis, medications she was taking,\nas well as family history.\nShe stated the PAFC reported concerns in May 2023 regarding\nthe number of medical appointments Foster Parents 1 & 2 took\nYouth A, B and C to. DHHS asked the PAFC for follow up\nbecause this was not a concern reported by any of Youth A, B and\nC’s providers and they never received a completed list for all\nmedical, behavioral and/or mental health appointments. A list of\nmedical appointments were provided to Foster Parents 1 & 2 and\nthey reviewed and provided any documentation or communication\nthey had with the PAFC regarding appointments listed. Some of\nthe appointments listed were actually triage calls. Special\ninvestigations were initiated upon receiving concerns regarding\nFoster Parents 1 & 2. She stated the PAFC never reported any\nsafety concerns of Youth A, B and C with Foster Parents 1 & 2.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A, B & C MISACWIS case file: Family Team\nMeeting (FTM) conducted on 5/4/2023. Family/Youth\nStrengths & Needs: The team discussed getting a second\nopinion for Youth B. There were concerns that the child\npsychiatrist diagnosed Youth B after two appointments.\nTherefore, it was recommended Youth B see a new PCP to\nreceive a new referral to a child psychiatrist to ensure\nYouth B is receiving proper services that coordinate with\nhis diagnoses. It was discussed that the family continue\nattachment therapy at DA Blodgett St. John's. The family\nexpressed wanting to switch service providers for\nattachment therapy for Youth B. It was recommended they\ncontinue to work with the DAB attachment therapist as the\ntime of the request they had only participated in two\nsessions with her”.\nSafety Planning: “The team discussed process of\nscheduling medical appointments as the agency was\nmissing documented appointments. The team discussed\nthat all appointments must be noted and documented. The\nfoster parents will contact the agency prior to scheduling\nappointments. The foster parents will inform the team of\nappointments that did or did not occur. The foster parents\nwill contact the triage line at Cherry Health prior to\nscheduling an appointment to see if it's necessary for the\nchildren to be seen in person or if the illness can be\nmanaged at home”.\n15",
    "5/30/2023 Parent Agency Treatment Plan (PATP): “Youth\nC’s medical needs will continue to be monitored closely as\nhe has attended many doctor’s appointments. The agency\nwill monitor this closely as it is imperative Youth C is\nreceiving appropriate medical care. It is also important that\nthis be monitored as the agency does not want Youth C to\ngarner anxiety or fear regarding the doctor’s or illnesses.\nThe agency has asked that the foster parents inform the\nagency of all medical appointments and provide all\ndocumentation and recommendations. The agency has\nalso requested that the foster parents inform the agency of\nmedical needs prior to scheduling appointments so that the\nagency can ensure it is necessary to meet Youth C’s\nneeds. The agency has also requested this since there\nhave been concerns of multiple appointments that occurred\nthat the agency was not aware of. This area will continue to\nbe monitored and updated”.\nAnnotation on signature line of PATP states: “home visits\noccurred on 6/12/2023 and 7/21/2023, Foster Parent 1 & 2\nrefused to sign this”.\n8/23/2023 Updated Service Plan (USP). Reasonable\nefforts: Due to an appropriate relative being located that is\ninterested in taking all three children, foster parents were\nnotified of the agency’s decision to move the children on\n8/1/2023. Foster parents appealed the move and a FCRB\nhearing occurred on 8/11/2023. FCRB agreed with the\nagency’s decision to move the children.\n• 5/12/2023 email between PAFC and DHS licensing agency.\nWe have concerns surrounding the following areas:\n• Mental Health for Foster Parent 1.\n• Refusal to attend in person trainings.\n• Continuing to push back or disregard directives\ngiven by the agency.\n• Number of medical appointments for the children\n• Scheduling medical appointments with providers\nthe foster home has been informed they should\nnot be scheduling with until further assessments\nare completed (i.e. Email on 01/12/23 from Brandi\nregarding Dr. King) & (i.e. Email on 01/09/23 from\nBrandi to Ottawa CMH on IMH services)\n• Finding out appointments/service providers after\nappointments take place instead of prior.\n• Communication on relaying information to agency\npersonnel\n16",
    "• 5/22/2023 email from FC Program Manager to DCWL\nConsultant. We have a case that we would like to discuss\nto get recommendations and to process on how best we\nshould move forward. This is regarding a sibling group of 3\nthat is placed in a borrowed bed home through DHHS. We\nhave concerns with the licensed foster home that has\nplacement. We tried to process some of these concerns\nwhen we met with DHHS licensor and supervisor on\n5/12/23 but they do not agree with our concerns. We would\nlike to see when you would be available to discuss the\ndynamics of this case. There have been several mental\nhealth concerns that we have regarding the foster parents.\nIn addition, we have noticed concerns and discrepancies\nwith what the foster parents report are the children’s needs.\nThere are a lot more dynamics to this case that PAFC FC\nSupervisor 1 can provide if you need more information.\n• 8/11/2023 email from FCRB to agency & FP. “On August\n11, 2023, per your request as foster parents, the Foster\nCare Review Board (FCRB) conducted a foster parent\nappeal meeting of Court Case #21-51354-NA, concerning\nYouth A, Youth B and Youth C.\nBased on the appeal meeting, the Board agreed with the\nagency that the proposed placement change IS in the\nchildren’s best interests. Therefore, the MCI\nSuperintendent does not need to make a decision\nregarding the children’s placement.\nThe FCRB Appeal Report will be emailed to the MCI\nSuperintendent and all Interested parties on Wednesday,\nAugust 16, 2023.”\n• MCI Notification & Case Conference Request Form.\nNotification date 8/30/2023. “On 8/9/23, the agency met\nwith MCI regarding moving all three children from their\nlicensed foster home due to concerns with the foster\nparents. The matter went before the Foster Care Review\nBoard on 8/11/23. On 8/16/23, the Board agreed with the\nagency and supported the move.”\nMCI Directive: We already gave direction that the children\nare to be moved. If they have something more they want,\nthey need to be specific. The foster care review board\nupheld the move, so they need to move them.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of related documentation, the PAFC\nexpressed concerns regarding Youth A, B and C while placed with\nFoster Parent 1 & 2. The reported concerns involved the\n17",
    "excessive number of medical appointments Foster Parent 1 & 2\ntook Youth A, B and C to as well as Foster Parent 1’s mental\nhealth, however there is no indication the agency expressed any\nsafety or imminent risk factors that warranted a referral to\nCentralized Intake and/or law enforcement.\nTechnical Assistance\nThe agency was provided technical assistance regarding the need\nto report any suspected abuse or neglect of children to centralized\nintake immediately prior to any internal investigations.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.
