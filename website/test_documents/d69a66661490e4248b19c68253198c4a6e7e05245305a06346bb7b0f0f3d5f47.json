IR states that police arrived at\napproximately 7:30pm.\n- Absent without legal permission (AWOLP) POL-005-022\nstates reasonable efforts must be made to return a youth\nwho has attempted to leave without authorization. Policy\nstates the facility must make proper notifications within 1\nhour and documented accordingly. The Supervisor/Team\nLeader/Therapist will also notify the client’s\nparent(s)/guardian if appropriate, as well as the referral\nworker (if applicable) and police department. All\nnotifications must be completed within one hour and\ndocumented in the incident report accordingly.

According to the facility’s incident report, Youth A’s\nFoster Care Worker was contacted at 6:44 PM and Youth B’s\nFoster Care Worker was contacted at 6:52 PM. Neither of these\nare within an hour of the youth going AWOLP.\nAdditionally, Staff 4 admitted she exited the building without a\nwalkie talkie or working phone. Per the agency ‘s AWOLP policy,\nall staff exiting a building in pursuit of an AWOLP must have a\nworking walkie-talkie or cell phone on their person for proper\ncommunication. There was knowledge Youth A was likely going to\ngo AWOLP as she was on a Truancy Observation Plan, so staff\nshould have been prepared to act and follow the AWOLP policy.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\n• The facility should ensure all staff working in a building they\nare not normally assigned to have access to and\nknowledge of where all required items (i.e. walkie talkie)\nare located.\n• The facility should incorporate truancy observation\ninformation into their AWOLP procedures and AWOLP\ntraining. For example, throughout this video and interviews\nconducted, it was clear the youth were planning to go\nAWOL, but staff were not diligent in recognizing or acting\non those signs (i.e. youth wearing multiple layers of clothing\nincluding coats, Youth A getting her mother’s picture\nbecause she can’t leave anywhere without it, youth\ninsisting on being on one end of the building, etc.).\n6",
