    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows.\nA CAP was approved on 4/18/23 as a result of the 3/14/23 Interim review. The\nCAP addressed six violations regarding employee files, IL Contracts, and IL\ntermination documentation. During the current review eight violations were found,\nincluding three repeat violations regarding employee files. While the agency has\nshown improvement in some areas, a new CAP is required to address the current\nviolations.\nA CAP was approved on 10/5/23 as a result of Special Investigation\nCB810406448. The agency was cited regarding Rule 214, Compliance with child\nprotection law. CAP follow-up was completed in January 2024 and found the\nagency has been following the CAP action steps. CAP follow-up will continue until\nApril 2024.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed. The CA\nreported the agency has struggled this year due to several external factors that\nimpacted the CA and the Supervisor. As this is a small program, the CA and\nSupervisor are the primary resources for the program. When they are out of the\noffice, there is no one available to cover the workload. The CA stated they have\ndone their best to keep up this year, but it has been difficult.\nIn addition, the IL house has also struggled with an increase in crime in the area.\nThe CA cited a 300% crime increase in the community, which has increased the\nneed for law enforcement interactions with some of the IL youth.\nAlso, the agency has been working hard to provide additional services and\ninterventions to youth with increasing mental health needs. The CA indicated that\nsecuring funding for additional services has been challenging.\nDespite these challenges, the agency has adjusted and adapted. They have\nbegun using a new staffing model that seems to work well and provide an extra\nlayer of support for staff and youth. The CA is involved in community projects and\nwork groups at the state level to help strengthen IL services.\nOverall, while the work is difficult, the CA is optimistic about the future.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were found.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nOne staff was interviewed. Staff reported the agency had a challenging year, but\nthings have started to settle down. The program is running smoothly and youth are\nbenefiting from services. There were no concerns identified or suggestions for\nimprovement.",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be housed in a former school building, with other\ncommunity businesses. Their space has adequate storage for confidential\ninformation. Staff have sufficient space to complete job duties, as well as meeting\nspace for client contacts.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNot applicable. This agency is Independent Living only.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 23, 2024\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n1/24/2024\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager"
