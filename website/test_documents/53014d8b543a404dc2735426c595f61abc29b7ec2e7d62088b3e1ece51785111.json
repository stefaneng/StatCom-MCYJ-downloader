Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional ISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract/Policy violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included in\nsection 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements\nexcept for the following:\n1",
    "RFCAN Contractor Responsibilities- Services to be Provided-\n2.10.R Wardrobe/ Personal Possessions\nThe Contractor must assure that each youth has an\nadequate wardrobe as defined by and documented on the\nClothing Inventory Checklist (DHS3377) while in placement\nand upon leaving placement. When the youth is absent or\nat the conclusion of the placement, the Contractor must\nhave a process in place to keep the youth’s wardrobe and\npossessions safe until claimed by the youth or primary\ncaseworker/agency. If the possessions are not claimed\nwithin 90 calendar days, the Contractor may dispose of the\nitems at its discretion.\nThree of three open residential youth files reviewed did not have the required\nClothing Inventory Checklist (DHS 3377). One file did include a checklist that was\nnot fully completed or dated. Two of two closed residential youth files reviewed did\nnot have the required Clothing Inventory Checklist (DHS 3377) upon leaving\nplacement.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n- All documentation of required training completed by employees should be in the\nemployee personal file, for example the shadow shifts for new employees. The\nfacility had this information, but it was not included in the personnel filed provided\nto the consultant at the time of the review.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n- The increased number of restraints were discussed. The restraints have been\nnoted to be less than a minute hold because the youth will drop their body weight\nto the floor. The Chief Administrator noted the facility is working closely with the\nAEGIS institute in how to best support training staff members. The facility is\nmeeting as a team to review all restraints that occur on a weekly basis. The\nfacility is also working with Residential Collaboration and Technical Assistance\nUnit (RCTAU).\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility had fifteen special investigations during this period under review with eight\nresulting in corrective action plans. The non-compliances included behavior\nmanagement, discipline, staff qualifications, and agency polices. The facility’s\n2",
    "corrective action plan compliance is monitored quarterly and have completed all\ncurrent corrective action plans.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nChief Administrator noted over this reporting period COVID-19 has continued to be a\nsignificant factor in the provision of services. Most notably they have seen an\nincrease in resignations and a very challenging hiring environment. The facility has\nincreased their training for new staff and have brought on a new Staff Coach to work\nalongside new staff to help ensure that they have everything they need to be\nsuccessful. The facility continues to work on reducing and eventually eliminating\nrestraints.\nInterviews:\nStaff and youth interviews were conducted during the inspection and no issues or\nconcerns were raised. The youth all reported feeling safe and had positive\nrelationships with staff members. The staff all reported feeling supported by direct\nsupervisors as well as administration. The facility has implemented a new de-\nescalation model, AEGIS and this supports the facility to be more trauma informed.\nThe facility has created “calming room” in the homes for the youth that live there.\nThese are spaces where youth can go when they need help to regulate themselves\nwith sensory items.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on their regular license.\nMarch 10, 2022\n___________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 11, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3"
