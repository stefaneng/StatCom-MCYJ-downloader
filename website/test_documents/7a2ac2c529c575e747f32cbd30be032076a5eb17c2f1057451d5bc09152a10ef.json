It is also important the tools and procedures the programs have in place\n(i.e., quarterly file reviews) are being utilized consistently to ensure success.\n• Ensure Human Resources has all required employee documents, so each\nemployee file is uniform and consistent.\nV. CONSULTATION\n• Supervisors or Managers could conduct random video footage reviews and\nreviews on interval check logs to ensure checks are being conducted for youth at\nintervals not to exceed 15-minutes and that the eyes-on checks are being\ncompleted.",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were 1 substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. Special Investigation 2023C0000203 dated 3/15/2023 found the facility in\nnon-compliance for rule 400.4158(1)(a)(ii) Interventions Standards & Prohibitions\nand Rule 400.4112, Staff Qualifications. A corrective action plan, which included\nadditional training for staff, was approved on 4/10/2023. In addition, the agency\nterminated one staff member and another staff member resigned. The facility’s\ncorrective action plan compliance is monitored quarterly. The agency has been in\ncompliance with meeting the expectations within their corrective action plan.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan not related to maltreatment\nduring this licensing period. The facility’s corrective action plan was a result of their\n2022 interim audit inspection. The violations found during the interim inspection\nincluded a central registry check not being completed within 30 days of hire for a\nnew staff, an employee evaluation not being completed within 180 days for a new\nstaff, a staff member not receiving 16 hours of orientation prior to assuming duties\nof the position, a clothing inventory not being completed for one youth, and a youth\nfile lacking a medical exam within 30 days of admission, The agency's corrective\naction plan was approved on 9/15/22. The agency demonstrated compliance with\nthe corrective action plan as there were no repeat issues during the period of\nreview for this renewal inspection. Although Rule 400.4113(1)(i) is considered a\nrepeat violation, the circumstances surrounding the violation are not the same.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted the tools and processes they put in place because\nof the 2022 interim inspection corrective action plan have been working. CA noted\nthe most difficult situation during the period of review was the discovery of mold in\nthe program and the subsequent transfer of the youth to another licensed CCI. CA\nnoted repairs and construction are ongoing and they anticipate the project will be\ncompleted by the end of October 2023. CA reported there have been no\nunplanned discharges during the period of review. CA reported the agency\nconducts regular team meetings to review policies/procedures, receive specialized\ntraining on a variety of topics, adjust necessary programming and ensure quality\nservice at all levels.",
    "Staff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviews were conducted during the onsite inspection. Staff reported low\nstaffing has created some tension, but overall, they are a great team and feel they\nwork well as a unit. Staff reported their direct supervisors are very supportive, but\nthey do not feel as much support from upper management. Staff noted upper\nmanagement makes a lot of demands, but aren't onsite or talking to staff to learn\nabout their daily work, barriers, etc. Staff would like more transparency from upper\nmanagement related to budgetary concerns, staff wages and lay-offs/staffing\nchanges at the Bethany Christian Services company level. Staff feel the wages\naren't competitive for the work being conducted and feel it's unfair staff who have\nworked for the agency for years are receiving close to or the same wages as\nbrand-new staff. Staff noted this creates resentment as seasoned staff are doing\nmore work and have more responsibilities since they are training new staff.\nDespite these concerns, it is apparent staff love their jobs, love working with the\nyouth, and want to continue to be there to support the youth during their stay at the\nagency.\nYouth interviews were conducted during the onsite inspection. Youth reported the\ntransition from Casa Del Sol's location to Bridgeway's location has been difficult as\nthey do not have as much freedom. They reported they are excited to go back to\nCasa Del Sol's location within the next couple months. The youth feel the staff\ntreat them well and they have no complaints about interactions with staff. The\nyouth who go to temple would like to go more often, but low staffing has not\nallowed them to. They would like to see staffing improve so they are able to go on\nmore outings. Some youth also noted they would like to personally take more trips\nto pick out and purchase food to satisfy their cultural needs.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn onsite inspection at the agency's temporary location at CCI Bridgeway's third\nfloor on 8/25/23 was completed and no concerns were noted. Casa Del Sol has\nbeen temporarily operating out of Bridgeway's location due to a mold issue\ncausing everyone to relocate from Casa Del Sol's location due to repairs and\nconstruction required. It is anticipated the construction and repairs will be finished\nby the end of October 2023. As a result of the construction, a fire inspection and\nan environmental health inspection are unable to be completed at Casa Del Sol's\nlocation prior to the expiration of the license. A variance was approved on 9/8/23\nfor Rules R 400.4101-R 400.4568 and it is expected the inspections will be\ncompleted no later than 11/1/2023.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.",
