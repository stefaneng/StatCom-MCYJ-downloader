    "summary": "A Special Investigation was initiated following an allegation that a youth was sexually assaulted by two other youths in his room at the Lincoln Center facility. The investigation, involving interviews with staff, multiple youths, and the alleged victim, found that while an altercation involving horseplay and an attempt to pull down the youth's shorts did occur, staff intervened within seconds and the evidence was insufficient to substantiate the claims of sexual assault or a lack of supervision. Given the immediate staff intervention and the investigative conclusion, primary culpability for a serious assault was not established, though the incident highlights ongoing behavioral risks within the facility.",
