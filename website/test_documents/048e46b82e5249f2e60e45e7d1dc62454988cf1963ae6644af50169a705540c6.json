    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12205 Required staff\nSection (8) An agency shall employ or contract for a sufficient number of\nDescription competent staff to carry out the provisions covered by these rules.\nThe workload for each staff member may not be more than any of\nthe following:\n(b) Fifteen children assigned to a social services worker for\npurposes of providing direct services in foster care,\nindependent living, adoption, or post adoption services or a\ncombination thereof.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The facility does not have enough case managers to manage the\ncases they have and are unable to fulfill the case management\nrequirements.\nInvestigation MDHHS Purchase of Service Foster Care supervisor (MDHHS\nPOS FC supervisor) was interviewed via telephone on\nSeptember 3, 2025. She stated she was notified by her Program\nManager Holy Cross had three staff abruptly quit and walk out on\nAugust 12, 2025. She believed the staff included two direct\nworkers and one supervisor.\nShe stated she and BSC 1 & 3 Private Agency Foster Care Key\nPerformance Indicator Analyst were asked to go over to Holy\nCross Muskegon office and assist them. She clarified this\nhappened 2 days after the workers and supervisor had walked\nout. She stated she was there all day and assisted with\nreassignments for the agency cases and ensuring correct staff\nwere assigned to cases. They went through all the cases and\ndetermined upcoming activities they needed to be aware of such\nas court hearings or any reports that may be due. At the end of\nthat day Staff 1 had 22 cases on his load. She stated there\nweren’t other options at that time since Staff 2 was new and could\nonly take 5 cases. Staff 3 had not started new worker training yet\nand wasn’t able to take any cases. Over the following week she\nfollowed up with the agency and inquired what was being done to\nget some of the cases off Staff 1’s load as it wasn’t possible for\none worker to manage 22 cases. She stated she inquired who\nwas doing parenting time, attending court and writing the reports.\nThey were working quickly to transfer cases to other Private\nAgency Foster Care (PAFC) agencies to determine any cases that\ncould be closed and what activities needed to be completed in\norder to get those closed.\n2",
    "She felt the agency was doing what they could to get cases\ntransferred but some of it took time because there were activities\nthat needed to be completed before the other agency would\naccept transfer.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via teleconference\non September 4, 2025. She stated on August 12, 2025, three\nstaff, one supervisor and two direct workers, abruptly quit and\nwalked out. As soon as the staff quit, she had a support staff\ncontact all the foster homes and caregivers to inform them of what\nhad occurred and make sure they had the on-call phone number\nand support staff phone number. The two remaining case workers,\nStaff 1 and Staff 2, contacted the parents from the cases to\nschedule monthly meetings and let them know they would be\nassigned a new worker.\nCA stated at that point the agency had one fully trained staff, Staff\n1, and a new staff, Staff 2, who was still in new worker training\nand could only take 3 cases. CA stated Staff 1 had up to 22 cases\nat one point while the agency was actively working on transferring\ncases back to DHHS and some to other private agencies in the\narea. She stated they needed to wait for the case transfer\nmeetings and there were a few cases that needed some activities\nto be completed before they could be transferred. Most of the\ncases were transferred on September 2, 2025. CA stated as of\nSeptember 4, 2025, Staff 1 had 15 cases, Staff 2 is further along\nin new worker training and is now able to take 5 cases and there\nis a newly hired staff, Staff 3, who just started new worker training,\nand she has 3 cases.\nBSC 1 & 3 Private Agency Foster Care Key Performance\nIndicator Analyst (KPI Analyst) was interviewed via telephone\non September 17, 2025. She works with the agency every month\non their KPI’s for the Modified Implementation, Sustainability and\nExit Plan (MISEP). She knew a supervisor and direct worker at the\nagency had put in their notice, and their last scheduled day was\nAugust 20, 2025. At that point she was already working with the\nagency on a succession plan for how they would address the loss\nof staff.\nKPI Analyst stated after three staff walked out on August 12,\n2025, the agency was left with only one fully trained staff (Staff 1).\nStaff 2 was in new worker training and was only able to have 3\ncases; however, was within a few days of being able to have 5\ncases. KPI Analyst stated she and MDHHS POS FC supervisor\n3",
    "dropped everything to formulate a plan to assist the agency to\ntransfer cases and determine what case activities needed to be\ncompleted. She stated they identified approximately 6 cases that\ncould have already been closed. They tried to target those and get\nthose closed. She contacted another PAFC in the area about\ntaking some cases. Some of the remaining cases had reports that\nwere due within a week or a court hearing within a week and an\nagency willing to accept the transfer needed to have those things\ncompleted before accepting the transfer.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• August 13, 2025, email to DCWL from Chief Administrator.\n“I wanted to notify you that we had three of our staff from\nour Muskegon office who walked off the job yesterday thus\nleaving us short two workers and one supervisor. We are\nworking through case assignments and case transfers with\nMDHHS. I am available for further conversation should you\nneed to speak about this today.”\n• MISACWIS case review for Staff 1 as of October 1, 2025.\nStaff 1 was assigned as primary FCW for 10 cases with a\ntotal of 16 youth.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of MISACWIS information, the agency was\naware at least two staff had put in their notice in early August\n2025 and did not appear to have a plan for closing or transferring\ncases upon their departure. As of October 1, 2025, MISACWIS\ncase review determined Staff 1 is still out of caseload compliance\ndespite adequate time to address case activities needed to\ntransfer or close the cases to reduce the number of cases\nassigned.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12202 Policy and procedures\nSection (1) An agency shall have and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures for the areas of foster care services as provided in R\n400.12203 to R 400.12214.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff provided confidential information to a party outside of the\nagency.\nInvestigation Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via teleconference\non September 4, 2025. She stated former agency Foster Care\nworker (former FCW) was one of the staff who quit and walked out\non August 12, 2025. Upon her abruptly quitting, the CEO of the\nagency was reviewing email accounts and found an email former\nFCW wrote on July 30, 2025, to another PAFC in the area. In the\nemail she indicates she is working with two homes that wish to be\nlicensed, and the Holy Cross Muskegon office does not have a\nlicensing team and would like to refer them. She provided the\nother PAFC with names, phone numbers and email addresses for\nthe two homes. CA clarified that former FCW had already put in\nher notice to quit at the time she walked out, and she was going to\nwork for the other PAFC who she provided the confidential\ninformation to. CA clarified the agency had a licensing worker at\nthat time and there would be no reason to contact another agency\nabout licensing one of their homes.\nFormer agency Foster Care worker (former FCW) was\ninterviewed via telephone on September 17, 2025. She stated\nshe was employed at Holy Cross until August 12, 2025. She\nstated at the time she left the agency there was a licensing\nworker, but she rarely saw the individual and wasn’t clear on the\ncurrent situation of the licensing department at Holy Cross. She\nstated she worked with a caregiver who had been trying to\nbecome licensed and was frustrated by the lack of communication\nfrom the licensing department at Holy Cross. During the interview\nthe email former FCW wrote regarding Foster Home 1 & Foster\nHome 2 was discussed. She stated Holy Cross licensing was not\nfollowing through with assisting Foster Home 2 on becoming\nlicensed. It was reported to her that no one from licensing had\nmade contact with the family since approximately January 2025.\nShe stated she had heard of a new agency in the area that was\nlicensing homes and thought they might be able to assist the\ncaregiver. Once she became aware she could not make the\nreferral she stopped pursuing that.\n5",
    "Documents reviewed:\n• July 30, 2025, email from former FCW to other area\nPAFC. “Good evening, My agency currently does not have\na licensing team in Muskegon so I’m hoping that you are\nable to accept these referrals. Please let me know if you\nhave any further questions! The homes are below: Foster\nHome 1 (provides their phone number and email address)\nand Foster Home 2 (provides their phone number and\nemail address).\n• Holy Cross Privacy & Security of Participant Records\nPolicy & Procedure.\nPolicy Statement: These regulations govern\nconfidentiality, privacy, and security of the records of\nparticipants, including records related to mental health,\nsubstance use, co-occurring, physical health and child\nwelfare-related services.\nImpermissible Use or Disclosure: The acquisition,\naccess, use, or disclosure of confidential information, PII, or\nPHI in a manner not permitted under HIPAA or other\napplicable confidentiality laws that may or may not\ncompromise the security or privacy of the confidential\ninformation, PII, or PHI.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of documentation, former FCW violated\nagency policies and procedures by providing confidential\ninformation regarding two of Holy Cross’ enrolled foster homes to\nanother PAFC. Former FCW only had access to this information\ndue to her position at Holy Cross and she was not given\npermission to share.\nConclusion Violation Established\n6",

    "summary": "The investigation found Holy Cross Services violated staffing and policy rules after three staff abruptly quit. A remaining worker was assigned up to 22 foster care cases, exceeding the 15-case limit, and a former worker improperly shared confidential foster home information with a competing agency. While the crisis was triggered by staff resignations, the agency is culpable for inadequate succession planning and failing to prevent the unauthorized data disclosure.",

    "justification": "The substantiated violations include a staffing/supervision failure (caseloads exceeding the rule of 15 per worker, with one worker having 22 cases, indicating a facility-level breakdown and failure to provide sufficient staff) and a policy violation involving the impermissible disclosure of confidential client information to an outside party. These align with the 'Moderate SIRs' categories of 'Environmental or supervision failures' and 'Administrative or Rights-Related Issues' (specifically policy violations raising compliance questions)."
