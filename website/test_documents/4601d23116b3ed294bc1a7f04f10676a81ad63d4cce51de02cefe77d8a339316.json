    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nCatholic Social Services of Washtenaw would like to add a foster care program to\ntheir current adoption program.\nIII. Methodology\nIn November 2012, CSS administration expressed a desire to expand their license to\ninclude a foster care program. The facility has adequate space and resources to\naccommodate this change. A proposed budget for the program was reviewed and\nfound to be clear and inclusive of their income and expenses.\nThey have hired an MSW level Foster Care and Licensing Supervisor with\nseventeen years of experience. This supervisor has CWTI supervisor training,\nCertification and Complaint training completed. Appropriate job descriptions have\nbeen developed for a foster care worker, licensing worker, and the foster\ncare/licensing supervisor. The agency plans to hire licensing and foster care workers\nupon approval of this license addendum.\nThe agency has provided copies of all required policies and procedures.\nAdditionally, agency staff were open to feedback and made adjustments as\nrecommended. The foster parent handbook, including policies and procedures, was\nreviewed and covered all areas required.\nThe agency has identified recruitment and retention strategies and has joined the\nWashtenaw County coalition, in order to strengthen their efforts.\nAdditionally, CSS is in the process of obtaining a foster care contract with the State\nof Michigan. The foster care program will be located in the current CSS Washtenaw\nCounty office. However, the agency plans to also work with Jackson, Livingston,\nLenawee, Hillsdale, Branch, and Monroe counties.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nOverall it seems that Catholic Social Services has a solid understanding of the\nrequirements for an agency to run a foster care program. They have formed\npartnerships with other agencies through the Washtenaw County Coalition and\nunderstand the needs of this area.\nAfter reviewing their policies, procedures and budget, it appears that CSS is\nprepared to launch their FC program with a thorough understanding of licensing\nexpectations, MSA requirements and DHS policies.\n2",
    "V. Recommendation\nThe recommendation is to add the following service types to the existing CSS\nlicense: Certify foster homes for license, Place children in foster homes\n3/5/2013\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\n3"
