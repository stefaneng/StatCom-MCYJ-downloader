    "02/28/2022 Contact – Document Sent\nEmails exchanged with Director.\nALLEGATION:\nOn 1/15/22, Youth A engaged in a physical altercation with another youth at the\nfacility. Staff member who broke up the altercation allegedly choked Youth A. No\ninjuries were observed, and camera footage reportedly does not support this. ID\n88276881\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received 01/24/22 and investigated jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The original allegations were as follows,\nYouth A (14) is currently placed at Calumet Center. Supervisor 1 is a supervisor\nat the facility. On 01/15/2022, Youth A had a physical altercation with another\npeer at the facility. When Supervisor 1 broke up the fight he choked Youth A. It is\nunknown how she was choked and was not observed marks or bruises. The\ncameras at the facility were reviewed and there is no evidence Youth A was\nchoked. Supervisor 1 is no longer working in the area Youth A resides in.\nI interviewed the Director on 01/24/22, at the facility, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The Director reported that she had reviewed the incident and\naccompanying video and reported the allegations from Youth A’s grievance. The\nDirector reported that she did not witness any choking by the supervisor on video.\nSupervisor 1 has been removed from contact with Youth A pending the outcome of\nthe investigation. When discussing the incident report, the Director reported that the\nincident report noted both youths saw the nurse, but the Director said they did not.\nThey had been seen by medical since the incident, but for other reasons.\nThe video of this incident shows the group of residents and staff on the pod. Youth A\nwas viewed getting out of her seat and taking an item from Youth B. Staff separated\nYouth A from Youth B by walking her away. Youth B went toward Youth A and the\ntwo started exchanging punches and grabbed onto one another. The Staff tried to\nseparate them. Supervisor 2 and Supervisor 1 approached and also began to\nseparate the girls from one another. Although the incident occurred on the opposite\nend of the room, and was not completely clear, it did not appear that Supervisor 1 or\n2 choked Youth A during the separation. Supervisor 1 escorted Youth A to her\nbedroom. Youth B was briefly physically managed by Supervisor 2 and then\nescorted to her bedroom.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility, on 01/25/22, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nYouth A reported feeling safe and had no other concerns about her placement.\nRegarding this incident, Youth A reported that she had a physical altercation with a\n3",
    "peer and Supervisor 1 choked her because he thought she was fighting the staff.\nYouth A said Supervisor 1 put his hand on her neck and noted they were face to\nface. This reportedly occurred by the window on the pod, near the shower. Youth A\nsaid his hand was on her neck for about four seconds, but she did not have any\ntrouble breathing. Youth A said she had no marks or bruises. She did not see a\nnurse afterward. Youth A said that she was then restrained and taken to her\nbedroom. She explained the restraint and escort as being held with her arms behind\nher back. Youth A said that Supervisor 1 told her to calm down and she was able to\nquickly come back out of her room without being locked in. Youth A said she has not\nhad any other issues like this.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 01/25/22. Youth B recalled the incident and\nreported a consistent account as reported by Youth A and as viewed on video.\nYouth B said that during the altercation, Youth A had ahold of Youth B’s hair. Youth\nB was not sure how the staff and supervisors got them separated. After they were\nseparated, Youth B said they were each escorted to their rooms. Youth B reported\nno injuries and noted she did not see the nurse. Youth B did not recall seeing\nanyone get choked during the incident.\nI interviewed Youth C at the facility on 01/25/22. Youth C reported that she saw the\nfight between Youth A and Youth B and noted that Supervisor 1 and the Staff broke\nit up. Youth C did not recall seeing anyone being choked during the incident.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1, jointly with the DHHS Specialist, at the facility on\n01/25/22. Supervisor 1 provided a consistent account of the incident as reviewed on\nvideo. Supervisor 1 said he was in the hall when he got a call for security to assist.\nWhen he got on the pod, Supervisor 1 said Youth A had ahold of someone’s hair.\nSupervisor 1 said that he took ahold of Youth A’s arms from behind. He said that it\nwas not a full restraint hold, but he was able to secure Youth A’s arms to transport\nher to her room. Supervisor 1 said that he does not like putting a female youth in a\nfull restraint hold to transport her if he can avoid it. Supervisor 1 denied putting his\nhands on Youth A’s neck or otherwise choking Youth A. Supervisor 1 said that both\nyouths saw the nurse, but he could not recall which nurse they saw.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2, jointly with the DHHS Specialist, at the facility on\n01/25/22. Supervisor 2 reported that he was trying to talk to another resident who\nwas upset when he heard a “commotion.” Supervisor 2 said that Youth A and Youth\nB were fighting so he called security and then tried to separate the girls. Supervisor\n2 said that Supervisor 1 pulled Youth A off of Youth B because Youth A was holding\nonto Youth B’s hair. Supervisor 1 then walked Youth A to her bedroom. Supervisor 2\nsaid that he then escorted Youth B to her room. Supervisor 2 denied seeing anyone\nbeing choked. Supervisor 2 said he only saw Supervisor 1 hold Youth A from under\nher arms.\nIn a 02/08/22 email exchange, the Director confirmed that neither youth were seen\nby the nurse for this incident on the day of, or the day after this incident.\n4",
