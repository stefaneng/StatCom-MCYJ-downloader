INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12417 Foster Parent Information\nSection (1) An agency shall provide a foster parent with all of the following\nDescr information before the placement or replacement of a child:\nChrist Child (f) All known behaviors of the child.\nDetroit - Child\n1",
    "Placing\nInstitution (CPA)\nption\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster parent did not receive information about child’s behaviors\nprior to placement.\nInvestigation The Chief Administrator was interviewed via video on March\n1, 2023. The Chief Administrator reported that Foster Child A was\nplaced with the Complainant from January 24, 2022, to February\n1, 2022, and again from February 16, 2022, to October 31, 2022.\nThe Chief Administrator reported that the case worker will typically\ninform the foster parent of issues and concerns about a child to be\nplaced in the home. The Chief Administrator also reported that\nwhen a child moves from one foster home to another the agency\nwill provide the foster homes of their respective phone numbers so\nthey can share information about the child before placement. The\nChief Administrator reported that Staff 1, who is the worker for\nFoster Child A, left the agency on March 4, 2022, and retained a\nposition with Marquette/Alger/Schoolcraft DHHS. At that time\nFoster Child A’s case was transferred to that county office. The\nChief Administrator reported that Staff 1 was a very good and\ncapable worker and that she could provide me with details of the\ncase. The Chief Administrator added that the Complainant never\ncontacted the agency with concerns about not being provided\nrelevant information about Foster Child A upon placement.\nThe agency Program Supervisor was also interviewed during\nthe video interview with the Chief Administrator on March 1,\n2023.\nThe Program Supervisor reaffirmed that the agency had never\nreceived concerns from the Complainant regarding a lack of\ninformation about Foster Child A’s behavioral issues upon\nplacement. The Program Supervisor reported that it is agency\npractice to connect foster parents with one another to share\ninformation when a child is to be replaced. The Program\nSupervisor reported that Staff 1 is a good worker and she would\nbe able to provide more detail about the placement of Foster Child\nA into the home of the Complainant.\nStaff 1, the former agency case worker and now the current\nDHHS Worker was interviewed via phone on March 7, 2023.\nStaff 1 reported that when Foster Child A was placed in the home\nof the Complainant there was little information to provide her with\nregarding behavioral concerns. The previous foster home had not\n2",
    "reported behavioral concerns and was preparing to adopt Foster\nChild A. Foster Child A was removed from this home when there\nwere safety concerns involving a MIC investigation.\nStaff 1 reported that when Foster Child A was placed with the\nComplainant there were some “ups and downs” but nothing\nserious. Staff 1 reported that when Foster Child A was placed a\nsecond time at the home of the Complainant she informed the\nComplainant that Foster Child A will take cell phones and get onto\nsocial media.\nStaff 1 reported that she provided Foster Parent 1 and the\nComplainant with cell phone numbers so they could share\ninformation about Foster Child A when the child was placed a\nsecond time with the Complainant. Foster Child A was placed with\nFoster Parent 1 from February 1, 2022, to February 16, 2022. This\nplacement was an interim placement between the two placements\nwith the Complainant. Staff 1 reported that she did not have a\nwritten record of providing Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2\nwith their phone numbers.\nOn March 7, 2023, Foster Parent 1, was called and a voice\nmail message left asking for a return call.\nFoster Parent 1 was interviewed via phone on March 23, 2023.\nFoster Parent 1 reported that Staff 1 had provided her the phone\nnumber of the Complainant and that she and the Complainant had\na phone conversation about Foster Child A. Foster Parent 1\ninformed the Complainant that she had concerns about Foster\nChild A and that she felt the child needed residential treatment.\nFoster Parent 1 further reported that she had transported Foster\nChild A to the placement at the Complainants home and had at\nthat time provided the Complainant with additional information\nabout Foster Child A’s behaviors. Foster Parent 1 reported that\nshe informed the Complainant that Foster Child A had flirting\nbehaviors and that she needed “healing tools”.\n3",
    "The Complainant was interviewed via phone on March 23,\n2023.\nThe Complainant reported that she did not receive any information\nabout Foster Child A prior to or upon placement. The Complainant\nreported that in a phone call from UP Kids she was told that\nFoster Child A had some behavioral issues but was not given\nspecifics. The Complainant further reported that Staff 1 had told\nher that Foster Child A “really doesn’t have any behavioral\nissues”. The Complainant reported that when Foster Child A was\nplaced with them that she would steal and that she had engaged\nin cutting behaviors. The Complainant was asked if she had\nreceived the phone number of Foster Parent 1 from Staff 1 so they\ncould share information. The Complainant denied that she was\ngiven Foster Parent 1’s phone number. The Complainant denied\nthat she and Foster Parent 1 had talked about Foster Child A prior\nto her placement in her home.\nThe Complainant was asked why she was filing a complaint at this\ntime since time had elapsed since the initial placement in January\n2022. The Complainant stated, “I was trying to take the higher\nroad” and not file a complaint but decided to file the complaint\nwhen there were recent allegations against my son that he had\ninappropriately touched Foster Child A when she was placed in\nthe home.\nAnalysis The Chief Administrator and Program Supervisor reported that the\nagency case worker will inform the foster parent of a child’s\nbehaviors prior to placement and that is agency practice to\nconnect foster parents with each other’s phone numbers to share\ninformation. The Chief Administrator and Program Supervisor\nreported that the Complainant had never contacted the agency\nwith a concern that she had not received information about the\nbehaviors of Foster Child A at the time of placement.\nStaff 1 reported that there was limited information at the time of\nplacement. Staff 1 reported that she had provided Foster Parent 1\nand the Complainant of their respective phone numbers at or\naround the time of the second placement at the Complainants\nhome. Staff 1 also reported she informed the Complainant that\nFoster Child A will take cell phones and use social media. Staff 1\nreported that the Complainant had never contacted her with\nconcerns that she had not received information about Foster Child\nA’s behaviors at or prior to placement.\n4",
    "Foster Parent 1 reported that she received the phone number of\nthe Complainant from Staff 1 and that she and the Complainant\nhad talked on the phone about Foster Child A’s behaviors.\nThe Complainant denied that she had received information from\nStaff 1 or the agency about Foster Child A prior to or at\nplacement. The Complainant denied that Staff 1 had provided her\nwith the phone number of Foster Parent 1 or that they had a\nphone conversation about Foster Child A.\nEvidence is conflicted regarding whether the Complainant\nreceived behavioral information about Foster Child A prior to or at\nplacement.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED: The agency lacked\ndocumentation which described efforts of the agency to\ninform a prospective foster parent of known behaviors of a\nfoster child. If an agency worker informs a prospective foster\nparent of a child’s behaviors this should be documented in\nthe social work contacts. Any efforts such as the agency’s\nreported practice of connecting foster parents with phone\nnumbers should also be documented. If behaviors are\nunknown documentation that the foster parent was informed\nas such should be documented.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nThe recommendation is for continuance of the regular license.\n_ April 25, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDouglas W Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\n5",
