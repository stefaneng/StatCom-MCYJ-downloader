ANALYST REPORT\nNo safety alerts were reported by the DCWL analyst.\nV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nYoung Adult Voluntary Foster Care- The agency was reminded that licensing rules\nfor independent living apply to YAVFC youth. YAVFC is the youth’s legal status,\nwhile IL is the placement and therefore IL rules apply.\nVI. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nIt was discussed with the agency how they have attempted to meet requirements\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, while offices have been closed, and face to face\ncontacts were limited. The agency continues to implement strategies and were open\nto additional suggestions.\nVII. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP, approved 11/7/19, was the result of the 10/22/19 renewal evaluation.\nDuring the current review period the facility was found to have six repeat violations in\nthe areas of Foster Parent information, Service Plan timeliness, PATP signatures,\n10",
    "Medical Passports, FTMs, and timely contract entry. Four of these repeat violations\nwere also found in the 2018 interim review (report dated 1/7/19, CAP approved\n1/28/19). As these areas continue to have violations, a thorough CAP needs to be\ndeveloped to address why the previous CAPs did not resolve the issue, and what\nnew steps will be taken to ensure compliance over the next year. As always, DCWL\nis available to provide consultation during CAP development and implementation.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, ISEP requirements, or policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\nOctober 27, 2020\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 16, 2020\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n11"
