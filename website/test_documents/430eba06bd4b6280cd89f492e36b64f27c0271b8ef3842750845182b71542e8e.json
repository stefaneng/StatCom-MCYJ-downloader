INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404 Placement\nSection (4) An agency shall consider all of the following factors in selecting\nDescription an appropriate placement for a child:\n(b) The physical, emotional, and educational needs of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency was provided a safety alert in September 2022 and\nnot all of the issues were resolved. The agency moved a youth\nbased on some unresolved issues and additional issues, leaving 5\nyouth in an unsafe home.\nInvestigation This investigation was opened after DCWL analyst follow up with\nthe agency on a 09/26/22 safety alert brought up concerns related\nto the safety of the relative placement.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nReview of the safety alert dated 9/26/22. Safety alert indicates the\nrelative care providers home had no working smoke detectors or\ncarbon monoxide detectors, three windows needed repair (glass\nand screens were missing), one window was unable to close, (two\nchildren sleep in this room) electrical issues (3 bedrooms have no\nworking outlets and bathroom lights do not work), the electrical\nappears to be a safety issue and sewage was observed in the\nbasement.\nThe agency reported on the safety alert, and noted they were able\nto resolve the smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector\nissue. They were able to repair the three windows that needed\nglass and screens. One window was unable to close but they\nwere able to close it more and placed a thick cloth over the\nopening to stop the cold air from coming in. The window required\na custom fix, and they contacted a window company to assist. The\nagency purchased battery operated lighting for the bathroom and\nbedrooms and contacted an electrician to evaluate and fix the\nelectrical issue. A plumber was able to clean up and fix the\nsewage issue.\nReview of the safety alert email updates between the DCWL\nAnalyst and Wolverine from October 2022-February 2023. On\n10/13/22 the Field Analyst requested an update from Wolverine in\nregard to resolving the safety alert. Wolverine emailed indicating\n2",
    "the home has cockroaches and a bed bug infestation and the\nwindow company and electrician both cancelled and would not\ncome into the home to complete repairs or do estimates. An\nexterminator was hired, and the first extermination treatment was\n10/13/22 and the second treatment would be the following week.\nOnce the second treatment was complete the home should be\nfully treated, and the window and electrician could be contacted to\nenter the home and complete the necessary work.\nDCWL Analyst requested update on 11/28/22. No response was\ndocumented.\nJanuary 11, 2023, the DCWL Analyst asked for a safety alert\nupdate. Wolverine’s response email indicated the home continued\nto have a bug infestation even after the extermination treatments.\nThe agency said that the relative care provider is not complying\nafter multiple meetings and they agency is looking for replacement\nhomes for the children.\nO 2/9/23 the DCWL Analyst requested a safety alert update from\nWolverine. Wolverine email response was that the children were\nmoving the next day; 2/10/23.\nThe agency provided a detailed outline of their efforts to assist the\nfamily with the safety alerts/concerns in the home which included\nthe following:\n• August 2022 the agency discovered the bedframes DHHS\nprovided to the family were broken and unsafe to be used.\nThe family was instructed to take them down due to safety\nconcerns and the mattresses were placed on the floor for\neach child to sleep on.\n• September 2022 the licensing worker discovered a hole in\nthe stairwell wall, a smoke alarm was needed in the\nbasement, broken windows in some of the rooms, and the\nchildren's beds were missing. A smoke detector was\ninstalled in the basement at the visit. Standing water was in\nthe basement from a shower leak. The relative care\nprovider had thrown away the mattresses indicating they\nwere dirty, so the children did not have beds. The agency\ntook air mattresses to the home for all the children. A\nsafety plan was implemented for the children to sleep in\ntheir assigned room on the air mattresses. It was\ndiscovered on 9/27/22 that the home was infested with\ncoach roaches. On 9/28/22, a plumber was scheduled to\ngo to the home and the issues were resolved during that\nappointment regarding the standing water in the basement.\n3",
    "Windows and screens were replaced in September and\nbattery-operated lights for the bedroom and bathroom were\nprovided.\n• October 4, 2022, the licensing worker met the exterminator\ncompany for an estimate, and it was discovered the home\nalso had a bed bug infestation. The window company and\nelectrician who were scheduled to work in the home\nrefused to enter the home due to the bug infestations. It\nwas also discovered that day that the unsafe bunk beds\nwere still up, and the basement had no electricity. On\n10/13/22 the initial treatment for bed bugs and roaches was\ncompleted.\n• October 21, 2022, a Family Team Meeting was held with\nthe relative. Concerns discussed at the Family Team\nMeeting were the needed home repairs and the relative\ncare providers needed to keep up the home, the need for\nthe relative care provider to have employment/income,\nparenting concerns with ensuring the children's medical,\ndental, and mental health needs were being met. Medical\nappointments were missed and not attended.\n• November 14, 2022, the foster care worker met with the\nrelative care provider and discussed the need for legal\nincome and adoption documentation that had not been\nprovided. The relative's adult son who lived in the home\nreported the home had been infested with bed bugs and\nroaches for nearly 7 years at the visit. The exterminator\ntreatments were completed on 11/30/22.\n• There was a court hearing on 11/14/22 and the Referee\nexpressed concern with the relative placement’s lack of\ncare to the children and stated that children have been\nremoved from the care of birth parents for the same living\nconditions and lack of care. Referee strongly recommended\nthat the agency find a solution to the issues up to and\nincluding removing the children from the relative care\nprovider.\n• On 12/5/22 a Family Team Meeting occurred with the\nrelative care provider where they discussed the need for\nlegal income and legal documents for the adoption. At a\nhome visit on 12/5/22 it was discovered that the air\nmattresses provided to the relative were all broken, and the\nrelative had not reported this which was part of the safety\nplan developed around safe sleep. The agency provided\nthree beds for the family on 12/5/22. A case conference\noccurred on 12/21/22 with foster care, adoption, licensing,\nGAL, and DHHS and it was agreed the children should be\nremoved from the relative home.\n4",
    "• On 1/6/23 a case conference request was sent to MCI to\nseek permission to remove the children. Approval was\nprovided without a conference to the facility by MCI. MCI\nrequested they seek a foster home that could take all five\nchildren. On 1/27/23 the agency requested permission to\nsplit the children as they could not locate one foster home\nfor all five children. MCI approved a sibling split on\n1/30/23. On 2/10/23 the relative care provider was given\nthe DHHS -30 notification of replacement, and the children\nwere removed and placed in two foster homes. The\nagency reported the children were replaced due to the\nrelative being unwilling to obtain legal income, unwilling to\nprovide the documents for adoption/provide permanency,\nthe lack of follow through with the agency for appointments\nand the children's appointments, the bug infestation,\ninability to fix the window and electrical, on-going bedding\nissues for the children.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed the Foster Care Worker on 3/2/23 via the phone. She\nreported that she has been the foster care worker since the\nagency accepted the case from the department. The Foster Care\nworker reported that she had a pretty good relationship with the\nrelative in the beginning, but the relationship deteriorated over\ntime as the relative became less compliant and more combative\nwith her. The Foster Care Worker reported the first concern she\nhad was over medicals for the children taking over 4 months to get\ncompleted. The Foster Care Worker reported income was an\nissue in the home as the relative care provider did not want to\nwork. The Foster Care Worker reported the relative care provider\nexpected the agency to fix all of the issues she had with her\nhome. The relative was often not forthcoming with the issues in\nthe home, and new things kept coming up. The Foster Care\nworker reported there was a large electricity bill that was unpaid,\nthe lights in the house were an issue and worked in only some\nrooms, the beds were frequently broken, and the children were not\nsleeping in their designated rooms. The relative care provider\ndiscarded the beds that were purchased for her and allowed the\nchildren to jump on the beds and air mattresses resulting in them\nbeing broken frequently. The Foster Care Worker reported the\nrelative became combative with her in June of 2022 as she didn’t\nlike the Foster Care Worker questioning her about her income,\nbills, the beds etc. The Foster Care Worker reported the relative\nasked the Foster Care Worker to pay her property taxes and there\nwas a $2,000 utility bill. The Foster Care Worker reported the\nrelative did not communicate her needs and issues and she was\n5",
    "often finding out the issues after the fact. The Foster Care Worker\nreported in September the relative became more unresponsive\nand wouldn't answer her phone and became more difficult to work\nwith. The foster care worker reported the home felt unsafe in\nAugust/September 2022. The foster care worker reported she\nbrought up her concerns to her supervisor and the supervisors\nkept pushing to get resources to help the relative. The Foster Care\nWorker reported the relative became most combative in\nNovember after court. The Foster Care Worker reported in\nDecember it was determined the placement was not safe due to\nstill having bed bugs, cock roaches, the relative not complying\nwith requests, beds broken again, the air mattresses were broken\nagain, and the relative was not following the safety plan, had no\nincome, and continued to have safety issues in the home\n(electrical and window).\nI interviewed the Adoption Supervisor on 3/28/23 via the phone.\nThe Adoption Supervisor reported that she was the adoption\nworker on the case. She received the case on 8/15/22. The\nAdoption Supervisor reported safety concerns at her first home\nvisit. Those concerns were that the relative slept in the dining\nroom, that she couldn't go into the basement as there was no\nelectricity, all the children were sharing one bedroom, she needed\na flashlight to illuminate the upstairs. The Adoption Supervisor\nreported there was a constant concern with the children sharing\nbedrooms and not following the safety plan. The Adoption\nSupervisor reported the agency provided air mattresses 2-3 times\ndue to them being popped and the family had an on-going bug\ninfestation. The Adoption Supervisor reported the relative was\nasked for adoption paperwork multiple times and only provided a\nsmall amount of the necessary paperwork. The Adoption\nSupervisor reported the relative did not have a legal source of\nincome. The Adoption Supervisor reported she couldn't have\ndone an adoption in the home due to the poor condition of the\nhome including spotty electricity, bugs, basement was unsafe with\nno electrical, broken windows and standing water in the\nbasement. The Adoption Supervisor reported the relative care\nprovider couldn't meet the needs of the children. She reported the\nchildren missed medical appointments and the relative stopped\ngoing to appointments. The adoption supervisor reported she had\nconcerns with the relative’s parenting skills that the children were\nclean but one of the children was not speaking yet and had\nlanguage issues, one was not potty trained, and she didn't go to\nan intake appointment for one of the children to be assessed. The\nAdoption Supervisor reported the children were never in imminent\ndanger or immediate risk of harm. The Adoption Supervisor\n6",
    "reported the children were replaced without notice or visitation\nwith their new placements due to fear of the relative\nleaving/running with the children if provided notification of\nreplacement. The Adoption Supervisor reported the relative never\nthreatened to leave with the children, but it was just a fear the\nagency had. The children were removed from school and placed\nin new foster homes. The Adoption Supervisor reported the\nrelative did not have an intense reaction and cried, but agreed if\nthe agency felt it was best for the children. The adoption\nsupervisor reported the agency was concerned with the relative’s\nmental health and that she had a CPS history and was reportedly\nsuffering from mental health issues, but they never saw any signs\nor unusual behavior and the relative did not take medication.\nI interviewed the Foster Care Supervisor on 2/9/23 via teams.\nThe Foster Care Supervisor reported the relative home was clean\nand safe, but her care of the children was poor. She went on to\nsay the initial well child exams took 4 months. The Foster Care\nSupervisor reported the relative allowed the children to jump on\nthe beds and break them. The Foster Care Supervisor reported\nthat they did written safety plans to address concerns with beds.\nThe Foster Care Supervisor reported over time the relative\nstopped answering the phone and became hard to get a hold of or\nwork with. The Foster Care Supervisor reported they provided air\nmattresses for the children several times.\nI interviewed the Child Welfare Director on 2/9/23 via Teams\nconference. She reported that CPS did the initial placement with\nthe relative and it was a struggle with the relative all along. The\nDirector reported they attempted to work with the relative for\nseveral months as they were concerned that the children had lived\nwith the relative for most of their lives. The Director indicated it is\nreally hard to move kids from a relative and they tried really hard\nto preserve the placement but the relative would not comply and\nnew conditions in the home kept coming up. The Director reported\non 12/5/23 they determined the children would need to move from\nthe relatives home due to the conditions in the home, lack of\npermanency, and the relatives lack of doing what she needed to\ndo to provide for the children. The Director reported the children\nwere moved without notification due to concerns with the relative’s\nmental health. The Director reported the relative had a history with\nCPS that alleged she tried to smother one of her own kids. The\nDirector reported they wanted to make sure the relative was not\ngoing to retaliate in any way with the children. The Director\ndenied that they had ever had any concerns with the relative’s\n7",
    "mental health and have never experienced her displaying unusual\nbehavior during the case.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews and a review of documentation there is\nevidence to support the physical, emotional, and educational\nneeds of the children were not being met in the relative\nplacement. The conditions of the home were a safety concern in\nAugust 2022 and continued to be a safety concern and increase in\nseverity as the case progressed. The children should have been\nremoved from the home when it became evident that the relative\nwas not cooperating, and they could not accomplish the repairs\nneeded in the home to make it safe. The court expressed concern\nwith the care for the children and the home conditions and ordered\nthe agency to resolve the issues and remove the children if\nnecessary. The children were not moved from the home for\nanother three months. The children were left in a placement that\nwas unsafe for several months.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nApril 10, 2023\n_________________________________________\nTracey Ventola Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 11, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n8"
