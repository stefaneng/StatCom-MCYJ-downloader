The CAP included training “Discipline vs. Punishment: The\nDifference In Child Development”, increased monthly contact with the foster parent\nby the licensing supervisor, case management assessment of behavior at monthly\nfoster home visits, and ongoing input with the child’s therapist about concerns or\nbehavior management techniques if needed. The CAP was completed on 2/9/22.\nThe foster parents are in compliance at this time, but the agency will continue to\nmonitor behavior management in this home.\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP, approved 1/19/2021, was a result of the 12/29/2020 renewal evaluation in\nwhich the agency had fifteen violations. During this interim review, the agency had\neight violations. However, four of the eight were repeat violations. The agency\nacknowledged in the Chief Administrator Assessment that they struggled in these\nfour areas due to staffing issues. During the review, the agency was receptive to\nsuggestions in each of these areas and had several ideas for a CAP. Overall, the\nagency showed improvement in several areas during this interim review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment, dated 9/30/21, was reviewed and discussed.\nThe agency reported successfully implementing the CAP from their 2021 renewal\nevaluation. Administration adjusted areas throughout the year, where the original\nwas not as effective as originally anticipated. Supervisors continue to monitor\nperformance data to determine how CAP adjustments have performed. The program\nmanager reported that policy clarification training, additional tracking of due dates,\nimplementation of new forms, and utilizing case aids in new ways, has all been\nhelpful over this past year. However, it was also noted that the agency still struggles\nwith timely entry of case contacts, signatures on PATPs, and medical passports. The\nAdministrator reported the Monthly Management Report shows the agency performs\nwell with service plan due dates, medical/dental exams, and supervision. The MMR\nalso shows the agency needs improvement on face-to-face contacts. The\n7",
    "Administrator stated that was likely due to some staffing struggles they faced this\npast year. Staffing was challenging at times due to significant growth in the program.\nAs well as absences due to COVID. The agency reported staffing has improved at\nthis time.\nStaff interviews\nContact occurred with agency licensing and foster care supervisors, and one foster\ncare worker. All staff reported feeling the agency was a supportive, positive work\nenvironment. All staff stated they have good relationships with co-workers and\nmanagers. The FCW stated their supervisor is accessible, helpful, knowledgeable,\nand responsive. Staff acknowledged that court in one particular county can be\nchallenging at times. However, there were no other concerns reported.\nVII. ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue\non a regular license.\nMarch 8, 2022\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 8, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
