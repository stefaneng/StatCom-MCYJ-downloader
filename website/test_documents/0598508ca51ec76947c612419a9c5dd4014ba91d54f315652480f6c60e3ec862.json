    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Former Youth J told Complainant he was suicidal when the facility\ndischarged him to his parents on 1/20/24. Hours later he was\naccepted for psychiatric hospitalization.\nInvestigation Safehaus Too does not contract with MDHHS and there is no\nworker assigned to Former Youth J’s case. His legal guardians\nare his parents. Safehaus Too does not have the authority to sign\nyouths into the hospital and they do not transport youths for\nexternal psychiatric evaluations. With the guardian’s permission\nSafehaus Too can complete an internal psychiatric evaluation\nonsite if needed.\nInterviews:\nOn 1/22/24 I notified Complainant/Hospital Social Worker that I\nwas assigned this investigation. She had no additional licensing\nconcerns pertaining to Safehaus Too.\nI contacted Director and requested Former Youth J’s discharge\npaperwork. I communicated with Chief Administrator via email\nand phone.\nOn 1/24/24 I interviewed Former Youth J, age 17, at Havenwyck\nHospital. He said he was at Safehaus for eight days and was\ndischarged to his parents on 1/20/24. On 1/19/24, he said he\ninformed a Safehaus Nurse he felt urges to harm himself and\nNurse was going to talk about it with staff. The next day on\n1/20/24 Former Youth J said he was not ready to go home with his\nmother and told her this when she came to pick him up. “She\n(mother) said she was ‘done with my ass and had shit to do.’ She\nleft me there and it hurt. Staff 1 dialed CPS and I talked to them.\nI told them I would kill myself if I went home with her (mother).\nClinical Director (via phone) told Supervisor I was to go to\ninpatient at Havenwyck Hospital. Supervisor gave me two\nchoices. I could take an ambulance to ER for a psychiatric\nevaluation or Supervisor would get my parents to come back to\nSafehaus Too and pick me up.” Former Youth J said his parents\n2",
    "returned to the facility to get him, but rather than take him directly\nto Havenwyck, they drove him home instead. “I stayed alone in\nthe car in my driveway for 40 minutes.” Then his parents drove\nhim for a psychiatric evaluation. Former Youth J was accepted for\ninpatient hospitalization and admitted to Havenwyck Hospital that\nsame day.\nI interviewed Clinical Director on 1/24/24. She has worked at\nSafehaus Too for four years. On Saturday 1/20/24, Clinical\nDirector was not at the facility, but was receiving phone calls from\nboth Youth J’s mother and Supervisor simultaneously. At the time\nof his initial discharge, she said Youth J became escalated after\nhis mother came and left without him. Over the phone, Clinical\nDirector said she heard Youth J threaten that if discharged to his\nmother, he would run away. “He was yelling asking to be put in\nthe foster care system. We explained we couldn’t do that. Then\nhe refused to be discharged and insisted he was staying. I\nconvinced his mother to return and verbally told her if Youth J was\nmaking suicidal threats, she should take him to the local\nemergency room.”\nClinical Director reported the following:\nA Depression Scale completed by Therapist with Youth J on\n1/11/24 at admission indicated a score of 13. A follow up\nDepression Scale completed on 1/19/24 indicated a score of 6,\nwhich is considered mild depression.\nNurse assessed Youth J on 1/18/24 and documented “thoughts of\nself-harm - absent.” Nurse assessed Youth J on 1/19/24 and\ndocumented “thoughts of self-harm – occasional.”\nOn checklists completed by Therapist on 1/18/24 and 1/19/24,\nsuicidal ideation was not identified. A Clinical Therapy note by\nTherapist on 1/19/24 indicated Youth J “presents with an\nappropriate affect and denies SI. He is at his baseline and his\ncrisis has stabilized. He is preparing for discharge from program\nand follow up with outpatient services.”\nDocuments reviewed:\nNurse assessments, Depression Scales and therapy notes\nprovided were consistent with Clinical Director’s verbal report.\nSafehaus Too Discharge Release Form dated 1/20/24 at 4:26pm\nsigned by Therapist on 1/19/24 indicated Youth J was admitted on\n1/11/24 due to suicidal ideation and depression. Significant\nfindings indicated “Alleviated suicidal ideation and impulses.\n3",
    "Returned to highest previous level of daily functioning…”\nDischarge condition indicated “Patient is at baseline and stable to\ncontinue with outpatient therapy. Discharge Home to legal\nguardian with outpatient appointment at Easterseals on 1/25/24 at\n1pm.”\nAnalysis Documentation dated 1/19/24 indicated Former Youth J was not\nsuicidal. However, when his mother arrived to pick him up from\nSafehaus Too on 1/20/24, he did not want to go with her. Youth\nJ’s mother became irritated and left him at the facility. The facility\ncontacted centralized intake and Former Youth J said he told the\nscreener he would kill himself if he went home with his mother. At\nthe same time, Clinical Director remotely via phone convinced the\nmother to return to Safehaus Too to pick up her child. His mother\nreturned and Youth J left with her after Clinical Director verbally\nadvised her to take him to the ER if he was making suicidal\nthreats. According to the youth, his mother drove him home\nwhere he stayed alone in the car for 40 minutes until she came\nout and drove him to the hospital where Complainant assessed\nhim for psychiatric hospitalization. He was accepted for inpatient\ntreatment and transported to Havenwyck Hospital.\nFormer Youth J was released to his mother (legal guardian) on\n1/20/24 and then taken to the hospital.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJanuary 26, 2024\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n4",

    "summary": "A youth at Safehaus Too expressed suicidal thoughts to a nurse prior to discharge, but clinical documentation from the day before indicated he was at baseline with denied suicidal ideation. Upon discharge to his mother, the youth refused to go, the mother left, and the youth threatened suicide to a CPS screener; the facility's Clinical Director, via phone, convinced the mother to return and verbally advised her to take him to the ER if he made suicidal threats, which she eventually did after a delay, leading to his psychiatric hospitalization. While the report concludes no licensing violation was established, the facility's discharge process and communication with the guardian failed to ensure immediate safety for a youth expressing acute risk.",
