Compliance\n07/28/2022 Pre exit/Exit mtg\nALLEGATION:\nOn 6/27/22, there was a physical altercation between youth and staff member at the\nfacility. Youth was on the ground and staff member had their sleeve pulled down to\ntheir hand and held their hand over youth's mouth for approximately a minute.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 6/30/22 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS worker. He reported remembering the restraint with Staff 1 but was\nunable to recall the specifics of the incident. He does not remember his actions\nwhen he begins hitting staff. He had no struggles breathing during the restraint with\nStaff 1. He reported everything goes well for him at the facility until he begins to hit\nstaff. When hitting staff things do not go well for him. He gave no specifics about\nthings not going well. He feels safe in the facility.\nAdministrator/Complainant was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n6/30/22 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported reviewing the restraint\non the video recording and noticing Staff 1 pulling his sleeve over his hand and\nplacing his hand over Youth A's mouth and nose. This resulted in Administrator",
    "calling DHHS. The video was reviewed after Staff 1 filed an assault complaint with\nthe local law enforcement who informed Administrator. Staff 1 has had no formal\ndiscipline since working at the facility and the only issues were dismissed. These\nissues will be listed in the file review section of this report. Administrator reported it\nappeared Supervisor 1 removed Staff 1's hand from Youth A's mouth/nose area\nafter he came upon the restraint. Staff 1 had his hand over the mouth/nose area of\nYouth A for approximately 40 seconds and this is not an appropriate restraint\ntechnique according to Administrator.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on 7/19/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. He reported being present during the incident and being involved in the\nrestraint. Youth A was being defiant when redirected to the back hallway after\ncausing a disturbance during a movie on the unit. The restraint was initiated\nbecause Youth A struck both Staff 1 and Staff 2 with a closed fist. The restraint\nbegan as a two-person standing hold but ended in a supine hold. Youth A was\nfighting the restraint by kicking, scratching, and hitting staff. Supervisor 1 and\nSupervisor 2 came to the restraint and Staff 2 \"tapped out\" because he was bleeding\nfrom a scratch by Youth A. Staff 2 also reported after he tapped out, Youth A went\ninto a standing 2-person hold before walking to his room. He believes Youth A may\nhave been trying to spit at staff, but this lasted only a few seconds. Staff 1 was trying\nto block the spit for a few seconds. Staff 1 had his hand above Youth A's mouth and\nnever covered or touched Youth A's mouth or nose. Staff 2 reported being present\nduring the nurse’s review and didn’t observe any marks on Youth A.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via telephone on 7/19/22 in collaboration with\nMDHHS worker. He reported entering the situation and finding Supervisor 2\nstruggling to hold the legs of Youth A and switching out with Staff 2 because Staff 2\nhad a cut on his hand. Youth A made threats of spitting but did not spit on\nSupervisor 1. Supervisor 1 also reported Youth A was on the ground for 2 to 3\nminutes before getting up to a seated position and then a standing position. Youth A\nthen went to his room. He described the positions of staff as, Staff 1 on the right side\nof Youth A, Staff 2 on the left side, and Supervisor 2 holding his legs. He also\nreported his primary focus was on Supervisor 2 struggling with Youth A's legs and\nhe did not see Staff 1's hand over Youth A's mouth. He did observe the video\nrecording and saw \"red flags” with Staff 1's hand appearing to be over the mouth of\nYouth A. However, at the time of the restraint he did not observe anything wrong\nwith the techniques being used. Staff are not trained to cover the mouth when a\nyouth is spiting but to turn their bodies and head to avoid being spit on. He reported\nnever hearing Youth A say he could not breathe during the restraint.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on 7/25/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. He reported being part of the restraint outlined in the allegations. The\nrestraint was the result of Youth A engaging in threatening behaviors towards Staff 1\nafter refusing the direction to return to the \"back hallway\" after his removal from the\ngroup activity (movie). Staff 1 attempted to deescalate Youth A, but it did not work\nand Youth A struck Staff 1 in the stomach. Youth A made several threatening",
    "remarks and Staff 1 only responded with desecration statements. Staff 1 continued\nto talk with Youth A before Youth A approached him and asked what he was going\nto do just before walking over to Staff 2 and punching him in the face. Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 then placed Youth A into a 2-person CPI standing position before going to the\nground. Once on the ground, Youth A was on his back (supine) with Staff 2 on his\nright side holding his arm and Staff 1 on his left side holding his arm. Supervisor 2\ncame into the restraint and secured Youth A's legs. Staff 1 also reported hearing\nYouth A \"making a sound like he is going to spit on me\". Staff 1 pulled his sleeve\nover his hand and puts his hand over Youth A's mouth as Youth A spits. Staff 1\nreported his hand was hovering over the mouth of Youth A and not touching the\nmouth or restricting his breathing. Youth A bit his hand/sleeve to keep Staff 1 from\nremoving his hand. Staff 1 \"fed the bite\" to get his hand/sleeve free and Youth A\nreleased his bite. Both Staff 1 and Staff 2 \"switched out\" with Supervisor 1 and Staff\n4. Youth A finally calmed down and was escorted to his room by Supervisor 1 and\nStaff 4. Staff 1 reported being taught to turn your back to a youth who is trying to spit\nbecause there is \"no CPI technique to block spitting\". Staff 1 reported he was only\ntrying to protect himself and his coworkers \"in a safe way\".\nDocuments Reviewed:\nHuman Resources file for Staff 1. Staff 1 is current on his training requirements\nand last completed a session on the facility's behavior management which is\nNonviolent Crisis Intervention (CPI) on 4/19/2022. Documentation indicates Staff 1\nwas accused of having oral sex with a female youth at the facility and this allegation\nwas documented in special investigation 2022C0137008. There were no findings,\nand the youth denied the allegations. Administrator reported no formal issues with\nStaff 1, but he did receive (unwritten) \"counseling\" when he sprayed a cleaning\nsolution and some of the solution came into contact with a youth.\nMiSACWIS Incident Report 138110198 dated 6/27/22. This is the document\noutlining the incident described in the complaint. The incident is described as Youth\nA refusing to follow directions given by staff and escalating to taking off his shirt and\napproaching Staff 1. Youth A attempted to push past Staff 1 when Staff 2 became\ninvolved resulting in both staff attempting a \"team control\" with Youth A punching\nStaff 2 in the face. Because of Youth A's aggressive behaviors, staff and Youth A\nwent to the ground resulting in a supine position. Supervisor 1 was able to\nencourage Youth A to stop being aggressive and walk to his room. Once at the\nroom, Youth A became escalated again before Supervisor 1 was able to deescalate\nhim. There is no documentation of Youth A spitting on staff or attempting to spit on\nstaff in this document. Staff involved were documented as Staff 1, Staff 2,\nSupervisor 1, and Supervisor 2.\nOakland County Children's Village Incident Report dated 6/27/22. This\ndocument indicates seclusion and assault on staff are reasons for the actions taken.\nThis document adds that Staff 1 was punched in the face by Youth A, Youth A\ngrabbed Staff 2's beard and was scratching and spitting. Youth A scratched Staff 2's",
    "left arm while in the supine position (there is no documentation that they fell to the\nground). Supervisor 2 is noted as assisting with the supine position and the de-\nescalation. Those involved are identified as Youth A, Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3,\nSupervisor 1, and Supervisor 2.\nCounty of Oakland Office of the Sheriff statement dated 6/29/22. This is\ndocumented as a statement from Staff 2 to law enforcement. This statement is like\nthe two incident reports with the exception that it indicates Youth A struck Staff 1 in\nthe face twice.\nManagement Plan for Youth A dated 6/13/2022. This document indicates Youth A\nis placed at the facility as \"temporary detain per court order\". His needs are identified\nas psychiatric consultation as needed, clinical and case management services and\nopportunities for recreational activities, visitation, education, and religious services.\nPhysical Interventions - Holding skills CPI. This document does not state\nanything specifically about a youth spitting or attempting to spit on staff during a\nrestraint on the floor. Staff are to manage the head of the youth \"in order to create a\nsafe physical intervention\". The diagram of the position a youth and the staff were in,\nindicates staff should have their back to the youth and a third staff is holding the\nyouth's head.\nA review of the video recordings took place.\n6-27-22 #1 J II Washington 7:50:29 PM. The recording begins with a above view of\nthe area all the youth are currently in. Youth A stands and takes off his shirt,\nundershirt and walks quickly towards Staff 1 who is standing several feet away.\nYouth A bumps into Staff 1 and appears to punch him in the stomach area. The\nother youth are lining up and leaving the area. Staff 2 walks to the area where Staff\n1 and Youth A are standing and Youth A punches Staff 2 in the head. Youth A\nmoves away to the other side of the room with Staff 1 and Staff 2 following. When\nthey reach the far corner, Youth A turns and punches Staff 1 in the head before both\nstaff begin to grab Youth A and start the restraint. The restraint begins with a 2-\nperson hold as described and Supervisor 2 enters the room and secures the legs of\nYouth A. Youth A is placed on the floor with Supervisor 2 on his legs, Staff 1 holding\nhis right arm and side, and Staff 2 holding his left arm and side. Supervisor 1 enters\nthe situation and switched out Staff 1. Because this is an overhead view, Youth A's\nhead area is blocked by staff and a clear view is unable to be seen.\n6-27-22 #2 J II Washington 7:50:54 PM. This camera view is more horizonal and\nprovided a clearer view of the head of Youth A. However, this view only lasts for a\nfew seconds before Staff 1 covers the view of Youth A’s head with his body as he\nadjusts his position. Prior to this, it appears Staff 1 had pulled his sleeve over his\nhand and placed his hand over the mouth and nose of Youth A. Because of the poor\nview and angel, it cannot be determined if Staff 1's hand is touching Youth A's mouth",
    "and nose. It does appear that Supervisor 1 moves Staff 1's hand away from the face\nof Youth A.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.159 Youth restraint.\n(5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the\nseverity of the youth’s behavior, chronological and\ndevelopmental age, size, gender, physical condition,\nmedical condition, psychiatric condition, and personal\nhistory, including any history of trauma, and must be done\nin a manner consistent with the youth’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in noncompliance as Staff 1 used an\ninappropriate technique during the restraint of Youth A. Placing\nhis hand (sleeve) close to or on Youth A’s mouth and nose is\nnot taught by the behavior management program the facility\nuses.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt was recommended the facility retrain their staff on the\nappropriate method to utilize when a youth is spitting or\nattempting to spit on staff.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0217013 dated 12/16/21, CAP Approved 12/27/22\nIII. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend upon receipt of an acceptable corrective no change be made to the\nlicense status of this child caring institution\n7/27/22\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
