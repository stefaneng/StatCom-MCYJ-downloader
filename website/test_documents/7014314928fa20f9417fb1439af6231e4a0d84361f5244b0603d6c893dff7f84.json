Review Manager X provided advisement with\nrespect to my special investigation exploration.\nAgency Staff:\nEntrance Conference/ Chief Operating Officer 3\nOn 2/3/2023 I meet with Chief Administrator 1(who was the chief\nadministrator at the onset of this special investigation),\n3",
    "Administrator 2, and Chief Operating Officer (COO) 3 related to\nthe allegations. COO 3 was the spokesperson during this meeting.\nI also had email correspondence with COO 3 on 2/28/2023.\nWe discussed the financial concern allegation as\ndocumented/outlined by a 1/11/2023 Michigan Department of\nHealth and Human Services (MDHSS) Audit and Review\nMemorandum related to Wolverine Human Services’ fiscal year\n2021 review. This memorandum referenced Notes number 5 and\n12 from the agency’s 2021 Financial Audit, related to possible\nfinancial instability for the agency.\nCOO 3 voiced concern as to why this complaint allegation came\nthrough related to Wolverine’s child placing agency (CPA)license\nwhen the debt in question relates to the organization’s prior child\ncaring institution (CCI) license. COO 3 advised he had addressed\nthis complaint matter with DCWL’s (Division of Child Welfare\nLicensing) Director XX, as to why DCWL was connecting this CPA\nlicense to the allegation. He said, Director XX reported, it was\neasier to address the complaint matter this way. COO 3 reported\nthe Department had been aware of the agency’s challenges,\nbecause the agency’s program losses have been expressed with\nthe Department yearly, especially during COVID. He reported the\nagency surrendered its Wolverine Secure Treatment Center\n(WSTC) program’s license in 2021. He reported the bulk of the\ndebt this allegation relates connects to the WSTC building which,\nthe agency stop paying on after the secure juvenile justice\nprogram closed down. He said the agency is trying to sell or\nmade other arrangements for that building. He said, they have had\ndifferent companies from various states (Kentucky, Ohio, etc.) to\nlook at the building, but the companies either pulled out or nothing\ncame to be.\nCOO 3 reported the 9.4-million-dollar debt this special\ninvestigation alleges, is really more like 7 million dollars. He\nreported of that total, 3 million is owed to one lender, Comerica-\nBank; and that will be paid off in March or May of this year (2023).\nHe advised they could not pay off early-because that would incur\npenalties. He reported with respect to the loan for the WSTC\nbuilding, that project was a community venture. He reported the\nparties, bonds, changed over the year, but the facility was a joint\nventure built for MDHHS, etc. He reported due to the Department\nbeing a part of the team, Wolverine was trying to work things out\nrelated to that building. He reported, losses, such as inequities in\nservices cost (especially during COVID); a lack of payment when\nchildren go home; CWTI (Child Welfare Training institute) not\n4",
    "being paid for; all contributed to that debt. He reported there had\nbeen an agreement to not do anything with the WSTC building for\nfive years; and Wolverine offered it up as a possible resource for\nthe Department. For example, possibly converting the WSTC\nbuilding over to some other program for children, such as a\nresidential shelter; but apparently there are no fees for such. He\nsaid the agency has made a verbal commitment to the contract\npiece related to this WSTC property, but things have not been\nworking out.\nCOO 3 reported that what’s on paper related to the alleged 9.4-\nmillion-dollar debt also does not take into account other funds\ncoming into the agency. Such as 3.4 million dollars that the\nDepartment sent; over 2 million dollars that will be forth coming\nrelated to employment retention that is a part of their 2–3-year\noperational cost; and the Department’s daily rate increases.\nAdditionally, COO 3 reported what should be taken into account\nby DCWL is that the agency made foster parent/board and care\npayments regardless as to whether State checks came to the\nagency timely. He reiterated, Wolverine pays its foster care\nproviders; payments from the State for these services go directly\nto the providers, not an agency accounts. He further reported a\ndesire for the State to recognize the services costs that are\nconnected to issues pertaining to agencies’ finances/debts. He\nreported investigations like this one seem to serve to penalize the\nagency over some financial woes; and that there really should be\nsome kind of financial protections coming from the Department.\nHe acknowledged it’s true that the agency’s foster program has to\nsupport other programs, is paying for other agency costs, but\nWolverine is not going into bankruptcy. And notwithstanding the\nagency electing to allow the loan for the WSTC building to default,\nthe agency’s other debts, leases are being taken care of. He\nreported with respect to the actual 7-million-dollar debt owed on\nthe WSTC loan, Wolverine has frequent contact/ ongoing\ncommunications with the lender, as they work towards a mutual\nsolutions; whether that’s a sale or new usage of that the building.\nCOO 3 reported they are following the financial guidance of their\nlegal advisors, but the objective is to resolve the debt. This has\nbeen reported to many DHHS directors, legislators, courts,\nbusiness groups etc. He said, the agency has and will continue to\nwork with interested parties who explore that property. That\nWolverine’s efforts related to that debt is not preventing them from\ndoing business, or paying other lenders, as they, as a nonprofit,\nare navigating the financial difficulties of a pandemic, and the\nchanges in the array in services.\n5",
    "Administrator 2\nI spoke with Administrator 2, the Executive Director of Community-\nBased Programs and current chief administrator for this license,\nby telephone on 4/19/2023. Administrator 2 reported various\nstatements as reported by COO 3 or as represented in documents\nprovided by Administrator 4. These being that the agency is\npaying its bills, as well as caregivers and staff. The reported 9.4-\nmillion-dollar debt referenced in the complaint is by way of two\nlenders. The smaller loan is via Comerica Bank. Administrator 2\nbelieved the balance on that loan is $58,762.00, which will be paid\noff by 5/1/2023. She reported Administrator 4 could better\naddress this matter. The larger loan is by way of Investco, the\ncompany that holds the mortgage on the WSTC building that went\ninto default in 2021. The current balance on that loan was\n$6,078,110 and Wolverine’s legal fiscal team is working with\nInvestco to resolve that matter.\nAdministrator 4\nOn 4/24/2023, I interviewed Administrator 4, Wolverine’s Lead\nFinancial Controller. Administrator 4 had also provided me prior\nemail documents as indicated in the methodology section of this\nreport. The documents related to the agency’s loan payments,\nstaff and caregiver payments, and utilities and various agency\nbuildings’ lease payments. Administrator 4 clarified some reporting\nby Administrator 2 and affirmed some reporting by COO 3. Those\nbeing that the agency is paying its financial obligations and is not\nstruggling to meet those obligations. Administrator 4 reported\nthat all of Wolverine’s Community Based Program buildings are\nleases. These offices are located in Warren, Flint, Bloomfield, and\nTaylor Michigan respectively. The leases’ origination dates and\nmonthly lease payment amounts are as follow:\nLease Holder Lease date Payment amount\nLSPV Cornerstone- LLC 1/17/2017 $5,103.28\nFlint, MI\nF & M Company LLC- 8/1/2017 $7,094.62\nWarren, MI\n20300Superior- Taylor, 3/17/2016 $22,576.00\nMI\nManabal Eastwood- 9/15/2015 $5, 423. 00\nBloomfield, MI\nUtilities are paid directly to the Leaser for Taylor. There were also\nbeing paid that way for the Bloomfield office. The Bloomfield lease\nended 3/31/2023; the agency did not renew it. That office was\nrarely used by staff; and staff now utilize the Flint office, if needed.\n6",
    "Administrator 4 provided me a payment history for leases and\nutilities from 10/01/2020 to March 2023. Payments were\ndocumented as consistent and timely; no concerns were noted or\nindicated.\nAdministrator 4 reported the agency has had several loans\nthrough the years. The agency has had three major loans with\nComerica Bank in the last few years. One loan related to a\n$350,000 loan the agency took out in December of 2017 for wiring\nand development on various community-based program offices.\nThis loan was paid off in November of 2022. Documentation from\nAdministrator 4 showed this loan listed on Comerica Bank notices\nas Note # 000-00-0013-3. As of a 11/30/2022 Comerica Bank\nLoan payment notice, $55.69 for interest was listed on that\naccount.\nThe other two Comerica Bank loans relate to completion of a gym\nand other constructions or improvements on Wolverine’s Vassar\nCampus (another CCI licensed program). The smaller of these\ntwo loans was paid off on 4/10/2023. Administrator 4 provided me\na copy of the Comerica Bank statement showing that loan’s pay\noff. A 4/10/2023 Comerica statement showed a $18, 244.13\nprincipal balance; $26.07 interest balance, and indicated a\n$18,270.20 loan pay off (Comerica Loan Detroit Reference#\n98953387870- Note # 000-00-003-4). The second of these two\nloans was refinanced a couple of years ago. The amount was $3.\n3 million dollars; and the current balance as of 4/11/2023 is\n$2,415,960.80(Note # 000-0015-8). This balance came to be after\nWolverine made an additional payment on 04/11/2023 of\n$6,700.00, which reduces the principal balance to the\n2,415,960.80 amount. Administrator 4 reported the monthly\npayment on this loan is $41,400 monthly, plus interest. The\nagency is current on this account, makes these payment timely\nand has been paying $25,000 monthly on the principal.\nAs for a $58,762.00 amount seen/ referenced earlier in this report\nwith Administrator 2, this was a total amount owed/ paid toward\nboth of the Comerica Bank loans referenced above. A 3/31/2023\nWolverine automatic loan payment notice received from\nAdministrator 4 showed that amount to be the combined\ndue/payment related to $44,457.64 due for the principal and\n$16,224.86 due for the interest on both Comerica Bank loans at\nthat time. Administrator 4 reported as of 4/11/2023 Wolverine’s\nonly loan with Comerica Bank is the one with the balance of\n2,415,960 (Note # 000-0015-8).\n7",
    "Administrator 4 affirmed what was reported by COO 3 and\nAdministrator 2 as to the loan owed by Wolverine pertaining to the\nWSTC building. That loan which had originated via Well-Fargo, is\nthe Investco lender account. It has a debt of $6,078,110 plus\ninterest. Administrator 4 advised that Wolverine defaulted on\nthat loan on 2/28/2021, after the WSTC facility closed, Wolverine\nnot having revenue to pay it. She also affirmed reports that the\nagency was looking to sell the property; is in constant contact with\nthe lender; and people who may be looking to purchase it. She\nsaid, the agency had a company from out of state looking at the\nWSTC building as recent as March 2023.\nEmployee Interviews\nOn 4/17/2023 I interviewed seven of the agency employees, which\nended up consisting of staff from three of its four listed office sites.\nThe employees’ employment time with the agency ranged from\nfour months to eight years. Each of these employees reporting\nwas consist with those of caregivers with respect to them always\nbeen paid timely and consistently. Each of these employees\nreported receiving twice monthly payments by way of direct\ndeposit. Neither of these employees had experienced a late\npayment or nonreceipt of a payment. All reported this agency as\na positive agency to work for, and one they would recommend.\nFoster Care Providers Interviews\nStarting on 4/17/2023 and ending on 4/18/2023 I interviewed nine\nof the agency’s foster care caregivers by telephone. Five of\nthese caregivers were foster parents and four were unlicensed\nrelatives. I spoke with four licensed foster parents on 4/17/2023;\nand a fifth licensed foster parent on 4/18/2023. The respective\ncaregiver’s length of time with the agency ranged from one year to\nfive years. With the exception of a couple of the caregivers\nreporting there being a delay in them receiving an initial board and\ncare payment (that they later received back payments of; and\nwhich they did not think was due to any fault of the agency’s), all\nof the caregivers reported timely and consistent twice monthly\nboard and care payments from the agency. Many of these\nproviders did not know whether those payments were accurate,\nbut all reported the amounts seemed correct, and came regularly,\neither by direct deposit or check.\nDocument Review:\nA January 11, 2023, Memorandum from MDHHS’s Audit and\nReview Section (ARS) which indicated Wolverine Human Services\nper fiscal year ending 9/30/2021:\n8",
    "• Were found to have several financial risk factors.\n• During fiscal year ended 9/30/2021, MDHHS provided the\nagency: Foster care, State payments for 12, 401,762.\n• The program areas that contract with Wolverine Human\nServices should be aware of the following information noted\nin the audit report:\n➢ Working Capital-Wolverine Human Services has\nnegative working capital of $3,922,621 for 2021.\nWorking capital is a common measure of an\nagency’s liquidity. Negative working capital generally\nindicates an agency’s inability to pay off its short-\nterm liabilities if they came due immediately.\n➢ Current Ratio-Wolverine Human Services has a\ncurrent Ratio of 0.63.1. Current ratio tests liquidity by\nderiving the proportion of current assets available to\ncover current liabilities. The higher the current ratio,\nthe more capable the agency is of paying its\nobligations. A ratio under 1% suggests that the\nagency could be unable to pay off its obligations if\nthey came due at that point.\n➢ The audit report included relevant notes to the\nfinancial statements. Notes 5 and 12 in the 2021\nFinancial Statement are attached.\n➢ Note number 5 details that the agency defaulted on\na semi-annual payment for a Long-Term note. This\nresulted in all Long-Term debt converting to current\ndebt. Current Debt due is $9,404,704.\n➢ Note Number 12 details the Going Concern\nConsideration. This note quantifies that without the\nPPP (Paycheck Protection Program)proceeds, State\nof Michigan grant, and ERC(Employee Retention\nCredit) monies Wolverines Human Services current\nyear loss would have been approximately\n($923,000). Those were all one-time funds, and the\nnote states those factors raise substantial doubt\nabout the Organization’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\n• The ARS will continue to monitor the agency and provide\nupdates, as deemed necessary.\n• Note 5 titled Note Payable and Long-Tern Debt from\nWolverine Human Services 9/30/2021 Financial Statement.\nThis note indicated Long-term debt consists of:\n9",
    "Mortgage payable-bank, 5.85% interest $6,078,110\nwith semi-annual of $568,434 through\nAugust 2027.\nMortgage payable-bank 2.655% interest $2,886,242\nwith monthly payments of approximately\n$30,100 through February 2030\nMortgage payable-bank 5.62% interest $ 344, 793\nwith monthly payments of $19,200\nthrough May 2023.\nNote payable-bank, 5.85% interest with $95,559\nmonthly payments of $6,755 through\nOctober 2022\n$9, 404,704\nLess current portion $9,404,704\nTotal long-term debt $ -\n• As a result of not paying the semi-annual payments of\n$568,434, the Organization is in violations of certain\ncovenants. Accordingly, all long-term borrowings are due\ncurrently.\nNote 12 titled Going on Concern Consideration from Wolverine\nHuman Services 9/30/2021 Financial Statement. This note\nindicated:\n• During the year, the Organization closed its secure\ntreatment facility and is in default on that corresponding\ndebt of approximately $6.1 million. Other debts of\napproximately $3.3 million is in violation of certain loan\nagreements but is being serviced. Revenues decreased by\nover 50% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Without the PPP\nproceeds, $2,077,312, State grant, and the recoverable\nERC monies, the current year loss would have\napproximated $923,000. Accordingly, management had\ndetermined these factors raise substantial doubt about the\nOrganization’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n• Subsequent to the year end, the Organization was awarded\na $3,5 million sustainability payment from the State of\nMichigan, received approval for certain rate per diem\nincreases, and submitted for a $1.8 million refund as part of\nthe ERC payroll tax credit.\n• Management believes with the $3.5 million sustainability\npayment from the State of Michigan, in September 2022,\ncertain contractual per diem increases, adjusting the labor\nlevels to meet the client count, and potentially selling the\nsecure treatment facility, the Organization can achieve a\nsustainable economic level.\n10",
    "• Management has concluded based on those factors the\nOrganization should be able to continue as a going\nconcern. The financial statement does not include any\nadjustments that might be necessary should the\nOrganization not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWolverine Human Service’s Financial Statement for year ended\n9/30/2020 which showed:\n• Accommodations made, PPP loans, the agency had a\n$1,000,000 available line of credit, principal payment on an\napproximate $4.156 million long-term debt was deferred for\n90 days. No financial covenants were violated during the\nyear.\n• The compensation committee determined discretionary\nfunding of various insurance and mutual fund products to\nsatisfy the future obligation. During that current year the net\nreserve decreased by approximately $390,000\n• At 9/30/2020, the plan assets approximated $6.908 million,\nand the estimated liability approximated $7, 054 million.\nComerica Bank loan payment notices: Advice of automatic loan\npayments from 9/1/2021 to 4/3/2023 showing:\n• In 2021 three notes/ accounts were being paid.\n• The documents showed the principal balance, interest\nrates, and amounts due. Reductions were seen on the\nnotices through the periods, as a result of the agency’s\npayments on the principal and interest.\n• As of 11/30/2022 loan note 000-00-00013- an interest due\nof $55.69 was indicated. The loan was reported paid off.\n• As of 3/31/2023 only loan note-000-00-0003-4 and note\n000-00-0015-8 are listed on the payment notice.\n• As of 4/11/2023 loan note 000-00-0003-4 had a zero\nbalance; it was paid off.\n• As of 4/11/2023 loan note 000-00-0015-8, had a balance of\n2,415,960.80.\nA Wolverine Human Services ledgers showing:\n• Lease payments, gas, electric payment for Warren, Taylor,\nBloomfield, Flint offices 10/1/2020- 3/17/2023 as noted for\nthe respective office.\nWolverine’s CPA- CM-465 form for 10/1/2020 to 9/30/2021\ncompleted 12/31/2021 for contract number MA 2100809(adoption)\nand MA1801004(foster care) showing:\n11",
    "• The CPA received adoption revenues of $534,896.00;\nfoster care funds of $3,449,907.20, for a total revenue of\n$3,984,803.20.\n• MDHHS board and care to foster parents was $1,471,913.\n67 with that, mileage and other specific foster care\nfundings totaling $1,682,479.00 for a total revenue of\n$5,667, 282.20.\n• Direct expenses paid by the CPA for salaries, fringe\nbenefits, operating cost, and foster care board payment\nexpenses was $5,394,204.85 with a revenue and expense\ndifference of $273,077.35.\nAnalysis The Organization’s larger outstanding debt of $ 6,078,110.37 and\nsecondary debt of $ 2,415,960.80 respectively are loans which\noriginated on residential facilities/CCI licenses outside of this\nCPA’s specific license. The larger debt has been in default since\nFebruary 2021, after the Organization’s WSTC facility closed. The\nagency maintains communication with that lender; and continues\nefforts to either sell this property or develop a partnership to\ndevelop another program for the building, which ever proves\nviable and productive. The smaller debt relates to the\nOrganization’s Vassar residential facility, and the agency\ncontinues to make monthly payment toward this debt.\nNotwithstanding these debts, the agency/this CPA continues to\nreceive various foster care and other revenues and pays it\nemployees, caregivers and other financial obligations. There is\nnot clear evidence that the agency is financially unstable and\nunable to pay or met its ongoing obligations.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the agency’s current licensing status is recommended.\n______________________________________ May 6, 2023\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n12",
