Both Special evaluation reports were completed thoroughly and included\nappropriate recommendations and CAPs based on the incidents and findings.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\n5",
    "The one CAP submitted during the period under review was submitted in response\nto the 2024 renewal inspection report dated 3/7/2024 and was approved on\n3/27/2024. That CAP addressed 12 violations, two of which were policy violations\n(PATP signatures & and FTMs) and one of which was a PA 116 violation\n(Confidentiality). Of the remaining nine violations, the agency has achieved and\nmaintained compliance. The one violation repeated this year was related to face-\nto-face visits with Independent Living youth is the youth's place of residence. The\nviolation was also present during the 2023 inspection and will require analysis as\nto why prior CAPs were not effective.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator report was completed on 2/24/25 and identified areas in\nwhich the agency had barriers to maintaining compliance. The first was\nmedical/dental exams and the barriers identified were caregiver failure to\ncommunicate the need to change appointments, lack of local providers, limited\nregional options, and older youth refusal. Barriers to maintaining placements for\nyouth with challenging behaviors were lack of local mental health providers, lack of\nproviders familiar with trauma-based therapy models, lack of respite providers,\nolder youths' unwillingness to comply with services, and limited number of homes\nwilling to accept older youths. Barriers to parental involvement included limited\npublic transportation options, high percentage of substance abuse, lack of access\nto affordable and stable housing, criminal activity, and mental health concerns.\nBarriers to sibling visits included distance between placements, and schedule\ncoordination for large sibling groups. Additionally, three workers left during the\nperiod under review. The Quality Assurance Analyst position was also vacant for a\nperiod of time during the period under review which led to a decline in tracking and\nauditing until that position was filled. The agency has hired two new workers and a\nsocial service aide. There has been an increase in compliance with worker-child\nvisits, worker parent visits, and service plan timeliness\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed reported receiving supportive supervision\nthroughout the year during which some workers left the agency and some were on\nmedical or parental leave. They reported utilizing tracking methods implemented\nafter previous inspection CAPs which have been helpful maintaining compliance.\nNo concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe office appeared to have adequate space and equipment to provide for the\ndelivery of foster home certification, foster care, and independent living services.\nFiles are stored in a secured file area with locked cabinets containing closed\nadoption files.\n6",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nFebruary 28, 2025\n_______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 28, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
