The original allegation involved a\nyouth suffering a broken arm and claiming it occurred when pushed to the ground by\na staff. Upon the investigation, it was discovered the staff had supervision of this\nyouth and had engaged in disciplining the youth rather than using appropriate\nbehavior management techniques. Additional findings were uncovered when it was\nlearned two staff were not following facility policy when they failed to follow the safety\nseparation procedure, report a relationship between them, and used their personal\nphones while supervising youth. The findings resulted in the facility providing an\napproved corrective action plan (CAP) on 8/24/2022.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans.\nThe findings of Special Investigation 2022C0214009 resulted in the facility providing\nan approved corrective action plan (CAP) on 8/24/2022.
