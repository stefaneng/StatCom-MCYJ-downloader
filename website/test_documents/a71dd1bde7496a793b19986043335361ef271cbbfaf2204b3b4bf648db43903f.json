She reported on August\n25, 2025, she received a call from Relative that Youth A was\ncurrently at her home, and Case Manager explained to Relative\nthat Youth A was discharged from their program.

She reported when she sent\nthe incident report, she also sent the information about the five-\nday bed hold, and if he was not to return within those five days, he\nwould then be discharged from the program. Administrator 1\nreported that since Youth A did not fully return within those five\ndays, he was discharged from the program. She reported an email\nwas sent out on the morning of August 24, 2025, stating Youth A\nwas discharged. Administrator 1 reported the relative did contact\nCase Manager about Youth A’s whereabouts, and since Youth A\nwas discharged, Case Manager called Foster Care Worker to\nnotify her. Consultant asked Administrator 1 if she was aware that,\nwithin state licensing rules, when a youth is considered AWOL,\nthe facility needs to report immediately to law enforcement,\nguardian, foster care team, and state licensing, and she reported\nshe was not aware that it needed to be immediately reported to\nstate licensing and the foster care team. Administrator 1 thought\nshe had 24 hours from the incident to report.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nAugust 28, 2025.

Administrator 3\nreported staff followed all the policies and procedures as it came\nto reporting Youth A being AWOL, communicating with Foster\nCare Worker, and discharging Youth A from their program. She\nreported she was not aware that the rule had changed to have to\nreport to all parties about an AWOL youth immediately.\nAdministrator 3 reported there is also no definition of immediately\nin the rule set, so within her interpretation, then within 24 hours\nwould be appropriate for state licensing and the foster care team\n4",
    "to receive notification, as long as law enforcement and the\nNational Center for Exploited Children Hotline were contacted\nimmediately to assist with making sure this youth is safe. She\nreported this policy has been reviewed and approved by state\nlicensing.
