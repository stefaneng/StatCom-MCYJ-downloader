CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nThe agency is asked to ensure accuracy of their lists and to ensure that\ninformation is correct prior to submitting for the inspection.\n8",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period. The agency completed a thorough special evaluation of the foster\nhome and cited the violation appropriately. A corrective action plan was\nimplemented related to the violation. It appears the agency adequately addressed\nthe situation.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. This corrective action plan, dated\n11/18/19, was submitted in response to special investigation report 2019C0207042,\ndated 11/05/19. The agency was cited for R 325 license recommendation as they\nnoted non-compliances related to safety but did not ensure the CAP addressed the\nsafety issues. This issue did not present itself again in this review among the special\nevaluation and the reevaluations reviewed, therefore, it appears the agency is\nfollowing their CAP.\nThere are 13 violations in this inspection report compared to 25 in the last. This\nshows significant improvement and compliance with the previous CAP. There are 8\nrepeat violations noted in this report for which the agency needs to focus on to\nensure they bring those areas into compliance.\nThe field analyst report noted no safety concerns, therefore, no follow up was\nrequired.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\nNovember 18, 2020\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n9",
