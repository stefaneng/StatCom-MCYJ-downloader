Two of 16 Service Plans/PATPs\nreviewed were not uploaded. A Service Plan/PATP dated July 27, 2022, was not\nuploaded.

A second FTM dated July 22, 2022, did not have a\nc ompleted DHHS-1105.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nTechnical assistance was provided regarding youth with YAVFC status who are\nplaced in an independent living placement. Discussion involved YAVFC youth, when\nliving in an independent living arrangement such as a college dorm or an apartment,\nare then considered to be in independent living and therefore independent living rules\napply. The independent living rules do not apply to YAVFC youth living with a relative,\nin a foster home, or in a CCI.\nV. CONSULTATION\nConsultation was not requested or provided at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nAn approved corrective action plan was received on September 29, 2021, in\nresponse to rule violations established during the renewal inspection completed on\nAugust 31, 2021. The current inspection did not establish any repeat violations\nindicating that the agency CAP was sucessful in preventing repeat vioplations. There\nwere no complaints against the agency during the licensing period.\nChief Administrators Assessment:\nThe Chief Administrators assessment was reviewed and was found to be thorough.\nThe assessment identified systemic factors that impacted the agency in the past\nyear. They are as follows: The agency was short staffed for a period of time which\nposed challenges for the foster care team. The report also stated that the ongoing\neffects of the COVID pandemic has made it difficult to obtain dental appointments as\ndental offices are scheduling appointments very far in advance. Travel time to make\nface-to-face visits with foster children also is a challenge but the report states\ncompliance with face-to-face visits is very high. The report further indicates that\nworker meetings with parents can be a challenge at times due to an unwilling or non-\nparticipatory parent. The assessment also addressed rule violations established\nduring the renewal inspection in 2021 and the agency efforts to prevent future\nviolations.\n4",
    "Interviews:\nStaff reported that they like working for the agency and feel they have a supportive\nteam. Staff stated further that their supervisor as well as the Chief Administrator are\nknowledgeable and supportive. Staff reported that inadequate staffing has presented\nchallenges at times however the team comes together to overcome obstacles.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe Field Analyst identified two safety alerts while visiting agency homes.\nThey are as follows:\nSafety Alert #1. This safety alert was generated on August 17, 2022, and involved\nbows and arrows which were not stored securely and also guns and ammunition that\nwere not kept locked in separate locations. The agency responded and resolution\nwas obtained on August 18, 2022. Photos were provided and accompanied the\nresolution.\nSafety Alert #2. This safety alert was generated on August 15, 2022, and involved\nthe lack of an installed carbon monoxide detector in the foster home. Resolution was\nachieved on August 16, 2022. A photo of the installed detector was provided.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\nJanuary 9, 2023\n______________________________________\nDouglas W Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 20, 2023\n______________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n5"
