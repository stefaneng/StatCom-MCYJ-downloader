    "and Staff 3 cleared out Youth A’s bedroom as Youth A tried to\ngrab her items and bite staff. Supervisor 1 and Staff 3 physically\nmanaged Youth A inside her bedroom and released her when she\nmaneuvered to the ground. Youth A de-escalated and processed\nthe incident with Staff 6. Supervisor 1 placed Youth A on close\nobservation until she could meet with Therapist.\nStaff 1 completed a body chart of Youth A on 02/15/2025. It states\nYouth A does not have new marks or bruises on her body.\nVista Maria’s behavior management policy states “To maintain a\nsafe environment for all Vista Maria clients and staff, behavior\nmanagement interventions are only used when a client presents a\ndanger to self or others. These interventions should only be used\nwhen all other less restrictive behavior management interventions\n(i.e., verbal de-escalation, therapeutic interventions) have been\nexplored.”\nVista Maria utilizes Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) – Nonviolent\nCrisis Prevention Intervention. Staff physically involved with Youth\nA in this investigation and their last CPI training in relation to the\ndate of this incident are listed below.\nSupervisor 1 completed CPI training on 03/25/2024.\nSupervisor 2 completed CPI training on 11/07/2024.\nStaff 1 completed CPI training on 02/15/2024.\nStaff 3 completed CPI training on 03/27/2024.\nTour\nUpon entering Myriam Hall there are offices to the left and right of\nthe hallway in the foyer area. Moving forward is an open area that\nserves as a multipurpose common area. This common area is\nfurnished with a desk, couches and a television. The dining room\nis to the left of the common area with three circular tables and\nchairs. A full kitchen and a storage room adjoins the dining room\nto the left when facing the dining room from the multipurpose\ncommon area. In the back right corner of the common area is a\nmedia room. The top half of the media room walls facing the\ncommon area are made of rectangular windows. Next to the\nmedia room is a walkway leading to the bedroom hallway. Youth\nbedrooms, youth bathrooms and a staff office line the bedroom\nhallway.\n8",
    "Analysis The agency is found in compliance because interviews and video\nreview do not support the allegation that Youth A was pushed to\nthe ground causing the bruise to her left thigh and left forearm.\nVideo footage does not capture what occurred inside of Youth A’s\nbedroom. It cannot be determined in this investigation when or\nhow Youth A obtained the bruises.\nThis incident quickly escalated from a staffing issue to monitor\nYouth A in her bedroom to Youth A not being able to self-regulate\nand manage her frustration and behavior. There was no inclination\nthat not allowing Youth A to go to her bedroom would unfold as it\ndid. The amount of time it took to resolve this and the number of\nstaff that responded would have allowed Youth A to be monitored\nby staff in her bedroom. Thus, Youth A is to work on coping skills,\nimpulse control and building relationships.\nTechnical Assistance\nListed below are suggestions for staff that may have deterred this\nincident from progressing.\n1) Lock youth bedroom doors when youth is not in their bedroom\nto prevent unauthorized access.\n2) Unlock the bedroom door for youth when youth returns to\nbaseline.\n3) Close and lock youth bedroom without the youth inside if\npersonal items need to be removed. Clear the bedroom of\npersonal belongings when youth is not present.\n4) Supervisor could have monitored youth in the bedroom hallway\nand reset limits with youth e.g. allowing youth 15 minutes in\nbedroom before going to the media room or common area if\nstaffing needs remain.\n5) Offer youth to have an item or two items from her bedroom for\nuse in the media room or common area.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n9",
