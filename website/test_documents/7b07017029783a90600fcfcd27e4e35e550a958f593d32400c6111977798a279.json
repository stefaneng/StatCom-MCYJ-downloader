    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On an unknown date, youth woke up in the middle of the night and\nhad to use the restroom. He called for staff and knocked on his\ndoor, but nobody let him out to use the restroom. He urinated in\nhis clothes and still nobody came to let him out, so he changed his\nclothes and went back to sleep. On another occasion, youth had\nto use the restroom and was not let out of his room. An unknown\nstaff told him several times that he was going to come get him, but\nthe staff did not come get him. It is assumed that the staff left.\nEventually another staff member came and let youth out to use\nthe bathroom. Youth was about to defecate on the floor when that\nstaff came to help. It is unknown how long he had to wait for\nassistance.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on February 21,\n2024. Complainant said Youth A has a history of wetting the bed\nand struggles with encopresis at times which may have been a\nfactor in these incidents.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nFebruary 22, 2024. Youth A said he woke up in the middle of the\nnight and needed to urinate so knocked two different times on his\ndoor and no staff responded. He urinated in his clothing, changed\nhis clothes and went back to bed. Youth A said he does not\nremember when it happened, if it was a school night, or what staff\nwas working the night it occurred. Youth A said a few weeks ago\nhe got up for the day by Staff 1 and got ready for school and was\nplaced back in his bedroom by Staff 1. Youth A said he needed to\nuse the restroom so he began to knock on the door and Staff 2\ncame and let him out to use the bathroom. Youth A said he\nbelieves he was in his room for less than ten minutes. Youth A\nsaid he is locked in his bedroom every night and if he asks to\nspend time alone in his room, but no other time throughout the\nday. Youth A said these are the only incidents of him needing to\nuse the bathroom while locked in his bedroom.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nFebruary 22, 2024. Youth B said he is locked in his bedroom at\nnight and no other time throughout the day. Youth B said when he\n2",
    "is in his room and needs to be let out to use the bathroom he\nknocks, and staff allows him out. Youth B denied ever having a\ntime when he was not allowed out to use the bathroom. Youth B\nsaid a few weeks ago Staff 1 got all the youth out of rooms and\nready for the day and then put them back in their bedrooms for a\nshort time to go talk to the other staff and then the “day staff” let\nthem out of their rooms. Youth B was not able to recall how long\nhe was in his room or which staff got him back out of his room.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on March 5, 2024. Staff 1\nsaid he was previously employed at Osceola Youth Center and his\nlast day was February 12, 2024. Staff 1 said he worked third shift\nand was supposed to work from 11pm until 7am, noting that he\nnever got out on time and was frequently made to stay over for an\nhour or more to wait for the next shift. Staff 1 said Staff 2 was in\ncharge of the schedule and would not have staff schedule or have\nthem coming into work after 7am. Staff 1 said the morning of\nFebruary 12, 2024, he received a text message at 7:30am from\nStaff 2, asking him to bring items from detention to the shelter unit.\nStaff 1 said he put the youth in their rooms and completed the task\nand when he was in the shelter unit it was decided by Staff 3 that\nStaff 1 would leave, and Staff 3 would remain at the facility until\nthe first shift staff arrived. Staff 1 said he then clocked out and left\nfor the day. Staff 1 said staff for first shift would have a “shift brief”\neach morning but he never locked the youth in their rooms for this\nshift brief and he would remain on the unit until another staff\narrived. Staff 1 noted he only worked Friday, Saturday and Sunday\nnights and so was unaware if things were different on weekday\nshifts. Staff 1 said Youth A never had a situation where he was\nlocked in his room and not allowed out to use the bathroom on\nany of his shifts. Staff 1 said he was made aware that Youth A\ndoes wet the bed however he said that never occurred on any of\nhis shifts.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face on February 27, 2024.\nStaff 2 said she arrived on February 12, 2024, and saw Staff 1\ngetting into his car at 7:41am. Staff 2 said when she entered the\nbuilding she was checking the schedule and realized that Staff 1\nwas supposed to stay over. She went into the detention hallway at\n7:45am and saw the youth were in their rooms, heard Youth A\nknocking to get out and use the bathroom, and let all the youth out\nto finish getting ready for the day. Staff 2 said Staff 1 had told\nanother staff he needed to leave at 7:30am that day, so he left\nwithout supervisor notification or permission. Staff 2 said youth\ntypically are awoken at 6:45am and begin to get ready for the day.\nStaff 2 said at times the youth are placed back in their rooms for\n3",
    "shift change and other times the staff just overlap on the unit\nquickly and the youth are never put back in their bedrooms.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via telephone on March 15, 2024. Staff\n3 said he was working third shift on the shelter unit on February\n12, 2024. Staff 3 said Staff 1 did come over to the shelter unit in\nthe morning however there was not a conversation about who was\ngoing to stay or leave. Staff 3 said Staff 1 left the shelter unit and\nafter a few minutes he heard some knocking on the detention unit\nso went to check and see what was happening. Staff 2 was on the\nunit letting the youth out of their rooms and asked him to stay until\nthe first shift staff arrived, which he did. Staff 3 said there is a “shift\nbriefing” between each shift which normally takes place between\nthe staff on the unit.\nDirector was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on March\n7, 2024. Director said the program does a shift briefing between\nevery shift and attempts to complete the briefing without locking\nthe detention youth in their bedrooms. Director said placing the\ndetention youth in their bedrooms for shift change is a tool staff\nare aware of, but it is not consistently used or needed depending\non the day.\nVideo Review:\nVideo footage of February 12, 2024, detention hallway was\nreviewed on February 27, 2024. Staff 1 has the youth out of\nrooms getting ready for the day at 6:59am. Staff 1 is seen putting\nthe youth back in their rooms at 7:40am and completing a check.\nStaff 3 is then seen in the hallway with all of the youth at 7:47am.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: There was one disciplinary action\ndated February 5, 2024, for being disrespectful to\nadministration showing a lack of professionalism. Staff 1\nwas trained on Youth Supervision, Movement, and Checks\non October 24, 2023.\n• Youth Opportunity Youth Supervision, Movement and\nChecks Policy was reviewed. The policy outlines the\nexpectations for staff supervision of youth including\nsleeping hours and the requirement to check the youth “at\nleast every ten minutes”.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with Program Statement. The\nstaff followed the facility guidelines and procedures to check on\nyouth not to exceed ten-minute intervals. The youth was placed in\nhis room for a shift change which is allowed per the rules and was\n4",
    "checked on prior to the ten-minute expectation and allowed out of\nhis room to use the bathroom. There is no evidence that staff did\nnot allow the youth out of his room to use the bathroom.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n______________________________________March 18, 2024\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 19, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
