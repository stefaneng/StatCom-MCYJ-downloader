Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance with all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a MDHHS Contract violation. Please\nnote that there are additional MDHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not\nbe included in section 1. The facility is in compliance with all additional MDHHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nFOM 722-06B Family Team Meeting\n(Page 5) FTMs must occur within the required time frames as\noutlined… Updated Case Plan (USP) - within 30 calendar days\nbefore the case plan due date.\n4",
    "(Page 16) Following the FTM, the caseworker is responsible for\nthe following:  Completing the DHS-1105, Family Team\nMeeting Report.  Providing the DHS-1105, Family Team\nMeeting Report, to all participants (in person and by phone),\nlegal parents, and casework supervisor. These documents must\nalso be uploaded into MISACWIS.\n(Page 5) Two of eight foster care files did not have FTMs completed 30 days prior to\ncompleting an updated service plan.\n(Page 16) Four of eight foster care files did not have an 1105 completed to\ndocument an FTM as required. Nor was an 1105 provided to FTM participants.\nFOM 722-08D Treatment plan\nPage 10\nThe caseworker must obtain signatures from all applicable\nindividuals and upload the signatures pages into the electronic\ncase record within 30 days of the report date.\nFour of eight foster care files held late or missing PATP signatures.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED (previously cited as CI 17-099)\n7/16/21 INTERIM, CAP approved 7/16/20.\nFOM 722-08 Case service plans- overview, types, and timeframes\nThe supervisor must approve all case service plans within 14\ndays of the end of the report period.\nTwo of eight foster care files each held one service plan that was not approved\nwithin the required timeframe.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED (previously cited as FOM 722-09)\n7/16/20 INTERIM, CAP approved 7/16/20\nFOM 801-03 Medical passport\nPage 2-3\nAll medical information within the medical passport must be\ncurrent and updated at least quarterly to reflect the child's\ncurrent and complete health information.\nReceipt of the medical passport by the above listed parties is\ndocumented in MiSACWIS by uploading the signed and dated\nsignature page into the Health Profile section.\nTwo of eight foster care files did not have quarterly updated medical passports\ncompleted or provided to case participants as required.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED (previously cited as FOM 801)\n5/5/21 RENEWAL, CAP approved 5/11/21\n5",
    "7/16/20 INTERIM, CAP approved 7/16/20\nFOM 722-08E Foster care/juvenile justice action summary\nPage 6\nWithin three business days of foster care or juvenile justice\nprogram or case closure, the caseworker must document...\nOne of eight closed foster care cases did not have a closing summary completed\nwithin the required timeframe.\nFOM 722-06H Case contacts\nPage 5\nThe primary caseworker must have face-to-face contact with\neach child as indicated below...\nThe first face-to-face contact must take place within five\nbusiness days of the date of removal or placement change.\nOne of eight foster care cases did not make face to face contact within five days of\nthe child entering care.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Some licensing renewal letters indicated the family must complete an\napplication but did not indicate the application was provided. There must be\ndocumentation in the file to show the date the application was provided in\norder to determine the rule requirement was met.\n Case records, including USPs and PATPs, must clearly indicate when a\nparent is non-participating.\n Borrowed Bed case files had a coversheet to document when items were\nreceived, including endorsement of the reports received at the beginning of\nthe agreement. However, the agency should update the form to document\nendorsement of subsequent reports received for the duration of the borrowed\nbed agreement.\n DHHS-69’s must be completed within 3 days of case closure. However, if the\nwritten closing court order is not immediately received, it is acceptable for the\nagency to complete the DHHS-69 within 3 days of receiving the written court\norder.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n6",
    " Rule 327(6c) requires the agency to provide a copy of a special evaluation\nreport to the caseworker for any children in the foster home. Although not\nspecified in the rule, the agency was advised it would be best practice to\nprovide this report to the worker for any children that were in the home at the\nbeginning of the evaluation but moved before it was completed. Especially if\nthe findings impact the ongoing care of the child.\n During the review it was observed some foster parents first aid/CPR was near\nexpiration, but an annual/renewal evaluation would not occur for several\nmonths later. The agency was advised first aid/CPR dates should be tracked\noutside of annual/renewal reviews, to ensure they do not expire before the\nnext annual evaluation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP, approved 5/22/21, was submitted as a result of the 5/5/21 renewal\nevaluation. During this review only one repeat violation regarding Medical Passports\nwas found. The agency has successfully implemented the CAP and shown\nimprovement in several areas. While there are nine violations cited in this review, the\noccurrence of each violation was small.\nChief Administrator Assessment(CAA)\nThe CAA was reviewed and discussed during the entrance meeting on 4/18/22. The\nChief Adminstrator (CA) identified prior violations regarding foster parent training,\nspecial evaluations, service plans, medical exams, medical passports, and\nsupervisory approval of reports. The CA indicated the pandemic and staffing had an\neffect on some areas of compliance. The CA reported fully implementing the CAP\nand continuing to review and assess progress with staff and leadership over the past\nyear. It was noted in the CAA that despite the licensing violations most metrics show\ncompliance of 80-95%.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted with two agency staff. Both staff had been with the\nagency approximately three years, one in licensing and one in foster care. Both\nstated they felt supported by management and felt it was a wonderful place to work.\nStaff reported no concerns about the agency.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\n7",
    "Based on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n_ ______________May 12, 2022______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 12, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
