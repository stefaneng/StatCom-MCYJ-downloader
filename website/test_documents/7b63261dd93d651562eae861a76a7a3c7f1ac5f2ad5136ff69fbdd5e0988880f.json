    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing a youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 2/24/24 Supervisor 1 allegedly grabbed Youth A and hit him in\nthe stomach.\nInvestigation I spoke individually to Administrator 1, Complainant 1, and\nFCW 1 on 2/27/24 via telephone. Allegations were discussed. No\nnew information was provided.\nOn 2/28/24, I completed the below interviews with DHHS Worker\n1 at the facility.\nYouth A:\nYouth A initially reported he was not punched in the stomach by\nany staff or youth, but then changed his mind and reported he was\npunched in the stomach by Supervisor 1. Youth A reported he was\npunched after dinner and this occurred inside the unit building.\nYouth A was not able to provide any other details on time or\nlocation. Youth A reported he cursed at staff and called Staff 1\nnames. Youth A reported then Supervisor 1 punched him. Youth A\nno longer wanted to be interviewed and asked to leave the room.\nSupervisor 1:\nSupervisor 1 reported he was in the unit office when Youth A\nasked him if he could use the phone to call his grandmother.\nSupervisor 1 reported they called, but she did not pick up the\nphone. After this, Youth A became upset, cussed at everyone and\nleft the unit. Supervisor 1 reported he walked with him outside\nand then they came back into the building. No one else was\naround at this time. Youth A began kicking the doors inside and\ngrabbed a folder off the wall and threw the papers in the folder on\nthe floor. Supervisor 1 reported he was redirecting Youth A’s\nbehavior, but Youth A would not listen. Supervisor 1 reported he\n2",
    "bent down to grab the papers thrown on the floor and extended\nhis hand so that Youth A would not come close to him while he\nwas picking items up from the floor. Youth A did come close and\nSupervisor 1 reported his hand touched Youth A’s stomach. Youth\nA fell to the floor and said, “You punched me!” Youth A then left\nthe unit and Supervisor 1 followed him. Youth A was eventually\ndeescalated later in the evening.\nVideo Observation:\nI reviewed video on 2/24/24 at 3:45pm. Supervisor 1 and Youth A\nwere the only ones in the unit hallway. Youth A is walking around\nthe unit and grabbed a folder off the wall, causing paper from the\nfolder to fall on the floor. Youth A was within a couple feet of\nSupervisor 1. Supervisor 1 bent down to pick up the paperwork\nand extended his arm out. Supervisor 1’s hand does touch Youth\nA's stomach, but not with a force. Youth A fell to the ground\nholding his stomach and when Supervisor 1 did not react to his\nbehavior, Youth A stood up and pushed Supervisor 1. Supervisor\n1 did not react to Youth A’s assault.\nDocuments:\n• I reviewed a written statement completed by Supervisor 1\non 2/24/24 to Administrator 2 outlining the issues that\nYouth A had on 2/24/24 throughout the afternoon shift.\nSupervisor 1’s documentation aligns with his interview\naccount.\n• I reviewed Supervisor 1’s personnel file. All training and\nclearances are up to date. Supervisor 1 does not have\ndisciplinary action in his file.\nAnalysis Based on Supervisor 1’s interview and the review of the video\nfootage, it is clear that Supervisor 1 did not punch Youth A in the\nstomach.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n3/27/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
