That CAP addressed 12 areas on non-compliance, 9 of which the\nagency maintained compliance during this inspection. Two of the remaining 3\nviolations, medical passports and PATP signatures were repeated during this\ninspection; however there has been a reduction in the number of incidents of each\nviolation.
