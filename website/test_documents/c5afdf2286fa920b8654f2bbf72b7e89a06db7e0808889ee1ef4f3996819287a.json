    "Allegation The agency does not have enough staff and operate out of ratio\non second shift almost daily.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was contacted on 2/25/2025. Complainant did not\nprovide additional information.\nOn 2/27/2025 a video conference was held with the Chief\nAdministrator, Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, and the\ninvestigating consultant. During this video conference it was\nreported by the Chief Administrator that the facility has been\ncounting employees in roles such as nurse, teachers, and\ntherapists in the ratio. It was clarified by Staff 5 that these staff\nmembers could only be counted if they were not on duty for their\ntypical job function and were on the floor.\nOn 3/20/2025 the consultant completed a check in with the Chief\nAdministrator who reported that the ratios were in compliance that\nafternoon. The consultant requested that the Chief Administrator\nprovide documentation to show total number of youth as well as\nstaff and their positions.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 3/28/25.\nYouth A reported he does not have any concerns with the staff or\nhow many staff are at the facility. Youth A reported the staff make\nsure they have enough people and if they will not then someone\nwill come over from across the street when the shift changes.\nYouth A reported he thinks there is supposed to be one staff to\nevery five youth. Youth A reported that if someone comes to help\nthey are not doing any other job when they are doing that.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 3/28/25.\nYouth B reported that things are going well with staff at the facility.\nYouth B reported he does not have any concerns regarding how\nmany staff are working in the afternoons. Youth B reported that he\nthinks there are enough staff working and knows if they may not\nother people come to make sure. Youth B reported if people come\nfrom across the street or a therapist comes they do not do any\nother work when they are working on the floor.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 3/28/25.\nStaff 6 denied that there is ever a time when there are not enough\nstaff to account for the five to one ratio required for direct care.\nStaff 6 reported it is determined before the shift if they need more\nstaff to meet the ratio and if they do either other staff come down\nto assist or staff come from across the street. Staff 6 denied that\nany staff that come to assist are doing multiple jobs at the same\ntime. Staff 6 denied awareness of where the allegation would\ncome from that the facility operates under ratio.\n2",
    "Staff 7 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 3/28/25.\nStaff 7 reported the facility does not operate with less than the\nrequired ratio, any time. Staff 7 reported they count youth and staff\nbefore the start of the shift to make sure they are in ratio and if\nthey are not they will obtain staff from across the street or other\nroles at the facility to come and serve as direct staff. Staff 7\nreported that when therapists or other positions come to serve as\ndirect staff, they do not do two jobs at once, they serve as direct\nstaff. Staff 7 reported that she is not sure why it would be alleged\nthat they operate under ratio and stated that there is a staff there\nthat likes to cause issues.\nDocumentation review:\n• Facility Policy – Appropriate Staffing Levels dated 02/2025.\nThe policy specifies that the staff ratio is 5 to 1 during\nwaking hours and 8 to 1 during sleeping hours.\n• Staff roster for 3/20/2025. Roster shows that there were 25\nyouth placed in the facility and there were 6 Residential\nCare Specialists, Supervisor, and a director present. This\nexceeds the minimum ratio of 5 to 1.\n• Email dated 4/9/2025 from the Chief Administrator. Email\ndetails training of staff roster and breakdown of staff that\ncome to assist from the other building. Email states that the\nindividuals from the inpatient unit are frequent fill-ins when\nthere are gaps in the RTC schedule. Individuals from\ninpatient units are paired with an experienced RTC staff\nmember and receive on the job training. The facility has\ninstituted a cross-training program for all new staff\ncompleting orientation which they complete before\nvolunteering to cover RTC shifts.\nAnalysis A violation is not established regarding the licensing rule. It was\nreported by staff and youth that if there are not enough staff prior\nto the shift, staff will come to assist from other areas and the ratio\nof 5 to 1 will be met. It was consistently denied that nurses,\ntherapists, or teachers are doing multiple jobs simultaneously.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n3",
