During the review the agency had fourteen violations. Four\nviolations were noted as repeat violations in the current inspection. During this\nperiod under review the agency noted that overall compliance was impacted, in\npart, by staff turnover.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment reported the agency's difficulty in meeting requirements during\nthis review period. The agency has experienced high staff turnover. As a result,\nthe agency is constantly training new staff, and this also takes up a lot of time for\nsupervisors. In addition to staff turnover, the agency has experienced a high\nnumber of placement crises over the past review period. This has added to the job\nstress.\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) stated the previous year CAP yielded some\nimprovements. The agency made several changes to how HR files are managed\nto ensure compliance. The agency has also implemented additional tracking for\nspecial investigations and medical passports that have been successful. Internal\nquarterly file audits are also being completed to assist with compliance. The CA\nexpressed confidence that several areas will improve over the next review period.\nFinancial Overview\n8",
    "Financial records were reviewed and there were no concerns identified.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via telephone.
