Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 allegedly called Youth A names and attempted to provoke\nhim to fight.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was texted on 3/11/25 and a voicemail was left on\n3/12/25. Complainant was noted as anonymous, but attempts\nwere made to contact but with no avail.\nAdministrator 1 reported via email on 3/17/25 the alleged\nincident occurred on 2/8/25. Staff 1 was no longer working at the\nfacility.\nYouth A is placed at Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center.\nConsultant interviewed him on 3/13/25 face to face. Youth A\nreported he got up when he heard cards shuffling and loud music. He\nnoticed Staff 1 playing with his cards. Youth A reported he asked Staff 1\nwhy he was playing with his cards. Staff 1 said, “Shit gonna be taken”.\nYouth A reported he challenged Staff 1 to take something else and Staff\n1 took the remote. Staff 1 then approached Youth A, face to face, and\nswung.

Youth A and Staff 1 then “got into each\nother’s face.” Youth B reported when Staff 1 stood up to grab the\n2",
    "remote, he yanked up his pants as if taunting Youth A to fight him. When\nthey were face to face, they both pushed each other. Youth B reported\nhe did not see either hit or punch. Youth B reported Staff 2 took Youth A\nto the other side of the unit and Supervisor came into the unit and Staff\n1 left.\nYouth C reported he was present in the unit when Staff 1 and Youth A\nwere arguing.

Youth A was at a\n“high speed” so he was sitting on the couch attempting to\ndeescalate. Staff 1 came into the unit to provide a break to the\nother staff (unknown) in the unit. Staff 2 grabbed a separate set of\ncards and Youth A said, “those are mine.” Staff 1 responded by\nsaying, “quit acting like a bitch.” Youth A then came over to the\ntable and grabbed his cards from the table and sat back down.\nBoth Staff 1 and Youth A began arguing and Staff 2 heard Staff 1\nsay, “say that to my face.” Staff 2 reported the statements from\nStaff 1 were aggressive. Staff 2 could not remember all the words\nused. Both Youth A and Staff 1 then walked towards each other\nand Staff 2 reported she went between them. Staff 2 reported she\ntook Youth A to another part of the unit and called on the radio for\nSupervisor to help. Staff 1 continued to say words to Youth A as\nshe moved him. Supervisor came into the unit and Staff 1 left with\nher. Staff 2 reported she never saw anyone pushing or hitting.\nStaff 2 reported she was able to get between them.\nSupervisor was interviewed via telephone on 3/31/25. Supervisor\nreported she did not see the incident but was told my Staff 2 that\nStaff 1 and Youth A were arguing and that she was able to\nseparate them. Staff 2 had told her Staff 1 was “stepping up” to\nYouth A as if to physically fight him. Supervisor reported Staff 1\nwas sent home.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on 3/28/25. Staff 1 reported\nhe came into the unit and grabbed the playing cards. Youth A got\nupset and started arguing with him. Staff 1 reported he told Youth\nA he “would take the remote too.” Staff 1 reported he had just\nwent to a training at the facility where the trainer told them that if a\nyouth has something they are not supposed to, staff can take it.\nStaff 1 reported he walked up to Youth A and grabbed the remote\nfrom his hands. Youth A began cussing at him and then Staff 2\n3",
    "came over and grabbed Youth A and took him to the back of the\nunit. Staff 1 reported he did not call Youth A any names, did not\nswear at him, or attempt to hit him or push him. Staff 1 reported he\nfelt Staff 2 overreacted to the situation. Staff 2 reported he left the\nunit because he was done covering a break for a staff in the unit.\nVideo Reviewed\nThe agency does have cameras, but video footage was\nunavailable as the incident took place outside of the agency’s\nvideo footage retention.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file\no Staff 1 was hired on 10/7/24\no Central registry was completed on 9/25/24\no Staff 1 received training on “Punitive measures”,\n“Behavior Management” on 9/12/24.\no Staff 1 was terminated due to this incident.\nEmployee Counseling Form dated 2/8/25, reported\nStaff 1 had “unsatisfactory work performance. It was\nnoted as “erratic work behavior.”\n• I reviewed the Behavior Notification Form. The form was\ndated 2/8/25 and reported by Staff 2 to Supervisor.\nStaff began to make unnecessary comments such\nas “Fuck them cards” and “bitch ass nigga.” Staff\nbegin to walk to Youth A getting into Youth A’s face\nthreatening to “whoop his ass.”\nAnalysis The agency is in violation of this rule. Based on interviews with\nyouth and staff, Staff 1 was verbally aggressive with Youth A. He\nswore at Youth A and threatened Youth A. The incident report\nwritten on 2/8/25, confirmed he threatened Youth A by threatening\nto “whoop his ass.” Staff 1 also called Youth A derogatory names.\nTechnial Assistance:\nStaff 1 was hired by the agency through a “temp agency.” It was\nnoted on the personnel file that he was hired on 10/7/24, yet he\nreceived the agency’s orientation on 9/12/24. Staff 1 was\nemployed and received financial compensation from the agency\nfor this orientation. R. 400.4128 (1) states, “the licensee shall\nprovide an orientation program for new employees…” Staff 1 was\nconsidered an employee when he received orientation; therefore,\nall other rules outlined in the Licensing Rules for Child Caring\nInstitutions, must be followed. Administrator 2 reported the agency\n4",
    "no longer uses the “temp agency” and that they were only used for\na critical time for the agency. If the agency decided to use a “temp\nagency” in the future, policies and procedures will need to be\ncompleted to ensure this method of hiring is in accordance with\nrules.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n4/21/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
