    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 4 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had three corrective action plans related to special investigations and\none corrective action plan related to the 2022 renewal audit. The special\ninvestigation corrective action plans were regarding violations for staff sufficiency,\nstaff supervision, and resident restraints. The facility resolved these issues by\nhaving further training regarding restraints, increasing the number of staff in the\nfacility and increasing communication amongst employees. The most significant\nimpact to improving these areas was an increase in hiring beginning in June 2022.\nThe facility is now fully staffed. The 2022 renewal audit had a citation regarding\nstaff evaluations, which was not found as an issue during the period of review for\nthis 2023 interim audit.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's financial information was reviewed and there were no concerns.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported the facility was able to improve the area of\ncompleting timely staff evaluations through increased diligence by the Project\nCoordinator tracking these reviews and the Manager of Program Operations\nworking closely with supervisors to ensure compliance. CA noted hiring employees\nsignificantly improved in June 2022 and DART is now at a fully staffing schedule.\nAs a result, the facility has been able to increase their census back to pre-COVID\nlevels. One continuing area of concern for the facility is access to comprehensive\ndental treatment for residents who require sedation as it has been an ongoing\nbarrier. Although all youth are currently up to date with their dental appointments,\nthere have been historical late appointments for youth who require sedation to\nachieve dental cleanings at 6 and 12-month timeframes. CA reported one CAP\nactivity demonstrated a positive impact for DART's program compliance, which was\nthe Project Coordinator and Human Resources working collaboratively regarding\nreview of onboarding documentation and updating practices based on updated\nlicensing rules and contract requirements. Additionally, the Manager of Program\nOperations has worked diligently with the Assistant Program Managers to improve\ndocumentation, staff coaching, and compliance with policies and procedures by\nstaff. CA noted the Project Coordinator has improved monitoring and tracking of\ndocumentation efforts by collaborating with multiple departments within the\n3",
    "program and will continue to focus efforts on making the program more efficient\nthrough process and procedures changes, maintaining organization of\ncommunication tools, agendas, and CAP compliance monitoring. During the period\nof review, DART identified there were two unplanned discharges for youth in the\nCA report. However, after review of the situations, the facility provided advanced\nnotice and a discharge plan was followed for each youth prior to discharge.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviews were all very positive. Staff feel supervisors and upper\nmanagement always take into consideration what staff say and always have an\nopen-door policy. Staff felt the facility has a great working environment and feel\nvery supported by each other, supervisors, and upper management. Staff feel even\nif there are conflicts amongst staff or surrounding situations, everyone can work\nthose out and communicate openly. Staff feel the communication surrounding\nchanges, safety plans, admissions of new youth, etc. are communicated very well\nand they always feel they know what's going on. Staff feel they have enough\ntraining to be able to complete their job duties and feel the extra shadow shifts new\nstaff complete are great to get them prepared for the job. The only suggestion staff\nmade was to make sure all necessary staff are included in the group chat as\nsometimes people are missing and they'll miss some of the news and updates\nothers are providing, which impacts communication.\nThe youth interviewed did not have any concerns with the facility. They reported the\nstaff treat them well, they feel safe, they like the food, and they have enough food.\nThey reported they did not have any complaints or things they would like to change.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility was completed on 4/6/23 and there were no concerns\nnoted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMay 4, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 4, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4",
