For example, if a young\nperson runs into the woods near the river, staff should\nattempt to follow the exact same path of the young person\nup until it creates physical risk of harm for the staff\nperson(s) (i.e. lose footing and slip, can’t fit into a small\n6",

Youth outside must be\ndirectly observed—not watched from indoors.\n• A 3:1 staff-to-youth ratio is maintained during the day and\n10:1 at night. Temporary exceptions (e.g., AWOL or\nrestraints) don’t mean the ratio is unmet due to extra staff\ncoverage.\n• At night, staff must visually check each youth hourly and at\n15-minute intervals, documenting from when they enter\ntheir room until morning.\n• Stay mobile and engaged: Staff must walk the milieu,\nremain aware of all youth, and engage through\nconversation and interaction.
