Administrator 1 reported\nYouth B is no longer in the facility but in Nebraska. Administrator 1\nreported Youth B had experienced past abuse and neglect. Youth\nB had a tendency to make up stories while in care. Administrator 1\nreported while Youth B was in placement she did file a grievance\nin June 2023. The allegations were that Youth C had made\ninappropriate comments and attempted to put his arm around her\nshoulder and touched her leg.

She was placed in a facility in\nNebraska. Attempts were made to contact her on 6/4/24 and\n6/24/24, but to no avail.\nOn 5/31/24, I completed the following interviews at the\nfacility:\nYouth B reported Youth A had sex with Youth C in one of the\nbedrooms on the unit. Youth B could not provide a specific day, a\nspecific time of day, or what specific staff were working at the\nfacility. Youth B reported Youth A told her she had sex with Youth\nC. Youth B reported she did not actually see anything. Youth B\n2",
    "reported there are always three staff working on the unit and\neleven youth. Youth B reported she did not know how they would\nget into a room together due to the bedrooms being locked. Youth\nB reported “control room” unlocks the bedroom doors for youth\nand staff. Youth B reported doors automatically lock when closed\nand bedroom doors are not left open.\nYouth C reported he was on the same unit as Youth A during a\npart of her placement at the facility.

Supervisor 1 reported he never saw any touching or\nhugging between Youth A and Youth C. After the safety plan was\nin place, there were no other grievances or complaints from Youth\n3",
    "A.
