    "determined. Revocation of the license was recommended and submitted on\n8/04/2023. The revocation is currently in process and has not yet been completed.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nprevious renewal evaluation for St. Clair County DHHS completed in April 2023\nindicated noncompliance in the areas of Rule 324(8), FOM 722-06 B, and FOM\n722-08 D. None of the areas were identified as repeat noncompliance as a part of\nthis interim evaluation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was a review of the agency’s compliance\nwith their Corrective Action Plan for the most recent renewal evaluation. The\nassessment indicated the agency continues to struggle with timely signatures and\nconsistency with following the CAP procedures. Despite this barrier the trend\nidentified in the assessment was positive and the CAP appeared to have a\npositive impact in areas where total compliance was not yet achieved.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nChild Welfare Staff participated in entrance and exit conferences. Interviews did\nnot indicate any areas of concern.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, and licensing services. All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\n4",
