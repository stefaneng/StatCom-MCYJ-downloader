He said he was transferred three weeks ago from Pineview Homes to\n2",
    "Lincoln Center. Resident Z is a DHHS/JJ contracted youth in placement for charges of\nResisting Arrest and Assault on a Police Officer.\nResident Z explained how the lock on his bedroom door would stick. He told a few staff\nand his therapist about it. Sometimes it would not lock on its own and the staff had to\nmanually use their key. Yesterday (11/16/20), Resident Z confirmed that the lock on his\ndoor had finally been fixed.\nOn 11/14/20 at 9am before the lock was fixed, Resident Z said Resident N threw a chair\ninto his room. “I came out. Resident N pushed me and I pushed him back. He started\nhitting me in the back of the head where my shunt is. Another kid told him to stop.\nSecurity came and put Resident N in his room.” Resident Z said Staff 1 was working\nalone on the pod with 7 youth when this happened.\nAfter the assault, Resident Z said he saw the facility’s nurse and was given ice for his\nhead. Then the following morning, he was taken to Children’s Hospital and diagnosed\nwith a Head Contusion.\nI interviewed Staff 1 who has worked at the facility for over six years. He acknowledged\nResident Z’s room door did not always lock properly. Staff 1 said he submitted a\nmaintenance request to have the door fixed but had no record of it. “It’s been broken\nbefore,” he added.\nStaff 1 said he was working on the pod the morning of 11/14/20 but did not see anyone\nthrow a chair into Resident Z’s room. “I was passing out breakfast and the kids called\nmy name. I saw Resident N hitting Resident Z in his head or chest area. I called for\nsecurity…I separated them. I think security came in and assisted.” Staff 1 could not\nrecall what security officer or officers arrived; or if staff separated the youth or the\naggressor stopped on his own. “I noticed Resident Z’s nose bleeding and called the\nsupervisor and nurse. The nurse looked at him within minutes.”\nI interviewed Therapist 1 who has worked at the facility for eight months. She said\nResident Z mentioned to her that his door only locked with a key while the other youth’s\ndoors locked when shut. Therapist 1 said she repeatedly asked direct care staff (on\n10/29, 11/5 and 11/12) to move Resident Z to a vacant room because his door was not\nlocking properly. “There was an open room on the pod but they (staff) never switched\nhis room,” she explained.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4407 Facility and premises maintenance.\n(1) A facility and premises shall be maintained in a clean,\ncomfortable, and safe condition. The facility shall be\nlocated on land that is properly drained.\nANALYSIS: Sleeping in a room that did not consistently lock when it was\nshut posed a safety risk to Resident Z. Facility staff including\nthe Center Director were aware of the malfunction for several\nweeks. The therapist said she requested Resident Z be moved\nto another room for three consecutive weeks but the staff failed\nto facilitate the change. A part for the door was ordered and the\nlock was repaired on 11/16/20. However, on 11/14/20 another\nresident threw a chair into Resident Z’s room and then\nassaulted him. The facility did not keep Resident Z safe by\nknowingly keeping him in a room that did not properly lock.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue a First Provisional license.\nNovember 23, 2020\n_________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 2, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
