She said they are in the process of installing cameras\nin the cottages, but there are no cameras in the bathrooms or\nbedrooms.\nI walked through the cottages on 09/22/2023 and observed\nbedrooms, bathrooms, living room, dining room, and kitchen area.\nOne bathroom shower door needed cleaning, but the facility is in\nthe process of replacing the shower doors with shower curtains.\nThis is not neglect but observed to need cleaning. The rest of the\nrooms were found to be clean, neat, no mold in the refrigerator, and\nall light fixtures working.
