The agency\nis in compliance with eight of the citations addressed in that CAP. Three of the\nviolations found during the 2023 inspection were repeated from 2021 and 2022\nand two were repeated from 2021 only. These violations will require additional\ncorrective action planning. Three non-repeat violations were found during this\ninspection, two of which were related to special evaluations and one of which was\nan isolated incident involving medical passport completion.
