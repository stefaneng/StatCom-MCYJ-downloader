Staff 4\nreported that she works at the IL home one day per week on each\nof the facility’s three work shifts. She worked the midnight shift on\n12/3/2023.\nDHHS Worker X\n3",
    "On 12/6/2022 I spoke with the Department of Health and Human\nServices Worker (DHHS) X by telephone. DHHS Worker X’s role\nis to assure the safety of Youth A and other youths. She is not the\nassigned foster care worker responsible for the overall care of\nYouth A. DHHS Worker X contacted the agency. The agency\nreported not knowing about the situation of Youth A being missing\nor other circumstances until around 3:00 AM the next day\n(12/4/2023). Staff 4 discovered Youth A was missing as Staff 4\nwas preparing to leave to take Youth C to the hospital, due to a\nmedical issue. Staff 4 needed to take all three of the youths (who\nresided in the home at the time) with her (to ensure for their\nsupervision) and Youth A was not in her room. It was during Staff\n4’s interaction with Youth B and Youth C that both youths\neventually disclosed what had occurred pertaining to Youth A’s\nabsence.\nAllegations: Staff assisted AWOL; staff helped the youth\navoid camaras; the staff tried to contact youths after the\nincident; Youth B was bribed not to tell about AWOL with\nfood and vape\nStaff 4\nStaff 4 confirmed the information reported by DHHS Worker X as\nto how she discovered Youth A’s absence from the IL home and\nstaff not being allowed to leave the youth home alone on her\nmidnight shift on 12/3/2022. Staff 4 said Youth A was not in her\nroom and some of Youth A’s belongings were missing. Youth B\nreported to Staff 4 that she helped Youth A to AWOL.\nStaff 4 reported since she could not connect with the IL program’s\non-call staff for assistance, she took Youth B and Youth C to the\nhospital with her. She had Staff 5 pick Youth B up from the\nhospital, as Youth B was not allowed back in the treatment area.\nWhile at the hospital, Youth C told Staff 4 Youth B lied about\nhelping Youth A AWOL, and that it was Staff 3 who helped Youth\nA leave the IL home. Youth C reported Staff 3 drove Youth A to\nthe bus station and Youth B accompanied them. Youth C\nreported further that Staff 3 provided Youth B with cigarettes, a\nvape pen and dinner to not tell what Staff 3 did. Staff 4 said that\nYouth B later reported the same information regarding Staff 3 to\nStaff 5.\nStaff 4 said she also telephoned Staff 3 after the incident. Staff 3\ndid not answer but called her back. She asked Staff 3 if Staff 3\nknew where Youth A was, and advised Staff 3, that Staff 4 and\nYouth C were at the hospital. Staff 3 skipped over the question\n4",
    "about Youth A with a quick no and asked, “what’s happening at\nthe hospital”. Staff 3 showed up at the hospital later without notice\nor a request for Staff 3 to come there.\nStaff 4 said she spoke with Program Director (PD) 2 (who was on\nvacation during the incident) around 5:00PM on 12/4/2023. She\ninformed him of the situation and what Youth C disclosed. PD 2\nasked to speak with Youth C, and Youth C reported the same\ninformation to PD 2 that Youth C had reported to her.\nStaff 4 said she arrived back to the IL house when Staff 5 was\ntaking Youth B’s statement. She heard Youth B affirming what\nYouth C reported about these allegations. Youth B then went to\nYouth B’s room and came back with two Breeze vape pens, a\npack of Black and Mild’s, and another pen for marijuana that had\nbeen left by Youth A. Youth B reported that Staff 3 would buy\nthem alcohol and vapes all the time. Further, that Staff 3 had also\npurchased alcohol for Youth D, who was a prior youth at the\nhome. Youth B reported when they got their stipend funds, they\nwould take money from their stipend card and Staff 3 would drive\nthem to the marijuana dispenser. Youth B said Staff 3 would use\nStaff 3’s driver’s license to buy them marijuana. Youth B reported\nnot knowing why Staff 3 did those things for them, because Staff 3\nnever asked them for monetary reimbursement.\nStaff 4 said Youth A is still AWOL. Youth C was discharged last\nnight (12/5/22), and Youth B, was allowed to go visit Youth B’s\naunt and is not expected back to the IL home until later tonight\n(12/6/2022).\nYouth A\nOn 12/7/2022, I interviewed Youth A by telephone (due to possible\nCOVID issues), along with DHHS Worker XZ who was onsite with\nthe youth at a DHHS office.\nYouth A reported living at Samaritas’ s IL home for eight months\nprior to leaving to be with Person ZZ (whom she referenced as\n“My husband”) up north (Hancock, Michigan) for the last couple of\ndays. Youth A reported that she got from the IL home to Hancock,\nMichigan by bus. She said staff saw her leave because that staff\nperson drove her to the bus station to meet up with Person ZZ.\nYouth A initially said she would not identify the staff that drove her,\nthat she is not “a snitch”, but then she named Staff 3 as that staff\nperson. She said Staff 3 took her to the Indian Track bus station\nand waited with her and Person ZZ rode the bus out of town with\nher. She said it was none of our business as to who purchased\n5",
    "the bus ticket for her. She said she left the IL home in the middle\nof the day with Staff 3 and Youth B, who came along to the bus\nstation, but did not get on the bus.\nYouth A said she asked Staff 3 to take her to the bus station and\nthat it was planned. She said she planned it for a couple of days.\nShe told Staff 3 her plan,asked Staff 3 the night before to help her\nand Staff 3 said, “okay”. Youth A reported only the two youths in\nplacement knew Staff 3 would be taking her to the bus station.\nYouth A affirmed that the IL home has cameras. She said the\ncameras are set to view the outside, not inside of the home. She\ndid not specifically report Staff 3 helping her to avoid the cameras.\nYouth A reported the day she left, Youth B, not Staff 3, helped her\nto take her luggage/belongings to Staff 3’s car. This was with\nStaff 3’s knowledge.\nYouth A denied that there was a discussion about how Staff 3\nwould report Youth A being gone. She said Youth C stayed at the\nhouse alone when Staff 3 drove them to the bus station. Youth A\nreported after it was discovered that she was gone, Youth B and\nYouth C were telephoning her, telling her, or yelling at her that she\nneeded to tell Children’s Services what happened. Youth A did not\ndisclose any information regarding Staff 3 calling her after the\ndeparture.\nYouth C\nOn 12/7/2022, I interviewed Youth C by telephone (due to\npossible COVID issues), along with DHHS Worker X who was\nonsite at the IL home.\nYouth C reported on the Wednesday or Thursday prior to Youth A\nAWOLing, Youth A told her Youth A was going to leave the home,\nand Staff 3 was going to assist her. Youth C collaborated aspects\nof what Youth A reported related to Staff 3 helping Youth A to\nAWOL, driving Youth A to the bus station to meet Person ZZ,\nYouth B accompanying them, them leaving her home alone, and\nStaff 3 purchasing Youth A and Youth B vapes. Youth C reported\nnot actually seeing Staff 3 purchase the vapes but said Youth A\nand Youth B told her Staff 3 had (Youth C later reported she had\nwitnessed such).\nYouth C said Staff 3 said they were going to have to make it look\nas if Youth A left the next day/on the next shift from when Youth A\nactually left. This would mean that Youth A did not leave on Staff\n3’s shift. Youth C said she disclosed all of what happened about\n6",
    "the incident to IL staff while she was at the hospital. Youth C said\nwhen Staff 4 came to work for Staff 4’s shift later on Saturday,\nStaff 4 asked who all were there and she told Staff 4 Youth A was\nnot. Staff 4 did not initially believe her. Nor did Staff 4 go upstairs\nto check, even after she said she made a video showing Youth A’s\nroom empty. Staff 4 discovered Youth A was missing when Staff 4\nhad to round everyone up so Staff 4 could take Youth C to the\nhospital.\nYouth C reported Youth B, not Staff 3, was helping Youth A to\navoid the IL home’s cameras. Youth B had done it before to sneak\nboys into the home, reportedly with Staff 3’s awareness of such.\nYouth C reported knowing that later because Youth B had\ncommented after having a boy in the home one night, that she had\nsex and Staff 3 commented “where is the condom?” Youth C said\naccording to Youth B the cameras only showed the driver side of\nStaff 3’s car and Youth A went out the living room’s side door and\ngot in the passenger side of Staff 3’s car.\nStaff 5\nOn 12/7/2022, I interviewed Staff 5 by telephone (due to possible\nCOVID issues), along with DHHS Worker X who was onsite at the\nIL home.\nStaff 5 said she was not working the day/shift that Youth A\nAWOLed. She said Staff 4 called her about 2:00AM about\nneeding to take Youth C to the hospital, and an inability to get\nSamaritas’ on-call staff. Staff 5 suggested Staff 4 round up all the\nyouths to take with Staff 4, and that’s when Staff 4 discovered\nYouth A was missing.\nStaff 5 said she and Staff 4 both reached out to Samaritas’ on-call\nstaff again for assistance. Around 4:00 AM Staff 4 requested Staff\n5 pick Youth B up from the hospital, which Staff 5 did. Staff 5 also\nspoke with Youth B about the incident, and Youth B initially said\nYouth A had snuck out. Staff 5 said she made a police report\nabout Youth A being missing. The police came out and took the\nstatement and she wrote an incident report.\nStaff 5 reported it was not until after she had spoken with PD 2\n(around 6:00AM) to report Youth A’s AWOL and other events had\nhappened (Staff 3 showing up at the hospital, the IL home, and\nleaving), that she learned more details of what had transpired\nrelated to Youth A’s AWOL incident and other allegations. Staff 5\nsaid on the morning of 12/4/2022, PD 2 had instructed her to\nescort Staff 3 out the IL home and as Staff 3 was leaving the\n7",
    "home, Staff 3 reportedly tried to communicate with Youth B via a\nwindow. Youth B told Staff 5 that. Youth B said Staff 3 knocked on\nYouth B’s window. Youth B said Staff 3 asked her whether they\nall had stuck to the story they came up with about Youth A\nleaving. Youth B told Staff 3 that Youth C told on Staff 3. Youth B\nsaid Staff 3 thanked her for having her back. Staff 5 reported it\nwas after this, that Youth B “came clean” about what had\noccurred. Staff 5 confirmed the information that Staff 4 reported\nYouth B had disclosed to Staff 5 about Staff 3 helping Youth A to\nAWOL, taking Youth A to the bus station, trying to bribe Youth B\nwith Black and Mild products and other items. Also that Staff 3\nmoved her car, had Youth A go out the side door, so that Youth A\nwould not be seen putting her clothing into Staff 3’s car.\nStaff 5 denied any knowledge of the youths’ plan to AWOL. She\nsaid Youth B reported that Youth A had been planning to run away\nfor a week. Youth B also reported to have had a video of what\nStaff 3 said to her when Staff 3 knocked on the window, but what\nStaff 5 was shown was a video of Staff 3 being at the bus station\nwith the youths.\nYouth B\nOn 12/8/2022, I interviewed Youth B by telephone (due to possible\nCOVID issues) along with DHHS Worker X who was onsite with\nYouth B at the youth’s grandmother’s home.\nYouth B confirmed information reported by Youth A, Youth C, Staff\n4 and Staff 5 with respect to Youth A’s AWOL, how the AWOL\ntranspired, Staff 3’s involvement in that, Staff 3 buying her food\n(McDonalds) so she would not tell, and Staff 3 knocking on her\nwindow the next day advising her not to tell. Youth B reported\nwhen Staff 3 knocked on her window Staff 3 told her she got fired\nand for her and Youth C to stick to the story. Youth B said she told\nStaff 3 she had stuck to the story, but Youth C had not.\nYouth B reported the day Youth A AWOLed, she, Youth A and\nStaff 3 left the home around 1:30pm. She said Youth A told her\nearlier in that day that Youth A was leaving to go take a bus with\nPerson ZZ and that she had been planning it for about a week.\nProgram Director 2\nOn 1/4/2023, DHHS Worker XX and I interviewed Program\nDirector 2 (PD), onsite at the IL home.\nPD 2 reported he has been serving in a dual role of program\nmanager and case manager since, 11/3/2022. The November\n8",
    "date is when the prior case manager, Case Manager 6 left the\nagency. PD 2 reported he was on vacation at the time of the\nincident. He was alerted of the incident by Staff 5 via text\nmessage around 4:40 AM on Sunday, 12/4/2022. He reported\nStaff 5 informed him Staff 4 called her informing her Staff 4\ndiscovered Youth A was missing, that all of Youth A ‘s things were\ngone, and that Youth A must have left some time around midnight\nor 1:00 AM.\nPD2 said he called Staff 4 and Staff 5 and each confirmed the\nincident. Staff 4 reported what Youth C reported about Staff 3\nhelping Youth A to AWOL and the use of the cameras. Staff 4\nalso told him that when she arrived for her 11:00PM shift, Staff 3\ntold her Youth A was in her room. PD 2 reported “the protocol is\nto do a check of all rooms to ensure all the girls are there,” but\nStaff 4 did not. Staff 4 went with what Staff 3 reported to her.\nPD 2 reported after Staff 4 and Staff 5 shared the information\nabout Youth A being missing, and Staff 3 helping the youth get\npast the camera’s view, he reviewed the camera footage via his\nphone. He said the cameras point to the front door and outside\ndriveway, which allows staff to see who is coming inside and\noutside of the house. He reported the camera footage showed\nsome aspects of what Youth B reported related to them going out\nthe side door when Youth A was leaving the home. The three left\naround 12:00 noon after Staff 3 had moved her car from full view\nof the cameras. He said Staff 3 and Youth B arrived back to the\nhouse around 3:26PM and camera footage showed Staff 3 park\nher car in full view of the camera. Youth B got out the car and\nwaved at the camera. Later at around 8:00pm, Staff 3 is seen\ntaking Youth B out, reportedly to the store. PD 2 showed us some\nof that footage via his phone.\nPD 2 reported on 12/4/2022, prior to 7:00AM, he called Staff 3 and\nspoke with her about Youth A not being at the IL home. Staff 3\ntold him Youth A was at the house when she left the house the\nprior night at 11:00PM. PD 2 reported during their investigation of\nthis incident, they interviewed Staff 3 and Staff 3 reported the last\ntime she saw Youth A that evening was at 8:00PM. Given that\nstatement from Staff 3, PD 2 said they asked Staff 3 whether she\nleft a youth alone that night and Staff 3 did not answer. PD2 said\nhe also contacted Person ZZ (via Person ZZ’s mother) and\nconfirmed that Youth A was with Person ZZ. He also spoke briefly\nwith Youth A but did not go into the allegations. He said the\nagency purchased a bus ticket for Youth A to return to the IL\nhome, but Youth A did not return. On 12/7/2022, Youth A reported\n9",
    "DHHS did not want her to return. Chief Administrator 1 confirmed\nthat information with DHHS and Youth A will not be returning to\nthe IL home.\nStaff 3\nOn 1/4/2023, DHHS Worker XX and I interviewed Staff 3 at Staff\n3’s home. DHHS Worker XX read the allegations to Staff 3.\nStaff 3 denied the allegations. She affirmed her termination. She\nsaid she had been employed with the agency for a year and a\nhalf. She verified that the agency had spoken with her about the\nincident and her termination. She said Chief Administrator 1 told\nher that since this was the second time they had spoken with her\nabout allegations, they had to let her go.\nStaff 3 acknowledged knowing Youth A, Youth B, Youth C and\nYouth D. She said Youth D moved from the IL home a while ago.\nShe stated it was not true about “me sneaking the girls out and me\nmoving my car”. She said her car was leaking power steering fluid,\nand her husband told her to move it so she could see if it was\nleaking. She denied driving Youth A to the bus station. She said\nshe always works a double shift on Saturday (7:00AM-3:00PM &\n3:00PM-11:00PM) and Saturday was the last time she saw Youth\nA. She said Youth A was in the IL house when she left.\nStaff 3 reported when Staff 4 came in for the 11:00PM shift\nchange, Staff 3 assumed Youth A was in her room. Staff 3\nreported she never heard Youth A leave and she was not sure\nwhat time Youth A would have left. She said Youth A rarely came\nout of her room. She further stated Youth A came out maybe to\nget food and Youth A’s room was always trashy.\nStaff 3 denied going to the bus station with the youths on that\nSaturday or Sunday. She did not know why the other youths\nwould say she had. She reported only knowing that Youth A had\nchecked on the price of a bus ticket months ago. She said Youth\nA was always talking with her, Staff 4, and Staff 5 about running\naway, but Youth A never ran. We asked Staff 3 whether she told\nPD 2 about Youth A talking about running away. Staff 3\nresponded, “Yes. He just thought she was B.S.ing”.\nStaff 3 reported Youth A’s AWOL was brought to her attention on\nSunday (12/4/2022) by Staff 4. Staff 4 called her to say Youth C\nwas at the hospital so she went to the hospital to relieve Staff 4.\nContrary to what Staff 4 reported, Staff 3 said Staff 4 told her to\ncome to the hospital to relieve her. At that time Staff 4 told her\n10",
    "Youth A was missing. Staff 3 said if Youth A left on her shift,\nYouth A must have left when Staff 3 was at the store with Youth B\nand Youth C. Staff 3 reported they went to the store because\nYouth B wanted something to drink. They left Youth A at the\nhome.\nWe asked Staff 3 whether she checked to verify that Youth A was\nin her room when she returned from the store. Staff 3 responded,\n“No”. Staff 3 reported being gone for only 10-15 minutes and that\nshe had done this before. Staff 3 acknowledged the agency has\nprotocol around when staff can and cannot leave youths home\nalone. She reported staff being able to leave a youth home alone\nduring the day, 7:00AM-3:00PM. They cannot do so during the\nevenings, 3:00PM- 7:00 AM. During the latter hours the staff must\nbe with the youths. Staff 3 said she went to the store twice. She\nwent at 11:00AM and later “when it was dark,” but she did not\nrecall that being at 8:00PM. She said it was “more like 6:00PM or\n7:00PM”. She again reported not knowing when Youth A left the\nIL home.\nNone of the youths or other staff interviewed reported an\nawareness of Staff 3 assisting other youths to AWOL.\nCigarettes/Marijuana/vape allegation:\nStaff 4\nOn 12/6/2022, I interviewed Staff 4 by telephone and spoke with\nher briefly onsite on 1/4/2023. Staff 4 reported she/the agency\nmade this complaint.\nShe said she heard Youth B affirming what Youth C reported\nabout these allegations. Youth B then went to Youth B’s room\nand came back with two Breeze vape pens, a pack of Black and\nMild’s, and another pen for marijuana that had been left my Youth\nA. Youth B reported that Staff 3 would buy them alcohol and\nvapes all the time. Further, that Staff 3 had also purchased alcohol\nfor Youth D, who was a prior youth at the home. Youth B reported\nwhen they got their stipend funds, they would take money from\ntheir stipend card and Staff 3 would drive them to the marijuana\ndispenser. Youth B said Staff 3 would use Staff 3’s driver’s\nlicense to buy them marijuana. Youth B reported not knowing why\nStaff 3 did those things for them, because Staff 3 never charged\nthem.\nYouth A\nOn 12/7/2022, via methods as described earlier, DHHS Worker\nXZ and I interviewed Youth A. Youth A reported disapproval of\n11",
    "the IL home because she felt it was more like a residential\nprogram, and that youths were doing the “wrong things”, like\nsneaking boys in the home and smoking marijuana. The latter of\nwhich Youth A reported PD 2 told them if they are going to do it, to\ndo it outside. We asked Youth A whether she was part of “doing\nthe wrong things” related to substances, and she reported she\nwas not. We apprised Youth A that there were reports that Staff 3\nhad given youths in the home cigarettes and marijuana. We asked\nher about that. Youth A stated, “I used a vape, I won’t lie.” She\nsaid Staff 3 gave her the vape, which was in September 2022.\nShe reported Staff 3 provided marijuana, alcohol and vapes to\nYouth B. She said Staff 3 did not bring in the items. They paid for\nthe items with money from their stipends. Staff 3 purchased the\nitems while they were with Staff 3. Youth A reported, Staff 3 also\npurchased items for Youth B and Youth D. Staff 3 purchased\nvapes for Youth B more than 10 times, alcohol for Youth B once,\nand weed, which Staff 3 would get from the dispenser, an\nunknown number of times. Youth A said she asked Staff 3 to get\nher a vape pen on her birthday and Youth B and Youth D had also\nasked Staff 3 for things, which they all paid for upfront.\nYouth A reported not knowing why Staff 3 made the purchases\nknowing that doing so would get her in trouble. Youth A denied\nany other staff purchasing vapes, cigarettes, marijuana and or\nalcohol for her or any youths.\nYouth C\nOn 12/7/2022, via methods as described earlier, DHHS Worker X\nand I interviewed Youth C. Youth C reported after Staff 3 and\nYouth B returned from dropping Youth A off at the bus station, that\nsometime around 8:00PM Staff 3 took her and Youth B to the\nstore. Staff 3 asked her whether she wanted Staff 3 to buy her\nBlack and Mild cigarettes. Youth C reported she declined and\nStaff 3 bought Black and Mild’s and a vape item for Youth B using\nYouth B’s money. Youth C did not know if Youth B asked Staff 3\nto purchase those items or whether Staff 3 volunteered.\nDHHS Worker X asked Youth C about youths smoking weed at\nthe IL home, and whether PD2 reported it was okay for them to\nsmoke weed as long as they did not do so in the home. Youth C\nreported staff would smell marijuana in the youths rooms and\nreported to PD2. PD 2 never witnessed it. PD 2 had a meeting\nwith all of the youths about weed and smoking. PD2 told them “I\ncan’t stop you from doing it, but you can’t do it here”.\nStaff 5:\n12",
    "On 12/7/2022, via methods as described earlier, DHHS Worker X\nand I interviewed Staff 5. Staff 5 confirmed the allegations made\nby Youth B about the incident. Youth B went into her room and\ncame back with three cigarette vapes which Youth B reported\nStaff 3 bought for her. Youth B also brought/showed a marijuana\npen, which Youth B said belonged to Youth A. Youth B reported\nthat Youth A said Staff 3 bought the marijuana pen for Youth A.\nStaff 5 did not say why Youth B reported having the marijuana pen\nthat reportedly belonged to Youth A. Additionally, that according\nto Youth B, Staff 3 started buying Youth B vape pens, cigarette\nitems, as well as others these items, within two weeks of Youth\nB’s 7/15/2022 placement at the IL home.\nStaff 5 denied any direct knowledge of Staff 3 buying cigarettes,\nvapes, other substances for the youths. She acknowledged that\nthe staff had experienced incidents of the youths using\nsubstances. She said, there had been a lot of issues with the\nyouths smoking marijuana. She reported knowing that because\nthey had smelled it. She said all the staff had been trying to\nunderstand how to handle it. They have knocked on the specific\nyouth’s door and reminded the youth that is not allowed. They\nhave also addressed it with PD2 who has also spoken with the\nyouths. Staff 5 reported they have been advised that if the matter\nis a safety concern, they are allowed to enter the youth’s room,\nbut it’s not clear whether they can confiscate the item. Staff 5\nreported the youths said PD2 told them, about two weeks ago, PD\n2 does not condone them smoking/using marijuana, and they can’t\ndo it on the property.\nYouth B\nOn 12/8/2022, via methods as described earlier, DHHS Worker X\nand I interviewed Youth B. Youth B also confirmed Staff 3\npurchasing marijuana in the form of vapes for she and other\nyouths who had lived in the home and she and other youths using\ntheir own money. She said the reason she was not surprised that\nStaff 3 had assisted Youth A, was because Staff 3 bought alcohol\nand vapes for Youth A before, and purchased alcohol for her\ntwice, and marijuana vapes for Youth B every other week. Youth\nB reported the latter occurred more than three times, but less than\n10 times. Youth B said she has been present when Staff 3 has\npurchased marijuana vapes for Youth A, Youth D and Youth E.\nYouth B reported some youths would drink in front of Staff 3, and\nStaff 3 had allowed she and other youths to vape. Youth B said\nStaff 3 “didn’t care” that they did this, but Staff 3 did not smoke or\ndrink.\n13",
    "Youth B admitted youths are not supposed to smoke or drink in\nfront of the staff or at the facility, that there is a no drug or alcohol\npolicy that the IL home has. She also affirmed Youth C’s and Staff\n5’s reporting related to PD 2’s not condoning the use of\nsubstances and advising against such use at the IL home.\nDHHS Worker XX\nOn 12/9/2022 I spoke with DHHS Worker XX. She reported she\nwas advised by Chief Administrator 1 that Staff 3 was terminated\non 12/16/2022 and they were getting the police involved with\npossible prosecution. Also, it was noted that P2 reported going to\nthe Flint police station to make a report against Staff 3, but no one\nwas there to take the statement. The agency is intending to follow\nup later.\nProgram Director 2 & Staff 3\nOn 1/4/2023, DHHS Worker XX and I interviewed Program\nDirector 2, onsite at the IL home.\nPD 2 denied any knowledge of Staff 3 purchasing substances for\nyouths. He only knew the information that was reported by Youth\nB and Youth C with respect to these allegations. PD2 also denied\ntelling any youth it’s ok to use these items. He has told all the\nyouths they can’t use such substances on the premises, and that\nhe does not condone use of these substances. He reported they\nknow the youths smoke marijuana and Black and Mild’s, but the\nprotocol for staff if they discover a youth using, is to report it by\ncompleting an incident report. He said the staff can’t just enter a\nyouth’s room and remove such items. Once the staff reports the\nincident, he would follow up with the youth, go over the youth\nhandbook with them and advise the youth’s DHHS worker. If the\nincidents kept occurring, he would ask the court to order drug\nscreens to ascertain what further might be required.\nStaff 3\nOn 1/4/2023, DHHS Worker XX and I interviewed Staff 3 at Staff\n3’s home. DHHS Worker XX read the allegations to Staff 3. Staff\n3 denied the allegations. She said it is not true that she bought\nthe youths vapes, cigarettes, marijuana, alcohol or Taco Bell. She\nsaid she told Chief Administrator 1, “these girls are out to get me.\nThat I didn’t buy the things for the kids to bribe them”. She said\nshe was also never told that she could not buy things for the\nyouths.\nStaff 3 said, Youth B goes home for the weekends, and that is\nwhere Youth B gets her Black and Mild’s, marijuana, and vape\n14",
    "pens. Staff 3 did not report how she knew that that is where or\nwhen Youth B gets these items. She reported it was Samaritas’\nfailure, because in August 2022, Case Manager 6 found these\nitems in Youth B’s room. Case Manager 6 asked Staff 3 to retrieve\nthe items and place them in the staff office’s file drawer.\nStaff 3 reported, in regard to there being a video of her buying\nBlack and Mild cigarettes, she purchased them for her husband.\nHer husband wanted them and he wanted a vape as he has them\nat home.

    "• Reported living at the IL house from 1/3/2022 to sometime\nin September of 2022 and Staff 3 was employed there the\nentire time Youth D resided there.\n• Stated Staff 3 has a disability and so a lot of the girls would\npick on her.\n• Youth D stated Staff 3 would take them to the store and\nbuy them food with Staff 3’s own money.

    "Youth C\nYouth C reported on the Thursday or Friday before Youth A’s\nAWOL, she told PD 2 a staff person was about to help Youth A\nAWOL. Youth C said the staff thinks she’s a joke and so, PD 2\nreplied to her telling her this information was “okay, have fun”.\nYouth C said she had reported to PD 2 that the staff who was\nworking at the time that she was talking with PD 2 was the staff\nwho was going to help Youth A. She said Staff 3 was the staff\nworking at that time, but she did not specifically say to PD 2 that it\nwas Staff 3 who was going to help the youth leave.\nYouth A, Youth B, and Youth C\nAll of these youths reported that Youth C was left at the IL house\nalone while Staff 3, Youth A, and Youth B went to the bus station.\nPD 2\nPD 2 reported certain protocols were not followed by staff. He\nreported Staff 4 told him when she arrived for her 11:00PM shift\n(on the night/day of the incident) Staff 3 told her Youth A was in\nher room. PD 2 reported “the protocol is to do a check of all\nrooms to ensure all the girls are there” but Staff 4 did not. Staff 4\nwent with what Staff 3 reported to her.\nPD 2 reported the protocol for when a staff is leaving the home to\ntake a youth somewhere is to text him to say they are leaving the\nhouse. He reported Staff 3 has followed protocol in the past to\nadvise that Staff 3 was taking a youth to an appointment, etc., but\nStaff 3 did not text him about taking Youth B to the store that\nevening. PD 2 did not know why Staff 3, or others, did not follow\nprotocol.\nPD 2 was asked whether he was told by a youth that Youth A was\nplanning to AWOL.

She acknowledged there was a protocol\nwhereby the staff were to text PD2 that they were taking a youth\naway from the facility, but then she reported they don’t have to\ntext PD 2 to say they are taking the youths to the store or a\nmedical appointment or elsewhere. She reported “that was a long\ntime ago.” She did not text PD 2 or Chief Administrator 1 that she\nwas taking Youth B and Youth C away from the IL home.\nAnalysis There were three instances in which the agency failed to follow its\nown policies/procedures/ protocols.\n• The agency policy is that youths are not to be left alone\nduring the hours of 3:00PM-7:00AM.

    "summary": "A staff member (Staff 3) at a Samaritas independent living home in Flint assisted a 17-year-old youth (Youth A) to run away by driving her to a bus station, helped her evade surveillance cameras, and later attempted to bribe another youth to keep quiet. The investigation also substantiated that Staff 3 repeatedly purchased cigarettes, vape pens, alcohol, and marijuana for multiple youths in the home. The agency itself was found non-compliant for failing to follow its own supervision policies, including staff not conducting required room checks and not reporting when youths were taken off-site. The evidence clearly shows Staff 3 was primarily culpable for the direct harm and violations, while agency management shares blame for inadequate oversight and procedural failures.",

  "sir_violation_level": {
    "level": "severe",
    "justification": "The report substantiates multiple severe violations aligning with 'Safety and Violence' and 'Environmental or supervision failures' criteria. Staff 3 actively assisted a youth in running away (AWOL) by transporting her to a bus station, which constitutes a serious safety risk and a supervision failure. Furthermore, Staff 3 purchased cigarettes, vape pens, alcohol, and marijuana for multiple youths, directly contributing to substance use and creating unsafe conditions. The agency also failed to follow its own supervision protocols, leaving a youth alone during prohibited hours. These are not minor policy lapses; they are actions that directly endangered youth safety and well-being."
