Parent A did not answer, but she called Foster Care\nWorker back then hung up. She then sent a text message to\nFoster Care Worker stating she wasn’t going to the visit because\nFoster Care Worker is “a pedophile rapist” and because Parent A\nis “such a bad person.”\nFoster Care Worker reported Parent A recently told her she had\nlice, so Foster Care Worker had to tell Parent A’s psychiatrist\nParent A could not attend an appointment. Foster Care Worker\nreported to the court Parent A had not completed her\npsychological testing and that it was rescheduled.
