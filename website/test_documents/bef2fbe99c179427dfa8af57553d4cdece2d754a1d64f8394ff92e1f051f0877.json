    "04/21/2021 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nOn 3/03/21, youth sexually assaulted another youth at facility by attempting to pull\ndown youth's pants and touch youth's penis. The following day, youth got on top of\nyouth in the hallway once more and was attempting to bite youth's penis. Youth were\nseparated after the second incident.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe full complaint that was received reads as follows:\nOn the night of 04/03/2021, Resident A sexually assaulted Resident\nB. Resident A attempted to pull down Resident B's pants and touch his private\n(meaning penis). The next day Resident A was in his bedroom and Resident B\nwas in the hallway near Resident A's bedroom. Resident A snuck out of his\nbedroom into the hallway with Resident B, out of staff sight. Staff member came\ndown the hall to find Resident A getting off the top of Resident B. Resident A\nwas on top of Resident B and attempted to bite his private (meaning\npenis). Resident A has been moved to a different unit and the boys are now\nseparated.\nOn 04/04/2021, Resident B came out of his room and went to staff member Staff\n1 and told her the night before Resident A tried to pull down his pants and tried\nto touch his privates, while in the hallway out of staff sight. Later Resident B got\nmad and stormed down the hallway another peer went to go after Resident B,\nhowever staff stopped the child. Resident B was found in the hallway with\nResident A. Resident A was in the process of getting off Resident B. Resident\nA was supposed to be in his room. Resident A and Resident B were told to go\nback to where staff are. Resident B then asked to talk to Staff 1 again.\nResident B told Staff 1 that the same thing happen however this time Resident A\nwas on top of him and tried to bite his privates (meaning penis). Resident A has\nbeen moved to a different unit and the boys are now separated.\nI interviewed Staff 3 by phone in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist on\n4/7/2021. He reports not being aware of the allegations but did report that staff are\ntrained to keep residents in a “line-of-site” at all times. He also reports that is critical\nif there are two residents in a hallway at the same time.\nI interviewed Administrator 2 at the facility with the DHHS Specialist on\n4/8/2021. She reports not being fully aware of the allegations but that she will\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "provide all requested documentation. She was given a list of required documentation\nand she indicated it will be sent as soon as possible. She also reports that all staff\nare trained to provide “line-of-site” when supervising residents. She stated, “if a\nresident goes down a hallway, staff are trained to follow”. She reported that the\nfacility received a variance for staffing because of the difficulty in keeping staff during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. She also reported that this variance involved a change in\nthe staffing ratio from 1:2 to 1:3 on the C unit through 4/6/21.\nI interviewed Resident A at the facility with the DHHS Specialist on 4/8/2021.\nHe reports moving to B Unit a “couple of weeks” ago but was unable to identify the\nreason for this move. He also reported that he began his stay at the facility on the B\nUnit but was moved to the C Unit before being replaced to the B unit. He denied\ndoing any behaviors as indicated in the allegations and reported that he never\nleaves his room at night with the exception to use the bathroom. He stated, “no kid\nhas touched me or tried to pull my pants down”. He also reported knowing Resident\nB and described him as his “BFF” (best friend forever). He denied talking to Staff 1\nabout the allegations. He ended by reporting that staff are always watching the\nresidents and that he feels safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Resident B at the facility with the DHHS Specialist on 4/8/2021.\nResident B reports that Resident A was “trying to do something I don’t like” and it\n“happened in the morning and at night”. He also reported that Resident A “tried to do\nthe same thing both times” and both times it happened in the “same hallway, in the\nback area”. He stated, “Resident A was already in the hallway and staff were in the\nmilieu area. Staff are supposed to be watching us all the time.” He reports that he\ntold Staff 1 right after both incidents occurred. He also reports that the first time\noccurred “before and after bedtime” and the second time occurred the next day\n“after lunch”. He reported that residents are not allowed in each other’s bedroom and\nthat he has never gone in another resident’s bedroom. He did report that residents\nare allowed to leave their rooms after bedtime for “snacks or to use the bathroom”.\nHe ended by reporting that Resident A was moved from the C Unit after the incident\noccurred and he now feels safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility with the DHHS Specialist on 4/8/2021. She\nreports working on the C Unit when the second incident occurred and that she is\naware of the allegations. She also reported that Resident B told her that “Resident A\nhad grabbed his balls and other privates in the little hallway” the evening before. She\nreported that Resident B told her that when the first incident occurred the evening\nbefore, she had asked him where the staff were, and he told her that two of them\nwere “in the office with the door propped open”. She reported that Supervisor 1 and\nStaff 2 were the staff working the evening the first incident was to have occurred.\nShe reported that the second incident occurred the next day while she was working\non the C Unit. She also reports that she didn’t see the incident occur. She described\nthe situation at the time the incident was to have occurred.\nIt was around 11:00 am and it was free time. The kids wanted to watch television\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "so I was hooking up the staff computer to the television so they could watch a\nDisney+ movie. One of the kids was walking the halls and Resident B was\nwalking the loop. Resident A was in his room, but I didn’t see him come out of his\nroom. Staff 4 went down one hall, and I went down the other hall, but we never\nsaw what Resident B told me later had happened. We didn’t see what occurred\nbetween Resident A and Resident B, but Resident C said that he saw it and he\ntold me that Resident A was holding Resident B down and trying to grab his\nprivates. All of this occurred within two minutes.\nStaff 1 was asked about supervision of residents and she stated, “I don’t believe that\nstaff need to move to different locations as long as the kid is walking the halls.” She\nalso stated, “we have mirrors in the corners of the hallway”. She was asked about\nResident A being allowed to be in the bedroom in the back hallway and she stated, “I\nthink it was miscommunication between staff that allowed that to happen” because\nResident A has been sneaking lately”. She reports telling Administrator 1 that\nResident A should not be in that specific bedroom because of his behaviors towards\nothers. She also reported that a few days earlier Resident A had gotten a staff “in a\nchoke hold in the back hallway”. She reported the incident and Resident B’s account\nto her supervisor who told her to complete an incident report. She was asked about\nchecking on a resident when they go to their room and she reports that staff will\ncheck but are “not required to do a room check log unless they are sleeping”. She\nended by reporting that Resident A was moved to the B Unit sometime after her shift\nended that day.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 at the facility with the DHHS Specialist on\n4/8/2021. She reported being aware of the allegations and that the facility does not\nhave a written policy of staff keeping residents in a line-of-site. She also reported\nthat staff know they should have a line-of-site with residents and that the facility has\ndiscussed “posting staff” at the end of the hallway involved in the allegations. She\nadmitted that staff were not providing the appropriate supervision which allowed the\nincident to occur. Administrator 1 was asked about this specific room and she stated,\n“we try to keep this room open because of its location”. She reported that Resident A\n“manipulated his way into the room”. She also reported that there was\nmiscommunication and Resident A lied to staff “saying he had permission” to use the\nbedroom.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility with the DHHS Specialist on 4/8/2021. He\nreports working on C unit the night that the first incident is alleged to have occurred.\nHe also reports knowing nothing about the incident. He reported that there were two\nstaff for five kids that shift (2:30-10:00 pm). He also reported that the residents like to\n“gather in the back hallway” but that he is “always getting the kids away from the\nhallway”. He gave the same report about line-of-site supervision as Administrator 1.\nI interviewed Resident C at the facility with the DHHS Specialist on 4/8/2021.\nHe reported “I don’t want to talk about it, I told Staff 1 about it already”. Although he\nrefused to talk about the incident, he did report that it took place in the hallway and\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "Resident A has since been moved from the unit.\nI interviewed Staff 4 by phone with the DHHS Specialist on 4/12/2021. She\nreports “knowing about the allegations”, and that she was working on the C unit the\nday the second allegations took place. She gave a similar report to Staff 1’s report of\nthe incident. She did report that she knew Resident A was in his room and only went\nto check on the hallway when Resident C went into the hallway. She reported\nknowing that Resident B was also in the hallway and she knew that they “can’t have\ntwo kids in the hallway by themselves”. She also reported that Resident A was in the\nprocess of sitting up and Resident B was laying on the floor when she observed\nthem in the hallway. Staff 4 was asked about her responsibility of supervision of\nresidents, and she reported, “no one ever taught us that we had to have line-of-site\non kids. We were never told that not having eyes on a kid was inappropriate”. She\nalso reported that she was never told that Resident A had issues with acting out.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 by phone with the DHHS Specialist on 4/12/2021.\nShe reports working on the C unit the night of the first allegations but not being\naware of the reported incident taking place. She did report that Resident A kept\ncoming out of his room and Resident B did walk a few laps during the shift. She also\nreports that staff are required to watch Residents when they walk laps and staff will\nposition themselves so they can observe them at all times. She gave the same\nreport about being taught about line-of-site as did Administrator 1 and Staff 2. She\nalso reported that she will not allow a resident in the back hallway without\nsupervision.\nDocuments reviewed:\nPersonnel records of Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 4, and Supervisor 1. I reviewed\npersonnel files of the four staff present at the time of the allegations. There is no\ndocumented disciplinary action taken with these staff with the exception of Staff 4.\nDocumentation provided indicates that Staff 4 missed the “deadline date for annual\ntraining completion”. This just occurred and the facility is in the process of\ndeveloping disciplinary action. The four staff have documentation of completing all of\nthe required trainings and orientation.\nPolicy/Procedures. I reviewed the Supervision policy/procedure for the facility.\nThey presented a policy tilted, “Staff to Resident Ratio”. This document focused\nmore on the ratios for staff and what actions staff must take when a resident is on a\n1:1 ratio. This document also explains what actions staff must provide when the\nresident is out of their line of site. This involved the random variable room checks\noutlined in the licensing rules. At the time of the writing of this report, the facility has\nprovided the following document for the direct supervision of residents. This new\ndocument is titled, “Resident Supervision Guideline”. This document states, “In the\nmilieu staff will have residents in their line of sight at all times.”\nIncident reports. I reviewed the incident reports documented for the allegations.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "The facility presented five incident reports which all documented the allegations\nreported. Two of the incident reports reviewed were written by Staff 1 and three were\nwritten by Staff 4. Four of the documents described the second incident outlined in\nthe allegations and one described the first incident. The descriptions matched their\ninterviews.\nFunctional Behavior Assessment. The behavioral assessment for Resident A was\nreviewed and documentation outlined his functioning level, diagnosis, medication,\ntarget behaviors, preventive strategies, responses to challenging behavior,\nreinforcement, and justification for intrusive measures. The target behaviors section\nidentifies “physical aggression and maintaining the personal space of others” as\nareas of concern.\nVariance for staffing ratio. I reviewed the approval for the staffing ratio change and\nit is documented in an email dated 3/25/21 from the Manager of the State foster care\nprogram. The facility was granted the variance due to the difficulty of keeping staff\nwith the COVID-19 issue.\nTeam Meeting minutes. I reviewed several team meeting minutes starting on\n8/4/20 and ending on 2/25/21. This documentation does not list the staff present until\n1/5/21 at which point they list the different staff for each unit. Staff 1 was not part of\nthe facility during this time frame and Staff 4 is documented as attending team\nmeetings on 1/5/21 to 1/7/21. The staff meeting minutes do document the need for\ndirect supervision of Resident A beginning on 1/5/21 and it is also documented\nduring this meeting that all staff need to have “eyes on at all times”. There is no\nother documentation of supervision being a topic of discussion during these team\nmeetings.\nSafety Plans for Resident A and Resident B. I reviewed the safety plans the\nfacility developed for the two residents involved in the allegations. Each youth has a\nspecific safety plan designed for their individual needs. The first part of each safety\nplan addresses staff’s responsibility for supervision and what aspects of supervision\nare expected of them. The second aspect of the plan is “staff documentation and\ncommunication” which indicates the pattern of communication, so all staff are aware\nof the issues and level of supervision required. The third aspect of the plans is the\n“treatment” of each resident. This involves “areas being addressed, triggers,\nprecursors, and calming techniques. The fourth aspect involves “staff interventions\nfor escalated behaviors.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews and written\ndocumentation do support the allegations of staff not providing\nthe appropriate level of supervision for residents in their care. By\nstaff’s report there was approximately 2 to 3 minutes of\nunsupervised time for Resident A and Resident B in the back\nhallway in which the incident took place. Both staff present at\nthis time did not present as understanding the importance of\neyes on and line-of-site as primary supervision conditions. Other\nstaff interviewed did report that this area of the unit must be\nmonitored and have a staff present whenever a resident goes to\nthe area.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe facility should develop strong documentation and training\nmaterials for staff in the area of supervision of residents. There\nshould be a refresher course of supervision on a regular basis\nand supervision should be a topic at all staff meetings. The\nadministration should promote an environment of line-of-site\nwith a focus of treatment rather than just being present for all\nstaff. Staff should have a clear understanding of the needs of\nthe residents and the issues that they could present.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2019C0223060 dated 9/3/2019 with an approved CAP on\n10/7/2019.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
