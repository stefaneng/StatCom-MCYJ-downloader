Program Manager 1 stated there was no staff\nimmediately present to let Youth A into the house as Youth A was\nthe only youth at the time and they did not know when Youth A\nwas planning to return to the house. Program Manager 1 stated a\nkey to the house is kept in a lockbox outside and youth are given\nthe code to get the key out when/if this type of situation would\noccur.

Program Manager 1 confirmed Youth A\nwas able to contact staff and gain access to the house.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 by telephone on 3/15/2024.\nFoster Care Worker 1 stated Youth A had contacted Foster Care\nWorker 1 at the time of the incident. Foster Care Worker 1 stated\nYouth A used facetime on Youth A's phone to show Foster Care\nWorker 1 the key and the lock box referenced by Program\nManager 1.

Foster Care Worker 1 reported Youth A was not at\nthe house the night before and Youth A is not at the house very\noften.\nI interviewed Youth A by telephone on 5/3/2024. Youth A\ndescribed the incident similar to the reports by Program Manager\n1 and Foster Care Worker 1. Youth A confirmed staff did\neventually arrive to let Youth A into the house. Youth A stated that\ntype of situation does not currently happen as there are more\nyouth in the house to let each other in if staff is not present.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the contract document for this program.
