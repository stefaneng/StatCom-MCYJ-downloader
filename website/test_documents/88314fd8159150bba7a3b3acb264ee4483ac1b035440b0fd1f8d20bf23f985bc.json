He\nstressed that Bethany Services has lied about him several times in\ncourt and when he tries to defend himself, he is not allowed to\nspeak. He stated he does not have a chance to speak and when\nhe does tries to speak, he gets cut off. He stated he has\ncompleted and followed all court orders. He stated he would like\nto move his case from Bethany Services because they haven’t\n2",
    "done anything to assist him in getting his children back home.\nWhen I asked, did he have any specific ways Bethany Services\ndid not assist him, he did not identify any specific ways he did not\nreceive help from the agency. He stated Bethany Services is\ntrying to terminate his rights. He stated the last time they lied\nabout him was during a Team Decision Making Meeting (TDM)\nthat occurred on March 28, 2024, whereby Bethany Services\nalleged he was drinking beer during the meeting. He explained\nthere was an old beer can in the background during the meeting,\nbut he was not drinking from the beer can. He stated he did not\npay the beer can any attention because he was trying to listen to\nwhat was being said about his case. Father made the statement\nthat he discussed drinking beer with the DHHS Private Agency\nFoster Care (PAFC) Monitor Supervisor and was told drinking\nbeer was okay on occasions. He said, therefore, on occasions, he\ndrinks beer. He stated he is currently living with his girlfriend and\nthe agency has not requested to come to the home to complete a\nhome study.\nPAFC Monitor Supervisor was interviewed via video\nconference on April 8, 2024. He stated he was aware of the\nFather’s case, and he had spoken to Father on several occasions.\nHe stated as a matter of fact the Father had gone up the chain of\ncommand speaking with people regarding his case. He stated he\nwas aware that Bethany Services was asking for permanency for\nadoption and wanted to terminate the parental rights due to the\nlength of time the children had been removed from the home. He\nstated the Father was very frustrated with Bethany Services. He\nstated what he knows of the case regarding the Father is from\nFebruary 8, 2024, when he reviewed the court order. Father had\nestablished housing and was living with his sister temporarily, but\nit was not adequate space to bring his three children to the home.\nHe stated at the time, Bethany Services had not completed a\nhome study of the home because Bethany Services was not sure\nif this was going to be the Father’s permanent location. He stated\nhe believed Bethany Services was also requesting the Father’s\nname be placed on the rental agreement. He said based on his\nperspective, the Father did not need to show proof he was on the\nrental agreement to show he had adequate space. He stated to\nhis knowledge Father was attending therapy and was doing drug\nscreens three times a week. He said the drug screens were\nincreased to see if he was doing drugs. The PAFC Monitor\nSupervisor stated he was not at the TDM on March 28, 2024, so\nhe did not observe a beer can. He stated Father discussed the\nbeer can situation with him. He stated Father is very open and\nforthcoming with his discussion and answers. He stated\n3",
    "historically Father does not have a record of drinking. He said in\nhis opinion, the children have been removed from the Father’s\ncare for over two years and this does have an impact on the\nchildren’s return home due to the length of time.\nThe PAFC Monitor Supervisor stated he looked at Father’s case\nand noted Father was following his parenting classes, income was\nin compliance, substance abuse was compliant and so was his\ntherapy attendance. He stated Father was not in compliance with\nhis housing and sex offender registry. The PACF Monitor\nSupervisor said Father has not registered his living location on the\nsex offender registry in Michigan.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed on April 8, 2024, via\nvideo conference. She stated Bethany Services top\nadministrators have sat down with Father and discussed his case.\nShe stated that Father attends the services provided to him, but\nhe does not benefit from the services and there is a lack of\nprogress. She stated Bethany Services has done everything they\ncould do to work with Father and address his concerns, but he\nbecomes very argumentative and refuses to listen to reason.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed on April 8,\n2024, via video conference. She stated she was assigned this\ncase due to its complexity and the last foster care worker leaving\nthe agency. She stated regarding Father’s court order, he has\ncompleted the majority of the services but there is a lack of benefit\nshown from the services he was provided. She stated despite\ncompleting anger management/domestic violence classes Father\ncontinues to have a pattern of domestic violence. She stated he\nwas arrested/charged with assault multiple times throughout this\ncase and most recently being 10/2023 which Bethany Services\nwas just made aware of on 3/27/2024 after a quarterly background\ncheck. She stated Father continues to lack benefit based on his\ncommunication with the agency specifically when he is not in\ncontrol of a situation and this behavior has occurred in front of the\nchildren.\nThe FCS stated Bethany Services has concerns with Father’s\nalcohol use which he denies being an issue. She stated after\ncompleting services at a treatment facility, it was\nrecommended/discussed by the treatment facility that Father\nparticipates in Pathways to Recovery due to him testing positive\nfor alcohol on drug screens while attending the program. The\nFCS said this has not been completed. She stated Father\nreported to Bethany Services he has been successfully\n4",
    "discharged from the treatment facility and that is what matters.\nShe stated Father tested positive for alcohol on a couple of drug\nscreens with Bethany Services as recently as February 2024.\nFCS stated Father was observed drinking out of a bud light can, at\nthe TDM that was completed on March 28, 2024. She stated\nFather denied this and stated to her that it was an empty can in\nthe background.\nFCS stated Father needs appropriate housing. He is currently\nliving with a girlfriend. FCS stated the concern is from a prior\nDHHS report concerning Father’s domestic violence. She stated\nher concern with this current home with the girlfriend is if this is a\nstable home environment given that he is not on the lease and\nhas no legal authority over the home. She stated the children do\nnot know this girlfriend or have been around her. FCS stated a\nhome study of the girlfriend’s home would be completed on April\n21, 2024, as her background check/fingerprints has been\ncompleted.\nFCS stated Bethany Services provided Father with all necessary\nreferrals. She stated he was provided documents to verify any\nnon-compliances such as missed/positive drug screens, court\nreports, and documents from service providers. She stated\nBethany Services attempted to assist Father with rent payments\nback in December of 2023, but he denied the assistance because\nthe rent was over three months past due. FCS said the children\nwere in the process of being returned to Father at that time, but he\ndid not have stable housing. FCS stated Bethany Services has\ncontinued to provide Family Team Meetings/Team Decision\nmaking Meetings (FTM/TDM’s) any time Father has requested\none to assist him with any needed requests/referrals.\nFCS stated Father was in the Parent Partner Program until his\nincarceration in October 2022. She stated prior to Father’s\nincarceration he received an extension for the services due to her\nrequest.
