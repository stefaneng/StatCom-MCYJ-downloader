At a\nholiday function at the facility in 2019 Resident A introduced Staff Person\n1 to her stating that he was “in love with her” which concerned Referral\nSource. She reports Staff Person 1 exhibited extra attention to Resident A\nduring the gathering and would speak with him often. Referral Source\nstates Staff Person 1 and other staff have stated that they loved her\nbrother, but that Staff Person 1’s statement concerned her noting that\nStaff Person 1 is just “too friendly” with him. Referral Source learned of\nResident A and Staff Person 1’s communications after a home visit when\nResident A did not log off his Instagram account through her cell phone.\nReferral Source has not observed Resident A and Staff Person 1 together,\nhas not seen Staff Person 1 at her residence, and does not believe there\nhas been any sexual contact.\nResident A was interviewed onsite by Detective and Chief Administrator on\n04/20/2020.
