    "Four of six foster care cases did not meet this requirement.\nFile one: 12/1/20 PATP did not have the parent signature and the foster parent did\nnot sign within 30 days. 3/1/21 PATP did not have the parent or foster parent\nsignatures. 5/28/21 and 8/26/21 PATPs were missing one parent signature.\nFile two: 6/15/21 PATP did not have the foster parent’s signature.\nFile three: 5/6/21 PATP had a late caregiver signature on 6/28/21.\nFile four: 1/2/21 PATP did not have the parent’s signatures.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Parent Agency Treatment Plan Signatures: One service plan had\ndocumented in case contacts that a parent’s whereabouts were unknown.\nThe agency was advised to also document this information on the PATP\nsignature line.\n Medication documentation: One child’s medical passport noted the youth was\nprescribed four psychotropic medications. However, this information was not\nentered into the medical tab in MiSACWIS. The agency reported they are\nunable to edit this tab as the MDHHS Psychotropic Medication Oversight Unit\n(PMOU) is responsible for this information. The agency was advised to\ncontact the PMOU to have this information updated and document attempts\nto have it corrected, as this tab also ties into Informed Consent timeliness and\nreporting.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nA special evaluation was completed by Monroe County DHHS for the Lenawee\nDHHS foster home. The allegation was that the foster parent left a child in the car,\nafter work, into the evening hours. Law Enforcement and DHHS were involved in the\ninvestigation. Upon completion of interviews, it was determined the allegation was\ntrue and happened on more than one occasion. Revocation was recommended and\nis currently pending with the disciplinary action unit of DCWL.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP (approved 12/28/2020) was submitted as a result of the interim review\ndated 11/18/2020. During the 2020 review the agency was cited in thirteen areas.\nDuring this renewal evaluation only seven violations were found. The agency\n7",
    "reported implementing their CAP successfully, as is evident by the significant\nimprovement in several areas. While there were a few repeat violations, the instance\nof each occurrence has decreased, which indicates their previous CAP has been\neffective.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator reported that implementation of the CAP went well as they\nhave not had much turnover with staff this year. Staff have been retrained in some\nareas, processes adjusted, and supervisory follow-up has increased where needed.\nOverall, the Chief Administrator reported that she believed the agency showed\nimprovement from the findings of last year’s review.\nInterviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. Both staff reported facing challenges during this\npast year due to the pandemic and some difficulties with the court system. However,\nboth staff reported feeling supported by the agency and administration and feeling\nthat their needs are recognized and met. Neither staff had any concerns or\nrecommendations for areas in which the agency could improve.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued\na renewal of their regular license.\nSeptember 29, 2021\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 30, 2021\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
