The treatment team does not have\nany members with limited or full licenses of social work or\ncounseling.\n• Suicide Precautions Policy states precautions are initiated\nby the Treatment Team in person or via phone. The\nTreatment Team will interview the youth and determine if\nfurther action is needed based on risk level.\n• Hospital Crisis Screening Procedure states if a resident has\nattempted suicide or there is a serious suicide threat, staff\nwill contact 911 immediately for them to be transported to\nthe hospital. This does not require assessment from the\nTreatment Team.\n• Email dated 8/29/25 authored by Program Manager states\nYouth A attempting to ingest plant-based cleaner is the first\ncomment or attempt made.\nVideo Review:\nVideo footage was reviewed for 7/23/25 at approximately\n1:15PM. Video footage shows Staff 8 opening the cleaning\nsupply closet and Youth A grabbing multiple items from the\ncloset. At 1 minute 22 seconds, Youth A moves out of\nframe and Staff 8 in a yellow shirt is visible appearing to be\ntalking. Upon beginning video clip #2 Youth A and Staff 8\nhave re-entered the frame and are seen both facing the\ncamera with Staff 8 reaching both arms from behind Youth\nA with all four of their hands holding the bottle. At 1 minute\nand 3 seconds Staff 1 enters the frame and then leaves the\nframe again. Staff 1’s right arm is seen reaching for the\n13",
    "bottle from the left. At 2 minutes 22 seconds Supervisor is\nseen entering the hallway, approaches and reaches for the\nbottle. At the start of video clip #3, Youth A, Supervisor,\nand part of Staff 8’s shirt can be seen bending and\nappearing to struggle as they all hold onto the bottle which\nis spilling liquid onto the floor. At 21 seconds the bottle has\nfallen to the floor and Supervisor can be seen walking away\nas Youth A drops to her knees, cups her hands together\nand retrieves liquid from the floor, bringing it to her mouth.\nStaff 8 is seen bending towards Youth A appearing to\nspeak at which time Youth A stops moving but remains\ncrouched down towards the floor. At 37 seconds Youth A\nbegins cupping her hands and scooping liquid off the floor\nand bringing it to her mouth again while Staff 8 attempts to\nblock Youth A’s hands from reaching her mouth, with her\nhands. Youth A then stands up, repositions and gets back\ndown and begins to scoop liquid again without intervention.\nAt 1 minute 16 seconds Youth A stands up and walks down\nthe hall. Staff 8 can be seen using towels to clean up the\nliquid in the hallway.\nAnalysis A rule violation is established regarding this allegation. Per\ninterviews with staff, Supervisor, Program Manager and Youth A,\nit was not the facility’s intention or decision to send Youth A to the\nhospital for evaluation. It was at the recommendation of EMS and\nthe police who were at the scene due to being called for an\nallegation of Youth A assaulting Supervisor. The facility’s\nprocedure states following an attempt of suicide, it is required\nyouth be sent to or taken to the hospital for crisis-screening which\nwas reportedly not the intention of the facility. Several interviews\nstated Youth A had made previous self-harm or suicidal\ncomments and or/gestures in the past including the documented\nincident on 7/22/25.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe facility should revise their Suicide Precautions Policy to\ninclude proper documentation of self-harm ideations, comments,\nand follow-up.\nConsultation:\nIt is recommended that an updated training be created for all staff\nregarding self-harm and suicidal ideation and procedure. This\ntraining should include taking any and all gestures, comments,\nand attempts of self-harm or suicide seriously whether the manner\nof attempt is considered dangerous or effective or not. It is\nrecommended that a licensed clinician make risk determinations\nfor self-harm and suicide. The facility’s Treatment Team does not\npresently include any licensed or limited licensed clinicians.\n14",
