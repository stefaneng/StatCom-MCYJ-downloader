The times listed\non the Third Shift Bed Check documentation was not accurate\nbecause it was prefilled on the form template and did not allow\nstaff to input the time the bed check was actually completed.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n07/17/2025\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 18, 2025\n___________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
