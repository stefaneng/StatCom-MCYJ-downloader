    "ALLEGATION:\nAgency has history of issues regarding agency assessments/recommendations\nregarding licensing evaluations and a history regarding impeding CPS\ninvestigations.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe agency received a central intake notice on 03/08/2021 on Foster Home and\nconducted a joint investigation with another DHHS investigator. Through the course\nof the investigation, it was found that Foster Parent A did not disclose during the\ncompletion of the 3130a, the initial home study or during the renewal evaluation his\nsubstance abuse, use and treatment. Foster Parent B also did not disclose her\nspouse’s substance abuse, use and treatment during the 3130a, initial home study\nor renewal evaluation.\nFoster Parent A had two Good Moral Character convictions, so an Administrative\nReview Team (ART) had to be completed and approved for the home to be licensed.\nThe ART was approved based on the information the family provided during the\ninitial home study. Upon learning the new information that Foster Parent A and\nFoster Parent B withheld during the initial home study, the ART was modified and\ndenied. The agency downplayed the concern of the family withholding information\nregarding Foster Parent A’s substance abuse and use. The agency’s initial\nrecommendation was that the foster home license “continue with an acceptable\ncorrective action plan.” The agency’s recommendation was only changed due to\nDCWL modifying the approved ART to a denial based on information that the family\nwithheld during the 3130a, initial licensure and renewal evaluation.\nIn the special evaluation report, the agency listed an alleged rule violation of Rule\n9206 Foster home evaluation (b) Truthfully assist the agency in determining all of the\nfollowing: (vii) current substance abuse and current treatment yet failed to conclude\nthat a violation was established. By the family’s own admission, during the special\nevaluation, they reported they withheld the current substance abuse and treatment\nof Foster Parent A during the 3130a, the initial licensure and the renewal evaluation.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n Upper Peninsula Family Solutions, Inc. Special Investigation Record\n Michigan Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System\n(MiSACWIS) foster home documentation and special evaluation\ndocumentation.\n Emails\n Another DHHS investigation report dated 04/06/2021\n Upper Peninsula Family Solutions, Inc. Special Evaluation Report dated\n06/11/2021\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12325 License recommendation.\n(1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nappropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained\nin the foster home evaluation and any special evaluations.\nANALYSIS: The agency failed to make a recommendation that was\nappropriate to the findings of the special evaluation. However,\nbased on a review of the agency’s license there is not a history\nof this in the prior two years as alleged.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nIn a review of the foster home documentation in MiSACWIS (Michigan Statewide\nAutomated Child Welfare Information System) the agency sent the CWL-259 ten\nworking days after learning of the special evaluation, instead of within five working\ndays. The special evaluation intake date was 03/08/2021 and the CWL-259 was\nsubmitted to the Department of Child Welfare Licensing on 03/19/2021.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in\nthe agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(a) Submit a special investigation record to the\ndepartment's licensing authority within 5 working days in\nthe manner prescribed by the department.\nANALYSIS: The agency did not submit the CWL-259 within five working\ndays as required by policy.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2018C0102031 dated 06/07/2019\nCorrective Action Plan approved 06/10/2019\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, the recommendation is to\ncontinue the current license status.\nJuly 6, 2021\n________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 10, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
