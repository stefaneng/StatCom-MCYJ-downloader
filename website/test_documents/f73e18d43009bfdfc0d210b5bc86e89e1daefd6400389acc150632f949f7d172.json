    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 put Youth A in a headlock and held her by her braids after\nyouth fell to the floor. Two staff pulled Staff 1 off of Youth A.\nYouth A did not sustain any injuries.\nInvestigation Video\nVideo shows Youth A throwing chairs at the wall. Staff 1 and\nTeam Leader initiate a two-person control hold with Team Leader\non her right side and Staff 1 on her left. The staffs’ upper bodies\nare in position, but neither are able to gain sufficient leverage of\nthe youth’s lower extremities. Youth A raises her left knee to her\nchin and stomps it down in front of Staff 1 sliding her out of\nposition. Both staff lose hold of the youth’s shoulders. Youth A\nraises her right leg to her chin and maneuvers both staff out of\nposition. Youth A is now in front with both staff. She kicks\nbackward at Team Leader and Team Leader moves away to avoid\nthe blow. Staff 1 raises her left knee to block a kick from Youth A,\nloses her balance and is left holding just a wrist. Youth A gets her\nwrist free and swats at Staff 1’s arm. Staff 1 pivots, grabs Youth\nA’s braids from behind and head locks her. Youth A places her\narms under Staff 1’s right upper thigh and pulls herself and Staff 1\nto the floor. Staff 1 still has ahold of the youth’s braids. Staff 2\nmoves in from behind and helps Staff 1 up from the floor. Then\nshe pulls Staff 1’s arms up and behind her back and separates\nStaff 1 from Youth A.\nInterviews\nThe Complainant was listed as an anonymous staff member.\nHowever, upon interview Team Leader identified herself as\nComplainant.\n2",
    "I notified Youth A’s Foster Care Worker of the investigation, and\nshe expressed no additional concerns.\nI interviewed Youth A jointly with Government Worker 1 on\n2/23/24. She has been at the facility for five months and has been\nrestrained three or four times since admission. On 2/22/24, Youth\nA said “They (staff) tried to restrain me but couldn’t. I slipped out.”\nAs group was ending, she said Staff 1 asked her to sweep the\nfloor. “I couldn’t (sweep) because everybody’s stuff was on the\nfloor. Staff 1 said ‘I don’t give a fuck’ so I started sweeping\neverybody’s stuff. Staff 1 said ‘I don’t give a fuck at this point.’ I\nflipped a table and threw a broom and chair at the wall. Staff 1\nand Team Leader grabbed my waist and tried to restrain me. I\npopped Team Leader’s hand (demonstrating a flicking motion\nusing her thumb and middle finger). Staff 1 said I tried to fight her\nand pulled my hair. (At the time, Youth A was wearing shoulder-\nlength braids) I kicked her. Her phone fell. She swung at me.\nStaff 2 tried to stop Staff 1 from coming after me and her phone…I\nslipped. I was sitting on the floor.”\nAfter the incident, Youth A said her face was red and she had a\n“tiny scratch” above her left eye that was no longer visible. Prior to\nthis incident Youth A said she and Staff 1 had a decent\nrelationship.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present on 2/27/24. She has worked at the facility for less\nthan six months and was last trained in CPI in August 2023.\nGovernment Worker 1 read the allegation aloud to Staff 1.\nStaff 1 recalled on 2/22/24 it was time for chores and “nobody\nmoved.” She said she asked Youth A to start her assigned chore\nand Youth A asked “How the fuck you think I’m gonna clean up\nwith everybody’s shit here? How ‘bout I just sweep it all?” Staff 1\nadmitted she told Youth A to do whatever she needed to do so\nYouth A swept the girls’ items into a pile. “One youth got mad and\nasked why I didn’t stop Youth A from doing that.”\nStaff 1 continued. “Youth A is known to flip out. She screamed\n‘Shut the fuck up’ and flipped a table toward me, picked up chairs\nand flipped a table again. Team Leader and Supervisor were\nthere, not doing anything. Team Leader grabbed Youth A’s right\narm to restrain her. Youth A said, ‘Don’t fucking restrain me’ and\nlooked like she was about to hit Team Leader.” Staff 1 stated that\nshe and Youth A “are close.” “I was trying to do a proper hold. I\nheld an arm and she kicked backward at me. I put my leg in front\n3",
    "of her leg. I did not have her in a headlock. I can’t remember\nwhat everybody else was doing. I let her go. She fell. I tripped\nover her. Staff 2 was there. Nobody was helping. I fell and hurt\nmy wrist. I saw my phone and reached for it. Other staff pulled on\nme. I wanted them to stop touching me. I got my phone…Youth\nA had long braids. I don’t remember pulling her braids. Afterward\nI told Supervisor that I pretty much had her in a headlock. Youth\nA tore my observation sheets and clipboard. She took my jacket\nand threw it in the shower and smiled.”\nStaff 1 did not remember cussing at Youth A but said it is possible\nshe did. She admitted “I made a mistake.” It had been six months\nsince Staff 1 was trained in physical management, and she had\nnot used or practiced the holds since orientation training. Staff 1\nsuggested Vista Maria staff be retrained in CPI on a monthly\nbasis.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present. It was her second week on the job when Youth A\nthreatened to “go fucking off!” She said Youth A lipped a table,\ntossed chairs and put holes in the walls with a broom. “Staff 1 and\nTeam Leader restrained her on each side backed up against the\nwall. Youth A was kicking at Team Leader. Staff 1 was not able\nto get positioned from the waist down. Youth A fell and Staff 1 fell\nwith her. I picked Staff 1 up and noticed she had a handful of\nYouth A’s braids. Me and Team Leader told Staff 1 to let go twice.\nI had to pull both Staff 1’s arms behind her and pull her up and\nback from Youth A.”\nStaff 2 said she did not see Staff 1 first grab Youth A’s hair but\n“she had a tight grip.” “We convinced Staff 1 to let go of her hair.\nAfter I pulled Staff 1 off, she asked to get her phone and Team\nLeader handed it to her.”\nI interviewed Team Leader jointly with Government Worker 1 and\nRights Officer present. She has worked at Vista Maria for six\nweeks but has 23 years of experience working in child caring\ninstitutions. Team Leader recalled hearing screaming and seeing\nYouth A throwing chairs and tables, hitting the wall. Youth A said\n“The bitch (directing her anger toward Staff 1) asked me to sweep\nthe floor. I’ll sweep alright.” Team Leader indicated Youth A was\nthrowing items creating an unsafe environment. “We utilized the\ntwo-person (control hold). Staff 1 on the left and me on the right. I\nlooked over and saw Staff 1 had Youth A in a headlock. I told\nStaff 1 to reposition herself. “You cannot hold her like that.” Staff\n1 and Youth A fell to the floor. I disengaged. Me and Staff 2\n4",
    "noticed Staff 1 had Youth A’s hair wrapped around her hand. I\ndirected Staff 1 to let go. She wouldn’t. Staff 2 pulled Staff 1 off.\nWe had Staff 1 go off the wing…”\nTeam Leader said Nurse told her she overheard Staff 1 in the hall\nsay she had Youth A in a headlock. “Youth A refused medical\ncare and told Nurse she was not injured. She refused a body\nchart and debriefing as well. I wrote an incident report and called\nCPS. Staff 1 did swear at Youth A, but I can’t recall exactly what\nshe said.”\nI interviewed Youth M jointly with Government Worker 1. She said\nYouth A “gets mad easily” and was “flipping out.” She made holes\nin the wall with a broomstick and picked up a table. “Staff 1 and\nTeam Leader had to restrain her. Youth A was struggling. They\nfell. Staff 1’s phone fell…That was just their (the staffs’)\njob…Youth A did say to stop grabbing her hair while they were on\nthe floor…Youth A is perfectly fine. Staff 1 left I guess and hasn’t\nreturned.” Asked about how Staff 1 and Youth A related together,\nYouth M said, “Their relationship was fine literally an hour before\nthat,” adding that Staff 1 was “mom” to Youth A and other youths.\nAsked why youths refer to Staff 1 as “mom,” she said “A lot of us\ncall her that. A lot of kids have nowhere to go. Youth get comfy\nwith staff and peers.”\nDocuments Reviewed\nAn incident report dated 2/22/24 by Team Leader indicated Team\nLeader heard commotion on blue wing. Upon entering, Youth A\nwas yelling and had already flipped over a table and thrown\nchairs. Team Leader started moving items off of the wing. A\n“clear the area” was called. Youth A continued throwing chairs at\nthe walls creating an unsafe environment. Team Leader and Staff\n1 placed Youth A in a CPI two-person control hold. Youth A fell to\nthe floor and Team Leader released her. Nurse was on the unit\nwhen this took place and offered medical attention. Youth A\nrefused medical attention and stated she was not injured.\nHer employee record indicates Staff 1 was placed on\nadministrative leave on 2/23/24 and terminated on 3/6/24.\nGovernment Worker 1 deemed Staff 1 unsuitable to work with\nchildren.\nAnalysis Video shows Staff 1 grabbed and held Youth A’s braids and had\nher in a headlock briefly before they both fell to the floor. Staff 2\npulled Staff 1 off of the youth.\n5",
    "CONSULTATION\nStaff should maintain appropriate boundaries with the youths and\ndiscourage them from referring to any staff members as “mom.”\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2024C0001153SI intake 2/15/24; CAP pending\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nMarch 11, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 22, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n6"
