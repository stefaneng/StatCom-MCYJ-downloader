TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Rule 400.12415 (a) Incident reports. Discussed the requirement that\nincident reports are to be submitted to the consultant. Only those incidents\nnamed under the rule are to be submitted.\n• DCWL review of Corrective Action Plans (CAP). The agency was informed\nthat starting January 1, 2024, interim and renewal audit CAP's will be\nreviewed with the agency at three months and six months.

EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe agency was cited for three rule/policy violations during the 11/29/23 Interim\ninspection and an approved corrective action plan was submitted on 12/27/23. The\nviolations were, R 400.12510 Independent living agreement, FOM 722-08D\nTreatment Plans, and FOM 801-03 Medical Passport. The current Renewal\ninspection did not establish repeat violations thus indicating the agency CAP was\nsuccessful in preventing repeat violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrators Annual Assessment was reviewed. The assessment\naddressed rule and policy violations established during the 2023 Interim\nInspection and the agency efforts to correct and prevent repeat violations.\nThe assessment also identified barriers to compliance. They are in part and\nquoted as follows:\n- Tracking was not sufficient via supervisor only as the USP dates are not every 90\ndays when the approval path timeframes are included, thus leading to overdue\nagreements.\n- Confusion on due dates for signatures as staff focused on the USP due date,\nafter approval.\n- Sending out reports a month ahead of time was too far as emergencies and\nother immediate issues arose in foster care.\n- Medical and dental exams for youth that are in SIL or YAVFC that are not willing\nto participate in exams to sign a waiver which is not recognized by policy or\nMISEP.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency is a local DHHS agency and therefore financial records were not\navailable for review.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported that their respective supervisors are supportive of them and are\nknowledgeable about foster care. Staff reported supervisors can offer quality\nsupport and direction regarding concerns or questions workers may have. Staff\nalso reported that they feel they are part of a supportive team which pulls together\nwhen needed to get agency responsibilities completed and provide quality care for\nchildren and families.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is located in a modern, well equipped building in Sault Ste Marie.\nThere is sufficient office space. CHRI documents were observed to be stored\nsecurely.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe CPA Analyst identified three safety alerts during visits to the homes. They are as\nfollows:\nSafety Alert #1. The safety alert was generated on 10/02/24 as firearms were not\nsafely stored. The firearms were without trigger locks and were not stored in a\nmanufactured safe.\nResolution: Resolution was obtained on 10/07/24 as trigger locks were installed and\nthe guns stored in a safe in the master bedroom. Photos of the trigger locked firearms\nwere submitted.\nSafety Alert #2. The safety alert was generated on 10/17/24 as a smoke alarm was\nmissing between the parent bedroom and the rest of the house.\nResolution: Resolution was obtained on 1024/24 as a smoke alarm was installed\nbetween the parent bedroom and the rest of the home. Photos were submitted and\nuploaded.\nSafety Alert #3. The safety alert was generated on 10/22/24 as smoke alarms were\nmissing between the children's bedroom and the rest of the home. A smoke alarm\nwas also missing between the master bedroom and the rest of the room. A smoke\nalarm was missing in the basement.\nResolution: At the time of this audit and report, resolution has not yet been obtained.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nNovember 21, 2024\n_____________________________________\nDouglas Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 22, 2024\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
