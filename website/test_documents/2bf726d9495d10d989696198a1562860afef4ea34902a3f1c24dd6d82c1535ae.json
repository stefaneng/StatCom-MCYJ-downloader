    "Allegation Staff use derogatory language with youth and threaten to kick\nyouth out of placement or intimidate youth if they call CPS. Staff\nhave been racist against African American youth.\nInvestigation On 3/24/22 DCWL received the allegations made by a youth at the\nfacility. The allegations included additional information regarding\nmeals, clothing, and transportation at the facility. Those issues\nwere not investigated, as they are not required services from an\nIndependent Living Program (ILP).\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the ILP house on 3/27/22.\nYouth A reported that staff intentionally do things to get youth\nkicked out of the house. Youth A discussed an incident where\nYouth C went out and left her child with a peer. Youth C was told\nby staff that she cannot leave her child. Youth A was upset\nbecause she felt staff could not tell a Youth C how to parent her\nchild. Youth A and others were angry, yelling at staff, and wrote on\nthe white board in the common area. Youth A stated she wanted\nto make a report to Children’s Service so all of the staff would be\nfired. Youth A reported that Supervisor gave her the number to\ncontact Children’s Services. When asked what staff had done that\nspecifically involved derogatory language, threats, intimidation or\nracism, Youth A could not provide examples. Youth A complained\nabout staff not providing transportation, clothing, and food. Youth\nA was advised of the expectations of Independent Living and\ninformed that ILP are not required to provide those items. Youth A\nstated she did not like any of the food there and believed the “P” in\nILP meant “plus” as in, staff are supposed to provide everything\nyouth want and take youth wherever they want. This seemed to be\nthe source of Youth A’s anger, as she felt the agency was not\ndoing what she thought they should. Youth A reported she did not\nhave any examples of what was alleged but had heard information\nfrom another youth that she believed was “kicked out” of the\nprogram for complaining. Youth A felt she should make a report\nsince the youth is no longer there. An investigation (SIR\n2022C0212020) was previously completed regarding this youth,\nwith no violations found. When asked again about any staff\nparticipating in what was alleged, Youth A stated that she typically\nsees Supervisor, Staff 1, and Staff 2. Youth A reported things she\ndid not like about those staff, but she did not provide any specifics\nregarding the allegation. Youth A reported she refused to speak\nwith any of the staff to discuss her concerns.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the ILP house on 3/27/22.\nYouth B reported she was aware of the allegation as she heard\nrumors. Youth B indicated there was an incident recently where\n2",
    "youth were upset about Youth C getting in trouble for going out\nand leaving her baby with another youth. Youth A, Youth C, and\nYouth D were “riled up” at the house that night and threatening to\ncall Children’s Services on the agency. The youth reportedly felt\nthe agency did not have a right to tell Youth C how to parent her\nchild. Youth B stated she was not part of the incident and had not\nwitnessed any incidents of staff speaking inappropriately to youth,\nmaking threats, or discriminating toward anyone. Youth B verified\nthat staff made the Children’s Services number available to youth.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the ILP house on 3/27/22.\nYouth C was still upset with the agency about the incident that\nhappened a few nights prior. Youth C felt the agency did not have\nthe right to tell her how to parent her baby. Youth C was asked\nabout the allegation but she did not provide any information\nspecific to what was reported. Youth C stated that she believed\nstaff were supposed to provide youth with everything they need for\nthemselves and their babies. It was explained to Youth C what the\nIL rule requirements are for the agency and what is expected of\nthe youth. Regarding the allegation, Youth C stated she believed\nstaff were bribing white youth to be on their side, which she felt\nwas racist. Youth C reported that one white youth was called to\nthe staff offices on the night of the incident, and the other youth\nbelieved staff were trying to bribe that youth not to help the other\nyouth that were upset. Youth C did not have any specific\ninformation about bribes from staff.\nYouth D was interviewed face-to-face at the ILP house on 3/27/22.\nYouth D was aware of the allegations and did not have any\nspecific information regarding them. Youth D reported frustrations\nabout staff not paying to get her phone fixed and other issues that\nare not requirements for IL staff. Youth D stated that Supervisor is\nrude and unreasonable. Citing that Supervisor has called law\nenforcement when a youth did not return to the house. Youth D\nfelt that was unnecessary. Youth D felt the agency was “corrupt”\nbut did not have any examples other than hearsay about why\nanother youth left the program. Youth D stated that Supervisor\ntries to tell the youth what to do. Youth D stated she believes\nSupervisor does this in an attempt to upset youth and make them\nleave the program. Youth D stated that Supervisor once\nthreatened to kick a peer out. Upon further questioning, it was\ndetermined this was hearsay.\nYouth E was interviewed face-to-face at the ILP house on 3/27/22.\nYouth E reported that staff handled the incident with Youth C\ninappropriately. Youth E also reported being upset that staff tell\n3",
    "youth how to care for their babies. Youth E stated that when she\nvoiced her concerns to Supervisor, Youth E was told she was\nbeing disrespectful. Youth E stated that she was about to be\nkicked out of the program for being disrespectful. Youth E stated\nshe has not observed staff to yell or swear at youth. Youth E\nreported Supervisor lies about everything and youth do not like\nher “tone of voice”. When asked for an example, Youth E reported\nthat Supervisor lied about small things that do not matter; but\ncould not provide an example. Youth E did not observe any\ninstances of swearing, threatening, or discriminating against\nyouth.\nSupervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the ILP house on\n3/27/22. Supervisor denied any use of derogatory language or\nswearing at youth. Supervisor denied being part of or observing\nany racial discrimination toward youth. Supervisor denied\nthreatening to kick youth out of placement. However, she reported\nthat at times youth have stated they did not like the program and\nwanted to leave. Supervisor told youth they are not required to\nstay there, unlike residential, and youth can contact their DHHS\nworker to discuss other options. Supervisor denied participating in\nor observing any intimidation of youth that wished to contact\nChildren’s Services. Supervisor reported that she and all staff\nprovide youth with information to call in a complaint if they wish.\nSupervisor reported there are ongoing issues with rumors among\nthe youth. Whenever a youth leaves the program, the rumor\nseems to spread that the youth was kicked out. As staff cannot tell\nthe youth the reason for peers leaving, they have difficulty\nstopping the rumors. For example, Youth E will be leaving the\nprogram at the request of her probation officer. However, word\nhas already spread that she was “kicked out” because of the\nrecent situation with Youth C.\nChief Administrator was interviewed face-to-face at the ILP house\non 3/27/22. Although Chief Administrator is not present in the\nhouse every day, she noted that she has not observed any\nintimidation, profanity, threats, or discrimination by staff, toward\nyouth. Chief Administrator reported no concerns about\nSupervisor’s interactions with youth. Neither Supervisor, Staff 1\nnor Staff 2 have any disciplinary action on file regarding any\nbehavior implied in the allegations.\nStaff 1 was interviewed by phone on 4/5/23. Staff 1 reported\nworking in the ILP home on an almost daily basis. Staff 1 was\nfamiliar with all youth of the home, and aware of the complaint.\nStaff 1 denied ever observing or participating in swearing, yelling,\n4",
    "threatening, or racial discrimination. Staff 1 reported she had\npreviously provided the number for Children’s Services to youth\nthat wished to make a complaint. This is the standard practice for\nstaff. Staff 1 did not have any concerns regarding Supervisor.\nStaff 1 had not observed Supervisor to act inappropriately with\nyouth. Staff 1 stated she believed it was common for complaints to\nbe about the person in charge, as it was easy for youth to blame\nthat person when youth did not get their way. Staff 1 noted that\nSupervisor is on-site more frequently lately. Previously, it may\nhave been easier for youth to do what they wanted, when\nSupervisor was not around. Now that she has more of a presence,\nthey may be frustrated by the consistency and expectations that\nare set.\nStaff 2 was interviewed by phone on 4/5/23. Staff 2 reported\nworking in the ILP home regularly. Staff 2 was familiar with all\nyouth of the home. Staff 2 denied ever hearing or participating in\nyelling, swearing, threatening, or racial discrimination. Staff 2\nreported providing contact information to youth that wished to\ncontact DCWL or Children’s Services. Staff 2 did not have any\nconcerns about the way Supervisor interacts with youth. Staff 2\nindicated that youth seem to focus their frustration at Supervisor,\nas she is the person in charge.\nDocuments\n• A photograph was taken of the dry erase board located in a\ncommon area of the house. On the night the complaint was\nmade, Youth A and two others wrote several statements\nabout staff on the board, which they labeled “hate chart”.\nThe board was covered in racial comments, derogatory\nremarks, and threats toward staff. The less offensive\nmessages included, “finna lose yall jobs”, “need to leave\nand get fired”, “erase it and I’m calling CPS”, “I promise to\nget yall fired”, “I’m calling CPS on you (Supervisor, Staff 1\nand Staff 2) so this whole place can get investigated and\nshut down”, “This place getting shut down”, “CPS watching\nyall, I’m telling everything”.\n• The youth’s case files were reviewed in MiSACWIS on\n3/24/22. No information relevant to the investigation was\nfound.\n• The agency’s prior investigations were reviewed on\n3/24/22. No prior violations of this rule were found.\nAnalysis Based on interviews completed with youth and staff, no violation\nwas found.\nTechnical Assistance\n5",
    "During interviews with youth in the ILP it was apparent the youth\nmisunderstood what the agency is required to provide.\nClarification was provided to some of the youth during interviews.\nThe agency was advised to provide greater clarity about program\nservices versus youth responsibilities to incoming youth,\nspecifically youth that have babies.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend no change in the license status.\n_ _______________April 7, 2022______________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 10, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
