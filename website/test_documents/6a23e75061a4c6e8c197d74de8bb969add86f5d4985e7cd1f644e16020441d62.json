The youths are not cared for and appeared\ndehydrated. The youths alleged the agency has a food pantry, but\nit is always empty; they are often hungry, and they have to fend\nfor themselves.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAdministrator 2\nOn 10/4/2023, I spoke with the agency’s Quality Director\nAdministrator 2, whom Chief Administrator 1 had delegated to\nfollow up with me related to this special investigation.\nAdministrator 2 reported the agency had just received this\ncomplaint. She confirmed Youth A’s and Youth B’s placement in\nthe agency’s staffed independent living program; but she was not\nsure how long each youth had been with the program. She\nreported Quality Manager 3 would assist me related to my\ninvestigation of this complaint.\nComplainant X\nOn 10/5/2023 I interviewed Complainant X by telephone.\nComplainant X reported she is the case manager at the Salvation\nArmy located on W. Warren in Dearborn Heights, Michigan. Her\n2",
    "department facilitates the church and social services office for\nfolks needing services. She reported that on Tuesday, 10/3/2023,\naround 3:00PM, Youth A and Youth B went into their food pantry.\nA Salvation Army staff person saw them and brought them to\nComplainant X. Youth A and Youth B asked for food and water.\nBoth girls “looked badly”, in that they looked hot, exhausted, and\ndehydrated. One of the girl’s shirt was sticking to them. When\nComplainant X brought out water for them, both girls jumped for\nthe water. Complainant X acknowledged that 10/3/2023 was a\nvery hot day; and Youth A and Youth B reported they took the bus\npart of the way and had walked part of the way, to get to the\nSalvation Army.\nComplainant X said Youth A and Youth B told her they lived in an\nindependent living (IL) foster care program with other youths ages\n16 and older, and that they are not treated well, or fed. Youth A\nreported being at Vista’s IL program for a while. Youth B reported\nbeing new to the program, having been in other programs and this\none being the worst. Both girls reported Vista’s IL facility has a\nfood pantry, but it never has food in it. Complainant X asked\nYouth A and Youth B whether they had ever spoken with anyone\nabout not having food, about what they needed, and Youth B,\nstated no. Youth B reported that was because it would make their\nsituation worst if they told. Youth A agreed with Youth B by\ncommenting ‘Yeah, Yeah” Neither youth reported when they last\nate. They just reported being on their own, and never being fed.\nComplainant X reported when people come into their Salvation\nArmy program with a need, they have the person complete a brief\nintake, and application. They conducted such with Youth A and\nYouth B. Youth A and Youth B put down the names of four other\nyouths, who reportedly may need food/services. She said Youth A\nand Youth B left with a few can goods and nonperishable items\nthat they were able to fit into their backpacks. She said she had\noffered them a couple of boxes of food, but the girls did not have a\nway to carry that much. She reported Youth B had either called\nthe Vista IL facility or had gotten a call from someone there, and\nYouth B had asked for a ride home to carry the food; but they did\nnot get one. Complainant X overheard a staff (whom, Complainant\nX did not know) yell at Youth B and tell the youths they had to get\nhome by bus.\nComplainant X denied Youth A or Youth B ever coming to the\nSalvation Arny to ask for food prior to the date she stated. Nor\nwas she aware of any other youths from Vista Maria’s IL program\ncoming into the Salvation Army and asking for food.\n3",
    "Quality Manager 3\nOn October 6, I spoke with Quality Manager 3 onsite. She stated\nthe agency did not become aware of the incident until they\nreceived the complaint. She reported both Youth A and Youth B\nare in the agency’s IL Plus program located in their Shepherd Hall\nbuilding. She reported each youth in the program receives a\nstipend for expenses along with a bridge card to assist them with\nfood purchases. Case Manager 3 was not sure of the stipend\namounts received by either Youth A or Youth B. She said\nSupervisor 4, would know that information.\nYouth A\nOn 10/6/2023 I interviewed Youth A onsite at Shepard Hall. Youth\nA reported residing at the Vista Maria IL facility since about\nFebruary of 2023. She denied some aspects of this complaint.\nShe admitted to visiting the Salvation Army and asking for food,\nbut denied it being because there was no food available for her at\nVista Maria, while simultaneously indicating it was due to that.\nShe reported she did not have food and so she and Youth B had\nplanned to visit food pantries. She said she knew she could get\nfood at the Salvation Army by showing her identification and filling\nout an application. She did not disclose how she knew that.\nYouth A said she had mentioned to staff about two months ago\nthat she did not have food, and the staff person (whom she did not\nrecall), told her to use her bridge card. When I asked her whether\nshe told a staff person the day she went to the Salvation Army that\nshe did not have food that day, or whether she had asked them for\nfood, she had not. Youth A initially stated she asked Supervisor 4\nfor a $50 Walmart gift card to go get food and Supervisor 4 told\nher the agency did not have any more gift cards. Supervisor 4 told\nher to call the cafeteria for food. When I clarified with Youth A\nwhether she told Supervisor 4 that day that she did not have food,\nYouth A reported that was two months ago and she was advised\nto use her food stamps. Youth A reported the facility has a\ncafeteria, which she can get three meals a day, but the problem is\nthat sometimes the cafeteria is closed. She said the cafeteria is\nopen from noon to 5pm. When I asked her what she could do for\nfood if she got hungry before the cafeteria opened or after it\nclosed, Youth A reported there is a pantry in the building but there\nis no real food there. The pantry just has snacks, like, chips, apple\nsauce, fruit cups, cereal, Vienna sausages. Also, they can only go\nthere once per week because there is not enough for everyone.\nYouth A admitted all youths do have personal food, it is kept in\n4",
    "their personal refrigerator in their room, and in the basement’s\nrefrigerator with their name on it.\nIt is noteworthy that right after my interview with Youth A, which\nwas after 4:00pm, Youth A used her cell phone to call the\ncafeteria and place an order for dinner.\nYouth A reported being a full-time student. She said she receives\nan IL stipend check of $350 every two weeks; and she receives\n$108 in food stamps. She said the agency charges her $208 every\ntwo weeks for rent ($416). She said $700 is not enough to pay\nher bills, which also includes $127 monthly cell phone and private\nWi-Fi payment. She admitted the agency staff takes them\ngrocery shopping monthly or as needed. She reported knowing\nthis is an IL program but that it is hard trying to do everything on\nher own, especially since she does not have a job. She reported\nsince it’s an IL program they do not have to tell the staff exactly\nwhere they are going, but they do have to sign in and out of the\nbuilding. She said the day she and Youth B visited the Salvation\nArmy she did not sign out for the Salvation Army. The staff did\nnot know where she was going or why.\nOn 10/6/2023 Youth A left the building for the weekend before I\ncould view her room or personal refrigerator.\nSupervisor 4\nOn 10/6/2023 I interviewed Supervisor 4 onsite at Shepard Hall. I\nalso spoke with her briefly on 10/25/2023 onsite prior to me\ninterviewing Youth B. Supervisor 4 reported employment with the\nagency for two years. She supervises the IL workers and IL\ncoaches. She denied the allegation of there not being any food\nfor youths at the facility, or Youth A and Youth B having to fend for\nthemselves. She reported that Youth A has been in the agency’s\nIL program since March 2023 and Youth B since 8/16/2023. She\nreported that neither youth has been without access to food/a\nmeal or assistance. Nor had either of the girls reported they were\ngoing to pick up food because they had none or were hunger.\nNeither reported where they were going that day, because it’s not\nrequired that they report where they are going. They do have to\nsign out and be back before curfew. The day of the incident Youth\nA and Youth B signed out at 2:13pm and returned at 7:23PM.\nSupervisor 4 also affirmed aspects of Youth A’s reporting related\nto Youth A and other youths in the program receiving a stipend of\n$700 or a little more than that monthly. Additionally, of there being\na cafeteria onsite where youths can obtain, breakfast, lunch and\n5",
    "dinner meals, by calling their meal into that cafeteria, if the youth\nso chooses. Supervisor 4 said the youth just has to pick up a\ndinner meal before 5:00pm or have a staff pick it up for them. She\nsaid all youths’ rent, is only $208 monthly; and some youths\nincluding Youth A and Youth B often do not pay that. She\nreported that Youth A receives foods stamps, but Youth B\nprocrastinated with completion of her application for a bridge card.\nYouth B has only recently applied for assistance. She reported\nany other expenses for the youths is typically just a cell phone;\nand the rest of their money is for any other expenses they select.\nShe said despite staff’s attempts to budget with the youths, Youth\nA tends to waste her funds. She explained that about two weeks\nago, Youth A received/won $2700 via some type of MARE\n(Michigan Adoption Resource Exchange) drawing. Youth A was\nadvised to buy food to store and to put the bulk of the funds in the\nbank. Youth A did not. Youth A spent all the money. Youth A\npurchased clothing, inclusive of a full Lion’s jogging suit, gym\nshoes, an X box and other items. Supervisor B said Youth B\nspends her money in other not always responsible ways; inclusive\nof paying money for transports to go visit Youth B’s boyfriend. She\nsaid both Youth A and Youth B know her, her level of authority in\nthe IL program, and neither youth came to her that day to report a\nconcern. Also, neither of the youth reported they did not have\nfood. If they had reported this, arranging for food for them would\nnot have been a problem. Supervisor 4 reported, it was brought to\nher attention after the fact, by Youth C that Youth A had reported\nYouth A planned to set up Supervisor 4, so as to get the IL\nprogram shut down some way.\nSupervisor 4 further reported that every Friday an IL staff\ntransports the IL youths to grocery shop, if the youth wants to go.\nShe said Youth A has participated in grocery shopping a few\ntimes, but often Youth A, as well as many other youths sometime\nchoose to go to a restaurant or utilize door dash to order meals.\nSupervisor 4 said all the youths have a mini refrigerator and\nmicrowave in their room. Should a youth have a large supply of\nfood items, the youth can store items in either the upstairs’\nrefrigerator, or the one in the basement where there is also a full\nkitchen. Supervisor 4 added, the agency also sometimes uses gift\ncards to purchase a meal so that the girls do not have to use their\nfood stamps, and the staff can utilize that time to teach the youths\na skill. She said the agency also stocks food, which is “community\nfood” in the refrigerator or freezer where food is always located. If\na youth does not have food they can get food from there. Or the\nyouth can access “dry foods”, cracker, chips, noodles, nutritional\n6",
    "bars, etc. from the food pantry which always contains some type\nof items.\nYouth B\nOn 10/25/2023 I interviewed Youth B onsite at Shepard Hall. I\nread her the allegations and she reported the allegations as\nreported were not correct. She reported it was true she and Youth\nA visited the Salvation Army, but that she had never reported that\nshe was starving. She also denied telling anyone at the Salvation\nArmy that Vista Maria’s IL’s program was the worst place she had\never been in. She said she thought she was going to a thrift shop\nwith her friend. She admitted not receiving food stamps back\nthen, but reported it was not true that there was not food available\nfor her at Vista Maria. She reported the IL staff had offered to\nassist her in applying for a bridge card, but it was her who had not\nfollowed through, something she reported doing last week. She\nreported it is not the staff’s job to feed her, but they should know\nwhen a youth is in need. She said, the IL program has gift cards\nwhich it gives to youths for things they need; but the staff believes\nthe youth should have a plan for how it will be spent, and youths\ncan only get a gift card once every two weeks. She admitted she\ncan receive meals from the cafeteria, but said she chooses not to,\nbecause she does not like the food. She reported the food makes\nher sick due to her acid reflux disorder. As to the IL program\nhaving a pantry and refrigerators with food that she and other\nyouths can store food in, and access food items if they do not\nhave food, Youth B said those storages don’t always stay stocked;\nbut as long as food is there, she can use it. She further admitted\nto going grocery shopping with staff on Fridays, receiving an IL\nstipend from the state every two weeks, and being able to buy\nfood. She said, however, her finances have been “messed up”\nlately, meaning they have been low; but she did not say why her\nfinances have been low. Her stipend is $358 every two weeks,\nand she paid $208, monthly for rent, and $81 monthly for another\nexpense which she did not elaborate on.\nAfter my interview with Youth B, she showed me her room and\nrefrigerator, which contained a few food items.\nYouth Interviews\nOn 10/6/2023, I interviewed Youth C, Youth D onsite. I also\nattempted to interview Youth E, but Youth E refused to be\ninterviewed. Youth C and Youth D affirmed youths receiving a\nstipend from the government and a bridge card, which staff help\nthem to apply for when they first arrive. Additionally, them having\na microwave and mini fridge in their rooms, being able to receive\n7",
    "meal tickets for food from the cafeteria, having access to the food\npantry, and or them receiving gift cards if they run out of food.\nYouth C also reported that Youth A’s and Youth B’s trip to the\nSalvation Army was some type of plot. That Youth A and Youth B\nsaid they were going to go the different childcare places and\ncenters to try and get Vista Maria shut down. Youth C said Youth\nB was upset with staff over an incident of a knife being taking from\nher, and Youth B and Youth A wanted some staff to get in trouble.\nYouth C reported that unless Youth A and Youth B had eaten all\ntheir food, which they did not believe then Youth A and Youth B\nhad food. Youth C reported not hanging out with Youth A and\nYouth B, to be certain of the latter, and indicated Youth E might\nknow more specifics.\nYouth D also reported further information. She reported the IL\npantry may get low, but it is never empty. She said they shop to\nrestock the pantry every month; and the staff gets the IL youths\ninput on what the youths want to have in the pantry. Youth D said\nthey do have to ask to take things out the pantry, but that is so\nthat staff can write it down and know how to refill it. She said, they\ndo not have to ask for things out the community freezer and\nrefrigerator, they can just use what they need/want. She said the\nstaff refill the community freezer and refrigerator regularly and\ntakes youths shopping with their bridge card every other Friday.\nYouth D said youths can also go shopping on their own, because\n“It is an independent living program.”\nStaff Interviews\nOn 10/6/2023 I interviewed IL Staff 5, Staff 6, and Staff 7. Staff 6\nreported being off the day of this incident and having no\nknowledge of Youth A’s and Youth B’s Salvation Army visit. Staff\n5, and Staff 7 reported not knowing Youth A and Youth B visited\nthat center until after the fact. All the staff reported not knowing\nthat one could obtain food via the Salvation Army and were\nsurprise the youths had tried to do this.\nAll three of the staff confirmed information as reported by\nSupervisor 4, and others related to youths receiving stipends,\nbridge cards, and Youth A, Youth B and all the youths having\naccess to food. Staff 5 and Staff 6 denied that Youth A or Youth B\nreported to them that they were hungry or without food. Staff 7\nsaid Youth A is always saying she ran out of food, and she directs\nYouth A to the food pantry, community refrigerator and cafeteria.\nStaff 7 also confirmed Supervisor 4’s reporting of Youth A\n8",
    "receiving $2700 and wasting it on Lions’ gear and electronics\ninstead of essential items or saving it.\nTour Observation:\nDuring my onsite visits I viewed the upstairs and downstairs\nrefrigerators, as well as the freezer and the pantry which showed\nlimited food items in all on 10/6/2023, but more food items on\n10/25/2023, where meats, hotdogs, milk, bread, potatoes tots,\nchicken, frozen vegetables, egg rolls, were seen; and more\nnonperishable items were in the pantry such as pop tarts, noodles,\nwater, juice, apple sauce, peanut butter crackers, nutritional bars,\netc. on the latter date. The agency’s cafeteria was viewed to have\na full commercial kitchen where food is able to be prepared for\nchildren and youths in the Vista Maria campus programs, inclusive\nof its IL program. Also viewed was the current weeks menu that\nshowed a full meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth A’s and Youth B’s case records showed:\n➢ Youth A and Youth B signed an IL contract for entry\ninto the Vista Maria IL program.\n➢ Youth A is an MCI ward who entered Vista Maria’s IL\nprogram on 3/21/2023.\n➢ Youth A’s monthly stipend is documented as $714,\nfood stamps are $108 monthly. Youth A’s monthly\nexpenses are rent for $208 monthly. Her last budget\nwas completed 8/14/2023.\n➢ Youth A has AWOLed from the IL program a number\nof times since her initial placement.\n➢ Youth B is a temporary court ward, who entered the\nVista Maria IL program on 8/16/2023.\n➢ Youth B’s monthly stipend and rent is the same as\nYouth A’s.\nAnalysis Based on interviews, observations, and review of documents there\nis not evidence to support the allegations of the youths not having\naccess to food, food not being available to youths when needed,\nor a lack of financial support to meet the youth’s housing, clothing,\nfood, and other needs.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry.\nDescription (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nand able to meet the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\n9",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The staff are mean and rude to the youths. The youths called the\nshelter for a ride back to the facility and staff told them to get\nhome on their own.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAdministrator 2\nOn 10/4/2023, I spoke with the agency’s Quality Director\nAdministrator 2, related to this complaint. She confirmed Youth A’s\nand Youth B’s placement in the agency’s staffed independent\nliving program. She was not aware of any details related to this\ncomplaint; and reported Quality Manager 3 would follow up and\nassist me on this matter.\nComplainant X\nOn 10/5/2023 I interviewed Complainant X by telephone.\nComplainant X reported while Youth A and Youth B were at the\nSalvation Army the girls reported the IL facility’s staff do not treat\nthem well; that the staff are mean and rude to them. Complainant\nX acknowledged that neither youth defined what being mean or\nrude to them meant or entailed. Nor did the girls name the staff\nwho treated them that way. Complainant X reported she\nwitnessed such behavior by a staff person from the IL facility\nduring a telephone call Youth B had with a staff person.\nComplainant X said a person from the IL facility called Youth B,\nand Youth B put the call on speaker. Complainant X reported\nhearing the staff questioning Youth B about Youth B’s and Youth\nA’s whereabouts. As Youth B tried to explain that she and Youth\nA were getting food, the staff person began yelling at Youth B,\ntelling Youth B she has a meeting coming up that she would have\nto attend and she and Youth A needed to get home on their own\neither by walking or by bus.\nYouth A\nOn 10/6/2023 I interviewed Youth A onsite at Shepard Hall. Youth\nA reported to get along “okay” with the “upstairs staff” but not so\nwell with all the “downstairs staff”. She reported the latter is\nbecause “they yell at me, and just look at me crazy”. Youth A\nadmitted all the staff do not yell at her or look at her crazy. She\nreported Staff 8 looks at her crazy, and she overheard that staff\ntalking about her. The staff was telling someone in the office that\nYouth A does not belong there. Youth A said Staff 6 yells at her.\nYouth A’s example of when this yelling occurred, was related to\nYouth A burning a candle in her room. Youth A said Staff 6 yelled\nand cursed at her about the incident, took her candle; and would\nnot listen to the fact that the candle was her personal item and\n10",
    "part of her religion. Youth A denied speaking with Supervisor 4\nabout the staff persons’ behavior, but she may have spoken with\nher peer support worker, Staff 5, about the incident. With the\nexception of Youth B, Youth A denied any other youth witnessing\nStaff 6 yelling and cursing at her. Youth A reported no problems\nor concerns with any other staff.\nSupervisor 4\nOn 10/6/2023 I interviewed Supervisor 4 onsite at Shepard Hall.\nSupervisor 4 denied the allegations, but admitted she was the one\nto call Youth B about a meeting that Youth B was due at\npertaining to an upcoming court hearing. Supervisor 4 denied her\nvoice being raised or her yelling during the call. She said when\nYouth B said she was at the Salvation Army, she assumed Youth\nA was getting clothes. When Youth B asked her whether she\ncould come pick her and Youth A up, Supervisor 4 told Youth B,\nno, that the meeting was happening now; and Supervisor 4\nimmediately put Youth B on speaker, connecting them with the\ndepartment worker and others. Supervisor 4 reported after the\nmeeting Youth B did not ask her to come pick her up, nor did she\ntell Youth B to get home the best way she could. They just ended\nthe call by hanging up.\nAs for Youth A or Youth B reporting any staff mistreating them or\nyelling and cursing them; Youth B has not reported anything.\nYouth A recently reported that Staff 6 yelled and cursed her about\na candle. Supervisor 4 said she spoke with Staff 6 about the\nmatter and Staff 6 denied yelling or cursing Youth A. Staff 6\nexplained that while completed nightly security checks, Staff 6\nobserved Youth A burning a candle in her room; and Staff 6\nremoved the candle due to safety concerns. Supervisor 4\nreported following up with Youth A and advising Youth A to use a\nflameless candle to do her Tarot Cards, which Youth A reported is\na part of her religion.\nSupervisor 4 also reported last night Youth A texted her to say “I\nbetter get my staff” referring to Staff 6 and Staff 8, that those staff\npersons look at her crazy and that makes her feel uncomfortable.\nSupervisor 4 reported she will be following up with all about this\nmatter. Supervisor 4 denied any other youths reporting or\ncomplaining to her about Staff 6 and Staff 8 or that any staff was\nyelling and cursing them. She said the only thing the youths\ncomplain about is Staff 6 getting into their business; something\nSupervisor 4 explains happens by the mere fact that Staff 6 is an\nafternoon staff who has more interaction with the youths, tries to\n11",
    "engage them, and is asking them questions. Staff 8 is a midnight\nstaff, and the youths have limited personal interaction with her.\nYouth B\nOn 10/25/2023 I interviewed Youth B onsite at Shepard Hall.\nShe reported some staff need to work more to decrease issues\nthat come up with the youths, but she denied there being staff she\ndoes not get along with. She reported at times there are staff and\npeople she has issues with, but no staff persons are disrespecting\nher or mistreating her. As for a staff person yelling at her the day\nshe was at the Salvation Army, Youth B admitting she was to have\na court hearing, had forgotten about it and Supervisor 4 called and\nreminded her of that. Supervisor 4 was upset that she was not at\nthe facility and let that be known, but Supervisor 4 was not mean\nto her and they were told to get back to the facility on their own.\nYouth B said she and Youth B had gotten to the Salvation Army\non their own, so that was not a problem.\nYouth B acknowledged an awareness of Youth A having a burning\ncandle in her room, which is not allowed, but she did not report\nhearing any staff yelling at Youth A.\nYouth Interviews\nOn 10/6/2023, I interviewed Youth C, and Youth D onsite. I also\nattempted to interview Youth E, but Youth E refused to be\ninterviewed. Youth C and Youth D reported that staff treat them\nwell. Both youths denied being mistreated, yelled at or cursed.\nAside from Youth D reporting that some youths say Staff 6 will nag\nat them to do things, both Youth C and Youth D deny observing\nany staff be mean to or mistreat any of the youths.\nStaff Interviews\nOn 10/6/2023 I interviewed Staff 5, Staff 6, and Staff 7.\nStaff 5 is the IL specialist for both Youth A and Youth B. She\nreported on 10/3/2023 around 3:30pm she was on the call when\nSupervisor 4 called Youth B for a virtual meeting. Supervisor 4\nnever yelled at Youth A. As for Youth A and or Youth B coming\nto her to report or complain about any staff being mean, rude or\nyelling and cursing them, Staff 5 said Youth A texted her this\nmorning saying that “I need to check my staff”. Youth A indicated\nthat Staff 6 and Staff 8 were being rude and mean to her by\nlooking at her crazy. Staff 5 said she spoke with Youth A today\nabout Youth A’s concerns. Youth A said she ignores those staff\nwhen they talk to her because they make her feel uncomfortable,\nbecause she thinks they are talking about her. Staff 5 said she\n12",
    "also shared the information with Supervisor 4. Staff 5 further\nreported that Youth A is constantly trying different things to get out\nof the program, though she could not say for certain this complaint\nby Youth A is a part of that.\nAs to whether any other youths have complained or expressed\nconcerns about staff members mistreating them, Staff 5 reported\nthat other than some youths reporting, in general, that some staff\nare rude, without them giving any specific information about that\nor examples, she had not received any complaints about staff\nmistreatment.\nStaff 6 denied the allegation of her being mean and rude to\nyouths or her yelling or cursing Youth A or any youth. She\nadmitted her supervisor has spoken with her twice about a youth’s\ncomplaint of her being mean to them, but she denied it being true.\nShe said there was one incident with a youth who is no longer at\nfacility, and one related to Youth A. In the first incident. Staff 6\nreported she had asked the youth to do her chores and the youth\nyelled and cursed her and then reported the opposite. In that\nincident another staff was present and confirmed that. In the\nincident with Youth A, she had discovered Youth A to be burning a\ncandle in Youth A’s room and she had to retrieve the object and\nYouth B got upset about it and yelled at her.\nShe reported that as long as the youths are getting their way with\nstaff there are no problems, but if the youth is being told to follow\nrules or do something they do not like, the youth thinks staff are\nbeing mean. Staff 6 reported she does not curse or yell at any\nyouths. She admitted she has elevated her voice when the\noccasion calls for it; for instance, when youths are trying to fight,\nand she has to intervene. She said yelling and cursing is what\nsome youths do, when they are mad about being told something\nthey do not like.\nStaff 7 denied that she or any staff are mean or rude to the youths\nor have yelled or cursed at the youths. She said she is one of the\nstaff Youth A has mentioned in the past as being mean. That\nwhen Youth A can’t get her way, Youth A will say “staff don’t’ care\nabout her, that we are mean”. She said Youth A mostly complains\nthat Staff 6 is mean. Staff 7 reported that is because Staff 6 will\nnot let Youth A bend the rules, and Youth A has a problem with\nthat. Staff 7 said she was present during the candle incident. Staff\n6 advised Youth A she could not burn the candle and Staff 6 had\nto take the candle. Youth A yelled at Staff 6 and told Staff 6 to get\nout of her room. Staff 7 said, Staff 6 did not yell or curse Youth A.\n13",
    "Staff 6 advised Youth A, Staff 6 would speak with Supervisor 4\nabout the incident.\nStaff 7 was not aware of other youths complaining of staff\nmistreating them.\nAnalysis Based on interviews with staff and youths, there is insufficient\nevidence to support the allegations that staff are not of\nresponsible character and suitable and able to meet the needs of\nchildren and families served by the agency.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nIV.
