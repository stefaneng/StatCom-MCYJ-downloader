    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the\nfollowing information prior to employment or at the time\nspecified in this rule:\n(j) A written evaluation of the employee's performance\nwithin 30 days of the completion of the probationary period\nor within 180 days, whichever is less, and a written\nevaluation of the employee’s performance annually\nthereafter.\nOne of the existing employee files did not show documentation\nof the employee’s annual performance evaluation.\nR 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the\ndirect supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable\ninterval, eye-on checks of residents. The time between the\nvariable interval checks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nOne of the staff interviewed reported they complete 15 minute\nchecks but not in variable intervals, when the youth go to their\nbedrooms for the evening.\nRepeat violation: SI 2022C0446002, corresponding CAP\n11/23/2021, the facility must identify why the previous CAP\nwas not successful.\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training.\n(3) The licensee shall document that each direct care\nworker participated in a minimum of 50 clock hours of\nplanned training within the first year of employment and a\nminimum of 25 clock hours of training annually thereafter.\n4",
    "One of the six existing employee files reviewed did not\ndocument the required 25 hours of training required annually.\n2.) The facility is in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) The facility is in compliance will all additional MDDHS Contract/Policy\nrequirements.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not provided technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not provided consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has not had to submit any corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nDuring this period, the facility changed their Chief Administrator and closed the short\nterm program, which resulted in significant improvement and oversight. There was\nonly one complaint received that is currently being investigated. Although not\ncompleted, it does not appear that there will be any licensing violations in that open\ninvestigation. During this period there was only one restraint performed. In fact, there\nhas only been this one restraint in over seven months. The incident report was\nreviewed, and the facility documentation of the incident was appropriate. The facility\nis in the process of reviewing their restraint policy and will be providing updated policy\nif required before the due date. The facility hired a nurse in January 2022 and a\nsecond Nurse in March 2022 to ensure compliance with medication refills, dispensing,\nand training of staff. The nurse was interviewed and provided a detailed report of the\nmedication refill and dispensing process. There have been no concerns reported by\nstaff or youths regarding medication refills or dispensing during the reporting period.\nThis notes a marked improvement in this area.\nDuring this period monthly unannounced on-site inspections were completed, and\nyouths and staff were interviewed. The facility was well maintained and clean. The\nyouth bedrooms were clean and furnished, bathrooms were clean, medications refills\nand dispensing were reviewed, and meal menus were posted. Ample food was\nobserved in the cottages. I completed interviews with staff, who reported feeling\n5",
    "supported by management and believe the agency is meeting the youth’s needs. I\ninterviewed three youths. The youth interviewed reported feeling safe, receiving\nweekly individual and group therapy, participating in activities, receiving prescribed\nmedication, and all their needs are being met. There were no concerns noted by the\nyouth or staff.\nThe facility is currently fully staffed and are in ratio. They are also working with the\nResidential Collaboration and Technical Assistance Unit (RCTAU) and have been\nmeeting weekly with the Specialist.\nThe facility has improved in their implementation of CAPs. They completed all their\nCAPs from the prior period successfully, which is evident by the reduced number of\ncomplaints. Area of focus were staff sufficiency, supervision, maintaining ratio,\nfollowing facility policies/procedures, staff training, and medication refills and\ndispensing. The facility addressed these issues by hiring staff including two nurses,\nupdating medication policy, retraining of supervisors and staff, and weekly meetings\nare held by the clinical team and managers to discuss and address any concerns\nregarding each resident. CAP compliance has been verified through review of training\nlogs, meeting notes, interviews with supervisors, direct care staff, nurse, and youths.\nThe management team is very involved in the day-to-day operation which has had a\npositive impact on the facility performance, services, and improved their compliance.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility be issued a\nrenewal of their Regular license.\nJuly 26, 2022\n___________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 1, 2022\n___________________________________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n6"
