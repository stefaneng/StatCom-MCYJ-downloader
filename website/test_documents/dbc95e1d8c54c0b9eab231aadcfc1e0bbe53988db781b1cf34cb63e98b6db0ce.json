DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Technical Assistance was not requested or required.\n2",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Consultation was not requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period (7/18/24-7/17/25), and compliance with each individual CAP is as\nfollows: The first CAP was in response to the Special Investigation\n2025SIC0000356 which found a violation of CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention\nstandards and prohibitions. Staff were found to have engaged in holding a youth\nwithout being trained in restraint techniques. The CAP for this violation was\napproved on 3/14/25 and involves three action steps. The first step involves all\nstaff being trained in the Handle with Care restraint training method. This action\nstep has been reviewed twice since being approved and it was documented in\neach staff’s personal file that all staff were trained in the Handle with Care\ntechniques by the 6/11/25 unannounced visit. The second action step involved the\nfacility certified trainers using role-playing scenarios at every monthly mandatory\nstaff meeting. This was verified during unannounced quarterly meetings, and it\nwas found that staff meetings took place, and documentation indicates the role-\nplaying activity took place. The facility also provided the sign-in sheet to document\nthe staff in attendance, and it is noted all staff were involved. The third action step\ninvolves a debriefing meeting occurring after each physical management incident.\nDocumentation indicates that since the facility has trained all staff, there have\nbeen ten restraints and each had a documented debriefing session following the\nrestraint. The second CAP was in response to the Special Investigation\n2025SIC0000368 which found a violation of CCI Rule 400.4109 Program\nStatement. Staff were found to violate the program policy of leaving their personal\nitems locked in the staff office during working hours. Staff brought their personal\nitems out into the milieu allowing a youth to obtain medication from the staff’s\npurse. The CAP for this violation was approved on 4/24/25 and involves seven\naction steps. The first action step involves staff reviewing the personal belongings\nsection of the Code of Ethics at every monthly staff meeting. This has been\ndocumented as occurring during two unannounced quarterly inspection. The\nfacility has provided a copy of the agenda and sign-in sheet for each of the\nmeetings that occurred. The second action step involves administration redirecting\nand developing a coaching note each time staff violate this policy. Since the\napproval of the CAP and documented during two unannounced quarterly\n3",
    "inspection, there have been no documentation of any violations. The third action\nstep involves all youth safety plans being published to the connection teams app\nand reviewed during monthly staff meetings. Staff will sign when reviewing the\nconnection teams app and Administration will review for staff’s signatures. All of\nthe documented monthly staff meetings since the CAP was approved have had an\nagenda and signature sheet attached which documents staff’s involvement.\nAdministration provided documentation of staff signing the connection teams app.\nThe fourth action step involves staff not signing the connection teams app within\n72 hours. This will involve Administration meeting 1:1 with the staff to ensure they\nunderstand the safety plans and signing the connections team app. During the two\nunannounced quarterly inspection the facility has provided documentation of all\nstaff signing the connections team app after reviewing the safety plans. The fifth\naction step involves the staff who brought their personal items into the milieu is to\nreceive disciplinary action which is placed in their personal file. During the first\nunannounced quarterly inspection, it was found that this disciplinary action was in\nthe personal file and during the second unannounced quarterly inspection, it was\nfound that this staff was terminated, and the termination letter was found in the\npersonal file. This closes out this action step. The sixth action step involves the\nstaff involved being placed on a 30-day performance improvement plan with the\nChief Administrator completing weekly check-ins to review the staff’s performance.\nThis was documented as occurring until this staff was terminated from\nemployment at the facility thus ending this action step. The seventh action step\ninvolves the Chief Administrator conducting random reviews of camera footage\nduring the staff involved shifts. This was documented as occurring until this staff\nwas terminated from her employment. This ended this action step. The third\nrequired CAP was in response to the Special investigation 2025SIC0000512\nwhich involved a violation of CCI Rule 400.4142-1-e Health services; policies and\nprocedures with an approved CAP on 6/3/25. This violation involved a youth with\nmultiple mental health diagnoses not being given a dose of medication as\nrequired. The first action step involved the House Manager and/or Chief\nAdministrator reviewing the medication log weekly. They will document this effort\nthrough the use of a spreadsheet and during the first unannounced quarterly\ninspection it was found they are documenting their efforts to review the medication\nlog. The second action step involves the facility reviewing the medication policy\nduring the monthly staff meeting. This was reviewed during the first unannounced\nquarterly visit and documented to have taken place on 6/17/25. The third action\nstep involves the House Manager and/or Chief Administrator providing\nobservations of medication procedures once a week and recording these\nobservations on a weekly spreadsheet. During the first unannounced quarterly\ninspection during this CAP, it was documented the facility is conducting these\nobservations as outlined. The fourth action step involves disciplinary action for the\nstaff involved in the incident and a copy of the disciplinary action placed in the\nstaff’s personnel file. During the quarterly unannounced inspection, documentation\nwas found in the personnel file for the staff of the disciplinary action having taken\nplace. The fifth action step for this CAP involves the posting of the medication\npolicy in the connect team app and staff will sign acknowledgment of the policy in\n4",
    "connect team app. During the first quarterly unannounced inspection for this CAP,\nthis action step was found to have been completed as evidence of the observation\nof the connect team app and the signatures of staff being present.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator identified the three required corrective action plans and\noutlined the progress made with each one. The Chief Administrator also outlines a\nCAP for 2024SIC0001334 which occurred during the prior reporting period. She\nreports the impact of the action plans associated with the different CAPs has had a\npositive and fruitful impact on the ability to provide appropriate and helpful services\nto the youth in care. She also outlined the steps taken that were noted and\ndocumented during the quarterly licensing inspections (see CAP compliance\nabove). She documents the facility had two unplanned discharges during this\nreporting period with one youth being transferred to an alternative juvenile justice\nprogram due to a probation violation and the other youth transitioned from inpatient\nhospitalization to an adult foster care placement. She also documents that there\nappears to be an increase in the need for mental health services with the youth\nbeing referred and there is a struggle to find specialized treatment modalities due to\na shortage of qualified professionals causing extensive waiting lists. The Chief\nAdministrator notes the areas in need of improvement involve CCI Rule 400.4127\nStaff to Resident ratio, Public Act 116-722.120 Investigation, inspection, and\nexamination of conditions., CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement, CCI Rule\n400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures, and CCI Rule 400.4158\nIntervention standards and prohibitions. For each of these identified areas that\ncould improve, the Chief Administrator documents the action steps will be that the\nChief Administrator will consult with DCWL licensing consultant as needed. Each\nalso identified the Chief Administrator, Quality Supervisor, Chief Operating Officer,\nand Chief Regulatory Officer as responsible to ensure compliance. It appears the\nchoice of these areas corresponds with the special investigations that took place\nduring this reporting period.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed shared a report of a strong desire to work with the youth and\nprovide best practice in the youth’s care. The direct care staff interviewed are new\n5",
    "to the program and reported a very positive view of the program and administration.\nThey also reported receiving a significant amount of training with one staff\ncompleting 79 hours of training since being hired in February 2025. Administration\nstaff interviewed reported the new staff appear very capable when dealing with\nyouth but also understand there could be trials and Administration is very\nsupportive of helping new staff through training and oversite.\nThree of four youth in the program currently were interviewed with the fourth youth\nstaying in a local hospital under observations at this time. They reported feeling\nsafe at the facility and believed the program is beneficial to meet their needs. All\nreport receiving therapy sessions both individually and in a group setting. They\nreported a belief that the staff are invested in their wellbeing and are attentive to\ntheir needs. It should be noted that two of the youth are very new to the program.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThis is a multiple story older facility (originally a single home) located near\ndowntown Kalamazoo Michigan. This structure is in constant need of maintenance\nand the facility has a scheduled maintenance program to keep the building in good\nrepair. All required locked items (cleaning supplies, chemicals, and medications)\nwere found to be locked and items requiring to be posted were also found to be\nposted. There was an appropriate amount of frozen, fresh, and dry food available in\nthe kitchen area. All plumbing was in working order and fire extinguishers were up\nto date. The bedrooms were furnished appropriately as was the rest of the building.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n8/4/2025\n_____________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n08/08/2025\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n6",
