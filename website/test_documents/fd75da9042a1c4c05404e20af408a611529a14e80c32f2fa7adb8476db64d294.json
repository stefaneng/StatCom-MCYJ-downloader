(1) A Child Caring Institution, including private secure\njuvenile justice facilities, shall establish a process improvement\nand restraint reduction/elimination plan that:\n(5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth’s\ntreatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 4/27/2024, while in restraints, Staff 1 pushed his elbow into\nYouth A's neck and kept his elbow in Staff 1's neck for several\nseconds. Youth A could not breathe during this incident. Multiple\nstaff contest the allegations made by Youth A.\nInvestigation Staff 8 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n4/30/2024. She reported being notified about the restraint of Youth\nA late on 4/27/24 and went back to the facility on 4/28/24 to read\nthe reception rights report. She reported having nothing more to\nadd to the allegations except Youth A was assessed by nursing\nstaff on 4/28/24.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n4/30/2024 and again face-to-face at the facility on 5/1/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth A reported getting into\nan argument with Youth B which “almost escalated into a physical\nconfrontation”. Youth A reported going to his room and Staff 2 and\nStaff 3 called for “backup”. When Staff 1 showed up Youth A tried\nto shut the door to his room, but Staff 1 put his foot in the way\ncausing the door to stay open. Youth A reported telling Staff 1 to\ngo away, but Staff 1 refused to move. Youth A reported “slightly”\npushing Staff 1 and Staff 1 responding with “don’t do that”. Youth\nA reported pushing Staff 1 again and this time Staff 1 pushed\nYouth A to the floor at which time Youth A began to punch Staff 1\n2",
    "a few times. Staff 1 charged at Youth A and placed Youth A in a\nrestraint (Youth A was unclear and unsure of the chain of events\nat this point). Youth A reported Staff 1 grabbed Youth A’s arms\nand had Staff 1’s knees and legs so Youth A could not move.\nYouth A reported getting his right hand free and punching Staff 1\nagain in the face several times. Youth A reported he attacked Staff\n1 in an effort to get Staff 1 off of Youth A. Youth A reported not\nshowing any violence and denied hitting the mirror or wall, but just\n“cooling off” prior to Staff 1 showing up and blocking Youth A’s\ndoor. Youth A reported Staff 2 and Staff 4 helped Staff 1 with the\nrestraint but is unsure of other staff involved. Youth A reported\nwhen Staff 1 was holding Youth A on the ground, Staff 1 put his\nelbow on Youth A’s neck above the collar bone and on the left\nside of Youth A’s neck. Staff 1 had his elbow on Youth A’s neck\nfor 2-seconds and Youth A was making noises like Youth A was\nunable to breath. Youth A reported not getting any oxygen and\nshowed the position of Staff 1’s elbow as being on the left side of\nYouth A’s neck. Youth A changed the story of the incident and\nreported, not fighting the restraint because Staff 1 was pushing so\nhard that Youth A could not move. Youth A was unable to clarify\nwhy the story changed.\nAdministrator 1 and Administrator 2 were interviewed face-to-\nface at the facility on 5/1/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. Both reported being aware of the allegations and believe\nYouth A has been struggling emotionally since the permanency\nplan for Youth A has been changed. They reported Staff 1 does\nnot normally work on the pod Youth A is placed and only\nresponded when a call for support was made by Staff 2 and Staff\n3. They reported Youth A is receiving enhanced services which\ninvolves an increase in individual therapy sessions, more team\nmeetings to process ways to support Youth A, medication for\nemotional regulation, increased well-being checks, and one-on-\none supervision if necessary. They reported information is passed\nbetween shifts in regard to Youth A’s behavior along with shift\nnotes to ensure oncoming staff are aware of any possible issues.\nThey reported Youth A presented with three specific different\nstories to the State Recipient Rights individual. Neither,\nAdministrator 1 nor Administrator 2 had any firsthand information\nabout the incident.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 5/1/2024\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported being present\nduring the incident. He reported Youth A got into a disagreement\nwith Youth B resulting in Youth A becoming escalated and going\nin and out of Youth A’s room for a quarter of an hour. Finally,\n3",
    "Youth A went into Youth A’s room and Staff 2 heard what sounded\nlike Youth A throwing things and kicking the door. After trying to\ndeescalate Youth A and being unsuccessful, Staff 2 called for\nsupport. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 went to Youth A’s doorway and\nStaff 1 and Youth A spent some time talking. Youth A then\n“lunged” at Staff 1 causing Staff 1 to block then hold Youth A’s\narms and redirect Youth A, “bringing Youth A to the floor”. Staff 2\nmoved to help with the restraint and was told to hold Youth A’s\nlegs. Staff 2 reported Youth A was trying to kick Staff 2, so Staff 2\nadjusted his hold on Youth A’s legs. Staff 2 denied observing\nYouth A punch Staff 1 and never observed Staff 1’s arms or hands\nnear Youth A’s neck. Staff 2 reaffirmed this because he was\n“monitoring and watching everything”. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nwas thrashing around and yelling at Staff 1. Staff 2 reported Staff\n1 was “very professional and good” with the restraint and\ninteractions with Youth A. Youth A never complained of any\ninjuries or being unable to breath during the incident or after the\nrestraint. Staff 2 reported Youth A was repositioned during the\nrestraint because Youth A was too close to the bed and other staff\nwere unable to reach in order to support the restraint. Staff 2 was\nunsure who the other staff were who came to support them. A\nnursing staff (unidentified) was present and after releasing Youth\nA, this nursing staff asked how Youth A was doing.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/1/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth B\nreported being present during the restraint of Youth A. Youth B\nreported observing “choking and stuff” with Youth A during the\nrestraint. Youth B gave an example of the choking and placed\nboth of Youth B’s hand around Youth B’s throat in a choking\nmanner. Youth B reported he walked to the doorway of Youth A’s\nbedroom where the restraint was taking place so Youth B could\nwatch and make sure staff “did not lie” about the restraint. Youth B\nreported Youth A was trying to get Staff 1 off of Youth A and\nYouth A told Staff 1 that Youth A would get Staff 1 when Youth A\nis released from the program.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/1/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nYouth A has been doing well in the program over the past few\nweeks but with the upcoming termination of his parent’s parental\nrights, Youth A is grieving this loss. She reported speaking to\nYouth A about the restraint in this allegation and having Youth A\nchange the story several times. Youth A reported hitting and\npunching the walls in Youth A’s room but later told Therapist\nYouth A did not hit or punch any walls. Youth A first told Therapist\n4",
    "Youth A took a swing at Staff 1 but later the story changed to\nYouth A being charged by Staff 1. Youth A informed Therapist that\nYouth A didn’t resist Staff 1 before or during the restraint but then\nreported to Therapist Youth A punched Staff 1 four times. Youth A\ninformed Therapist that Youth A was scared and unable to breath\nfor 15-seconds when being choked by Staff 1. Therapist reported\nYouth A’s story about the restraint changed and Youth A told\nTherapist, Staff 1 pushed Youth A to the ground while kicking\nYouth A and choking Youth A. Therapist reported being confused\nhow Youth A could have all three of these things happened at the\nsame time. Therapist reported being concerned about Youth A’s\nhistory of lying to authorities with no sign of remorse.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 5/1/2024\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 1 reported working\non a different unit the day of the incident with Youth A when he\nreceived a call for support from the unit containing Youth A. When\nhe walked onto the unit, Staff 1 noticed Youth B, Staff 2, and Staff\n3 all standing near Youth A’s bedroom door. Staff 1 reported\ntaking Staff 3 aside and asking what was occurring. Staff 3\ninformed Staff 1, Youth A was in Youth A’s room punching a\nmirror and Youth A’ hands were bleeding. Staff 1 reported walking\nto Youth A’s bedroom door, opening the door, and calling for\nYouth A. Youth A started heading towards the door and was\ncursing and yelling before trying to push Staff 1 out of the\ndoorway. Staff 1 reported he told Youth A, that Staff 1 can’t leave\nYouth A alone and Staff 1 needed Youth A to step out of the\nbedroom. Staff 1 reported Youth A kept pushing Staff 1 and Staff\n1 kept informing Youth A that Staff 1 could not leave Youth A\nalone in the room because of Youth A’s behaviors. Staff 1 blocked\nthe door and would not let Youth A shut the door. When Youth A\nwas able to shut the door, Staff 1 would open the door again. Staff\n1 reported the second time he was able to open the door, Youth A\npushed Staff 1 and ‘tried to hit” Staff 1. Staff 2 and Staff 3 were\nstanding behind Staff 1 and Staff 1 reported feeling comfortable\nenough (with Staff 2 and Staff 3’s support) to start a restraint. Staff\n1 reported Staff 2, Staff 3, and Youth B were all standing in the\nroom when the restraint began. Youth B kept walking in and out of\nthe bedroom. Youth A was able to punch Staff 1 a couple of times\nbefore Staff 1 got behind Youth A and started a standing hold.\nStaff 1 was unclear how both Staff 1 and Youth A ended up on the\nground but once on the ground Staff 1 had a hold of Youth A’s\nwrists while holding them above Youth A’s head. Staff 1 reported\nkneeling on the left side of Youth A so his weight was not on\nYouth A who was laying on Youth A’s back. Staff 2 assisted by\nholding Youth A’s legs while Staff 3 called for “show” (assistance\n5",
    "with a restraint). Staff 1 reported other staff (unknown to Staff 1)\ncame to assist and he switched out with an unidentified staff\n(Nursing tech 1). Prior to Staff 1 leaving the pod, the other staff let\nYouth A out of the restraint and Youth A tried to push Staff 1 (who\nwas leaving) and Staff 1 left through the classroom door to avoid\nfurther interaction with Youth A. Staff 1 reported needing to get off\nthe pod so his presence was not triggering Youth A. Staff 1 denied\nhis elbows or hands were near Youth A’s neck at any time during\nthe restraint.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 5/1/2024 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS worker. Staff 3 reported being present during the\nincident. She remembered the argument between Youth A and\nYouth B before Youth A asked to go to Youth A’s room to sleep.\nAfter telling Youth A it was alright to go to the room, Staff 3 heard\nloud banging noises coming from Youth A’s room. Staff 3 checked\non Youth A who told Staff 3 to “get the fuck out” of Youth A’s\nroom. Staff 3 noticed Youth A's knuckles bleeding and Staff 3 told\nStaff 2 to call for support. Staff 3 didn’t believe herself and Staff 2\nwould have been successful in trying to restrain Youth A, if\nneeded. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 came onto the pod and went to\nYouth A’s doorway. Youth A and Staff 1 went back and forth for\nabout half a minute about how Staff 1 couldn’t leave Youth A\nalone in the room because of safety concerns. Youth A finally took\na swing at Staff 1 who initiated a one person standing restraint.\nStaff 3 was unsure if Youth A and Staff 1 fell to the ground or if\nStaff 1 took Youth A to the ground because Youth A kept fighting.\nStaff 3 reported Staff 2 took hold of Youth A’s legs once on the\nground, Staff 3 believed Staff 1 was on the side of Youth A and\nholding Youth A’s wrists.

Staff 3 denied ever hearing\nYouth A say Youth A could not breath and following the restraint,\nStaff 3 had interactions with Youth A who never said anything\nabout not being able to breath. Staff 3 reported Youth B never\ncame into the bedroom during the restraint but may have looked\ninto the room. Staff 3 reported 6 to 8 other staff (unknown to Staff\n3) showed up for the “show” and she believes there were 1 or 2\nnursing staff (unknown to Staff 3) present for the “show”. She was\nunable to identify who the specific staff were that responded to the\n“show”. Staff 3 had no concerns about the techniques used by\nStaff 1 and believed they were appropriate and taught by the\nfacility.\nNursing Tech 1 was interviewed via phone on 5/1/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported responding to\nthe “show” and arriving at the end of the restraint. She reported\n6",
    "swapping out with Staff 1 and reported there were two staff\n(unidentified) holding Youth A’s arms and one staff (unidentified)\nholding Youth A's legs.
