EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during\nthis period under review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator (CA) reported to improve the outcome for their youth in\ncare. Their agency is partnering with a private agency to pilot the kinship\nconnections program. He stated this program has a focus on kinship care and\n3",
    "supportive services for kinship caregivers. Implementation of this program has\nsignificantly impacted both operational and programmatic aspects of the child\nwelfare system for those children who must be placed in foster care.\nThe CA reported staff turnover in 2023 continued to be an ongoing challenge for\ncompliance. He said in order to maintain caseload compliance and continuity of\nservice delivery, it is critical to have new hires available to fill vacancies. He\nreported that in situations where staff departure is unexpected, it takes an\nextended amount of time to have a new staff hired and trained for the vacant\nposition. He reported another struggle their agency faced is insufficient foster and\nrelative homes to meet the increasing needs of the children entering foster care\nalong with a lack of family support and agency resources to provide to caregivers.\nThe CA reported that on a positive note, all staff have received ongoing direction\nand training on licensing rules, policy and ISEP commitments on an ongoing\nbasis. He said Oakland County conducts monthly meetings with foster care\nsupervisors and staff regarding Key Performance Indicators and any applicable\npolicy issues. He said supervisors also participate in weekly Book of Business\nmeetings with staff.\nFinancial Overview\nA financial audit was not required, this licensee is an MDHHS office.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff on site. Staff reported feeling supported\nby the agency and supervisors are always available. Staff reported their\ncoworkers assist them if needed and that they all communicate with one another\non a consistent basis. Staff reported the only concern they have would be if the\nagency would hire more workers with flexible hours to assist with parenting time.\nStaff reported this is one of their greatest needs.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has sufficient office space and equipment to perform the job functions.\nThe case files & CHRI records are stored in locked cabinets to prevent\nunauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe agency had one safety alert:\nConcern:\nThe caregivers have a spa/hot tub with a cover that cannot be locked when the tub\nis not in use. The basement does not have a smoke detector.\nResolution:\nThe licensing worker went to the home on 12/12/2023 and verified that the\ncaregivers installed locks on the hot tub that is operable. The caregivers also have a\nflotation rescue ring that was observed by the licensing worker. The smoke detector\n4",
    "was installed in the basement, tested and in working order. Photos verification of all\nitems was provided.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n01/02/2024\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 3, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
