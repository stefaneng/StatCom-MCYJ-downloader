Staff 1 allegedly made Youth J touch staff 1's breasts while facetiming him.\nStaff 1 also showed Youth J a photo of her boyfriend's penis.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThese allegations were reported to Van Buren Township law enforcement. Shortly\nafter allegations were received, Youth J was psychiatrically hospitalized for weeks.\nShe was replaced in a foster home and AWOLed from the foster home around\n9/21/21. As of 10/14/21, her whereabouts were still unknown.\nInterviews\nI interviewed Staff 1, age 22, jointly with Government Worker 1 on 8/17/21. She has\nworked at the facility for two months. On 8/15/21, Staff 1 worked a double shift and\nsupervised four youth alone from 7am – 11pm. She said Youth J was “on watch”\ndue to self-harm. Being “on watch” means the youth must stay near staff during\nwaking hours and leave her bedroom door open while sleeping.\nStaff 1 was asked if she used her personal cell phone at work on 8/15/21. She said\nshe was outdoors with Youth J when she answered a facetime call from her sister.\nStaff 1 denied having a “boyfriend” or facetiming with anyone else that day. She\nvoluntarily showed us her call history. Her phone showed one 5-minute call to a\ncontact with a female name who Staff 1 identified as her sister.\nGovernment Worker 1 read the current allegations aloud to Staff 1. Regarding\nfacetiming her boyfriend, Staff 1 denied talking to any male on 8/15/21. She\nclarified, “I do have a best friend (a male pseudonym in her contacts). Youth J has\n3",
    "asked to call him twice…Youth J asked his real name and I said (his first\nname)…She has never communicated with him, ever.”\nStaff 1 was asked if she had any explicit photos on her phone. She was unsure.\nShe was asked if she showed Youth J a photo of any male’s penis, to which she\nanswered “No.”\nStaff 1 was asked if she touched Youth J’s breasts or had Youth J touch her breasts\ninside or outside of the clothes. Staff 1 appeared shocked and denied touching\nYouth J’s breast. She said it was possible she accidently “brushed against” the\nyouth when she “may’ve gone into Youth J’s room to unlock her closet.”\nI interviewed Youth G, age 17, jointly with Government Worker 1. On 8/15/21, she\nsaid she was away from the facility working until 8pm. When she returned, Youth J\ntold Youth G that Staff 1 “was being really weird.” Youth J told her that Staff 1\nunlocked her closet and made Youth J touch her “boob.” At one point, Youth G saw\nStaff 1 and Youth J outside in the parking lot. “I heard a man on the (Staff 1’s)\nphone. They were out there 10 – 15 minutes plus in the front office for a while too.\nYouth J came and told me Staff 1’s boyfriend showed her “his thing” (penis).”\nI interviewed Youth C, age 17, jointly with Government Worker 1. After 8pm, she\nsaid Staff 1 was with Youth J in the front office, then they went outside. “We (Youths\nC and G) could hear someone on the phone…Youth J told me later that she was\nscared. That Staff 1 showed her pictures and videos of her boyfriend and made her\ntouch her. Staff 1 unlocked Youth J’s closet and was touching her and making her\nlift her shirt. Staff 1 had taken pictures of Youth J on her phone. Staff 1 took other\npictures of Youth J a few days before.”\nYouth J was hospitalized just after this allegation was received. She was moved to\na foster home and AWOLed around 9/21/2021. As of 10/14/21, Youth J remains on\nAWOL status. Therefore, a forensic interview could not be scheduled. If Youth A\nbecomes available for interview in the future, an addendum to this report will be\ncompleted.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n4",
    "(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position\nassigned.\nANALYSIS: Youth J is on AWOL status and unavailable for interview.\nUntil they are both forensically interviewed by law enforcement,\nit cannot be determined if former Staff 1 will be criminally\ncharged and/or deemed unsuitable to work with children in the\nfuture. However, at this time there is insufficient evidence of a\nrule violation as Staff 1 denied the allegations and her phone did\nnot support a call to a male during the time identified. If Youth A\nbecomes available for interview in the future, an addendum to\nthis report will be completed.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDING:\nDuring this investigation, Staff 1 said she and Youth J went outdoors on 8/15/21 to\ntake photos while three youths remained in the building. Chief Administrator 1 (CA\n1) confirmed that higher level youth are allowed to be in the building together\nunsupervised.\nStaff 1 said Youth J asked her to go outdoors to take photos of her hoping Staff 1\nwould have the photos printed and give them to Youth J for her own use. Staff 1\nwillingly allowed us to view the photos she had taken of Youth J. There were 45\nphotos – most showed Youth J posing (all fully clothed), and some were selfies of\nStaff 1 and Youth J posing together. Timestamps on the photos showed they were\ntaken from 1:47pm – 2:20pm.\nI reviewed Girlstown’s policy #250 Standards of Conduct which indicates staff shall\nnot take pictures of clients for the staff’s personal use.\nAfter interviewing Staff 1, Government Worker and I met with CA 1 and Program\nManager 1. Their plan was to notify Staff 1 that she was being placed on\nadministrative leave pending the outcome of this investigation. I asked them to\nmake sure all of the photos that were taken of Youth J were deleted from Staff 1’s\nphone prior to placing the staff on leave.\nCA 1 and Program Manager 1 met with Staff 1 and assured that all photos of Youth\nJ were deleted. Once Staff 1 learned that she was being placed on leave, CA 1 said\nshe immediately resigned.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 had 45 photos of Youth J on her phone. Agency policy\nindicates staff shall not take photos of youth.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nOctober 14, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 14, 2021\n_______________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
