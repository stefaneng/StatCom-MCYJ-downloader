TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Transferred staff within the overarching Bethany Christian Services organization\nwho were not previously hired under the specific facility's license must meet the\nrequirements of new staff and need to follow the rules as outlined for new hires.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• The facility did not request or require any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nOne related to the 2023 Renewal audit and one related to SIR #2024SIC0001515.\nThe violations for the 2023 Renewal audit were handled accordingly:\n• Rules 113(1)(f)(ii) and 113(1)(i): The facility created a \"new hire process\"\nform and policy to ensure a review of the candidate's file was being\ncompleted prior to hire. This process was successful as there were no\nviolations for these rules in the current audit.\n3",
    "• Rule 127(4): The facility switched over to an online reporting system for\ndocumenting observation checks as well as having the supervisor\ncomplete random video reviews to ensure observation checks were being\ncompleted as required. This process was successful as there were no\nviolations for these rules in the current audit.\n• Rules 155(1), 156(5), and 167(4): The facility trained case managers on\nthe policy, hired a new case management supervisor, and had regular\ndue date reminders completed provided to the case managers via email.\nIn addition, the Assistant Program Director has been overseeing the case\nmanagement side, which has helped with follow-up and compliance.\nThese processes were successful as there were no violations for these\nrules in the current audit.\nThe rule violation for SIR #2024SIC0001515 dated 7/30/24 was regarding Rule\n118. The facility addressed the concern by completing a variance after the\nviolation was found. The variance was approved on 7/9/24. In addition, the job\ndescription was updated to reflect the correct position requirements, and\nchecklists were created for new hires/transfers to ensure staff meet the\nrequirements of their positions prior to hire. Chief Administrator is also holding\nquarterly CAP compliance meetings to monitor.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's annual budget and financial audit were reviewed with no concerns\nnoted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported the violations from the 2023 Renewal audit were\ndiscussed and trained with program leadership as well as new hires. The facility\nhas implemented new processes where the program shares State licensing\nfindings with applicable team members and reviews them during quarterly case\ncompliance meetings with the CA. CA notes this has helped with ensuring they are\nall aware of the required action steps and are proactive in avoiding repeat\nviolations. CA noted updating new hire and transferred staff checklists were very\nbeneficial to ensure personnel record requirements were met. CA reported she\ncontinues to have bi-weekly group supervision with program leadership to review\nCCI compliance, which has improved oversight and communication.\n4",
    "Staff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported they enjoy working at the facility. They feel the new home supervisor\nhas been an excellent addition, is very supportive, has open communication, and is\ndoing a great job. New staff reported orientation and shadow shifts were very\nhelpful in learning their roles. The Assistant Program Director reported they've\nreally been working on improving the case management process regarding\ndischarge reports, report timeliness, signatures, and case files.\nYouth reported no concerns. They feel safe at the facility, feel they have staff they\ncan speak to if they have a need/concern, get enough food, and feel staff treat\nthem well.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on 9/6/24 and there were no concerns noted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nSeptember 16, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 17, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
