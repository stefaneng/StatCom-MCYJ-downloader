EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were 2 incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. The two special evaluations resulting in corporal punishment violations\nreviewed were completed thoroughly and contained appropriate recommendations\nbased on the findings. No concerns were noted other than the one report\ndocumenting the verbal summary was provided prior to the completion of the\ninvestigation. An interview was conducted with the worker who completed that special\nevaluation, and that worker reported the verbal summary documented was just a\npreliminary discussion with the foster family about the likely findings. A final verbal",
    "summary was provided at the conclusion of the investigation; however, that was not\naccurately documented in CWLM.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The one\nCAP submitted by the agency during the period under review was submitted in\nresponse to the 2/16/2024 interim licensing inspection report and was approved\non 3/7/2024. That CAP addressed eight violations, three of which were policy\nviolations no longer regulated by DCWL. The remaining five violations were rule\nrelated. Compliance was achieved and maintained for four of those rules while the\nremaining rule (initial medical examination timeliness) was repeated during the\ncurrent period under review. Eight rule violations were established this year that\nwere not established during the 2024 or 2023 licensing inspections.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator report completed during the period under review indicated\nbarriers to compliance such as employee performance issues, worker turnover\nresulting in half of the foster care team having less than one year experience, a\nhiring pause resulting in low staffing, as well as staff medical leaves for periods\ntwo months at minimum. The chief administrator indicated the prior year's CAP\nwas effective, overall, and resulted in improved compliance with initial/replacement\ndocumentation, performance evaluations, and Family Team Meeting\ndocumentation. Improvements in these areas were noted during this year's\ninspection.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed reported receiving supportive supervision\nthroughout the year during which some workers left the agency and some were on\nmedical or parental leave. They reported receiving assistance from co-worker,\nsupervisors, the program manager, and the director with tasks and answers, as\nneeded. No concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe office appeared to have adequate space and equipment to provide for the\ndelivery of foster home certification, foster care, and independent living services.\nFiles are stored in a secured file room with locked cabinets containing closed\nadoption files.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns identified.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nMarch 7, 2025\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 10, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
