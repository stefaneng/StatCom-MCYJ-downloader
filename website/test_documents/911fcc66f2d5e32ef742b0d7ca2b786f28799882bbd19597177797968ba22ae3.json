    "Rule Code Foster home record.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12328\nSection (2) The record must contain all the following information:\nDescription\n(e) Any written response from a foster parent, as provided by R\n400.12327(6)(b).\nViolation Potential Rule Violation.\nType\nAllegation Foster parent is attempting to transfer their license to another\nagency but has been rejected. The agencies that the foster parent\nis attempting to transfer the license to are unable to see the foster\nparent's written responses in the licensing file. Therefore, the\nagencies evaluating the transfer are unable to see that the foster\nparent disputes the findings in the previous special evaluations.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nFoster Parent: On 8/9/2024 I emailed Foster Parent as no\ntelephone number was indicated in the complaint. On 8/12/2024 I\ninterviewed Foster Parent about the complaint. She reported\nbeing licensed with the agency since 2019 and having fostered\nthree siblings whom she had attempted to adopt and who were\nremoved from her care following a special evaluation alleging\ninappropriate discipline, which she disputed. She affirmed\ninformation as stated in the complaint and information reported by\nDivision of Child Welfare Licensing Supervisor (DCWLS) related\nto the agency’s revocation recommendation, and the number of\npast special evaluations. She said when the agency was\nconducting special evaluations on her home she was submitting\nstatements. She said she found out the agency was not putting\nher information in her file, such as a report from her therapist,\nwhen the agency recommended a psychological and a statement\nfrom her mother’s doctor related to a past investigation.\nAdditionally, there was an adoption reference she believes was\nnot placed in her file. She believes her efforts to transfer her\nlicense to another agency has been hampered, because the\nagency did not provide the agencies she sought to transfer to the\ninformation she gave the agency in reply to the special\nevaluations the agency completed on her. She believes she had\nwritten a response to each special evaluation the agency\nconducted on her. She did not advise how she had submitted\nthose written responses, nor the timeframe of them. I advised\nFoster Parent the agency denied receiving responses from her\n2",
    "and that the department’s electronic file for her does not show any\nresponse either. I informed her I had obtained a copy of the\ndocuments she provided DCWLS, but those documents were not\nresponses to special evaluations. I asked whether she had copies\nof the documents she had provided the agency, and or email\nevidence showing when, and to whom, she provided those items\non 8/29/2024 via email.\nChief Administrator (CA): On 8/12/2024 CA responded to my\nemail contact to her about this complaint via email. CA indicated\nSupervisor is the licensing supervisor who delt with Foster Parent\non all special investigations. CA indicated Foster Parent never\nprovided a written response to the agency on any special\nevaluations.\nDivision of Child Welfare Supervisor (DCWLS): On 8/13/2024 I\ninterviewed DCWLS by TEAMS related to the complaint. DCWLS\nreported it appeared that the agency had completed a number of\nspecial investigations related to Foster Parent’s foster home that\nwere for the same allegations. She indicated the agency had\nrecommended revocation of Foster Parent’s foster home license\nand that recommendation was not upheld by the department. She\nsaid its alleged the agency never advised there was a\npsychological report on Foster Parent. Nor that they had any\nwritten responses from Foster Parent related to her special\nevaluations. DCWLS said Foster Parent reported she completed\na psychological evaluation and provided that to the agency as well\nas other written responses. Foster Parent reported after the\nagency was not successful with the revocation of her foster home\nlicense, she attempted to transfer her license and has not been\nable to do so. Foster Parent expressed concern that her inability\nto transfer her license is due to Catholic Charities not providing\nher written responses to the special evaluations or all her\ninformation to the other agencies she applied to transfer to.\nDCWLS reported Foster Parent also expressed concern the\nagency only shared the many special evaluations, which show her\nnegatively. The agency did not provide information like the\npsychological evaluation she obtained. DCWLS provided me\ndocuments Foster Parent had sent her copies of for my review.\nSupervisor: On 8/19/2024 I interviewed Supervisor by telephone.\nSupervisor reported being with the agency for 11 years. She\nreported it was true that Foster Parent underwent a number of\nspecial evaluations. Perhaps 13 over the course of Foster\nParent’s licensure with the agency. She reported it was corrected\nthat some of the evaluations were for the same allegations or\nallegation type. All being around inappropriate discipline, and four\n3",
    "of the special evaluations led to the agency making a\nrecommendation to the department for revocation of Foster\nParent’s foster home license. She reported she completed a few\nof Foster Parent’s past special evaluations and with others, she\nwas the supervisor. She said they always advised Foster Parent\nthat they could write a written response to the special evaluations\nbut Foster Parent never submitted a written respond to any of the\nspecial evaluations.\nSupervisor said the agency also completed an adoption home\nassessment on Foster Parent, where the agency denied Foster\nParent’s application to adopt, and Foster Parent did not submit a\nresponse related to that denial either. She said any written\nresponse Foster Parent would have provided would have been\nincluded/ uploaded into Foster Parent’s file. She reported the file\nis electronic and there is nothing in a hard file. She said Foster\nParent did produce a letter from a psychologist who did not\ncomplete a psychological evaluation on Foster Parent. She\nreported that document was done because the agency’s adoption\ndepartment requested a psychological from Foster Parent related\nto the adoption application. Supervisor reiterated that if there was\nany document submitted by Foster Parent related to any special\nevaluation, they would have included it in the special evaluation\nfile, which any licensed agency Foster Parent would have been\nseeking to transfer to would have access to for review.\nSupervisor reported Foster Parent has tried to transfer to four\nseparate agencies, and no one has accepted her. She said,\nFoster Parent remains licensed through Catholic Charities.\nLicensing Worker (LW): On 8/28/2024 I interviewed LW by\ntelephone. She affirmed information as reported by CA and\nSupervisor. She reported completing about seven of Foster\nParent’s special evaluations dating back to 2021. She said Foster\nParent was always advised by letter of her rights to submit a\nwritten response to the special evaluation. Foster Parent always\nsaid she was going to write a response but never did so; not even\nthe last special evaluation where the agency had recommended\nrevocation. LW reported Foster Parent was aware of how to\nsubmit documentations to her/the agency. She the agency\nrequested a psychological evaluation related to Foster Parents\nadoption pursuit, not for licensing. Two documents were\ncompleted; the one Foster Parent obtained on her own, which was\nnot sufficient, and one the agency recommended. Both are a part\nof Foster Parent’s file.\n4",
    "LW advised given the departments electronic files the agency\ndoes not send out foster parent documents when a foster parent is\nseeking to transfer their license. They give courtesy access to the\nagency that reaches out to them, so that agency can\naccess/review the foster parent’s CWLM file. LW said four\nagencies, Agency 1, Agency 2, Agency 3, and Agency 4 reached\nout and courtesy access was allowed each agency so that they\ncould review all documents/information in Foster Parent’s file and\nmake a decision about whether they would accept a transfer of\nFoster Parent’s license.\nAgency 3’s Licensing Supervisor(A3LS): On 8/29/2024 I spoke\nwith A3LS by telephone. She reported Catholic Charities gave her\naccess to Foster Parent’s licensing file, which she reviewed.\nFoster Parent also sent them documents that were character\nreferences. She said it had been a while since she reviewed the\nfile, but she recalls seeing a psychological report for Foster\nParent. She did not recall seeing any responses on file from\nFoster Parent. Nor did she recall whether Foster Parent reported\nproviding any at that time.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nDocuments provided to me from DCWLS for Foster Parent which\nshowed:\n• A lengthy letter from Foster Parent to the Michigan Children\nInstitute Superintendent explaining and or disputing what\nshe saw as flaws or incorrect information in /with her family\nadoption assessment.\n• A support letter from a past attorney who reported to have\nserved as GAL (Guadian Ad Litem) for three children who\nhad been in Foster Parent’s.\n• A letter, not a psychological evaluation, from a licensed\nprofessional counselor dated 4/16/2022. The letter\nindicated the counselor met with Foster Parent for a\npsychological on 4/13/2022. This document went on to\nindicate the counselor’s professional opinion, of Foster\nParent based on his interview with her. He noted no\nsignificant psychological or mental issues that would\nnegatively affect her mental, emotional, and physical ability\nto be an adoptive parent.\n• No letter or notes related to a response to any special\nevaluations were included in the documents from DCWLS,\nas provided by Foster Parent.\nFoster Parent’s CWLM and MISACWIS file which showed:\n5",
    "• Nine special evaluations for Foster Parent that ranged from\n2020 through 2023.\n• Two psychological report documents as referenced by the\nagency and Foster Parent.\n• Corrective action plans for at least eight of the special\nevaluations, with no note seen written on either corrective\naction plan by Foster Parent.\n• Closing letters/Documentation of written advisement to\nFoster Parent from the agency related to her right to submit\na written response to the respective special evaluation.\n• An Adoption Assessment completed for Foster Parent on\n6/28/2022, which denied Foster Parent’s application and\nreferenced three reference letters submitted by Foster\nParent along with the psychological document already\nreferenced in this report, and an Adult Psychological\nEvaluation from a counseling agency.\n• Documentation of courtesy access being granted to a\nrepresentative from Agency 1, Agency 2, Agency 3 and\nAgency 4.\nA copy of a 5/2/2022 screen shot of an email from Foster Parent\nto CA, Supervisor and LW to show she submitted a copy of her\npsychological report.\nSix typed letters signed by Foster Parent which she reported she\nhad submitted to the agency:\n• Two were not dated and referenced a special evaluation\nbeing initiated on 5/20/2020 and 12/16/2020 respectively.\n• Two others were dated. One referenced a special\nevaluation initiated on 5/20/2020, which Foster Parent\ndated her signature for 9/13/2020. The second for a\nspecial evaluation started on 9/9/2021, which Foster Parent\ndated her signature for 12/20/2021.\n• Two did not relate to a special evaluation. One related to\nsomething to do with a winery visit and was dated 1/2/2021.\nAnother related to staff allegedly entering her home without\nher permission and was dated 12/20/2021.\nEmail responses from CA, Supervisor, and LW on 10/24/2024\nrelated to copies of documents from/referenced by Foster Parent,\nas to whether they had seen or received these documents that\nFoster Parent indicated she had provided the agency in response\nto past special evaluations. CA acknowledged information being\ndocumented related to a doctors note with respect to Foster\nParent’s mother and the psychological note/letter from Foster\n6",
    "Parent. She, as well as Supervisor and LW denied ever seeing the\nother documents that reportedly pertained to special evaluations.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documents reviewed the\nevidence does not support the allegations. Nor that the agency did\nnot include documents from the foster parent in the foster parent’s\nlicensing file.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n10/27/2024.\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n11/4/2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n7"
