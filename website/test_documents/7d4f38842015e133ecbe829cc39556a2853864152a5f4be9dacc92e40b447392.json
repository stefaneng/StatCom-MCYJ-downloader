    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency completed an inadequate adoption family assessment as\nthey did not adequately assess alleged sexual behaviors of the\nadoptive applicant father as a part of the adoptive family\nassessment.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Complainant by phone on 02/07/2025.\nComplainant stated a referral had been made to Child Protective\nServices (CPS) involving pornography associated with the\nadoptive applicant father and CPS was not investigating the\nallegation. Complainant stated there was also a referral to law\nenforcement, but Complainant was unaware of the status of the\nreferral to law enforcement. Complainant described the nature of\nthe allegation was the adoptive applicant father had secretly\nvideotaped the adoptive applicant father's sister-in-law changing\nclothes. Complainant stated Complainant was not aware if the\nsister-in-law was an adult or minor at the time of the alleged\nvideotaping. Complainant stated Complainant did not think the\nagency assessed alleged inappropriate behaviors by the adoption\napplicant father as a part of the adoptive family assessment. At\nthe time of the complaint the adoption had been finalized.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator by phone on 02/07/2025.\nChief Administrator referred me to Program Director and provided\ncontact information for Program Director.\nI interviewed Program Director by phone on 02/13/2025.\nProgram Director was knowledgeable about the\nsituation/allegations. Program Director stated the issue was\naddressed in the adoptive family assessment as well as an\naddendum that was completed following the reported allegations.\nProgram Director stated CPS was contacted but was not\ninvestigating the allegations as reported. Program Director stated\nlaw enforcement was contacted but was unaware of the status of\nthat referral. Program Director stated the addendum to the\nadoptive family assessment was completed between the time of\nthe adoptive placement of the child and adoption finalization.\nAdoptive placement was 08/16/2024 and adoption finalization was\n02/05/2025.\nI interviewed Adoption Worker by phone on 03/26/2025.\nAdoption Worker had no concerns regarding the qualifications and\nappropriateness of the adoptive parents. Adoption Worker\n2",
    "confirmed CPS did not investigate the allegations and at this time\nAdoption Worker did not think law enforcement had pursued an\ninvestigation as Adoption Worker was not provided a case number\nor any additional related information by law enforcement to include\nin the addendum study completed by Adoption Worker.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the Adoption Family Home Study dated 06/12/2024.\nThe initial evaluation included an assessment of the adoptive\nfather applicant's behavior, characteristics, and appropriateness\nfor adoption. State criminal record clearances, FBI, DMV/SOS,\nand Central Registry Clearances were all completed with no\nconcerns identified. The determination of this assessment was\napproval for adoption.\nI reviewed the addendum to the Adoption Family Assessment\ndated 01/21/2025. The addendum was completed following the\nreported allegations by someone identified as a family friend. The\naddendum included additional details related to the behaviors of\nthe applicant adoptive father's behaviors reported in the initial\nfamily evaluation. The edited initial home study stated the\nfollowing:\nApplicant Father admits to using unwanted sexual behaviors as a\ncoping mechanism. He shared he used pornography and\nobjectified women. He had access to computer pornography his\nentire life and frequented the Tinder app to “hook up” with women.\nApplicant Father shared this with Applicant Mother, and they\nreached out to Pastor B for help. Pastor B had Applicant Father\njoin a bible study and a group whose premise is to work with those\nstruggling with pornography. Collaborating with Pastor B and the\nother men who share in this struggle has empowered Applicant\nFather and he is part of a new ministry at church that creates safe\nspace for those looking for support. He is very passionate about\nhelping others. Applicant Father continues to check in with his\naccountability partner, and there is no web browser on his phone\n– he keeps it locked out.\nThe edited addendum dated 01/21/2025 included the following:\nApplicant Father admitted himself to an in-patient treatment facility\nin November of 2024 for help with his pornography addiction.\nApplicant Father attended the Begin Again Institute for 14 days, a\ntreatment center specifically geared for those suffering with a\nsexual addiction. Applicant Father has taken his sexual addiction\n3",
    "recovery very seriously. Applicant Father disclosed his sexual\naddiction to this worker during the home study, individual interview\nin March of 2024. He was open and forthcoming about his past\ndiscretions with pornography. Applicant Father explained he once\nused pornography as a coping mechanism but had learned new\ncoping skills thanks to therapy, both individual and group.\nApplicant Father stated he had not used pornography since he\nand Applicant Mother married in October of 2019. Applicant\nFather relapsed in the early fall of 2024 and sought in-patient\ntreatment in November of 2024. Applicant Father is currently\nreceiving therapy and support from multiple sources. Applicant\nMother is also seeking therapy and support from experts as well\nas mentors familiar with being the spouse of someone suffering\nwith a Sexual Addiction.\nCharacter reference letters of support from 10 different people\nincluding professional therapists.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per interviews and\ndocuments reviewed the agency completed an addendum to\nassess adoptive applicant father after the allegations came to light\nprior to adoption occurring.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n03/26/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 27, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
