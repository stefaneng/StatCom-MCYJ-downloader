Youth A had blood on his t-shirt\nand was transported to hospital.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI spoke to Administrator 1 on 9/20/21. Allegations were discussed. Police\ninvolvement has already occurred and will be completing an investigation. Youth had\nbeen interviewed by police.\nI reviewed the following documentation throughout the course of the\ninvestigation:\n Patient Demographic Profiles\n St Joseph Mercy Oakland Emergency Medical Document\n Physical Examination Assessment\n Sexual Acting Out Precaution (SAO) Residential Round Sheet\n Observation Process (Level of Monitoring) Policy\n Program Statement\nI reviewed the Program Statement:\nHavenwyck Impulse Disorder Program is a program for male, 9-17, sex offenders and\nabuse reactive youth. It is a secure treatment program. The facility serves youth with\nsignificant mental health issues and sexually impulsive behaviors…\nI observed the video on 9/20/21. The video being observed is dated 9/18/21 starting\nat 19:46:48.\n3",
    "***It is to be noted that the youth were in the hallway completing medication distribution,\nshowers, and laundry during the time of the incident.\n19:46:48: Youth A is standing against the wall, and exposes himself to Youth B across\nthe hallway\n19:48:11: Staff 1 is in the hallway\n19:48:31: Supervisor 1 unlocks the bathroom door\n19:48:36: Supervisor 1 leaves the area and goes down to Classroom A hallway; Youth A\nis at staff desk\n19:49:19: Supervisor 1 comes back into the previous area with Staff 1\n19:49:37: Supervisor 1 leaves the hallway and goes out the door (leaving the area)\n19:50:00: Supervisor 1 comes back into the area and goes back down Classroom A\nhallway\n19:50:44: Youth A goes into unlocked bathroom door\n19:51:39: Youth A opens bathroom door, steps out and then goes back into the bathroom\nthen closes the door\n19:52:27: Youth B goes into bathroom\n19:56:13: Staff 2 comes into hallway looking for Youth A\n19:56:44: Staff 2 knocks on bathroom door, then leaves\n19:57:19: Youth A came out of bathroom\n19:57:27: Staff 2 comes back into the area\n19:57:44: Staff 2 unlocks the bathroom door\n***Youth A was in the restroom approximately 7.5 minutes. Youth B was in the bathroom\napproximately 5 minutes. They were both in the bathroom together for approximately 5\nminutes.\nI reviewed Youth B’s Sexual Acting Out Precaution (SAO) Residential Round Sheet:\nYouth B is listed as having “Sexual Acting Out Precautions” (SAO). His level of monitoring\nby staff is to have 15-minute checks but also “direct observation” (line of sight) at all times.\n(All youth are required the 15-minute checks unless more intensive monitoring is\nrequired).\nI reviewed the Observation Process (level of Monitoring) Policy:\nWhen patients are evaluated to determine if there is a need for specific precaution,\ntwo decision points will be made by the physician 1) precaution and will order 2)\nlevel of monitoring appropriate for each patient.\nNote: Every patient’s observed location and behavior is documented within 15\nminutes…If the patient requires more intensive monitoring than the 15-minute\nchecks, the physician will order either Line of Sight or Arm’s Length level of\nmonitoring (with an assigned 1:1 staff.)\n4",
    "Direct Observation:\n1. The patient is monitored continuously, with a direct line of sight always, by an\nassigned staff member, including when the patient is using the bathroom or\nshower. There should not be any form of barrier between the staff and the\npatient, such as a desk or counter.\nI spoke to Administrator 2 on 1/4/22. Administrator 2 reported the policies for the\nresidential facility are from the hospital program; therefore, the 1:1 is not actually meant\nfor the residential program. Administrator 2 reported there are not separate policies for\nthe residential. Administrator 2 agreed this part of the policy will need to be updated to\nreflect the residential programs supervision.\nCAREHOUSE interviewed Youth A on 10/4/21. Youth A reported he told Staff 1 he\nflashed his peer. Youth A reported he went to the bathroom without permission from staff.\nYouth A reported he did not close the door the entire way. Youth A reported Youth B\ncame into the bathroom, and he attempted to scream but Youth B placed his hand over\nhis mouth. Youth A reported Youth B pulled his pants down and “penetrated me”. Youth\nA reported Youth B put his penis in his butt.\nI reviewed the Auburn Hills Police Department report.\nAuburn Hills Police Department attempted to interview Youth B on 10/25/21 but he\nrefused to talk to them.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 on 10/7/21 via telephone. Supervisor 1 reported she was\nmonitoring the youth while relieving staff members for breaks. She relieved Staff 1 for a\nbreak. Supervisor 1 reported there were four youth with on the unit at the time. Youth A\nand Youth B were two of the four youth. Supervisor 1 reported they were taking showers\none at a time. Supervisor 1 reported she was standing in the nursing station, so she had\nline of sight of showers and the youth in the hallway. Supervisor 1 reported she received\na personal phone call from the nursing station. Supervisor1 reported she answered the\nphone. Supervisor1 reported that Staff 2, who was assigned to work in another unit came\ninto the hallway and dropped off two more youth. Supervisor 1 reported when Staff 2\ndropped of the two youth, Youth A was on the side of the medical cart. (The medical cart\nwas in between Supervisor 1 and Youth A) Supervisor 1 reported Staff 2 took one of the\nyouths to the restroom and then Staff 1 came back from her break. Supervisor 1 reported\nshe was then asked by one of the other youths to get aspirin. Supervisor 1 reported she\nwent to the medication cart and retrieved the aspirin. Supervisor 1 reported then going\nback to the classroom to “drop off” a youth with his group. Supervisor 1 reported when\nshe got back, she heard Staff 1 state, “Where is Youth A?” Supervisor 1 reported they\nthen did a head count and discovered both Youth A and B were missing. Staff 2 then\nunlocked the bathroom door and found the youth. Supervisor 1 reported there were too\nmany activities going on at the same time (referring to the showers, medication, and\nlaundry). Supervisor 1 admitted they (Staff 1 and Supervisor 1) should have had more\ncommunication between breaks and completed a head count before break as well.\nSupervisor 1 reported they do not have a policy on the structure of activities.\n5",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 on 10/8/21 via telephone. Staff 1 was the only direct care worker on\nduty for this unit. Staff 1 reported she was with the unit, and they were completing\nshowers at the time. Staff 1 reported she was relieved by Supervisor 1 for a restroom\nbreak. Staff 1 reported when she returned, she couldn’t find Youth A. Staff 1 reported the\nphone rang and she picked it up. Staff 1 reported Youth B asked to use the bathroom and\nshe gave him permission. Staff 1 reported she was not aware that Youth A was in the\nbathroom. Staff 1 reported the bathroom door is usually locked but because she was\ndoing showers, she unlocked the bathroom door earlier. Staff 1 reported she had to be in\nthe hallway monitoring showers (by looking into the room) and then monitor the youth in\nthe hallway and monitor the bathroom. Staff 1 reported if she would have to unlock the\nbathroom door, she would no longer have line of sight of the showers and all in the\nhallway. Staff 1 reported when they found Youth A, he had blood stains on his shirt and\non his underwear.\nI reviewed the Physical Examination Assessment. Assessment concluded Youth A had a\nlinear tear to anal area.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: During a CareHouse interview Youth A reported that he was\nanally penetrated by Youth B. Youth A also sustained a linear\nanal tear.\nYouth B is listed as having “Sexual Acting Out Precautions”\n(SAO). According to the polices and procedures submitted by the\nfacility Youth B should have been on 1:1 supervision. Youth B\nwas to have direct observation as outlined in his SAO. Youth B\nwas to have an assigned 1:1 staff to perform this level of\nobservation. Staff 1 was the only staff supervising four youth.\nThis is contrary to the “Sexual Acting out Precautions,” as\ndescribed in their programming. Additionally, 1 staff was not\nsufficient to provide for the needs, protection and supervision of\nthese youth as required by this rule.\nTechnical Administrator 2 reported the policy doesn’t reflect the current\nAssistance operational standards in the residential program. The current\nprogram does not have 1:1 staffing for youth on direct observation\nstatus. Policy and practice must match. If the facility is not going\nto provide the 1:1 supervision as “Sexual Acting Out Precautions,\nit should not be included in their programming. Even if the 1:1\nsupervision is not part of the programming, it has been\ndetermined that the 1 staff person supervising the 4 youth as they\ncompleted various activities is not sufficient.\nCONCLUSION VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program Statement\nAn institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: This investigation revealed that two youth were able to get into\nthe bathroom together and engage in sexual behavior. During\nthat time staff were attempting to supervise showers, pass\nmedication and supervise laundry. Staff’s inability to supervise\nall these activities contributed to the youth being able to get into\nthe bathroom together.\nThe agency does not have specific policies and procedures\naround pertaining to how the facility is to provide for the safety\nand supervision of youth during showers as required by this rule.\n.\nTECHNICAL It would benefit the agency to establish a schedule with less\nASSISTANCE activities occurring at one time. This would provide for the safety\nof youth as required by this rule. Multiple activities occurring at\nonce, may hinder line of sight supervision. Because of the\npopulation in the agency, heightened supervision may be needed\noften and too many activities will cause distractions allowing\nopportunities for an unsafe environment.\nCONCLUSION VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nA. It is recommended that the license remain unchanged upon approval of an\nacceptable cap.\n12/29/21\n________________________________________\nVenus M.
