EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\n3",
    "The CAP, approved 5/1/23, was the result of the 4/12/23 renewal evaluation. The\nagency had violations regarding timely adoption evaluations, medical passports,\nand family team meetings. The agency reported successfully implementing their\nCAP over the past year, which led to improvement in all areas. However, there\nwas one repeat violation during the current review, regarding an FTM that was not\ncompleted timely. This repeat was found in only one case. Overall, the agency has\nshown compliance with their 2023 CAP.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment dated 9/22/2023 was reviewed and\ndiscussed on-site. The CA reported ongoing efforts to improve compliance,\nincluding random file audits, the use of Infoview for tracking, and implementation\nof internal tracking spreadsheets. The agency reported improvement in all Key\nPerformance Indicator areas. However, the CA did identify FTMs as an area\nwhere improvement is needed.\nThe CA indicated there were four unplanned moves for youth during the past year.\nOne move was a result of a child going AWOL. Three moves were due to safety\nconcerns with the child’s relative caregivers.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency's 2022 financial audit was reviewed, as the 2023 review is not yet\ncomplete. The agency's 2023 budget was also reviewed. No financial concerns\nwere found.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site: one supervisor and one caseworker. Both staff\nreported they felt supported in their positions with the agency. Both staff stated\ntheir supervisors and administrator are knowledgeable, helpful, and resourceful.\nStaff stated they work well with co-workers and feel their efforts are valued in the\nteam. Staff did not have any concerns or suggestions for improvements at the\nagency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same office building as previous years.\nThere is adequate space for staff and clients to meet and hold parenting time. The\noffice has sufficient secure storage for confidential information.\n4",
