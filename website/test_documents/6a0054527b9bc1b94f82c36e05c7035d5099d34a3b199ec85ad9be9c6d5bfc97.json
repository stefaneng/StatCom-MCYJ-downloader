TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Timeframes for document completion, medical exams, dentals, school\nenrollment, etc. start the day a youth is admitted to the facility and continue\nfrom that date unless youth is discharged from the facility. If youth go to a\njuvenile facility, they should be discharged from Footprints. Then if they\ncome back to the facility, the youth would be considered a brand-new\nreadmission, and timeframes would start over from the date they're\nreadmitted.\n• If the youth will be gone from the facility for more than a few days, the\nagency should consider discharging them if timeframes are not going to be\nmet.\n• Youth signatures on the treatment plans are option, but discussion with the\nyouth about their treatment plan needs to be documented somewhere in\nthe file (i.e. contact sheet, team meeting, signature on the treatment plan,\netc.)\n• Agency should screenshot onboarding screen for new employees to\nprovide verification they signed off on their job description and add the\nscreenshot to the employee file.\nV.

EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThere was one CAP during the period of review as a result of the agency's 2023\nrenewal audit. The agency had violations for late, incomplete, or not signed\ntreatment plans, and discharge plans. To address the agency implemented steps\nwhich included monthly file audits, a tracking sheet within the file to confirm auditing\nis taking place, a new treatment plan template requiring two staff signatures, and\nthe utilization of calendar reminders to ensure timely completion of service plans.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's budget and financial audit were reviewed, and no concerns were\nnoted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted things are going very well at the agency right now.\nShe noted the supervisor position was open for 6 months, but was filled in July,\nwhich was a positive change. CA noted there has been a lot of staff turnover, but\nthey have filled the positions, and even have more on call staff now as well. CA\nnoted high risk residents were the cause of most of the turnover in the spring, but\nthey have continued to demonstrate support for staff and increased safety for youth\nas problems arise. CA noted they will continue holding weekly leadership meetings\nand monthly file audits to ensure compliance with the rules.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported the program is good and very strengths based. Everyone supports\neach other because it is a small staff network. Upper management and supervisors\nfill in on shifts and responsibilities whenever needed, which also adds to staff\nsupport. There is open communication, which is very important for the youth and\nstaff. Any safety issues, training needs, or changes in policy/procedure are well\n5",
    "communicated. Staff mentioned the medication tracking process could be\nimproved, but stated there is already progress in this area.\nYouth reported they felt safe at the agency and staff were really nice. They reported\nthey feel supported by staff and could talk to them if they had a problem. Youth\nreported they have enough food and like the food provided. There were no\nconcerns noted.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on 8/28/24, and there were no concerns\nnoted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nSeptember 30, 2024\nShannon Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 1, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
