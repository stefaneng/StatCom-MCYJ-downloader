The CA indicated the agency struggled with respect to\nkey performance indicators (KPI) around medicals and dentals; service plan\ncompletions/approvals; and worker/parent, and parent/child contacts. The CA\nreported the agency continues to work to improve all of these areas. To increase\ncompliance the agency added a health care coordinator, training and supervisor\ncalendar reminders, workers are encouraged to utilize the BOB (Book of\nBusiness) for report timeframes, and working on assisting birth parent with\ntransportation so they can participate in parenting times.\nThe CA reported the corrective action plan has produced positive results overall\nas staff are utilizing training, the Department’s/agency’s resources, and utilization\nof Microsoft Outlook and the BOB. Additionally, it has held the supervisors\naccountable for documentation support to staff and follow up related to tasks.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a 2023-2024 annual budget, as well as a 9/30/2023 agency\nindependent financial audit. No major concerns were noted.\n12",
    "Staff Interviews\nIn addition to discussion with the program director, licensee designee, program\nmanager, three supervisors (licensing, adoption, foster care), a quality assurance\nanalyst, and two human resource staff during the entrance conference, one foster\ncare worker, one independent living worker, one licensing worker, and one\nadoption worker were interviewed.\nThe workers reported positives about the agency with respect the agency’s family-\noriented environment, team work amongst it staff; and the communication and\nsupport the agency displays to workers, foster parents, and the foster children and\ntheir families. An area of needed growth reported by workers was for greater staff\nretention, increased pay, more structured supervision for some new workers in the\nbeginning even id that staff comes with past experience. Additionally, for the\nagency to have the ability to provide more in house therapy and mental health\ntreatment for youths over 18.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility showed the agency has sufficient space and\nequipment. Additionally, case records for each program were securely stored. No\nsafety issues or concerns were observed.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts.\nRECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nApril 28, 2024\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 7, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n13"
