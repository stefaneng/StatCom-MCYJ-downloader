Once the adoptive\nfamily provides the agency with required documentation, the family signs a\n“Contract” which outlines the agreement between the adoptive parents and agency.\nFor the purpose of child welfare licensing, the agency’s “Contract” with the adoptive\nfamily serves as the application pertaining to the requirements of this rule. The\nagency must include the “Contract” signature date on the adoptive family home\nstudy to determine the 90-day start date.\nVI.
