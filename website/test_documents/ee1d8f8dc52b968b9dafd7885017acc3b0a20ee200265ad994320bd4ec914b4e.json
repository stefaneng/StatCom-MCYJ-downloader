Administrator 1 stated State\nWorker 1 has seen Youth A, but has not interviewed Youth A. Administrator 1 stated\n2",
    "Youth A has been in placement at this facility previously for approximately 6 months and\nwas replaced to this facility in February or March of 2020. Administrator 1 stated there\nwas no video available of the incident.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 01/08/2021 with State Worker 1. Youth A stated\nshe was frustrated with the staff regarding a “0” on the facility point system. Youth A\nstated she walked around outside and came back into the unit. Youth A said when she\ncame into the unit she was still upset and tipped over a cubby and started to walk out\nagain into another peer’s personal aisle. Youth A stated staff approached Youth A and\nYouth A curled up into a ball, sitting on the floor with her legs bent, knees up, and arms\nwrapped around her legs. Youth A stated Staff 1 grabbed the back of Youth A’s shirt\nand scooted/dragged Youth A across the floor 3-5 ft. out of the other peer’s personal\naisle. Youth A said she started shouting and another staff came over and talked Youth\nA into calming down. Youth A stated she wasn’t hurt, but she was sent to the doctor the\nnext morning anyway.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 01/08/2021 with State Worker 1. Staff 1 described\nthe incident similar to the description reported by Youth A. Staff 1 stated Youth A was\nredirected numerous times when Youth A was upset about receiving a “0” for an\nimproper use of Youth A’s mask. Staff 1 stated Staff 4 also tried to de-escalate Youth\nA. Staff 1 stated Youth A left the unit and Youth A came back into the unit with Staff 1.\nStaff 1 stated that Youth A picked up a chair and threw it, tipped over a cubby, threw\nanother chair, threw glasses, and started to pull Youth A’s own hair out. Staff 1 stated\nthey moved toward Youth A and was going to put Youth A in a standing hold, but Youth\nA dropped to the floor and curled up in a sitting position. Staff 1 stated she talked to\nYouth A and then grabbed the shoulder part of Youth A’s shirt and pulled Youth A out of\nthe area. Staff 1 said it was a tile floor and she was able to pull/slide Youth A 4-5 ft. to\nget out of the area. Staff 1 stated Staff 3 then came and talked to Youth A who calmed\ndown and Youth A got up on her own and went to her own bunk area. Staff 1 stated\nshe has worked with Youth A since the incident with no problems. Staff 1 stated she\nhas not had any other confrontations with Youth A and Staff 1 has tried to minimize her\ncontact with Youth A. Staff 1 stated she was aware this was not a method consistent\nwith her restraint training of the facility.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 01/08/2021 with State Worker 1. Staff 2 described\nthe incident similar to the descriptions reported by Youth A and Staff 1. Staff 2 stated\nthey were on their way to dinner and Youth A received a “0” for an hour. Staff 2 stated\nYouth A was upset, left the unit, and Youth A returned to the unit with Staff 1 and Staff\n4. Staff 2 stated when Youth A returned to the unit Youth A threw a chair and ripped\nsome of her own hair out. Staff 2 stated she blocked Youth A from attempting to exit\nagain and Staff 1 also attempted to block Youth A from leaving. Staff 2 stated Youth A\nthen ran to another area and curled up on the floor. Staff 2 stated Staff 1 grabbed the\nback of Youth A’s shirt and moved Youth A 3-4 ft. across the tile floor. Staff 2 stated\nYouth A didn’t say she was hurt, only that she was choked by the T-Shirt. Staff 2 stated\nYouth A eventually got up on her own and went to Youth A’s own area. Staff 2 stated\nshe did not see any marks or bruises on Youth A following the incident.\n3",
    "I interviewed Youth B at the facility on 01/08/2021 with State Worker 1. Youth B was a\npeer witness to the incident. Youth B stated Youth A was in Youth B’s personal aisle\nand Staff 1 and Staff 2 tried to put Youth A in a standing restraint, but Youth A curled up\non the floor. Youth B stated Staff 1 grabbed Youth A’s shirt and pulled Youth A out of\nYouth B’s area. Youth B stated Youth A was yelling, but Youth A was not hurt. Youth B\nstated she feels safe with Staff 1 and described Staff 1 as good staff.\nI participated in a telephone conference on 01/26/2021 with State Worker 1, her\nsupervisor and Youth A’s probation officer. Youth A’s probation officer reported no\nconcerns for Youth A. The safety plan that was implemented following this incident was\nthat Staff 1 would not be alone with Youth A and other staff would dispense medications\nfor Youth A.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: The findings of this investigation determined that Staff 1 did\nhave inappropriate contact with Youth A by grabbing the shirt of\nYouth A and pulling Youth A a short distance across the floor.\nYouth A was not injured, but this is not an acceptable or taught\nrestraint method of this facility. Staff 1 admitted in her interview\nthat she was aware her actions were inconsistent with her\ntraining.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend with the submission and acceptance of an approved corrective action\nplan the current license status of this child care institution-private be maintained.\n03/03/2021\n________________________________________\nMark R.
