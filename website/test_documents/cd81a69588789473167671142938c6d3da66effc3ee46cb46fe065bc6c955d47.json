    "12/09/2022 Exit conference\nALLEGATION:\nYouth Z stole keys from Methodist and ran away allegedly because he was afraid\nafter Staff 1 threatened to have people come to the facility, beat him, and shoot\nhim.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received by DCWL on 11/9/22. The complainant, who is also foster\ncare staff, was notified via email and provided the current location of the youth.\nOn 11/9/22, Chief Administrator 1 clarified the car keys stolen were taken from the child\nplacing agency’s office building and not from the residential facility. However, as an\nadded precaution, both programs installed lock boxes on 11/11/22 where they now\nstore the keys.\nOn 11/10/22 at 10:55am, I interviewed Youth Z, age 12, jointly with Government\nWorker 1 in a hospital emergency room in Lansing. He had been there for a few days\nawaiting a psychiatric evaluation. I introduced myself and the government worker.\nYouth Z was asleep and became irritated and refused to wake up for an interview. We\nleft the room for a few minutes then returned and tried again. Youth Z still refused to\nwake up and talk to us. I asked him what the staff at Methodist said or did that caused\nhim to run away. Youth Z shouted angrily, “Nothing. Nothing.”\nOn 12/5/22, Government Worker 1 interviewed Youth Z again in the emergency room.\nAt that time, he stated that Staff 1 had threatened him three months prior to this\ncomplaint, on 8/7/22, just before he AWOLed. He alleged that Staff 1 cussed at and\nthreatened Youths O and B as well but would not specify what Staff 1 said. Youth Z\nalso claimed that after he returned from one of his AWOLs, an unidentified staff refused\nto let him into the cottage.\nGovernment Worker 1 asked Youth Z how he stole a Methodist vehicle. He told her he\nleft the campus, returned later, broke into Methodist’s child placing agency office\nbuilding and stole car keys. Youth Z was found by police driving the child placing\nagency’s vehicle in the community and was brought back to the residential program.\nMethodist’s residential staff did not see the youth return to the property or take the\nvehicle belonging to the child placing agency.\n3",
    "I reviewed Youth Z’s AWOL incident report dated 8/7/22 at 6:20pm authored by Staff 3.\nThe report indicated “No known triggers. Youth Z sat down, ate dinner, walked around\nthe cottage…then he walked out of the cottage with Staff 3 behind him. Youth returned\nto the cottage at 10pm, was searched by staff with no further issues.”\nI requested Youth Z’s AWOL history. Records indicate Youth Z was admitted to\nMethodist Children’s Home on 8/1/22 and AWOLed eleven times in the three months he\nwas there. He left the campus without permission and returned or was brought back by\nstaff within an hour on 9/6/22, 9/11/22, 10/11/22 and 10/25/22. He left the campus for\nover an hour and missing person’s reports were filed on 8/7/22, 9/7/22, 9/27/22,\n10/3/22, 11/2/22, 11/5/22 and 11/6/22. Chief Administrator (CA) was unaware of any\ntimes when staff refused to allow Youth Z back into the cottage after he returned from\nAWOL.\nI interviewed Staff 1 collaboratively with Government Worker 1. She has worked at the\nfacility for four years but has only worked with Youth Z for the last two months. Staff 1\ndescribed Youth Z as “difficult, physically aggressive, AWOLs every day, and does not\nfollow rules.” On 11/6/22, she said Youth Z woke up, used the bathroom, and took his\nmedication. “Next (from the window) I saw him walking across the campus.” Staff 1\nand Staff 2 were both in the cottage. Staff 1 denied threatening Youth Z in any way\nbefore he walked away. She also denied hearing Staff 2 threaten him.\nI interviewed Staff 2 collaboratively with Government Worker 1 via telephone. She has\nworked midnight shift at the facility for 21 years. Staff 2 said she did not recall Youth Z\nAWOLing on 11/6/22, adding “He’s AWOLed so many times.” Staff 2 denied ever\nthreatening Youth Z and also denied ever hearing Staff 1 threaten him.\nI interviewed Youth B collaboratively with Government Worker 1. He refused to provide\nhis birthdate or any other information.\nI interviewed Youth E, age 10, collaboratively with Government Worker 1. He resided\nin the same cottage as Youth Z. Youth E described Youth Z as “horrible, he physically\nfights staff.” He denied ever hearing any staff threaten Youth Z. Youth E described\nStaff 1 as “nice.”\nOn 12/7/22, the foster care worker expressed a new concern that Youth Z was not\nsearched or not searched properly upon returning from AWOL on 11/6/22.\nI reviewed Youth Z’s AWOL return report dated 11/6/22 at 2:30am authored by Midnight\nSupervisor. The report indicated “Walled Lake Police brought Youth Z back to the\ncampus. Writer searched Youth Z, escorted him inside then he went to his room to bed\nfor the night.”\nI reviewed the facility’s search policy. It indicates “direct care staff can search a youth\nupon his return from AWOL. There are two types of searches – Level 1 and Level 2.\n4",
    "Level 1 search is least restrictive: this is a ‘soft’ search and always occurs prior to a\nLevel 2 search.\n• Ask the young person to flip out the inside of pockets\n• Ask the young person to empty backpack\n• Allow staff to visually inspect backpack as needed.\nLevel 2 search: This is a more restrictive approach based upon positive findings on\nLevel 1, resistance or continued probable cause. This is completed by the shift\nsupervisor or another residential supervisor and can include a pat-down search.\n• Always use the back (not front) of your hands utilizing rubber gloves as needed\n• Ask the young person to flip or undo waistbands while staff observes\n• Ask the youth person to remove shoes – Staff should visually inspect each shoe for\ncontraband\n• Ask socks to be removed for visual inspection as well\nThere was no evidence Midnight Supervisor failed to follow the search protocol.\nI interviewed Youth O at school on 12/08/22. He resided in the same cottage as Youth\nZ. Youth O described Youth Z as a “mean bully” who AWOLed a lot. He denied Staff 1\nthreatens or cusses at him or other children. He also denied that any staff refuse to let\nchildren inside the cottage when they return from AWOL.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency’s\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Methodist’s child caring institution staff are not responsible for\nsupervising youth who leave the property and sneak back on\ncampus unnoticed. They also are not responsible for\nsafeguarding the building, keys or vehicles belonging to the\nchild placing agency.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\n(1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow\nwritten policies and procedures that prohibit the following\nforms of intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but\nnot limited to:\n(iii) Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or\notherwise suggesting physical or emotional harm to a\nyouth.\nANALYSIS: Initially Youth Z denied any staff threatened him or caused him\nto AWOL from the facility on 11/6/22. Several weeks later he\nclaimed that Staff 1 threatened him before he AWOLed on\n8/7/22. All youth and staff interviewed denied hearing Staff 1\nthreaten Youth Z or any other youth at any time.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend this facility continue its current licensing status.\n12/14/2022\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n12/22/2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n6"
