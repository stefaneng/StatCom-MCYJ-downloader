    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nDescription service policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth are taken to the hospital and proper information is not\navailable and provided.\nInvestigation The Chief Administrator was interviewed on 02/20/2024 during\nan unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated she\nhad not personally accompanied any youth to the hospital at that\ntime because she was still transitioning from a Social Service\nWorker position to the Chief Administrator position. The Chief\nAdministrator did state there was a procedure within the program\nfor staff to take a youth’s log book with them when they are\ntransported or accompany a youth to the hospital.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 02/29/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. She reviewed the procedure that\nwas provided to Licensing from the Chief Administrator and stated\nshe could not recall seeing that specific document or specific\ninstruction. Staff 1 stated she was familiar with the practice of\ntaking medical insurance, health history and legal status\ninformation to medical providers when accompanying youth. Staff\n1 believed she was taught to do this by the previous Chief\nAdministrator. Staff 1 stated she had been with youth at the local\nhospital on several occasions and never failed to have proper\ninformation that the hospital or mental health staff would need to\nprovide services to the youth.\nYouth A was interviewed on 02/29/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. She stated she has had to go to\nthe hospital a few times during her placement at the facility for\nmedications and during times of crisis. Youth A could not recall\nwho accompanied her to the hospital, but she believed staff had\nher “case file” with them to provide information to staff there.\n2",
    "Youth B was interviewed on 02/29/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. Youth B believed staff brought\nnecessary information with them to visits to the hospital and\nmedical providers but could not recall any specific details on those\ninstances.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed on 02/29/2024 during an\nunannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated she was\ntrained since the beginning of her employment to take “the book”\nwith her if she accompanied a youth to the hospital or a medical\nappointment, and she believed she had done that “most of the\ntime.” Supervisor 1 stated that essential information such as legal\nstatus and insurance was always contained in this book. She\nstated she recently learned about the card that is provided for\neach youth placed in the program that outlines consent to treat for\nyouth in the child welfare system.\nStaff 3 was interviewed on 03/07/2024 during an announced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 3 stated she has taken\nseveral youth to medical appointments and to the hospital for\nmedication refills and for crisis needs and she has never\naccompanied the youth without their “book” to provide medical\nand legal information to the service provider. When asked\nspecifically about an instance in November 2023 where she\ntransported a youth to the hospital, Staff 3 stated she could not\nrecall the specific date, but she would not have transported the\nyouth without the required information. She stated she had seen\nthe specific document that was provided to Licensing that outlined\nthe facility procedures for this activity. Staff 3 stated there have\nbeen times of confusion during these visits because youth in the\nprogram often refer to her as “Grandma”, and she believed this\nwas done in part due to embarrassment of the youth and not\nwanting it known where they are placed. Staff 3 stated she has\ntried to correct this to avoid confusion but did not want to\nembarrass the youth, either.\nYouth C was interviewed on 03/13/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. She stated she had been\ntransported to the hospital on one occasion during her time placed\nat the facility, but this was done by law enforcement.

She\nstated that there were several times she had to be taken to the\nhospital during her previous time placed at the program. Youth D\n3",
    "recalled that the Licensee Designee took her more than once and\nbelieved other staff had as well. Youth D believed there were\ntimes when she was at the hospital for services provided by local\nCommunity Mental Health’s Crisis team and there was not proper\ninformation provided by facility staff to the service\nproviders. Youth D could not provide any further detail on what\nshe recalled.\nThe Licensee Designee was interviewed over the phone on\n03/15/2024. She stated there had been several occasions where\nshe accompanied youth to medical appointments or to the local\nhospital for crisis services or needs for medication\nmanagement. The Licensee Designee stated she could not\nspecifically recall any dates where there had been concern\npresented on proper information not being brought in for the\nneeds of the service providers at the hospital, including the\nspecific date in January 2024 regarding a hospital visit with Youth\nD. She recalled the normal practice to be calling the caseworker\nfor a youth during business hours or calling the on-call line for that\nyouth’s local home county when there was a need to take the\nyouth to the hospital.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Administration staff from Saginaw County Community\nMental Health (CMH) provided documentation as follows:\no Two specific examples of instances where youth\nwere brought to the local hospital and CMH staff\nprovided crisis-oriented services to the youth were\nprovided:\n▪ It was summarized that a previously placed\nyouth in the program was brought to the\nemergency room by Staff 3 on\n11/05/2023. This was within an hour of CMH\nstaff taking a phone call from facility staff\ninquiring about an urgent need to fill\nprescription medications for this youth\nthrough the emergency room and crisis\nservices. CMH staff reported Staff 3 did not\nhave any information on consents or legal\nstatus of the youth to provide to them when\nthey were present at the hospital. At that\npoint CMH staff made efforts to contact the\nyouth’s caseworker to gain the required\ninformation. This youth was then brought to\nthe hospital again for medication needs on\n11/13/2023 and 11/14/2023 without proper\n4",
    "information on medication history, consents\nand legal status. CMH reported they worked\nwith the facility and gained that information for\nthis youth as of 11/16/2023.\n▪ It was summarized that Youth D was\ntransported to the local hospital emergency\nroom by the Licensee Designee on\n01/15/2024. CMH staff reported the Licensee\nDesignee did not have any information\navailable at this time to inform of consent to\ntreat or legal status. CMH staff then made\nphone calls to on-call staff (due to the federal\nholiday) from the youth’s local county to gain\nthat information.\no A checklist provided to child caring institution staff\nand administration by CMH on 02/23/2024 titled\n“DHHS Foster Care and CCI Requirements” that\noutlined the required documentation that would be\nneeded for the provision of their services.\n▪ A supporting document was provided which\nprovided more detail specific to crisis needs\ntitled “List of Required Documents when\nPresenting Youth to CIS/Emergency Room.”\n• Facility policy & procedure titled “Hospital Instructions” was\nprovided and reviewed. In this policy it outlined that staff\nwere required to take the youth’s record book with them to\naccompany the youth and were to ensure that the consent\nto treat card and face sheet containing demographic\ninformation was included.\no This policy & procedure did not have a date included\non it and was not included in the previously provided\nfull document of all policy and procedures through\nthe original Licensure process. The Chief\nAdministrator and Licensee Designee could not\nconfirm when it was created or how it was distributed\nto staff for their instruction. It was noted that the\ndocument was provided to Licensing on 02/26/2024\nand within it has a created date of 02/24/2024.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nprovided by both the facility and the local mental health provider\nreviewed there was evidence found the facility did not follow their\nown policies on providing required information at the time of need\nfor service with crisis mental health services.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
