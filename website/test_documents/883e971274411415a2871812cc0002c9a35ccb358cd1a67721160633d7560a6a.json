Staff\n2 denied any of the youth telling him this. Staff 2 said the boys were \"googly eyed\"\nfor her, but he never had any conversation with Youth C about a kiss. Staff 2\nadmitted he texted Staff 1 to tell her to be careful because the boys always wanted\nto be around her. He told her to watch out as it will be her word against theirs. His\ntext to Staff 1 was because he was worried someone would allege something\nagainst her and it would be her word against the youths. Staff 2 said the boys were\nflirtatious around her. He said Staff 1 would redirect the boys, but Staff 1 would also\nhug the youth. Staff 2 said if he had known about anything inappropriate, he would\nhave done something. He would have written an Incident report and notified the\nSupervisor.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at her home along with the DHHS Worker. She\nsaid she was terminated because Youth D sat on her lap or rather on the chair\nbetween her legs. Staff 1 said she would braid his hair and he sat there for about 5-\n10 minutes. This occurred in the basement. Staff 1 said Youth D just sat there. She\nsaid she told him to move but he refused. She did not think him sitting on her lap\nwas appropriate.

Staff 1 said that\nYouth C would try to kiss her a lot, but she would move out of the way. Youth D told\nher he would leave his girlfriend for her, and Staff 1 told him it was inappropriate.\nYouth D had asked to talk to her in private, so they went into the room off the living\nroom. Staff 1 said that after talking they stood up and Youth D kissed her. It lasted\nabout 2 seconds then she walked out. She did not tell anyone. Youth D would often\nbrush up against her. Staff 1 refused to be interviewed further.\nTour:\nA tour of the facility found two counseling rooms. One is directly off the main\nhallway. It does not have a camera in it. It does have the staff bathroom and a\ncloset/storage room in it. Across the hall from the counseling room is the living\nroom/dining room. There is another counseling room off the living room that does not\nhave a camera. There are three dorm rooms in the facility: two for boys and one for\ngirls. There are not any cameras in the dorms. The staff room is off the main\nhallway. It does not have any cameras. This is where they store youth belongings\nand staff documents. The basement door is off the main hallway next to the living\nroom. Once coming down the stairs there is a classroom set up and on the far end of\nthe room is a living room area with a TV. On the backside of the stairs is a room that\ncreates a corner at the far right that cannot be seen by the camera. This area has\nshelves with games on them. The blind corner can be seen by all seats in the living\nroom area. The doors to the counseling rooms, basement, and staff rooms are\nlocked from the outside.\nVideo Reviewed:\nSome of the incidents viewed by the supervisor were no longer available and some\nof the videos he provided froze and skipped time. It was often difficult to distinguish\nbetween the male youth in the videos. The following videos were able to be\nreviewed:\n 5/18/22: The video is of the upstairs living room. It shows Staff 1 siting in the\nliving room with several youth. The group appears to be siting around talking.\nStaff 1 frisks a male youth (it could not be determined what youth) which\nincludes touching his butt. She then frisks Youth A, pulling her close. A male\nyouth then frisks another male youth.\n 5/20/22: This video shows the upstairs living room. Staff 1 is sitting on the\ncouch. A few times Staff 1 leans into the youth who is sitting next to her, but it\nis not clear if they are whispering to each other or kissing. Another youth\ntouches her head. The male youth all try to be close to her even if they have\nto stand near her. At 7:38pm Staff 1 goes into the counseling room off the\nliving room with Youth D. They come out at 7:56pm.\n 5/21/22: These videos show the basement. The group is all in the living room\narea. Staff 1 sits at the end of the right couch next to the game corner. The\nmale youth all crowd around Staff 1 even if they have to stand or sit on\n10",
    "another youth’s lap. Because Staff 1 is in the far corner, it is hard to see what\nis going on. Staff 1 gets up and moves to a chair facing the TV. Two youth sit\non either side of her. Several times throughout the video it looks as though\nStaff 1 and one of the youth next to her are kissing or whispering into each\nother’s ears. This occurs with the youth on her other side as well.\n 5/23/22: This video is of the basement. The group is in the living room area\nwatching TV. Staff 1 is sitting in a chair facing the TV. Staff 2 sits next to her\nand the boys all crowd around her, moving chairs so they can be near her.\nThe youth who sits behind Staff 1 plays with her hair, pulls her chair toward\nhim, and leans forward toward her. Staff 2 is turned in Staff 1’s direction. A\ncouple of times Staff 1 throws a pillow at a youth and hits another one upside\nthe head several times as he leans toward her. Throughout the video some of\nthe youth go in and out of the game corner. The group starts to get up and\nsome go upstairs as others clean up. Some of the male youth go into the\ngame corner. Staff 1 follows them. Staff 1 can be seen leaning into the\ncorner. At one point one of the male youths comes out and puts his arm\naround her and they stand leaning into the corner, so their heads are not\nseen.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nSupervisor’s timeline of events:\n Video Footage reviewed by the Supervisor:\no 5/14/22 at 3:36pm: Youth D sits on Staff 1’s lap. At 3:44 the basement\ndoor opens and Staff 1 pushes Youth D off her lap until she realizes it\nis just another youth then Youth D sits back on her lap.
