INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10177 Resident Restraint\nSection (1) The facility shall establish and follow written policy and\nDescription procedures specifying the use of resident restraint.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was restrained. Youth has fractured wrist. It is unknown if\nthe fracture was a result of the restraint.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via\ntelephone on 1/17/23 as well as face to face on-site at the\nfacility in conjunction with the MDHHS on 1/19/23. During the\ninterview on 1/19/23, Assistant Superintendent was also\npresent. Within days prior to Youth A arriving at the facility, he\nwas in a car accident, but the facility was not made aware of the\naccident when he was admitted. Due to lack of notification, they\nfollowed normal protocol of the nurse assessing him within 7 days\nof admission. Assistant Superintendent reported she spoke with\nYouth A the morning of 1/11/23 and he stated his wrist felt\ndifferent and asked to see the nurse. During the conversation,\nYouth A never alleged his wrist injury or wrist hurting was a result\nof the restraint from 1/10/23. The nurse was supposed to see\nYouth A on 1/9/23 or 1/10/23, prior to the restraint, however Youth\nA was yelling in his room, so the nurse saw him on 1/11/23. CA\nreported if staff cannot comply with CPI restraint methods, the\nexpectation is to be reasonable in efforts to protect staff and\nyouth, which includes holding onto a youth until help arrives.\nYouth A was interviewed via video conference on 1/17/23.\nYouth A reported he did not know how his wrist got injured and it\nnever hurt prior to arriving at the facility. He stated he was\nadmitted to the facility on 12/29/22 and it started hurting about 2\nweeks after he got to the facility. Youth A reported he put in a\nrequest to see the nurse when he saw a cyst returned. He showed\nthere was a cyst on his left wrist (very top of wrist/bottom of his\nhand) and reported cysts have been an ongoing issue for him in\nthat spot. He reported he had the first cyst about 2 years ago,\nwent to Urgent Care and it went away after the doctor gave him a\nwrist brace. He reported he had an X-Ray completed last week,\nwhich showed he had a wrist fracture. The doctor did not share a\n2",
    "timeframe for when the fracture occurred. Youth A denied any\nother events, fights or impacts to his wrist that could result in a\nfracture. He reported during the restraint on 1/11/23, Supervisor\ngrabbed Youth A around his waist and pulled him to the ground\nbecause Youth A was trying to fight with Youth B. Youth A\nreported he had his eyes closed and does not know who else\nrestrained him. Youth A stated he was laying with his stomach\ntowards the ground. Youth A reported Supervisor’s forearm was\non the back of his neck, he stated he couldn’t breathe, and\nSupervisor moved his arm to Youth A’s head instead. Youth A\nstated his left arm was not grabbed during the restraint, but it was\npositioned under Supervisor’s body and/or leg during the restraint.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face on-site at the facility on\n1/19/23 in conjunction with the MDHHS Worker and Law\nEnforcement. Youth B stated Youth A became escalated during a\nGroup Assistance Meeting and attempted to start a physical\naltercation with him. Youth B reported Youth A shoved Staff 5 into\na door, she fell to the ground, and other staff responded quickly.\nYouth B stated Supervisor was the first person in the room and\ngrabbed Youth A from behind to stop him from attacking anyone.\nHe reported he did not see anything else because he went to his\nroom when the other staff came in.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face on-site at the facility on\n1/19/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law\nEnforcement. Staff 1 reported she was the last staff member to\nenter the pod. When she entered, Youth A was laying with his\nback on the floor and Supervisor was holding him down by his\nchest area. She stated she could not tell which part of\nSupervisor’s body was on Youth A’s chest, but no part of\nSupervisor’s body was on Youth A’s wrist. She stated she helped\nsecure the room, and when she was done, Staff 2 and Staff 3\nwere helping Youth A to his feet as he had calmed down.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face on-site at the facility on\n1/19/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law\nEnforcement. Staff 2 reported Youth A was laying with his back\non the floor and Supervisor was holding Youth A down by his\nchest area. Staff 2 noted specifically Supervisor’s forearms were\non Youth A’s chest. Staff 2 stated while Supervisor was holding\nYouth A down, Youth A was kicking, yelling, and screaming and\nSupervisor was attempting to verbally de-escalate Youth A and\nwas asking Youth A to stop. Youth A threatened to bite\nSupervisor. At one point, Youth A stated he could not breathe\ntwice, and Staff 2 stated Supervisor adjusted his position\n3",
    "immediately. Staff 2 reported Youth A’s hands were wrapped\naround Supervisor’s thigh, so Staff 2 loosened Youth A’s grip and\nsecured Youth A’s right arm while Staff 3 secured Youth A’s left\narm. Staff 4 and Staff 5 secured each of Youth A’s legs.\nSupervisor was then able to get up and step away. Staff 2\nreported Staff 3 lightly patted Youth A’s chest and repeatedly\ninstructed Youth A to breathe to help Youth A calm down. After\nYouth A was calm, Staff 2 and Staff 3 helped Youth A to his feet,\neach held one of his hands and guided him into his room. Staff 2\nstated Youth A did not verbally disclose or physically demonstrate\nany type of pain associated with his wrist during or directly after\nthe restraint. Staff 2 reported he did not see anything Supervisor\ndid that could have caused injury to Youth A’s wrist because\nYouth A’s arms were wrapped around Supervisor’s leg. Staff 2\nstated Youth A never complained about any pain or medical\nissues during any of his conversations with Youth A prior to or\nafter the restraint.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face on-site at the facility on\n1/19/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law\nEnforcement. Staff 3’s interview was consistent with Staff 2’s\ninterview. Staff 3 added he had good rapport with Youth A and\nspoke to him often. Staff 3 noted Youth A never complained about\nany pain or medical issues during any of their conversations. After\nYouth A received his brace for the diagnosed wrist fracture, Staff 3\nasked Youth A what happened, and Youth A stated he was not\nsure how he got injured. Staff 3 reported the first initial response\nfor circumstances involving youth fighting is to provide safety and\nsecurity to the youth/staff and then staff are to defend themselves\nuntil other staff can arrive.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face on-site at the facility on\n1/19/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law\nEnforcement. Staff 4 reported when she entered the room and\nSupervisor was on top of Youth A but could not remember\nSupervisor’s position. Staff 4 reported she helped secure one of\nYouth A’s legs while Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 5 secured Youth A’s\nother leg and arms. Staff 4 did not see anything during the\nrestraint or incident that could have caused injury to Youth A’s\nwrist. Staff 4 stated Youth A never said “ow” during the restraint or\ncomplained to her about any injuries he had prior, during or after\nthe restraint. Staff 4 reported the only consensus she received\nfrom debriefing with other staff was Supervisor should have waited\nfor additional assistance from other staff prior to restraining Youth\nA, especially because Supervisor was so much bigger than Youth\nA.\n4",
    "Staff 5 was interviewed face to face on-site at the facility on\n1/19/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law\nEnforcement. Staff 5 reported she was conducting the Group\nAssistance Meeting for Youth A prior to the incident occurring.\nStaff 5 stated Youth A became upset after Youth B called him out\nfor his behavior of punching things and folding his hands in an\nangry way. Staff 5 reported when Youth A began to approach\nYouth B in an aggressive manor, she stepped in between them\nand put her arms up to block Youth A from becoming physical with\nYouth B. Staff 5 reported Youth A pushed her into the door in the\nroom and she fell. While she was getting up, she saw Supervisor\ncome into the room and secure Youth A from behind. Staff 5\nreported she secured the other youth in their rooms and then\ncame to help restrain one of Youth A’s legs. Staff 5 reported she\ndid not see any actions during the incident that would have\nresulted in injury to Youth A’s wrist. Staff 5 stated Youth A\npreviously complained to her about pain in his wrist, but stated he\ngot in a fight with someone before being admitted to the facility so\nhe guessed that might be the reason. Staff 5 stated Youth A\nnormally complained about his wrist hurting after playing\nbasketball or other activities in the gym. After Youth A was\ndiagnosed with a fractured wrist, he was restricted from activities\nbecause of the wrist brace he was wearing. When Staff 5 asked\nYouth A about his wrist, Youth A told Staff 5 his wrist was broken\nand told her he wasn’t sure if it was broken due to the restraint or\nfrom the fight he participated in prior to entering the facility. Staff 5\nreported a debrief was held with staff and Supervisor after the\nrestraint and they all spoke about concerns regarding Youth A\ncomplaining he couldn’t breathe as well as the need to wait until\nmore staff arrive prior to putting a youth in a restraint.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/19/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law\nEnforcement. Supervisor reported when he entered the room,\nYouth A was running around the table to attack Youth B, so\nSupervisor bearhugged Youth A from behind. Supervisor noted a\nbearhug is not ideal because the goal is to try to prevent injuries.\nHe noted it is not an approved CPI restraint method and is not\ntaught in CPI. Supervisor stated after he bearhugged him, he and\nYouth A accidently fell to the ground. Supervisor reported once\nthey were on the ground, he attempted to get back up, but he was\nunable to because Youth A wrapped his arms around Supervisor’s\nleft leg. Supervisor leaned on his right side trying to hold Youth A\ndown. Supervisor reported Youth A was trying to bite him, so he\nwas pushing Youth A’s head away so he could not bite. When\n5",
    "Youth A stated he couldn’t breathe, Supervisor adjusted his\nposition and Youth A had no further complaints. Supervisor\nreported he was finally able to get up once four other staff had\nindividually secured Youth A’s arms and legs. Supervisor reported\nhe checked on Youth A later in the shift. Youth A did not have any\nvisible injuries and did not complain of any injuries or concerns at\nthat time. While Youth A was in the facility, Youth A complained of\ndifferent ailments, but never mentioned any urgent concerns or\ncomplaints about his wrist.\nNurse was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/19/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker and Law Enforcement.\nNurse completed the initial physical intake with Youth A on 1/3/23\nand he had a benign ganglion cyst on his upper wrist/lower hand.\nHe reported it was bothersome to him because it was annoying\nand unsightly, but he did not complain of any pain. He had full\nrange of motion and was not prescribed any medication or\ntreatment on 1/3/23. On 1/11/23, Nurse received a request to see\nYouth A because he reported his wrist hurt bad and he couldn’t\nmove it without it hurting. Nurse saw him on 1/11/23 and he\ncomplained the cyst on his wrist was the cause of the pain. Youth\nA told Nurse he was restrained on 1/10/23 and said his wrist hurt\nmore after last night, but never stated the pain was a result of the\nrestraint. Nurse reiterated Youth A specifically stated his wrist\n“hurt more” after last night, not that it began hurting after last night.\nDue to his pain, he was seen by Physician Assistant on 1/12/23,\nand the Physician Assistant ordered X-Rays. Nurse reported X-\nRays were completed on 1/13/23 and they received the results the\nsame day. The X-Rays showed Youth A had a small fracture in\nthe distant ulna with associated soft tissue swelling, but no\ndisplacement. As a result of the X-Rays, the doctor ordered a wrist\nsplint for 2 weeks and wanted to follow up in one week, but Youth\nA left the facility prior to the one week follow up appointment\noccurring. The radiologist did not note the length of time since the\nfracture occurred.\nPhysician Assistant (PA) was interviewed via phone on\n1/30/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. PA saw Youth A\non 1/12/23 and diagnosed him with a ganglion cyst on his left\nwrist. PA noted Youth A had good sensation of his fingers, good\ngrip strength, no significant swelling, and a full range of motion.\nPA prescribed Ibuprofen for 5 days and ordered an X-Ray to\nassess the cyst further as she thought it might be a bone cyst.\nYouth A asked for a splint because his wrist hurt, but PA assessed\na splint was not medically necessary.\n6",
    "VIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage regarding the restraint from 1/10/23 involving Youth\nA was reviewed multiple times on 1/19/23. The video footage was\nconsistent with Supervisor and all Staff interviews showing\nSupervisor bear hug Youth A, and Supervisor and Youth A fall to\nthe ground. The camera angle prevented the ability to see how\nSupervisor was holding Youth A. Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4 and Staff\n5 then all secure one of Youth A’s limbs and Supervisor got up\nand moved away.\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n• MDHHS Worker’s interview with Doctor from 1/30/23.\nDoctor reported he reviewed Youth A’s radiology report, but\nnever saw or spoke with Youth A. Doctor reported the age\nof a fracture cannot be precisely determined from an X-\nRay, but there may be indicators of visible healing if the\nfracture is more than 2-3 weeks old. Doctor reported the\nRadiologist is the only one who could provide further\ninformation if those healing indicators were present.\n• Incident Reports dated 1/10/23 completed by Supervisor,\nStaff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, Youth A, Youth B\nand Youth C. Staff and Supervisor incident reports were\nconsistent with their interviews. In Youth A’s incident report,\nhe noted he was punching things on the way back from the\ngym.\n• Facility Management Policy: Fights, Disturbances and Use\nof Force and/or Restraints (Rev. 12/21/22) states Detention\nstaff may use physical force to prevent imminent injury to a\nyouth or to another person.\n• Facility Training and Staff Development Policy (Rev.\n12/22/22) states Youth Specialists, Professional\nSpecialists, Shift Supervisors & Administrators are required\nto complete a “Use of Force” training on a yearly basis.\n• Supervisor completed CPI Refresher Training on 5/12/22.\nSupervisor does not have any disciplinary records in his\nemployee file.\n• Youth A’s health history summary from the facility notes no\ninjuries or pain associated with his wrist.\n• Youth A’s medical record confirms his appointment\nschedule as stated by Nurse. Youth A’s medical request\n7",
    "form he filled out on 1/11/23 states his wrist “started hurting\nmore after last night”. On 1/12/23, Youth A complained the\ncyst on his left wrist was causing him more pain and denied\nany other recent trauma to his wrist.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to support the restraint conducted caused\nYouth A’s fractured wrist. Youth A complained about pain from his\nwrist prior to the restraint occurring. In addition, there was no\nevidence from the video or interviews completed which\ndemonstrated anyone’s actions during the incident would have\ncaused his wrist to be injured.\nHowever, based upon staff interviews as well as video reviewed,\nSupervisor completed an improper restraint on Youth A, which is\nagainst the facility’s written policies.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nFebruary 21, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 23, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
