EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod:\nThe first incident related to an allegation that the foster child was hit on the butt by\nthe foster mother after the foster child called her sibling an idiot and the “B” word.\nDuring the investigation the foster parent admitted to hitting the child, though she did\nnot recall the circumstances. The foster home was found in violation of the behavior\nmanagement rule. A corrective action plan was developed with the foster parent that\nincluded: De-escalation techniques for working with children who display physically\naggressive behaviors; and positive discipline for toddlers. The agency adhered to all\nlicensing requirements and timeframes related to this special evaluation.\nThe second incident related to allegations that the foster parent whooped the child\nwith a belt when he is bad.

The agency adhered to all licensing requirements and\ntimeframes related to this special evaluation.",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan during this\nlicensing period. The corrective action plan related to its 2024 Interim inspection\nwhere it received 16 rule violations; 2 of which were repeat violations. During this\n2025 Renewal inspection the agency received 22 rule violations. Six of the 22\nviolations are repeat violations. Four of the 6 repeat violations are from 2024. Of\nthese 4 repeat violations from 2024, the number of individual cases cited remained\nthe same for one of them. For the other 3 repeat violations, the number of\nindividual cases cited increased: R400.212(3)(a) related to personnel record, the\nnumber of individual cases cited when from 1 of 16 to 7 of 15. R400.418(1)(5)\nrelated to Development of service plans, the number of individual cases cited\nwhen from 3 of 8 to 7 of 8. R400.12509(3)(o) the number of individual cases cited\nwhen from 1 of 3 to 2 of 3.\nThe agency contributed to its increase in rule violations and increase in the\nnumber of individual cases cited to its staff turnover and poor documentation\nwhich the agency reported it is working to improve. Notwithstanding the rule\nviolation increases, and agency changes, the agency implemented all action steps\nwithin its 2024 Interim inspection CAP. Amongst the agency’s goals moving\nforward are to bringing greater rule compliance and stabilizing its staff.\nIt is also worth noting that the agency terminated its adoption contract with the\ndepartment in September 2025.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 10/15/2025 which\ndenoted violations identified in its 2024 Interim inspection. The chief administrator\nreported hiring and training of new staff has continued to be a barrier to timely task\ncompletions; and that new staff expressed not feeling they are equipped to\nindependently do the job following the department’s child welfare institute training.\nAdditionally, the agency reported staff have missed some key performance\nindicators (KPI) due to staffing issues; but it experienced a slight uptick in various\nareas in the recent reporting period due to greater supervisory oversight and\nfollow-up. Based on concerns related to compliance, the agency has instituted\nmandatory monthly CAP compliance meetings; and the chief administrator\nreported supervisory monitoring, and documentation is being changed to better\nillustrate discussions. As for areas of strength, the agency indicated, it requires\ncase contacts to be entered into MISACWIS within the first 2 weeks of the month.\nThis has resulted in improved compliance, specifically with sibling visits, in that the\nagency averaged 90% compliance throughout this report period. The agency also\nreported utilizing outlooks to send CAP compliance reminders to supervisors\nwhich helped with accountability of their assigned data. The agency reported\nmoving forward all efforts will be put forth to improve its compliances across all\nareas.",
    "Financial Overview\nThe agency submitted a 2025 annual budget and 9/30/2025 independent financial\naudit, which upon review did not show any discernable financial concerns.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to my discussion with the chief administrator, Licensing\nDirector/Supervisor and foster care supervisor, during the entrance conference, I\ninterviewed two foster care workers, a licensing worker and one supervisor. The\nstaff interviewed reported feeling supported by their supervisor, and the owner of\nthe agency, as well as co-workers. They reported strengths for the agency such\nas good communications, the chief administrator’s support and supervision;\nteamwork; and the agency’s efforts to hire good staff. Area for improvement were\nindicated as need for staff retention, better grooming of staff to effectively do their\njobs, hiring a program manager, more training for staff, hands on assistance\nrelated to how to do a task, the agency gaining greater realization and attention to\nthe fact that staff stress and burn out effects staff productivity, staff consistency,\nand an increase in salaries and benefits.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nDuring my walk through at the agency's facility no safety concerns were observed.\nThe agency appears to have sufficient space and equipment for its employees;\nand case records were securely stored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nOctober 27, 2025\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 28, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
