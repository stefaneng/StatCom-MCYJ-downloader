    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that on 9/1/24, Youth A was choked by an unidentified\nstaff member.\nInvestigation I left a voicemail to Complainant on 9/4/24. I have not received a\nreturn call.\nI spoke to Administrator on 9/4/24. Allegations were discussed\nand no new information was provided.\nYouth A was interviewed on 9/12/24 at the facility. Youth A\nreported he was pulled down on the floor by an unknown staff\nmember and was choked by Staff 3. Youth A reported Staff 3 had\nhis forearm on his neck while he was on the floor. Youth A\nreported he doesn’t remember being restrained and doesn’t\nremember what his behaviors were. Youth A would not provide\nany more details.\nStaff 1 reported on 9/1/24, Youth A had turned around his day\nand was doing well. Because of this, they allowed him to play\nvideo games. Staff 1 reported Youth A does not do well\ntransitioning from this activity. In order to be proactive, Staff 1\nmade sure he was aware of the time frame he could play and\ngave him time updates so that Youth A would know when his time\nwould be up. Once Youth A’s time was up, he escalated and\nstarted throwing items around. The other youth in the room\nbecame upset so they had redirected Youth A out into the hallway.\nYouth A went into the hallway and then attempted to walk outside.\nHe then went back inside into his bedroom. Staff 2 was in the\nbedroom, removing items that would cause him to be distracted.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A grabbed Staff 2’s long hair and pulled her\nto the ground. Both Staff 2 and Youth A were on the ground. Staff\n2",
    "1 reported he along with Staff 3, pried open his fingers so Staff 2\ncould get free. Once they did this, they were already on the floor,\nso they (Staff 1 and Staff 3) engaged in the supine control\nposition. Staff 2 removed herself from the bedroom. Staff 1\nreported they maintained this hold until Youth A was safe again.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was crying and coughing afterwards and\ndid say he was “throwing up blood.” Staff 1 reported Youth A was\nnot throwing up blood but spitting. Staff 1 reported Youth A was\nnot harmed, was not chocked, nor had any injuries. Staff 1\nreported since it was bedtime, Youth A went to bed after his\nbehavior was discussed.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A was playing video games in the common\narea before bedtime. Staff 2 reported Youth A was reminded\nthroughout his playing how much time he had left with the\nvideogame. When it was time to give back the game, Youth A did\nnot want to and became upset. Youth A went into the hallway and\nthen went outside. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 went outside after\nYouth A and she went into his bedroom to remove possible safety\nitems. Youth A then came into the room and pulled her hair and\nbrought both of them to the floor. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 and Staff\n3 came in and loosened her hair from Youth A’s hands. Staff 2\nwas not sure how they did this due to her lack of ability to see, but\nreported after she was released, she left the room because she\nknew she was upset. When Staff 2 came back into the room, the\nrestraint was over, and Youth A was being debriefed. Staff 2\nreported Youth A was sitting on his bed and Staff 1 and Staff 3\nwere debriefing him. Youth A never reported he was hurt and did\nnot state anyone had choked him.\nStaff 3 reported he was called to assist with a situation with Youth\nA. Youth A was upset and was pacing in the lobby and then went\noutside. Youth A came back inside and into his bedroom. As Staff\n3 was turning off the exit alarm, he heard screaming. Staff 3\nreported he went into the bedroom and Youth A had both his\nhands pulling and grabbing Staff 2’s hair. Staff 3 reported he and\nStaff 1 pried Youth A’s fingers from Staff 2’s hair. Once released\nfrom Youth A’s hold, Staff 2 left the room. Both Staff 2 and Youth\nA were already on the ground due to Youth A pulling her hair,\ncausing her to go to the ground so Staff 3 reported they placed\nhim in a supine control; lasting seven minutes. Staff 3 reported it\nwas a textbook supine due to them already on the ground. Staff 3\nreported no one choked Youth A and Youth A did not spit up\nblood. Youth A never complained about being hurt after the\nrestraint. Staff 3 reported he was not spitting up blood.\n3",
    "Video Reviewed:\nVideo was observed from 7:48pm-8:10pm on 9/1/24. The hallway\nand lobby area are the only visible areas. The restraint occurred in\nthe bedroom. The interviews of Staff 1, Staff, 2, and Staff 3 are all\nconsistent with the video footage in the lobby and hallway.\nDocuments:\n• Personnel files: all staff were up to date on training and\nclearances. None of the Staff had disciplinary action.\n• Incident report dated 9/1/24 is consistent with staff\ninterviews. Youth A was not injured nor needed follow up\nmedical.\n• The Behavior Management Policy which includes the CPI\nmanual was reviewed. The agency followed their CPI\nmanual, which shows the appropriate techniques, including\nrestraint, to deescalate a youth in outburst.\n• The Behavior Management Policy was reviewed. The\npolicy confirms that physical punishment is not a tool for\nde-escalation.\nAnalysis The agency is complaint with this rule. Staff completed a CPI\nSupine restraint. There is no evidence to validate the allegations.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/8/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
