One youth went AWOL on 11/03/22 and the facility did not know\nuntil the following day. Youth is placed at the facility for issues with\nrunning away and the expectation is that he would be supervised.\nYouth outside of the facility are leaving vapes on the facility premises\nfor youth at the facility.\nInvestigation Administrator 1 was interviewed over the phone on 11/16/2022. She\nwas informed of this new investigation. Administrator 1 provided\ninformation on staffing and as well as procedures for third shift work at\nthe facility and documentation related to the incident. She stated that\nthere was only one youth currently placed at the facility. It was\ndiscussed that the incident in question revolved around a “dummy” that\nYouth A had formed with pillows and blankets under his comforter in an\nattempt to distract staff from his running away from the facility.\n2",
    "Administrator 1 described the third shift policies and training that the\nfacility uses and stated that they have not required staff to see anything\nspecific for a youth that appears to be covered completely by their\nbedding while sleeping.\nStaff 1 was interviewed during an unannounced face-to-face visit on\n11/16/2022. She stated that she was the first shift staff who discovered\nthat Youth A had left the facility sometime overnight on the night of the\nincident. She stated that her shift started before the youth wake up at\nabout 8:30 AM. She stated that she went in to wake Youth A up and\nwas surprised because Youth A was usually awake by the time, she\nentered the room. She stated that she poked her head in the room and\nsaid something to the effect of “Hey, time to get up” and did not get a\nresponse for about five minutes. Staff 1 recalled getting her coworker\nStaff 2 in order for them to both go in the room together. Staff 1 stated\nthat when she went in the room and pulled the blankets back, she\ndiscovered that Youth A was not in the bed. At this point Staff 1 stated\nthat she and Staff 2 walked through the rest of the house and\nimmediately went through their communication tree to alert appropriate\npeople that Youth A had a AWOL’ed, including calling Administrator 1\nand Probation Officer 1 as well as Central dispatch. Staff 1 described\nthe alarm system that the facility utilizes. She stated that all the\nwindows are alarmed as well as doors to the bedrooms for the youth.\nStaff 1 opened several windows and doors in order to provide examples\nof the chime that can be heard throughout the house. Staff 1\nhypothesized that Youth A timed the alarm of opening his window with\nanother door opening, or a shift change in order to sneak away and not\nbe noticed. Staff 1 showed the specific bedroom in which Youth A was\nplaced prior to his leaving, which is downstairs. The bedroom window\nprovides adequate egress and is level with the ground outside. Staff 1\nconfirmed that the windows are not locked in this facility.\nIn regards to allegations of youth that were sneaking out of their\nwindows onto the roof, Staff 1 stated that she had heard the current\nyouth placed stating that he has done this before, but believed he said\nthis in a joking manner. Staff 1 stated that when she heard Youth B\njoking about this, she made sure to tell him that this was not\nappropriate and that it should not be spoken about lightly.\nStaff 1 stated that she has not heard of any allegations or concerns\nabout Vape pens being hidden on the grounds of the facility for youth to\nget into their possession. She referred to an incident a few weeks prior\nwhen two youths believed they saw someone outside one evening, but\nstaff quickly went outside and did not see anyone near the house or in\nthe adjacent woods next to it.\n4",
    "Youth B was interviewed on 11/16/2022 during an unannounced face-\nto-face visit at the facility. He stated that he did not know what was\ngoing on with Youth A until the morning that it was discovered Youth A\nhad left the facility. He stated Youth A said to him the prior day that he\nwas thinking about running away, but he did not believe staff overheard\nthis nor did he really believe Youth A himself. Youth B stated that he\ndoes not know how Youth A would have run away because he feels\nthat third shift staff are pretty active during the night. Youth B stated this\nbecause he said he frequently gets woken up by staff moving around\nthe house and briefly coming into the rooms to do their nightly checks.\nHe stated that he can hear the alarm throughout the house. Youth B\nwas asked about allegations that youth were climbing out of the\nwindows and getting out to the roof at night and he stated that he was\nonly joking about that the other day and he had heard another youth\nstate that in a previous time placed at the facility approximately a year\nago. Youth B denied ever climbing out of his window to get onto the\nroof at night. Youth B also stated that he has never seen or been\nconcerned about individuals leaving vape pens outside the home for\nyouth to get, but stated that he heard another previously placed youth\ntalking about that happening back in 2010.\nYouth A's mother/Complainant was interviewed over the phone on\n1/09/2022. She reported that her son is now out of state, but she had\ncontact with him in the days after he was found after his AWOL from\nthe facility. She stated that he told her he had gone to bed for the night\nand attempted to time his window opening by hearing another door\nopen within the house. Youth A's mother stated that he did not offer\nany more details than that. She also stated that he had reported to her\nthat other youth were going out onto the roof at night, as well as\nprocuring vapes from outside sources at the facility. Youth A's mother\nstated that she did not bring up these concerns with the facility after\nhearing them because she thought they may have been untrue and did\nnot know how to bring them up.\nProbation Officer 1 was interviewed on 01/09/2022 over the phone.\nShe stated that she still works with Youth A and that he is in a\nresidential program in Arizona. Probation Officer 1 stated that she knew\nabout the allegations that Youth A attempted to time his window\nopening with another door in the facility in order to run away. She\nstated that she had immediate communication with the facility after they\ndiscovered Youth A was gone the next morning. Probation Officer 1\nstated that she recalled hearing Staff 1 state that Youth A had said he\nwas going to bed early the night prior, and that Staff 3 admitted to not\nactually seeing Youth A’s face when doing the nightly bed checks.\nProbation Officer 1 stated that she has worked with the facility\nnumerous times and has one other youth run away, but she did not\n4",
    "have any concerns about how that incident transpired. Probation Officer\n1 stated that she had never heard allegations about the vaping or youth\nclimbing onto the roof as well. Probation Officer 1 reiterated that she\nhad very good communication with the facility prior to and after Youth\nA‘s run away and did not have any concerns with using them again.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone on 01/09/2023. She confirmed\nthat she was the third shift staff responsible for the night in question.\nStaff 3 stated this felt like a very normal night with only a couple youths\nplaced in the facility. She stated that her training has always been to\nopen the door of a bedroom, or peek inside if the door is already slightly\nopen, and look to see if youth are in their beds. Staff 3 stated that it has\nnever been asked of her to make sure that she sees a body part or a\nface of a youth while doing this check. Staff 3 recalled seeing what she\nbelieved to be Youth A sleeping as curious because he did not move\nover the course of the night, but she did not act on that any further as\nper the facilities training for third shift. Per the facility’s Policies and\nprocedures handbook dated 03/15/2022 “The bedroom checks section\nwill start as soon as the youth go into their rooms. These are done\nsporadically in 15-minute intervals. Bedroom checks section does not\ncorrespond to a singular room, instead it is a continuation of the many\nroom checks done per night.” Staff 3 stated that the hallway light near\nthe downstairs bedroom stays on all night and provides enough light to\nsee well enough into the bedroom, so no flashlights are needed. She\nstated that she has oftentimes accidentally woken up youth as she\nopens doors to look inside their rooms. Staff 3 stated that there was not\nany chance that Youth A was able to get onto the roof of the facility\nbecause he was in one of the downstairs bedrooms. Staff 3 also\ndenied any knowledge about the allegations that someone was leaving\nvape pens around the grounds for youth to have without staff's\nknowledge. Staff 3 stated that her normal routine during third shift is\nthat she sits in the living room near the stairs to the downstairs\nbedrooms as well as upstairs bedrooms. She stated that she sits in a\nchair angled specifically so that she can hear and see as much as\npossible. Staff 3 stated that she sometimes has the television on but\nkeeps the volume at two in order for it to be as quiet as possible. Staff 3\nalso stated that she checks the facility's alarm system at the beginning\nof each shift. She stated that in her 10 years of working third shift at the\nfacility, she has seen the alarm system malfunction only once or twice.\nBoth of those instances involved alarms going off that did not need to\nbe going off as opposed to alarms not going off when they should. Staff\n3 did not believe that there was a chance that the alarm did not go off\nwhen Youth A ran away, but that he was likely smart enough to time it\nwell so that it was unnoticed.\nDocuments that were reviewed over the course of this investigation:\n4",
    "- Facility Policies and Procedures. The section describing “Midnight\nduties” states the following: “The bedroom checks section will start\nas soon as the youth go into their rooms. These are done\nsporadically in 15-minute intervals. Bedroom checks section does\nnot correspond to a singular room, instead it is a continuation of the\nmany room checks done per night.”\n- Security cameras. The facility’s security system has cameras\npointing at the front entry room, living room, classroom, kitchen and\nthe hallways to the bedrooms. There are no cameras that capture\nanything inside the bedrooms or the exterior where Youth A would\nhave exited the building.\n- Picture of the bedroom of Youth A was provided showing pillows\nand blankets formed under the comforter to simulate someone\nsleeping in the bed.\n- Case file for Youth A. Youth A did not have a history of AWOL\nconcerns prior to placement in this facility.\n- Midnight shift duties documentation from the night of 11/03/2022\nwhen Youth A ran away from the facility. Requirements from CCI\nRule 400.4127 (4) were met with checks made within 15 minutes of\neach other for youth’s bedrooms.\nAnalysis From interviews with staff, youth and other individuals responsible to\nYouth A as well as documentation reviewed, it is found that a violation\nof CCI Rule 400.4127 (4) occurred because staff was not able to have\n“eyes on” checks of Youth A after he had formed a “dummy” under his\ncomforter and ran away from the facility.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy.\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the that\nthe current license status be continued.\n01/17/2023\n_____________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 20, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
