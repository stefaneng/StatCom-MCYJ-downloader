The efforts\nshall be documented in the child’s record.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There is concern for the manner in which facility is managing a foster\ncare youth's placement.\nInvestigation Relative A, who is also the complainant, filed a written complaint\nalleging that he has concerns with Relatives B & C, with whom Youth A\nis placed. His concerns include isolating Youth A from his family and\nsiblings, being recovering addicts with the potential of relapse, and\nhaving a son who is mistreating Youth A and making statements that he\ndoes not want Youth A living there. Additionally, Relative A alleged that\n4",
    "the foster care agency workers have ignored his concerns and are not\nplacing with him due to the fact that he identifies as LGBTQ.\nINTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Relative A - On 1/13/2023 a voicemail message was left\nfor Relative A. Follow-up emails were sent on 1/18/2023 and 1/25/2023.\nRelative A responded on 1/25/2023 and was interviewed by phone on\n1/26/2023. Relative A reported when Youth A was initially placed in\nfoster care, he was already living with Relative A’s father and sister.\nYouth A remained in that home placed in the care of Relative A’s sister\nand brother-in-law, Relatives E & F. Relative A reported that he\nsupported that placement, and everything was going well until Youth A\nwas removed from that home in July of 2021. Youth A was then placed\nwith Relative A’s brother and sister-in-law, Relatives B & C. Relative A\nstated that he was in support of that placement at the time. He reported\nthat he felt he should also be studied for placement as a back-up plan\nand told this to Relatives B & C, but they would not tell him what\nagency they were working with, so he didn’t know who to contact. He\nreported that his relationship with Relatives B & C has since\ndeteriorated. He reported that he sent an email to an MDHHS worker\napproximately a year ago expressing concerns with Relatives B & C\nafter which he was contacted by a worker from Catholic Charities. He\nstated that the worker discussed his concerns with him and also asked\nhim if he was interested in being studied for placement. Relative A\nstated that he expressed interest after which he was studied and\napproved for placement; however, he reported that he was told there\nwas no reason to move Youth A from his current placement. He\nreported that he has applied to adopt Youth A as a competing party and\nis awaiting a decision from the Michigan Children’s Institute.\nRelative A reported that one of Youth A’s siblings, Sibling 1 lives with\nRelative A. He stated that Sibling 1 doesn’t get to visit with Youth A as\nmuch as he used to but did visit him on New Year's. He reported that\nYouth A also has another sibling, Sibling 2, who is living with Relative\nA’s dad and does visit with Youth A. Relative A stated that there is a\nthird sibling who lives with that sibling’s mother and does visit with\nYouth A. Relative A stated that he feels Relatives B & C are isolating\nYouth A from his family because they limit his visits with Sibling 1 and\nhave told Relative A that Youth A doesn’t want to visit with him, which\nRelative A believes Relatives B & C told him to say.\nIn regard to mistreating of Youth A by Relative B & C’s biological son,\nRelative A reported that, approximately a year ago, he heard Relative B\n& C’s biological son say something to Youth A about wishing Youth A\n4",
    "had his own mom and dad. Relative A did address this with Relative B\nwho in turn punished her son, which Relative A didn’t think was\nappropriate as it was a teaching moment. Relative A did raise this\nconcern approximately a year ago and agency staff spoke to him, but\nhe does not know if it was addressed with Relatives B & C by the\nagency. He stated that he does not know if Relative B & C’s son still\nmistreats Youth A.\nRelative A stated that he doesn’t feel the agency workers take concerns\nhe brings to them seriously and minimize and disregard what he says\ndue to him identifying as LGBTQ. This feeling is due to the worker who\ncame to his home providing him with paperwork that said the agency\nwill not place children in LGBTQ homes. He stated that the worker\nemphasized that he read that specific document.\nProgram Manager 1 - On 1/19/2023 Program Manager 1 (PM1) was\ninterviewed in person at the agency. PM1 reported that Youth A was\nalready placed with Relatives E & F when the agency accepted case\nresponsibility. Failure to report domestic violence concerns arose with\nRelatives E & F as well as concerns with the family not following a\nsafety plan regarding marijuana storage in the home, resulting in a\nneed for a placement change. Relatives B & C expressed interest in\nplacement of Youth A and were subsequently studied and approved for\nplacement. At that time, Relative A was living with Youth A’s mother\nand had a good relationship with Relatives B & C and supported the\nplacement. Relative B does have substance abuse history; however, he\nparticipated in treatment and the agency has had no concerns with his\nrecovery. Due to Relative B’s recovery, he and Relative C have limited\ncontact with family members they have determined to be unhealthy for\nthem. PM1 reported that there have been several meetings with\nRelatives B & C and the assigned agency foster care staff and\nsupervision to discuss their relationship with other family members and\nto encourage them to maintain contact between Youth A and his\nrelatives. PM1 reported that Relatives B & C continue to facilitate visits\nbetween Youth A and his half-siblings.\nProgram Manager 2 - On 1/19/2023 Program Manager 2 (PM2) was\ninterviewed in person at the agency. PM2 reported that, at the time\nYouth A was placed with Relatives B & C, Relative A had a positive and\ncommunicative relationship with Relatives B & C and no concerns were\npresented by Relative A. Since that time, there has been a breakdown\nin family relationships and Relative A now has a contentious\nrelationship with Relatives B & C. She reported that Relative A was\nassessed for placement of Youth A when Relative A requested to be\n4",
    "considered for adoption after Youth A’s parents’ rights were terminated.\nRelative A was approved for placement, but there was no reason to\nmove Youth A from the relatives with whom he was already placed.\nAdoption Worker - On 1/19/2023 Adoption Worker (AW) was\ninterviewed in person at the agency. AW reported that she has\nparticipated in several meeting with Relatives B & C about their\nrelationship with family members. Relative C does not want contact with\nYouth A’s grandmother due to the chaotic and unhealthy nature of their\nrelationship but has maintained contact with Youth A’s half-siblings. AW\nreported that Youth A was also having visits with Relative A until last\nsummer, when Youth A began stating he did not want to visit with\nRelative A. AW spoke to Youth A about his not wanting to visit and\nYouth A replied that he likes Relative A, but he would rather just stay\nhome with Relatives B & C than participate in visits.\nAW reported that she completed an assessment of Relative A after he\nrequested to be considered for the placement and adoption of Youth A\nin February of 2022. She reported that Relative A was approved for\nplacement, but he was not recommended for adoption of Youth A due\nto Youth A’s time placed with Relative’s B & C and Youth A’s expressed\ndesire to be adopted by them.

FCW reported that in February of\n2022 she began supervising monthly 1-hour visits between Youth A\nand Relative A. She reported that in June of 2022, Relative A brought\npresents for Youth A’s birthday. One of the presents was a necklace\nwith Youth A’s birth father’s picture and date of death which included a\nnote from Youth A’s mother. After that visit, FCW had a conversation\nwith Relative A about the inappropriateness of the gift and told him that\nall items brought for Youth A would now have to be approved by the\nagency before giving them to Youth A. After that visit, FCW has\ncontinued to ask Youth A about scheduling a visit with Relative A every\n4",
    "month, but Youth A has consistently said he does not want to visit with\nRelative A, stating he would rather stay home with Relatives B & C.\nFCW reported that she has never observed any concerns with the\ninteractions between Youth A and his cousin. She reported that she has\nobserved them playing on several occasions and the only negative\ninteractions she has witnessed are age-appropriate sibling rivalry type\nof interactions.\nFoster Care Supervisor - On 1/19/2023 Foster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nwas interviewed in person at the agency.
