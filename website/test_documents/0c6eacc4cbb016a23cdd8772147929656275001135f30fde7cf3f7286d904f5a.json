    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted into allegations made by a former youth at Vista Maria from 2007-2008, covering misdiagnosis, improper seclusion and medication, dangerous restraints, inadequate medical follow-up for self-harm, staff instigating fights, improper background checks, and dismissal of sexual misconduct. The investigation found no established violations for any allegation due to insufficient records and inability to interview key parties, concluding the facility is in compliance. However, the inability to substantiate the serious claims stems primarily from record destruction and witness unavailability, not from a definitive finding of proper past conduct.",
