Worker 1 also stated\nshe stabbed someone when she was a child.\nComplainant Interview: A phone call was made to the complainant on 10/16/20.\nShe stated that the allegations were relayed to her by Youth A's Wraparound\nWorker. She stated that other team members were present for the wraparound\nmeeting in which Worker 1 disclosed that she was in Youth A's face and disclosed\npersonal information about herself to the team.

She stated that Youth\nA's foster care worker (FCW) was present for the incident between Youth A and\nWorker 1.\nProgram Manager Interview: The program manager was interviewed via video\nconferencing due to the agency offices being closed due to COVID. The Chief\nAdministrator (CA) was also present. The Program Manager stated that Worker 1's\nSupervisor conducted an internal investigation after the Wraparound supervisor\nbrought up the concerns. She stated that the supervisor met with Worker 1 who\nreported that the incident in question with Youth A occurred at Youth A's\ngrandparents' home. The Worker, FCW, Youth A, and grandparents were present.\nThe worker was provided with a training on boundaries and professionalism. The\nProgram Manager stated that Worker 1 is a very passionate worker with a significant\n3",
    "drive to help her clients. She goes above and beyond her job duties. Youth A\nresponds to worker 1 better than other workers. Youth A has reported that everyone\nelse is soft. The program manager stated when the Supervisor talked to the FCW\nand grandparents neither of them had concerns about the Workers interactions with\nYouth A. The program manager stated that Youth A disclosed personal information\nto the wraparound team because she was trying to help them understand why she\ninteracted with Youth A the way she did. The supervisor is and will continue to sit in\non Youth A's wraparound meetings with Worker 1.\nSupervisor Interview: The Supervisor was interviewed on 11/23/20 via video\nconferencing because the agency office is closed due to COVID. The Program\nManager was also on the call. The Supervisor stated she received a phone call from\nthe Wraparound supervisor who relayed concerns that came up about Worker 1.\nThe supervisor contacted Worker 1, Youth A's grandfather, and the FCW.

Worker 1 told the Supervisor that she told the\nteam about her conversation with Youth A, regarding him not following in his\nparents’ footsteps. The Worker was trying to explain that she also did not have a\ngood childhood and she chose not to go down the same path as her parents. This\nwas not something Worker 1 disclosed to Youth A.\nThe Supervisor stated that she did not think Worker 1 crossed a boundary when she\ninteracted with Youth A.

The\nSupervisor stated Worker 1 was trying to express to the team that she could relate to\nYouth A.\nThe Supervisor stated that Worker 1 is a great worker and her families enjoy working\nwith her. She is passionate about her job. Worker 1 has not been disciplined\nregarding these allegations. She did counsel Worker 1 on boundaries during their\nsupervision meetings. She also attends the Wraparound meetings for Youth A to\nprovide Worker 1 with support.\nWorker 1 Interview: Worker 1 was interviewed on 11/23/20 via video conferencing\nbecause the agency office was closed due to COVID. Worker 1 stated that Youth A\ngets very escalated and confrontational. He pushes people metaphorically to see\nwho will go or stay. He told her he hits women. She took a step closer to him but\nwas still six feet from him to let him know she is the adult and he was the child. She\ntold him that hitting her would not make her go away.\n4",
    "During the Wraparound meeting they were discussing Youth A's behaviors. Youth A\nlikes to say he hits women and stabs and shoots people. He tells these stories as a\ndefense during uncomfortable topics. She told the team she delt with Youth A by\nstanding up to him and not letting him intimidate her. This allows Youth A to open up\nto Worker 1. Worker 1 said she never told the team that she got into Youth A's face.\nWorker 1 said she had to clarify what she meant three times because the team was\nnot understanding her. She finally just ended the conversation. Worker 1 said she\nnever told the team she told Youth A to hit her.\nWorker 1 stated that while talking to Youth A he said he was going to be a piece of\nshit and she told him that she had a traumatic childhood too. She told the\nwraparound team her mom was a piece of shit and that she stabbed her brother.\nShe was trying to explain to them that she knew what it felt like to have stabbed\nsomeone and Youth A did not respond as if he actually had stabbed someone.\nWorker 1 said the team took it all out of context.\nWorker 1 said she meets with her Supervisor monthly but talks to her every other\nday. She has talked with her supervisor about when not to disclose personal\ninformation. At her request her supervisor goes to the Wraparound meetings for\nYouth A with Worker 1.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) Interview: The FCW was interviewed via telephone on\n11/23/20. She stated that she was present during the interaction between Youth A\nand Worker 1. She stated that when Youth A stated he was not afraid to hit women\nWorker 1 said you are not going to hit me. They talked it out then gave each other a\nhug. She stated Worker 1 was not aggressive in her interaction with Youth A and\nshe never told him to hit her. She stated Worker 1 did not disclose anything about\nher past to him. She said Worker 1 did show Youth A her bank account balance after\nhe said she was just there for the money.\nDuring the Wraparound meeting the Worker did make a statement about her mother.\nThe Worker was trying to express that she knows what it is like to grow up with\n“piece of shit” parents and that Youth A was not a lost cause. It was brought up that\nYouth A goes around telling people that he stabbed someone. Worker 1 then\nbrought up that she stabbed her brother when she was younger on accident with a\npair of scissors. Worker 1 talked about her remorse and compared it to Youth A's\nlack of remorse when he talks about stabbing people. The FCW stated she did not\nhave any concerns with what Worker 1 said in the Wraparound meeting.\nWraparound Worker Interview: The wraparound Worker was interviewed via\ntelephone on 11/23/20. She stated she was not present for the actual incident\nbetween Worker 1 and Youth A. She said they were discussing Youth A's behaviors\nwhen Worker 1 said she got into Youth A's face and told him to hit her. During the\nmeeting Worker 1 disclosed to the group that she stabbed her brother and that her\n5",
    "mother was a “piece of shit”. She stated the Wraparound meeting took place on\n10/15/20 and the incident with Youth A happened about month prior to the meeting.\nWorker 1’s Employee File: Worker 1 was hired on 8/23/19. She has no disciplines.\nShe received the following trainings:\n De-escalating Hostile Clients on 4/1/20\n Behavior Support and Intervention on 5/18/20\n Boundaries and Professionalism in the workplace were done on 11/24/20\nThe agency provided excerpts from their Code of Conduct. There was nothing that\ntalked about boundaries or disclosure of personal information. It does state that the\nagency, “strives to operate in compliance with applicable laws and appropriate\nethical standards.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training\nto perform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: Worker 1, the Wraparound worker, and the FCW all confirm that\nWorker 1 disclosed to Youth A’s Wraparound team that she had\na “piece of shit” mother and that she stabbed her brother. The\nFCW also reported that Worker 1 showed Youth A her bank\naccount balance when he accused of her doing the job for the\nmoney. Worker 1’s use of disclosing personal information about\nherself in order to make a point with the team and to connect\nwith Youth A indicates she does not have the ability, experience,\neducation, and/or training to perform her duties.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan it is recommended that this\ninvestigation be closed with no further licensing actions.\n12/7/20\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 9, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
