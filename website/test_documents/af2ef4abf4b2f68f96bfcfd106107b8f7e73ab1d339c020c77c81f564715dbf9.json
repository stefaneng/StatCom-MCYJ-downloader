    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nSection\nDescription The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nsupervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for\nthe continual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth E was touched inappropriately, sexually harassed, and hit\nby another youth implying inadequate supervision. Complainant\nnotified law enforcement.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Complainant, also Rights Officer on 1/30/24. He\nsaid Youth E uses they/them pronouns. Later Youth E stated a\npreference for he/him pronouns.\nRights Officer said Youth E resides in Freedom Hall and the other\nyouth (Youth K) resides in DeRoy Hall. To his knowledge, the\nyouths only see each other occasionally at Clara B Ford School\non campus, campus events and “Dream Group” held in the\ncampus-shared gymnasium. Rights Officer said Youth E told him\nhe has been harassed by Youth K for the past two months. Youth\nE could not remember where, when or what staff were supervising\nwhen the harassment occurred. Rights Officer said Youth E only\nidentified one specific incident that occurred on 1/24/24 in the\nshared gym during “Dream Group.” There, he told Rights Officer\nYouth K touched his thigh under a table where they were sitting\ntogether. Rights Officer reported the allegation to local law\nenforcement.\nI notified Youth E’s and Youth K’s MDHHS Workers of the\ninvestigation. They expressed no additional concerns.\nI collaborated with Government Worker 1, and it was decided we\nwould not move forward with interviews without permission from\nlaw enforcement. Law enforcement approved us moving forward\nwith interviews on 1/31/24.\n2",
    "I interviewed Youth E jointly with Government Worker 1 on 2/1/24.\nHe has been at the facility for six months and provided vague and\nconflicting information regarding the allegation. Youth E identified\nbeing “sexually abused” but did not describe any behaviors that\nwould be considered sexual abuse. He said he was “touched on\nthe leg” but was nonspecific regarding where on his leg or in what\ncontext he was touched. He referred to “sexual talk” but did not\ndescribe the words said to him that were sexually provocative or\ninappropriate.\nUntil a separation plan was developed on 1/29/24, Youth E said\nhe and Youth K saw each other in the cafeteria, the “Dream\nGroup” and in class at the charter school on campus. He said\nthere are “always staff all over” supervising.\nYouth E stated Youth K “asked him out” once and he refused.\n“We were acquaintances. I didn’t like her like that…In November\n2023, she’d touch me, and I’d move her hand… Youth K touches\nme, talks sexual and walks away. (In class) She did it sneakily.\n(In the Dream Group) She hit me in the back of the head after I\nmoved her hand. No one saw.” Sometimes the touches\nhappened under tables. “Youth K was trying to get my attention.”\nYouth E said a number of times he wanted to tell staff that Youth\nK “touched” him and “hit the back of his head,” but he did not tell\nanyone until recently because “Youth K told me she’d touch me\nmore if I told anyone.” On 12/21/24 Youth E finally told Staff 1 that\nYouth K touched his thigh at school, and he felt uncomfortable,\nbut he did not tell Staff 1 when this occurred.\nI interviewed Youth K jointly with Government Worker 1. She has\nbeen at the facility for three months. Youth K said she has trust\nissues and made a mistake befriending Youth E. “We got a\nseparation plan. I found out Youth E told other kids and now they\nare calling me a rapist.” she explained. Youth K denied ever\ntouching Youth E inappropriately, hitting him or sexually harassing\nhim. She said the only physical contact the two had were hugs\nand fist bumps.\nYouth K said she and Youth E were in a class at school together\nand sat next to one another in assigned seats. Sometimes in the\n“Dream Group,” they chose to sit together at round tables. Asked\nabout staff supervision in the “Dream Group,” Youth K said youths\nsit about three feet apart and staff sit or stand at the exit doors or\nalong the room’s perimeter. “There are eyes everywhere!” she\nannounced.\n3",
    "Toward the end of the interview, Youth K confessed that at one\ntime, she did have a “crush” on Youth E and suggested they get\ntogether post-discharge.\nDocuments reviewed:\nThere were no incident reports indicating Youth E and Youth K\nwere ever observed by staff touching, hitting, or otherwise acting\ninappropriately.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis Other than Youth E’s own report, there is no evidence Youth K\ntouched Youth E’s leg inappropriately or hit the back of his head\nduring “Dream Group.” There is also no evidence that staff failed\nto supervise the spaces shared by the two youth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection\nDescription (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 did not write an incident report on 12/21/23 prior to the end\nof her shift per Vista Maria's incident report policy.\nInvestigation Documents reviewed:\nAn unprocessed incident report by Staff 1 dated 12/29/23\nindicated Youth E told Staff 1 on 12/21/23 that Youth K was\nrubbing her thigh in class, and it made her uncomfortable.\nI reviewed Vista Maria’s incident report writing policy. The policy\nindicates staff are to complete an incident report and inform the\nshift supervisor of report completion before end of their shift.\nInterview:\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker and Rights\nOfficer. She has worked at the facility for ten months. Staff 1 said\na month ago, Youth E informed her Youth K touched his leg and it\nwas uncomfortable. On another date she said Youth E returned\n4",
    "from school and casually announced, “She did it again.” Staff 1\ndid not ask Youth E who he was referring to or what was done\nagain. Staff 1 recalled Former Therapist came to her after Youth\nE told Therapist that someone from Freedom Hall assaulted her.\nStaff 1 said Therapist thought she knew the name of the youth\nwho assaulted Youth E, but Staff 1 said she did not know of a\nyouth from Freedom Hall because Youth K is in DeRoy Hall. It\nseems Former Therapist had inaccurate information which caused\na miscommunication between herself and Staff 1.\nAnalysis Staff 1 did not follow Vista Maria’s policy for writing incident\nreports and notifying the supervisor prior to the end of the shift.\nNot only was her incident report 8 days late, but it was not process\nthrough the proper channels because the supervisor notification\nbox was not checked on the form.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000511 intake 6/2/23; CAP approved 6/23/23\n2023C0000702SI intake 8/18/23; CAP approved 10/30/23\nRule Code & Rule 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter\nSection care institutions: updated treatment plan.\nDescription\n(3) The updated treatment plan shall include all of the following\ninformation:\n(c) Changes in the treatment plan, including new problems and\nnew goals to remedy the problems. Indicators of goal achievement\nand time frames for achievement shall be specified along with a\nspecific behavior management plan designed to minimize\nseclusion and restraint and that includes a continuum of\nresponses to problem behaviors.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Changes in the treatment plan including new problems such as\nthe need to separate Youth E and Youth K were not identified and\naddressed in a timely manner.\nInvestigation Documents reviewed:\nAn incident report by Former Therapist dated 12/27/23 indicated\nYouth E alleged he was “sexually abused” at Vista Maria and had\nidentified the abuser to Staff 1. He told Therapist he did not want\nto discuss it, would handle it himself and stormed out of the\ntherapy session. Therapist contacted the Social Service\nSupervisor and discussed the incident with Staff 1. Staff 1 stated\n5",
    "Youth E told her a peer in another building touched his leg and\nshe wrote an incident report. Therapist notified Youth E’s MDHHS\nWorker by phone and email.\nAfter Youth E filed a grievance, separation plans dated 1/29/24\nwere developed for Youth E and Youth K. I reviewed the written\nplans which are specific behavior management plans considered\nas an extension of the treatment plan.\nInterview:\nFormer Therapist resigned on 1/19/24. On 2/6/24, Government\nWorker 1 and I attempted to reach her by phone. A voice\nmessage was left.\nStaff 1 said she became aware of the thigh touching allegation on\n12/21/24.\nRights Officer stated Youth E and Youth K continued to attend\nclass and/or Dream Group together until 1/24/24.\nAnalysis Staff 1 said she became aware of the thigh touching allegation on\n12/21/24 and an incident report by Former Therapist indicated she\nnotified MDHHS Worker and Social Service Supervisor of the\nallegation on 12/27/23, but no separation plan was developed.\nYouth E and Youth K continued to attend class and Dream Group\ntogether until 1/24/24 when Youth E filed a grievance. Rights\nOfficer reported the allegation to centralized intake and law\nenforcement and separation plans were put in place on 1/29/24.\nThe separation plans should have been implemented in late\nDecember when the allegation was first made.\nThe facility did not develop the youths’ behavior management\nplans which are extensions of the treatment plan in a timely\nmanner.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n6",
