INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Placement\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404\nSection (1) An agency shall only place a child with an adult who is a\nDescription relative of the child, a legal custodian, or in a licensed\nfoster home, except as permitted in R 400.12503(2)(b) and\nR 400.12709.\n1",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was placed in an unrelated/unapproved home by the\nagency.\nInvestigation Allegation was that Youth A was placed in an unapproved home\nand the caregiver allowed unapproved contact between Youth A\nand the mother of Youth A.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed the Complainant on 10/25/2024. The Complainant\ndid not have any additional information to provide.\nAgency Director was interviewed by phone on 10/25/2024 and\nreported the 3130 evaluation for the caregiver had been\ncompleted to evaluate the placement as a fictive kin placement.\nDirector subsequently learned that the approved caregiver and\nparent were not truthful regarding this relationship with Youth A.\nDirector also learned the approved caregiver was found to have a\nrelationship with the mother of Youth A and was allowing contact\nbetween Youth A and Youth A's mother that was not approved by\nthe supervising agency. The mother of Youth A subsequently\nremoved Youth A from this placement and the previously\napproved caregiver contacted the agency regarding the situation.\nYouth A was later located and replaced into a licensed foster\nhome.\nI interviewed Staff 1 by telephone on 2/24/2025. Staff 1 described\nthe situation consistent with the description reported by Agency\nDirector. Staff 1 stated the initial visit and interview with the\ncaregiver did not include any evidence to indicate the caregiver\nwas not being truthful.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the 5770 – Relative Approval and Placement Safety\nScreen that was completed by Staff 1 and approved by Supervisor\n1 dated 10/10/2024 for the initial placement of Youth A on\n10/10/2024. The initial visit and interview/assessment with the\ncaregiver did not include any evidence to indicate Youth A should\nnot be placed in the home.\nI reviewed the DHS 3130A – Children’s Foster Care Relative\nPlacement Home Study that was completed by Staff 1 with a\n2",
    "denial recommendation dated/signed by Staff 1 and Supervisor 1\non 10/25/2024. The reason for the denial was learning that the\nFictive Kin had not been truthful in the information provided for the\ncompletion of the previously approved 5770. Youth A was\nsubsequently replaced into the home of another\nappropriate/approved caregiver.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with Rule R 400.12404 (1).\nThe 5770 and 3130A evaluations had been completed to\nevaluate/approve/deny this placement as a fictive kin. False\ninformation was reported to the agency in the process of\ncompleting the evaluations resulting in a denial recommendation\nfor the 3130A assessment. The agency subsequently replaced\nYouth A into a licensed foster home when it was learned the\nprevious approval (5770) was determined/based on false\ninformation.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n1/28/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n3/12/2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n3"
