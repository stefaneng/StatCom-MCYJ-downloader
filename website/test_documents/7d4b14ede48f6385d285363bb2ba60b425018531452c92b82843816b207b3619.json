No contact information was available for the complainant. The information\nfrom the complaint states, “On 09/28/2021 Staff at the facility admitted on record that\nYouth A has not been provided therapeutic services in over three months when he is\nsupposed to be receiving these services 3 times per week while at the residential\nplacement.”\nA second complaint was received on 10/12/2021 from the DCWL on-line complaint\nwebsite. The complaint states the following. “Youth B was admitted to the facility on\n09/10/2021 and has not been assigned a therapist. Per Youth B he does not have a\ntherapist and has not been in anyone’s office for therapy.”\nI met with Administrator 1 at the facility on 09/30/2021 and advised her of the\nallegation. Administrator 1 reported that she is filling in for the CA who is currently on\nmedical leave. She acknowledges that they have been short staffed in the therapy\ndepartment, but she is not aware that Youth A’s has not been receiving therapy for 3\nmonths.\nI interviewed Youth A on-site on 09/30/2021. Regarding the allegations, Youth A\nreported that he has been participating in group therapy but has not had individual\ntherapy for several weeks. He reported his therapist left and he has not been\nassigned a new therapist. He could not recall the date of his last session he had\nwith his therapist. He has a weekly check in when his case manager at the facility.\nYouth A reported he feels safe, gets enough to eat, and takes his medication daily.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on site on 09/30/2021. He reported he was present during\nYouth A’s court hearing. He denied that Youth A has not received therapy in 3\nmonths. He reported Youth A’s therapy has been inconsistent because his therapist\nresigned, and he currently does not have a therapist assigned. He does not know\nwhen Youth A’s last individual therapy session was. He reported Youth A is\nparticipating in weekly group therapy. He reported the Youth’s GAL is the one who\nreported Youth A has not received therapy in months.\nI interviewed Director of Behavioral Health on-site on 09/30/2021. He reported Youth\nA is required to have a least one individual therapy session and one group session\nweekly. Youth A is diagnosed with ADHD, and disruptive mood disorder. He\nreported that Youth A’s therapist resigned on 09/29/2021 and Youth A does not\ncurrently have a therapist assigned to him. He does not know when the last therapy\nsession Youth A had with his therapist and will need to review the therapist notes to\nprovide that information. He reported Youth A has been participating in weekly group\n3",
    "therapy and provided the weekly group therapy reports for the months of July,\nAugust, and September.\nI spoke with Youth A’s DHHS worker on 10/01/2021 via telephone.

She further\nreported Youth A has been having frequent contact with his case manager and\nsupport staff at the facility.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 10/04/2021 via telephone. She is Youth A’s case manager.\nShe reported there has been inconsistency in Youth A’s individual therapy because\nhe has had different therapists assigned due to them resigning, and therefore he has\nmissed some individual therapy. She has been meeting with him twice a week and\nhe has been doing well.

He reported he is doing well, but he gets upset when the boys in his cottage\ncuss and swear. He reported he had his first therapy session last week on\nThursday. He indicated he gets enough food, feels safe, and takes his medication\ndaily.\nI interviewed Director of Behavioral Health on-site on 10/15/2021. He reported Youth\nB has been at the facility since 09/10/21 and did not start receiving therapy until\n10/07/21. Youth B had his first therapy session on 10/07/2021. He stated that they\nhad several therapists resign and that has impacted some of the youths receiving\nindividual therapy, but he has been filling in and provided individual therapy for those\nyouths.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 10/21/21 via telephone. She reported that she is currently\nthe assigned therapist for Youth B. She had the first individual session with Youth B\non 10/07/2021. She reported Youth B has adjusted to his placement and is doing\nwell.\nI received an email from Director of Behavioral Health on 10/21/21. He reported\nYouth A’s previous therapist did not log the notes in the system, so while the\nappointments were placed in the system, the notes following were never\ngenerated. This therapist then left with half of their work undone and did not\ncommunicate this to the supervisor. Subsequently, the therapist taking over the case\nleft shortly after and did not meet with Youth A, so from May to August 2021 Youth\nA’s Individual therapy could not verified.\nI received an email from Youth’s B Foster Care Specialist. She stated Youth B was\nplaced at the facility in early September 2021. Youth B did not start therapy until\n10/07/2021. She had contact with the Director or Behavioral Health and he had\n4",
