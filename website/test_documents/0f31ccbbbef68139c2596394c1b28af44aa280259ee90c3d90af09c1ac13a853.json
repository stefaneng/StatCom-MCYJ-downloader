A staff person at the facility was aggressive\nwith the youth and the youth had bruises on their legs and arms\nfrom being pushed into a room to get away from other youth” is\nbeing addressed through SIR #2024SIC0001676.\nINTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 9/4/24.\nComplainant reported Youth A told her she was slapped twice on\nthe arm by a staff during a restraint on 8/27/24 or 8/28/24, but\nYouth A didn’t provide the staff’s name. Complainant reported\nYouth A doesn’t want to be at the facility and Youth A feels if she\npushes hard enough, she will be removed from the facility.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/3/24\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported she\ndoesn’t pay attention to the rules at the facility and doesn’t care\nabout their rules. Youth A reported she doesn’t feel safe because\n“staff like to put hands on [her], push [her] around, and treat [her]\nlike a slave”. Youth A could not provide specific examples of when\nthis occurred. Youth A reported she was restrained on 8/27/24 by\nStaff 2 and Staff 4 because she tried to kill herself. Youth A\nreported Staff 2 and Staff 4 put bruises all over her body. Youth A\ncould not provide a description of how Staff 2 or Staff 4’s actions\ncaused there to be bruises on her body, and she could not provide\na description of exactly where she had bruises on her body. At the\ntime of the interview on 9/3/24, Youth A showed she had one\n2",
    "small bruise on her forearm but showed no other bruises. Youth A\nreported she was trying to cut her arm with a diamond art pen and\nStaff 3 saw her. Youth A reported Staff 3 told Staff 5 and Staff 1\nwhat happened, so all three of them came and took objects from\nher so she couldn’t hurt herself. Youth A reported she shoved the\ndiamond art pen in her bra so no one could take it from her. Youth\nA reported she was then put into a restraint by Staff 2 and Staff 4.\nShe reported they grabbed her arms and put them behind her.\nYouth A reported she was leaning against the wall while staff were\nholding her arms behind her. Youth A reported she then got her\narms away from staff, slid down the wall, sat down with her back\nagainst the wall and began slamming her head against the wall. At\nfirst, Youth A reported she only remembered Staff 2, Staff 3, and\nStaff 4 being present during the restraint. Then Youth A reported\nduring the restraint, Staff 1 grabbed her arm. Youth A reported no\nstaff hit her, slapped her or harmed her during the restraint.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/3/24 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported on 8/27/24,\nStaff 3 told Staff 1 Youth A harmed herself with a diamond art\nstick by scratching her arm with it. Staff 1 reported she and Staff 3\nattempted to get the diamond art stick away from Youth A, but\nYouth A wouldn’t give it to them. Staff 1 reported another staff\n(can’t remember who) was trying to de-escalate Youth A. Staff 1\nreported Youth A calmed down, but then re-escalated and was\nkicking the door to the wing trying to get it to open. Staff 1\nreported Staff 2 approached Youth A and Youth A immediately\nstarted swinging her fists at Staff 2. Staff 1 reported she and Staff\n2 attempted to secure Youth A, but she kept flailing. Staff 1\nreported Youth A accused her of slapping her, but Staff 1 reported\nYouth A flailing while the restraint was being attempted is what\ncaused Staff 1’s hand to contact Youth A’s arm. Staff 1 reported\nshe and Staff 2 were able to restrain Youth A briefly, but then\nYouth A dropped to the floor, so they released the hold. Staff 1\nreported Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, and Staff 6 were present.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via video conference on 10/7/24. Staff\n2 reported he asked Youth A what was going on, but then he saw\nshe had a pen and was self-harming. Staff 2 reported Youth A put\nthe pen in her shirt, so other staff attempted to try and get the pen\nfrom her. Staff 2 reported Youth A began kicking the doors in the\nhallway to get them to open. Staff 2 reported Youth A tried to hit\nStaff 1 once or twice. Staff 2 reported while they were attempting\nto restrain Youth A, Youth A accused Staff 1 of slapping her. Staff\n2 reported Youth A was kicking and flailing her arms, so if Staff 1’s\nhand made contact with Youth A’s body at all, it was because of\n3",
    "Youth A’s actions, and wasn’t intentional by Staff 1. Staff 2\nreported he did not see any staff slap Youth A during the incident\nor restraint.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via video conference on 10/3/24. Staff\n3 reported she, Staff 1 and Staff 5 were present on the unit and\nYouth A was using a diamond art kit. Youth A began trying to\nswallow the diamond art pieces, which Staff 3 advised her against\ndoing. Then Youth A threatened to swallow the whole bag of\ndiamond art pieces, but when asked, Youth A wouldn’t tell staff\nwhy she was upset or trying to harm herself. Staff 3 reported she,\nStaff 1 and Staff 5 continued to try and de-escalate Youth A, and\nasked Youth A to hand over the supplies, but Youth A refused.\nStaff 3 reported after Youth A began harming herself with the\ndiamond art pen, and hid it from staff, Staff 1 attempted a restraint\nto stop Youth A from continuing to harm herself. Staff 3 reported\nwhile Staff 1 was attempting the restraint, Youth A was moving a\nlot and flailing her arms. Youth A said Staff 1 slapped her. Staff 3\nreported she did not see Staff 1’s hand make contact with Youth\nA’s arm. However, Staff 3 reported if any contact between Staff\n1’s hand and Youth A’s arm occurred, it was because Youth A\nwas flailing, and it was not an intentional action by Staff 1. Staff 3\nreported she attempted to explain that to Youth A, but Youth A\nrefused to listen.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 9/26/24 in coordination\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 reported she entered the building to\nspeak to a coworker when she saw the commotion on the unit, so\nshe entered the unit to assist. Staff 4 reported when she entered\nthe unit, Youth A was already escalated. Staff 4 reported Staff 1\nattempted to tap out of the restraint, so Staff 4 attempted to relieve\nher. Staff 4 reported when she stepped in, she couldn’t complete\nthe hold properly, so she stopped. Staff 4 reported while she was\npresent, no staff slapped, hit, or were aggressive with Youth A.\nStaff 4 reported Youth A did not complain of being injured during\nthe restraint.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 9/27/24 in coordination\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 5 reported she doesn’t remember a\nlot from the incident due to the length of time since it occurred.\nStaff 5 reported she remembers Youth A was restrained due to\nself-harming with a diamond art pen, but Staff 5 reported she\nwasn’t involved in the restraint and doesn’t remember who was.\nStaff 5 reported she remembers attempting to verbally de-escalate\nYouth A, but it didn’t work. Staff 5 reported she did not see any\nstaff slap, hit, or harm Youth A during the restraint.\n4",
    "Staff 6 was interviewed via phone on 9/26/24 in coordination\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 6 reported she wasn’t present for an\nincident with Youth A involving a diamond art pen and hasn’t been\ninvolved in any restraints for Youth A.\nVIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 8/27/24 was reviewed. However, the video\nfootage is too dark and too far away since Youth A and staff were\ndown towards the end of the hallway when the incident occurred.\nIt is unclear who the participants are or what occurred in the video.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• MiSACWIS Incident Report #193190238 for incident dated\n8/27/24 states Youth A told Staff 3 she wanted to commit\nsuicide, so Staff 3 immediately informed Staff 1 and Staff 5\nwhat was said. Youth A walked into the living area and was\ncutting her arm with the metal tip of a pen. Staff 2 and Staff\n4 stepped onto the unit to assist. Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3\nall assisted with getting the pen away from Youth A. Youth\nA began kicking the unit door. Staff 2 attempted to use\nverbal de-escalation techniques with Youth A, but to no\navail. Youth A kept kicking the door and began threatening\nphysical harm to staff. Staff 2 attempted to guide Youth A\naway from the door, but Youth A began punching Staff 2.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 placed Youth A in a physical restraint for\napproximately 45 seconds. Youth A dropped to the floor\nand was immediately released. While Youth A was on the\nfloor, she began to punch Staff 1 and Staff 2, so they put\nYouth A in another physical restraint to stop her assaults.\nAfter approximately 2-3 minutes, Staff 4 relieved Staff 1 on\nthe left side. Youth A was in the restraint for approximately\n2 more minutes until she stopped trying to assault staff. A\nnurse looked over Youth A and no injuries were noted.\nThere is no record of Youth A being slapped or hit by any\nstaff.\n• Vista Maria Residential Programs Behavior Management\nPolicy states personal physical intervention shall not be\nimposed as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience,\nor retaliation by staff.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per interviews conducted,\nYouth A and multiple staff reported no staff slapped or hit Youth A.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
