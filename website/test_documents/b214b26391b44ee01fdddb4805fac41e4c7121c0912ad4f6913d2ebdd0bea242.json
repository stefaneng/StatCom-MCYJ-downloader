Staff 2 stated he had\nheard other staff discussing this allegation in the previous weeks\nbut had not heard any youth speak of it. Staff 2 confirmed that\nStaff 1 had addressed this allegation directly with him on one\noccasion, and this discussion quickly turned into an argument.\nStaff 2 believed Youth B was nearby and may have heard this.\n4",

Staff 1 stated she did this purposefully in that she\nwanted to find out more from other staff as to where knowledge of\nthis video may have come from. Staff 1 commented she has\nwritten up youth for making inappropriate comments as she has\nbeen trained on, but did not do so in this instance because she did\nnot want the existence of such a video known and she wanted to\nknow more about who knew about it.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• A “Rule Violation and Disciplinary Consequence record”\ndated 08/13/2024 written by Staff 1 was provided.
