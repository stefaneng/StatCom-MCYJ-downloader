The\nyouth have been combining medication, crushing them, and giving\nthe medication to other youth to take as well as snorting the\nmedications themselves.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant became aware of the allegations while\ncompleting a separate special investigation at the facility (SI\n2025SIC0000541).\nYouth A was interviewed via teams on 4/17/2025 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported she takes\nmedications at the facility including Trazadone, Lexapro, and\nGuanfacine. Youth A reported medications are passed by staff\nwho are medication trained. Youth A reported when she takes her\nmedications, she is provided with her medications and a cup of\nwater. Youth A reported after she takes her medications and\ndrinks the water, staff check in her mouth and have her move her\ntongue around, staff have her pull her cheeks out with her finger,\nand blow to show the medication is no longer in her mouth. Youth\nA reported she has cheeked medications at the facility. Youth A\nreported all staff look in her mouth after she takes her medications\nhowever some staff are “better at looking” such as Staff 1. Youth\nA reported some staff even use a flashlight to look in youth’s\nmouths to ensure youth are not cheeking medications. Youth A\nreported there is not any specific staff that she knows she can\ncheek medications with, it is more of just if she can hide her\nmedication well enough for the staff not to see the medication in\nher mouth. Youth A reported she cheeks her medications\nbecause she feels the medications are not working for her. Youth\nA reported sometimes she will keep her medications and put them\nin a bag and crush them up along with Youth B’s medications.\nYouth A reported she and Youth B sometimes snort the\nmedication to get high. Youth A reported this started when she\nfirst arrived at the facility and stopped for a while, however\nrecently she and Youth B began combining their medications and\ncrushing the medications to snort it. Youth A reported she\nprovided a male youth at the facility her Trazadone (this is being\naddressed in special investigation 2025SIC0000541). Youth A\n2",

Youth B\nreported she had given some of the crushed medications to Youth\nC “a while ago”. Youth B reported she did not “snort” the\nmedications often, she and Youth A would hold medications that\nthey were able to cheek until they had “enough” to crush and\nsnort. Youth B reported all staff check youth’s mouths when youth\ntake medications, it just depends how good she or other youth are\nat cheeking as to if they can get away with it.
