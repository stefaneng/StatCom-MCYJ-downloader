    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Financial stability\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12203\nSection • (1) An agency shall demonstrate sufficient financing, on an\nDescription ongoing basis, to ensure the agency is carrying out its\nprograms and meeting the requirements for licensing. A\nplan of financing must include all the following…..\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There are financial concerns regarding the agency's financial\nstability.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nFinancial Controller, CEO, and Director were interviewed via\nteams on 8/22/2024. Financial Controller reported the agency’s\nfinancial stability continues to improve. The agency has changed\nthe programming at two of the facilities which created a slight\ndecline in June and July 2024 however August is now showing to\nbe trending to the positive. The agency has had no issues with\nmaking payments to staff or foster parents. Currently the facility\nhas a balance in the general fund account of $2.1 million, $2.3\nmillion in the money market, and a donation account with a\nbalance of $120,000. The main issue the agency is facing is the\nWolverine Secure Center building which has not been licensed\nsince 2021. The agency has a loan with Invesco Lending for\napproximately $7 million. The agency is not behind or in default\non this loan. The agency has been working with Invesco Lending\nand made a payment in November 2023 for $1 million. The\nagency negotiated with Invesco Lending in October 2023 and\nbegan making monthly payments of $10,000 and paid $783,000 in\nback interest as Invesco Lending does not want the loan to default\nas they do not want the building. Financial Controller reported the\nWolverine Secure Center building is costing $60,000 a month to\nsit empty. The building has and currently is up for sale. Financial\nController reported Invesco Lending is not foreclosing on the\nWolverine Secure Center and they have agreed to a forbearance\nagreement. The $10,000 monthly payment to Invesco Lending is\nnot largely impacting the agency and that was why the amount\nwas determined and agreed upon.\nIn 2021 and 2022 the agency received funds from the State of\nMichigan and the federal government which did not make up the\ncurrent debit that the agency had which prompted the agency to\nrestructure staffing. The facility had previously been overstaffed\n2",
    "and since COVID and restructuring, the facility in now better\nmanaging staffing needs and aligning staffing more appropriately.\nFinancial Controller reported the facility audit review showed net\nassets in decline which was a result of depreciation. The agency\nremoved $241,000 in depreciation by reducing unnecessary items\nsuch as some agency vehicles, a leased property, building\nequipment, and office equipment (terminated leases on copy\nmachines that were not needed). Financial Controller reported\nalthough the audit findings of the current ratio of .69:1, the agency\nwould be able to pay off the Comerica loan if it came due\nimmediately through the funds in the money market account. The\nComerica loan remains to have a balance just shy of $2 million\nwhich was from 2008 when Vassar House was built, and updates\nwere completed at the Vassar sites. The agency has and\ncontinues to make monthly payments on this loan. If the Invesco\nLending loan came due today, the agency would not be able to\npay off the loan. The agency reported this would not occur due to\nthe agency coming to an agreement with Invesco Lending on\nmonthly payments.\nCEO and Financial Controller reported the agency is meeting all\nthe youth needs at the facility and the financial stability of the\nagency continues to not impact any of the youth’s needs.\nFinancial Controller reported loan payments are in good standing\nas are utilities. Financial Controller reported the facility accrued a\nlot of damages at the facilities with broken doors and windows.\nThe average cost of a door and door frame to be replaced is\n$4,000-$5,000 and there had been approximately thirty to forty\ndoors as well as windows recently replaced in the last couple of\nmonths.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1, Foster Care Supervisor 2, and\nFoster Care Worker were interviewed utilizing video\nconferencing on 9/6/2024, 9/9/2024, and 9/11/2024,\nrespectively. They all reported no concerns with agency’s ability\nto pay staff or foster parents timely. They all stated there have\nbeen no concerns with providing needed services to youth and\nfamilies because of agency finances. They all indicated the\nagency can provide for things such as bus passes when needed\nby families. Foster Care Worker stated she will sometimes pay for\nsmall things like a meal for a youth or family out of pocket and she\nhas never had an issue with the agency reimbursing her timely if\nthe correct paperwork was completed. Foster Care Supervisor 1,\nFoster Care Supervisor 2, and Foster Care Worker all stated they\nhave not heard of any financial concerns at the agency.\n3",
    "Documents reviewed:\n• Financial Memo provided by the Bureau of Audit: After\nreview of the Wolverine Human Services Audit Report for\nthe Fiscal Year Ending 9/30/2023 dated 7/30/2024 there\nwere concerns that the facility was in declining financial\ncondition. There was a decline in total net assets indicating\nrevenues exceed expenses as the agency has a decline in\nnet assets of 4.05%. There is negative working capital, and\na ratio of 0.69:1. A ratio under 1 suggests that the agency\ncould be unable to pay off its obligations if they came due\nimmediately.\n• Wolverine Human Services Audit Report for the Fiscal Year\nEnding 9/30/2023 dated 7/30/2024 noting ongoing\nconcerns of the agency’s financial stability. Prior to fiscal\nyear end, the agency had received approval for certain rate\nper diem increases, re-opened certain residential\nprograms, and continues to list certain property for sale.\n• Comerica Bank Loan Payment Notice dated 7/31/2024\nshowed the agency in good standing.\n• Wolverine Human Services Statement of Activities-Current\nYear Comparison to Budget for period ending 6/30/2024\nshowed in the positive for net assets.\n• AP Aging Summary Spreadsheet for Utilities and Foster\nParents and leases demonstrating all payments have been\nmade that were due per the agency internal records.\n• Vassar Water and Sewer Utility bill dated 9/3/2024 showed\nthe facility is up to date on payment.\n• DTE bill for September 2024 showed the facility is up to\ndate with payment.\n• Consumers Energy bill dated 9/3/2024 showed the facility\nis up to date with payment.\n• Repayment Agreement dated 10/18/2023 between\nWolverine Human Services and Invesco Lending states the\nrepayment agreement shall be effective from 10/18/2023\nand shall continue through the repayment period.\n• Email from Financial Controller dated 9/4/2024: The reason\nfor the auditor’s disclaimer response was attributed to the\nlack of information as of the report date regarding the debt\nresolution with the Wolverine Secure building as it was\nundetermined at that time whether the agency was going to\nsell or reopen another program at the site within the next\n4",
    "year. Financial controller included verification in the email\nof payments to Invesco Lending.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as per interviews with staff, the\nfacility’s financial stability is not impacting the facility’s ability to\nprovide foster care services, pay staff, and pay foster parents.\nThe agency is in good standing with loans and utilities as agreed\nupon payments are being made.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nSeptember 30, 2024\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
