The agency was advised to update photos at the time of case intake.\n It was recommended the agency develop an AWOL checklist outlining the\nrequirements of licensing rules and policy FOM 722-03A.

The CA indicated security\ncameras are in the home and clear staff boundaries are already in place.

The CA indicated they will continue to evaluate the\nsituation before making any decisions.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency was not required to submit any corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was discussed with the Chief Administrator\n(CA) during the entrance meeting on 1/11/22.

Three youth remain in the program, and one went\nAWOL. Overall, the CA reported they have begun developing positive relationships\nwith the local DHHS office, law enforcement and other community partners. The CA\nwas advised DCWL is always available for consultation as they continue to learn\nmore about the child welfare system. As the agency staff continue to learn the\n6",
    "nuances of child welfare, abundant technical assistance was provided throughout\nthe review, which the CA reported to find helpful.\nInterviews\nTwo staff were interviewed and reported the past six months has been a positive\nlearning experience. The staff did not share any concerns at this time.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nA field analyst review was not completed as this agency services Independent Living\nyouth only.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes, rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n_ ________________January 20, 2022____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 21, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
