Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nYouth has had their confidential mail opened by agency even after their court case\nwith the state has been terminated and youth moved out.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 3/3/2022 I received a complaint through the on-line reporting system from a\nformer resident of an independent living home. The youth alleged that she had two\npieces of mail that were delivered to the home/agency and were opened prior to her\nreceiving them from the agency. She reported that one of the pieces of mail had her\nformer foster care worker’s name written on the front.\nOn 3/8/2022 I interviewed Youth A by telephone. Youth A reported that she has\nchanged her mailing address with the post office, but she has still had some mail\ndelivered to the agency or the independent living home in which she lived. She\nstated that, when this happens, the agency will send her mail to her in a manilla\nenvelope. She states that on at least two occasions the mail she received in the\nmanilla envelop had already been opened. One of these pieces of mail was\n2",
    "addressed to Youth A at the agency and was a check from the government treasury.\nThis envelope was open and had her former foster care worker’s first name\nhandwritten on the front. Youth A provided me with a photo of this envelope which I\nreviewed on 3/8/2022. Youth A stated that she also received an opened piece of\nmail from the agency that contained a replacement debit card. This envelope had\nthe youth’s name and the address of the home in which she resided. Youth A stated\nthat she did not know who opened the mail, but she suspected it was either Foster\nCare Worker or Lead Youth Specialist.\nOn 3/10/2022 I interviewed Program Manager and Foster Care Worker in person at\nthe agency. Foster Care Worker stated she recalled mailing the envelope with the\ndebit card to Youth A and stated that the envelope was already opened when she\nreceived it from the home. She stated that if the other piece of mail came to the\nagency office, agency support staff would have opened the mail and written Foster\nCare Worker’s name on the envelope. She stated that this is how all of the youth’s\nmail is handled even if the youth’s case is closed. Program Manager stated that she\nwasn’t aware that this was how youth’s mail was handled and would be addressing it\nimmediately.\nOn 3/10/2022 I interviewed Office Manager by telephone as she was working\nremotely. She stated support staff will open all mail received at the agency unless it\nis marked as confidential.\nOn 3/16/2022 I interviewed Lead Youth Specialist by telephone. She reported she\nhas not opened any of Youth A’s mail and if the agency received mail from the home\nthat was already opened, she didn’t know who would have opened it.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12213 Record Management.\nAn agency shall do all of the following with respect to\nmaintenance of required records:\n(c) Store and maintain each record in a manner to ensure\nconfidentiality and to prevent unauthorized access.\nANALYSIS: A youth’s confidential mail was opened by agency staff.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",
