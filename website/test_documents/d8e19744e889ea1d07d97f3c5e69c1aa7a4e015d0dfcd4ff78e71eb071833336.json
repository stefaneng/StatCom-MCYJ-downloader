Administrator\n1 stated Foster Care Worker 1 admitted to the relationship and a termination of\nemployment agreement was negotiated with Foster Care Worker 1. The termination of\nemployment of Foster Care Worker 1 was effective 03/04/2022. Administrator 1 stated\nlaw enforcement had also been notified due to the concern Foster Care Worker 1 had\nused his position of authority as a part of establishing the inappropriate relationship.\nI received the requested information from Administrator 1 on 03/14/2022. The\ninformation included a copy of the termination agreement that was negotiated with\nFoster Care Worker 1 as well as the identity of the children and mother with whom\nFoster Care Worker 1 had the relationship.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 by telephone on 05/05/2022.
