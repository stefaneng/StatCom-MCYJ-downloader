    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth is allegedly pregnant by a staff member.\nInvestigation This complaint was assigned on 06/12/2023 and investigated in\ncollaboration with DHHS Specialist.\nI spoke with MDHHS Specialist on 06/12/2023. She reported\nYouth A was discharged from Lincoln Center in March of 2023\nand is currently at the Juvenile Detention Center. MDHHS\nSpecialist attempted to interview Youth A on 06/09/2023, Youth A\ncussed at her, insisted she was not pregnant, and refused to be\ninterviewed.\nI interviewed Youth A at the Juvenile Detention Center (JDC) on\n06/14/2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Specialist and MDHHS\nSupervisor. Youth A has been at JDC since 05/22/2023. Youth A\nwas discharged from Lincoln Center in March of 2023. Youth A\nadamantly denied ever having a relationship or being pregnant by\na staff member at Lincoln Center. Youth A denied knowing of any\nother youth having an inappropriate relationship with staff while\nshe was at Lincoln Center. Youth A said Staff 2 made\ninappropriate remarks about her butt, and looked at her weird, but\nhe never did anything to her. She said that staff member made\ninappropriate remarks to other youths and would reference his\nprivate part as “monster and gator man.” This was investigated on\n05/17/2023 in Special Investigation 2023C0000468, so it was not\naddressed again in this investigation.\nI interviewed Director at the facility, in collaboration with MDHHS\nSpecialist. Director was informed last week by Staff 1 of the\nallegations. Staff 1 was informed of the allegations last week,\nwhile they were tutoring a youth who was previously placed at the\nfacility, The youth told Staff 1 that in January 2023 Youth A told\nher she was pregnant from a male staff at the facility. She said\nYouth A was discharged to her mother in March 2023. Director\nwas not aware of any reports or concerns regarding staff and\nYouth A. Furthermore, there are no reports of any youth being\npregnant at the facility.\n2",

Staff 2 works as 2nd Shift Supervisor and\nhas been working at the facility for 15 years. He denied having a\nsexual relationship with any current or past youths at the facility,\ncalling his private parts “monster and gator man, and speaking\ninappropriately with any of the youths.\nMDHHS Specialist held a predisposition conference held on\n07/12/2023 with MDHHS Specialist and Supervisor.
