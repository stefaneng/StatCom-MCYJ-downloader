Physical Description of Facility\nThe facility is a one-story building. It has small individual offices for all the workers, a\nconference room, kitchen, playroom, and storage room. Lutheran Social Services of\nMichigan leases a private office in the back of the building to a therapist. The space is\nadequate for the services provided.\nB. Program Description\nLutheran Social Services of Michigan (LSSM) contracts with the Michigan Family\nIndependence Agency, Community Mental Health Boards and other organizations to\noffer general foster care to children, zero through 17 years old, who cannot live with\ntheir families due to such factors as abuse, neglect, and abandonment. Social workers\nare assigned to specific children and are responsible for case planning for the entire\ntime the children are in foster care placement. LSSM supports Michigan’s commitment\nto permanency for children, with the primary goal of returning children to their homes if\nat all possible. In cases where reunification with the birth family is not in the best\ninterest of the children, alternative permanency arrangements are pursued.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nNone.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend the issuance of a provisional license.\n________________________________________\nPamela G.
