The agency is\ncurrently complying with the CAP action steps, and DCWL continues to\nmonitor CAP compliance with no noted concerns.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facilities financial audit was reviewed by Michigan Department of Health &\nHuman Services Bureau of Audit due to concerns noted in past audit findings. The\norganization continues to have a decline in total net assets and a negative working\ncapital. There were repeated findings for the 2022 and 2023 audit. Corrective\nmeasures will be requested and required to mitigate the finding by the Bureau of\nAudit as the facility continues to not have staffing to complete the accounting\nfunctions including segregation of duties. The facility’s corrective measures\nindicated the Board of Directors would be involved in the day-to-day accounting\nprocess so that one individual is not responsible for three transaction components,\nauthorization, custody, and recordkeeping. It appears that the Board of Directors\nhas not been involved in this process and the facility is not following their\ncorrective measures. The organization’s financial condition will continue to be\nmonitored.\nAlthough there are continuing concerns regarding finances, this has not affected\nthe care of the youth at the facility.\nPREA compliance\nAgency completed their most recent PREA audit on 9/23/2024.
