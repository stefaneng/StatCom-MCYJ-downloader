The\nfacility was aware of one of the youth's inappropriate sexual behavior upon being\nadmitted into the facility. While youth were recently separated, they can still have\naccess if there is inadequate supervision.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was transferred for investigation on 10/25/21,\nYouth A (9) is a permanent ward placed at Methodist Children's Home Society.\nYouth A and Youth B (last name unknown) both resided in the same cottage\ntogether. There were inappropriate sexualized behaviors that occurred between\nthe two and the facility continued to allow them to reside in the same cottage.\nThere were numerous incident reports for physical aggression between the two.\nThe recent incident of sexualized behavior between the two was due to improper\nsupervision. Youth A was giving oral sex to Youth B. Methodist Children's Home\nSociety was informed of Youth A’s history of inappropriate sexual behavior upon\nhim moving into the facility. The facility has reported that they have moved the\nchild, Youth B, to a different cottage, but the children could have access to each\nother if there is not adequate supervision.\nDuring a PCU conference call on 10/25/21, Youth A’s worker, Youth B’s worker, and\nthe PCU staff reported that this incident of sexual acting out had been previously\nreported and dismissed, however, additional information was learned, and they\nwanted to rereport it. I followed up via email with the complainant on 10/25/21. The\ncomplainant reported that to their knowledge, there was an investigation of this\n3",
    "incident, which occurred 10/01/21. The complainant said that the youth were allowed\nto go into another room while the staff and other youth watched a movie in a\ndifferent room. The complainant reported the person to contact regarding the\ninvestigation was the PCU staff. In following up with the PCU staff via email, the\nPCU staff said that the information they had was directly from the foster care\nworkers for Youth A and Youth B and they didn’t have anything additional.\nMiSACWIS information was reviewed for the original incident (ID 85686544), and it\nwas found that this incident was previously reported on the same day of the incident,\n10/01/21, by the facility. The report noted the following.\nIn the afternoon hours of 10/1/21 Youth A performed oral sex on Youth B. This\nincident took place in the living room area of the home. This occurred randomly\nout the blue and very quickly. Staff was present in the room and immediately\nintervened and notified supervision of the incident. The two have since been\nseparated and have both been sent out to the ER for further evaluation. The\nhome is following appropriate steps moving forward for notification of necessary\nand responsible parties and a safety plan will be devised to ensure both children\nare separated and kept safe. The home does not have video surveillance for\nreview of the matter.\nAn incident of physical aggression between these two youth and staff supervision\nwas investigated by DCWL in SIR 2021C0108040 and no violations were found for\nimproper supervision. Email follow-up with the investigating DCWL Consultant found\nthat the facility did not promise to keep the two youths separated after this incident\nbut had temporarily separated them.\nOn 11/08/21, Youth A’s FCW reported the following via email. The FCW had visited\nYouth A at the facility on 11/03/21 and arrived when Youth A was getting off the bus.\nThe FCW walked Youth A back to the cottages from the bus stop. Youth A reported\ntypically having four staff during the day and one at night in his cottage and\nconfirmed the safety plan is being followed. The FCW said that they addressed with\na cottage staff that there was no one at the bus stop to get Youth A and the staff\nsaid the regular staff member that picks Youth A up from the bus stop was sick that\nday and the designated substitute was late. On 11/10/21, the FCW confirmed that\nthe safety plan is for direct line of sight supervision for Youth A.\nI met with the Director of Residential Services (DRS), on 10/27/21, at the facility. The\nDRS said that she had reviewed this incident and it was being internally\ninvestigated. Youth B has been moved to another cottage and there is a safety plan\nin place for each youth. The DRS said that supervisors came in the following\nweekend to check on staff, provide additional monitoring, and ensure that the\nyouth’s safety plans were being followed.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility, on 10/27/21. Youth A reported that he recalled\nan incident on 10/01/21. Youth A said that he knows Youth B but doesn’t like him.\nYouth A recalled Youth B being at the cottage as well as Staff 1. Youth A said that\nhe was watching television with his peers when he went to his bedroom to get a toy.\n4",
    "Youth A said that Youth B came and grabbed his toy and ran off with it, so Youth A\nchased Youth B. Youth A said that Youth A pulled his pants down and showed\nYouth A his “privates.” This reportedly occurred in the corner of the smaller living\nroom/playroom. Youth A said that Youth B tried to get him to “do other stuff and I\ndid.” Youth A did not provide further detail but did say he did not remember if he\ntouched Youth B’s “privates.” Youth A said he was only in his bedroom a couple of\nseconds when retrieving the toy and was only in the back living room with Youth B\nfor a couple of minutes total. Youth A said that Staff 1 was in the kitchen when this\noccurred. Youth A said this incident happened quickly and when Staff 1 saw them\nshe told Youth A to go to the other room. It was at this time that Youth A walked out\nof the cottage.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility, on 10/27/21, but he was not open with\ninformation. Youth B reported that he is now in Harrison cottage but was in Cotcher.\nYouth B recalled an incident on 10/01/21 and said that he was asleep in the\nplayroom in the corner. Youth B said that when he fell asleep, he was alone in the\nroom and Youth A was not there. Youth B said that he also woke up alone and then\nwent back to the living room to watch television with the rest of the group. Youth B\nsaid that Staff 1 was moving between the kitchen area and the back by the\nbedrooms when he fell asleep. When he woke up, Youth B said that Staff 1 was in\nthe kitchen area, which is between the two rooms where the youth were.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility, on 10/27/21. Staff 1 reported that she was\nworking in the cottage on the morning of the incident, on 10/01/21, and stated that\nshe was supervising five youth. It was noted that she had four, but Youth A returned\nfrom school unexpectedly. Staff 1 said that she had all of the youth in the front room\nwatching television when Youth B asked if he could go to the back room to separate\nhimself and think. Staff 1 allowed this and noted she monitored him by walking the\nhall between the front living room and back room. Staff 1 said that Youth A “hopped\nup” and went to his bedroom and dropped his shoes by his door. Youth A then\nwalked around the back hall and into the back living room where Youth B was. Staff\n1 said that Youth A sat down, and Staff 1 prompted him to go back to the front room\nto watch television with the other youth. Youth A refused. Staff 1 said that she was\nnot going to verbally escalate the situation and wasn’t going to physically move\nYouth A, so she just went on to monitor both rooms by walking back and forth\ncontinuously. Staff 1 said that she would walk through the kitchen, which separates\nthe two rooms, and by walking around the back hall by the bedrooms. Staff 1 said\nshe only took a few seconds between checks of each room since they are so close\nto one another. On the third check of Youth A and Youth B in the back room, Staff 1\nsaid that she saw Youth A bent over with his “butt” up and his face down near Youth\nB’s private area. Staff 1 said that she didn’t see any skin or Youth B’s penis. Staff 1\nsaid that she told Youth A to stop, and Youth A hopped up and walked out of the\ncottage. Staff 1 said that neither youth has said what happened that day.\n5",
    "Documentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Internal investigation dated 11/08/21. The report provided an account by Staff\n1 consistent with her interview. However, the report noted that Staff 1 initially\ntold an administrator that she was in the kitchen cooking when the incident\noccurred, which was in contrast to the rest of the report and her interview.\nThe report noted that Staff 1 said she and another staff had nine youth that\nmorning. The report also noted up to five youth with Staff 1 at the cottage at\ntimes during that morning. The report had mixed conclusions noting Human\nResources “determined that Staff 1 demonstrated that she did not have\nappropriate knowledge of the children’s whereabouts,” and the Director of\nChildren’s Services “did not determine that Staff 1 demonstrated having a\nlack of appropriate knowledge of the children’s whereabouts.”\n Internal Incident Report, dated 10/01/2021, authored by Staff 1. The incident\nreport was consistent with Staff 1’s interview.\n Safety plan for Youth A, dated 10/01/2021. Among other things, the plan\nnoted direct line of sight and no contact with Youth B.\n Safety plan for Youth B, dated 10/01/2021. Among other things, the plan\nnoted direct line of sight and no contact with Youth A.\n Supervisor Safety Plan, dated 10/01/2021, authored by DRS. Directed\nsupervisors to review the youth’s safety plans and ensure they are followed.\nAdditional staffing supports for the weekend were established as well.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: The staff was providing active supervision. The staff did not\nallow the youth to be together and tried to get Youth A to leave\nthe area, but Youth A refused, so Staff 1 continued to monitor\nthe youth in the two rooms, which were observed not to be far\napart (and of an open concept floorplan, although not\ncompletely open). It appears that Youth A and Youth B were\nable to manipulate the small window of opportunity in this\ninstance to act out sexually. This was noted by the staff and\nstopped immediately.\nWhile there is no violation related to allegations, there is a\nviolation of this rule, as Youth A has an established safety plan\nthat includes direct line of sight supervision, but the facility did\nnot ensure a staff was present to monitor him from the bus on\nthe day of the FCW visit.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2022C0108003, intake 10/11/21, CAP approved 11/16/21\nSIR 2020C0108009, intake 11/26/19, CAP approved 01/13/20\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nDuring the course of this investigation, it was found that the facility was out of ratio\non the morning of this incident, 10/01/2021.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as Staff 1 reported to be\nalone with five youth on the day of this incident. This is\nsupported by the internal investigation notes which additionally\nnoted that there were two staff with nine residents the morning\nof this incident when the facility ratio is one staff per four\nresidents.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2021C0207024, intake 07/20/21, CAP approved 09/22/21\nSIR 2021C0108045, intake 07/13/21, CAP approved 08/25/21\n(cited as a contract violation for ratio)\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\nNovember 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n8"
