No new information was\nprovided.\nOn 9/28/23, I spoke to Administrator 1. Administrator 1 reported\nYouth A threw urine on Staff 1 and then Staff 1 was aggressive\nwith Youth A, punching him.\nI spoke to DHHS Worker 1. Scheduling was discussed.\nVideo Footage:\nI watched the video footage. The incident occurred on 9/26/23 at\n2:17pm. I watched video footage from 2:17:00pm - 2:19:18pm.\nThe youth on the unit were in a circle, sitting down. Staff 1 was\nsitting in the circle next to Staff 2 and Staff 5 was standing up\noutside of the circle. Youth A left the circle went to his room and\nbrough back a small cup filled with liquid at 2:17:32. Youth A threw\nthe liquid on Staff 1. The liquid was confirmed to be Youth A’s\nurine. At 2:17:40, Staff 1 stood up and punched Youth A and\nthrew Youth A up against the wall. At 2:17:44 Staff 1 pushes\nYouth A face down into the ground. Youth A falls and Staff 1\nplaces himself on top of Youth A and remains there. At 2:18:02\n2",
    "Staff 1 picks him up and throws Youth A back down to the ground.\nAt 2:18:08, Staff 1 picks up Youth A again and throws him back to\nthe ground. Staff 1 has his hands around Youth A’s neck when he\nthrows him to the floor. At 2:18:19, Staff 1’s left hand is around\nYouth A’s neck, and he is holding Youth A to the floor. At 2:18:48,\nStaff 1’s hand is now on the left side of Youth A’s neck holding\nhim to the floor and security officers now come into the unit and\nare able to get Staff 1 away from Youth A. Youth A is placed into\nhis bedroom. Staff 1 has been removed from the unit.\nThroughout this incident, Staff 2 and Staff 5 were attempting to get\nStaff1 away from Youth A but were unable to do this.\nAll interviews were conducted with DHHS Worker 1 unless\notherwise specified.\nInterviews:\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported he threw urine on Staff 1 because Youth B\nthreatened to assault him if he did not do it. Youth A reported that\nYouth B hit him about a month ago and since then threatens him\nand takes his snacks and food. Youth A reported that Youth B will\ntake his food in the dining hall and at 3:00pm snack time. Youth A\nreported that Youth B runs the unit. Youth A reported Supervisor 1\nand Therapist 1 were aware he was being bullied by Youth B.\nThey were both aware he was giving away snacks and dinners to\nYouth B. Youth A reported that Supervisor 1 would give him extra\nsnacks at night because he knew he was giving his away. Youth A\nreported he threw urine on Staff 1 and then Staff 1 grabbed him by\nthe neck and punched him a couple times. Youth A reported Staff\n1 pinned him to the ground and was choking him and he couldn’t\nbreathe at times.

The incident occurred at 2:17pm. It was noted\nas a “staff assault on resident.” The incident report stated, “Staff 1\ncharged towards Youth A, throwing a punch with his left\nhand…grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed Youth A to the\nfloor with his hands around his neck…\nAnalysis Video footage clearly displays Staff 1 assaulting Youth A by\npunching, choking, throwing, pushing, and pulling Youth A.\nInterviews confirm as well as incident Report.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000437; Intake 5/2/23 with approved CAP\n2023C0000650SI; Intake 7/26/23 with approved CAP\n2023C0000773; Intake 9/19/23 with approved CAP\n2020C0207002; Intake 10/5/21 with approved CAP\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4162 Seclusion within secure and nonsecure\nSection facilities; seclusion plan; prohibitions; reductions and\nDescription elimination.\n(6) Staff may not place youth in seclusion for fixed periods of\ntime.

    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was placed in seclusion at 2:19pm and was not removed\nuntil 4:30. There is no documentation on why Youth A was placed\nin seclusion or how he was monitored.\nInvestigation I reviewed video of the incident.\nYouth A was placed into his room at 2:19pm on 9/26/23 after he\nwas assaulted by Staff 1.\nInterviews:\nStaff 2:\nStaff 2 reported she saw Youth A throw urine on Staff 1. Staff 1\nthen assaulted Youth A. Staff 2 reported she attempted to remove\nStaff 1 from Youth A but was unable to. Staff 2 reported that other\nstaff came in and were able to pull Staff 1 off of Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported that Youth A then was placed in his room and\ncame out two hours later when the nurse saw him.\nStaff 2 was reinterviewed on 11/9/23 and reported that Youth A\ndid not stay in seclusion long maybe an hour or two. Staff 2\ncompleted the seclusion log checks from 2:30-3:30pm. Staff 2\nreported that 15-minute checks were completed. Staff 2 reported\nthat Youth A would talk with her at the door. Staff 2 reported that\nhe was not yelling or cussing. Staff 2 reported he was doing “fine.”\nStaff 5:\nStaff 5 was reinterviewed on 11/9/23 and reported that Youth A\nwas calm while in his room. Staff 5 completed the seclusion log\nchecks from 3:45-4:30pm. Staff 5 reported that he was “chill” and\nstated Youth A was asking why he was in seclusion. Staff 5\nreported she did see supervisors come in and talk to him, but they\ndid not talk to her to see how he was doing. Staff 5 reported that\nwhen they came into the room Youth A was calm as well.\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported after the incident he was placed into his room for\nseclusion until 4:30 where he then saw the nurse.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the Unusual Incident Report dated 9/26/23.\nYouth A was placed into seclusion after he was assaulted by Staff\n1. Reason was not documented on the form.\nI reviewed the Medical Assessment dated 9/26/23. Youth was\nseen at 4:30pm.\n5",
    "I requested seclusion documents on 10/30/23 and 11/4/23. No\ndocumentation was provided.\nDocumentation was received on 11/8/23 for seclusion. Behavior\nmanagement/Seclusion Room Logging was reviewed. Youth went\ninto seclusion at 2:45pm and was removed at 4:30. The logging\nstates the reason why Youth A was placed in seclusion was\n“assault.”\nStaff 2 initials were placed on the time frame 2:30-3:30pm and\nStaff 5 from 3:45-4:30pm.\nAdministrative Review Form for use of Seclusion Room was\nreviewed. Supervisor 2 reported that at 3:00pm and at 3:45pm\nYouth A, “did not appear to be under emotional control.” Seclusion\nwas continued due to this issue.\nAnalysis Youth A was placed in seclusion at 2:19pm and stayed in\nseclusion until 4:30pm. The reason Youth A was placed in\nseclusion was assault. Seclusion documentation for the 15-\nminute checks did not describe the behavior of the youth during\nthose intervals but interviews with Staff 2 and Staff 5 verify the\nyouth was calm and did not display any emotional turbulence\nwhile in the room. Staff 5 reported that when the supervisors did\ncome to check on Youth A, he was calm.\nYouth A was placed into seclusion due to being assaulted by Staff\n1. Initially, placing Youth A into the room while removing Staff 1\nwould help in maintaining safety. Once Staff 1 was removed from\nthe unit, there was no need for Youth A to be in seclusion.\nSupervisor 2 reported in documentation that Youth A did not\nappear to be emotionally under control, yet none of the staff\ncompleting the checks verified this. Seclusion is not to be used for\nfixed period of times and can only be used when youth is\nengaging in behaviors that threaten the immediate harm of others.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe youth observation sheet, concerning the 15-minute interval\nlogging should also acknowledge the behaviors the youth is\npresenting if the youth will remain in the seclusion room.\nThe Administrative Review Form for Use of Seclusion Room does\nnot have an area to write out what behaviors the youth is\nperforming to remain in seclusion. In this particular case, Youth A\nhad a check box stating, “The youth does not appear to be under\n6",
    "emotional control.” This statement is vague. Another checkbox\nstates, “The youth states he us unwilling to cooperate with\nprogram expectations.” This is not a reason outlined in the rules to\ncontinue seclusion. Documentation appears to be outdated and\ndoes not coincide with all seclusion procedures. The agency will\nneed to look at their processes, documentation and review to\nensure the proper procedures are practiced.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4163 Health status assessment; notification;\nSection debriefing; reporting.\nDescription\n(1) The agency shall develop and implement written\nprocedures for health status screening, notifications,\ndebriefing, and reporting when a restraint including an\nemergency restraint, or seclusion is used.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff placed Youth A into seclusion and did not follow procedures.\nInvestigation Youth A:\nYouth A reported after the incident he was placed into his room for\nseclusion until 4:30, after which he then saw the nurse.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the Unusual Incident Report dated 9/26/23. Youth A\nwas placed into seclusion after he was assaulted by Staff 1. The\nreason was not documented on the form.\nI reviewed the Medical Assessment dated 9/26/23. Youth was\nseen at 4:30pm.\nI requested seclusion documents on 10/30/23 and 11/4/23. No\ndocumentation was provided.\nI reviewed the current Use of Seclusion Room and Reintegration\nForm Seclusion Policy. The current policy is not updated to reflect\nRule 400.4163.\nAnalysis The agency does not have written procedures, specifically\nconcerning the health status screening.\n7",
    "Technical Assistance: The agency will need to look at their\ncurrent policies and update them in accordance with Rule\n400.4163 and Rule 400.4162. Both rules outline seclusion and\ncertain processes that must be implemented in the agency policy.\nIt is advised that the Final Rule Restraint and Seclusion to be\nreviewed to ensure all the agency’s policies align with these rules\nthat became effective 5/24/2022.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nDescription service policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation After youth was physically assaulted by Staff 1, youth was not\nseen by medical staff immediately.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nNurse 1:\nNurse 1 reported that staff are to send a referral for youth to the\nmedical department for the medical staff to see youth. Nurse 1\nreported that she did not have a referral for Youth A in their file.\nNurse 1 was shown the Medical Assessment and she reported\nthat she had not filled that particular one out.\nStaff 5\nStaff 5 reported after the incident she was instructed to keep\nYouth A in his room. Staff 5 did not state who instructed her to\nkeep him in his room. Staff 5 reported she would check on him\nand ask him if he was okay. Staff 5 reported she was concerned\nabout Youth A being hurt. Staff 5 reported she was trying to make\nsure his head wasn’t hurt badly by monitoring him. Staff 5 reported\nYouth A had scratches on his neck and his skin was red from\nbeing “tossed” around. Staff 5 reported that “guards” came in later\nand took him to the nurse.\nI reviewed video of the incident.\nYouth A was placed into his room at 2:19pm on 9/26/23.\n8",
    "Documents:\nI reviewed the Health Services Policies and Procedures:\n“When a youth…is in need of emergency medical care, the\nSupervisor is to contact the Facility Nurse and Facility Physician\nor Psychiatrist to arrange treatment at the appropriate medical\ncenter.”\nI reviewed the Unusual Incident Report Summary:\nThe incident was written on 9/26/23. The incident occurred at\n2:17pm. It was noted as a “staff assault on resident.” The incident\nreport stated, “Staff 1 charged towards Youth A, throwing a punch\nwith his left hand…grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed\nYouth A to the floor with his hands around his neck…”\nI reviewed a Medical Assessment Note dated 9/26/23.\nThe medical assessment was noted Youth A was seen at 4:30.\n“Youth reports throwing urine on staff. Staff then assaulted\nresident by pushing him into the wall then slammed him onto the\nfloor punching him in the face numerous times then pulled up from\nfloor and choked until gasped for air.”\nThe medical assessment noted he had “mild bruising on nose,\nscratches on neck, chest, shoulders and right hand, abrasions on\nleft wrist and swelling.” Staff were to monitor for 24 hours in case\nof “neuro changes”. X-rays were ordered.\nI reviewed the Radiology Report dated 9/27/23:\nNo evidence of acute fracture or dislocation in the wrist. No acute\ncardiopulmonary process. No soft tissue abnormality or foreign\nbody (neck). No acute nasal bone fracture (nose).\nAnalysis Youth was physically assaulted by Staff 1 at 2:17pm and placed\ninto his room at 2:19pm. Youth A did not receive medical care for\nover two hours, although he was punched, choked, and thrown by\nStaff 1. A referral was not completed as Nurse 1 did not have one\nin her system, but a medical assessment was completed at 4:30.\nConclusion Violation Established\n9",

Staff 6 reported that Youth B takes other\npeople’s youth food, pushes them out of their chairs, etc. Staff 6\nreported they (staff) monitor the unit on cameras, and they now\npass out of the food instead of youth passing to each other. Staff 6\nreported those are the interventions in place at this time.\nStaff 2:\nStaff 2 reported that Youth A is easily influenced, and that other\nyouth can tell him what to do and he will do it. Staff 2 reported that\nYouth A has spit on other staff and punched other staff because\nother youth have physically threatened him if he didn’t do it.\nStaff 2 reported that Youth A was being threatened by other\npeers. Staff 2 reported that Youth A would give his snacks and his\nfood to Youth B, noting she has seen it. Staff 2 reported that she\nhas seen Youth A receive his snacks and tray of food and walk\nover to Youth B and give him all his food. Staff 2 reported that she\nhas gone over and taken the food back and given it back to Youth\nA. Staff 2 reported that the staff have discussed that Youth A is\nbeing bullied but no one has told them what to do to problem solve\nthis. Staff 2 reported they have not been given any treatment\ninterventions to stop this behavior. Staff 2 reported she is unsure\nhow long the bullying has been going on. Staff 2 reported she did\nsee Staff 1 take Youth A for 1 on 1 time to remove Youth A from\npossible bullying.\nStaff 3:\nStaff 3 reported he was not aware of any bullying occurring with\nYouth A. Staff 3 reported there “is always something going on in\nthat unit.” Staff 3 reported about two weeks ago he heard about\nthe “contract” in one of his agency trainings. Staff 3 reported he\n10",
    "does not go to team meetings. Staff 3 reported there are only\nmeetings concerning policy changes.\nTherapist 1:\nTherapist 1 reported she was not aware that Youth A was being\nbullied. Therapist 1 reported that she never had any therapy\nsessions with Youth A concerning bullying. Therapist 1 reported\nthat she did a group meeting with all the youth to discuss bullying\nbecause it was a “pod issue.” Therapist 1 reported no other details\nas to why she knew this or what triggered her to complete a\nsession for bullying with the whole group other than it was a pod\nissue. On 11/6/23, this consultant sent an email to Therapist 1\nasking for clarification on whether she attended team meetings\nwith staff on Thursdays.\nTherapist 1 reported via email on 11/6/23, “During the month of\nAugust and September, team meetings did not take place on\nThursdays due to lack of treatment staff.

Supervisor 1 reported that about\ntwo-three months ago Youth A and Youth B were in a fight. After\nthis fight, Supervisor 2 found a paper “contract” in Youth B’s room\nwith Youth A’s name on it. The “contract” stated that Youth A\ncould join the “graveyard” gang if he would perform tasks for him\nor do things to staff when he asked. The “contract” went on to say\n11",
    "that Youth A would give Youth B his snacks and food. The\ncontract was good for 30 days and that Youth B would assess if\nhe could be a part of this gang.

The system is also to be reviewed annually\nand staff and youth shall be provided opportunity to provide input\ninto the proper application of this process.\nI reviewed the Discipline policy:\nMisdemeanor Rule Violations are listed as: Gang activity,\ncontinued negative behaviors, trading of any item threatening the\nsafety of others, intimidating, or bullying, encouraging\ninappropriate behavior in others.\nStaff will select one or two consequences to help youth:\n• A loss of free time recreation privileges for 3 days\n• A loss of merit store purchases for 3 days\n• Assignment to thinking table for three days complete an\nadditional rational thinking reports\n• Cleanup duties for 3 days\n• Return to level one merit system privileges for 5 days.\n• Restitution to the person wronged or restorative justice\nproject for the community (pod)\nAnalysis The agency did not provide positive intervention strategies to staff\nto secure safety and provide individual treatment to youth outlined\nin the Program Statement and Behavior Management and\nDiscipline Policy.\n• Supervisor 1 reported he was aware of the bullying after\nthe incident between Youth A and Youth B on 7/13/23.\nSupervisor 2 provided Supervisor 1 with a “contract” laying\nout how to be in the “graveyard” gang from Youth B to\nYouth A and Youth D.\n14",
    "• Supervisor 1 reported this contract was then given to\nTherapist 1.\n• Therapist 1 noted she was unaware of specific bullying in\nthe pod yet wrote about bullying in her court report for\nYouth B dated 7/31/23. Team meeting agendas noted\nTherapist 1 in the meetings and “bullying” discussed.\n• Team meeting agendas were provided noting bullying was\nan ongoing issue. Therapist 1 reported she did not attend\nteam meetings but met in the control room and debriefed\nwith Supervisor 2 and other staff.\n• Supervisor 1, Staff 2, Staff 6, Supervisor 2, Therapist 1\nwhere all aware bullying was occurring on the unit.\n• Staff 3 and Staff 4 were unaware of the bullying going on in\nthe unit.\n• Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, and Staff 6 all reported\nthere were no interventions discussed in team meetings\nabout how to handle bullying.\n• Administrator 1 was unaware of the “graveyard” gang or\nbullying in the unit.\nBased on interviews and documents, there is a lack of\ncommunication amongst the treatment team, supervisors and\nadministration and a lack of treatment planning. Team meetings\ndo not include intervention strategies or staff involvement. Team\nmeeting agendas are written with non-specific plans and appear to\nnot be formal meetings. There appears to be a lack of\naccountability and cohesion. Supervisor 1 was aware of the\nbullying in July 2023 and reported this to Therapist 1, who wrote\nabout it in a court report. Supervisor 2 was aware of the bullying\ndue to being in team meetings and documenting it. Staff working\non the unit are aware of bullying but not aware of interventions to\nuse. Staff all report they are not discussing bullying in team\nmeetings, yet from the team meeting agendas, there are few to no\nstaff in the meetings.\nConsultation: Team meeting agendas do not have signatures or\nclinical oversight to ensure treatment module is being followed.\nOversight is warranted due to lack of staff involvement and\nprogramming/clinical interventions. It would benefit the units if the\nteam meeting agendas coincided with their therapeutic design,\noutlining group interventions for stage of development as well as\nindividual interventions for individual growth. It would also benefit\nthe agency if staff were present in the team meetings.\nConclusion Violation Established\n15",
