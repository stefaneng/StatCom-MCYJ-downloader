The agency's corrective action\nplan which indicated it would create a spreadsheet related to service plan due\ndates, and after discharge youth follow ups was implemented and completed. Its\ntracking methods of sending workers email and calendar reminders related to\nthese tasks, and an initial meeting with staff in November 2023 was also\nimplemented and completed.

The agency\nreported it has worked diligently with its case managers on its Interim Corrective\nAction Plan.

All staff reported the agency is continuing to\nprovide active services to youths and to see favorable outcomes. The two case\nmanagers reported feeling the chief administrator and program manager are doing\na good job. Additionally, they felt supported by these administrators and their co-\nworkers. They believed the program empowers youths to achieve and aids them in\nobtaining life skills, as well as personal identification documents. Areas for growth\nreported were for continued improved communication between staff to staff and\nstaff to youth, with focus on ensuring what is written down is passed on to all.\nAlso, for all staff to hold youths accountable for their actions initially and\nconsistently.\nAlthough youth interviews are not required, it was an expectation by the agency,\nand two youths were interviewed. Both youths reported positives about the\nprogram and the staff. The one area of growth reported was for the house's\nenvironment to be updated.",
