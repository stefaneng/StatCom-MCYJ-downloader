    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff Qualifications; volunteer, contractors\nSection on central registry.\nDescription (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nsuitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster care worker engaged in inappropriate interactions with\nfoster child and relative caregiver, including verbal harassment\nand putting their hand in child's shirt.\nInvestigation Complainant reported concerns to DCWL on 1/12/24,\nsummarized as follows:\n• Foster Care Worker allowed child’s mom to follow Relative\nCaregiver to the car after a visit. Mom put her hand down\nthe child’s shirt and tried to take a picture.\n• Foster Care Worker went to Relative Caregiver’s home on\nanother date and also put her hands down the child’s shirt.\n• The agency is harassing the child and Relative Caregiver.\nRelative Caregiver was contacted via email on 1/12/24.\nRelative Caregiver(RC) reported after a parenting time visit at the\nagency the child’s mother followed them out to the car. RC stated\nthere is a court order that the mother is not supposed to do that.\nWhile at the car, the mother looked in the child’s shirt. The child is\n5 years old. RC was asked if the mother was looking at a bruise or\nmark, or something the child asked her to look at. RC stated there\nwas no reason to look in the child’s shirt. RC stated that after the\nvisit, Foster Care Worker (FCW) called RC back to the agency to\ngive the child a birthday gift. While there, FCW put her hand down\nthe child’s shirt. FCW did not indicate why she did this. However,\nFCW stated she did not see anything except possibly a rash. At a\nlater date, during a visit at RC’s house, FCW was asked why she\nlooked down the child’s shirt. FCW denied this occurred and\ncalled the child a liar. RC was asked if they could clarify how they\nfelt the agency was “harassing” them. RC clarified that the child’s\nmother harasses them by making statements about returning\nhome, which scares the child. RC reported informing FCW,\nSupervisor, Agency Director, and a lawyer of these concerns. The\nagency put steps in place regarding contact between RC and the\nmother. RC did not report any ways they felt the agency harassed\nthem.\n2",
    "Agency Director was interviewed via TEAMS on 1/25/24.\nAgency Director reported she had several phone calls with RC.\nRC and the child’s mother have a difficult relationship and RC\ncomplains frequently about things that he disagrees with in the\ncase. Agency Director reported they attempt to discuss these\nconcerns and problem solve with RC. However, RC has not been\nvery receptive. Agency Director stated they continue to service the\ncase with the children’s best interest in mind and address RC’s\nconcerns as they are able. Agency Director denied any prior\ncomplaints from RC about the mother or worker putting her hand\ndown the child’s shirt.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via TEAMS on 1/25/24.\nProgram Manager reported they were aware of RC’s frustration\nwith the case. A Family Team Meeting (FTM) was held on 1/17/24\nto discuss and develop solutions. RC attended the meeting and\nstated the things he was dissatisfied with. However, he did not\nseem willing to talk about ways to resolve the concerns.\nProgram Manager reported RC and the child’s mother have had a\nchallenging relationship, which seems to be where much of his\nfrustration stems from. Program Manager also reported that there\nhave been challenges with RC as a placement. For the first half of\nthe 2023-2024 school year the child had 29 school absences and\nseveral tardies, the child is not attending therapy as required, and\nRC has been late to parenting time in addition to interacting\nnegatively with the mother in front of the children. These issues\nwere discussed with RC at the FTM. Program Manager believed\nthis information was relevant to the investigation as there seems\nto be a pattern of RC making allegations about the agency, when\nhe is held accountable by the agency about following the child’s\ntreatment plan. Regarding anyone looking in or putting their hand\nin the child’s shirt, Program Manager did not have any first-hand\nknowledge of any situation where this occurred. However, she did\nrecall Children’s Services being called due to some marks on the\nchild’s chest several months ago. Program Manager denied any\nprior complaints from RC about the mother or worker putting her\nhand down the child’s shirt. Program Manager stated she was not\naware of any court order to prevent the child’s mom from speaking\nwith relative or approaching them outside of the agency.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via phone on 1/29/24.\nFCW stated there are no court orders in place to prevent the\nchild’s mother from walking out to the car or interacting with RC.\nHowever, due to RC being negative towards the mother in front of\nthe children, someone from the agency walks the children out to\nRC’s car, while the mother waits inside the agency. This plan has\n3",
    "been in place for several months. FCW has not observed the\nchild’s mother following RC out to the car recently. There was one\ntime in October 2023 that the diaper bag was left in the visit room\nand the mother ran it out to RC’s car. FCW did not observe any\nproblems between RC and the mother at that time. Regarding\nFCW or the mother looking down the child’s shirt, FCW recalled\nthat in July 2023 the child reported some scratches on her chest\nduring parenting time. The scratches were at the neckline of the\nchild’s shirt. The mother was able to view the scratches without\nmoving the child’s shirt. RC was not present when this occurred\nduring parenting time. The mother asked FCW to look at the\nscratches. When the visit ended FCW walked the child out to RC’s\ncar. Child got in the car and FCW was able to view the marks at\nthe child’s neckline. FCW denied ever looking down the child’s\nshirt or putting her hand down the child’s shirt. FCW described the\nmarks to appear to be skin irritation, not scratches. An\ninvestigation later determined the irritation was due to the child\nfalling off of her scooter a few days prior to the visit. A safety plan\nwas developed regarding supervision of the child at RC’s home.\nThe safety plan was reviewed at RC’s home a few days later.\nDuring that home visit, RC began making negative, untrue\nstatements about the child’s mother. FCW discussed with RC that\nthe child may be sharing some inaccurate information, which is\ncausing tension between RC and the mother. FCW denied ever\ncalling the child a liar but did state the child seemed to be\nmanipulating the situation and triangulating with her mother and\nRC. Regarding RC stating that his concerns have not been\naddressed, FCW said this is untrue. There have been several\nphone calls, emails, and meetings to discuss his concerns. FCW\nreported RC’s concerns seem to increase whenever the agency\ndiscusses RC not following the treatment plan. FCW relayed the\nsame placement concerns as Program Manager and indicated the\nagency continues to address this.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via phone on 1/29/24.\nSupervisor reported she was not aware of any court orders\nindicating the child’s mother could not go out to the car or interact\nwith RC. Supervisor stated she was not present for or heard of an\nallegation about any incident where the child’s mother or FCW\nlooked in or put their hand in the child’s shirt. Supervisor recalled\nhearing about the child having some scratches on her chest and\nchildren’s services being contacted. Supervisor stated RC\npreviously mentioned FCW looked at the marks on the child, but\nnever indicated FCW looked down her shirt or acted\ninappropriately. During a recent FTM RC brought up the issue of\nFCW calling the child a liar. This was the first time Supervisor\n4",
    "heard this allegation. Supervisor had never witnessed FCW call\nthe child a liar. Supervisor stated that she had many\nconversations with RC. When he is dissatisfied with Supervisors\nresponses, RC has a habit of bypassing the Program Manager\nand speaking directly with the Agency Director. RC repeatedly\nreports the same information about being upset with the mother\nand feeling the agency should not work toward reunification.\nSupervisor reported explaining how the foster care system works,\nseveral times. RC’s complaints seem to be more frequent when\nthe agency addresses concerns about the child’s placement with\nRC. When the agency attempts to discuss what needs to be done\nto follow the service plan, RC deflects and makes complaints\nabout the child’s mother. Supervisor reported there have been\nthree FTMs to discuss the concerns about school absences and\ntherapy attendance. As these issues have not improved,\nalternative placements may need to be considered.\nDocuments reviewed\nMiSACWIS file review:\n• A review of FTMs determined there was no documentation\nthat RC reported a concern about the mother or FCW\nlooking down or putting their hand down the child’s shirt.\n• A review of court orders determined there are no court\norders preventing the mother from interacting with RC or\nwalking her children out of parenting time to RC’s car.\n• A review of case contacts determined there were no\ndocumented reports from RC about the mother or FCW\nputting their hand down the child’s shirt.\n• A case contact from 7/26/23 reported that during parenting\ntime the child asked her mother to look at her chest. Some\nred scratches were observed. After the visit FCW walked\nchild to RC’s car and looked at the scratches. An incident\nreport was completed and children’s services was\ncontacted.\n• Children’s Services allegation intake dated 7/26/23\nindicated that during parenting time the child was observed\nwith red scratches on her chest. The allegation was\ntransferred to the agency for review. As RC is not a\nlicensed foster parent, a special evaluation was not\ncompleted. But additional contacts were entered. RC\nreported to the agency that the marks were from the child\nfalling off her scooter. A safety plan was developed and\ndiscussed with RC. RC did not report any concerns at that\ntime about the mother or FCW looking at the child’s chest.\n5",
    "Analysis Based on the information obtained through interviews and\ndocument review, no information was found to confirm this\nallegation.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12210 Grievance handling\nSection (1) An agency shall have a written grievance handling\nDescription procedure as mandated by section 8a of the foster care\nand adoption services act, 1994 PA 203, MCL\n722.958a, and known as the 'foster parent's bill of rights\nlaw.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not respond to a grievance filed by the relative\ncaregiver.\nInvestigation Relative Caregiver was contacted via email on 1/12/24.\nRelative Caregiver was asked for clarification regarding the\nallegation. On 1/14/24 Relative Caregiver clarified they did not file\na grievance with the agency.\nAgency Director was interviewed via TEAMS on 1/25/24.\nAgency Director confirmed a grievance was not filed by Relative\nCaregiver. Agency Director agreed to provide RC with information\nabout how to file a grievance if he wished to do so.\nAnalysis As a grievance was not filed, no violation was found.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.
