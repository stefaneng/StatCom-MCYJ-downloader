DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThe Wedgwood East Campus Building is a newly constructed two story, 56-bed facility. It\nreplaces the Wedgwood Cutlerville Campus building that was quickly falling into disrepair and\nalso posed numerous supervision challenges because of the layout of the living units in an\nold hospital ward. The old facility also lacked sufficient lounge and recreation areas to\naccommodate the needs of programs operating at capacity.\nThe Crossroads Program [CI410201082], the Summit Program [CI410201502], and the\nPathfinder-Delta Program [CI410201359] are moving from the Cutlerville Campus to the new\nWedgwood East Campus. They will maintain their program names, but be incorporated into\none license. The Pathfinder Program [Formerly male residents] and the Delta Program\n[Formerly female residents] will occupy the 28 bed co-ed living unit on the 2nd floor. This living\nunit has two female bedroom hallways and two male bedroom hallways. Most bedrooms are\nsingles, but there is a three-bed, male bedroom and a three-bed, female bedroom. The living\narea is a very large room and includes a kitchen area. There are no blind spots or areas that\nwould be difficult to supervise. The entire program is monitored by cameras with the wiring in\nplace to upgrade to sound monitoring. All bedroom doors are alarmed to insure that residents\ncannot leave their rooms without staff knowledge. Because there is no staff office, staff\noperate from a counter in the center of the living area. From the counter the staff are able to\nsee down all four bedroom hallways as well as being able to supervise the entire daytime\nliving area without blind spots. There are two secure classrooms on the second floor that will\nbe operated by Kentwood Public Schools.\nThe first floor is divided into two living units. To the left of the front door is the 16 bed\nCrossroads Program, a non-secure, male adolescent sexual offender treatment program. It\nhas two, three-bed bedrooms and ten single bedrooms. The design of the program is similar\nto the upstairs layout with cameras, high resident visibility in a large dayroom, no staff office,\nand secure classrooms. To the left is the second living unit. It is the secure, co-ed Summit\nProgram for the treatment of substance dependent and addicted teens. The layout of this\n2",
    "program is a mirror of the Crossroads Program, except that it has one, three bed bedroom\nand eleven single bedrooms.\nAll of the programs have numerous large windows that look out over large open areas. All\nfurniture is new and there is more than sufficient space for residents to maintain separate\nactivities.\nIn addition to the new residence building, Wedgwood has added a bistro club operated by the\nchaplaincy and a resident and staff health club. The grounds have been expanded to include\na fenced pond, benches, and paved walking trail. Driveways and parking areas have been\nsignificantly reduced in areas near the residential buildings.\nB. Program Description\nAll four programs have moved from the Cutlerville Campus to the East Campus without\nchanges to programming or policy.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nNONE\nThe facility has been given approval for occupancy by Duane Dimet of the Bureau of Fire\nServices. Additional temporary restrictions on the occupancy include:\na. No storage in the any of the four storage rooms / janitors rooms since they do not have\nthe B-labeled fire doors.\nb. No use of the behavioral management room that is missing the glass in the door\nc. One phone in each of the four pods must be working before occupancy. At the time of\nthe fire inspection, three pods had not yet been wired for phone service.\nd. There must be a policy / procedure in place to keep all of the exits shoveled.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that a new program, provisional license be issued to this newly\nconstructed, child caring institution.\n12/29/2008\nSteve Ragsdale Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n12/29/2008\nLinda Lee for Deborah Clark Date\nArea Manager\n3",
