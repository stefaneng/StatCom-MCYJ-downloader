Overall, the agency did very well with\nviolations for this review.\nVII. DCWL FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS:\nConcerns:\nA visit was conducted at the home of foster parent, the caregiver of the foster child. The\nfoster parent and her son lives in a one-bedroom home next door to her parents in\nWayne, MI. Her parents live on Merriman Rd., Wayne, MI. According to the foster\nparent and foster child, the foster child sleeps next door at the foster parent’s parents\nhome; due to the foster parent having a one-bedroom home. The foster parent stated\nthe agency is aware of the sleeping arrangements and the foster care worker completed\ncriminal background checks on all household members. Information regarding the foster\nchild not sleeping at the foster parent's home, a home study for the parents home and\ncriminal background and central registry checks couldn’t be verified in MiSACWIS. The\nfoster parent also stated she was informed that the foster child could not be placed in\nher parents home as a fictive kin placement. There are three adult household members\nthat reside at the home of the foster parent’s parents home.\nThe following safety issues must be verified:\n- Criminal background and central registry checks must be done on the three adult\nmembers of the house hold and:\n- A home study to verify safety of the home should be done at the home located on\nMerriman Road, Wayne, MI.\nSolution:\nThe ICHATs and criminal record checks were completed but not uploaded in\nMISACWIS. ICHATS have been uploaded in the provider documents section.\nThe fictive kin is not willing to do a home study at this time. In order to address this\nissue timely, the agency has completed a safety plan that the youth will not spend the\nnight in the home until a home study is completed. This safety plan was signed and\nuploaded in the foster care MiSACWIS general documents hyperlink.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend that Ennis for Children - Pontiac will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\n6",
