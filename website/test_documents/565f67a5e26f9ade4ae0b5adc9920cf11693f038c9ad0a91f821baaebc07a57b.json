    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period. Compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The CAP,\napproved 11/1/22, was a result of the 10/21/22 interim review. The CAP was due\nto a citation of rule 327, special investigations. The agency implemented their CAP\nshortly after approval. The agency then chose to remove foster care and foster\nhome licensing from their license types, and only provide adoption services at this\ntime.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed on-site. The\nChief Administrator reported they have not encountered any staffing concerns this\nyear. The agency chose to stop providing foster care and foster home licensing\nservices and focused on adoption only. Overall, the adoption program is running\nsmoothly and only had three placement disruptions. The CA reported the\ndisruptions were similar in that they involved older youth, who had a lengthy\nhistory of residential placement prior to adoptive placement. The agency reported\nthey believe additional trauma related training would be beneficial to families\nconsidering a youth transitioning from residential to an adoptive home. In addition,\nthey believe the agency with the child's case responsibility could provide useful\ntraining to potential adoptive parents, about the specific issues related to the\nchild's trauma history and transitioning to an adoptive home.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nOne adoption worker was interviewed. The adoption worker reported enjoying her\njob and having a great relationship with her supervisor. She stated she can go to\nher supervisor with any questions or concerns and feels respected. She reported\nhaving no concerns or suggestions for improvement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2022 review. The\noffice continues to have adequate space for staff and clients, and sufficient\nstorage for confidential information.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNot applicable- This program is adoption only.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n_ ____________October 18, 2023________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 24, 2023\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager"
