    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Consultation was not requested.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe agency had one CAP (approved 6/15/2022) as a result of the 6/6/2022 interim\nreview. During that review 10 violations were found. The agency reported\nsuccessful implementation of their CAP. However, noted having difficulty with\ntimeliness of adoption assessments, medical passports, and treatment plan\nsignatures. This information is consistent with what was found in the current\nreview. However, it was noted there has been improvement in these areas, and\noverall less violations than the prior year.\nThe agency had one CAP (approved 6/29/22) as a result of the 6/7/22 special\nevaluation in which it was alleged the agency did not include parents in\nmedical/dental treatment and decision making for their children in care. A violation\nof FOM 801 Health Services For Children In Foster Care, was found. As of this\nreview, there have been no additional concerns. No additional violations of this\npolicy were found during this renewal review. Therefore, it is determined the\nagency is in compliance at this time.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) was reviewed and discussed on-site.\nThe CAA reported successful implementation of the CAP with ongoing efforts to\nimprove several identified areas. The agency reported continued difficulty in\ncompleting and uploading timely 1105 reports for Family Team Meetings and\nobtaining Treatment Plan signatures. The CAA also identified a trend of ongoing\nproblems with placement disruption and locating new placements for teens. This is\na known, statewide issue.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\nStaff and Youth Interviews",
    "Three staff were interviewed on-site. Staff reported feeling appreciated and\nsupported by their agency. Overall, staff stated that the administrator and\nsupervisors are organized, knowledgeable, and help keep things running\nsmoothly. There were no suggestions by staff about improvements needed at the\nagency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is located in an office building in a heavily populated area. The office\nhas locking storage for files and adequate space for staff. The agency also has\nsufficient space for clients to meet with staff or have family visits.\nVII. ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n___________April 12, 2023__________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 12, 2023\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
