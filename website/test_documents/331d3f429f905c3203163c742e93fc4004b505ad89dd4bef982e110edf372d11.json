The facility was\nplaced on a first provisional license during this period under review on November 1,\n2021. The facility has submitted six acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment, all of which were for violations prior to the current provisional license\nperiod. One corrective action plan was in response to the interim report and five\ncorrective action plans were in response to special investigations resulting in the\nprovisional license. The facility has not had any special investigations since\nSeptember 8, 2021.\nThe corrective action plans that are currently being monitored are reviewed at least\nquarterly. The main components of these corrective action plans include:\n Updating the staffing model to clearly outline staff schedule, ensuring a veteran\nstaff is on shift at all times, not including the program supervisor to count in ratio,\noutlining the on-call schedule, having a program supervisor on shift between 7am\nand 11pm to provide supervision and mentoring, and ensuring the deputy\ndirector is notified when there is a staffing issue.\n To address staff deficiencies program supervisors have increased mentoring,\nhave increased observation, are providing monthly written feedback for staff,\nmonthly supervision sessions, training, and evaluations. Program supervisors are\nproviding this information to the deputy director for review and additional\nfeedback as needed.\n Developing a new hiring process to ensure all staff meet the educational\nrequirements of the position hired for. This new process includes the Chief\nAdministrator and Deputy Director reviewing and approving the employee files\nbefore positions are offered to verify compliance.\n Facility distribution, implementation, and training of all corrective action plans to\nensure that all staff are aware and following required action steps. Additionally,\nthe process for oversite of all corrective action plans implementation and\ncompliance was changed to completing internal correct action plan reviews, team\nmeetings, individual and group supervision, and administrative meetings.\n Developing a new process on notification requirements to DCWL to ensure\ncompliance with the rules. The new process included additional oversight by\ndeputy director to ensure the notifications are being completed as required.\n7",
    " The facility has a financial corrective action plan to combine two programs\n(Teaching Family Homes and Associated Family Care) into one financial account\nto provide additional financial stability and flexibility. The facility obtained loan\nforgiveness for two large loans and has obtained a new annual audit.\n Not combining youth from Indian River and South Bluff due to staffing shortages,\nretraining all staff on supervision expectations, monthly team reviews of\nsupervision policy. Additionally, they have action steps to ensure safety plan\nimplementation and monitoring. All safety plans are reviewed by program\nsupervisors, hung on the wall in the staff office, reviewed in team meeting, and\nreviewed and signed by all staff.\nThe facility had four repeat violations:\n R. 400.4114 Tuberculosis screening for employees and volunteers. Previously\nthe facility had 5 of 6 employees that did not meet the requirements and during\nthis period under review had 1 of 14 employees that did not meet the\nrequirements.\n R. 400.4113 (j) Employee records/Evaluations. Previously the facility had 3 of\n6 employees that did not meet the requirements and during this period under\nreview had 2 of 10 employees that did not meet the requirements.\n R. 400.4113 (f) Employee records/Criminal Background Clearances.\nPreviously the facility had 1 of 3 employees that did not meet the requirements\nand during this period under review had 2 of 10 that did not meet the\nrequirements.\n R. 400.4113 (i) Employee records/Central Registry Clearances. Previously the\nfacility had 1 of 3 employees that did not meet the requirements and during\nthis period under review had 2 of 10 that did not meet the requirements.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nDuring this period under review the facility has changed Chief Administrators and\nadded a new Executive Director and there is a notable improvement in oversight, and\naccountability which has decreased special investigations. There have been monthly\non-sight visits to the facility since October 2021. During these visits interviews were\ncompleted with youth and staff. Youth consistently report feeling safe, having all their\nbasic needs met, and having appropriate therapy and programming to work on\ntreatment goals. The staff have all consistently reported that the change in Chief\nAdministrator and Executive Director has created a better work environment where\nthey feel supported and have consistency and direction. The staff report the\nprogramming and overall safety for both youth and staff has greatly improved.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment documents the facility’s action steps to come into compliance and\nmaintain compliance with prior violations. The Chief Administrator notes the abrupt\nchange at the facility with the prior Chief Administrator leaving without notice and the\nfacility being without an administrator for a portion of the period under review. The\n8",
    "Chief Administrator outlines his current plan as administrator, which includes working\nclosely with executive director, program supervisors, social service worker, training\ncoordinator, recreation and nutrition coordinator, human recourse coordinator, and\nprogram/administrative support to ensure the agency remains in compliance with the\ncurrent corrective action plans and contracts. In addition, Chief Administrator plans to\nreview all resident’s files 30 day from admission and annually thereafter for\ncompliance. As well as continuously work with the human resource coordinator to\nensure employee files are reviewed within 30 days of hire and annually thereafter.\nInterviews\nThe staff interviewed all reported a feeling of support from administration. The staff\nwere able to speak to the current corrective action plans and compliance with the\naction steps. The staff did not have any concerns about the facility or the safety for\nthemselves or the youth at the facility. The youth interviewed all reported feeling safe\nat South Bluff. The youth all stated the staff were respectful and assisted them with\ntheir treatment goals. The youth did not report any concerns about the facility.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility’s license be renewed to a regular license.\n_____________________________________April 5, 2022___\nStephanie Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 6, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n9"
