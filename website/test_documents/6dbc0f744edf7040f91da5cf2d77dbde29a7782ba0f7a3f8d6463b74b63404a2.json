    "10/21/2020 Contact – Telephone call made\nInterview with Foster Care Worker.\n10/27/2020 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION:\nResident was brought to ER by police after she attempted to run in traffic. Since\nresident is a minor, a guardian must be present while in the ER. Agency staff was\naware, but they were unable to stay with resident in the ER until placement could be\nsecured.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was transferred from Centralized Intake to the Division of Child\nWelfare Licensing for investigation. The complaint noted the following,\nYouth A (14) is a foster youth. The Foster Care Worker is a foster care case\nmanager from Family Service and Children's Aid in Jackson County. Youth A\nwas placed from Henry Ford Allegiance (Jackson) to Glens House crisis\nresidential (Kalamazoo) on Friday 8/21/20. On 8/22/20, Youth A eloped from\nGlens House and was brought to the ER by police after she attempted to run in\ntraffic. The Foster Care Worker did briefly come to the ER, but left yesterday\naround 6 PM. She was told that since the patient is a minor, a guardian must be\npresent throughout her stay in the ER. The Foster Care Worker acknowledged\nthat, but stated their agency is not equipped to staff someone in an ER 24/7. She\ndid offer that the on-call foster care worker would be available at any time to\nreturn to sign paperwork, etc. The Foster Care Worker stated that she or her\nsupervisor had reached out to Jackson Co. CPS in regard to getting someone\nhere with the patient, but still today no one is here with this minor. The foster care\nagency is aware that Youth A is not safe to leave the ER, but they are unable to\nstay with Youth A in the ER until placement can by secured.\nThe complainant was not available, however, complainant 2 was familiar with this\ncase and was able to verify information. Complainant 2 was then interviewed via\nphone on 08/24/20 and confirmed the information in the allegations. The\ncomplainant reported that the agency staff was there at the time of the call on\n08/24/20 and had been there since the night before.\nI interviewed the Supervisor, Director, and Chief Administrator via phone conference\non 08/26/20. The Foster Care Worker was on unrelated planned leave during this\ntime. The Supervisor reported that Youth A was placed at the hospital on 08/22/20\nand the Foster Care Worker was present at the hospital. While at the hospital, Youth\nA was destructive at the hospital (destroyed property and broke a corner molding off\nand was hitting herself with it) and exhibiting self-harm. The hospital staff then\nchemically restrained Youth A and put her in restraints. The Supervisor reported that\n3",
    "the Foster Care Worker stayed at the hospital and sat with Youth A while she was\nasleep until she left from the hospital. The Supervisor reported that the Foster Care\nWorker left contact numbers with the hospital staff in case they needed to reach\nsomeone. During the time after the Foster Care Worker left the hospital on the\nevening of 08/22/20, until approximately 8:30pm on 08/23/20, the Supervisor\nreported that she was in contact with the hospital and also spoke with Youth A and\nno one from the hospital told her that a staff was needed at the hospital. Per the\nSupervisor, Chief Administrator, and Director, the Supervisor went up to the hospital\nat about 10:30pm on 08/23/20 and there has been staff there since that time. The\nChief Administrator reported frustration with the hospital staff for their lack of\ncommunication on this.\nI interviewed the Foster Care Worker via phone on 10/21/20. The Foster Care\nWorker reviewed this incident and reported that Youth A was at the hospital and the\nFoster Care Worker was present. Per the Foster Care Worker, Youth A was\nchemically restrained to keep her calm and was in a locked room for security and\nsafety after she was acting out and self-harming at the hospital. The Foster Care\nWorker noted that Youth A was sleeping, and the Foster Care Worker attempted to\nspeak with the hospital social worker who was unavailable for a long period. The\nFoster Care Worker reported that she provided the hospital social worker phone\nnumbers for the on-call worker and the Supervisor and then left the hospital. This\nwas after Youth A was sleeping and the hospital social worker confirmed there were\nno forms to be signed. The Foster Care Worker confirmed that the hospital staff told\nher that a staff from the agency needed to be at the hospital with Youth A, but the\nFoster Care Worker told the hospital that the agency did not have the staff to provide\n24/7 staffing. The Foster Care Worker said that she did not know what transpired\nafter that as she was on a planned leave.\nDocumentation reviewed is as follows with applicable information noted:\n MiSACWIS case information inclusive of social work contacts\n Emergency staff coverage for Youth A at the hospital provided by the\nSupervisor\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children, their\nfamilies, and other relevant individuals and be primarily\nresponsible for the development, implementation, and review of\nservice plans for the children and their families.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency is in violation of the rule as the Foster Care Worker\nleft Youth A at the hospital without staff supervision after being\ndirectly told by the hospital that an agency staff was required to\nbe there. The youth was not admitted to the hospital at that time,\nand this did not demonstrate sufficient supervision or\ncollaboration with other individuals involved with the child’s\ncase.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings in this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the agency submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nOctober 22, 2020\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 26, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
