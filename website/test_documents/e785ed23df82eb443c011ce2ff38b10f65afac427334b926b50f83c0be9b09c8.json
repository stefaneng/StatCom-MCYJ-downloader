The staff member appeared\nagitated.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/25/25.\nYouth A reported he was in the cafeteria, but he couldn’t\nremember why. Youth A reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 were in the\ncafeteria with him. Youth A reported Staff 2 poked him in the eye\nwhen they were in the cafeteria. Youth A reported he pulled Staff\n2’s hair 5 different times and Staff 1 helped release his hands from\nStaff 2’s hair. Youth A reported one time, Staff 2 grabbed his hair\nand Staff 1 pushed Staff 2 off to get her to stop. Youth A did not\nwant to be asked any other questions and ended the interview\nquickly.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/25/25.\nStaff 1 reported as soon as she and Staff 2 brought Youth A into\nthe cafeteria, Youth A immediately began running and going after\nStaff 2. Staff 1 reported Youth A began pulling Staff 2’s hair, so\nStaff 1 completed an approved grip release. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A began slamming his body into the cafeteria door trying to\nget it open. Staff 1 reported she was trying to verbally de-escalate\nYouth A by talking to him and offering him different options. Youth\nA began running and punching at things in the cafeteria. Staff 1\nreported at one point, he went to punch Staff 2, Staff 2 blocked\nYouth A’s punch. Staff 1 reported after the block, Youth A flung his\nhand backwards and began screaming about his eye.

    "acknowledge it at all. Staff 1 reported she did an approved grip\nrelease to get Staff 2’s hand off Youth A’s hair, and Staff 1 didn’t\nacknowledge the grip release either.

Staff 1\nreported she was fine with Youth A, so she did not swap out. Staff\n1 reported Staff 2 refused to swap out and stated she didn’t need\nto.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/25/25.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A grabbed her hair several times while they\nwere in the cafeteria, so she had to grab her hair at a higher point\nto prevent him from pulling (i.e. he was pulling the ends of her\nhair, and she was grabbing the hair closer to her roots to prevent\nhim from pulling it). Staff 2 reported she never grabbed Youth A’s\nhair because he has no hair to grab. Staff 2 reported the only thing\nshe grabbed the whole time was his legs, which was to help Staff\n1 out when Staff 1 had Youth A in a restraint. Staff 2 reported\nYouth A was flailing his legs everywhere and Staff 1 was having a\nhard time keeping a hold of him. Staff 2 couldn’t remember what\nYouth A or Staff 1’s body positions were during the restraint. Staff\n2 reported at one point, Youth A tried to punch her, and when she\nblocked him, the back of her hand slid down his face.

Staff 4 reported she\n3",
    "opened the cafeteria to check on Staff 1, Staff 2 and Youth A.\nStaff 4 reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 were starting an approved PRT\nrestraint on Youth A with Youth A sitting on the ground. Staff 4\nreported Staff 2 was trying to get behind Youth A in the PRT\nposition and Staff 1 was holding Youth A’s legs. Staff 4 reported\nYouth A was trying to grab Staff 2’s hair. Staff 4 reported Youth A\nwas trying to rotate his body, so Staff 4 reminded Staff 1 and Staff\n2 they could not restrain Youth A if he turned onto his stomach.\nStaff 4 reported Youth B began yelling and getting frustrated, so\nshe shut the cafeteria door so she could focus on calming Youth B\ndown.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 4/30/25. Staff 5 reported\nwhenever Youth A is in the cafeteria, he always screams. Staff 5\nreported hearing Youth A screaming, so she went to check on\nhim, Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 5 reported she saw Youth A was just\nscreaming, and nothing else was happening, so she shut the door.\nStaff 5 reported hearing Youth A screaming again, so she opened\nthe door again.

Staff 5\nreported Staff 1 was trying to restrain Youth A as Staff 2 was\ntrying to do the grip release. Staff 5 reported Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere doing the grip release and restraint appropriately.

Staff 5 reported she\nasked Staff 2 if she wanted to swap out, but Staff 2 refused. Staff\n5 reported Youth A said his eyes were burning, so Staff 1 asked\nStaff 2 to grab a wet washcloth and a glass of water. Staff 5\nreported she wiped Youth A’s eyes and face with the wet towel,\nand then she left after he calmed down a bit. Staff 5 reported Staff\n1 and Staff 2 did nothing wrong or inappropriate while she was in\nthe cafeteria.\nSupervisor was interviewed via phone on 5/5/25. Supervisor\nreported he went into the cafeteria to check on Youth A, Staff 1\nand Staff 2. Supervisor reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 were in\nopposite spaces and were not next to Youth A when he walked in.\nSupervisor reported Staff 2 asked Supervisor to sit in the cafeteria\nfor a little bit in case something happened. Supervisor reported\nYouth A was hitting the walls and guardrail which divides the\nkitchen from the cafeteria. Supervisor reported he was in the\ncafeteria for about 5 minutes but then he left because they were\ndoing fine. Supervisor reported he did not see anything\nconcerning while he was present.\n4",
    "Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 4/25/25. CA reported Staff 2 has never been part of\nphysical management before. CA reported Staff 2 normally takes\nother youth to another room while other staff handle the crisis. CA\nreported she was in a restraint refresher training with Staff 2 and\nStaff 2 seemed hesitant. CA reported she had the restraint trainer\nmeet with Staff 2 individually to address Staff 2’s concerns so she\ncould feel more confident. CA reported after Staff 2 and the trainer\nmet, the trainer said Staff 2 was good to go.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Agency response strategy dated 4/22/25 states Staff 2 will\nbe off the schedule and away from Youth A pending\ninvestigation.\n• Discipline Policy states the facility prohibits all cruel and\nsevere discipline, including any type of corporal punishment\ninflicted in any manner.\n• Incident Report authored by Staff 1 dated 4/22/25 states\nafter entering the cafeteria, Youth A ran towards Staff 2\nwith a closed fist, and Staff 2 used HWC approved blocks.\nYouth A found some cooked carrots on the ground and\nthrew them at Staff 2. Youth A grabbed Staff 2’s hair, and\nStaff 1 completed a HWC approved grip release. Youth A\nbegan to run into the cafeteria door with his body. Youth A\nran into the door twice and then headbutted the cafeteria\ngate. Youth A ran up to Staff 2 and pulled her hair. Staff 1\ncompleted an HWC approved grip release. Staff 1 also had\nto release Staff 2’s hand from Youth A’s hair. Youth A\ngrabbed Staff 1 and Staff 2’s hair. Staff 1 did a hair release\nwhile calling for additional staff. Youth A released their hair,\nran to a table to take a seat and breathe. Staff 1 started to\ncount to ten while doing yoga stretches to help Youth A\ncalm down. Youth A took deep breaths and Staff 2 asked if\nYouth A was calm enough for a snack. Youth A ran across\nthe cafeteria with a closed fist, slipped, and punched\nhimself in the eye as he fell. Youth A got up and yelled his\neye was “burning” while he swatted at Staff 2. Staff 1 asked\nYouth A to take a seat so his eye could be looked at. Staff\n1 offered Youth A a bag of ice if he could show he could be\nsafe enough with it. Youth A began to scream, ran towards\nStaff 2 and pulled her hair again. Staff 1 completed another\ngrip release and Youth A ran to the other side of the\ncafeteria. Youth A was asked to take some deep breaths so\n5",
    "he could get a snack and a bag of ice. Youth A ran and\nstarted to hit Staff 2. Staff 1 initiated a HWC approved PRT\nand Youth A attempted to bite Staff 1 and Staff 2’s legs.\nStaff 2 held Youth A’s legs while Staff 1 held Youth A’s\narms. Staff 1 started deep breaths and quiet counting to\nhelp Youth A focus on his breathing. Youth A stated he was\nhot and sweaty and needed to take off his sweatshirt. Staff\n1 told A once he was calm, he could be released. Youth A\ncompleted deep breaths and then was released. Youth A\ntook a seat at the table while Staff 2 got Youth A a cold, wet\nwashcloth and some tissues. Staff 1 placed the washcloth\non Youth A’s eyes and grabbed him a snack. Once calm,\nhe left the cafeteria with Staff 1 and Staff 2.\n• Staff 2 does not have any disciplinary records in her\nemployee file. Staff 2 completed HWC training on 10/26/23,\n10/27/23, 4/4/24, 9/18/24, and 2/6/25.\nAnalysis The facility is found in violation as per interviews conducted, Staff\n1 and Youth A reported Staff 2 grabbed Youth A’s hair. Staff 2\nreported Youth A did not have enough hair to grab, but Consultant\ninterviewed Youth A face to face and confirmed that was untrue.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility should ensure staff are trained to swap out with other\nstaff if they are being targeted by youth. In this situation, many\noffers were made to swap out and Staff 2 refused despite being\ntargeted by Youth A repeatedly. Swapping out may have de-\nescalated the situation faster.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR#2024C0001020 approved 1/18/24; CAP approved 2/9/24\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth's behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth's\ntreatment plan.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation On 4/21/25, a youth was inappropriately escorted to a safe space\ndue to exhibiting behaviors.\n6",
    "Investigation INTERVIEWS:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/25/25.\nYouth A reported he could not remember how he got from B-side\ninto the cafeteria or why he went into the cafeteria.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/25/25.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was escalated on B-side due to a peer\nconflict. Staff 1 reported she and Staff 2 were trying to separate\nYouth A from the conflict, so they escorted Youth A to the\ncafeteria. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 had her hips on the door and\nStaff 2 was behind Youth A holding his arms as they were going\nthrough the door. Staff 1 reported she was helping with the door\nand blocking the door from Youth A’s feet. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA was resisting as they were bringing him into the cafeteria. Staff\n1 reported Youth A tried to drop weight and Staff 2 held Youth A’s\narms a little harder and tried getting him through the door. Staff 1\nreported it was an improper escort. Staff 1 reported at no point did\nshe or Staff 2 pick Youth A up off the floor to get him into the\ncafeteria.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/25/25.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A was escalated on B-side and was trying\nto throw kicks and punches towards the other kids on the unit.\nStaff 2 reported Staff 1 blocked Youth A’s punches and kicks, so\nhe did not make contact with other youth. Staff 2 reported Staff 1\nasked Youth A to go to the cafeteria and Youth A screamed, “No!”.\nStaff 2 reported Staff 1 asked Youth A again, but Youth A began\nrunning around the room trying to hit, kick, and punch whoever\nwas nearby. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 got Youth A into a hold of\nsome sort, but she couldn’t describe what it looked like. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 was trying to get Youth A into the cafeteria, but\nshe wasn’t getting very far. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 had Youth A\nfrom behind, so Staff 2 picked him up by the legs because he\nwasn’t moving. Staff 2 reported they carried Youth A into the\ncafeteria and Youth A was screaming his pants were coming\ndown. Staff 2 reported they put him down and let him go once they\nwere in the cafeteria.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 5/7/25. Staff 3 reported he\nwas on B-side in the hallway, monitoring youth who were in their\nrooms. Staff 3 reported he did not witness Staff 1 and Staff 2\ngetting Youth A into the cafeteria.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/25/25.\nStaff 4 reported Youth A was escalated due to a peer conflict with\nYouth B. Staff 4 reported she was blocking Youth B and Staff 1\n7",
    "and Staff 2 were blocking Youth A. Staff 4 reported she took\nYouth B to another part of the milieu to get away from the\nsituation. Staff 4 reported she heard the cafeteria door open, but\ndid not see Staff 1 or Staff 2 get Youth A into the cafeteria.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 4/30/25. Staff 5 reported\nshe was not present when Staff 1 and Staff 2 brought Youth A into\nthe cafeteria and did not see how they got him there.\nSupervisor was interviewed via phone on 5/5/25. Supervisor\nreported he was not present when Staff 1 and Staff 2 brought\nYouth A into the cafeteria and did not see how they got him there.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 4/25/25. CA reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 originally\nstated they escorted Youth A to the cafeteria. However, CA now\nknows based on Staff 1 and Staff 2’s descriptions of the incident, it\nwas a restraint since both staff admitted Youth A did not want to\ngo to the cafeteria. CA reported staff should never pick up a youth\nto bring them to another room.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Youth A’s Individual Safety and Calming Plan goes over\nYouth A’s triggers, counterproductive strategies not to use,\nprecursors to aggression, calming strategies & coping\nskills, pro-active strategies, crisis intervention strategies,\nand emergency safety/last resorts. One crisis intervention\nstrategy is to allow space/time away from other peers by\nutilizing the cafeteria or his room.\n• Incident Report authored by Staff 1 dated 4/22/25 states\nYouth A attempted to bite a peer’s leg. Staff 4 blocked the\nbite using an HWC approved block. Staff 3 and Staff 2 used\ntheir bodies to separate Youth A from his peers. After\nexhausting all calm down techniques and strategies, Staff 1\nand Staff 2 escorted Youth A to the cafeteria.\n• HWC manual shows an approved two-person escort\ntechnique, which is when two staff stand on either side of a\nyouth while one hand is holding onto the youth’s wrist and\nthe other hand is placed palm-up on the youth’s back. This\nis not the escort technique described by Staff 1 or Staff 2.\n• Restraint Policy states the emergency physical intervention\nshould not be used if it is not in compliance with techniques\napproved by Hope Network Behavioral Health Services and\n8",
    "any responsible mental health agency or is not in\ncompliance with the emergency interventions authorized in\nthe youth’s individual plan or treatment plan. Restraints\nshall not be used for staff convenience.\n• Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary records in her\nemployee file. Staff 1 completed HWC training on 1/20/25\nand 1/21/25.\n• Staff 2 does not have any disciplinary records in her\nemployee file. Staff 2 completed HWC training on 10/26/23,\n10/27/23, 4/4/24, 9/18/24, and 2/6/25.\nAnalysis The facility is found in violation based on interviews conducted.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were not consistent regarding the details of\nhow they got Youth A from B-side to the cafeteria, Youth A could\nnot remember how he got into the cafeteria, and no one else\nwitnessed the situation. However, it is clear from both Staff 1 and\nStaff 2’s interviews, the way they got him there was not done\nappropriately. Whether they picked Youth A up and brought him\ninto the cafeteria, or they held onto his arms and brought him in\nthere while he was resistant, neither one is an appropriate or\napproved escort. Since Youth A was resistant, either method falls\nunder the definition of a personal restraint, and neither method is\nan approved restraint technique.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nAn email was sent to the facility on 3/14/25 explaining the\ndifference between an escort and a restraint. This was also\ndiscussed with leadership during an on-site visit at the facility for\ntheir interim audit on 4/4/25.\nConclusion Violation Established\n9",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nMay 22, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 28, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n10"
