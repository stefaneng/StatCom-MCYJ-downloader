    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nRule 400.12311 Foster parent training\nIt was suggested to the agency to use the DHHS form 1798 for foster\nparent/agency agreement opposed to the form the agency utilizes for their\nagency accreditation.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• No Consultation was provided.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. Interim\nEvaluation. The CAP was approved on 9/8/22, was a result of the 8/18//22 interim\nreview. The agency had four violations. During this renewal evaluation only three\nviolations were found. Only one was a repeat violation. Overall, the agency has\ndecreased the number of violations and has shown improvement in several areas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe CA reported that due to extenuating circumstances specific workers\nperformance, or issues with the way MiSACWIS reports data caused the repeat\nnoncompliance’s. She reported the team holds monthly “barrier busting,”\nmeetings where the supervisors discuss issues and identify and implement\nsolutions. The CA reported that there have been massive staff changeovers\nhowever, most positions have been filled. She reported there are two new foster\ncare supervisors hired and they have been working with the prior corrective action\nplan with the staff. She reported the biggest challenge has been making sure the\nworkers find the time to input data and contacts into MiSACWIS. She said moving\nforward, training of staff is occurring, and the agency is utilizing time management\nfor completion of required workload. Staff are also working with smaller workload\nnumbers.\nFinancial Overview",
    "The agency provided their annual budget. A copy of the nonprofit tax return from\nthe previous fiscal year was also reviewed. The agency also presented their\nannual audit, and it was reviewed.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe staff interviewed all reported that there have been a lot of\nstaffing/supervisory/administrative changes over the past year which resulted in\nseveral changes to the agency processes. The staff interviewed reported they feel\nsupported and feel encouraged with the recent changes.\nThere were no youth interviews.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment. Case files are\nstored in locked rooms/cabinets which prevent unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one Safety Alert.\nConcern: Unable to verify the upstairs section of the bedroom for safety due to the\ndoor being locked which is occupied by the owner of the home who has two dogs.\nThere was no way to verify if there was a working smoke detector. Resolution:\nCaseworker went to the home on 5/9/2023 and was allowed to view the upstairs\nspace. The upstairs required some cleaning but, a working smoke detector was\nobserved. The caregiver reported that the youth in the home never goes upstairs,\nand she was planning to move from the home on 6/1/23. The caseworker went back\nto the home on 5/12/23 and provided the caregiver with a safety plan that included\nthe youth not having access to the upstairs as well as a plan to provide current\nvaccinations for the dogs. Photo of the smoke detector was taken and uploaded with\nthis safety alert.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that Child Safe Michigan Judson CS will be issued a renewal of\ntheir regular license.\n6/8/2023\n_____________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6/16/2023\n_____________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager"
