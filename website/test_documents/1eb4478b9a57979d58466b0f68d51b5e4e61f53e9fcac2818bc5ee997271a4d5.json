    "I. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe violations that were found are:\nR 400.10177 Resident restraint.\n(7) Each use of material or mechanical restraint equipment shall\nbe documented in a written record and shall include all of the\nfollowing information:\n(a) The name of the resident.\n(b) The name of the administrator or designee who\nauthorized the use of the equipment, and the time of the\nauthorization.\n(c) The time the restraint equipment was applied.\n(d) The name of the staff member who was responsible for\nthe application.\n(e) A description of the specific behavior that necessitated\nits use.\n(f) The name of the staff person(s) who was continuously\nwith the resident.\n(g) The date and time of removal of the equipment and the\nname of the person removing the equipment.\nA conversation with the chief administrator revealed the facility does not document\nall of the items listed in (a) – (g) when mechanical restraints are applied, which\nincludes for the purpose of transporting youth.\nR 400.10317 Updated service plan.\n(1) An updated service plan shall be completed and\nrecorded by the social worker for each facility resident at\nleast once every 3 months after completing the initial\nservice plan.\nOne of one updated service plan reviewed was completed 30 days late. A\nconversation with the social worker revealed that she relies on the facility’s\nsoftware system (Bitstream) to alert her when service plans are due and the\nsystem does not always calculate accurate due dates.\n2",
    "II. CONSULTATION\nIn the course of reviewing meal menus and interviewing staff, it was discovered\nthe facility has been without and/or short on cooks, which has led to floor staff\ncooking meals and ordering out. When meals divert from those on the planned\nmenu, it is best practice to “write in” on the menu the actual foods that were\nserved during that particular meal.\nDental services for the youth are frequently obtained by a mobile organization\ncalled Smiles on Wheels. The organization provides documentation of the\nservice provided, but it does not include the provider’s signature. To verify that\nan actual dental exam occurred, it is best practice that the service provider signs\nthe document.\nRelease plans are computer-generated. The drop-down screen for “title of\nperson to whom youth was released” is limited and does not give DHHS worker\nor transporter as options. In these instances, the writer chooses “other” which\ndoes not identify that person’s title or role. I advised that the actual “title” of the\nperson is either manually written in on the form or that the software is\nreprogrammed to include all the possible titles of persons to whom youths may\nbe released.\nIII. EVALUATION OF INTERIM PERIOD\nThe facility has a total capacity of 50 beds, 26 treatment and 24 short-term. On\nthe date of this inspection, the census was 4 in treatment and 12 in short-term for\na total of 16 youth.\nI toured the facility and observed youth bedrooms, common areas, the\nmedication room, control rooms, clothing storage room, camera monitors, room\nspeaker system, classrooms, seclusion rooms and staff offices. I reviewed room\nmonitoring sheets, seclusion logs, updated policies, meal menus, employee files\n(paper) and open and closed youth files (electronic), and spoke with\nadministrative, supervisory, and social work staff.\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care and no corrective\naction plans required for special investigations during this licensing period.\nA corrective action plan was submitted for the Renewal Inspection report dated\n3/16/21 in which the following rule violations were cited:\nR 400.10209 (1) Resident report\nR 400.10211 (1) (c) Resident release report\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the inspection findings, the facility is not in compliance with all\napplicable rules and statutes. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action\nplan, it is recommended the facility continue their current licensing status.\nApril 19, 2022\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 19, 2022\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
