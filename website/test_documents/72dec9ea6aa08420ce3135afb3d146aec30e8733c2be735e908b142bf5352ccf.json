The process\nis outlined in the Children’s Foster Home Licensing Technical Assistance manual on\npage 18.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation in the following areas.\nVI. ANALYST CONCERNS AND RESOLUTIONS\nSAFETY ALERT 1: There is a beeping smoking detector in the room where one of the\nchildren sleep. There was also a beeping smoke detector on the first floor.\nRESOLUTION: The assigned foster care worker visited the home on 10/9/18. The FCW\nchecked all the batteries. They all were in working order.\nSAFETY ALERT 2: None\nSAFETY ALERT 3: DHS provided a crib to the relative caregiver that was not CPSC\ncompliant.\nThe crib in which the foster child sleeps does not meet CPSC requirements because it\nis a portable crib with wheels. It can be folded in scissor like fashion and rolled to a\n16",
    "desired location. Although the home is not licensed, the caregiver reported that the crib\nwas given to her by DHS Oakland County when the child was placed in her home on\nJune 25, 2018.\nAfter reading case contacts and removal information in MISACWIS, the Analyst\nprepared a Safety and Concern Alert to the Area Manager for disposition. The child\nwas removed on March 29, 2018 for prominent injuries to his body that went from his\nface to his legs. There was bleeding in his brain, hemorrhaging to his eyes, and a\nlaceration to his liver. Social work contacts mention that child wore a helmet, which\nAnalyst assumed was part of the medical treatment for his injuries.\nThe non-compliant crib increased the Safe Sleep risk because the child was in the\nprocess of recovery from significant physical injuries that brought him into care.\nRESOLUTION: The crib is certified. The crib is JPMA certified which exceeds all safety\nstandards set by CSPC and ASTM. Picture was provided.\nSAFETY ALERT 4: None\nSAFETY ALERT 5: None\nSAFETY ALERT 6: There were 2 critical safety issues observed in the home:\nCritical: CPA must have fixed and provide evidence of resolution to DCWL field\nconsultant within 5 day of receipt of DCWL Safety Alert.\n--Furniture/dressers blocking egress windows\nThe headboard of the queen sized bed in the girls' bedroom is blocking access to the\negress window.\n--Using the basement as recreational space without an egress window that all family\nmembers can climb out of.\nThe relative stated that the children occasionally play in the basement and that one of\nthe children still uses the full-sized bathroom in the basement to take showers and get\ndressed for the day, as his clothing is still stored in the basement.\nThis is a relative home; the Analyst discussed basement safety with the caregiver\nduring the visit. The home is being licensed by Wolverine. The caregiver stated that she\nwas unaware of the licensing requirement that basements cannot be used for anything\nbut storage if there is no egress window. She said the children occasionally play in the\nbasement, as it is finished.\nThe caregiver stated that Wolverine directed her to move one child from the basement\nbedroom to a second-floor bedroom because the basement bedroom did not meet\nlicensing requirements for an egress window and no viable alternatives. The caregiver\n17",
    "said that the licensing worker did not advise her about the safety risks in using the\nbasement as recreation space.\nRESOLUTION: The bed was moved away from the egress window. A face to face visit\nwas conducted on 9/21/18 to verify. Picture is attached. (Wolverine already addressed\nthe basement issue per analyst). The relative soon to be licensed foster parent signed\na basement usage agreement.\nVII. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nDuring the Interim-2017, there were substantial deficits with the writing of\nreports. In the licensing department there were violations of R 400.12324 due\nto copying and pasting of previous reports. In the foster care department,\nInitial Service Plans (ISP) were not completely filled out. Updated Service\nPlans (USP) were cut and paste from ISP’s. They lacked summaries of\npertinent information to the case, assessment of progress, and changes\nthroughout the case. Violations of R 400.12419 and R 400.12420 were present.\nThere was a pattern of initial documentation not being completed. Initial\nplacements and subsequent placements did not receive information outlined\nin R 400.12404, R 400.12405, and R 400.12417. DHHS-3307’s were not complete\nor signed by the caregiver. Relative placements did not have the DHHS-588\ncompleted on time or the 3130A completed on time. Monthly supervision was\nnot occurring in half thee files. Sibling split PERS were not consistently being\ndone. Quality case contacts were not completed with the foster children. All\nfoster care files contained violations in this area. Half of the case files did not\nhave timely case contact entries. Because of the violations, children safety\nwas in question.\nFor 2018 Renewal, the agency has made great strides in many areas. Report writing\nhas improved. In the licensing department there were no violations pertaining to\nReevaluation reports. Reports were updated. Special investigations were written\nwell, although one report was missing a CAP. Borrowed beds did not have\ndocumentation of prior approval from the foster parent. Foster parents did not\nreceive orientation and the PATP from the agency prior to placement. Although this\nis an issue, the agency feels confident this can be fixed quickly. In the foster care\n18",
    "department. There were no violations under R 400.12419 (ISP writing). ISP’s had all\nof the information requested in the reports. R 400.12420 was in violation as a repeat\nviolation this year, but not as substantial as Interim 2017. In the interim 2017, all of\nthe files did not have a summary of pertinent information and all of them did not have\nan assessment of progress. In this renewal one of the files did not have a summary\nof pertinent information and two files did not have an assessment of progress. Initial\ndocumentation, specifically DHHS 3307’s are being completed, with the exception of\none being signed after the placement date by the care giver. There were no\nviolations pertaining to DHHS 588’s or 3130A’s. Quality case contacts, with the\nexception of one file, were completed thoroughly. Supervision was completed\nmonthly for all case files. It is clear the agency has spent a great deal of time\nreviewing reports and case notes. Supervisors noted in interviews they are returning\nreports more often and taking longer to review the reports to make sure information\nis completed. Intake documentation has been an area monitored and case reviews\nhave occurred. All workers interviewed relayed the agency has worked together as a\nteam and they feel supported by their supervisors and administration.\nIn the upcoming year, the agency will need to continue to work on report writing.\nPATP’s were not consistently updated to reflect changes within the case. Medical\npassports were not consistently completed with signatures from the caregivers.\nParenting time observation will need to be looked at as well. All closed files did not\nhave the DHHS-69s available. PERS need to be updated quarterly. Another area\nfor the licensing department to improve upon is the licensing or denying of enrolled\nrelatives. The agency also has relatives with placement, that have not been enrolled\nto be licensed or waived. Overall the agency has made gains. Looking towards the\nnext year, the agency will need to maintain those gains as well as improve in the\nareas found in violation this renewal.\n19",
