This involved two late parental signatures, two late caregiver signatures, four\nmissing parental signatures and one missing caregiver signatures. Overall, there\nwere seven service plans out of twenty-nine with issues around the required\nsignatures. Two of the parental and two caregiver signatures were reported to be\nuploaded into the MiSACWIS system but under the wrong service plan document\ntab.\nThis is a repeat violation cited in the 2019 Renewal licensing inspection report\nat which time 1 of 15 service plans were found to be out of compliance and for\nwhich a CAP was approved on July 3, 2019.\nDHHS Policy Placement exception request (PER)\nFOM 722.03-\npage 14-16\nPER completed when required and completed quarterly.\n• Siblings placed apart\n6",

If allegations are found to be true a violation must be\nestablished and a formal CAP put into place.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nConsultation was provided regarding double checking dates on documents as the\nsignature on one child adoption evaluation did not match the date on the report.\nAdditionally, one special evaluation file reviewed contained a letter stating that the\nreport was provided to the family.

They all feel well trained\nand supported and had no concerns to report.\nANALYST FINDINGS\nA DCWL Field Analyst visited the homes of three licensed foster families and three\nunlicensed caregivers. The only concern reported was related to an unlicensed\nrelative caregiver stating to the analyst that her primary residence was her second\nhome, which was not listed in on any of the certification documents. This was\naddressed with the Chief Administrator who had a staff member complete a home\nvisit to the residence on 3/3/2020 to assess the home. The Chief Administrator\nreported that the second residence would be assessed annually.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nA review of the Chief Administrator Annual Assessment completed by Amy Bailey on\nwas reviewed. The Chief Administrator indicated that there has been an increase in\nstaffing throughout the year, so there was a learning curve with some staff resulting\nin missed timeframes related to some of the documentation. She reported that her\nprimary concerns were related to medical examinations and medical passport\ndocumentation, which she was hoping to address by writing a grant for a dedicated\nmedical staff that would function as a health liaison.\n9",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJune 8, 2020\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 8, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n10"
