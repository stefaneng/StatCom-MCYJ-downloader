Youth was placed in\ntheir room and monitored every 5 minutes for a total of 18 minutes but should have\nbeen monitored continuously while in restraints.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 4/29/2022 an on-site visit was made to the agency. The special investigation\nwas initiated.\nOn 4/29/2022 I met with the agency director and assistant agency director. Both\nwere advised of the initiation of the special evaluation and provided with the\nallegations. The agency director indicated that he was aware of the concern,\nconfirmed that non-compliance with the licensing rule R. 400.10177 had occurred\nand advised that he had made the call to the department to advise of the concern.\nHe further indicated that he and the assistant director had just concluded a meeting\nwith all staff involved to discuss the non-compliance and brainstorm what changes\nneeded to occur to prevent non-compliance in the future.\nOn 4/29/2022 I met with Midland County Juvenile Care Center staff that was present\nthe day of the incident. A total of five staff were interviewed. The staff included the\nfollowing:\n2",
    "Staff A - an agency supervisor employed with the agency for two years\nStaff B – a youth development worker employed with the agency for five months\nStaff C – a youth development worker employed with the agency for eleven months\nStaff D – a youth development worker employed with the agency for eight months\nStaff E – a youth development worker employed with the agency for twenty-five\nyears\nAll staff interviewed confirmed that the incident occurred on April 23, 2022, and\ninvolved youth A. It was reported that Youth A became upset because he was being\nredirected and was told to go to his room. Youth A refused to go to his room and\nbegan to escalate his behavior. It was reported that Youth A took a clock from the\nwall and broke it. The staff was concerned as Youth A has a history of self-harm.\nWhen Youth A broke the clock, he had small pieces of sharp plastic and the staff\nwas concerned for the safety of the youth and the staff. Staff A, Staff C, Staff D and\nStaff E began to make attempts to restrain Youth A. It was reported that Youth A\ncontinued to resist the attempt to restrain him, and Staff C ended up with a long\nscratch on his arm as a result of Youth A using the sharp pieces of plastic. Staff C\nand Staff D also reported that they were spit on by Youth A. Staff A reported that it\ntook about 10 minutes to get Youth A into the mechanicals and into his room.\nStaff A reported and all other staff confirmed that Youth A was “checked on” while in\nmechanicals and in his room. The staff admitted that they did not “continuously”\ncheck on Youth A during this time. The director advised that there was some\nmisunderstanding by the staff regarding the definition of “continuous”. The director\nfurther advised that as a part of the Corrective Action Plan, the agency will include a\ndefinition for “continuous” in the policy and procedures and on the mechanical\nrestraint report form.\nOn 4/29/2022 an interview of Youth A at the facility occurred. The youth was\ninterviewed privately. The youth advised that he has been placed at the facility on\nmultiple occasions. He has been at the facility for two months as a part of his\ncurrent admission. Youth A reported that he was told to go to his room, but he was\nhungry. He reports that he requested an uncrustable (peanut butter and jelly\nsandwich) but did not get it and was upset. Youth reports that he was told that he\nwould get consequences if he did not go to his room. Youth A stated that he was\nnot going to his room, became angry and took the clock off the wall. Youth A stated\nthat staff approached him, and he broke the clock. Youth A failed to confirm that he\ninjured staff with pieces of the plastic clock. Youth A reported that he continued to\nresist for about 30 minutes while staff tried to place him in shackles and handcuffs.\nHe reported that he eventually gave up and was put in his room for three days. He\nstated that he was mad but slept most of the time. Youth A reported that the staff\nremoved the shackles and handcuffs after about five minutes. He reported that the\nstaff came back to check on him a “couple” of times while he had the shackles and\nhandcuff on. Youth A confirmed that the monitoring of him while in the shackles and\nhandcuffs was “not” consistent or “continuous”. Nick confirmed that he was seen by\nthe nurse and did not complain of any injuries.\n3",
    "On 4/29/2022 the agency director was provided with the preliminary findings of the\ninvestigation.\nOn 5/03/2022 an email was received from the agency director with written\nstatements from the staff regarding the event.\nOn 5/03/2022 an email was received from the agency director with photos relevant\nto the investigation. It included pictures of Youth A, pictures of the injury of Staff C\nand pictures of the broken clock.\nThe following documents were also reviewed as a part of the investigation:\n-Written statements by staff involved in the incident on 4/23/2022\n-Pictures of injuries of staff and pictures of Youth A after the restraint\n-A copy of the Mechanical Restraint Report\n-Documentation of the notification to the legal guardian of Youth A about restraint\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10177 Resident restraint.\n(6) A staff member shall be present continuously while\nmaterial or mechanical restraint equipment is being used\non a resident.\nANALYSIS: At the conclusion of the investigation, there was sufficient\nevidence to support non-compliance of rule 400.10177. The\nagency staff reported that they failed to provide continuous\nmonitoring while the resident was in the mechanical restraint.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent upon the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted areas of noncompliance.\n______________________________________05/24/2022_________________\nCassandra Thomas Date\n4",
