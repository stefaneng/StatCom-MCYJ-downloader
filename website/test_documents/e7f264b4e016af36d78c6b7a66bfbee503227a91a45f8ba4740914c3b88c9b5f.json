This CAP contained\ntwo violations for employee files regarding verification of high school diploma and\nreference from unrelated person.

    "PREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed. The Chief Administrator\nreported since the last reporting period there has been slow movement with youth\nadmissions and discharges. This is due to the increase request of 1:1 staffing\nneeds for more acutely impaired youth and slow numbers in staff recruitment have\nprevented an increase in census. The current youth within the facility are stable.\nOver this past year a second mental health therapist has been hired and two\nactivity specialists. The BCBA model continues to be utilized with these youth\nwhich has added more individualized plans to target specific client behaviors. In\nthe upcoming year, the leadership team, BCBA, and clinical team will continue to\ndevelop the use of data metrics and behaviors driven treatment intervention as\ncoaching and training tools for the staff.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviews were conducted during the inspection and no issues or concerns\nwere raised. Staff reported they have enjoyed incorporating the tools learned by the\nBCBA specialist into their daily interactions with the youth. Staff reported they feel\nthat communication has been more streamlined from administration and feel\nsupported by upper management.\nYouth interviews were conducted during the inspection and no issues or concerns\nwere raised. The youth all reported feeling safe at the facility and feel that their\nvoice is heard. The youth reported they enjoy when staff take them outside or on\noutings.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of the facility occurred on July 11, 2024.\nThere were no issues or safety concerns noted.\n4",
