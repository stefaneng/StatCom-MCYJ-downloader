This was determined to be a lack of",

    "Financial Overview\nA review of the facility’s financial budget and 2024 financial audit were completed,\nand no concerns were noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported over the last year, they had 5 licensing rules\nthey worked to improve through a CAP, and they had successful implementation of\nthose action steps, which was confirmed by the facility having zero violations on\ntheir 2025 renewal audit. CA noted the checklist created to identify the date of\nemployees’ initial central registry clearance was very helpful, and the new resident\ndischarge document created clearly lays out youths after care plans and\nappointments, which has been helpful for discharged youth and their caregivers.\nCA reported they will continue to hold weekly leadership meetings and monthly file\naudits to ensure continued compliance.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nOne staff reported she enjoys influencing structure with the youth, transporting the\nyouth, and getting out to do activities with the youth. She reported she wishes\nthere were more effective consequences for major behaviors since the youth don't\ngo down in \"level\". She reported sometimes she feels the youth do not learn how\nto correct their behaviors because the consequences aren't serious enough. She\nreported she feels comfortable voicing her opinion, asking questions, and offering\nsuggestions. She reported she feels very supported, and she feels they have a\ngreat team. She reported she feels the team is consistent in how they manage\nexpectations and situations in the home, and feels training prepared her well for\nher role. She reported she especially valued and enjoyed the de-escalation\ntraining. She reported she enjoys the facility offers youth opportunities for learning\nsuch as raising caterpillars, cooking food, etc.\nAnother staff reported seeing youth change throughout the process, seeing how\nmuch progress they make, and seeing how they flourish are the most rewarding\nparts of the job. She reported she enjoys seeing how the youth are using their\ntools and skills in group and during other hands-on experiences. She reported she\nalso likes seeing youth graduate after they are discharged from the facility and\ncome back to invite staff to celebrate their graduation. She reported she enjoys\ndoing college tours with the youth during spring break, so they can begin to create\nnew goals for themselves, have hope for the future, and see the \"bigger picture\" of\nwhere their education can take them. She reported communication could always\nbe improved, especially in relation to making sure case notes are completed timely\nin case there's no time for a conversation between shift changes. She reported",
    "their staff turnover rate is higher because staff in college or straight out of college\ndon't understand how hard it is to work with teenagers. She reported they don't\nhave a good balance of staying firm and consistent while also being personable\nand tend to try to be \"friends\" with the youth instead. She reported they have a lot\nof activities and outings to keep the youth busy and get them out of the house\nwhen they're not in school. She reported she feels supported in her role, feels\ncomfortable giving suggestions, and feels the facility administrators/managers\naccept feedback well.\nThe supervisor reported there has been more turnover in staff recently due to\nstaff's individual education requirements and scheduling with college. The\nsupervisor reported although they're not fully staffed, they're staffed better than\nthey were last year, and have a lot more on-call staff, which has been a huge help.\nThe supervisor reported she feels supported in her role and she feels they have a\ngreat team. The supervisor reported they have great communication amongst\nemployees, but feels it could always be improved, especially from one shift to\nanother.\nYouth reported staff are nice, helpful and supportive. Youth reported the food is\ngreat and they get enough food. Youth reported the groups in the home go well.\nYouth reported they feel safe at the facility. One youth reported staff helped her\nand supported her to meet her goals and achieve success in summer school,\nschool, worked with her to increase her grades and attendance, and provided the\nnecessary motivation to increase her performance as well as her interpersonal\nskills.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility was completed on 7/21/25 and 7/22/25 and there\nwere no safety concerns noted.",
