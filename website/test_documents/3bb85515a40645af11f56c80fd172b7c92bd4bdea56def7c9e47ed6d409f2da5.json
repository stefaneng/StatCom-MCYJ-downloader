EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were not any incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nA Special Evaluation was completed on Foster Parent A when she reported she\nspanked her foster child. During the investigation the Foster Mother also admitted to\n10",
    "hitting the child with a stick. The agency found the parent in violation of R 400.9404\nBehavior Management. The agency implemented a corrective action plan which\nentailed the Foster Parent reviewing agency policy. This is not a sufficient CAP for\nthis type of violation. This was addressed with the agency management team and\nhave been found in violation of R 400.12325 License recommendation. The home is\nnow closed so no further follow-up is needed.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nSpecial Investigation 2021C0112007 was initiated when it was reported an Agency\nWorker was aware an adult was residing in the same foster home as a foster youth\nand failed to do a background check on the adult. It is alleged that the man is being\ninvestigated for sexually abusing the child. The agency was found in violation of R\n400.12309 Records Check because the worker did not complete a background\ncheck on an individual suspected of living in the home. An additional finding found\nthe agency in violation of R 400.12206 Staff Qualifications because the foster care\nworker did not visit the youth in his/her home after being told to by her supervisor.\nAn appropriate corrective action plan was submitted and approved on 1/21/21.\nThe agency has struggled greatly with staff turnover, an unqualified program director,\nand COVID. This is evidenced by the large number of violations including repeat\nviolations. The agency currently has a qualified leader in place who has been in\ncharge of the adoption department at the agency for years. The adoption department\ndid not have any violations during this review which speaks to the new director’s\nability to accomplish the task needed to achieve compliance.\nVII. Summary of Analyst Findings\nThe field analyst, Cynthia Szott, completed visits to three foster homes and three\nunlicensed relative homes. In one of the three unlicensed homes there were not\nworking smoke detectors and there was a leak in the ceiling causing damage to the\nceiling tiles. The agency bought the relative new smoke detectors and provided\npictures that they were hung. The worker confirmed they were in working order during\na visit to the home.\nRegarding the ceiling, the foster care supervisor confirmed that a contractor found no\ncurrent leaks. The stains and missing ceiling tile were most likely due to an overflow\nin the bathroom above. The agency is working with the relative to get a grant to fix\nthe ceiling. Currently there are no more safety issues in the home.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes, rules, MISEP, and contract/policy requirements. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued\na renewal of their regular license.\n11",
