Staff\n1 threw Youth A’s clothes on the floor and moved the bed off of\nthe bed frame. Youth A was upset and told the staff to stop.

Staff 1 reported he arrived at\nthe house on 1/23/23 and smelled incense burning. Youth are not\nallowed to burn incense or smoke in the house. Staff 1 knew the\nincense was likely an attempt to cover up cigarette or marijuana\nsmoke. Staff 1 went upstairs to Youth A’s room and found Youth A\nand Youth B standing in the doorway, as if they were trying to hide\nsomething. Staff 1 entered the bedroom, saw the incense, and\ntold both youth they cannot burn incense in the house. Youth B\nwent downstairs to his bedroom. Staff 1 informed Youth A he was\ngoing to search his room, as Youth A had been caught smoking\nmarijuana in the house recently. Staff 1 began looking through\nYouth A's dresser drawers. Youth A asked why he was doing that.\nStaff 1 again explained he was searching the room for drugs. Staff\n1 opened a drawer full of x-box games and Youth A grabbed his\narm.

Staff 1 reported\nthere were two small holes in the second wall, although he was\nunsure if they were from him or Youth A.\nAfter Staff 1 stood up, he walked downstairs and Youth A went to\nhis room. Staff 1 could hear Youth A pacing the floor, banging on\nsomething, and talking on his phone. Staff 1 did not know what the\nbanging noise was but did not want to go back upstairs and further\nagitate Youth A. Youth A then went downstairs into the kitchen,\n3",
    "then into the front closet, and into the bathroom where he shut the\ndoor. Staff 1 found this concerning and asked Youth A what he\nwas doing. Youth A refused to answer. Staff 1 could hear banging\nnoises in the bathroom and attempted to talk with Youth A through\nthe door. But Youth A would not respond. Staff 1 then pushed the\ndoor open and found Youth A with a paint can and a kitchen knife.\nYouth A was also holding a bottle of unknown yellow cleaning\nliquid, with several unknown pills in it.

Youth B was initially upstairs by Youth A’s bedroom\nwhen Staff 1 first came to the house. Youth A was smoking\nmarijuana and tobacco in his room. When Staff 1 arrived at the\nhouse and went upstairs he asked both youth if they had\nmarijuana. Youth A denied smoking anything but had a lighter in\nhis hand, which caused Staff 1 to be suspicious. Youth B denied\nhaving anything, then went downstairs to his room. Youth B heard\nStaff 1 state he was going to search the room. Youth A began\nyelling, with angry outbursts. Youth B described it as sounding like\na little kid throwing a tantrum. Youth B heard some banging\nsounds upstairs but did not see any of the physical interaction\nbetween Youth A and Staff 1.
