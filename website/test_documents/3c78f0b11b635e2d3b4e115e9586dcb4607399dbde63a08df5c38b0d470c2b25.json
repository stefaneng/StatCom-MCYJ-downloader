    "INVESTIGATION:\nTherapist was interviewed at the facility on July 29, 2020. He reported he has been\nassigned Resident A’s therapist since he was admitted to Wedgwood. Therapist\nstated Resident A was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Resident A did have\na safety plan that addressed his physical boundaries with others, but no safety plan\nregarding suicide ideation or self-harming behavior as Resident A had not displayed\nany of these behaviors since admission, until July 20, 2020. He could not recall if\nResident A had a history of self-harming behavior or suicide ideation prior to\nadmission.\n On July 20, 2020 Therapist was contacted by staff reporting Resident A had\nself-harmed by making superficial cuts on his wrist. Therapist met with\nResident A and placed him on High Risk Precaution as Resident A told\nTherapist his intention was to kill himself. Therapist reported High Risk\nPrecaution requires staff to have eyes on Resident A during waking hours and\ndocument his movements throughout the day. T\n On July 21, 2020 Therapist met with Resident A to follow up, along with having\na meeting with his caseworker to discuss supports for Resident A. Therapist\nthought Resident A was anxious as he is turning 18 years old and does not\nhave a support system. Therapist moved Resident A from High Risk to At Risk\nPrecaution after meeting with Resident A on Tuesday. Therapist reported\nResident A was in a “good space”, smiling, interacting with peers and Resident\nA reported feeling okay. Therapist stated Resident A did appear fatigued.\nTherapist felt this move was beneficial to Resident A as staff would still be\nkeeping a close eye on Resident A, documenting his mood and behavior every\n15 minutes but would also allow Resident A more opportunities to participate\nin activities with peers.\n On July 22, 2020 Therapist stated Resident A slept in but was in the milieu\nand interacting with his peers with no concerns. Therapist placed Resident A\non Observation Precaution which requires the same staff supervision of\ndocumenting his mood and behavior every 15 minutes, but would allow\nResident A even more opportunities to participate with peers. Therapist\nthought this would assist in increasing Resident A’s mood and reduce his\nanxiety. Therapist stated he was contacted by staff notifying him that Resident\nA had attempted to commit suicide.\nStaff 1 was interviewed at the facility on July 29, 2020. Staff 1 reported she has\nworked in the house with Resident A since his admission. Staff 1 recalled Resident\nA had a history prior to admission of suicide ideation but he had not acted upon it to\nher knowledge. Since Resident A’s admission he had no suicide ideation or self-\nharming behavior until Monday July 20, 2020.\n Staff 1 reported after Resident A self-harmed on July 20, 2020 he was placed\non High Risk Precaution. Staff 1 stated when residents are placed on High\nRisk, staff are to physically see the resident every 15 minutes or less and\ndocument the resident’s mood, behavior, and actions. All sharp items were\n3",
    "removed from Resident A and his bedroom following his self-harming\nbehavior.\n Staff 1 reported the Therapist originally moved Resident A to Observation\nPrecaution on Tuesday, however Staff 2 spoke with the Therapist informing\nhim he cannot miss At Risk Precaution as it should be a progression.\nTherapist then placed Resident A on At Risk Precaution. Staff are to continue\nto supervise Resident A and document his mood every 15 minutes are less.\n On Wednesday, Staff 1 reported she was working from 7:30am-5:30pm and\nat no point did the Therapist check on Resident A. Resident A was self-\nisolating himself in his bedroom and sleeping most of the morning. Resident A\ncame out of his bedroom at lunch time and ate with the group and was\ninteracting with his peers and staff. Staff 1 stated after lunch Resident A\nreturned to his bedroom. Staff 1 reported she asked Staff 2 if they had\nchecked on Resident A, knowing he was to be checked on due to his\nObservation Status. Staff 2 replied she had last checked on him at 1:38pm\nbut would check on him again. Staff 1 looked at her watch and it said\n1:44pm. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 yelled for her help and requested a knife as\nshe had found Resident A in his bedroom with a shirt tied around his neck\nand doorknob. Staff 1 noted that the bed appeared to have been made to\nlooked as if a person was under the covers with the pillows. Staff 1 reported\nnursing, management and 911 were contacted.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on August 5, 2020. She stated Resident A had\nno history of self-harm since he was admitted to Wedgwood.\n On July 20, 2020 he informed staff he cut his wrist and was placed on High\nRisk Precaution by the therapist. Staff 2 informed Resident A of this\nprecaution and informed him he could not participate in kids club that\nevening. High Risk Precaution requires staff to check and document on the\nresident in varying intervals not to exceed 15 minutes during waking hours\nwhile actively trying to keep the resident engaged with staff and peers\n On July 21, 2020 Therapist moved Resident A from High Risk Precaution to\nObservation Precaution. Staff 2 did not agree with this, as she indicated\nResident A complained he could not participate with his peers. Staff 2 stated\nshe argued this with Therapist, until Resident A was placed on At Risk\nPrecaution. At Risk Precaution requires staff to check and document on the\nresident in varying intervals not to exceed 15 minutes during waking hours\nand allows resident to participate in staff supervised activities.\n On July 22, 2020 Therapist placed Resident A on Observation Precaution.\nStaff 2 was not in agreement with this as Resident A was sleeping all day and\nTherapist had not interacted at all with Resident A to determine his mindset.\nObservation Precaution requires staff to check and document on the resident\nin varying intervals not to exceed 15 minutes when the resident is outside\nstaff’s direct line of sight. Staff 2 reported around lunch time, Resident A\ncame out of his bedroom from sleeping, completed chores and took a shower\nafter being directed by staff and then ate lunch. Following lunch, he returned\nto his bedroom. Staff 2 stated she checked on Resident A at 1:38pm and\n4",
    "observed him in his bedroom sitting at this desk listening to music. Staff 2\nwalked toward the staff office, and Staff 1 had asked Staff 2 if she had made\na check on Resident A. Staff 2 indicated she had, but would check on him\nagain before she started paperwork. Staff 2 reported she went to Resident\nA’s bedroom at 1:44pm where she found Resident A unresponsive, with a t-\nshirt tied around his neck and his bedroom doorknob. Staff 2 noted that the\nbed appeared to have been made to look as if a person was under the covers\nwith the pillows. Staff 2 removed the t-shirt, began CPR and nursing,\nmanagement and 911 were contacted.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via telephone on August 10, 2020.\n On Monday July 20, 2020 Resident A cut this wrist. Staff 3 reported on\nMonday the Therapist placed Resident A on High Risk Precaution where\nstaff are to have him in line of sight at all times and he is not allowed to\nparticipate in activities.\n On Tuesday he was upset he could not participate in all activities but was\nengaged and interacted with peers and staff. On Tuesday, Therapist\nplaced him on At Risk Precaution where staff are to supervise him when\nout of sight documenting every fifteen minutes\n On Wednesday, he slept all morning and came out of his room to do\nchores and eat. Staff 3 was outside when Resident A attempted suicide.\nResident A was interviewed via telephone on August 14, 2020. He reported staff\nwere checking on in often throughout the day on Wednesday, reporting he thought\nevery 10 minutes or so. He stated he just decided to commit suicide and tied a shirt\naround his neck and door.\nI reviewed the Suicide Precaution Report which shows that Resident A was placed\non High Risk Precaution on July 20, 2020 at 10am, Observation Precaution on July\n21, 2020 at 10am, which was then changed to At Risk, and on Observation\nPrecaution on July 22, 2020 at 10am.\nI reviewed the Close Observation Documentation which documents Resident A\nplaced on Observation Status on July 21, 2020 at 10:05am. The forms document\nResident A was in his bedroom sleeping, reading, or listening to music for all three\ndays. He came out to eat meals, attend house meetings or use the bathroom and\nthen would return to his room. On July 22, 2020 Resident A was documented to be\nsleeping in his bedroom until 12:30pm. He was documented to be eating lunch in\nthe milieu at 12:40pm and then checked on at 1:38pm listening to music in his\nbedroom. At 1:44pm Resident A was found by staff unresponsive with a t-shirt tied\naround his neck and his bedroom door. In review of the documentation there were 8\ntimes staff exceeded checks of 15 minutes ranging from checks completed at 16\nminutes to three hours and thirty-five minutes from the last check.\nI reviewed Resident A’s case file. Resident A’s intake summary, client assessment,\nresidential service plans, psychiatric evaluation, and therapy progress notes,\n5",
    "indicate that Resident A had one incident of suicide ideation prior to his admission at\nWedgwood. Resident A admitted to self-harm in the form of cutting when he was 11,\nbut nothing since that time, until July 20, 2020.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval\nchecks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nANALYSIS: Although staff performed appropriate checks on Resident A\nduring the time of the incident, the facility is found in non-\ncompliance as there were 8 times staff exceeded 15 minutes\nwhile supervising Resident A ranging from checks completed at\n16 minutes to three hours and thirty-five minutes from the last\ncheck.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe Precaution Matrix documents the following staff supervision requirements based\non the precaution level.\n High Risk: At this level, resident must be within sight of staff at all times\nduring waking hours, remove any items from room that could inflict harm,\nand checks/observation are to be documented no less often than every 15\nminutes during wake and sleeping hours.\n At Risk: At this level, when resident is not in direct supervision of staff,\nchecks will be made and documented no less often than every 15\nminutes, and staff are to observe resident closely and interact with them\n Observation: At this level, when resident is not in direct supervision of\nstaff, checks will be made and documented no less often than every 15\nminutes.\nDuring interviews with Therapist, Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 they reported different\nunderstanding of the supervision and documentation process for residents while\nplaced on different precaution levels.\nI reviewed employee records for the Therapist, Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3.\nTherapist and Staff 1 did not document any training regarding suicide prevention or\nprecautions. Staff 2’s training log documented participation in Adolescent Suicide\n6",
    "Prevention on 10/12/17 and 2/6/20. Staff 3’s training log documented participation in\nAdolescent Suicide Prevention on11/30/17. Staff 2 had noted two disciplinary\nactions regarding supervision of residents in 2014 and 2018. Therapist, Staff 1, and\nStaff 3 lacked any disciplinary action pertaining to supervision of residents.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as staff did not have a\nclear understanding of the precaution levels, processes and the\nfacility did not have documentation of staff receiving training of\nthe precaution levels.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe agency was provided technical assistance to review the\nPrecaution Matrix thoroughly and make changes based on best\npractice to the supervision, documentation, and activities for\nresidents. It is counterintuitive to restrict a resident from\nactivities, outings, and visits with support persons when they are\ndepressed.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSI 2019C0112015 dated 3/28/19, CAP approval date 4/19/19\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended, upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, no changes\nbe made to the status of the license of this child caring institution.\nAugust 14, 2020\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\n7",
