    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The one\nCAP submitted by the agency during the period under review was in response to\nthe 9/24/2024 licensing inspection report and was approved on 10/10/2024. That\nCAP addressed five violations, two of which were MDHHS policy requirements no\nlonger regulated by DCWL. The remaining three violations were related to special\nevaluations completion, initial service plan timeliness, and worker visits with foster\nyouth in their placement. Each of those violations were established within one file,\nrespectively and the corrective action plan was implemented successfully as\nevidenced by those violations not being repeated during this inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator was reviewed and discussed during the exit meeting. The\nchief administrator reported one foster care supervisor left the department in\nFebruary and there were not enough staff to warrant hiring in her place, so the\nexisting staff were dispersed amongst agency supervisors. The chief administrator\nindicated there have been staffing changes; however, they have been able to\nmaintain caseload compliance. There have been some compliance issues due to\ncaseload changes and staff performance issues, but nothing pervasive.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff Interviews\nThe two foster care supervisors and licensing supervisor were present during the\nentrance meeting. They reported the year has been somewhat difficult with staff\nperformance issues and staffing changes, as well as policy/licensing rule changes,\nbut they have been providing support and assistance to their staff to ensure tasks\nare completed timely and accurately. The two workers interviewed (one licensing\nand one foster care) reported there have been challenges resulting from staff\nchanges, but supervisors are supportive and helpful. They both stated their\nrespective supervisors are always available and easy to reach and will assist them\nwhenever needed. No concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office has adequate space and equipment for the delivery of foster\ncare, independent living, and certification services. Physical CHRI is stored",
    "securely within locked drawers in the licensing supervisor's office. A cross\nshredder is also present in the office and multiple cross shredders are in the office.\nClosed adoption files are locked in cabinets which are located in the main office.\nAll other files are stored securely within the office.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns were identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJuly 30, 2025\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 31, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
