    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; initial treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and date\nan initial treatment plan for each resident within 30\ncalendar days of admission.\nTwo of three current resident files reviewed did not have an initial service plan\ncompleted within the required 30 calendar days. One initial treatment plan was\nthree days late and one initial treatment plan was two days late.\nREPEAT VIOLATION Renewal report 08/11/2020; CAP approved 08/14/2020\nR 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; updated treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and date\nan updated treatment plan for each resident at least once\nevery 90-calendar days following the initial treatment plan.\nTwo of three current resident files reviewed did not have an updated service plan\ncompleted within the required 90 calendar days. One updated treatment plan was\n11 days late and another updated treatment plan was seven days late.\nREPEAT VIOLATION Renewal report 08/11/2020; CAP approved 08/14/2020\nR 400.4161 Seclusion rooms; policies and procedures.\nAn institution approved to use a seclusion room shall\nestablish and follow written policies and procedures\nspecifying its use. The policy shall include, at a minimum,\nall of the following provisions:\n(e) Staff shall observe the resident at intervals of 15\nminutes or less and shall record the observation in a\nseclusion room log. Video surveillance shall not be the only\nmeans of observation.\n(iii) Name of staff person responsible for placement.\n1",
    "One of eight seclusion room logs did not observe the resident at intervals of 15\nminutes or less. The observation time was 2:04pm and 2:30pm, 26 minutes apart.\nTwo of eight seclusion room logs did not have staff initials next to the observed time\ncheck of the resident.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHHS Policy violation. Please note that there\nare additional DHHS Policy requirements that may not be included in section 1. The\nfacility is in compliance will all additional DHHS Policy requirements.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Discussed and provided guidance on how to complete the Chief Administrator\nAnnual Assessment and Corrective Action Plan.\n Provided clarification that TB test need to be verified every one year after last\nverification or prior the expiration of the current verification. Employees will\nhave yearly TB tests based on the employee’s verification date, rather than\nhaving all employees get a TB test in May/June each year. While at the facility\nan excel spreadsheet was developed to track when yearly TB tests for all\nemployees will need to be completed. The facility will work with the contracted\nnursing staff to develop signup sheets for employees so TB tests can be\ncompleted on site.\n While on site an excel spreadsheet was developed to track when an\nemployee’s driver’s licenses expire. This will help the agency track and ensure\nthat all employees that transport youth possess a valid driver’s license.\n When youth are in seclusion staff shall observe the youth at intervals of 15\nminutes or less. The facility’s seclusion room logs documented some intervals\nof 15 minutes but not routinely throughout the seclusion.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n Clinical sessions, individual and/or group, should be documented within the\ntreatment plans or listed in MiSACWIS. This would allow the consultant to see\nthat clinical sessions have occurred without the facility having to gather other\nfiles.\n2",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nDuring the period under review there have been 11 special investigations. One\nspecial investigation is currently pending. Three investigations resulted in the facility\nbeing found in full compliance. Seven investigations resulted in the facility being\nfound in non-compliance, requiring corrective action plans. The facility submitted\nseven corrective action plans not related to maltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe non-compliances included staff qualifications, agency policies, not completing an\nincident report, health care policies and procedures, behavior management, and\nphysical restraint. During quarterly unannounced visits and corrective action plan\ncompliance reviews, the agency has successfully implemented all aspects of their\ncorrective action plans.\nInterviews with youth and staff were conducted. Youth reported feeling safe,\nreceiving treatment, and having their needs met. Staff reported recent administrative\nchanges and the hiring of more staff as a positive direction for the facility.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on their\nregular license.\nAugust 27, 2021\n________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n__ August 30, 2021\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3",
