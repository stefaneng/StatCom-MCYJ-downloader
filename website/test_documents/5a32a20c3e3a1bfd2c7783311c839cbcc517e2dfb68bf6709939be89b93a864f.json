In the first the expiration date of the license was 04/04/2021 and the\nreevaluation was dated 04/01/2021. In the second the expiration date of the license\nwas 12/12/2020 and the reevaluation report was signed 12/22/2020. In the third the\nexpiration date of the license was 06/29/2021 and the reevaluation report was\nsigned 07/15/2021.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(c) Provide a copy of the report to any social services\nworker that has children placed in the home.\nFour of the four special evaluations reviewed did not include documentation the\nsocial services worker with children placed in the home was given a copy the special\nevaluation report upon its completion.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(1) An agency shall develop service plans with the child,\nthe child's parents or legal guardian, the referring agency,\nand the other parties involved in providing needed\nservices, or medical care, unless the agency documents\nwhy any of the entities have not been involved.\nOne of the three current foster child records reviewed did not include adequate\ndocumentation that the service plans were developed with all the parties identified\nby this rule or documentation why any of the entities were not involved.\nDocumentation to indicate this involvement would include signed Parent/Agency\nTreatment Plans (PATP), which was not signed by the required parties for two report\nperiods.\n3",

In this\nexample the updated service plan with a time period ending 11/14/2020 was not\ncompleted until 01/08/2021. This is a repeat violation established from the\nannual evaluation completed 09/17/2020 with the CAP approved 10/20/2020.\nR 400.12510 Independent living contract.\n(2) The agreement shall be signed and dated by the youth\nand the social service worker.

CONSULTATION\nConsultation was not requested or required during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period for the interim evaluation completed\n09/17/2020 that was approved 10/20/2020. Areas identified in noncompliance as a\npart of the interim evaluation were R 400.12327(1)(c), (5)(a)(b), R 400.12326(1)(f), R\n400.12404(6)(a), R 400.12405(3)(g), (4), R 400.12417(1)(b)(i)(j), R\n400.12418(2)(a)(b), R 400.12509(3)(g), and R 400.12510(2). The only areas\nidentified as repeat noncompliance as a part of this renewal evaluation were R\n400.12418(2)(b) and R 400.12510(2).\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment dated 08/24/2021 reviewed areas of\nnoncompliance from the previous annual evaluation, impact of staffing changes,\nimpact of COVID restrictions, and the additional use of technology resources to\naddress ongoing case management responsibilities and supervision.\nInterviews\nEight foster care services related staff participated in entrance and exit interviews\nwith no areas of concern noted.\n5",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: In a relative home there was an operable washer and dryer in the\nsleeping room of the foster child.\nResolution: A safety plan was developed in which the washer/dryer would not be\nused while the room was occupied by the foster child and the appliance’s child\nsafety locks would be used. Photos confirmed the appliances have child safety\nlocks. A variance was also approved as a part of this relative home’s subsequent\nlicensure.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. An\nacceptable corrective action plan has been received/approved; it is recommended\nthat the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n09/13/2021\n________________________________________\nMark R.
