    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The facility\nhad nine special investigations with three investigations requiring CAPs during the\nperiod under review.

The Chief Administrator stated this has helped\nthe milieu and the programs be more consistent.
