INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 7/31/25, a staff member left medications unattended as they\nwalked away from the table two to three times. A youth took the\nbubble packs containing medications and consumed their\nprescribed medication. The youth ingested one Seroquel and one\nClonidine. This youth has a history of overdosing requiring\nhospitalization. There is a safety plan for all medication to be\nmonitored around this youth.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was contacted via email on August 5, 2025, and\nreported they had no additional information.\nYouth was interviewed via telephone on August 4, 2025, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth said she has been\nplaced at Zonta house since the end of July 2025. Youth said she\nfeels safe at Zonta house and is currently on “safe status” for\nsuicide watch. Youth said the staff at Zonta house pass her\nmedications each morning and evening. Youth said “on Thursday”\nshe was very upset with Staff 1 because he “lied on” two peers,\ntelling nursing they refused their medications when they did not\nrefuse. Youth said wanted her nighttime medications so she could\ngo to bed and Staff 1 “was taking too long” to provide them to her.\nYouth said Staff 1 left the medications unattended “a couple times”\nto go to the snack cabinet and do a check on a youth in a\nbedroom. Youth said her medications were on the dining room\ntable, so she took her “pack of medication” and took her nighttime\nmedications while Staff 1 was in the kitchen. Youth said Staff 1\nsaw her and asked her to give the medications back to him and\nshe refused and walked outside. Youth said Staff 1 and Staff 2\nfollowed her outside and watched her. Youth said she eventually\ngave them the medications and came back inside. Youth said this\nis the first time staff have left medications unattended during her\ntime at Zonta house. Youth said she took the medications because\nshe was mad at Staff 1. Youth said she does not know if she has a\nsafety plan or what it entails.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on August 4, 2025, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 said he is a direct\n2",
    "care staff and has been employed at Whaley Children’s Center\nsince February 2025. Staff 1 said he works in Zonta house with\nYouth. Staff 1 said Youth recently moved to Zonta house and had\nbeen doing well overall and he felt he had a good relationship with\nYouth. Staff 1 said during his shift on July 31, 2025, Youth\nbefriended another youth and they began to “gang up on him”\nthroughout the shift turning everything he said to them the wrong\nway and getting more and more upset as the day went on. Staff 1\nsaid Staff 2 came into work around medication time however it\nwas decided he would pass Youth’s evening medications. Staff 1\nsaid Youth refused her medications and he did not push her but\nrather said “ok” and let her have space. Staff 1 said he left with\nanother youth for a period of time and upon his return to Zonta\nhouse Staff 2 told him he needed to pass Youth’s medications and\npulled it all out to the table and then walked back to the couch.\nStaff 1 said he walked over to the snack cabinet with the\nmedication box and then went back to the dining room table and\nsat down. Staff 1 said he began to get Youth’s medications\nprepared for distribution when Youth walked over and grabbed two\nmedication packs and walked to the back of the house. Staff 1\nsaid he asked Youth to give him back the medications and he\nrefused so he asked Staff 2 for assistance in retrieving the\nmedications. Staff 1 said Youth walked outside and he followed\nher. Staff 1 said he and Staff 2 switched and she stayed outside\nwith Youth while he returned inside. Staff 1 said he called\nSupervisor to notify him and ask for guidance and assistance.\nStaff 1 said he witnessed Youth take one medication prior to\nSupervisor arriving and getting all medications away from Youth.\nStaff 1 said he did a medication count which revealed Youth took\none pill from each bubble pack which is her normal evening\ndosage. Staff 1 said his understanding of the medication\nadministration policy is staff are to get medications prepared away\nfrom youth and sign the medication log as medications are\npopped and placed in a cup, call the youth to the table, provide\nthe youth medications with water, and do a mouth check to ensure\nthey have taken the medications. Staff 1 denied the medication\npolicy requiring medications to be prepared and passed in a\nlocked or secure area, noting the youth are supposed to stay an\narm length away from staff when they have the medications out.\nStaff 1 said medications are stored in a locked closet in the\nhallway. Staff 1 said that day was very difficult for him as Youth\nand her peers had been verbally abusing him throughout the day.\nStaff 1 said Youth has a safety plan that prevents her from going\nto the main campus to receive her medication from the nursing\nstaff. Staff 1 denied being aware of any other safety plan for\nYouth.\n3",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on August\n6, 2025. Staff 2 said she was working the evening of July 31,\n2025, with Staff 1. Staff 2 said Staff 1 took Youth’s medication box\nto the dining room with Youth present. Staff 2 said she was in the\nliving room with other youth. Staff 2 said she did not see what took\nplace in the dining room. Staff 2 said Youth walked into the living\nroom and had two bubble packs of medication in her hand. Staff 2\nsaid she asked Youth to give her the medications, and she refused\nand walked outside. Staff 2 said she followed Youth outside and\nwas talking with her and asking her to give her the medication\npacks. Staff 2 said Supervisor pulled into the driveway and was\nable to talk with Youth and get the medication packs from her.\nStaff 2 said she sat outside and talked with Youth who reported\nthat Staff 1 had stepped away from the medications and so she\ngrabbed them and walked away. Staff 2 said normally works third\nshift and does not pass medication and so wanted Staff 1 to pass\nthe medications as he is used to having to do it on second shift.\nStaff 2 said Youth is on a safety plan and cannot go to main\ncampus to get her medication. Staff 2 said she is not confident in\nall of the steps of medication administration, but she does know\nthat staff are not supposed to ever leave medications unattended.\nStaff 2 said the medications are kept in a locked closet and\nnormally prepped by staff at the dining room table.

Staff 3 said all medications are locked in the hallway\ncloset. Staff 3 said the normal medication passing procedure is for\nstaff to get the youth’s medication box out of the closet and take it\nto the dining room table where they review and pull the\nappropriate medications and place the medication in a small cup\nand then either take the medication to the youth for them to take\nthem or have the youth come to the table to take the medications.\nStaff 3 said the medications are never left unattended and that\nyouth are never allowed to be within arm’s length of the\nmedications as they are out on the table. Staff 3 said if there are\nissues within the house with youth behaviors then the medications\nshould not be brought out into the dining room or if there becomes\nan issue while the medications are out then they are to be put\naway immediately. Staff 3 said should this occur, the nurses would\nbe notified and either assist in medication passing or give\ndirectives on how the staff should proceed with medication\npassing.

Supervisor said he immediately went to Zonta\nhouse and upon his arrival Youth was outside and gave two\nmedication bubble packs to him right away. Supervisor said Youth\ntold him she took one pill out of each pack, and he did a\nmedication count with Staff 1 which confirmed her statement.\nSupervisor said he directed Staff 1 to secure Youth’s medications,\nand he did.

Therapist said Youth was placed at Mott\nChildren’s Residence and recently moved to Zonta house.\nTherapist said there was a safety plan that was written prior to her\nbecoming Youth’s therapist and then since then there was a\nseparation plan in place for Youth and a peer at Mott Children’s\nResidence due to inappropriate boundaries which prohibits Youth\nfrom going to the main campus.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage of July 31, 2025, dining room area, was\nreviewed on August 5, 2025. Staff 1 is sitting at the dining room\ntable with seven bubble packs of pills, a white bag, serval papers,\nand a bottle of water in front of him. Youth is seen entering the\ndining room and taking the white bag, opening it, and taking a box\nout of the bag and turning to the right so the front part of her body\nand hands are off camera. Youth turns further around, and she is\nseen shaking an inhaler and then putting it to her mouth, Staff 1\nstands up and walks a few feet closer to her, leaving all the other\nmedications on the table. Youth places the inhaler back in the box\nand tosses it towards the table and it goes across the table onto\nthe floor.

    "walks to table and puts the other bubble packs in a pile but then\nleaves them on the table and follows another youth out of the\nroom leaving a third youth in the dining room unattended with the\nmedications on the table. Staff 1 reenters the dining room and\nthen exits, medications still unattended on the table for about 20\nseconds, then reenters the room and walks to the medications\nand picks them all up and places them in the box and takes the\nbox with the medications off camera view.

Staff 1\ncompleted medication passing training during New Hire\nOrientation on February 14, 2025.\n• Whaley Children’s Center Incident Reports dated July 31,\n2025, regarding Youth A was reviewed. The first incident\nreport was regarding Youth A’s actions leading up to\nmedication passing which clearly indicated she was\ndysregulated and is consistent with Staff 1’s interview. The\nsecond incident report was regarding Youth A taking the\nmedications which was written by Staff 1 and is consistent\nwith his interview.\n• Whaley Children’s Center Medication Policy was reviewed.\nThe policy outlines the medication administration procedure\nand clearly states “Never leave medications unattended”. In\naddition, the normal practice for medication passing is “all\nof the medication passes for the child and youth will take\nplace at the medical office”.\n• Whaley Children’s Center Safety Plan for Youth was\nreviewed. The safety plan is dated May 14, 2025, and\nprovides background information on Youth specifically\nstating “[Youth] attempted to overdose on Tylenol, resulting\nin her current hospitalization”. The plan reviews precautions\nthat staff must take with Youth including “[Youth] also has a\nhistory of ‘cheeking’ medications, and any medication\ndistribution should be closely monitored”.\n• Youth’s Separation Plan dated June 6, 2025, was\nreviewed. The separation plan indicates Youth must be on\na “level 2 separation” from another youth. The level 2\nseparation is defined for staff and provides maximum\nseparation at all times due to allegations, precaution, and\ninappropriate boundaries between Youth and a peer.\n6",
    "Analysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per Youth’s and staff\ninterviews, video review, and documentation review, Staff 1 did\nnot follow the agency’s policy regarding medication administration\nand left medications unattended resulting in Youth having access\nto take her medication packs.\nTechnical Assistance:\nIt is recommended the staff prepare all medications in a locked\narea and do not take youth’s entire monthly supply of medication\ninto an open uncontrolled area. Further, it is recommended the\nmedication distribution also occurs from a controlled or locked\narea such as the Zonta house locked laundry room. If this is not\npossible, then it is recommended the nurses prepare the\nmedications in their locked area and transport the individual doses\nto the Zonta house and pass the medications to the youth at the\nZonta house.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n_____________________________________September 8, 2025\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 10, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n7"
