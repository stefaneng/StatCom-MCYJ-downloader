    "PREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted staffing has been fairly consistent and they are\ncontinuing to hire new staff. CA reported the biggest barrier to hiring has been\nwaiting on out of state background checks. CA noted they have had a full and\nsteady clinical team for a while now, which has been very beneficial for consistency\nof care and treatment for youth. CA noted they continue to address issues related\nto CAP compliance for violations on special investigations, especially with the\nrecent repeat violations regarding medication administration.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported the following:\n- There have been some recent transitions with supervisors as one APM just left for\na different position and another APM resigned. Their losses have caused some\nfriction, but staff are recovering, and things are getting better. They've hired two\nnew APMs and they're fitting in well to their roles. They're in a good spot staffing-\nwise and don't feel there is a lot of turnover with staff.\n- It appears there's been a culture shift recently regarding staff, and staff are truly\nmeeting youth where they're at and approaching things with more grace than they\nhave in the past. Younger staff have grown through coaching and evaluations, and\nthere is more consistency in treatment as well as approaches with youth. They're\ncontinuing to work on making sure they're up to date on eCare documentation and\nmaking that a priority right after the safety and well-being of youth. If difficult\nconversations need to happen between staff, they're happening in a healthy way,\nand there's great conflict resolution skills being used. There's less conflict, gossip &\ncliques amongst staff, which is helping the shift in culture. Credit should be given to\nCA and Manager of Program Operations for leading from the top down. Staff and\nsupervisors have access to CA and Manager of Program Operations frequently,\nand it's very helpful in providing the support staff and supervisors require.\n- Activities with youth are going really well. They try to get the youth out as much as\nthey can. During breaks and weekends, they have approximately 2-3 options to\nchoose from. On school days, they do science activities, cooking groups, outside\ntime at parks, etc. Feedback is taken really well by staff and management.\nManagement is very supportive. Training is sufficient for their roles.\n- Staff feel supported, and they have a really good crew. There is great\ncommunication and feedback between peers and management. Upper\nmanagement has been putting forth a lot of effort to be present and supportive. The\n4",
    "only room for improvement would be the difference in quality for shadow shift\ntraining for new employees. The person doing shadow shift training may not know\nahead of time they're doing the training due to picking up a shift or something else\nhappening, so there is sometimes a lack of preparedness which causes a lack of\nconsistency in training. However, if staff are following the paperwork adequately,\nthere shouldn't be a problem.\nYouth reported they do a lot of fun things and enjoy the outings staff take them on.\nYouth reported staff are nice, supportive, and helpful. Youth reported the food is\ngood and they get enough food. Youth reported they feel safe at the facility and\nhave staff they can speak with if they need something. Youth reported no concerns\nwith the facility or staff.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility was completed on 4/4/25 and there were no safety\nconcerns noted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nApril 8, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 10, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
