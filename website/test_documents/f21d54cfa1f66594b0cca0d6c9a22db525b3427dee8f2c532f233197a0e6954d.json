INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff did not transport youth to the hospital when it was necessary.\nInvestigation The Complainant was contacted on 07/03/2024 and had no\nadditional information to provide.\nYouth A was interviewed during an unannounced visit to her\nschool with DHHS Worker 1 on 06/12/2024. Youth A provided\nrecollections of instances when she needed medical attention at a\nhospital and was refused that service by staff. She recalled an\ninstance that she could not date where she had back pain and a\nstaff that she could not recall refused to take her to the hospital.\nShe recalled being inside the house and because they refused to\ntake her, she walked out. Youth A recalled planning on walking to\nthe hospital. She stated that it did not take long for law\nenforcement to ride up beside her. She told them she was\nwalking to the hospital, and she was not going back to the facility.\nYouth A recalled talking with law enforcement for a little while on\nthe sidewalk and eventually they took her back to the facility.\nYouth A stated she then went inside, sat down and waited for law\nenforcement to leave, and then immediately left the facility to\nAWOL again. Youth A stated this was when she found some\nbroken glass and cut her forearms with it. Youth A believed\nfacility staff had called law enforcement again after she walked out\nthe second time, and officers drove up next to her again. She\nrecalled being transported to the hospital by law enforcement at\nthat time. Youth A also recalled an incident where she AWOL’ed\nfrom the house in a similar manner, but on this occasion, she\nreturned to the house on her own. She stated Staff 1 was present\nas was law enforcement. When she arrived, she showed that she\nhad cut her forearm with some broken glass she had found.\nYouth A expressed the need to go to the hospital at that time.\nYouth A believed Staff 1 stated she did not need to go, only for the\n2",
    "law enforcement officer to take Youth A outside to speak with her.\nShe then reported the officer took Youth A to the hospital.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n06/17/2024. She stated there had been many incidents when she\nhad worked with Youth A and there was an instance of AWOL.\nStaff 1 recalled the incident where Youth A left the facility and\nAWOL’ed and law enforcement was called, only for Youth A to\narrive back at the facility shortly after law enforcement had also\nreported to the facility. Staff 1 recalled Youth A talking directly\nwith law enforcement, and she remembered Youth A telling them\nthat she was triggered by Staff 1. She stated Youth A then\nrequested to call the Community Mental Health (CMH) crisis line\nand Staff 1 assisted her in doing so. Staff 1 did not believe this\nincident led to Youth A going to the hospital.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n06/17/2024. He stated he was not present at the facility during the\nincident in question, despite being familiar with what occurred.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed over the phone with\nDHHS Worker 1 on 06/17/2024. She recalled the incident in\nquestion that occurred on 06/09/2024. The Chief Administrator\nstated the largest part of Youth A’s escalation occurred when the\ninvolved staff, of which she could not recall at that time, offered to\ntake her to Urgent Care to have attention given to her back pain.\nThis upset Youth A, who only wanted to go to the hospital. The\nChief Administrator believed that by the chance any other\ndiscussion or offers or options took place Youth A escalated\nfurther and left the facility.\nDuring a video conference on 07/03/2034 DHHS Worker 1\nprovided an update on her investigation and was not able to state\na final result at that time.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Multiple incident reports from the facility regarding AWOLs\nfor Youth A from June 2024. The documentation was\nconsistent with interviews provided.\n• Documentation from local law enforcement dated\n06/09/2024 was provided and reviewed. This\ndocumentation described the instance of Youth A’s AWOL\nand return to the facility shortly after law enforcement’s\narrival. The officer described arriving at the facility and\nspeaking with Staff 1. He stated Staff 1 did not know where\nYouth A was and eventually requested she be listed as a\n3",
    "runaway. It was then that Youth A arrived back at the\nfacility. Youth A entered through the backdoor and law\nenforcement spoke directly with her. Law enforcement\ndescribed the lacerations to her forearm and that she\nexpressed a need to go to the hospital. Youth A reported to\nlaw enforcement that they were uncomfortable around Staff\n1 and Staff 1 “treats her badly.” As Staff 1 was calling\nfacility management to discuss transporting Youth A to the\nhospital, Youth A stated to law enforcement that she\n“wanted to end it all” and law enforcement made the\ndecision to transport her to the hospital themselves.\n• Facility policy titled “Health Services: Policies and\nProcedures” and dated 01/14/2024 was reviewed. This\npolicy stated that for youth that had emergency care needs,\n“an ambulance or transportation to the hospital would be\narranged.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed. There was no evidence\nfound that Youth A was denied proper medical attention during\nany incidents described.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff are not providing medication to Youth A.\nInvestigation The Complainant was contacted on 07/03/2024 and had no\nadditional information to provide.\nYouth A was interviewed during an unannounced visit to her\nschool with DHHS Worker 1 on 06/12/2024. Youth A reported\nthere was a recent occasion where Staff 1 would not provide her\nmedication. Youth A recalled Staff 1 asking her to go get a glass\nof water so her medication could be provided. Youth A stated she\n4",
    "was busy doing something on the couch. Youth A believed the\nnext thing that occurred was Staff 1 told her “then I will mark you\ndown that you refused your medication.” Youth A recalled getting\nup and getting a cup of water but at that time Staff 1 would not\ngive her medications out. Youth A clarified this was her nighttime\ndosage of medication, and she was not sure if she went to bed\nwithout her medication that night.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n06/17/2024. Staff 1 recalled the incident in question where Youth\nA refused her medication. She stated she was working with Staff\n2 that evening. Staff 1 requested Youth A get a glass of water to\ntake her medication, and Youth A then responded by stating “I’ll\nget that when I feel like it.” Staff 1 explained to Youth A she had\nto provide the medication now because she had already unlocked\nthe medication cabinet. Youth A told her she was going to take\nher medication when she felt like it. Staff 1 recalled telling Youth\nA she would have to document this as a medication refusal if that\nwas going to be Youth A’s choice. Staff 1 stated this was when\nYouth A escalated, screaming and demanding to call the CMH\ncrisis phone line. When Staff 1 offered for Youth A to call the\nfacility therapist with which she worked with, Youth A continued to\nescalate further. Staff 1 recalled contacting the License Designee\nand she was instructed to call the CMH crisis line with Youth A.\nStaff 1 recalled that before this could occur, Youth A left the facility\nin an attempt to AWOL. Staff 1 stated Youth A was eventually\nlocated by law enforcement and transported to the hospital.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n06/17/2024. Staff 2 stated he was often paired with Youth A for\nthe passing of her medication. He recalled many instances where\nYouth A has refused to take her medication at the normal time it is\noffered. Staff 2 could not recall a specific time of medication\npassing similar to what was alleged by Youth A.\nStaff 4 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n07/03/2024. Staff 4 somewhat remembered the incident, recalling\nStaff 1 asked Youth A to get ready to take her medications. Staff\n4 believed Youth A did not respond in an agreeable manner, and\nescalated to the point where she couldn’t be offered her\nmedications at that time. Staff 4 did not believe Staff 1 ever\nrefused to provide the medications to Youth A.\nDuring a video conference on 07/03/2034 DHHS Worker 1\nprovided an update on her investigation and was not able to state\na final result at that time.\n5",
    "Documentation reviewed:\n• Facility incident reports were provided and reviewed:\no Staff 1 authored an incident report dated 06/09/2024\ndescribing the course of events of offering Youth A\nher medication. The details in this documentation\nwere consistent with interviews provided.\no Staff 2 authored an incident report dated 06/09/2024\ndescribing the course of events of Staff 1 offering\nYouth A her medication. Staff 2 described Staff 1\noffered the medication and when Youth A stated she\nwould get water to take it “when she felt like it.” Staff\n2 stated Staff 1 gave Youth A some time before\ncontinuing to attempt to provide the\nmedication. When Youth A came back and stated\nshe was then ready, Staff 1 was in the middle of\nanother task and stated she would get back to\npassing the medication when she was able, and\nYouth A escalated verbally and then physically from\nthere.\n• Facility medication log documentation was provided and\nreviewed. Youth A was prescribed two medications to take\nin the evenings, and because she was in the hospital they\nwere not provided on location on the evening of\n06/09/2024.\n• Hospital documentation dated 06/09/2024 was reviewed.\nThis documented a mental health evaluation that was\nprovided to Youth A after she was brought to the hospital\nby law enforcement. This document aligns with details in\nthe incident report and with interviews provided. This\ndocumentation showed that Youth A received her evening\nmedications while at the hospital after they were initially\noffered at the facility.\n• Facility policy titled “Health Services: Policies and\nProcedures” and dated 01/14/2024 was reviewed. The\nfacility utilizes two policy books for staff and for youth, but\nthere was no policy and procedure found describing what\nstaff are to do in an instance when a youth is refusing\nmedication.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed. There was no evidence\nfound that Youth A was not offered her medication as prescribed,\nand the escalation in behavior and need for law enforcement and\nmedical professional involvement did not allow facility staff to\n6",
    "continue attempts to provide medication on the evening of\n06/09/2024.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility is advised to increase the number of staff who\nare trained to properly pass medications. This would\nreduce the chances of youth missing their medications\nbecause they are escalated at the time they are offered by\nthe currently available staff trained for this purpose.\n• While incident reporting documentation for this incident was\nsufficient, the facility is advised to revise their policies and\nprocedures that are intended to meet this rule to include\ndirections on what staff are to do when a youth is refusing\ntheir medications.\nConsultation provided:\n• The facility is advised to continue assessing and looking to\nimprove staff training and support in rapport building and\nverbal de-escalation with youth.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code Personal hygiene\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4148\nSection (1) An institution shall assure that each resident maintains or\nDescription receives personal care, hygiene, and grooming appropriate to\nthe resident's age, sex, race, cultural background, and health\nneeds.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth was not provided necessary hygiene products.\nInvestigation During a face-to-face interview at her school with DHHS Worker 1\non 06/12/2024, Youth A reported there was an occasion the prior\nday (06/11/2024) that staff at the facility did not provide her with\nfeminine hygiene product. When asked specifically which staff\nrefused to provide these to her, Youth A named Staff 2 as the staff\nthat did not provide those items to her. Youth A recalled getting\nmore upset after this, punching a wall next to the office and then\nleaving the facility. Youth A stated law enforcement picked her up\noutside and she eventually went to the hospital. She also noted\n7",
    "she received the needed hygiene items after returning from the\nhospital and the morning of the interview.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n06/17/2024. He recalled the incident that occurred on 06/11/2024\ninvolving Youth A and the need for hygiene products. He had\nheard from other staff that Youth A needed hygiene products while\nshe was at school and staff purchased more of these items for\nwhen she was back home from school. Staff 2 didn’t remember\nthis coming up until later in the evening when Youth A came\ndownstairs and asked for some of the items. Staff 2 recalled\nYouth A escalating quickly and seemingly without reason, claiming\nthe hygiene items had been purchased would only be for her and\nno other youth. Youth A was offered the hygiene items again by\nhe and Staff 6 and she refused. Youth A then escalated further,\npunching walls and eventually encountering law enforcement and\nbeing transported to the hospital.\nStaff 5 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 over the phone on\n07/03/2024. Staff 5 recalled being on staff on 06/11/2024 during\nthe incident in question. Staff 5 stated he did not interact directly\nwith Youth A during this, but he did witness Youth A request\nneeded hygiene products from Staff 2 and, as he described,\nalmost immediately she “got an attitude” and did not accept what\nwas offered to her. Staff 5 witnessed Staff 2 and Youth A looking\nin the supply closet upstairs together during their interaction. Staff\n5 saw Youth A then go downstairs in a “hissy fit.” He recalled\nStaff 2’s reaction to Youth A as calm and appropriate.\nStaff 6 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 over the phone on\n07/03/2024. Staff 6 recalled Youth A asking to Staff 2 that she\nneeded a hygiene product. Because Staff 6 was assisting another\nyouth, Staff 2 went to provide this to Youth A. Staff 6 recalled\nStaff 2 asking her for help to make sure the right product was\noffered, and Staff 2 asked Youth A for a preference. Staff 6\nrecalled Youth A getting upset and stating she was only talking to\nStaff 2, and not Staff 6. Staff 6 asked Staff 2 to take over the\ninteraction in order to assist Youth A in staying calm. Staff 6\nrecalled Youth A escalating from there, believing that she\neventually left the facility.\nDuring a video conference on 07/03/2034 DHHS Worker 1\nprovided an update on her investigation and was not able to state\na final result at that time.\n8",
    "Documentation reviewed:\n• Facility incident report documentation dated 06/11/2024\nwas reviewed. This document described an incident where\nYouth A became upset at staff because she believed she\nwas being deprived of sanitary napkins that were meant\nspecifically for her. It was explained to Youth A the sanitary\nnapkins she referred to were for all the youth in the\nprogram. Youth A’s behavior escalated to the point where\nshe was screaming and punching a wall. She did not\nrespond to offers to speak with the facility therapist, and the\nbehavior continued. Staff eventually called law\nenforcement because of the property damage occurring.\nYouth A then left the facility and went AWOL, and she was\nlocated shortly thereafter and transported to the hospital for\nevaluation.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed. There was no evidence\nfound that hygiene products for Youth A were withheld from her on\n06/11/2024.\nConsultation provided:\n• Continued staff training regarding normal behaviors for\nyouth in this facility is needed. While it was clear that\nYouth A escalated in a quick manner during this incident,\nhaving it described as a “hissy fit” displays a lack of\nunderstanding of the common struggles with emotional\nintelligence and frustration tolerance for youth being served\nby the facility.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited\nto:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\n9",
    "Violation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth was allegedly restrained during an altercation with another\nyouth.\nInvestigation During a face-to-face interview at her school with DHHS Worker 1\non 06/12/2024, Youth A reported there was an occasion that staff\n“went hands on” her, and she took issue with this because the\nfacility is not allowed to restrain youth. Youth A was not able to\nfurther clarify what she meant by “hands on,” only repeating that\nthe youth at the facility are not supposed to be restrained and she\nknew what this was like from past placements that did utilize\nrestraints. Youth A recalled getting into a physical altercation with\nYouth C. Youth C was already outside in the front yard and Youth\nA went out to meet her after Youth C asked her to in order to fight.\nYouth A recalled Staff 2 and Staff 3 were present as well. Youth A\nrecalled both of the staff attempting to get in between the two\nyouth and prevent them from fighting. Youth A stated the physical\naltercation between she and Youth C ended when Youth C hit\nYouth A in the face, and then Youth A attempted to jump over the\nfence of the facility to get away. Youth A could not specify how\nthe two staff members involved physically engaged with the youth\nthemselves other than to say that they attempted to get in\nbetween Youth A and Youth C. Youth A showed a faint bruise on\nher leg, and she stated she received it from the incident, but could\nnot specify how or from who.\nYouth B was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 over the phone on\n06/17/2024. She stated she witnessed the incident involving\nYouth A and Youth C. She recalled staying in the house and\nwitnessing Youth A and Youth C trying to fight outside. Youth B\nrecalled seeing Staff 3 attempting to stop Youth A from getting\npast her to fight Youth C. Youth B described Staff 3’s actions as\nholding her hands out at either side and standing near Youth A\nand facing her. Youth B did not state whether Staff 3 touched\nYouth A in any way. She remembered the next thing that\nhappened was Youth A fell to the ground and Staff 3 fell on top of\nher. Youth B recalled Staff 3 getting up quickly. Youth B believed\nthis fall for both individuals was accidental. Youth B stated she\ndid not see any more of the interaction.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone on 10/16/2024. She\nrecalled the incident in question. Staff 3 could not recall why\nYouth A and Youth C were upset at each other, but she did recall\nthe altercation escalated significantly when Youth C was outside\n10",
    "and yelling to Youth A to come outside to fight her. Staff 3\nrecalled going outside with Staff 2 to address the youth. Staff 3\nrecalled going to Youth A, and she believed Staff 2 went to Youth\nC. In doing so Staff 3 believed Youth C went around the other\nside of the building outside and eventually ended up at the back\ndoor to enter back inside. As that occurred, Staff 3 recalled Youth\nA wanting to chase Youth C and fight her. Staff 3 stated she\nattempted to stop this by standing in front of Youth A with her\narms out wide, blocking her path but taking care to not touch\nYouth A. Staff 3 stated Youth A was standing with her back\nagainst the fence in the front of the property, and Staff 3 stated\nshe had her own hands on the fence to try to block Youth A from\ngetting past her to attack Youth C. Staff 3 recalled she and Youth\nA fell over and Staff 3 was on top of Youth A’s side. Staff 3 could\nnot recall exactly how this occurred, but she believed it was\ncaused by Youth A attempting to get past Staff 3. She recalled\nthey were on the ground for only a moment and Youth A was up\nand going around the house, presumably to find Youth C. Staff 3\ncould not recall exactly how the situation was diffused but stated\nthere were no moments of hands on contact between anyone after\nthat point in time. Staff 3 was not injured during the incident and\nbelieved Youth A experienced the same.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n06/17/2024. He recalled working the day that Youth A and Youth\nC had a physical altercation. Youth C was already outside when\nYouth A came out and wanted to fight her. Staff 2 recalled trying\nto stay in between the two youth, and he believed Staff 3 was\ndoing the same. Staff 2 recalled ending up on the front porch with\nYouth C, and Staff 3 was in the front yard near the fence with\nYouth A. Staff 2 did not see any physical interaction between\nStaff 3 and Youth A because he had followed Youth C around to\nthe back of the house. He stated law enforcement arrived shortly\nthereafter and began to further de-escalate the situation.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed over the phone with\nDHHS Worker 1 on 06/17/2024. She confirmed the location of\nwhere Youth A and Staff 3 were outside is not covered by the\nfacility security cameras.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Facility incident report dated 06/04/2024 was provided and\nreviewed. Details in this incident report were consistent\nwith interviews provided.\n• Law enforcement documentation was provided and\nreviewed. A police report dated 06/04/2024 described law\n11",
    "enforcement arrived on the scene after the instance of\nalleged contact between Youth A and Staff 3 and detailed\nalleged assaultive behavior between Youth A and Youth C.\n• Facility policy titled “Interventions” last dated 01/14/2024\nwas reviewed, which stated that the use of physical\ndiscipline inflicted in any manner was prohibited.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed. There was no evidence\nfound that Staff 3 performed a restraint, nor was there evidence\nfound that she struck Youth A in a prohibited manner.\nConsultation provided:\n• The facility is advised to continue to discuss and train on\nphysical contact with youth by staff. The facility has chosen\nto not implement physical managements as a behavior\nintervention and that is not in question, but escalated youth\ncan still present situations where physical contact occurs\nand further debriefing on incidents such as this would be\nbeneficial for staff.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/17/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/23/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n12"
