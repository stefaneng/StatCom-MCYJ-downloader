Youth A said he was bouncing a\nbasketball and “lost control” of the ball, and it hit Staff 1 in the\nlegs. Youth A said Staff 1 then walked over to him and “chest\nbumped” him. Youth A said he was not upset with Staff 1 and did\nnot want her to get into trouble and the only reason he called it in\nwas because he thought she was going to press charges on him\nfor running away and he wanted to try to get her into trouble as\nwell. Youth A then got up and walked out of the interview, refusing\nto discuss the incident further.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nJanuary 24, 2024.
