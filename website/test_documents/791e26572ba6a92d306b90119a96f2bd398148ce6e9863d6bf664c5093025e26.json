Program Description\nLet’s Talk About It Girls’ Home III is a community based residential program located in\nKalamazoo with a mission statement of “Empowering and equipping youth for success\nbeyond foster care”. The program will serve 12 female youth between the ages of 13\nand 18 who have experienced abuse/neglect and struggled with mental/emotional\nstability. These struggles can involve a need to develop skills for independent living,\nsubstance abuse history, minimal behavioral issues (minimal aggression), difficulty in\nestablishing healthy relationships, and a history of abuse/neglect. The program will\nprovide an average length of stay between six and nine months with general outcome\ngoals of family reunification, entrance into independent living or adoption, if applicable.\nThe program will also focus on helping the youth develop the additional outcomes:\n Emotionally stability\n Independent living skills\n Understanding of the trauma in their lives and methods to cope with it\n Connection to community health (physical and mental) support systems\nThe program will provide a variety of treatment services starting with Psychiatric\nconsultations and evaluations within seven days of admission. Weekly trauma informed\nindividual, family and group therapy sessions. The therapy sessions will follow what is\noutlined in the youth’s treatment plan along with self-help groups and family activities as\noutlined in the treatment plan. Educational services will be provided to support the\nyouth’s educational efforts and each youth will be enrolled in a local school program.\nThis will involve tutoring if necessary, advocacy at IEP meetings and coordination with\nall meetings at the youth’s school. Part of the independent living skills training will\ninvolve a substance abuse assessment and education, health education (hygiene and\nsexual choices) and education on the different aspects of self-esteem and healthy\nrelationships. The program is designed to address other issues as they are identified in\nthe assessment/evaluation process and outlined in the youth’s treatment plan. The\nyouth’s required activities are those activities that support the treatment goals and help\nto build positive skills within the youth.\nThe intake/assessment process for youth involves the Psychiatric consultation and\nevaluations within seven days of admission. The facility will use three assessment tools\n(Adverse Childhood Experience [ACE], Biopsychosocial, Resilience and Casey Ansley)\nto ensure that the identified problems bringing the youth into care are addressed in the\ntreatment goal development. Referrals will be received from the Department of Health\n4",
    "and Human Services, private child placing agencies and courts. If the youth meets the\nadmission criteria, (between the age of 13-18, have a IQ of 75 or above, exhibit minimal\naggressive behaviors, have a low AWLOP risk, no history of fire starting, and no active\nsubstance use) the admission team will schedule an interview with the youth to further\ndetermine if admission is appropriate. Once a determination is made for acceptance,\nthe facility will notify the referring worker within two business days. Factors considered\nfor room assignments will involve age, history of sexual acting out, and developmental\nlevel.\nTreatment goals will be developed through presenting problems (circumstances that\nbrought the youth into care) identified through the intake process, clinical assessments\n(if identified as needed), information provided by the referring worker and youth’s\nparents/caregiver, and a review of past assessments. The individualized treatment plan\ndeveloped will be agreed upon by the youth and they will receive a copy of the plan.\nThe youth and parents/caregivers will both be involved in the different goals and skill\nbuilding techniques in an effort to help the parents/caregivers understand positive and\nhealthy ways of being a support for the child. Progress of the plan will be evaluated\nduring weekly team meetings and in individual therapy sessions between the therapist\nand youth.\nThe treatment program will utilize the Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\n(TFCBT) modality. This modality has a focus on “addressing the multiple domains of\ntrauma impact including but not limited to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),\ndepression, anxiety, externalizing behavior problems, relationship and attachment\nproblems, school problems and cognitive problems. TFCBT includes skills for regulating\naffect, behavior, thoughts and relationships, trauma processing, and enhancing safety,\ntrust, parenting skills and family communication”.\nLet’s Talk About It Girls’ Home III treatment team consists of highly trained\nprofessionals with skills in treatment plan development, de-escalation techniques, crisis\nintervention, and skills development for the youth. Staffing consists of Licensed Master\nlevel clinicians, Social Workers and Youth Services Specialists. Each of the treatment\nstaff are required to attend significant training on different interventions and methods of\npositive interventions. The staff will be provided training in de-escalation techniques,\nnon-physical intervention methods and physical intervention techniques. Oversight to\nthe levels of staff is provided, and team meetings support a strong team approach to\nproviding services to the youth. Each youth’s progress will be evaluation during the\nweekly team meetings with staff’s input. Staff is supervised by the administrative team\non all three shifts and the administrative team provides schedules, direction, and\nsupport by telephone or in person. The administrative team will randomly review video\nrecords to ensure that staff are following though appropriately in their interactions with\nthe residents.\nAdditional services and supervision involve the following: Staff with provide direct\nsupervision for residents as outlined in the contract and licensing rules. Supervision of\nresidents will also be determined by the needs of the residents. Youth in the program\n5",
    "will receive meals and snacks based on their nutritional needs. They will be provided\nmedical care which involves an initial medical physical and dental examination. They\nwill be provided updated immunizations and any necessary emergency medical care. If\na resident is on a regiment of medication, this will continue as prescribed and all\nmedication will be closely monitored and documented. A medication review will occur\nevery one to three months as needed. The facility describes further additional services:\nWe provide hands on independent living skills training, service plans/\ntreatment planning, group counseling, individual counseling, family\ncounseling, psychotropic medication management/ education, crisis\nintervention, development of discharge plans, aftercare, family team\nmeeting, coordination of medical treatment, mentoring, community\nactivities, community referrals/ collaboration with community agencies,\ncoordination of employment in the community, coordination of drivers\ntraining in the community, assessments to identify changing needs of\nyouth. Activities are scheduled daily for the youth in the home and in the\ncommunity (i.e. movies, skating, banking, apartment searching, budgeting,\nYMCA, Urban Zone Community Center, WMU activities, how to access\ncommunity resources/ location and instruction, community service,\nemployment searching, use of the public transit system, and price\ncomparisons/ local stores).\nBehavior management consists of staff using verbal de-escalation techniques. They will\nuse the following seven techniques while attempting to avoid physical intervention:\n Calm yourself before interaction with the person\n Becoming aware of your situation is also critically important.\n Try to look as non-threatening as possible\n Make a personal connection.\n Listening to the persons concerns.\n Shift the conversation to the future.\n Get them to say yes.\nStaff are trained in the Safety-Care curriculum for behavior management that might\ninvolve physical intervention. This involves a focus on prevention and de-escalation of\nbehavioral incident prior to any physical intervention. Staff are trained to provide\npowerful, non-coercive ways to prevent crises and teach desirable, functional alternative\nto dangerous and disruptive behavior. Some of the principles with this technique are\nrespect, dignity, avoidance of coercion, and the use of the least restrictive interventions\nthat are safe and effective. Each staff member will be fully trained in the Safety-Care\nbehavior management techniques prior to any physical intervention with a resident.\nDischarge from the program will occur when a youth meets the criteria outlined in their\ntreatment plan. Planning for discharge will begin at the time of the intake. Discharge\nplanning will involve the treatment team, referral source and the youth with a focus on\nappropriate aftercare planning. The program will provide aftercare follow up to ensure\nthe youth is successful in their aftercare.\n6",
