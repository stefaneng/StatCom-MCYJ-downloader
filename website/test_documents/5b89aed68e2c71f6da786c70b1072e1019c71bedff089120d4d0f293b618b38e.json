I encouraged her to go to a teen\nhealth center, but I did not tell her foster mother.”\nOn 5/1/24 I notified Chief Administrator that an investigation was\nin progress pertaining to the supervision of Youth A when she was\nat the facility, and I would share more information once I had it.\n2",
    "On 5/2/24 I notified Youth A’s PAFC Worker that I was assigned\nto investigate possible inadequate supervision at Safehaus Too\nbased on Youth A’s disclosure. I asked PAFC Worker to inform\nYouth A’s foster mother about what allegedly took place at\nSafehaus Too.\nOn 5/3/24 PAFC Worker emailed indicating she informed the\nfoster mother. I attempted to arrange to interview Youth A at the\nprivate foster care agency. However, transportation for her could\nnot be arranged. PAFC Worker indicated Youth A would be\nattending Adams Middle School in Westland on 5/7/24.\nI interviewed Former Youth A at school on 5/7/24. Prior to the\ninterview, I clarified that Youth A was not in any trouble and I was\nonly there to find out about how she was supervised at Safehaus.\nYouth A confirmed that she resided at Safehaus from 4/10/24 –\n4/23/24 but said she could not recall any of the names of the staff.\nI asked her if there were any boys at the facility. She said there\nwas one but she did not know his name. I asked Youth A if she\nand a boy had sexual contact at Safehaus. Her eyes widened and\nshe demanded, “Who said that?” I reiterated I was there to make\nsure the staff are supervising the youth at Safehaus. She said the\nstaff there do supervise the youths and “never leave us alone.”\nYouth A became angry and focused on who may have told. She\ninsisted, “I’m not telling you nothing. That’s a lie. I’m not telling\nyou cuz I didn’t do it with no boy…It didn’t happen. No. You’re\ngoing to go to his school and ask him. I’m not doing this. Who\ntold you that? Oh, it was probably that youth worker. What a\nfuckin’ snitch, man.” She became tearful and stormed out of the\nroom.\nI attempted to interview Former Youth R with Government\nWorker by phone on 5/14/24 at his mothers phone number. His\nmother said Former Youth R was not staying with her and was\nunwilling or unable to provide a number where her son could be\nreached.\nGovernment Worker and I reached Former Youth R on 5/15/24.\nHe said he knew Former Youth A and they talked together.\nFormer Youth R denied sharing or trying to share a blanket with\nFormer Youth A. “There was one full fluffy blanket that we would\nall fight over. One staff told us not to sit close, but we were\nalready arms-length away.”\n3",
    "I arrived unannounced at Safehaus Too on 5/8/24 and met with\nChief Administrator (CA). I shared the allegations and gathered\nadditional information. CA indicated that Youth A and one male\nyouth, Former Youth R, age 14, were at the facility together from\n4/10/24 – 4/16/24.\nI interviewed Former Staff 1 on 5/9/24 by phone.

She denied ever leaving them alone together\nor being aware of or hearing rumors that they had sexual contact.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 5/9/24 by phone.

I wouldn’t\nallow that.”\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 5/9/24 by phone. He has worked at the\nfacility for three months. Staff 3 worked afternoon shift at\nSafehaus Too on 4/12/24 and 4/16/24.

She has worked at the\nfacility for two weeks. Staff 4 worked afternoon shift on 4/14/24\nand remembered both youths. “I could not say they were close. I\ndid not see blanket sharing during my shift. I saw nothing\ninappropriate between them.”\nStaff 5 worked afternoon shift at the facility on 4/13/24 and\n4/16/24. I attempted to reach Staff 5 twice on 5/9/24 to interview\nhim. He did not answer or return my calls.\nI interviewed Staff 6 on 5/9/24 by phone. She has worked at the\nfacility for 11 days and worked afternoon shift on 4/15/24. During\nshift change, Staff 6 recalled being warned to keep a close eye on\nYouth A and Youth R as there were rumors from other unidentified\nyouths that they had had sexual contact. Staff 6 remembered\n4",
    "both youths and described them as “a little cozy.” “I kept having to\nseparate them and remind them of boundaries. I did not witness\nany touching, but I believe they would have had I not been\nsupervising.” Staff 6 said Youth A and Youth R were sitting in\nchairs watching television and threw a blanket over themselves. “I\nseparated them, they questioned why and said they weren’t doing\nanything…I told them to get up for an activity and they gave me a\nhard time. They tried sharing a blanket a couple more times, then\nagreed not to sit next to each other. I had Youth A sit by me.\nFormer Staff 1 turned off the lights for “movie time” at 9pm. It was\nrumored Youth A and Youth R liked each other.” Later Staff 6\nheard unidentified youths saying that Former Staff 1 was aware\nthere had been sexual contact between the two youths. Staff 6\nwas adamant “They didn’t touch each other while I was there.”\nI interviewed Staff 7 on 5/9/24 by phone. She has worked at the\nfacility for five months and worked afternoon shift on 4/16/24.\nStaff 7 remembered both youths and said Youth A was “always\nthe center of attention.” “I could see Youth A liked Youth R…The\ngirls act differently when there’s a boy in the house…I never saw a\nblanket over them...They were not left in a room together without\nstaff when I was there…I didn’t hear any rumors about them.”\nI attempted to interview Staff 8 with Government Worker by phone\non 5/14/24 via phone. A voice message was left. I interviewed\nStaff 8 with Government Worker on 5/15/24. She works midnight\nshift, remembered Youth A, never saw her close to Youth R and\nsaid, “No one was under blankets.”\nAnalysis Youth A stated that staff were always in the room with them when\nthe youths were awake. All afternoon staff interviewed denied\nleaving Youth A and Youth R alone together in a room.\nThere is no evidence Youth A and Youth R were left unsupervised\non afternoon shift.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Staff to resident ratio\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nDescription supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\n5",

    "Investigation On 5/10/24 I received this additional allegation assigned as a joint\ninvestigation with Government Worker.\nSafehaus Too is a four-bed non-secure short-term co-ed facility\nthat does not contract with MDHHS and does not have video\ncameras inside the residential home.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Wayne County Integrated Health staff by phone on\n5/10/24.
