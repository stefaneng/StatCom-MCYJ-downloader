TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:.\n• R400.12708 Child assessment: A discussion was had with the agency\nrelated to domestic adoptive placements, and ensuring for whatever\navailable child/birth parent history; that may exist; and if there is none,\ndocumenting why it does not exist.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Social work contacts: The agency was advised that ensuring that\nworkers are consistently documentation quality home visits in their social\nwork contacts could aid them in clearly showing their efforts with the child\nand families.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod:\nThe first incident related to an allegation that the foster parent pushed the child off\nthe porch after they had gotten into an argument. The special evaluation showed\nthe foster mother was pushing the child in a chair toward the door in an attempt to\nget the child through the door and outside. The child denied being push off the\nporch; said he stumble off of it. The worker was unable to determine if that was the\ncase or if what occurred was an unintentionally push by the foster parent; but once\nthe child was outside the foster parent locked the child outside. The special\nevaluation assessed that both parties were frustrated with one another, and that the\nfoster parent’s response was not trauma-responsive; nor sensitive to the child’s\nemotional needs at the time. The foster home was found in violation of the\nbehavior management rules. A corrective action plan for the foster parent included\ntrauma responsive training, learning to utilize alternative parenting techniques; and\nreaching out to workers for help when frustrated.\nThe second incident related to an allegation that foster parent grabbed and squoze\nthe child’s arm and yelled in the child’s face. During the special evaluation the foster\nparent admitted to grabbing the child’s arm so as to get the child’s attention, not to\ncause harm to the child. The foster parent also admitted to yelling at the child. The\n8",
    "foster home was found in violation with the foster home’s behavior management\nrule. A corrective action plan was developed with the foster family that included the\nfoster parent learning new parenting techniques to use with the child, learning\ntechniques on how to lower their frustrations; and the foster family was referred to a\nfoster care navigator for assistance.\nIn both of these special evaluations, the agency adhered to departmental\ntimeframes and rules.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan during this\nlicensing period:\nThe corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024 Renewal inspection where\nit received 15 rule and policy violations.\nDuring this current Interim inspection, the agency received 16 rule violations. This\nwas an increase of one from the previously stated last inspection. Of these 16\ncitations, 7 are repeat violations within the last two years (4 are specific repeats\nviolations from the 2024 Renewal inspection). The agency’s CAP compliance\naround these 4 rule violations is as follows: the number of individual cases cited\nremained the same with respect to 3 rule violations cited; and the number of\nindividual cases cited with respect to the last rule violation decreased from 2 of 8\nto 1 of 8.\nThe agency reported despite continued staffing losses it continued to work on its\ncorrective action plan, and towards compliance in all areas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s (CA) report dated 10/31/2024. The\nCA indicated the agency has experienced numerous staff turnover, ranging from\ntheir program director to direct foster care staff. The agency reported\nnotwithstanding these staffing issues it has maintained a focus on safety, and it\nhas become adept at finding ways to sustain and maintain its foster care\ndepartment. It has various dually trained staff; and supervisors have been able to\ncarry cases so as to take burdens off workers. The CA reported new staff are\nprovided a mentor to aid them; and this has proven beneficial. The agency also\nreported they are nearly fully staffed, and the installation of their new program\nmanager has aided them with staffing, in gaining stability and enhancing key\nperformance indicators (KPI).\nThe agency further reported they have implemented their corrective action plan;\nand they continue to monitor and gauge its progress by way of quarterly audits\nand monthly manager meetings. The agency plans to continue its efforts so as to\npromote compliance in all areas.\n9",
    "Financial Overview\nThe agency provided a 2024 annual budget, 2025 projected budget; and its most\nrecent independent financial audit for the year ended 12/31/2023. A review of\nboth documents did not reveal any concerns at this time.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, foster care program\nmanager; manager/domestic adoption supervisor, licensing supervisor; and\nadoption supervisor during the Entrance conference and Exit conference; I\ninterviewed, a licensing worker; domestic adoption/state ward adoption worker,\nfoster care worker, a state ward adoption worker; and foster care supervisor. The\nstaff interviewed reported feeling supported, appreciated and kept informed on\nmatters affecting their roles, and what’s required related to the things the agency\nmust do to correct noncompliance areas. These staff listed the agency’s strengths\nas its dedicated supervisors, the support by management; the chief administrator\nbeing hands on, and a strong advocate for staff; and the size of the agency\n(allowing its staff to be close and like a family). Areas of growth needed included,\nmore contact by licensing department with foster care department in the office;\nestablishing clearer protocols for emergency placements; more social media\npresence to recruit teen foster homes; staff stability/ finding more ways to retain\nworkers; more discussion about pay raises; and continuing to develop ways to\nkeep the departments working together and functioning as a total team.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency's site did not reveal any concerns or safety issues.\nThe agency has sufficient space and equipment for its staff, and records are safely\nstored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one safety alert during this licensing period, which was received on\n9/11/2024.\nConcern:\nThe Division of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL) Analyst reported she was unable to\nverify the safety of the child and home because the foster parent backed out of two\nseparate rescheduled home visits, 8/26/2024 and 9/11/2024. The foster parent then\nreported she did not want to participate in the audit.\nResolution:\nThe agency made a home visit to the foster home on 9/12/2024 and verified the\nsafety of the child and the home. The agency provided a copy of the home visit\nsheet it utilized to conduct this home visit. It also provided a copy of a 7/15/2024\nletter it had sent to the foster parent advising them of their random selection, and the\nneed for their participation with the DWCL Analyst/the audit review.\n10",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJanuary 27, 2025\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 6, 2025\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n11"
