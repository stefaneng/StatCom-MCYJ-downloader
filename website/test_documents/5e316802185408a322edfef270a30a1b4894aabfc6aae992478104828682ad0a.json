    "INVESTIGATION:\nOn 8/12/2020 I received an online complaint allegation that Staff 1 was bitten by\nResident A. When bitten, Staff 1 jumped up and extended her arm, pushing\nResident A to the floor. Resident A was checked for marks and none were found.\nInterviews\nOn 8/12/2020 I sent an email to DHHS Worker 1 to inform her of the investigation.\nShe informed me that Resident A is mostly non-verbal and wouldn’t be able to tell\nme about the incident.\nOn 8/17/2020 I made an unannounced visit to the facility and explained the\ninvestigation allegations to the Chief Administrator. Chief Administrator stated that\nshe was aware of the incident and stated that she has had no other issues or\nconcerns with Staff 1. While at the facility, I interviewed Staff 1 who reported that, on\n8/9/2020, she was eating her dinner on a couch in the milieu area. Resident A was\nupset and swearing because he wanted Staff 1 to put him to bed even though she\nwasn’t his primary staff that day, so he kneeled on the floor by Staff 1 and bit her\nshin area. Staff 1 responded by immediately pulling her leg back and extending her\nright arm to “put space” between them. When she extended her arm, she made\ncontact with Resident A. He fell backward and started yelling at Staff 1 for pushing\nhim. Staff 1 stated that she is unsure if she pushed Resident A or if he was being\ndramatic, as he often is with her. Staff 1 stated that she checked Resident A and\ndidn’t see any bruising or injuries, talked to him about what happened, then put him\nto bed.\nAfter interviewing Staff 1, I observed Resident A in his bedroom getting ready for his\nday.\nOn 8/24/2020 I interviewed Staff 2 and Staff 3 by phone. Staff 2 reported that she\nsaw Resident A run up and bite Staff 1 on the leg and Staff 1, without even looking\nat Resident A, pushed him away. Staff 2 stated that it looked like an automatic\nresponse and that Staff 1 didn’t intend to push Resident A down. She stated that\nResident A then “flopped” on the floor “dramatically” and called Staff 1 names. Staff\n2 reported that the staff are trained to initiate a bite release if a resident latches on,\nbut this bite didn’t look that hard. Staff 3 stated that she was working at the time of\nthe incident but did not see the bite or push.\nDocuments Reviewed\nOn 8/12/2020 I received an incident report dated 8/10/2020, which was written by\nStaff 1 and documented the details of the incident as provided in her interview.\nOn 8/17/2020 I received and reviewed the Satori study guide section regarding bite\nprotection procedures.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that describe the\ninstitution’s behavior management system. The\npolicies and procedures shall be reviewed annually\nand updated as needed. These shall be available to\nall residents, their families, and referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 did not follow the policies and procedures regarding\nbehavior management when she extended her arm and pushed\na resident who had bitten her.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nAgency policies and procedures regarding incident reporting were not followed.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews\nOn 8/12/2020 I sent an email to DHHS Worker 1 to inform her of an investigation\nregarding Resident A. She replied on 8/13/2020 stating that she was not notified of\nthe incident by the facility staff.\nOn 8/17/2020 I interviewed Staff 1 in person. She reported that she has worked at\nthe facility for 14 years and hasn’t filled out an incident report in the last 7 years. She\nstated that she must have just forgotten to notify the worker of the incident.\nDocuments Reviewed\nOn 8/12/2020 I received and reviewed an Incident Report (IR) written by Staff 1 on\n8/10/2020. According to the IR, the incident took place on 8/9/2020. The section of\nthe report in which notification to the resident’s caseworker is to be documented was\nblank.\nOn 8/17/2020 I received and reviewed a copy of the facility’s incident reporting policy\nwhich states that incident reports are to be completed prior to the end of the shift\nduring which the incident occurred. I also received and reviewed the incident\nreporting requirement policy which states that any diversion from the approved\nbehavior management technique must be reported.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 did not follow the established policies and procedures\nregarding incident reporting when she failed to complete an\nincident report prior to the end of the shift during which it\noccurred and forgetting to notify the resident’s assigned\ncaseworker.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV.
