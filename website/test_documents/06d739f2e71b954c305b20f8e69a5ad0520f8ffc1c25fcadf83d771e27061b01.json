CA reported she did not have any further information\nabout the allegations. CA reported Staff 1 was suspended pending\nthis investigation.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/31/24.\nYouth A reported on 5/24/24, Staff 1 took Youth A and Youth B to\na movie theater. Towards the end of the movie, Youth A reported\nStaff 1 stepped out of the movie and took an important call. Youth\nA reported approximately 15 minutes later, Staff 1 returned to the\nmovie, and then they left the theater. Youth A reported she didn’t\nhave any concerns about the situation, but thought it was odd\nbecause she’s been on many other outings and staff have never\nleft youth alone.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/31/24.\nYouth B reported Staff 1 took Youth A and Youth B to the movie\ntheater on 5/24/24. Youth B reported when they were in the car on\nthe way to the theater, Staff 1 received a text message. When\nthey arrived at the theater, Staff 1 told Youth A and Youth B she\nhad a personal emergency phone call she would have to take\nduring the movie, and she would have to step out. Youth B\nreported Staff 1 asked him to keep an eye on Youth A when she\nstepped out because Youth A has previously gone AWOL from an\nouting. Youth B reported Staff 1 asked him to come get her if\nYouth A moved or tried to leave. Youth B reported Staff 1 stepped\nout of the movie for approximately 15 minutes. Youth B reported\nhe has been on other outings and staff have never left him or any\nother youth alone before.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 5/31/24.\nStaff 1 reported when she was in the car with Youth A and Youth\nB on the way to the movie theater, she received a text message\nfrom a family member. Staff 1 reported the family member told her\nshe was going to be in an upcoming potentially unsafe situation\nand wanted Staff 1 to be on the phone with them to hear what was\nhappening. Staff 1 reported she, Youth A and Youth B were\nseated in the middle aisle in the movie, which leads to the exit.\n2",
    "Staff 1 reported when she received the phone call, she told Youth\nA and Youth B she needed to take a call and would be right back.\nStaff 1 reported she asked Youth B to keep an eye on Youth A\nsince Youth A was higher risk for AWOL. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nand Youth B were separated by one seat in between them. Staff 1\nreported since she was listening, but not talking on the phone call,\nshe didn’t fully exit to the movie. Staff 1 reported she was on the\nother side of the wall leading toward the exit, so she peaked\naround to check on Youth A and Youth B but did not watch them\nconstantly. Staff 1 reported she was on the phone call for\napproximately 10 minutes. Staff 1 reported she had to take the call\nbecause it was an emergency, and she felt she accounted for\nevery possible scenario that could happen to avoid something like\nthis investigation occurring. Staff 1 reported she regrets agreeing\nto take the call now, but at the time, she did not feel it was that\nserious.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Activity Treatment – Residential Staff Expectations policy\nstates staff are expected to make certain there is no\nunsupervised interaction among youth while attending\nactivities.\n• Staff Ratio Policy states direct care staff are required to\nalways maintain line-of-sight supervision of youth except\nwhen youth are in their individual sleeping rooms or\nbathroom.\n• Truancy and Missing Persons Policy states to prevent\nAWOL, staff will avoid allowing youth to remain out of their\nimmediate sight lines.\n• Staff 1 has one disciplinary action in the form of a growth\nplan in her employee file, which is unrelated to this\ninvestigation. Staff 1 received training on policies related to\nsupervision of youth during orientation in July 2023.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per interviews\nconducted and documentation reviewed, Staff 1 did not follow the\nfacility’s policies regarding supervision of youth.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTechnical assistance was offered for the facility to remind staff it is\nnot appropriate to request a youth watch/supervise another youth.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2023C0000002 dated 12/5/22; CAP approved 12/22/22\nSIR #2023C0000274 dated 5/1/23; CAP approved 5/26/23\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJuly 1, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 8, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
