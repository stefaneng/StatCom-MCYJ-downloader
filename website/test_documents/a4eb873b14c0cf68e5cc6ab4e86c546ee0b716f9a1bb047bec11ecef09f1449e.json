    "documentation of the accurate quarterly reporting period, and the date of the\nquarterly face to face home visit with the child and family.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere wasone incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. The incident related to an allegation that the foster father hit his foster son’s\nhand because the child took the child’s brother’s Uno cards. Also, that the foster\nmother pushed the child at the park. During the investigation the foster parent\nadmitted to tapping the child’s hand during the Uno incident. The foster mother\ndenied the allegation about the push, and there was insufficient evidence to show\nthat occurred. The foster home was found in violation of the behavior management\nrule, and a corrective action plan was developed with the family, which entailed the\nfoster parents re-reviewing policy and resigning the agency’s discipline policy. The\nagency adhered to departmental timeframes and requirements related to this\nspecial evaluations.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency submitted two corrective action plans not related to maltreatment\nduring the inspection period.\nThe first corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2023 Renewal inspection\nwhere they received the following rule violations:\n• R400.12327(5)(d) Special evaluation.\n• R400.12405 (5) (a) &(b)Change of placement.\n• R400.12413 (1) (c)(ii) Medical and dental policy.\n• R400.12418(2)(a) & (b) Development of Service Plans.\n• R400.12419(1)(c) Initial Service Plans.\n• R400.12421(a) Visitation and parenting time.\n• R400.12607(4) Agency recommendation.\n• MISEP 4.22 Child Welfare Information System (Commitment 22)\n• MISEP 6.19(c) Assessments and Service Plans, Content (commitment 69)\n• FOM 722-6b Family Team Meeting.\n• FOM 722-8- Case Service Plans-Overview, Types & Timeframes-Supervisory\nApproval.\n• FOM 722-8 D Treatment Plans-Agreements & Signatures\n• FOM 722-8-E Foster Care/Juvenile Justice Action Summary.\n• FOM 801- C Medial Passport.\n• FOM 802 Mental Health and Behavioral and Developmental Need of Children\nunder Supervision o MDHHS,\nThe agency received three repeat violations this inspection. Notwithstanding that,\nor its continued staff turnover, which also included administrative changes for chief\noperating officer and chief executive officer, the agency made significant progress\n6",
    "on this corrective action plan. It provided information showing efforts to remind\nfoster care, adoption, and licensing workers of timeframes and due dates,\nutilization of outlook calendars for such purposes; tools to review case records for\ncompliance, and completion of various training (i.e. family team meetings, closing\naction summaries). The agency also held meetings, discussions, on the corrective\naction plan, as verified, and also affirmed by the staff interviewed. The file reviews\nalso showed observation of various tools, checklists and efforts being utilized to\naid staff in program rule compliance.\nThe agency’s second corrective action plan related to special investigation\n2024C0000896SI, for a complaint received on11/3/2023. The allegation was that\na foster parent abruptly dropped a foster child’s belonging off without providing a\n14-day notice; and the agency did not initiate a special evaluation against the\nfoster parent. Additionally, that the agency placed an intensive needs child into a\nnew inexperienced foster family home who had no adequate training and was\nlicensed less than six months. The agency was not found in violation of the first\nallegation; but was with respect to the second. The agency was cited for\nR400.12325 related to Agency recommendation for not adequately documenting\nits rationale for recommending several high need services type children for this\nfoster home, given the homes lack of completed training and personal experience.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan, which was approved\n12/15/2023. The agency reported it would conduct a Team’s training for staff on\nthe license service type utilizing the technical assistance manual by 1/4/2024.\nAdditionally, supervisors will review foster home licensing assessment’s, service\ntype and recommendation for placement and compare that with what’s is\ndocumented in the CWLM (Child Welfare Licensing Module) system. This review\nis to ensure for the appropriate service types, and the child’s need so as to\ndetermine the suitability of a potential placement. New home study checklists and\nAnnual study checklists will also be used to help gauge intake and licensing\nworkers in making these determination and the review of such. Proof of these\nchecklists was provided during the onsite visit for this Interim inspection on\n2/13/2024; along with proof of License Service Type training completed for staff\nvia PowerPoint. The agency also provided sample emails showing how it is\nexploring placement suitability of a foster home for children prior to giving approval\nfor the placement. The agency appears to be complying with this corrective action\nplan.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator (CA)provided an annual chief administrator's report dated\n10/3/2023 for 10/1/2022-9/30/2023 which was completed per the requirement rule\nand did not show any notable areas of concern.\nThe CA reported barriers or systemic factors that impacted the agency’s\ncompliance to rule/policy included, delays in data entry from child welfare foster\ncare/the department of health and human services (DHHS) staff, delays with title-\nIVE case reads, delays in assignment of cases in MISACWIS, all necessary\ninformation not moving onto permanent wards cases from temporary ones, and\n7",
    "YAVFC eligibility discrepancies between the local DHHS office and policy office;\nas well as spreadsheet sent by multiple DHHS entities at various times each\nmonth the need responses. The CA believes the agency’s 2023 CAP had some\nimpact on the agency’s overall non-compliance; and that the agency saw\nimprovements in a number of key performance indicator areas, inclusive of fac-to-\nface contacts, initial and updated service plan timeliness from workers and\nsupervisors.\nThe CA reported the agency had both administrative and line staff turnover; and\nhas worked to fill all positions. The CA reported the agency will continue to use the\nMMR (Monthly Management Record) and BOB (Book of Business) on an\nindividual staff basis, as well as, on a larger compliance basis to ensure the\nagency is meeting the KPI standards. Additionally, that these standards and CAP\ncompliance will be shared with staff at twice monthly staff meetings; and checklists\nand case file reviews are being utilized to ensure compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a 10/1/2023- 9/30/2024 consolidated budget, 2024\npreliminary budget, and an independent financial audit for 2023. A review of the\ndocuments did not show any specific areas of concern.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, the licensing\ndesignee/program officer; and three other administrative/managerial staff, one\nsupervisor, one foster care/adoption worker, one licensing worker, and one foster\ncare worker was interviewed. The staff reported positives about the agency’s\nability to cater to its employees’ strengths, teamwork, putting children first, and the\nagency’s willingness to fill in financial gaps to meet children and family needs\nwhen program services are unable to fulfill that need. Additionally, the agency’s\nawareness of salary lapses and its recent willingness to explore salary upgrades\nwas also noted. Areas of concern or needs for growth reported by staff related to a\nneed to continue working on staff retention and salary increases.\nOne independent living youth was interviewed, and the youth reported being\nhelped by the agency. Aside from wishing the worker would always have an\nanswer to questions upfront, no concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility did not reveal any safety issues or concerns.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one safety alert, which was received on 1/11/2024:\nConcern:\nThe foster parents did not respond to several attempts by the DCWL (Division of\nChild Welfare Licensing) Analyst to schedule a visit in the home for the annual audit.\n8",
    "The safety of the home was not able to be assessed due to the foster parents not\nresponding.\nResolution:\nThe agency contacted the foster father on 1/11/2024 and he reported frustration with\nhaving been selected for a home visit because he had been selected in a prior year.\nThe agency advised the foster parent of his and his wife’s responsibility to\nparticipate in this progress and to contact the DCWL Analyst. A foster home\nassessment visit occurred at the foster home by the agency’s licensing worker on\n1/11/2024 around 5:30pm. The home was observed to be tidy, and there were no\nsafety concerns noted. The smoke and carbon monoxide detectors were operable,\nthere were adequate sleeping arrangements, and there were no observable hazards\nin the home or yard.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMarch 11, 2024\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 19, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n9"
