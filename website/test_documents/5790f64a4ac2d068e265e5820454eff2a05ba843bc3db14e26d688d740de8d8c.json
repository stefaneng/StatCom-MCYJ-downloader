    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\n• Renewal evaluation dated 1/25/24, CAP approved 1/25/24. One violation\nwas found regarding employee records. Nine staff did not have timely\nperformance evaluations. The agency implemented the CAP successfully\nand has not had any repeat violations.\n• Special investigation 2024SIC0001560 completed on 9/25/24, CAP\napproved 10/10/24. The agency had two violations: rule 158, due to staff\nusing humiliating language toward a youth and rule 109 due to staff using\ntheir cell phone to make personal calls in front of youth. The agency CAP\nwas implemented and will continue to be monitored by DCWL through\nApril 2025. At this time, there are no repeat violations or additional\nconcerns in these areas.\n• Special investigation 2025SIC0000024 completed on 11/26/24, CAP\napproved 1/8/25. The agency had two violations: rule 159 due to staff\nusing a restraint technique that did not follow the approved procedures\nand rule 112 for staff observing the improper restraint and not intervening\nto correct it. The agency CAP is in the process of being implemented and\nwill continue to be monitored by DCWL through July 2025.\nFinancial Overview\nThe financial audit for 2024 has not been completed at this time. However, the\nagency provided the 2023 audit and 2024/2025 budgets. No financial concerns\nwere identified.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) Assessment dated 1/3/25 was reviewed and\ndiscussed. The CA reported the CAPs have been implemented regarding the 2024\nrenewal and two special investigations. The CAPs included additional training for\nstaff, counseling and termination of staff, the purchase of cell phone lockers, and\nreview of agency policy. The CA stated there were no barriers associated with\nimplementing the CAPs and it is anticipated compliance will be achieved. The\nfacility had one unplanned discharge during this review period. The discharge\noccurred due to the youth being placed in an inpatient hospital setting that could\nbetter address their mental health needs.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. Both staff reported they enjoy their jobs, but\nacknowledged it is difficult at times. Staff stated that the youth sometimes have\nvery challenging behaviors and seem disinterested in making progress on their\ngoals. Staff reported they continue to try to be positive role models and encourage\nyouth to make good choices that will lead to a successful future. Staff also reported\nstruggling with working multiple double shifts or mandated overtime. However, that\nhas improved recently with an influx of new employees. Staff stated their\n4",
    "supervisors are very knowledgeable and supportive. Staff did not identify any\nneeds at this time.\nThree youth were interviewed on-site. Youth reported they feel safe with staff at the\nfacility and have someone they could talk to if there were problems. However,\nsome of their peer’s behavior makes them feel unsafe at times. Youth reported they\nhave adequate clothing and bedding. Two of the youth reported they do not like the\nfood at the facility and are not always given alternatives if the meal is something\nthey do not like or cannot have. This concern is currently being addressed in\nspecial investigation 2025SIC0000226. No other concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe facility was observed to be clean and appropriately furnished. Medication was\nproperly stored in a locked cabinet, in a locked room. Youth had seasonally\nappropriate bedding and access to clothing and hygiene items. However, the\noverall condition of the building has declined in recent weeks due to destructive\nbehavior by three youth. The youth kicked holes in walls, broke windows, broke\ndoors, and peeled paint and trim from several locations. Maintenance continues to\nmake repairs but has had difficulty keeping up with the destruction by the youth.\nThe Chief Administrator reported they are in the process of purchasing windows\nthat are more shatter resistant, and an anti-ligature wall covering to prevent further\ndamage by youth. Progress on the repairs will be evaluated during the next\nquarterly unannounced on-site visit.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_ _____________January 13, 2025_______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 22, 2025\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n5"
