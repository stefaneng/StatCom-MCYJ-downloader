A plan of\nfinancing must include all the following:\n• (e) An audit of all financial accounts\nconducted annually by an independent\ncertified public accountant not\nadministratively related to the agency. A\ncopy of the audit shall be available to the\ndepartment upon request.\nThe financial information submitted was a financial statement completed and\nreviewed by a CPA firm that indicated the agency is currently in good standing\nand maintains compliance with all applicable financial and regulatory\nrequirements, but it was not adequate to meet the standards required to be\nconsidered an audit consistent with the rule.",

No CAP was needed so\nthere was no review of action steps required. The assessment included an\nevaluation/analysis of a disrupted adoption that occurred.\nFinancial Overview\nI reviewed the financial audit/budget. The financial statement review that was\nsubmitted did not meet the requirements of an audit. However, it noted the\nagency is in good standing.\nStaff Interviews\nStaff participated in the entrance conference. Staff interviews did not indicate any\nareas of concern.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of adoption services. All files were stored securely and there is a cross\nshredder for CHRI.",

RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n_____________________________________07/15/2025\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 17, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
