EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "There were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod:\nThe first incident related to an allegation that the foster parents were hitting the\nchild, and the child had bruises on her knees. During the special evaluation the\nchild and foster parents denied the allegations. The child reported getting the\nbruising to her knees while playing and falling down. The foster parent was found in\nnoncompliance with the foster home behavior management rule because during the\ninvestigation the foster father reported that he has pinched the child in the past\nwhen she has gotten out of her car seat when he was driving. A corrective action\nplan was completed with the foster parents around them taking training on the use\nof nonphysical discipline, them explaining what they learned and what they will do\ndifferently.\nThe second incident related to an allegation that the foster parent sprays the foster\nchild with a squirt bottle, as discipline when the child lies. During the special evaluation\nthe foster mother and child reported the foster mother sprayed the child with water\nfrom a squirt bottle for lying about getting in trouble in school. The foster mother\nadmitted to spraying the child twice. The foster home was found in violation of the\nfoster home behavior management rule. A corrective action plan was completed with\nthe foster parents that included a review of trauma assessments, discussion with the\nfoster parentsaround proper forms of discipline and on behavior expectations;\ndiscipline strategies; utilizing available supports, such as the parents calling agency\nstaff and other care providers for support.\nThe agency appeared to have acted appropriately related to both special\nevaluations and it adhered to departmental timeframes and requirements related to\nthese special evaluations.",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans during this\nlicensing period:\nThe first corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024 Interim inspection\nwhere it received 6 rule violations.\nDuring this current inspection for the agency’s renewal license, the agency\nreceived 12 rule violations. This number is an increase from the agency’s 2024\ninspection. Of the 12 citations, 4 are repeat violations within the last two years.\nOnly 1 is a specific repeat violation from the inspection in 2024. The agency’s\ncorrective action plan compliance around this 1 rule violation, is as follows: the\nnumber of individual cases cited deceased from 4 of 8 to 2 of 8.\nNotwithstanding the increase in citations this inspection, this inspection’s review\nshowed a very low number of repeat violations. The agency has implemented and\nis adhering to its interim inspection corrective action plan. The agency reported it\nis focusing on its key performance indicators (KPI) and it continues its efforts to\nimprove compliance with all rules and policies.\nThe second corrective action plan related to Special Investigation\n2024SIC0001508, related to a complaint received on 6/13/2024. The complaint\nalleged that in April 2023, the agency completed a special evaluation on a foster\nhome and established willful and substantial violations yet recommended a\ncorrective action plan. The special investigation found the agency in violation of\nrule R 400.14325 (1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nappropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained in the foster home\nevaluation and any special evaluations. An acceptable corrective action plan was\nsubmitted, that indicated team training on the process of special evaluations; that\nduring the special evaluation/prior to its completion, a meeting will occur with staff\nassociated with the foster home to review the findings of the special evaluation,\nand the foster home’s current licensing characteristics; and that the agency would\nmake an assessment to determine if any characteristics or licensing modification\nare needed.\nThe agency has implemented its corrective plan related to the stated special\ninvestigation and are in compliance with it.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s report dated 12/2/2024. The chief\nadministrator’s report indicated the agency has found improvements in all the\nareas it was found in noncompliance at the last inspection. The agency attributed\nthis improvement to their tracking systems, reminders to staff of various due dates,",
    "and use of DocuSign to obtain various needed signatures. Also as alluded to prior\nin this report, the agency reported it has been focusing on its KPI areas. As it\nrelates to those KPI compliance areas, the agency has been in collaboration with\ndepartment so as to aid in perhaps seeing what they may be missing in some\ncompliance areas. The chief administrator/agency also reported that staff turnover\nin foster care, adoption, licensing and clerical has impacted their compliance in\nsome areas. Other barriers the agency reported as impacting compliance included\ndelays in data entry from departmental staff in MISACWIS, delays in IV-E case\nreads, delays by the department related to case assignments and permanent\nwarship status changes. The agency reported notwithstanding these issues they\ncontinue their efforts to improve compliance and keep their staff informed.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a copy of its October 1, 2024, to September 30,2025 budget,\nand its most recent independent financial audit for 9/30/2023. A review of these\ndocuments did not indicate any concerns.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with agency's licensee designee and four other agency\nadministrative staff, a foster care supervisor, Licensing supervisor, licensing\nworker, foster care worker, and adoption worker/foster worker were interviewed.\nStaff interviewed reported the agency offers teamwork/team building; is supportive\nto its staff; is responsive to staff, children, and family’s needs; child safety comes\nfirst; all supervisors are available to any staff in times of need; and the agency is\norganized and guided by policies. Matters reported as areas for continued growth\nincluded: licensing staff and foster care staff maintaining communication with one\nanother; more DEI assistance; pay increases; continued facilitated times and\ninteractions between all program departments to enhance team work,\nunderstanding of roles and communication; and advocating for more access to\nresources for children and families.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nReview of the agency's office space did not reveal any areas of concern related to\nthe space, equipment, or file storage.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts this reporting period.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 24, 2025\n___________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 24, 2025\n_____________________________________\nRori-Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager"
