Youth A could not\nrecall the exact date, but she did remember that this Licensing\nconsultant was visiting the facility on the same date this occurred.\nIt was confirmed this was on 01/30/2024.

Staff 1 stated she was not sure what Staff 2 did with\nthat footage afterwards.\nYouth C was interviewed over the phone on 06/06/2024. She\nstated she was aware she was being recorded by Staff 1 during\nthe night in question. She knew this because she recalled asking\nhim why he had his phone out and he stated he was recording\nbecause other youth had broken the security cameras.

A youth can be heard in the background\nreferencing changing their clothes, but at no point did\nanyone change their clothes during the footage.\nAnalysis Through interviews with staff and documentation reviewed there\nwas evidence found that the confidentiality of youth placed in the\nprogram was broken due to Staff 1 recording them with his\npersonal phone.\nConsultation provided:\n• While it is a positive to have staff members working at the\nfacility who have worked in similar Child Caring Institution\nsettings, the program is advised to have clear discussions\nat the hire of new employees and in trainings about\nprogram specific policies and staff member’s need to avoid\nusing specific direction or procedure from past work\nexperiences.\n• Staff members are encouraged to refrain from using\nvocabulary such as “hissy fit” when describing the\nbehaviors of youth, as opposed to more trauma-informed\nvocabulary.\nConclusion Violation Established\n6",
