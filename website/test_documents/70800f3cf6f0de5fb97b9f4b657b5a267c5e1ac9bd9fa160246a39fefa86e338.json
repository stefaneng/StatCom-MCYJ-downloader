The allegation was reported to complainant by a source\nthat received the information second-hand. There were no\nwitnesses to the incident identified.\nComplainant was contacted by phone on 5/29/2024. Complainant\nreported they were informed Youth A had requested to have Staff\n1 added to her “call list” at her new placement in independent\nliving. When Complainant last saw Youth A, she had a phone and\n2",
    "reported she obtained it while placed at Vista Maria. However, she\ndid not disclose how she obtained it.\nIndependent Living (IL) Staff 1 was contacted by phone on\n5/29/2024 to ensure Youth A was available for an interview.\nAdditional contact occurred on 6/4/24, 6/12/24, 7/3/24 and 7/22/24\nvia email. IL Staff 1 verified that Youth A had a cell phone when\nshe arrived at the IL placement. Verification of Youth A’s cell\nphone bill was requested from IL Staff 1. However, as Youth A\nwas new to the placement, she had not yet completed a budget\nand had not provided a copy of her phone bill. On 7/3/21 a copy of\nYouth A’s budget was sent to DCWL, which indicated a payment\nof $96 for her cell phone. IL Staff 1 did not have copy of Youth A’s\nphone bill to verify whose name it was in.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at her IL placement on\n5/30/24. Youth A reported living at Vista Maria for approximately\nsix months, then recently moving to an IL placement. Youth A\nreported she does not keep in contact with any staff from Vista\nMaria except for her after care worker. Youth A verified that Staff 1\nwas not her assigned after care worker. Youth A reported she\nnever received any gifts from staff and has not had any contact\nwith anyone since leaving the program. Youth A stated she did not\nhave any past or current plans to take a trip with any staff and did\nnot know why someone would think that. Youth A reported she\nowned a phone, which she bought with her own money and paid\nthe bill without assistance.\nWhen asked about Staff 1, Youth A stated that she was nice, but\nthey were not close. Staff 1 never gave Youth A any gifts or sold\nany items to her. Staff 1 contacted Youth A once after leaving the\nprogram but never made plans to travel with Youth A. Youth A did\nnot provide any additional information about that contact. Youth A\nreported she did not have personal relationships with any staff at\nVista Maria and did not have any concerns about staff.\nOn 7/16/24 a follow-up phone call occurred with Youth A.

Staff 1 denied ever giving Youth A a cell phone, or any\n3",
    "other gifts. Staff 1 denied any plans to travel with Youth A. Staff 1\nstated she has never had a discussion with any youth about\ntraveling anywhere together. Staff 1 reported she did not know\nYouth A well, as she did not work in her building often. Staff 1\nwould see Youth A at the school on occasion, but they did not talk\nor have a personal relationship. Staff 1 stated she would never\ncross that boundary with a youth. Staff 1 could not think of any\nreason someone would make this allegation, as she never had a\nconversation with Youth A about travel. Staff 1 reported she did\nnot request to be on Youth A’s call list. Staff 1 was aware that\nYouth A told her therapist there were a few staff that she felt may\nbe supportive of her transition to independent living. However,\nStaff 1 never heard anything further and was informed by Youth\nA’s DHHS worker that a “call list” was not needed, as Youth A had\nher own phone and was able to reach out to anyone she chose.\nStaff 1 again denied having any contact with Youth A since she\nleft the program and denied giving Youth A a phone or making any\nplans to take her anywhere.\nQuality Improvement (QI) Manager was interviewed face-to-face\nat Vista Maria on 5/30/24. QI Manager reported she was aware of\nthe allegation and received an email from the therapist that Youth\nA requested to have Staff 1 and another staff added to her “call\nlist” as approved people. As there is not a “call list”, no action was\ntaken, but QI Manager was informed of the request due to policy\nabout staff contact with youth. QI Manager did not have any\nknowledge of a cell phone being provided to Youth A or plans for\na trip with Staff 1.\nIndependent Living (IL) Staff 2 emailed DCWL on 7/3/2024 to\nreport encountering Youth A while on the phone with someone\nbelieved to be Staff 1. Youth A admitted the person she was\ntalking to was staff from Vista Maria but would not provide any\nother information. Youth A did not provide any information about\nher cell phone or plans to travel with any staff. IL Staff 2 discussed\nwith Youth A that a social relationship with any current or former\nstaff is not appropriate. Youth A was not receptive to this\ninformation.\nStaff 2 emailed DCWL on 7/11/24 to report that she took Youth A\nto pay her phone bill at a Metro PCS store on 6/28/24. While at\nthe store, Youth A gave her name as the account holder. The\nstore employee pulled up the account, stated that $96 was due,\nand accepted the payment. Youth A did not receive a receipt.\nTherefore, documentation was unavailable to show whose\naccount the name was in. However, Staff 2 noted that when\n4",
    "Youth A went up to the counter, she gave her name to the\nemployee and they were able to look up her account.\nStaff 3 was interviewed by phone on 7/16/24. Staff 3 reported that\nshe was not aware of any staff making plans to travel with Youth\nA. Staff 3 stated she has not had any contact with Youth A since\nshe was discharged from the facility. However, Staff 3 recalled\nthat Youth A had called the unit and spoke with staff over the past\nfew weeks. Staff 3 was uncertain which staff spoke with Youth A.\nWhen asked how Youth A had Staff 3’s phone number, Staff 3\nstated the therapist asked for her phone number as someone that\ncould be a support to Youth A after leaving the program. Staff 3\nstated she was aware of the agency policy regarding contact with\nyouth but thought she could give her phone number to Youth A if it\nwas approved by the right people, such as the therapist that asked\nfor it.\nChief Administrator was emailed on 7/3/2024 and made aware\nof the information from IL Staff 2 that Staff 1 was potentially\nhaving phone contact with Youth A. Chief Administrator stated the\nissue would be addressed with Staff 1.\nFollow-up occurred via email on 7/12/2024 to notify the Chief\nAdministrator that Youth A’s file contained names and personal\nphone numbers of two Vista Maria staff (Staff 1 and Staff 3), listed\nas “mentor” by Youth A.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A’s file with the IL program contained a sheet in\nwhich Youth A provided two names and personal cell\nphone numbers of staff from Vista Maria. Youth A indicated\nthey were both mentors.\n• Human Resources files for Staff 1 and Staff 3. Orientation\nand training were completed as required. Both staff\nreceived training on agency policies during orientation,\nwhich included the Staff and Client Interaction Policy.\nNeither staff had any disciplinary action on file regarding\ncontact with youth or purchasing items for youth.\n• Staff and Client Interaction Policy for Vista Maria. The\npolicy stated the following:\n• “Personal staff information such as telephone number,\naddress, or social media contact information must not\nbe shared with clients”.\n• “Material goods or services must never be given or sold\nby staff to clients”\n5",
    "• “Staff must not socialize with current or former clients,\nexcept during Vista Maria sponsored activities”\nAnalysis Regarding the allegation that Staff 1 provided Youth A with a cell\nphone and they planned to travel together, no violation was found.\nStaff 1 and Youth A denied the allegation and there was no\nadditional evidence available.\nHowever, a violation was found as Youth A reported having phone\ncontact with Staff 1 after moving to the IL program. Youth A also\nhad the names and personal phone numbers of two staff, and\nindicated the staff provided this information to her, which is\nagainst agency policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV.
