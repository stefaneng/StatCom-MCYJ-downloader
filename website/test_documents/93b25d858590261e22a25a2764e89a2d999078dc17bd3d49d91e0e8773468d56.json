Foster\nCare Supervisor reported never learning of the allegations by Staff\n1 and denied reading through the parenting time notes in the\nservice plans.

Staff 1 supervised parenting time visits, however\nthere were no reports of abuse/neglect called into centralized\nintake. Five of the reported parenting time contacts report\nsuspected abuse. There were multiple junctures in which the\nagency failed to contact Centralized Intake and file a DHS-3200.\nTechnical Assistance\nCurrently the agency incident reporting policy states to report\nincidents to supervisors however, if staff suspect abuse/neglect\nthese incidents should be reported immediately to centralized\nintake and not immediately to a supervisor first.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206.
