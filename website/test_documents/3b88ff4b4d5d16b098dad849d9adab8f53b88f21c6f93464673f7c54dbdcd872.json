    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe single violation was of Rule 400.4114 and involved one employee file without\ndocumentatino of the required annual TB testing. The action step taken is to have\nthe Administrative Assistant notify the employee to complete the task of the TB\ntesting 60-days prior to their due date for the testing. The supervisor will also be\nmade aware of the upcoming due date for the testing. This issue was not found to\nbe of concern during this inspection.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) addressed the CAP required from the 2022 Renewal\ninspection and she outlined the action steps that have helped the facility stay in\ncompliance over the reporting period. She also addressed the CAP dated 2/2022 in\nregard to the Special Investigation 2022C0328003 in which the facility failed to\ninform the licensing authority of a youth who had gone AWOL. The facility’s action\nsteps are outlined, and it appears they have been complying since the incident. The\nagency struggles to hire staff and the efforts have been made to overcome these\nbarriers. The facility has been able to reach the goal of being fully staffed by\n6/2023. The CA identified since completing the required CAPs they have been able\nto obtain full compliance. The executive Director, Social Services Supervisor,\nShelter Supervisor, and Therapist Supervisor meet weekly to address concerns\nrelated to youth files, policy, and/or general concerns. Leadership meets at least\nmonthly to review policy and process any overarching issues that may arise. The\ncurrent CA is new and began this position just prior to this inspection. She met all of\nthe requirements and has a wealth of knowledge and experience in providing\nservices to youth.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff report feeling supported by administration and feel very comfortable with the\nnew CA. The believe she will provide an excellent source of information and\nsupport to the staff and youth at the facility. They identified the training provided as\nhelpful and look forward to future training to enhance their ability to be supportive of\n3",

They also reported staff are very\nsupportive and the facility is helping them develop the skills necessary to move on\nwith their life.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThis is single level older structure which has been maintained. The facility is\nfurnished appropriate, and all plumbing is in working order. The facility has ample\nfood supplies with both fresh fruit and vegetables. The menu is posted as is the\nemergency number. The overnight room check logs and emergency logs were\nreviewed and both meet compliance. Fire extinguishers are up to date.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n10/6/23\n_____________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 6, 2023\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
