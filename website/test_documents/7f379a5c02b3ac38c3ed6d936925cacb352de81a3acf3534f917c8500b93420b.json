INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12409\nSection (1) An agency’s education policy shall ensure that, within 5 school\nDescription days of placement, an agency shall provide for the enrollment of\neach child of school age, as defined by state law, into a school\nprogram.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was not registered for school within five days.\nInvestigation The Reporting Source was not interviewed for this investigation\nbecause the telephone number or contact information was not\nprovided for interview.\nNote: This investigation was initiated due to a companion case\ninvolving two foster parents’ licenses with two different private\nagencies and siblings placed in the homes where each agency\nhas full responsibility for each sibling. For more detailed\ninformation refer to SI#2023C0000054.\nThe Program Director was interviewed on 11/23/2022. The\nProgram Director reported that her agency has full case\nresponsibility for Youth A who is the sibling of Youth B. Another\nagency has full case responsibility for Youth B. Youth B left his\nfoster home over the weekend of 10/08/2022, due to an\naltercation with his foster parent and moved to his sister’s foster\nhome. The Program Director reported this arrangement was\n2",
    "made by their agency foster parent and Youth B’s foster parent\nfrom the other agency and without the knowledge of either agency\ncaseworker. She said neither foster parent followed the agencies’\npolicies of reporting this information to the assigned caseworkers\nthe weekend of 10/08/2022.\nThe Program Director reported she learned of this information on\nMonday, 10/11/2022 from her licensing supervisor who was\ninformed by their foster parent that Youth A’s sibling was in her\nhome and refusing to return to his foster parent. She said her\nagency contacted the Program Manager of Samaritas -Southeast\nto discuss placement options and what had occurred over the\nweekend between the foster parents and the siblings.\nThe Program Director reported there were several Team Decision\nMeetings (TDM) held with Samaritas - Southeast and DHHS case\nworker and supervisor. She reported initially her agency was not\nin favor of Youth B living in the home of their foster parent and\nwith his sister, Youth A. She said however, their Foster Parent\nreported in the TDM meeting held on 10/24/2022, that she would\nbe willing to keep Youth B in her home as a borrowed bed\nplacement. She said all parties agreed to this placement option\ndue to Youth B having no other placement option. She said\npaperwork for a borrowed bed placement began. The Program\nDirector said Youth B was refusing to return to his foster parent\nand that his foster parent from Samaritas - Southeast was refusing\nto allow Youth B back into her home. She said she learned that\nYouth B had an altercation with his foster parent, became enraged\nin the home and destroyed items in his bedroom. Youth B’s foster\nparent requested a 30 – day removal.\nThe Program Director said Samaritas - Southeast has full\nresponsibility of Youth B therefore, their agency did not make\narrangement for enrolling Youth B in school. She reported the\nborrowed bed request was not signed until 11/03/2022. Youth B\nhad not attended school since the weekend of 10/08/2022.\nThe Program Director reported that on 11/08/2022 the foster care\nworker for Youth A asked the foster care worker from Youth B’s\nagency about his school enrollment and whether this was a\npermanent placement for Youth B. The Program Director reported\nthat the caseworker from Samaritas - Southeast stated that efforts\nwere still being made for Youth B’s placement. She said since\nSamaritas – Southeast still had full case responsibility, it was\nsuggested that Samaritas - Southeast enroll Youth B in school.\n3",
    "The Licensing Supervisor and Foster Care Worker reported the\nsame information as the Program Director. There was no\nadditional information to add.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nA timeline documentation of information detailing the interaction\nbetween both private agencies regarding Youth A and Youth B’s\nplacement.\nSafety plans for the youth’s while being placed together provided\nto the foster parent.\nTDM minutes between the agencies and DHHS discussing\nplacement options, safety plans, and case responsibility.\nAnalysis The enrollment in school for Youth B is the responsibility of the\nagency who has full case responsibility of Youth B. Therefore,\nYouth B’s placement in a Child Safe foster home did not make\nthem responsible for school enrollment. That responsibility\nremained with the placing agency.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n03/12/2023\n______________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n03/12/2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
