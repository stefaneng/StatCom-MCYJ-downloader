INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited\nto:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was physically abused by staff during an escalated\nincident on 11/03/2024.\nInvestigation The Complainant was contacted on 12/06/2024 and no additional\ninformation was provided.\nYouth A was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n11/04/2024. Youth A stated the incident started when he was\ntrying to fight Youth B, and he also tried to break a window. Youth\nA stated he ended up outside and he tried to break a window,\nresulting in him being restrained. Youth A described the location\nas outside of his cottage by a tree with a large rock. He believed\nthere were five staff involved and initially did not want to state any\nnames. During the restraint Youth A was pinned to the ground,\nand as this was occurring, he grabbed a female staff member’s\narm. Youth A stated the female staff member then hit him in the\narm. He stated this may have been Staff 5. Youth A also\nbelieved Staff 2 had a hold of his wrist and twisted it during the\nrestraint. Youth A could not remember exactly what occurred\nnext. He stated someone put a blanket over him at one point,\ncausing him to get more upset. Youth A stated that eventually law\nenforcement arrived and that was when the restraint ended.\nYouth A’s Foster Care Worker provided information on\n11/06/2024. She stated she had been in communication with the\nfacility as well as the school where Youth A had been attending\nand was aware of the incident. She stated she had seen Youth A\non 10/28/2024 and he was a part of an incident on 10/29/2024\n2",
    "that resulted in a visit to the hospital. She did not express any\nother concerns about the facility.\nThe Chief Administrator and Program Director were\ninterviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 11/07/2024 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit. They provided information related\nto a separate incident that resulted in Youth A obtaining a\nconcussion but were not directly apart of this incident pertaining to\nthe allegations.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 11/07/2024\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit. He recalled the\nincident beginning with Youth A and Youth B “horseplaying.” His\ndefinition of that was that the two youth would often play around\nwith each other, but it would often turn into a verbal or physical\naltercation. While they were still inside the cottage, Staff 1 tried to\nget both of the youth to stop and had to verbally de-escalate\nYouth A from attempting to fight Youth B. Staff 1 was able to then\nswitch over to be with Youth B and take him outside to remove\nhim from the situation. As Staff 1 was walking around the cottage\nwith Youth B he saw Youth A was then outside with Staff 3 and\nStaff 4. At that time Youth A was trying to break windows. Staff 4\nheard Staff 3 and Staff 4 trying to de-escalate Youth A. Youth A\neventually was on the ground on his back and two staff were\nholding his arms. Staff 1 could not describe who was where in\nrelation to Youth A. Staff 1 recalled Youth A’s head being off of\nthe ground as he was continually yelling and resisting the\nrestraint. He also recalled another staff member bringing out a\nblanket to put underneath Youth A’s head as a precautionary\nmeasure. He stated that the blanket was never placed over Youth\nA. Staff 1 attempted to assist with holding Youth A’s legs but was\nunsuccessful in doing so as Youth A kicked back at him. Staff 1\nrecalled Youth A only calming at the presence of law\nenforcement. Staff 1 denied himself or any other staff hitting\nYouth A in any way. He also re-iterated that Youth A was never\nface down during the restraint.\nYouth B was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 11/07/2024\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit. He recalled the\nincident starting with he and Youth A fighting. He recalled being\nseparated from Youth A and going outside with Staff 1. When\nYouth B was outside, he saw Youth A push Staff 2. Youth A then\nstarted to throw items at any staff that were near him. Youth B\nsaw Staff 2 initiate a restraint by attempting to hold Youth A’s\narms from behind him. Youth B did not see any more of the\nrestraint attempt as he went back inside of the cottage.\n3",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n11/18/2024. He stated that he was not a part of the restraint\noutside but interacted with Youth A inside as he escalated. At one\npoint Youth A had a pot in his hand in the kitchen and attempted\nto throw it at Staff 2, and Staff 2 was able to deflect this by\ngrabbing Youth A’s wrist and Youth A let go of the pot. Staff 2\nstated that Youth A then went outside and Staff 2 stayed\ninside. He recalled witnessing much of the restraint at that point\nfrom inside. Staff 2 saw Youth A be restrained by other staff and\nhad no concerns on how this was performed.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n11/18/2024. Staff 3 recalled interacting with Youth A once he was\noutside. Youth A was throwing rocks at windows and escalating\nsignificantly to the point of needing to be restrained. Staff 3 stated\nthat this quickly turned into a restraint on the ground because\nYouth A dropped his weight and fell to the ground. Staff 3 stated\nYouth A was on his back the entire time he was on the\nground. He also recalled a blanket being provided to Youth A to\nprotect his head from the ground, and denied that the blanket was\never placed over Youth A. Staff 3 denied hitting Youth A in any\nway, and denied seeing any other staff do the same.\nStaff 4 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n11/18/2024. Staff 4 recalled the day in question, specifically that\nYouth A and Youth B had been arguing and needed to be\nseparated. Staff 4 recalled Staff 2 being with Youth B when Youth\nA escalated further and went outside the cottage. Staff 4 recalled\nhaving to initiate a restraint of Youth A with Staff 3 because he\nwas not able to listen to them and continuing to escalate, including\nthrowing rocks at the building and at staff. Staff 4 recalled Youth\nA slapping her in the face and knocking her glasses off. He also\nhit Staff 5 and attempted to bite Staff 3. As Staff 4 and Staff 3\nwere attempting to restrain Youth A he slid down to the\nground. Youth A then got back up and attempted to fight again,\nonly for the same attempted restaurant and self-inflicted fall to the\nground to happen again. Staff 4 stated Youth A was restrained on\nthe ground for a couple more minutes until law enforcement\nshowed up. She commented that another staff member brought\nout a blanket to be used as a pillow while Youth A was on the\nground. Staff 4 recalled Youth A having the recent concussion\nand there was concern that he could hit his head on the\nground. Staff 4 denied that the blanket ever choked Youth A or\nwas above his body in any way. She also stated that she never\nhit or pushed Youth A, nor did any other staff involved.\n4",
    "Staff 5 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n11/18/2024. Staff 5 recalled attempting to assist in the restraint of\nYouth A once they were outside. She confirmed that she was the\nstaff member who brought out a blanket to use as protection for\nYouth A’s head. Staff 5 stated the blanket was never strangling or\ncovering Youth A in any way. She did this because she was\naware of the recent concussion suffered by Youth A. Staff 5 also\nattempted to control Youth A’s legs while he was on his back on\nthe ground but was unsuccessful in doing so and Staff 1\nattempted to take over. Staff 5 recalled Youth A reaching a calm\ndemeanor when law enforcement arrived. Staff 5 denied seeing\nYouth A be hit or pushed by staff in any way.\nIt was reported during a video conference with DHHS Worker 1\non 12/04/2024 that her investigation had not yet been completed\nand no results could yet be shared. It was confirmed on\n01/30/2025 that DHHS Worker 1’s investigation did not produce\nany findings.\nVideo footage reviewed:\n• Facility security camera footage for the incident that\noccurred on 11/03/2024 at approximately 3:00 pm was\nprovided and reviewed. Youth A was initially seen throwing\nrocks at the cottage from the outside and being followed by\nstaff around the exterior. A clear view of the incident in\nquestion was not able to be viewed as it occurred outside\nand a distance away from the exterior camera on the\ncottage. At 3:14 pm Youth A could be seen being\nrestrained on the ground by staff and appeared to be\nfighting back. At 3:20 pm Law Enforcement could be seen\narriving at the scene and interacting with Youth A as they\nplaced him under arrest.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Incident report documentation dated 11/03/2024 was\nprovided and reviewed. Separate incident reports authored\nby Staff 1, Staff 4, and Staff 5 all provided similar\ndescriptions of the incident and had no inconsistencies\nfrom the interviews provided.\n• Training documentation for Staff 2 was provided and\nreviewed, showing he was current on his restraint model\ntraining as of 07/09/2024.\n• Facility policy titled “Physical Intervention” and last dated\n09/01/2024 was provided and reviewed. This policy stated\n5",
    "that staff were never to intervene with the use of physical\nrestraint in order “to inflict pain or harm.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews, video footage and other documentation\nreviewed. There was no evidence found to show that Youth A’s\nhead was pushed to the ground or that he was choked or hit by\nstaff while being restrained.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility is advised to consider its health services policy\nto ensure that necessary medical information for youth is\nshared with all staff that would need it. Multiple staff\nmembers involved in the incident that occurred on\n11/03/2024 were aware that Youth A had recently suffered\na concussion, but multiple others were not aware. Had this\ninformation been shared more widely it could have had a\npositive effect on the situation.\nConsultation provided:\n• The facility is advised to edit policy and procedures\nregarding behavior management and physical management\nof youth to ensure that the prohibited acts within rule\n400.4158 (1) (a) (ii) are clearly outlined within the policy.\n• The facility is advised to review policy and procedures\nspecific to the use of physical managements to align with\nrule 400.4160. The use of emergency restraint no longer\nincludes the sole reason being the destruction of property.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n01/30/2025\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n01/31/2025\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n7"
