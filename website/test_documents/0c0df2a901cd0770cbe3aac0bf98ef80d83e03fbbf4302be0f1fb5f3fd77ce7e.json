The complainant\nstated the child (Child A) was placed in the home for approximately one week, where\nhe put holes in the wall, and assaulted the foster parents and their child.\n2",
    "Complainant\nOn 3/21/22 a follow up phone call occurred with the complainant for additional\ninformation. They reported there is currently an investigation regarding the foster\nhome, due to the foster parent’s use of restraint to stop the child from injuring\nhimself and others. The home is licensed with another agency but borrowed by\nSamaritas for this placement. The foster parent reported to the complainant that she\nwas unaware of how significant Child A’s behaviors were, before accepting the\nborrowed bed placement. The foster parent also reported being unaware of the\nSamaritas policy that restraint is prohibited, as their licensing agency told them\nrestraint is allowed per licensing rules in extreme situations and when the foster\nparent is properly trained. The foster parent and her husband are both trained in\nsafe therapeutic holds through their employment. The matter of restraint continues to\nbe investigated by DHHS and the licensing agency but will likely not have any\nfindings.\nThe complainant specified the behaviors exhibited by Child A included putting holes\nin the wall, pulling insulation out of the wall, breaking household items, assaulting a\n3-year-old child in the home, scratching, punching, and kicking the foster parents in\nthe face.\nChief Administrator\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) was informed of the allegations on 3/24/22. The CA\nreported Child A was receiving Enhanced Foster Care services to help with\nemotional regulation. Child A’s behaviors included yelling, throwing items, and\nslamming doors. While he previously had incidents of being physically aggressive,\nhis behaviors had improved recently. The CA was not involved in the placement of\nChild A in the borrowed foster home and could not speak to what information was\nprovided at placement.\nFoster Care Worker\nOn 4/7/22 the Foster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed by DCWL via video\nconference. The FCW reported a virtual meeting was held on the morning on 3/7/22\nwith the licensing supervisor, both foster parents, and staff from the other agency.\nThe FCW explained Child A’s behaviors in the meeting. The FCW reported being\nopen and honest with the information shared as she wanted the foster parents to be\nfully aware. This information included telling the foster parents about a behavioral\nissue that morning at Child A’s temporary placement. The police were called to\nassist in calming Child A. The FCW stated she shared all of Child A’s history. The\nfoster parents asked a lot of questions, then requested to discuss it privately before\nmaking a decision. The meeting ended and a short time later the foster parent’s\nlicensing agency notified the FCW they would accept the placement. The FCW\nreported she did not document the details of the meeting or what information was\nprovided to the foster parents. Regarding the use of therapeutic holds, the FCW was\naware of the investigation and confirmed the agency has a policy not to use any\nholds. The FCW stated they did not discuss this policy in the meeting with the foster\nparents as the worker thought all agencies had this policy. However, the FCW\n3",
    "believed this requirement may be located on the borrowed bed paperwork signed by\nthe foster parents.\nIntake worker\nOn 4/7/22 the Intake Worker was interviewed by DCWL via video conference. The\nworker reported being involved in identifying the borrowed foster home for Child A.\nSeveral calls and emails went between the agencies, relaying information. A virtual\nmeeting was then scheduled for 3/7/22 to discuss the potential placement with the\nfoster home and their agency. During the meeting the FCW provided detailed\ninformation about Child A’s needs, behaviors, and reason for move. The Intake\nWorker specifically recalled discussing Child A’s struggles with school, behaviors at\nthe prior placement, and police intervention that morning. In addition, the foster\nparents were informed about intensive services available to support the foster\nparents. Much of this information was provided to the family by the Foster Care\nSupervisor. The foster parents asked a lot of questions and ultimately agreed to\naccept the placement. The foster parents asked how Child A was with younger\nchildren, as they were concerned about their own two children in the home. The\nagency reported no known issues of violence with younger kids. The worker did not\nrecall any discussion about the use of therapeutic holds at the foster home. The\nIntake Worker reported being unsure if the information presented in the meeting had\nbeen documented. However, the worker indicated the FCW should have completed\na placement outline for the foster parents to sign when placement occurred.\nFoster Care Supervisor\nOn 4/8/22 the Foster Care Supervisor (Supervisor) was interviewed by DCWL via\nvideo conference. Supervisor reported being part of the 3/7/22 meeting with the\nFCW, Intake Worker, Licensing Worker, Foster Parents, and staff from the other\nagency. The meeting’s purpose was to provide information to the foster parents prior\nto accepting placement. Supervisor reported the foster parents were informed of\nChild A’s contact with police that morning. The foster parents asked for specifics\nabout his behavior and were told he had been aggressive and throwing items at\npeople, but not attacking people directly. After the police intervened Child A was\ncalm. Supervisor reported his pattern of behavior was to have outbursts when off his\nmedication, or when feeling stress or anxiety. Therefore, this incident was likely due\nto Child A being stressed about the upcoming move. Supervisor reported they\ndiscussed Child A’s prior placements and behaviors with the foster parents. Child A\nhad been aggressive in other placements but never targeting any people, just\nobjects. Supervisor was informed that upon review of the case file it was found that a\nplacement outline was not completed to document what information was provided to\nthe foster parents. Supervisor reported she would follow up with the staff responsible\nfor uploading that document. A copy of the borrowed bed packet and behavior\nmanagement policy were also requested from Supervisor.\nLicensing Worker\nOn 4/12/22 the Licensing Worker was interviewed by DCWL via video conference.\nThe worker reported she was not part of the meeting with the foster parents on\n4",
    "3/7/22. Nor did she participate in placement. However, she was part of the email\nchain in which information was shared with the foster parents and their licensing\nagency. The worker verified the information provided as reported by the FCW,\nSupervisor, and Intake Worker. Additionally, the Licensing Worker agreed to provide\nthe requested Borrowed Bed documents.\nFoster Parent\nOn 5/5/22 Foster Parent was interviewed by DCWL via phone. Foster Parent\nrecalled when Child A was placed in their home, he was very different than she\nexpected. Foster Parent stated she understood Samaritas shared the information\nthey had available, and that children’s behaviors could change or be triggered in\ndifferent situations. Foster Parent confirmed the video conference on 3/7/22 was\nwith Samaritas staff and her agency staff to discuss the potential placement.\nSamaritas informed Foster Parent that Child A had behavioral outbursts, difficulty\nexpressing emotions, physical aggression, and anxiety. Foster Parent was informed\nhe was on medication and diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and\nEmotional Impairment. It was also explained that most of his behaviors occurred\nwhen he was not taking his medication at a previous placement. However, the\ntemporary placement he was coming from stated he was consistently taking his\nmedication and had demonstrated no behavioral concerns. Foster Parent confirmed\nshe was informed during the 3/7/22 call that Child A was in “enhanced foster care”,\nbut she did not fully understand how significant his needs were. Foster Parent\nreported she was not given a placement outline to review or sign after agreeing to\naccept Child A into their home. She further reported that the worker who brought\nChild A to her home did very little paperwork with her. Foster Parent did not receive\na copy of the Samaritas policies/handbook.\nLicensing agency staff\nThe licensing agency for Foster Parent was contacted on 5/5/22 via email. The\nagency’s Licensing Supervisor confirmed attendance at the 3/7/22 meeting.\nLicensing Supervisor further confirmed the foster parents were informed about Child\nA’s behavioral concerns, needs, and services at that meeting.\nDocument review\nChild A’s case record was reviewed for relevant information:\n Child A was placed with a relative 10/14/20-1/15/21, removal reason was\nmarked “other”.\n Child A was placed in a licensed foster home from 2/1/22-3/7/22.

The safety plan\ndid not detail specific behaviors.\n Child A was placed in the foster home from 3/7/22-3/15/22. A placement\noutline (DHHS-3307) was not located in the file, nor was there other\ndocumentation to detail what information was provided to the foster parents\nprior to placement.\n5",
    " Case contacts indicated initial placement paperwork was completed by the\nfoster care worker, with the foster parent, at the home on 3/7/22.\n Medication review indicated Child A was prescribed Vyvanse to assist with\nemotional dysregulation.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12417 Foster parent information\n(1)An agency shall provide a foster parent with all of the\nfollowing information before the placement or replacement\nof a child: (e) All known emotional and psychological\nfactors relating to the care of the child, (f) All known\nbehaviors of the child, (h) Any other known information to\nenable the foster parent to provide a stable, safe and\nhealthy environment for the foster child and foster family…\nANALYSIS: Interviews with agency staff and the foster parent confirmed\ninformation about the child was provided during a virtual\nmeeting that occurred prior to placement.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12405 Change of placement\n(3)The agency shall document all of the following in the\nchild’s record before a change of placement occurs: (g)\nInformation about the child was shared with the new\nplacement consistent with the requirements of R400.12417\nANALYSIS: Interviews determined that information required by R400.12417\nwas provided verbally to the foster parents.

    " An “Acknowledgment of Receipt Borrowed Bed” form was signed by the\nIntake Worker and the Foster Parent on 3/7/22. The form indicated the foster\nparent received orientation, discipline policy and behavior management, and\nthe foster parent handbook.\nOn 5/5/22 the Foster Parent reported the meeting at her home on 3/7/22 for\nborrowed bed paperwork was very brief. The Foster Parent reported signing the\nBorrowed Bed agreement and “acknowledgment” form. However, the Foster Parent\nstated the check boxes on the form were not marked when she signed. The check\nboxes were to indicate the foster parents were given an orientation to the agencies\npolicies and procedures and a copy of the foster parent handbook. The Foster\nParent stated the boxes were not checked, as the documents had not been\nprovided, and the worker stated they would take care of that at a later date. DCWL\nprovided a copy of the form to the Foster Parent for verification. The Foster Parent\nconfirmed their signature, but again stated the boxes were not checked when she\nsigned the form. The Foster Parent noted the form was signed in black ink by the\nIntake Worker, with the boxes also checked off in black ink. The foster parent’s\nsignature was in blue ink. The Foster Parent stated she would have checked off the\nboxes in blue ink if she had received the items. The Foster Parent reiterated this\nwas not her first borrowed bed experience and she knew what documents she\nshould have received.\nOn 5/6/22 follow-up occurred with the Intake Worker for clarification about which\nitems were provided to the foster parents when borrowed bed paperwork was\ncompleted. The Intake Worker reported she sent the documents to the foster home\nwith the staff that transported Child A to the home. The Intake Worker then signed\nthe forms and marked the check boxes when the forms returned to the office. The\nIntake Worker stated the process was rushed due to the placement happening a day\nearlier than planned. Therefore, the Intake Worker could not verify if an orientation or\ncopies of the policies were provided to the foster parents.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12326 Borrowed home.\n(1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by\nanother agency or tribe, the agency shall have a record\ncontaining all of the following documents:\n(f) Documentation that the foster parent has received\norientation to the policies of the borrowing agency.\n(g) A copy of the foster parent /agency agreement signed\nby the foster parent and the borrowing agency.\n7",

    "summary": "The investigation examined an allegation that Samaritas - West failed to inform foster parents of a child's aggressive behaviors before placement. While interviews determined the information was verbally shared in a pre-placement meeting, the agency violated licensing rules by failing to properly document that information sharing and other required placement paperwork. Specifically, violations were established for not documenting the change of placement and for failing to verify that required borrowed bed orientation documents were provided to the foster parents. The agency is clearly culpable for multiple administrative and documentation failures that compromised procedural safeguards.",
