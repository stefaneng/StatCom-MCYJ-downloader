    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nDescription and able to meet the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster care case manager made inappropriate comments about\nfoster parents to foster youth during case contacts.\nInvestigation On 3/10/25 DCWL received an email dated 3/7/25 that Foster\nParent 1 and Foster Parent 2 sent to Licensing Supervisor and\nFoster Care Supervisor. The email reported concerns regarding\nthe previous and current foster care case workers, Foster Care\nWorker 1 and Foster Care Worker 2. The concerns were as\nfollows:\n• Children reported that workers have been visiting them at\nschool and making inappropriate remarks to intentionally\nundermine foster parents.\n• Workers told the children, “What happens in Vegas, stays\nin Vegas” encouraging children to withhold information from\nfoster parents and parents.\n• While transporting children, the worker was on the phone\nspeaking negatively about foster parents.\n• Worker made inappropriate remarks to children, claiming\nfoster parents are “only in this for the money” and\ndiscussing how much money caregivers received.\n• Agency leadership was informed of these incidents, but\nthere has not been any resolution.\nInterviews\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 were jointly interviewed by\nphone on 3/13/25. Regarding the items outlined in the allegations,\nFoster Parent 1 reported Licensing Supervisor, Foster Care\nSupervisor, and Section Manager were made aware of their\nconcerns. Foster Parent 1 stated they felt like their concerns were\nnot addressed, as Foster Care Worker 2 (FCW2) continues to\n“nitpick” their actions and say things that should not be said in\nfront of the foster children about the money that is paid for their\ncare. Foster Parent 1 stated that Foster Care Worker 1 (FCW1)\nalso spoke with the children about money that was paid for their\n2",
    "care. One of the children reported that FCW1 said, “they wouldn’t\nhave that f***ing house without foster care payments”. This was\nreportedly said in front of a Youth C. Foster Parent 1 stated they\npride themselves on doing a lot of fun activities with kids in their\ncare. More than what foster care payments would cover. Foster\nParent 1 added that FCW1 told the kids previously that the foster\nparents did not care about them, and the kids were just a\npaycheck.\nFoster Parent 1 reported FCW2 visited Youth A at school and\ninformed the youth they were moving to Independent Living and\ndid not have a choice in the matter. FCW2 reportedly told Youth A\nit was out of their control and came from the “higher ups”. Youth\nA then told his parent that Foster Parent 1 put in a notice to have\nhim moved. Youth A and his parent were very upset by this.\nFoster Parent 1 stated FCW2 also went to the school recently and\nbad mouthed them to Youth A, then said, “what happens in\nVegas, stays in Vegas.” Foster Parent 2 expressed frustration\nabout FCW2 visiting the children at school. Foster Parent 1 stated\nthey understand that FCW2 can visit the children at school without\ninforming the caregiver, but the negative comments to the youth\nwere an issue.\nFoster Parent 1 reported they did put in a notice for removal of\nYouth C, as they were planning to go to Independent Living\nanyway, and they were always suspended from school. FCW2\nsaid Youth C would be leaving, but it did not happen quickly.\nFoster Parent 1 reported they typically took youth as a ‘last resort’.\nThe kids they accepted had high Determination of Care (DOC)\nrates. Foster Parent 1 expressed frustration that after the youth\nwere in their home for a while and behaviors improved, the DOC\nrate was decreased. Foster Parent 1 described it as feeling like a\npay cut for doing good work with the kids. DCWL Consultant\nexplained to Foster Parent 1 that DOC rates were based on the\nlevel of extra care or activities the foster parent was required to\ndo, to address a youth’s needs. If behaviors improved and\nrequired less intervention or transportation to appointments\ndecreased, then the rate may decrease. Foster Parent 1 indicated\nthey understood.\nFoster Parent 1 reported Youth C indicated they were in the car\nand heard FCW2 speaking negatively on the phone with Foster\nCare Supervisor about the foster parents. Youth C also reported\nFCW2 showed them emails that indicated the amount paid to\ncaregivers. Foster Parent 1 felt it was inappropriate for the worker\nto share that information with the youth.\n3",
    "Foster Parent 1 stated they planned to take Youth A, Youth B and\nYouth C on a trip out of the country. FCW2 said the kids could go.\nFoster Parent 1 purchased tickets, air fare, and told the kids. The\nkids were very excited. Then the next day, FCW2 told them they\ncould not go, because the Chief Administrator said the trip was not\nappropriate. FCW2 told Foster Parent 1 they should not be\nspending that much money on the kids, as it was not appropriate.\nFoster Parent 1 stated they did not contact the Chief Administrator\nor file a grievance regarding their concerns. Foster Parent 1\nexpressed fear of retaliation by the agency. Foster Parent 1 was\ntold by Youth C that FCW2 said, “they are making too much\nmoney in that house. They won’t make that much when I’m done\nwith them.” Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 verified they had\nnot heard any of the statements about money from FCW1 or\nFCW2, nor did they have any of these statements in text or email.\nThis information was provided to them verbally by foster youth that\nreported hearing the statements from FCW1 and FCW2.\nFollow-up email contact occurred with Foster Parent 1 on 4/3/25,\nin which they reported feeling targeted. Foster Parent 1 stated\nthey felt the agency was going to retaliate against them and cause\na special evaluation to be opened. Foster Parent 1 stated the\nagency had previously taken information and turned it on them, to\nstart a special evaluation. Foster Parent 1 did not provide further\ndetail. Foster Parent 1 indicated they believed their special\nevaluations were only valid for a year or two and should no longer\nbe used against them. DCWL Consultant responded that if Foster\nParent 1 felt targeted, they should contact the Chief Administrator\nand file a grievance. Foster Parent 1 was also informed that\nspecial evaluations never expire and can be used for assessment\nof a foster home for the duration of their licensure. In addition, the\nagency is required to open a special evaluation any time they\nreceive information of a potential rule violation. Regardless of if\nthey believe it to be true or not. The agency does not have the\noption to receive information, then determine a special evaluation\nwas not needed.\nChief Administrator was contacted by email on 3/11/25. Chief\nAdministrator was informed of the allegation. Chief Administrator\nprovided names and contact information for staff involved. Email\ncontact occurred again on 4/3/25 to notify Chief Administrator of\nthe family’s concerns and interest in information regarding a\ngrievance. On 5/5/25 follow-up occurred via email. Chief\nAdministrator reported he would reach out to Foster Parent 1 and\nFoster Parent 2 to discuss concerns and how to file a grievance if\nthey chose to do so.\n4",
    "Foster Care Worker 1 (FCW1) was interviewed via video call on\n3/20/25. FCW1 reported she was transferred from Youth C’s case\ndue to Foster Parent 1 feeling that she purposely denied DOC\nlevels. FCW1 stated that she never spoke negatively about foster\nparents in front of the children in the home, nor did she ever have\ninappropriate conversations with the children. The only time\nFoster Parent 1 was mentioned to Youth C was during a\ndiscussion about clothing allowances. Youth C asked for the\nmoney for clothing, and FCW1 redirected Youth C to Foster\nParent 1, as they had received the money. FCW1 denied ever\ntelling youth that the foster parents did not care about them or only\nfostered for the money.\nFCW1 stated the foster parents did not transport kids to visits or\ntherapy, which affected their DOC rate. Foster Parent 1 reportedly\nwas upset by this, as they believed transportation was the\nworker’s responsibility. During the case, Foster Parent 1 put in a\n30-day replacement request, with the denied DOC rate attached.\nFCW1 explained the original DOC rate at placement was higher,\nas the placement was an emergency. After Youth C was in the\nhome and reassessed, it was determined they did not meet the\nrequirements for a higher rate. One of the factors was that the\nfoster parents were not willing to assist with transportation, which\naffected the DOC score. Foster Parent 1 stated they would ask for\nremoval if the rate was denied. A Team Decision Meeting (TDM)\noccurred to discuss what could be done to maintain the\nplacement. Foster Parent 1 stated they would only consider\nrescinding the notice if the rate was approved. A few days later,\nYouth C became upset with FCW1, yelling and screaming in the\ncar that it was the worker’s fault they had to move. FCW1\nexplained to Youth C that it was not anyone’s fault as the plan was\nalways for them to go to Independent Living. FCW1 denied ever\nspeaking about the DOC rate or money with Youth C or showing\nthem documentation about foster care rates. FCW1 stated she\nnever heard any staff speak negatively about the foster parents in\nfront of the children placed in the home. However, it was known\nthat the foster parents would only take placement of youth with\nhigh DOC levels, which some people may interpret in a certain\nway. FCW1 was under the impression that Foster Parent 1 did\nnot have any concerns about FCW2, as to their knowledge none\nhad been reported until now.\nFoster Care Worker 2 (FCW2) was interviewed via video call on\n3/17/25. FCW2 reported Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2\nnever directly told her of any of their concerns. FCW2 stated they\n5",
    "never spoke with any youth about the foster parents or their\nfinances. FCW2 never heard any other staff talk about the foster\nparents or their finances. Staff noticed the foster parents would\nonly accept placement of youth with high DOC rates. This was\nevident in a recent removal request for Youth C, in which there\nwas a meeting that Foster Parent 1 stated they would only\nmaintain placement of Youth C if the high DOC level was\napproved. FCW2 stated DOC levels were also a factor with Youth\nA, as he was initially placed at a $300 per day rate due to it being\nan emergency. At the 30-day reassessment, the rate renewal was\ndenied by central office. A request for $200 per day and $150 per\nday were also submitted and denied. FCW2 stated that she\nappropriately scored Youth A on the DOC at a level 2, which\nFoster Parent 1 was unhappy about. However, the DOC rate was\nnever discussed with, or in front of, the youth. FCW2 stated one\nreason the higher DOC level was not approved was because the\nfoster parents would not transport the youth to medical/dental\nappointments, counseling, and parenting time. The other reason\nfor the lower score was due to Youth A not having any behavioral\nissues as initially reported. Regarding Youth C’s DOC rate, it\nlowered for the same reason. The foster parents were not\ntransporting youth to medical/dental appointments, visits, and\ntherapy. It was also reported Youth C did not have therapy\nscheduled for the last few weeks. In addition, FCW2 reported that\nthe foster parents had not been available to the school and would\nnot respond to calls from the school when Youth C was in trouble\nor needed to be picked up. FCW2 noted the foster parents\nrecently began transporting Youth C from parenting time once per\nweek, which would be included in the next reevaluation.\nFCW2 again denied ever speaking negatively to any of the youth\nabout the foster parents or their finances. Recently Youth C\ninquired about their clothing allowance. FCW2 redirected Youth C\nto Foster Parent 1, as they had received the money for clothing.\nThis occurred with Foster Care Supervisor present.\nFCW2 stated the agency had a few meetings with the foster\nparents over the past month or two regarding the group home\nlicense denial and the trip out of the country. FCW2 stated the\nfoster parents told the youth about the trip before receiving\nMDHHS approval. The youth had already informed their parents\nabout it, before MDHHS was informed. FCW2 stated she was told\nabout the trip, but did not approve it, as she knew it needed\napproval at a level above her. Ultimately the administration\ndecided the trip could not be approved, which the youth and foster\nparents were upset about. FCW2 did not believe the youth would\nmake up allegations about staff as a result of being upset about\n6",
    "not going on the trip. However, she noted Youth B said he felt it\nwas FCW2’s fault they could not go. Youth C’s mother also called\nFCW2, yelling that it was her fault the youth could not go. FCW2\nand FC Supervisor spoke with the kids to explain why the decision\nwas made. FCW2 denied making any threats of retaliation toward\nFoster Parents or stating, “they won’t make that much when I’m\ndone with them”.\nLicensing Supervisor was interviewed via video call on 3/14/25.\nLicensing Supervisor reported there was recently a TDM as the\nfoster parents wanted to take Youth A, Youth B and Youth C on a\ntrip out of the country. The team discussed the need for parental\nconsent, passports, etc. Licensing Supervisor stated the foster\nparents were not specifically told the kids could go on the trip, as\nthey remembered FCW2 stating that Section Manager and Chief\nAdministrator would have the final say. After the upper\nmanagement decided the kids could not go on the trip, the foster\nparents were informed via email. Foster Parent 1 was upset and\ncontacted Licensing Supervisor to report concerns about FCW2.\nFoster Parent 1 had not brought any concerns about FCW2 to\ntheir attention prior to that. Licensing Supervisor reported she\nnever heard any concerns about FCW2 from anyone else. When\nasked about any history with the foster parents, Licensing\nSupervisor indicated their license had been transferred to their\noffice in 2022. They had approximately eight special evaluations\npreviously. The foster parents recently applied for a group home\nlicense, but it was denied due to the number of special\nevaluations. Licensing Supervisor stated she never heard any\nstaff indicate that the family fostered for the money, or any\nstatements about their financial status.\nSection Manager was interviewed via video call on 3/14/25.\nSection Manager reported the foster parent’s concerns were\ndiscussed with them previously regarding FCW1. A meeting\noccurred and ultimately the agency decided to change the\nassigned case worker as it seemed to be the only resolution the\nfoster parents were satisfied with. FCW2 was then assigned to the\nchildren in the home. Recently, Foster Parent 1 reported similar\nconcerns about FCW2. A plan was developed to have Foster Care\nSupervisor present for any home visits, and to be present by\nphone during any transportation of youth. This plan was\ndeveloped in order to have a third-party present to verify what was\nor was not occurring. Section Manager reported there were no\nprior performance concerns regarding FCW1 or FCW2.\nSection Manager stated they planned to schedule a meeting to\ndiscuss the concerns from the 3/7/25 email, with the foster\n7",
    "parents. However, the foster parents did not respond to Section\nManager’s offer of three dates/times for a meeting to occur.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed via video call on\n3/14/25. FCS was aware of the prior concerns reported about\nFCW1. FCS reported she did not hear FCW1 make any\ninappropriate remarks about the foster parents. After the foster\nparents reported they were uncomfortable with FCW1, the agency\nchanged the children’s worker to FCW2. FCS reported that she\nwas never informed of any concerns about FCW2, until the email\non 3/7/25 that initiated this investigation. FCS never heard FCW2\nsay anything inappropriate about Foster Parent 1 or Foster Parent\n2. FCS stated she had frequent communication with FCW2 when\nshe was out on visits. However, FCS always checked with FCW2\nto ensure no one was present when they were having a phone\nconversation. FCS denied participating in a call with FCW2, with\nYouth C in the car, where they discussed the foster parents or\nfinances. FCS stated FCW2 is a very good worker and has been\nwith the agency for a long time, without any prior performance\nissues. FCS said she could not imagine FCW2 speaking\ninappropriately about any caregivers or parents. When the\ncomplaint was reported, FCS and FCW2 discussed the allegations\nand developed a plan. FCS will now be present via speaker phone\nwhenever FCW2 is transporting a youth placed in Foster Parent 1\nand Foster Parent 2’s home. This will allow for another person to\nbe witness to any conversations that occur. FCS will also attend\nhome visits with FCW2.\nFCS reported they did not have any financial concerns about the\nfoster parents. However, it was noted that DOC rates were an\nongoing issue, as the family typically only took youth with a higher\nDOC rate. Youth A was initially placed with a $300 per day rate,\nbased on his history. However, at the time of the 30-day\nreassessment the foster parents reported no behavioral issues\nand no difficulty in school. Therefore, the DOC score was lower,\nand the rate was decreased. Foster Parents requested a higher\nrate, which was denied by central office. Subsequent requests\nwere made for $200 and $150 per day, but they were also denied,\nas the youth did not have significant needs that required\nintervention by the caregivers. Youth A was attending therapy, but\nthe foster parents were not transporting him. Therefore, that could\nnot be incorporated into the DOC. A few weeks before this\ncomplaint, the foster parents requested a higher rate for another\nyouth in the home. FCS called to discuss what concerns there\nwere, as FCS was under the impression the youth’s behavior had\nimproved. Foster Parent 1 stated the youth’s behavior had not\n8",
    "improved. FCS asked Foster Parent 1 to email details about the\nbehaviors and what they were doing to manage them. Foster\nParent 1 agreed but did not submit anything. FCS reported the\nfoster parents do a lot of fun activities and family events with the\nyouth in their home. The kids enjoy being there. However, none of\nthe activities are relevant to what is required for a higher DOC\nlevel. FCS reported they did not have any concerns about the\nhome. There were no concerns about the care or safety of the\nyouth. The foster parents had not been scheduling therapy\nconsistently or transporting youth. But the caseworkers have\nstepped in to make sure appointments occur.\nRegarding the trip out of the country, the foster parents told the\nyouth that they were all going. The youth then told their parents,\nwho contacted the agency and asked about it. FCS stated the\nfoster parents were never told “yes” about the trip. When it first\ncame up, there was discussion about written parental consent and\ncourt approval, and the need for passports. FCW2 worked on\ngetting consent and travel authorizations. The foster parents\ninformed FCS that they put a deposit down for two youth as the\nparents verbally consented. The foster parents asked if they\nshould put a deposit for the third youth. FCS said they could, but\nthe agency was still working on obtaining written approvals.\nThrough all of this, the youth were calling the agency and urgently\nasking for information about plane tickets and communicating with\ntheir parents and the foster parents. There was a lot of go-\nbetween, confusion, and misinformation happening. Section\nManager then had a conversation with Chief Administrator\nregarding travel and passports. Ultimately, Chief Administrator did\nnot approve the trip. FCS and FCW2 spoke with the youth about\nthe decision. Youth A did not seem upset. Youth B seemed\nindifferent. Youth C was upset and did not want to talk about it.\nThe foster parents were unhappy in the meeting that occurred\nregarding the trip. The foster parents reported in the meeting\nFCW2 made Youth A uncomfortable, but did not provide any\ndetails. Youth A’s mother also called to report this. Based on the\ncall with Youth A’s mother, it seemed he was upset about a\nconversation FCW2 had with him about independent living. FCW2\nreportedly discussed a specific independent living program and\nwent over the questionnaire with Youth A. Youth A then called his\nmother in a panic, stating that he signed paperwork to go to\nindependent living and felt he was tricked into doing it. FCS\nexplained to Youth A’s mother that he did not sign anything, it was\nonly a questionnaire to gather more information about his IL skills.\n9",
    "Youth A’s mother was previously in agreement about IL, but\nchanged her mind after the trip out of the country was not\napproved. Youth A later went on a visit to the IL program and\ndetermined he did not want to go there. IL was not pursued any\nfurther. FCS reiterated that she has observed Youth A with FCW2\non several occasions, and Youth A never seemed uncomfortable\nwith her.\nLicensing Worker was interviewed via video call on 3/17/25.\nLicensing Worker reported they had not witnessed any comments\nmade to youth about either foster parent being financially\nmotivated. However, Licensing Worker acknowledged that staff\nwere aware the family would not accept a placement if the DOC\nrate was less than $250 per day. In addition, if the rate were to\ndrop, based on previous experience, the foster parents would\nlikely ask for replacement. This happened a couple of times.\nHowever, these discussions with the foster parents never\noccurred in front of youth. Licensing Worker stated that she was\nsomewhat familiar with the youth in the home. The youth had\nbehavioral issues. However, they were not enough to qualify for a\nlevel 3 DOC.\nLicensing Worker reported there were several special evaluations\nregarding the foster parents. Some were with the previous agency\nand some after transferring to this agency. None of the special\nevaluations involved finances or DOC rates; most were regarding\nbehavior management.\nLicensing Worker reported Foster Parent 1 did tell her they were\nconcerned about comments made by FCW1 and FCW2. Licensing\nWorker stated the team met internally to discuss the concerns. A\nmeeting was then held virtually with Foster Parent 1, in which they\ndiscussed the concerns and the trip out of the country not being\napproved. Foster Parent 1 indicated they felt misled and attacked.\nLicensing Worker reported she heard the youth make statements\nto the foster parents about the foster care workers, and\nstatements to foster care workers about the foster parents. Which\nseemed to indicate there was some manipulation or triangulation\ngoing on. Possibly because the youth were upset about the trip or\nsomething else. Licensing Worker stated she got the impression\nsome of the youth were trying to get what they wanted by pitting\nthe adults against one another. However, she did not have\nconcrete information to support that theory; it was just their feeling\nthat tensions had increased since the trip was canceled.\n10",
    "Youth A was interviewed face-to-face on 4/9/25. Youth A reported\nhe was in the foster home for about six months. Youth A stated he\nenjoyed the home, and they did a lot of fun activities together.\nYouth A stated he disliked the restrictions regarding internet\nusage. Youth A reported he thought FCW2 was a good worker\nand easy to talk to. However, both foster parents had said they felt\nFCW2 lied to them. This was specifically in reference to the trip\nthat was planned. The foster parents said FCW2 approved the\ntrip, then said she did not. Youth A reported he was a little\ndisappointed about not going, but was overall okay with it. Youth\nA denied ever hearing FCW2 say anything negative about either\nfoster parent or ever discuss foster care money. Youth A stated he\nnever heard any other youth in the home report FCW2 made\nnegative statements or discussed foster care money. Youth A\nstated he never heard FCW1 make any negative comments or\ndiscuss money either. Youth A reported he looked into an IL\nprogram with FCW2, but ultimately decided it was not for him.\nYouth A anticipated reunification to occur soon, which made IL\nseem unnecessary. Youth A reported he was never uncomfortable\nwhen working with FCW2. Youth A denied hearing FCW1 or\nFCW2 state, “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas”.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face on 4/9/25. Youth B reported\nliving in the foster home for about nine months. Youth B stated he\nenjoyed all of the activities the family did with the kids in the home.\nHowever, he disliked having some of his personal belongings\ntaken away, not being able to go outside alone, and losing access\nto the internet. Youth B discussed these concerns with FCW2\nafter the interview.\nWhen asked if there were any concerns about interactions\nbetween FCW1 or FCW2 and the foster parents, Youth B stated\nFoster Parent 2 said he hates the case workers and did not need\nfoster care money. Foster Parent 1 indicated to Youth B that they\ndid not like the workers either. Youth B shared he felt Foster\nParent 2 yelled at youth too much. Youth B indicated he was\nindifferent about the trip with the foster parents being canceled.\nYouth B stated he never heard FCW1 or FCW2 make negative\ncomments about either foster parent, or indicate they were\nfostering for money. Youth B never heard FCW1 or FCW2 state,\n“What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas”.\nYouth C was interviewed via video call on 4/29/25. Youth C\nreported the foster parents were great and there were no\nconcerns. Youth C reported they had no concerns about FCW2 or\nFCW1. When asked if there were any concerns between the\n11",
    "foster parents and staff, Youth C stated there was some\ndisrespect going both ways. When asked for an example, Youth C\ndid not have one. When asked specifically if FCW1 or FCW2 ever\nmade comments about fostering for money, Youth C responded\nyes. Youth C stated they were in the car with FCW2 once, when\nFCW2 was on the phone with FCS and said the foster parents\nwere doing foster care for the money. Youth C stated they did not\nhear FCW2 say that exactly, and they could not remember the\nspecific wording. Youth C stated they did not believe the foster\nparents were in it for the money. Youth C did not recall a time\nFCW1 made any statements about foster care money. Youth C\nreported Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 discussed that they\nfelt the agency was not treating them fairly. The foster parents felt\nboth FCW1 and FCW2 thought they were fostering for the money.\nYouth C denied FCW2 sharing any documents about foster care\npayments with them. When asked if FCW1 or FCW2 ever told\nYouth C or any other youth not to tell their foster parents\nsomething, Youth C answered no. Youth C then said FCW2 did\ntell the youth first about the trip not happening, and asked the\nyouth not to say anything, as FCW2 was going to inform the foster\nparents. Youth C reported they were upset about not going. But\nthe foster parents said they would take them once they turn 18.\nYouth C stated they never heard anyone say, “What happens in\nVegas, stays in Vegas.” Youth C reported FCW2 was a good\nworker and they felt comfortable talking openly with her about\nanything.\nDocuments Reviewed\n• Email dated 3/7/25 from foster parents requesting\nclarification for travel denial.\n• Email dated 3/7/25 to Licensing Supervisor and Foster\nCare Supervisor, reporting concerns related to FCW2.\n• Email dated 3/7/25 from foster parents to Licensing\nSupervisor, requesting a copy of their licensing file.\n• Case records for Youth A, Youth B and Youth C were\nreviewed.
