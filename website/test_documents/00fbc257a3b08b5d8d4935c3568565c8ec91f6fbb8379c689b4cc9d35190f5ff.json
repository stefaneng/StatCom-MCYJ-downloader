    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction, prevention;\nTitle prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159\nSection (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nDescription manner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth's behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth's\ntreatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that Youth A was restrained in an unsafe manner.\nInvestigation I spoke to Complainant 1 and Administrator 1 on 8/21/24. No\nadditional information was provided.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 8/21/24 at the facility. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A was outside with Staff 2 and Staff 3. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A was not listening to staff but wasn’t aggressive in\nbehavior. Staff 1 reported Youth A is young, and he was “playing”\naround. Staff 2 was talking on the phone and Youth A kept\nrepeating, “Let me talk to her.” Staff 3 pushed Youth A away from\nStaff 2 about 5 different times. Staff 1 described this action as\nextending one arm out towards Youth A and pushing him. Staff 1\nreported Youth A fell once during those pushes. After Youth A fell,\nhe went to hit Staff 3 with a stick he found on the ground. Staff 3\ngrabbed the stick and pushed Youth A to the ground. Youth A\nthen got up and ran from them and ended up in the parking lot.\nYouth A began touching cars in the parking lot and then Youth A\nbegan to lean against Staff 2’s car. Staff 2 then pushed Youth A\noff of the car. Youth A then went towards Staff 3 and started to\nkick his legs and attempt to push him. Youth A then attempted to\nbreak a branch off of a tree and Staff 3 pushed him to the ground\nby his neck area. Youth A fell to the ground. Staff 3 held him down\non the ground. Staff 1 reported Staff 3 was holding the side of his\nface down on the ground as well as placed one of his legs on\nYouth A’s legs to stop him from moving. Staff 1 reported Staff 2\nwas still on the phone and was not engaged physically with Youth\nA. Staff 3 then released Youth A and Youth A got up and ran\naround the building again. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 and Staff 3 then\n2",
    "attempted to verbally deescalate. Youth A did come back to\nbaseline.\nBoth Staff 2 and Staff 3 were administratively placed on leave\nafter this incident. I attempted phone calls and text messages on\n8/21/24, 8/22/24, 9/20/24 and 9/25/24. I did not receive a return\nphone call from Staff 3 and Staff 3 no longer works at the facility.\nOn 9/20/24, I spoke to Staff 2. Staff 2 reported she no longer\nworks at the facility and did not want to discuss the situation.\nDue to law enforcement involvement Youth A was not interviewed\nonsite. On 10/1/24 law enforcement gave the approval for outside\ninterviews.\nOn 10/23/24, I went to Youth A’s new placement for an interview.\nYouth A was not there to be interviewed. On 11/18/24, I went back\nto Youth A’s new placement and interviewed him face to face.\nYouth A reported he did not remember anything.\nVideo Reviewed:\nI watched the video of the incident on 8/17/24. Only part of the\nincident was on video. The time frame available was 11:53am-\n11:58am. In the video Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 were present\nwith Youth A. They were outside. Youth A had walked in front of\nall the staff. Staff 3 pushed Youth A from the back twice. After the\nsecond push, Youth A turned around and pushed Staff 3. Staff 3\nattempted to place Youth A in a standing hold but Youth A slipped\nout of the maneuver. Staff 3 then grabbed Youth A by the\nshoulders and held him, Youth A was able to remove himself from\nthis hold and grabbed a stick and hit Staff 3 with it across his\nbody. Staff 3 pushed Youth A to the ground and grabbed and\nthrew the stick away from Youth A, while holding Youth A onto the\nground. Staff 3 had held Youth A down to the ground near his\nupper shoulder/neck area. The exact area could not be\ndetermined by video.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• There were no documents of the incident to review. (See\nbelow citation)\n• I reviewed personnel files. Staff 1 and Staff 3 had all the\nappropriate training and clearances. (See below citation for\nStaff 2)\n• I reviewed the CPI manual. The agency’s Behavior\nManagement policy outlines CPI as their restraint model –\n3",
    "including Children’s Control Position and a Team Control\nPosition.\n• Youth A’s intake paperwork reported he was 4’6” and\n96lbs.\nAnalysis The agency is in violation of this rule. Staff 3 attempted to restrain\nYouth A without the assistance of another, which is unsafe. Staff 3\nshould have used a Children’s Control Position outlined in CPI. If\nthis move was not effective, Staff 3 could have used the Team\nControl position. Neither one of these holds were attempted.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was alleged to be pushed by Staff 1.\nInvestigation Staff 1 reported Staff 3 pushed Youth A away from Staff 2 about 5\ndifferent times.

Although Youth A was not\nfollowing the rules of the program, he was not aggressive in\nnature, nor was a threat to the staff involved in the situation due to\nhis stature. Youth A is considerably smaller than Staff 2 and Staff\n3. He is 4 6”, 93lbs and 12 years of age.
