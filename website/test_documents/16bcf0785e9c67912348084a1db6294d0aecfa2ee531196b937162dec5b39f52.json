This turned into a full physical altercation.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/3/2022 I reviewed the complaint; and spoke with Complainant Z. Complainant\nZ did not witness the incident. Youth B, a youth on Complainant Z’s caseload\nwitnessed the incident and videotaped it. Youth B sent the video to Complainant Z.\nComplainant Z reported in the video one can see a staff punch a youth in the face\n3",
    "and a fight ensues. Complainant Z agreed to forward me a copy of the video\nfootage.\nOn 2/3/2022 I spoke with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)\nWorker X related to the complaint; and I received notification from her that the\nagency had suspended Case Manager 3 pending the investigation. The latter was\nconfirmed by the agency.\nOn 2/4/2022, DHHS Worker X and I interviewed Youth A, Case Manager 2, Case\nManager 3, and Administrator 1 onsite at the agency’s administrative office. Youth\nWorker 4 was interviewed by us by telephone on 2/14/2022. All staff members\ninterviewed reported the incident happened sometime on or about 1/18/2022. All\nstaff members reported Youth Worker 4 called Administrator 1 to report the incident.\nAdditionally, all staff members denied observing any marks or bruises to Youth A;\nthey reported Case Manager 3 had a bruise to her eye either that day or the next\nday.\nInterview with Youth A:\nYouth A reported she was present at a meeting with Case Manager 2 and Case\nManager 3 at the agency’s Lakewood Independent Living (IL) home. The meeting\nwas a discussion centered on a resident’s food being taken or eaten; and Case\nManager 3 asked Youth A questions about that. Youth A got irritated by the\nquestioning; did not answer; and then she and Case Manager 3 argued. Youth A\nsaid Case Manager 3 stood in her face; was grabbing her person, her shirt; and she\ndoes not like people being in her face. She asked Case Manager 3 to back up from\nher. Case Manager 3 didn’t move back, and she pushed Case Manager 3. In turn,\nCase Manager 3 punched her in the face; and she started hitting Case Manager 3\nback. Youth A reported receiving a bump on her left eye from the incident. She said\nthe bump hurt but had no swelling or bruising. She reported the police came out, but\nshe was not sure who called the police. Youth A said, Case Manager 2 and Youth\nWorker 4 were at the house during the incident, but neither moved to intervene until\nshe started hitting Case Manager 3. Youth Worker 4 grabbed Case Manager 3; and\nCase Manager 2 grabbed her. Youth A reported Youth B was also present during the\nincident. Youth B recorded the incident; and sent it to Administrator 1 this week,\nbecause Administrator 1 requested it.\nYouth A reported talking with Administrator 1 about the incident after it occurred but\nnot Case Manager 2 who was her assigned case manager. Case Manager 2 did not\nfollow up with her about the incident or inquire about how she was doing or her\nsafety. Administrator 1 spoke with her, but she did not tell Administrator 1 about the\nfight or what happened during the fight. She assumed Administrator 1 knew there\nwas a fight, because Administrator 1 came to the house right after the fight.\nAdministrator 1 asked her what she wanted to do about what happened during the\nincident. She did not tell Administrator 1 that she wanted to do anything about it.\n4",
    "Interview with Case Manager 2:\nCase Manager 2 admitted to being present and witnessing the altercation between\nYouth A and Case Manager 3. She affirmed Youth A’s reporting related to a house\nmeeting, its purpose and that a physical altercation ensued between Youth A and\nCase Manager 3, whereby Youth A pushed Case Manager 3 and Case Manager 3 hit\nYouth A. Case Manager 2 reported she and Case Manager 3 were holding the\nmeeting around concerns over someone eating Youth D’s food (Youth D shares the\nupstairs part of this two-family flat with Youth A and Youth C. Youth B resides\ndownstairs). Youth A became defensive during the meeting and was yelling, calling\nCase Manager 2 and Case Manager 3 dumb and stupid for thinking she ate Youth\nD’s food. Youth A came from around the table to where Case Manager 3 was\nstanding and was yelling. Case Manager 3 told Youth A that Youth A was going to\nstop disrespecting her; was going to stop talking to her like that. Youth A began\nputting her hands in Case Manager 3’s face; and pushed Case Manager 3 hard. The\npush caused Case Manager 3 to lose her balance, almost fall; and Case Manager 3\nswung on Youth A. Case Manager 2 reported Case Manager 3 must have realized\nwhat she had done, because Case Manager 3 grabbed and held Youth A hands and\nwas telling Youth A to stop hitting her. It was at this point that Case Manager 2 said\nshe and Youth Worker 4 intervened. Youth Worker 4 grabbed Case Manager 3.\nCase Manager 2 took hold of Youth A and was taking Youth A away, but Youth A got\nloose from her. Youth A came around the back of Youth Worker 4 and hit Case\nManager 3 in the face. Youth A apologized to them(staff) the next day.\nCase Manager 2 reported Youth B recorded the incident, though she had advised\nYouth B not to. She said, Youth B was recording and verbally egging Youth A on.\nYouth B was telling Youth A to “whip the B’s ass”. Case Manager 2 reported seeing\nthe video footage but reported what she saw on the footage was only Case Manager\n3 hitting Youth A, not Youth A pushing and hitting Case Manager 3.\nInterview with Case Manager 3\nCase Manager 3 affirmed basically what was reported by Case Manager 2 related to\nthe house meeting, Youth A’s behaviors and actions during the incident. She said\nYouth A was cursing, calling them dumb “mother fuckers”. Youth A got into her face;\nYouth A used Youth A’s finger and poked her on the forehand twice. She asked\nYouth A to get out of her face three times. She said, “before I knew it, I did hit her”.\nThen she grabbed Youth A and put Youth A into a restraint so Youth A couldn’t hit\nher again. She reported her hit on Youth A was “like a slap on the face, not a punch”.\nShe said, Youth A had pushed her, knocked her off her feet and she could have fell.\nShe said, “that push affected me”. She said when she grabbed Youth A, Youth\nWorker 4 and Case Manager 2 separated her and Youth A. Youth Worker 4 held her\nand was telling her to calm down. She said, Case Manager 2 grabbed Youth A, but\nYouth A broke loose from Case Manager 2. Youth A ran and hit her in the face, near\nher forehead, just over the left eye. She said, Youth Worker 4 continued to tell her to\ncalm down. She said, “I wanted to attack her. I was angry”. She admitted that before\nthe physical incident between she and Youth A, Youth Worker 4, got up and offered\n5",
    "to assist, but she told him “We’re good”. She said that was because she thought they\nwere, that she was handling the situation.\nCase Manager 3 denied going after Youth A when Youth A came around Youth\nWorker 4 and hit her. She reported Youth Worker 4 held her and was getting her\ncalmed down. She reported she “had never been hit by a kid” before, and she was\ntaken back by it. She said she would not do anything to hurt a child; she wants to\nopen a home for children.\nInterview with Administrator 1:\nAdministrator 1 affirmed being contacted by Youth Worker 4 about the incident on the\nday of the incident. Additionally, that she spoke with Youth A and inquired about what\nhappened and whether Youth A needed to go to the hospital. Youth A informed her,\nYouth A and Case Manager 3 had a fight and Case Manager 2 and Youth Worker 4\nbroke it up. Youth A admitted to Administrator 1 that Case Manager 3 hit her, but\ndenied she was punched or slapped by Case Manager 3. Youth A said, no to\nneeding to go to the hospital for any medical attention. Administrator 1 told Youth A\nAdministrator 1 needed to call Centralize Intake about the incident and Youth A did\nnot want her to. Youth A said she was in the wrong; that she was mad and cursed\nCase Manager 3 because the staff was accusing her of taking Youth D’s food. Youth\nA said she got in Case Manager 3’s face and pushed Case Manager 3.\nAdministrator 1 reported she also spoke with Case Manager 3 on the day of the\nincident. Case Manager 3 said she was not trying to hurt Youth A; that Youth A\nnever would have gone as far as Youth A had if Youth B had not been egging Youth\nA on. Administrator 1 had Case Manager 3 and Youth A “to talk it out”. At that point\nAdministrator 1 thought the matter was resolved.\nInterview with Youth Worker 4:\nYouth Worker 4 reported the incident was about Youth A disrespecting the staff. He\nsaid he was in the other room and could hear what was being said. Youth A was\nreferring to staff as “Bitches”. Youth A got up and put her hand in Case Manager 3’s\nface; and Case Manager 3 asked Youth A to get her hand out her face. Youth\nWorker 4 said, he got up and got in between the youth and case manager, because\nhe did not know what either’s intentions were. At that point Case Manager 3 told him\n“I got this”. Case Manager 3 grabbed Youth A’s hands, then let them go. Thereon,\nYouth Worker 4 described the push and what happened after the push as Case\nManager 2 had. He said, Case Manager 3 may have hit Youth A in the chest/head\narea. Case Manager 3 also grabbed and tried to restraint Youth A. He grabbed Case\nManager 3 but had to let Case Manager 3 go when Youth A hit him in the back of the\nhead. He said, Youth A was the aggressor. He said, he took Case Manager 3 into\nthe other room to talk with her. He denied that Case Manager 3 ever tried to go after\nYouth A after he and Case Manager 2 separated the two. He said, Youth D was\nalso in the house, but he was not sure whether Youth D witnessed any of the\nincident. Youth Worker 4 was not aware of any other incident between Youth A and\nCase Manager 3.\n6",
    "Youth Worker 4 reported the police did not come to the home. He did call the police,\nhe called Administrator 1 about the incident. Administrator 1 did not instruct him to\ncall the police or Centralized Intake. Nor did Administrator 1 say she would attend to\nthose contacts. Administrator 1 advised him to write an incident report, which he did\non the day of the incident. Administrator 1 and Case Manager 3 returned to the\nhome, and had a meeting with Youth A, later that day. He was not aware of what\noccurred in that meeting.\nOn 2/14/2022 I spoke with Youth A’s purchase of service worker, DHHS-Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) X0. DHHS- FCW X0 reported being aware of the incident. She\nreceived incident reports from the agency about the matter sometime on or about\n1/22/2022. She had no further information about the matter.\nOn 3/3/2022, a second DHHS Worker, DHHS Worker XX and I interviewed Youth B\nonsite at the Juvenile Detention Facility. Youth B affirmed taking the video of the\nincident. She reported information similar to Youth A, Case Manager 2, and Case\nManager 3 related to the incident. She described the physical action by Case\nManager 3 as Case Manager 3 punching Youth A and putting Youth A into a head\nlock. She said no one called the police. She admitted to filming the video of the\nincident and sending it to her probation worker and DHHS worker.\nReviewed:\n Incident report statements from Youth Worker 4, Case Manager 2, Case\nManager 3, and Administrator 1, all typed and dated 1/18/2022, which:\n Was a version of basically what each reported when they were\ninterviewed.\n All indicated management was contacted about the incident; and all\nexcept, Case Manager 3 indicating the police were not contacted.\n All indicated Youth A was cursing; and or that Youth A made a\nstatement about being able to say “What the Fuck” she wants because\nshe is grown.\n All indicated Youth A pushed Case Manager 3 and Case Manager 3\nhit Youth A.\n Video footage received from Complainant Z which showed the following\n The camera trying to focus, and Youth A being heard saying you sound\nstupid; and Case Manager 3 responding but I cannot tell what that\nresponse was.\n Youth A and Case Manager 3 standing facing each other with some\nspace between them, that quickly closed as the incident advanced\nonward.\n Youth A telling Case Manager 3 to “Shut the fuck up”; and Case Manager\n3 responded, with “Make me”.\n7",

    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: Youth A, Case Manager 2, Youth Worker 4, Youth B, as well as\nCase Manager 3 all reported Case Manager 3, hit or punched\nYouth A.\nCase Manager 3 admitted to being angry and wanting to attack\nYouth A. She denied attacking, punching, or trying to go after\nYouth A once she and Youth A were separated.\nThe video footage showed:\n Case Manager 3 hit Youth A’s hand down when Youth\nA put her hand up toward Case Manager 3’s face.\n Case Manager 3 grabbed Youth A arms, and held\nthem; pulled on Youth A’s shirt, and slightly pushed\nYouth A’s arm backward.\n Case Manager 3 spoke loudly/ not in a calming tone,\nwas antagonistic, and unprofessional during her\ninteraction with Youth A. Case Manager 3 stepped\ncloser into Youth A’s personal space while telling\nYouth A she had asked Youth A not to invade her own\npersonal space. Case Manager 3 told Youth A to\nmake her when Youth A asked her to move out her\npersonal space.\n Case Manager 3 cursed at Youth A, told Youth A she\nwas not “Backing Up Shit”, twice.\n9",
    " Case Manager 3 punched Youth A in the face with\nCase Manager 3’s fist. She also grabbed Youth A\naround the neck and held Youth A in a headlock.\n When Youth Worker 4 and Case Manager 2\nintervened to break up the altercation, Case Manager\n3 did not stop or walk away. She continued to try to go\nafter Youth A. She hit across Youth Worker 4 to strike\nat Youth A.\n After Youth A broke free and hit Case Manager 3\nagain, Case Manager 3 went after Youth A, when at\nthat point Youth A was being taken away from her.\nThis action by Case Manager 3 caused Youth Worker\n4 to grab Case Manager 4 again; and Case Manager\n3 tried to break free of Youth Worker 4 to advance\ntoward Youth A.\nCase Manager 3 did not try to deescalate the incident. Her\nverbal and physical actions escalated the incident with an\nescalated Youth A. Case Manager 3’s cursing at and putting\nher hands on Youth A; as well as her trying to restraint Youth A,\npunching Youth A in the face, and putting Youth A in a\nchokehold all illustrate Case Manager 3 did not have the ability,\nexperience, education, and training to perform the duties\nassigned.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\n(1) During the investigation it was revealed the agency did not report the staff/resident\nphysical altercation; and Case Manager 3 hitting Youth A to Centralized Intake.\nDHHS Worker X and I interviewed Case Manager 2, Case Manager 3, and\nAdministrator 1 onsite on 2/4/2022. Youth Worker 4 was interviewed by us by telephone\non 2/14/2022. All four staff members reported that they did not report the incident of\nYouth A being hit/ being in a physical altercation with Case Manager 3 to children\nservices.\nCase Manager 2 acknowledged knowing she is a mandated reporter; but rationalized\nnot doing so. She said things were blown out of proportion. Youth A was being loud\naggressive, and the incident was being egged on by Youth B. Additionally that Case\nManager 3 apologized.\nCase Manager 3 reported not knowing they were mandated to report the incident to\nCentralized Intake.\n10",
    "Youth Worker 4 reported he was not advised by Administrator 1 to call Centralized\nIntake.\nAdministrator 1 acknowledged Youth A admitted that Case Manager 3 hit her, but Youth\nA denied she was punched or slapped by Case Manager 3. Administrator 1 reported\nadvising Youth A that Administrator 1 needed to call the incident in to Centralized\nIntake. Administrator 1 reported the following reasons as to why she did not call\nCentralized Intake. Youth A did not want her to; Youth A took responsibility for the\nincident, said she was wrong for getting in Case Manager 3’s face; and pushing Case\nManager 3, when Case Manager 3 kept trying to talk with her; Youth A and Case\nManager 3 had a good relationship; Case Manager 3 reported she was not trying to\nhurt Youth A; the two talked it out and Administrator 1 felt the matter was resolved.\nAdditionally, Administrator 1 did not know the severity of the incident until she saw the\nvideo that Youth B’s probation officer sent to her on 1/31/2022. At that latter date\nAdministrator 1 suspended Case Manager 3. She reported suspending Case Manager\n3 from her job pending the complaint investigation, due to Case Manager 3 restraining\nand hitting Youth A. She denied past disciplinary actions for Case Manager 3. She\nstated Case Manager 3 is a good employee who does well with the children.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12214 Compliance with 1975 PA 238.\nAn agency shall develop a written plan and implement the plan\nto assure compliance with 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.621, and\nknown as the child protection law.\nANALYSIS: Youth A affirmed to Administrator 1 Case Manager 3 hit her.\nCase Manager 2, Youth Worker 4, as well as Case Manager 3\nalso affirmed the physical altercation between Youth A and\nCase Manager 3 and that Youth A was hit by Case Manager 3\nduring the physical altercation. All the stated staff members\nreported they did not report the incident to children services, or\nthe police with respect to possible maltreatment of Youth A.\nThe agency failed to report the physical assault on Youth A by a\nstaff member, as required by the rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n(2) During the investigation it was revealed Case Manager 3 restrained or tried to\nrestrain Youth A. Restraining a youth is not a part of the agency’s behavioral\nmanagement plan.\nDHHS Worker X and I interviewed, Case Manager 2, Case Manager 3, and\nAdministrator 1 onsite on 2/4/2022. Youth Worker 4 was interviewed by us by\n11",

She reported the agency does not have a policy authorizing the use\nof restraints. She reported she is to call the police if the youth is in a physical\naltercation; but the agency training does not advise her what to do if she as a staff is\nattacked by a youth. She never envisioned such happening. She reported reacting in\nthe moment; and her restraining Youth A was a reflect. She learned how to restrain via\nthe Oak Park Police Department in 2011. No updated restraint training was reported by\nher. She reported no prior training on de-escalation, nor could she recall conflict\nresolution training.\nAdministrator 1 reported they do not have a restraint policy. She stated “We don’t\nrestrain. We call the police.” She indicated that prior to any training on de-escalation\nthe staff are advised to retreat, not to get into a physical altercation.\nReviewed\n A copy of the agency’s Discipline Policy which indicated:\n Staff may utilize the following behavior management techniques:\n Positive Reinforcement.\n Trauma Informed Care Approach.\n Crisis Intervention.\n Prohibited approaches. The following techniques are prohibited to manage\na resident in any type of distress (emotionally, mentally, or physically):\n (1).
