INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12204 Facilities\nSection (3) An organization may maintain satellite offices when the\nDescription following conditions are met:\n(a) The agency has notified the department in writing prior to\nopening the satellite office and has received approval to open the\nsatellite office.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\n1",
    "Allegation The agency opened a satellite office without notifying DCWL.\nInvestigation DCWL staff completed on-site inspection on January 22,\n2024. Upon entering the office building for an unrelated matter,\nDCWL noticed an office with a Wellspring sign. DCWL staff sent\nan email to Associate Director to inquire and was told the office is\nbeing used as a satellite office for the Wellspring Kentwood\nlicense which had not been previously reported.\nAssociate Director (AD) was interviewed on January 25, 2024,\nvia telephone. She stated there was some confusion within the\nagency as to what constitutes a satellite office. AD stated they are\nstill working towards becoming a fully functional satellite office and\nhad intended on notifying DCWL once the set up was completed.\nThe office was initially opened to accommodate Family\nPreservation and Supportive Visitation contracts. She stated there\nare one or two staff who occasionally work out of the office and\nthere is also some parent visitation being held for Muskegon\ncases. AD stated the agency was not aware DCWL needed to be\nnotified earlier even with limited activities and staffing.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance as they opened a satellite\nlocation in Norton Shores without obtaining prior approval from\nDCWL as required.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n______1/26/2024_____________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 26, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n2",

    "level": "low",
    "justification": "The substantiated violation is an administrative paperwork/policy compliance error where the agency failed to obtain prior written approval from the licensing department before opening a satellite office. This aligns with the low severity criteria for 'Administrative or paperwork issues' and 'Policy compliance errors (non-safety)' as it involves a reporting and approval failure with no associated safety, violence, restraint, medical, rights denial, or supervision concerns."
