    "ALLEGATION:\nOFA received a phone call that foster parent 1 hasn't been receiving payments\nfor foster Child A since child has been in her care. The foster parent has\nreceived two payments for foster child B since October (2018).\nINVESTIGATION:\nFoster Parent 1 was interviewed. She reported she has been a foster parent for\nHomes for Black Children (HFBC) for nine years. She said she never had any\nissues with payments until a year ago and payments began to come sporadically or\nnot at all. She said she complained to her assigned foster care worker who informed\nher that she would inform her administration because she had nothing to do with\nfunding of the agency or payments to foster parents. Foster Parent 1 said she\ntalked with the president of the agency, and payments continued to move slowly for\nfoster child B. she said she never had a problem receiving payments for foster Child\nA. She said it was after she made the allegation mentioned above things started\nmoving and she was able to receive payments for foster child B. She said she\nreceived a lump sum payment from the agency. Foster Parent 1 said she did not\nwant to get the agency into trouble but if she was doing her part of fostering children\nin her home, she expected payments to assist in taking care of the children placed in\nher home. Foster Parent 1 said she was all caught up with her foster care payments\nat this point and that she does not have any additional information to add. She said\nif she did not receive her payments on a consistent basis, she would call this\nconsultant back to discuss her payments.\nFoster Child A, age 8, was placed in the home of Foster Parent 1 on 08/27/2017. A\nreview of the agency payment schedule from the agency accountant show\nconsistent payments from the agency to foster parent 1. There appeared to be no\nproblems with the payment for foster child A. Foster Parent 1 admitted that she did\nnot have any payment issues from the agency in regard to foster child A.\nFoster Child B, age 2, was placed in the home of Foster Parent 1 on 09/29/2018. A\nreview of the agency payment schedule from the agency accountant showed the\nfollowing reimbursement to foster parent 1 for foster child B:\nPeriod Period Days Daily Difficulty/Level Amount Paid Date Check# Balance\nPaid Paid To Paid Rate Rate\nFrom\n09/29/18 09/30/18 2 $17.24 $0.00 $34.48 34.48\n10/01/18 10/31/18 31 $17.24 $0.00 $534.44 534.44\n11/01/18 11/30/18 30 $17.24 $0.00 $517.20 517.20\n12/01/18 12/31/18 31 $17.24 $0.00 $534.44 1,068.88 06/14/19 50588 (534.44)\nXMAS $25.00 2,607.28 04/26/19 50468 (2,582.28)\n01/01/19 01/31/19 31 $17.24 $0.00 $534.44 534.44\n02/01/19 02/28/19 28 $17.24 $0.00 $482.72 1,068.88 04/19/19 50444 (586.16)\nClothing Allow. $107.00 107.00\n3",

It is shown with this schedule that the checks were not\nsubmitted to the foster parent timely.\nThe director reported that Foster child B was placed with the agency on September\n29, 2018 and her first payment was received from the department on February 13,\n2019. According to the director, she provided the check amount to the foster parent in\nthe amount of 1,068.88.\nA review of payments for foster child A from the accountant of the agency indicates\nthat a check went out to the foster parent on a regular basis for foster child A.\nThe director was interviewed onsite. She acknowledges difficulty with cash flow\nstemming from reductions from both foster care and adoption placements for 2017\nand 2018. She reported she responded to her service reduction by decreasing its\nexpenses by downsizing the reduction of staff. She reports the current staffing pattern\nallows for a maximum of 33 foster care placement and the agency has 30 active foster\ncare cases.\nThe director further reported that the agency failure to receive timely approval for\npayments from the department added to her cash flow problems. She reported that\nhalf of her foster care population payments were delayed for more than two months.\nShe said she takes full responsibility in not following the protocol of getting the\ndelayed payments taken care of sooner by not following the departments policy and\nprocedure for payments. She identified the following foster children delayed payment\nschedule:\nFoster Child Name: Child Placement Date: Funding Received:\n1. Foster Child C 3/1/2019 5/15/2019\n2.

    "It should be noted that the agency was in non - compliance with special investigation\n#2019C0201018 for not following Contract PAFC 50001 – Placing Agency foster care\npolicy. The report was dated May 24, 2019 whereby the agency submitted a corrective\naction plan. The corrective action plan was dated 06/11/2019. The agency is still in the\nprocess of correcting the funding issues with the foster parents.\nTo date the agency reported they are behind in three foster care payments. The\ndirector reported she will be up to date with all payments by the end of August 2019.\nThe director identified the three foster parents and the amount of payments owed as\nfollowing:\nFoster Parent: Type of Placement: Amount Owed:\nFoster Parent 2 Licensed Foster Home 1,400.00\nFoster Parent 3 Licensed Foster Home 2,200.00\nFoster Parent 4 Unlicensed relative 3,400.00\nThe agency three foster care workers were interviewed onsite regarding foster care\npayments.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported she is assigned foster parent 1 case. She reported\nfoster parent 1 complained to her about her payments not being timely or that she was\nnot receiving her payments at all from the agency for foster child B. She said she\nreported the information to the agency administration. This foster parent made a\ncomplaint on the agency. She said the foster parent told her that due to a complaint\nshe made on the agency, she has been paid and is up to date on payments for the\nfoster children in her home.\nFoster Care Worker 2 was interviewed onsite. She reported that none of her foster\nparents has complained to her regarding payments or not getting paid from the agency.\nShe offered no other information.\nFoster Care worker 3 was interviewed onsite. She reported that none of her assigned\nfoster parents on her case load has complained to her about not getting paid from the\nagency.

She reported she has been a foster\nparent for the agency since 2/16/2017. She reported when she became a foster parent\nwith the agency, she had no issues with payments. She said within the last year the\nagency has been slow with payments. She said she does not get her payments\nconsistently but when the agency give her a check it’s a lump sum. She said the\nagency does not stick to a schedule. She said she might get a check on the 15th of the\nmonths and then she might get a check towards the end of the month. Foster Parent 2\n5",
    "said she does not complain because she knows she will get paid and that everybody\nhas money issues from time to time. She said she wish she knew a date of when she\nwill receive a check. She had no other information to provide.\nFoster Parent 3 was interviewed onsite. She has been a foster parent with the agency\nsince 11/29/2016. She reported the agency owes her money and that she is discussing\nthe issue with the administration. She was not sure of how much money she is owed.\nShe said she does not get consistent payments but that she does get a check from time\nto time.\nFoster Parent 4 was interviewed via telephone. She reported she has been a foster\nparent with the agency since 9/23/2015. She said she is adopting her two nephews and\nthat she was not expecting any money. She said when she received a check from the\nagency she was surprised because all she wanted to do was take care of her two\nnephews. She said to her knowledge the agency does not owe her any money. She\nreported she gets a check regularly. Foster Parent 4 said she does not have any\ncomplaints on the agency at this time. She said her department worker informed her\nthat she should be getting payments for caring for her nephews and that her worker\nmade a complaint regarding this issue. She said after the complaint, she was given a\ncheck from the agency and they continue to come on a regular basis. She has no\nadditional information.\nFoster Parent 5 was interviewed via telephone. She has been a foster parent since\n12/20/2016. She reported that she does not have any issues with the agency. She said\nshe gets a check monthly. Her only complaint is that the agency is not consistent with\nthe payment dates.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nCONTRACT – Placing Agency Foster Care\nPAFC 19-50001\nWhen the contractor’s financial records reveal that\npayment for a child has not been provided by MDHHS\nwithin 30 days of receiving all necessary documentation,\nthe contractor will seek payment resolution by\ncontacting the direct supervisor of the assigned MDHHS\nworker in writing. Any concerns over a payment\nauthorization or issuance that cannot be resolved within\n30 days of the written notice must be reported to the\nMDHHS county director for immediate resolution. The\ncontractor will apprise MDHHS office of child welfare\nservices and support of any ongoing, unresolved\npayment concerns.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency did not utilize the placement agency foster care\ncontract for the children who the agency had not receive\npayments for within 30 days. It is a fact that the agency payment\nschedule and payments to foster parents is ineffective and\nneeds to be revised.\nFurther the agency has not developed a foster parent payment\nschedule despite signing 3600s which states, “The contract\nagency must forward the age appropriate rate to the foster\nparent in accordance with the contract agency’s foster parent\npayment schedule.” Contract language requires the agency to\ndevelop a foster parent payment schedule.\nIt should be noted that a complaint was initiated on the agency\nin March 2019. The report was submitted to the agency on May\n2019, complaint #2019C02002018 and the agency submitted a\nCAP on 06/11/2019. This complaint came in on 05/08/2019. It\nhas been 2 months and the agency is still in the process of\ncorrecting this violation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency has not obtained an annual audit of all financial accounts as of\nMay 2019.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR400.4108 Financing and audit.\nRule 108. A licensee shall do all of the following:\n(a) Obtain an annual audit of all financial accounts. Audits\nfor nongovernmental institutions shall be conducted\nby an independent certified public accountant who is\nnot administratively related to the agency.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: It should be noted per special investigation\n#2019C0201018, the agency was in violation of not\nobtaining their independent annual audit of their financial\naccounts as of May 2019 for fiscal year 2016 and 2017.\nThe independent audit has been completed and sent to\nthe state of Michigan. In a discussion with the executive\ndirector via telephone, she reported that the auditors\nreported a (Going concern). The executive director also\nreported there was a deficit of $400, 000 for the year of\n2016 and a reduction in the deficit to $70, 000 for fiscal\nyear 2017. The executive director anticipates further\nreductions for the fiscal year 2018 and 2019.\nIt is noted that the State of Michigan has received a copy\nof Homes for Black Children internal audit for years 16\nand 17.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon an acceptable corrective action plan and time to correct this violation, I\nrecommend Homes for Black Children continue with their regular license.\n08/20/2019\n________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 16, 2019\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n8"
