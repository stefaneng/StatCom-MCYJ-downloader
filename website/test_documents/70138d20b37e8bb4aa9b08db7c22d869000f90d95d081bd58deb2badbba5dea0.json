    "program statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff fell asleep at the McLaren Hospital while supervising Youth\nA.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant 1 was emailed on 3/17/25. She reported she\nreceived the allegations from hospital staff. Names of the hospital\nstaff were provided and noted as the following complainants.\nComplainant 2, Complainant 3, and Complainant 4 were\nemailed on 3/17/25. Complainant 2 responded on 3/25/25. He\nreported in a group email, they did not see the agency staff\nsleeping while they supervised Youth A, but did have a picture\nthat was given to them by a hospital staff. Complainant 2 reported\nhe had sent the photograph to Administrator 1.\nOn 3/19/25, I interviewed Administrator 1. Administrator 1\nreported she was aware of the allegations and in fact were in the\nprocess of providing Staff 1 and Staff 2 disciplinary action for their\nactions at the hospital.\nOn 3/28/25, I interviewed Staff 1 via telephone. Staff 1 reported\nshe supervised Youth A at the Mclaren hospital and did fall asleep\nwhen there.\nOn 3/28/25, I interviewed Staff 2 via telephone. Staff 2 reported\nshe did not fall asleep at the hospital and refused to sign her\nwritten disciplinary action.\nOn 4/1/25, Youth A was interviewed face to face at the facility and\nrefused to talk to me about the hospital.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• On 3/28/25 Administrator 1 sent me the picture of Staff 1\nsleeping in a chair at the hospital. Staff 1 had a blanket\naround her and her eyes closed.\n• Progressive Notification Form (2). Staff 1 and Staff 2 both\nreceived disciplinary points for sleeping at the hospital\nwhile supervising Youth A. The documents noted Staff 1 fell\nasleep on 3/12/25 and Staff 2 was noted to fall asleep on\n2",
    "3/11/25. It is noted that Staff 2 refused to sign the\ndisciplinary action.\n• I reviewed the agency’s “Children Supervision Policy.”\nResidential staff are expected to maintain and document\ndirect visual contact of children they will be supervising.\nStaff are always to remain “awake” and “alert.”\n• I reviewed both Staff 1 and Staff 2 personnel files. Both\nstaff had up to date central registry and both had sufficient\ntraining in accordance with licensing rules. Both staff\nreceived “Off Grounds Training” due to this incident on\n3/22/25.\nAnalysis The agency is noncompliant with this rule. Staff 1 did not provide\nfor the supervision of the child at the hospital. Staff 1 admitted to\nsleeping at the hospital and the photograph provided by\nComplainant 2 supported this. There is no evidence to validate\nStaff 2 was asleep at the hospital. The “Children’s Supervision\nPolicy” states staff are to be awake and alert during their\nsupervision of children.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n4/17/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
