    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention Standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(iii) Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or\notherwise suggesting physical or emotional harm to a\nyouth.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Supervisor 1 grabbed Youth A’s throat and Youth A sustained a\nscratch.\nInvestigation I spoke to Administrator 1 on 1/9/2024 and discussed\nallegations. No new information was provided.\nI left a voicemail for Complainant 1 on 1/9/2024. I have not\nreceived a call back at this time.\nI left a voicemail for JJ Worker 1 on 1/9/2024. I have not received\na call back at this time.\nI spoke to DHHS Worker 1 on 1/9/2024. Allegations and\nscheduling were discussed.\nInterviews were conducted face to face at the facility with\nDHHS Worker 1 on 1/12/2024:\nYouth A\nYouth A reported he had a computer from school in his backpack.\nHe was searched and his computer was found by staff. Supervisor\n1 told him he needed to give him the computer and Youth A\nreported he needed it for school. Supervisor 1 called him “slow”\nand Youth A reported Supervisor 1 was mocking his intelligence.\nYouth A reported he was frustrated and slammed his hands on the\ndesk. Youth A reported Supervisor 1 grabbed his neck and let him\ngo quickly. Youth A reported Supervisor 1 left a mark on his neck.\nI observed the mark to be a one-half inch scratch on his neck.\nYouth A reported he did not attempt to punch Supervisor 1 and\nSupervisor 1 did not touch him anywhere else. Youth A reported\nhe told Administrator 1 what happened in the unit and then\nAWOL’d.\n2",
    "Supervisor 1\nSupervisor 1 reported he was at the front desk when Youth A\nasked about his laptop. Supervisor 1 reported they could not give\nit to him because he was not supposed to have it. Supervisor 1\nreported Youth A clenched his fist, yelled at him and walked\ntowards him. Supervisor 1 reported he told Youth A, “I’m not going\nto get hit” and put up both of his fists in a fighting stance to block\nhimself from being hit if Youth A went after him. Supervisor 1\nreported he then “extended his arm” to block Youth A from getting\nnear him. Supervisor 1 reported he never touched Youth A.\nSupervisor 1 reported he never grabbed Youth A’s throat or\nscratched him. Supervisor 1 reported he did not follow the\nbehavior management plan that is taught at the facility. Supervisor\n1 reported he has not been trained to put up his fists in order to\nblock someone. Supervisor 1 reported he should have left the\narea. Supervisor 1 reported he never name called Youth A.\nSupervisor 1 reported he was recently hit by youth and was on\nmedical leave for that separate incident. Supervisor 1 was\nadamant that he was not going to be hit by youth again. It was\nasked if he was able to still do his job with that mentality and he\nwas unsure.\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 said he was present during this incident; however, he was\nengaged in completing other tasks during this time. Therefore, he\ndid not observe any physical interactions between Youth A and\nSupervisor 1.\nVideo Review:\nI reviewed the video for the allegations on 1/8/2024. Youth A and\nSupervisor 1 were at the staff table. Supervisor 1 pointed his\nfinger at Youth A while walking towards him. Youth A did not yell\nor move towards Supervisor 1. Supervisor 1 was verbally engaged\nwith Youth A. Youth A slapped his hands on the table and then\nbrought his right hand down in front of his body. Supervisor 1\nblocked Youth A’s right arm with his left hand and then Supervisor\n1 extended his left arm out towards Youth A and pushed him\nback. Video footage was viewed from two directions. Both views\nshow Youth A being pushed back.\nDocuments:\n• Supervisor 1 personal file: All trainings and clearances\nwere up to date, and he had no disciplinary action in his\nfile.\n3",
    "• Medical Document: Body Chart completed on 1/13/2024.\nYouth A had redness, but the nurse wrote it could be from\nacne as well. Report stated Youth A claimed Supervisor 1\nattempted to grab his neck, but Youth A was able to pull\naway.\n• Incident reports dated 1/8/2024: None of the documents\nreported the aggressive behavior between Youth A and\nSupervisor 1.\n• Incident Report #1: At 4:05pm Youth A AWOL’d, no\nphysical management reported, no injury.\n• Incident report #2: At 4:30pm Youth A was caught\nstealing, no injury. Both incident reports were written on\n1/8/2024.\n• Principles of Disengagement for Crisis Prevention\nrestraint module. Pushing is not a disengagement\ntechnique.\nAnalysis Based on interviews with Youth A and Supervisor 1, Supervisor 1\ndid not follow behavior management techniques taught by the\nagency. Supervisor 1 reported he put his fists up and extended his\narm to block Youth A. The video clearly shows Supervisor 1\npointing his finger at Youth A while walking towards him and\nverbally engaged. Although Youth A made movement with his\nhand towards Supervisor 1, Supervisor 1 did not use the\ntechniques outlined in CPI to disengage. By his own admission,\nSupervisor 1 reported he was not taught to react this way and\nshould have left the area. Supervisor 1’s body language and\nmovement towards Youth A did not aid in deescalating the\nsituation. His behaviors were threatening in manner.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms\nof intervention:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a\nyouth’s background or appearance or mental state. Yelling,\nthreats, ridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Supervisor 1 allegedly used derogatory names towards Youth A.\nInvestigation Interviews were conducted face to face at the facility with\nDHHS Worker 1 on 1/12/2024:\n4",
