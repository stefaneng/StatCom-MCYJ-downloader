Seconds later\nTherapist 2 stepped in to assist making it a two person hold. The\ntwo-person hold took place for a minute and a half. Youth A\ndropped his weight and Youth A was released from the 2- person\nhold. Youth A then sat on the ground. Once on the ground, Youth\nA attempted to run into the street again, so Therapist 2 and Staff 2\nplaced Youth A back into a two person hold. Seconds later,\nTherapist 1 and Staff 1 arrived. Therapist 2 switched positions\nwith Therapist 1 and contacted the unit nurse. Therapist 1 and\nStaff 2 held Youth A from 4:45 PM to 4:59 PM.

Staff 1 and\nTherapist 1 approached the scene and Therapist 1 swapped with\nTherapist 2. Therapist 2 reported calling nursing department at\nthis time because that is the facility policy. Youth A was still\nrefusing to go back to the building (unit) but in a few minutes,\nTherapist 1 and Staff 2 convinced Youth A to begin walking back\ntowards the building. Therapist 1 and Staff 2 released their hold\non Youth A because Youth A had begun to willingly walk back.\nOnce Youth A, Therapist 1, Therapist 2, Staff 1, and Staff 2\nentered the milieu of the unit, Youth A began punching and hitting\nTherapist 1.
