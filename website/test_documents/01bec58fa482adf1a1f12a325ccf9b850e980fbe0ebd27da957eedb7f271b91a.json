    "summary": "An investigation was conducted into allegations that a supervisor at a youth facility struck two residents, caused injuries, and used threats and blind spots to avoid detection. The investigation included interviews with multiple youths, staff, and administrators, as well as reviews of video footage and incident reports. The investigation found that the accused supervisor was not working at the times of the alleged incidents, no other witnesses corroborated the claims, and the documented injuries were attributed to other causes like fights between youth. Based on the evidence, the allegations were not substantiated, and the facility was found in compliance; therefore, the accused supervisor is not deemed culpable based on this report's findings.",
