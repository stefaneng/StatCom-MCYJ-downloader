    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was 1 substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nSpecial evaluation 2023C0000787 was initiated on 7/11/2023 regarding a licensed\nfoster parent having an altercation with her biological daughter. Foster parent left the\nlocation while intoxicated with four foster children in the car placed in her care. A\ntraffic stop was initiated, and the foster parent was observed to have glossy eyes and\nintoxicants could be smelled coming from the vehicle. It is alleged that the foster\nparent was transferred to jail and blew a 0.111. The evaluation was very well written,\nand revocation of the foster home license was initiated, however, still pending.\nThere was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nSpecial evaluation #2024SEC0001383 was initiated on 2/27/2024 regarding the\nfoster child refusing to take her medication and the foster parent hit the foster child\non her face and told the foster child that she hated her. The foster child had a red\nmark on her face. The evaluation was thorough and well written. The foster parent\nwas using corporal punishment as discipline. The license foster parents were found\nin violation of licensing rules and agency policy. Revocation of the foster home\nlicense was initiated, however, still pending.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the individual CAP is as follows.\nThe one CAP submitted was in response to the interim inspection completed on\n8/21/23 and the CAP was approved on 8/23/2023. The agency was cited for one\nviolation, 722-08D – PATP Signatures. There was a decrease from 16 of 20\nPATP’s in 2023 to 4 of 8 PATP’s in 2024. The agency will need to complete\nadditional planning/training to reduce the repeated violation for PATP’s and ensure\ncompliance with this violation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) was reviewed and discussed onsite\non 5/2/2024. The chief administrator indicated the foster care staff have made\nimprovements with their last interim CAP. She stated the foster care supervisors\nare discussing the interim CAP during supervision and the foster care staff are\ndouble checking for missed signatures during their quarterly reports utilizing the\nMiSACWIS checklist. She stated that needed signatures are discussed during\nteam meetings also. She stated the program manager/director maintains a list of\nall PATPs and the due dates for reports and discusses them during the weekly\nfoster care meetings. This process seems to be helping the foster care staff to",
    "maintain compliance. The CA said the clerical department has been assisting as\nwell as PATPs are not able to be uploaded without appropriate signatures\nindicated on the document.\nThe CA stated that barriers and systemic factors that have impacted rules, ISEP,\npolicy and contract compliance are workers continuing to require reminders to\nobtain all signatures on PATPs within the required timeframe. She said however,\nthere has been some improvement in this area as the supervisors and director are\nreviewing the spreadsheet weekly during team meetings. The CA said the workers\nare not consistently completing tasks timely per policy and ISEP. Other barriers\ninclude the supervisory oversight through the use of monthly supervision,\nMiSACWIS checklist, weekly foster care team meetings and reviewing databases\nand spreadsheets. The CA said regular check-ins/emails and supervisors/program\nmanager have had to maintain direct foster care cases when there were staffing\nissues/shortage, which led to oversight issues because the supervisor/program\nmanager having reduced time to focus on supervisory tasks with the new workers.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency certified independent auditor’s report dated September 30, 2023, and\nthe agency annual financial report was reviewed. There were no financial\nconcerns identified.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed love working for the agency and feel very supported by their\ncoworkers and the administration. The staff interviewed reported the only thing\nthey would change is to hire more staff and make the caseload size smaller so\nthey can spend more time with the youth on their caseload. Staff feel really\nappreciated and love getting the token buttons they receive from the\nadministration leadership. Staff reported this helps with encouraging the staff and\nassist in supporting their self-worth.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe office appears to have adequate space and equipment for the staff members\nto complete their required responsibilities. Physical CHRI and case files are all\nstored securely, preventing unauthorized access. No concerns were noted.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n6/10/2024\n______________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6/10/2024\n_______________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
