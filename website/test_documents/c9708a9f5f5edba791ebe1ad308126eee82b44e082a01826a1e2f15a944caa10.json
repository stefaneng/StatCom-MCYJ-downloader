    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited\nto:\n(iii)Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or otherwise\nsuggesting physical or emotional harm to a youth.\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a\nyouth’s background or appearance or mental state. Yelling,\nthreats, ridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Type Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nAllegation Former Staff 1 referred to Youth J in a derogatory manner\nand threatened to put hands on her.\nInvestigation I contacted Complainant, also Staff 3, via phone on 5/2/23. She\ndenied witnessing the interaction between Youth J and Former\nStaff 1 but identified Staff 2 as a witness.\nI notified Rights Officer of the allegations.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing rule violations.\nI notified Foster Care Worker that I was assigned this\ninvestigation. She expressed no concerns about staff at the\nfacility.\nI interviewed Youth J with Rights Officer present on 5/4/23.\nShe said she was standing around the staff desk having a “bad\nhair day.” Former Staff 1 asked if she was going to school or\nnot and “checked” her (meaning the staff confronted her about\nsaying one thing and doing another.) We argued about it. Staff\n2 was there. Former Staff 1 told Staff 2, ‘If this mother fucker\ncomes close to me, I’m going to knock her ass out.’”\nI interviewed Youth A with Rights Officer present. Prior to\ninteracting with Youth J, she said Former Staff 1 “had an\nattitude.” She was “checking” Youth J challenging whether or\nnot she was going to school. Youth A heard Former Staff 1\nsay, “Let this little mother fucker walk up on me. I’ll beat the\nfuck out of her.”\n2",
    "I interviewed Youth P with Rights Officer present. She said\nYouth J got loud on the unit and said, “This hoe better not come\nnear me.” Youth P did not hear Former Staff 1 say anything\ninappropriate back.\nI interviewed Staff 2 with Rights Officer present. She has\nworked at the facility for seven months. Staff 2 was present\nwhen Youth J announced she would stay in her room all day\nand miss school. After that Youth J came out of her room\nasking for the blow dryer. Former Staff 1 said to Youth J, “I\nthought you weren’t going to school.” Youth J said she might\ngo and started cussing. Former Staff 1 remarked, “These kids\nare not going to keep disrespecting me.” Staff 2 denied hearing\nFormer Staff 1 cuss or threaten Youth J.\nI was unable to interview Former Staff 1 as she resigned and\nnever returned to work after this incident. Rights Officer,\nhowever, said he did speak to Former Staff 1 on the day of the\nincident, and she denied all of the allegations. Rights Officer\nadded that Youth A and J are “very close” and that he suspects\nthey may have collaborated to provide an inaccurate account of\nevents.\nAnalysis Youth J and A supported the allegations while Staff 2, Youth P\nand Former Staff 1 denied them. At this time, it cannot be\ndetermined that Former Staff 1 spoke in a derogatory manner\nor threatened to harm Youth J.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMay 18, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n3",
