    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth reported being inappropriately touched by staff. No specific details or date,\nother than October, were provided.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was reported to Centralized Intake and transferred for investigation.\nThe youth involved is over 18 years old. The allegations noted the following,\nThis was reported by the Director to Centralized Intake yesterday but not opened\nbecause the youth is 18 years old. It was reportedly sent to Adult Protective\nServices. Law enforcement was also notified by the facility. Lincoln Center youth,\nYouth A, reported that he was touched inappropriately by Staff 1. No specific\ndetails or date, other than October, were provided.\nI met with the Director at the facility on 11/24/21 and he noted that he reported the\nincident to Centralized Intake and local law enforcement on 11/23/21. The Director\nsaid that this information was not brought to his attention by staff, but when Youth A\nwas interviewed by a DHHS PREA Juvenile Compliance Analyst he reported the\nallegation, and the Analyst advised the Director. The Director said that he often talks\nto Youth A who had not mentioned this allegation. Law enforcement was already out\nto the facility and interviewed Youth A, Staff 1, and the Facility Manager on 11/23/21.\nThe Director implemented a safety plan for Staff 1 to be removed from Youth A’s\npod and reassigned so they will have no contact until the investigation is over. The\nDirector also provided documentation related to the incident.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 11/24/21. Youth A reported that he told his\nTherapist about the allegation in October and gave her a written statement. Youth A\nsaid the Therapist didn’t do anything with the statement other than process his\nconsequences because he had acted out. Youth A said he didn’t care about what\nStaff 1 did and would not report any details as to what occurred. Youth A was upset\nbecause there was an incident that occurred where he and Staff 1 were arguing over\nsome chips and Youth A said that he and Staff 1 said things they shouldn’t have but\nYouth A would not provide specific details. Youth A said three peers were present\nbut don’t know much and didn’t see much. Youth A said that his peers signed his\nwritten statement because of the consequences he received after the argument.\nI interviewed the Therapist at the facility on 11/24/21. The Therapist said that she\nwas not here during the incident with Youth A and Staff 1 when they got into the\nargument. From what the Therapist said she learned afterward, Youth A asked for\nchips but had already had some and then got escalated and began arguing with\nStaff 1. The Therapist said that it appeared both Youth A and Staff 1 said some\nthings they shouldn’t have which included Youth A threatening to bring his family up\nto assault Staff 1. The Therapist said that Youth A wrote a petition and had his group\nmembers sign it. In this written petition, Youth A stated that Staff 1 had touched him\ninappropriately but did not say when this happened. The Therapist said she asked\nYouth A, but he did not give details or say when this happened. The Therapist said\n3",
    "she took this as Youth A receiving a consequence for his behavior, so he was\nretaliating on Staff 1 and trying to get her fired. The Therapist said that she got the\nSupervisor and Staff 2 to meet with Youth A and process the situation, but they did\nnot get clarity on what Youth A was alleging occurred with Staff 1 touching him.\nWhen asked about this allegation being reported to Centralized Intake, the Therapist\nsaid that she told the Supervisor as well as an Intern working with the Clinical\nDirector and documented it in a clinical note. The Therapist said she only makes a\nreport if she is told to do so. When reminded that the Therapist is a mandated\nreporter, the Therapist appeared to know this as she understood that she would\nhave to make a report if a youth disclosed or alleged abuse by a parent. I clarified for\nthe Therapist that the requirement to report is the same and that telling a supervisor\nor other facility staff does not relieve her of her obligation to report the allegation to\nCentralized Intake.\nI interviewed Youths B, C, and D at the facility on 11/24/21. All of these youth were\nin the dining area when the altercation between Youth A and Staff 1 occurred and\nsaid they heard Youth A call Staff 1 a predator. None of these youth reported\nknowing any specifics as to what Youth A was alleging Staff 1 had done to him.\nNone of the youth reported ever seeing Staff 1 act or touch Youth A inappropriately.\nNone reported Staff 1 being inappropriate with them. The three youths said that they\nsigned Youth A’s written statement as they felt Youth A got unduly consequented\nbecause of the verbal altercation with Staff 1. The youth said Staff 1 was also\narguing with Youth A and being confrontational so they felt Youth A shouldn’t be the\nonly one getting in trouble.\nOn 11/29/21, Youth A’s placing worker emailed that she had met with Youth A, but\nhe did not provide any clarifying information related to the allegations.\nI interviewed the Facility Manager (FM) on 12/01/21. The FM said that he was on\nduty and was aware that Staff 1 and Youth A exchanged words over some chips\nbecause Youth A said he didn’t get any extra chips. The FM said he reviewed video\nand Youth A had received extra chips. The FM said that Youth A called Staff 1\nnames and called her a predator but did not say anything that Staff 1 had done and\ndid not make an actual complaint or allegation at that time. The FM said that the next\nday the Therapist and Supervisor addressed Youth A with his group. The FM said\nYouth A was trying to get his peers to back up his argument so he would not lose a\nlevel and, in that process, said that Staff 1 touches kids. Youth A had also put that\nStaff 1 touched him in the written statement, but when asked about this, Youth A did\nnot give any details. The FM said that Youth A’s goal was to get the write-up for his\nmisbehavior to disappear.\nI interviewed the Supervisor on 12/01/21, at the facility. The Supervisor said that this\nincident started in the dining hall when Youth A claimed he didn’t get extra chips, but\nhe had. Words were exchanged between Youth A and Staff 1 and Youth A got\nescalated. The Supervisor said he heard the argument from the hall and went to talk\nto Youth A. The Supervisor said that Youth A made no comments to him about Staff\n4",
    "1 touching kids. The Supervisor said that the following day, Youth A wrote a letter\nsaying that Staff 1 touched him inappropriately and gave it to the Therapist. The\nTherapist and Supervisor met with Youth A and Youth A didn’t provide any specifics\nto the allegation. The Supervisor said that there were “holes in his story.” The\nSupervisor also stated that the Therapist felt Youth A was lying about the allegation.\nWhen asked about why the Supervisor did not ensure this allegation was reported to\nCentralized Intake, he said he did not report it because the Therapist had the letter\nand he thought she had reported it. I clarified for the Supervisor that the requirement\nto report is not lifted because he thought someone else reported and also noted that\nit is his obligation to ensure allegations are reported to Centralized Intake so that\nthey may be investigated.\nOn 12/03/21, Youth A’s placing worker emailed the following after meeting with\nYouth A again,\nYouth A was vague and the writer asked for specific communication about what\nhe meant with \"touched inappropriately?\" Youth A stated that his genitals were\ntouched \"groped\" by staff that was not perceived to be an accident. Youth stated\nthat he happened more than 2 times and less than 5 times. Youth A stated that\nhe also spoke with the Police about it following our meeting last week (on\n11/23/21).\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility, on 12/09/21. Staff 1 reported that she never\ntouched Youth A or any residents inappropriately. Staff 1 said that Youth A was mad\nbecause he couldn’t go to the gym, wasn’t following directives and then got mad\nover some chips. Staff 1 said she doesn’t work with Youth A often and noted only a\nhandful of times that she’s been on his pod. Staff 1 said that during the incident\nrelated to the chips she reminded Youth A of the rules, policies, and set boundaries.\nStaff 1 denied saying anything about Youth A or his family. Staff 1 said that she is\nnow on another pod on midnight shift.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 12/09/21. Staff 2 reported that she was not here\non the day of the incident with Staff 1 and Youth A. The following day Staff 2 said\nthat Youth A was receiving a consequence for the incident and Youth A told Staff 2\nthat he called Staff 1 a predator. Staff 2 said that Youth A told her that Staff 1\ntouched him, but when Staff 2 asked Youth A when this happened, Youth A said it\nwas a “while ago” and didn’t remember exactly. Youth A gave a letter to the\nTherapist and told the Therapist about Staff 1 touching him. Staff 2 said she sat in a\nmeeting with the Therapist, Supervisor and Youth A to discuss the incident and to try\nand get more information from Youth A, but Youth A didn’t say when this happened.\nPer Staff 2, Youth A was questioned as to why he only brought this up after\nreceiving a consequence. When I asked Staff 2 about whether she reported this\nallegation, she said she was not there on the day it initially occurred and when she\ncame back, the Therapist had the letter, so Staff 2 thought the Therapist reported it. I\nclarified for Staff 2 that the requirement to report is not lifted because she thought\nsomeone else reported and also noted that it is his obligation to ensure allegations\nare reported to Centralized Intake so that they may be investigated.\n5",
    "Documentation reviewed for this investigation:\n Facility Rule Violation and Disciplinary Consequence Record for Youth A,\ndated 10/18/21, authored by Staff 1 and approved by the Supervisor.\n‘Threatening/Bullying’ noted as the rule violation and explained ‘Youth A\ndisrespected staff by threatening to beat her u, was using profanity and not\nfollowing staff directives.’ consequences included verbal apology, apology\nletter, 1 RTP assignment, 3 days loss of free time rec privileges and return to\nlevel 1 Merit Privileges for 5 days.\n Written statement from Youth A, undated. Youth A confirmed during his\ninterview this was his statement. In the statement, the letter noted, ‘Me and\nStaff 1 started arguing because I called her a predator. She touched me\nbefore in my area where I didn’t feel comfortable.’ ‘She’s a predator how lid to\ntouch kids. She touched me before here on Pod B and bought me a bag of\nchips not to say anything…’\n Written statements from the other youth. Youth D’s statement said that he has\nnot seen Staff 1 touch Youth A, but ‘I have seen other peers from another pod\nget touched inappropriately.’ Youth D did not provide any further information\non this during his interview.\n Written statement from Staff 1, dated 11/23/21. Staff 1 denied the allegation.\n Highland Park Police Department Incident No: 21-002393, dated 11/23/21.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 touched him 10 times in his genital area and always\nin Youth A’s bedroom. Youth A did not want to provide details and did not\nwant to press charges. Staff 1 denied the allegations. The Facility Manager\nreported he learned of the allegation a month prior. When the officer asked\nwhy it wasn’t reported then, the FM said that the information was in the letter\nYouth A wrote and it ‘“mostly\" contained information about Youth A's\ndiscipline and only briefly mentioned something about Staff 1 being a\npredator.’ The FM reported that it was reported now, as Youth A told the\nDHHS PREA auditor, so they needed to follow up.\n MiSACWIS Incident Report, 126780182, authored by the Director. ‘While\nbeing interviewed by PREA Consultant on Monday, November 22, 2021,\nResident, Youth A, alleged that Youth Worker, Staff 1, touched him\ninappropriately about a month ago. Until further notice, Staff 1 will not have\nany contact with Youth A until the completion of an investigation. A PREA\nInvestigation has been initiated.\n Facility policy on Privacy and Confidentiality, Duty to Report: The policy\noutlines for staff to immediately report the incident to their supervisor as well\nas to report directly to Child Protective Services.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position\nassigned.\nANALYSIS: The facility is compliant with the rule as there is no supporting\nevidence that Staff 1 touched Youth A inappropriately. Staff 1\ndenied this and none of the other youth recalled any\ninappropriate actions by Staff 1. The report by Youth A was\nvague and did not include any dates. Although he reported this\nto have occurred in his bedroom, there are no cameras in the\nbedrooms and because so much time had passed, there would\nbe no video to review.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe facility did not report the allegations of possible abuse as required.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, it was found that the facility did not report the\nallegation of abuse to Centralized Intake as required. As previously noted in the\nabove interview notes, four mandated reporters, the Therapist, the Supervisor, Staff\n2, and Facility Manager, failed to report Youth A’s allegation of Staff 1 touching him\ninappropriately to Centralized Intake. Each reported they thought someone else\nwould have reported it and did not communicate with one another to ensure it was\nreported.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4131 Compliance with child protection law; development of plan\nrequired.\nThe licensee shall develop and implement a written plan to\nassure compliance with the child protection law, 1975 PA\n238, MCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nANALYSIS: Four staff had knowledge of Youth A’s allegation that Staff 1\ntouched him inappropriately and did not report it to Centralized\nIntake. The incident was eventually reported, when Youth A\nmentioned it to a DHHS PREA analyst who told the Director.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2022C0207002 intake 10/05/21, CAP approved 12/21/21\nThe CAP for this violation must indicate that all staff,\nincluding Therapists, Supervisors, Facility Managers,\nNurses, and Administrators, etc., are retrained on the child\nprotection law and their obligation to report allegations of\nabuse. This violation is not specific to direct care staff.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This is due to the overlapping timeframe of the repeat violation, and\nthe recent approval of the previous violation CAP only eight days ago, and the\nchange in leadership that occurred in October 2021. This recommendation is\ncontingent on the facility submitting an acceptable corrective action plan for the\nnoted violation.\nDecember 29, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 29, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n8"
