CONSULTATION\nPer the MDHHS Mental Health Stabilization contract (page 46) which would include\nall of the residents in Rose Hall, individual therapy shall occur more than once a\nweek.\nFor reporting accuracy, all staff, supervisors and managers must be sure to mark\nthe correct box(es) on incident reports when documenting restraints and seclusions.\nV. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nA staff person physically retaliated against a resident after the resident hit her in the\nface and pulled out her hair extensions. That staff was terminated.\n5",
    "There were no other incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nOne staff name-called a resident (verbal abuse) and was placed on a three-day\nsuspension.\nVista Maria’s policy for timely incident report writing was violated by two newly hired\nstaff. Those staff were retrained on the incident report policy.\nOne staff used unapproved CPI techniques by restraining a resident on the floor and\nagainst a wall by herself. That staff was provided individual supervision by the Rights\nAdvisor and closely monitored by the Unit Manager for compliance with appropriate\nrestraint techniques.\nTwo staff improperly restrained a resident against a wall. Those staff were debriefed,\nand alternative interventions were discussed by the Unit Manager. The supervisor\nreviewed appropriate CPI techniques with staff at monthly meetings.\nThe following items were cited during the 2019 audit:\nR 400.4147 Dental Care\nR 400.4155 & R 400.4156 Timely Treatment Plans\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan (repeat in 2020)\nRFCAN Contract 2.10 Planned Discharge – Contact\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 10, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n6",
