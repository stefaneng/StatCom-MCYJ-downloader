Youth A recalled being upset while inside the cottage\nbecause he felt like staff were taking his stuff for no reason. He\nremembered being restrained by multiple staff, including Staff 1.\nHe felt like he was pinned to the ground. Youth A stated that his\nwrists hurt as Staff 1 was grabbing them during the restraint.\nWhile Youth A was on the ground Staff 1 elbowed him in the\nthroat twice. Youth A recalled Staff 1 hitting and choking Youth A\nduring the restraint. He could not provide any more details on\nhow this occurred.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility on 05/13/2025. He\nrecalled his involvement in the incident beginning when he\nresponded to a radio call to the cottage from Staff 2. Staff 1\nencountered Youth A inside the cottage and Youth A was in an\nescalated state. Staff 1 believed Youth A had some sort of a\nsharp object, possibly a butter knife. Staff 1 recalled Youth A\nkicking items, yelling obscenities and threatening anyone near\nthem. Youth A grabbed an empty milk crate and swung it at Staff\n1’s head. Staff 1 recalled blocking this and then attempting a\nstanding restraint of Youth A. He believed Youth A dropped his\n2",
    "weight immediately, and Staff 1 fell to the floor with Youth A. Staff\n1 stated Youth A was on the ground laying on his back and was\ncontinuing to try to hit and kick Staff 1. Staff 1 believed his weight\nwas off of Youth A. Staff 1 recalled reaching across Youth A’s\ntorso to attempt to grab both of Youth A’s arms and gain control.\nStaff 1 denied ever having any of his body or weight on Youth A’s\nneck. Staff 1 could not recall exactly who was in the room with\nhim at this point. He recalled asking for Staff 3 to come and assist\nhim in restraining Youth A. Youth A was continuously shouting\nexpletives and threatening Staff 1. Staff 1 recalled attempting to\ncommunicate back to Youth A calmly, asking him to calm down so\nthe restraint could be ended. Staff 1 was not sure when Staff 3\narrived to assist, but he believed Staff 3 was able to get the object\nout of Youth A’s hands. Staff 1 noted Staff 2 did not help in the\nrestraint at all. Staff 1 recalled Youth A slowly calming down and\nstopping the attempts to hit Staff 1, so he was able to end the\nrestraint. He believed there were other staff in the cottage at that\ntime that began to interact with Youth A but no other youth were in\nthe cottage when this occurred.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility on 05/13/2025. She\nrecalled walking up to the cottage and heard yelling as it was\noccurring. Therapist 1 recalled Youth A being alone in the cottage\nwith Staff 2. Youth A was yelling, kicking items and threatening\nanyone near him. Therapist 1 recalled Staff 2 stating he had\nalready called Staff 1 for assistance.

After Staff 1 came to the cottage, Therapist 1 recalled\nYouth A picking up a milk crate and attempting to hit Staff 1.\nTherapist 1 saw Staff 1 block this with his hand.

She\nquickly came back inside and witnessed Youth A on the floor on\nhis back with Staff 1 attempting to restrain him. She recalled\nseeing Staff 1 on the floor with Youth A, balancing himself on one\nknee and having his other leg over the top of Youth A’s waist.\nStaff 1 was attempting to hold Youth A’s arms as Youth A\nattempted to hit Staff 1. Staff 3 joined the situation and tried to\ncontrol Youth A’s legs. Therapist 1 did not see any part of Staff 1\non the neck or upper body of Youth A. Therapist 1 described\nYouth A as “inconsolable” at that point, yelling and spitting while\ndoing so. Therapist 1 recalled hearing Staff 1 state “Hey man, I\ncan’t let you go until you calm down.” Therapist 1 recalled seeing\nStaff 2 grab a towel to place under Youth A’s head. Therapist 1\nstepped out again to see if any other assistance could be had. As\n3",
    "she did she heard Youth A yell that Staff 1 was choking him and\nthat Staff 1 hit him. Therapist 1 did not see if this occurred or not.\nTherapist 1 did not go back to the cottage and did not see how the\nincident ended. She recalled speaking with Youth A after the fact\nabout the restraint. Youth A stated to her that he received\nscratches and bruises from the incident, but then stated that they\nlikely came from a previous AWOL He did not attribute any\ninjuries specifically to Staff 1. She recalled talking about the\nrestraint with Youth A and Youth A did not state Staff 1 hit or\nchoked him when it occurred.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 during an\nannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility on 05/13/2025. He\nrecalled being alone with Youth A in the cottage when the incident\nbegan. Staff 2 could not recall why Youth A was upset. Youth A\nfirst escalated physically by throwing trash cans around the\ncottage inside. Staff 2 recalled parts of the trash cans breaking off\nand hitting Staff 2. He called for assistance on the radio. Staff 1\nquickly came inside. Youth A grabbed a milk crate and swung it at\nStaff 1. Staff 1 was able to grab the milk crate away from Youth\nA, but Youth A put his hands on Staff 1. Staff 2 recalled seeing\nStaff 1 attempt to restrain Youth A by placing his hands up under\nYouth A’s armpits while facing him standing up. Youth A was\nstruggling against this and yelling at Staff 1. Staff 2 did not\nbelieve Staff 1 was saying anything at that point. Staff 2 recalled\nseeing Youth A slip and fall to the ground at this point, and Staff 1\nthen fell with him. Staff 2 did not see Staff 1 fall on top of Youth A\nor put any of his weight on Youth A. Staff 2 confirmed Youth A\nhad fallen on his back and stayed in that position for the rest of the\nincident. As Staff 1 attempted to hold back Youth A’s arms from\nstriking Staff 1, Staff 2 recalled him requesting Staff 2 to get some\ntowels to place under Youth A’s head. Staff 2 was aware of\nprevious head injuries to Youth A and knew Youth A often\nslammed his own head on the ground during escalated incidents.\nStaff 2 recalled hearing Staff 1 state “Talk to me, talk to me” to\nYouth A. Staff 2 saw Staff 3 come in and attempt to help restrain\nYouth A’s kicking legs. Youth A slowly calmed down enough for\nthe restraint to be ended. Staff 2 denied ever seeing Staff 1 hit\nYouth A or accidentally choke Youth A in any form.\nYouth B and Youth C were interviewed with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility on\n05/13/2025. They both confirmed they were outside during the\nincident and did not see what occurred.\n4",
