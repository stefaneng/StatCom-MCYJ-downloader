The repeat\ncitations and lack of CAP effectiveness is partially attributed to a nearly 100%\nturnover rate in staff and supervisors.\n10",
    "Chief Administrator Assessment – The Chief administrator demonstrated an\nawareness of the challenges maintaining adherence to agency’s previous CAP as\nwell as achieving licensing compliance and attributed this in part to the high staffing\nturnover rate. The chief administrator identified the need to retrain staff of the CAP\nand internal procedures needed to improve compliance.\nInterviews – The agency staff and supervisors interviewed did not report any\nconcerns and indicated that they feel they currently have a stable and dedicated\nteam.\nVII. DCWL Analyst Concerns\nNo safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy.
