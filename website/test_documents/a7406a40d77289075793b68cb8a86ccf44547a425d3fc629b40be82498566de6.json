It is unknown\nat this time if pool safety policies were reviewed or adhered to.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn August 4, 2021, at 11:30am I made an announced visit to the Muskegon County\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (Muskegon DHHS) office.\n2",
    "On August 4, 2021, I interviewed MDHHS Licensing worker 1 at Muskegon DHHS.\nMDHHS Licensing worker 1 stated that she became the assigned licensing worker in\nApril 2021. MDHHS Licensing worker 1 further stated that she has not met the foster\nfamily yet and has not been to the home. Her only correspondence has been over\nemail. MDHHS Licensing worker 1 stated that the next annual for the foster family is\ndue early next year.\nOn August 4, 2021, I interviewed MDHHS Licensing Supervisor at Muskegon DHHS.\nMDHHS Licensing Supervisor stated that MDHHS Licensing worker 3 completed the\nrenewal in January 2021 and at that time the pool was not operational due to being\nwintertime. MDHHS Licensing Supervisor stated that MDHHS Licensing worker 3 did\nnot mention to her having any concerns regarding supervision by the foster parents\nor the pool.\nMDHHS Licensing worker 3 was not interviewed as he is on long term leave.\nOn August 4, 2021, I interviewed MDHHS Licensing worker 2 at Muskegon DHHS.\nMDHHS Licensing worker 2 stated that she is assigned to the current special\nevaluation involving the foster family. MDHHS Licensing worker 2 stated that she is\nfamiliar with the foster family as she completed their renewal in 2019. MDHHS\nLicensing worker 2 stated that there were no concerns at that time regarding\nsupervision and there were locks on all of the doors and alarms on the doors leading\nto the back deck and pool area. Regarding the current complaint, MDHHS Licensing\nworker 2 stated that when she conducted a home visit, she observed the door locks\nand the door alarms. The alarm was activated when MDHHS Licensing worker 2\nopened the sliding door that leads to the deck and pool area. MDHHS Licensing\nworker 2 stated that she observed life jackets.\nOn August 4, 2021, I interviewed MDHHS FC worker at Muskegon DHHS. MDHHS\nFC worker stated that she has been assigned to the case since October 2019.\nMDHHS FC worker stated there were never any concerns regarding supervision or\nthe pool.\nOn August 10, 2021, I interviewed MDHHS worker 1 over the phone. MDHHS\nworker 1 was concerned that the foster parents did not have anything protecting the\npool from the rest of the backyard (such as fence) but did not have any other\nconcerns.\nI reviewed the following documents on August 3, 2021:\n Initial Foster/Adoption Home Evaluation (3130) for the licensed foster\nplacement dated July 20, 2017. The 3130 states the home had locks on all\nthe doors that lead to the pool as well as door alarms and a rescue pole.\n Foster Home Reevaluation (4004) dated January 29, 2021. The 4004 states\nall doors leading to the pool in the backyard have locks on them as well as\ndoor alarms and a rescue pole.\n3",
    " The complaint and contacts on MISACWIS for investigation involving the\nlicensed foster placement. MDHHS worker 1 and MDHHS Licensing worker 2\nviewed the home and observed that there was a wood dowel securing the\nsliding door that leads to the pool. Another door on the side of the house that\ncan access the pool area had a lock. There was a door alarm on the sliding\ndoor that went off when workers opened the door to observe the pool area.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12321 Hazardous materials and firearm storage\n(1) Federal standards for a foster family or group home\ninclude specific safety requirements for weapons, pools,\nhot tubs, and spas, as these pose a particular preventable\ndanger to children.\nANALYSIS: The agency is found in compliance as during review of\ndocumentation in licensed foster home file and interviews the\nfoster home was aware and had door locks and alarms on doors\nthat access the pool area as well as a rescue equipment.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend no changes to the status of the license of this child placing agency.\n___ _______8/13/2021__\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 19, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
