    "document is the forensic interview of Youth A and within this\ndocument, Youth A reported riding with Youth B and Youth C to\nthe apartment.

Each of the request forms used by Youth A\ndid not have the decision to approve or deny marked on the form\nand there was no supervisor signature and date on any of the\nrequest forms. These is no documentation that Youth A met with\nthe treatment team to discuss outings as required in the policy on\noutings. The documents of Youth A completing all the\nrequirements for outing are not completed and several have the\nstart date but no completion date. The policy for independent\nouting is not completed and ends after PIE 5. PIE 6 and PIE 7 are\ndocumented as being under development. There is evidence\nYouth A did not follow the outing policy when she took\ntransportation with Youth B and Youth C.\nGiven the policy and program statement that this program is\ndesigned to provide independent living skills for youth and youth\nare allowed to go on outing without direct staff supervision, there\nis no violation for a lack of supervision by staff.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe facility needs to review and update the outing policies and\nprocedures to what they are practicing and train staff on following the\nprotocol to determine if an unsupervised outing is appropriate.\nIt was recommended and discussed the facility ensure all forms are\ncompleted since several did not have the signatures and dates since\nthere was a signature line and date line on the form. The facility\nagreed that these items needed to be completed.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\n7",
    "Based on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n2/15/2024\n______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 15, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
