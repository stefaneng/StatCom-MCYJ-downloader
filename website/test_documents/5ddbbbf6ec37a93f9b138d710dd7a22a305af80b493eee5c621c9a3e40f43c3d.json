    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10171 Resident confinement room; approved\nSection usage\nDescription A facility approved to use a resident confinement room may place\na resident in this room for the following reasons:\n(b) For medical reasons.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On or around 2/17/25, a youth was placed in confinement for\nhaving a suspected STI.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on April 7, 2025. Staff 1\nreported that she heard complaints from other staff members at\nthe facility that Youth A was confined to her room during her time\nat the facility because she had a sexually transmitted infection\n(STI). She reported she was not there when Youth A was confined\nto her room but heard it from other staff as they felt Youth A was\nbeing discriminated against. Staff 1 did not want to provide the\nnames of the staff that shared these concerns. She reported there\nhave been other youth at the facility who had STIs, and they were\nnever isolated in their room. Staff 1 reported that Manager was the\none to approve of this isolation and she believes Manager did this\nbecause Youth A did not want to talk with Manager. She reported\nshe attempted to look at the documentation about this approved\nisolation and could only find it in a daily note that Youth A was on\nmedical isolation. Staff 1 reported that she felt this situation was\nnot a common protocol as there was no documentation and no\nother youth had gone on medical isolation for this before.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face via Microsoft TEAMS on\nApril 10, 2025. Youth A reported when she first arrived at the\nfacility on February 17, 2025, she had to stay in medical isolation\nuntil she was able to meet with Nurse. She reported that the\nreason she had to stay in medical isolation was because she was\npregnant and reported she was harmed by police before coming\nto the facility. Youth A reported she understood the reasoning and\nwas only there for a few hours. She reported staff were constantly\nchecking on her when she was in medical isolation which made\nher frustrated because she just wanted to be left alone. Youth A\nreported she did not like the staff at the facility because they\nwould make her frustrated with the rules. She reported the only\nstaff she liked at the facility were Nurse and Manager. Youth A\nreported she felt those were the only two people there who cared\n2",
    "about her and wanted her to make positive choices. She reported\nshe enjoyed talking to Manager as she was a therapist and could\nprocess her frustrations with her.\nNurse was interviewed face to face at the facility on April 8,\n2025. Nurse reported Youth A arrived at the facility on February\n17, 2025. She reported she was called by Manager after Youth\nA’s intake assessment due to reported concerns. Nurse reported\nwhen Youth A was completing her intake, she reported she was\npregnant, thrown down by police, and had three sexually\ntransmitted infections (STI). She reported receiving this\ninformation from Manager. Nurse reported she investigated Youth\nA’s medical history and found that Youth A was prescribed\nantibiotics in December 2024 for her STIs but never picked up the\nprescriptions. Nurse reported due to Youth A having confirmed\nSTIs and not being on medications she called Manager and\nrequested Youth A to be put in medical isolation until she can get\nthe antibiotics. She reported she went to pick up Youth A’s\nantibiotics on the same day of her arrival and then completed her\nmedical assessment of Youth A. Nurse reported Youth A was only\nplaced in medical isolation for a couple of hours and went into the\ngeneral population again the next morning. She reported Youth A\nwent into isolation because it was confirmed that she could be\nspreading a disease and wanted to make sure she started\nmedication before going into the general population.\nManager was interviewed face to face at the facility on April\n15, 2025. Manager reported she is the clinical manager for the\nfacility and recently came into this role. She reported within her\nrole she receives the notification when a youth is about to be\nlodged at their facility and tries to review their history before being\nplaced. Manager reported she received notification that Youth A\nwas going to be picked up by police on February 17, 2025, at\n1:22pm. She confirmed the email report from the court of Youth\nA’s pick-up court order to this consultant. She reported she began\nto review Youth A’s historical file to see what needs Youth A may\nhave. Manager reported she saw a note from December 11, 2024,\nwhich noted, “We have a medical situation with Youth A right now\nthat could be life-threatening. She needs this medication.” The\nnext note from January 2, 2025, noted, Youth A continued to\nremain AWOL since December 8, 2024, and stated “there is\nongoing concern that Youth A is without her antibiotic or\nmedication. She has a kidney infection from untreated STIs that\nshe is supposed to be on medication for.” Manager showed both\nthese notes to this consultant. She reported after she reviewed\npast notes she sent out an email to Supervisor 2 and Nurse about\n3",
    "the intake of Youth A coming to the facility with the noted\nconcerns of Youth A needing antibiotic medications. The email\nwas reviewed which was dated February 17, 2025, at 1:34pm.\nThe email chain did show confirmation of Supervisor 2 responding\nand looking into Youth A’s medication needs and talking with\nNurse. She reported Youth A was brought to the facility around\n2:00 pm and began to do the intake process with Supervisor 2.\nManager reported she attempted to call Nurse via phone at\n2:47pm which Nurse sent her a text message back. She reported\nshe talked with Nurse about the concerns of Youth A’s untreated\nmedical concerns and pregnancy. Manager reported Nurse\nrequested for Youth A to go into medical isolation until she could\ncome see her at the detention center which was around 6:45pm\nthat evening. She showed this consultant these text messages\nwhich verified the time was correct from her interview. Manager\nreported while she was on her way to the facility to meet with\nYouth A, she attempted to stop by Walgreens to pick up Youth A’s\nmedication but was unable to do so due to needing a new doctor's\nauthorization. She reported rather than waiting for the medications\nshe went to the facility so Nurse could pick up the medications on\nher way in. Manager reported she could not remember exactly\nwhen she arrived to the facility but when she was there, Youth A\nhad already been processed by Supervisor 2 and was in the gym\nwith the other peers. She reported she requested Supervisor 2 to\nget Youth A out of the gym and be brought to the medical area so\nthat Youth A could talk with Manager and wait for Nurse to get\nthere. She reported this was around 3:00pm and Youth A came up\naround 3:30pm. Manager reported she was able to speak with\nYouth A who reported when she was getting picked up by police,\nan officer restrained her and threw her to the ground. Youth A was\nconcerned about this because she was pregnant and was worried\nher baby was harmed. Youth A began to get irritable within the\nmedical isolation room because she did not want to be locked up\nin detention and was having a difficult time processing her trauma.\nManager reported she stepped out of the room around 5:00pm\nwhich is when Youth A went into official medical isolation until\nNurse arrived at 6:44pm. After the medical exam, Youth A went\nback to her room for the rest of the night for bed. Manager did\nshow this consultant the documentation on the computer of the\n15-minute checks being completed at 5:00pm until Nurse arrived\nand completed her assessment. Manager reported she followed\nthrough with the request of Nurse for medical isolation due to\nuntreated STI concerns and concerns about the assault by police\nwith being pregnant. She reported there have been youth in the\npast that have been admitted with an STI that did not need\n4",
    "medical isolation but that was because they were on antibiotics\nalready and were previously medically cleared.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nApril 8, 2025. Supervisor 1 reported Manager and Nurse have\npermission to put a youth into medical isolation. He reported he\nwas not present when Youth A was admitted into the facility on\nFebruary 17, 2025. Supervisor 1 reported medical isolation is\ntreated like disciplinary confinement where written approval and\nchecks need to be completed every fifteen minutes. He reported\nStaff 2 and Supervisor 2 were working with Youth A when she was\nadmitted into the facility and then went into medical isolation.\nSupervisor 1 reported staff at the facility have been upset with\nrecent changes at the facility as there has been a new\nadministration team coming in such as Manager and Nurse. He\nwent through Youth A’s file with this consultant which showed the\nnote from Manager on February 17, 2025, showing Nurse\nrequesting medical isolation. Supervisor 1 showed this consultant\nthe documentation of the fifteen-minute checks that were\ncompleted in the system and were completed appropriately.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via phone on April 24,2025.\nSupervisor 2 reported she was involved in the intake process of\nYouth A coming into the facility on February 17,2025. She\nreported when Youth A was processed, she was released into the\ngeneral population.
