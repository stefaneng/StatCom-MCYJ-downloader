    "The Chief Administrator, Foster Care Program Supervisor\nand Staff 1 were interviewed jointly via telephone on 05/17/24.\nThe Chief Administrator reported she knew of the medication\nissue and thought it was the responsibility of Wolverine Center to\ntransfer Youth A’s medication to JDC. When the Chief\nAdministrator obtained knowledge on 03/07/24 that the\nmedications had not been transferred to JDC she gave a directive\nto the Foster Care Program Supervisor that the agency needed to\nget the medications to JDC.\nThe Foster Care Program Supervisor reported the agency did not\nknow Youth A’s medications had not been transferred to JDC until\n03/07/24 when another DHHS Worker. notified the agency that\nYouth A had been without his medications. The Foster Care\nSupervisor reported she had assumed Wolverine Center had\ntransferred Youth A’s medications to JDC when he entered the\nfacility on 02/25/24.\nStaff 1 reiterated information she had given during the 03/27/24\ninterview, specifically that on 03/07/24, when it was learned that\nYouth A had not received his medication, she contacted the JDC\nDirector who initially refused to accept medications from\nWolverine Center but relented and allowed this to occur.\nYouth A was interviewed on 03/07/24 during investigation\n2024SIC0001225. A review of this related investigation indicates\nYouth A was interviewed by Consultant 3. Youth A reported at that\ntime he had not received his medications.\nOn 05/07/24, the DCWL Licensing Consultant 1 for JDC, emailed\nmedical information for Youth A per my request.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\n• A document titled, “Wayne County Juvenile Detention\nFacility Special Services Consult Form”, documents that\nJDC received from a Wolverine Center staff, Youth A’s\nmedication on 03/14/24.\n• Youth A’s case file: The file documents that Youth A was\ndischarged from Wolverine Center on 02/25/24 and entered\nJDC on the same date.\n• There is not a documented social work contact indicating\nStaff 1 had spoken with the JDC Director.\n• A review of an Updated Service Plan dated 03/14/24\ndocuments that Youth A was prescribed three medications\nwith a start date of 02/15/24.\n3",
