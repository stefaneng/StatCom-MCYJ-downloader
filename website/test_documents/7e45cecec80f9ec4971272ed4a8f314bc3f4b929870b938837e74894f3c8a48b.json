The struggle ends quickly and Staff\n1 is observed to go up the stairs.\nAgency Incident Reports:\n5",
    "An incident report dated March 2023, and written by Staff 1 was\nreviewed. The report documents the following information. Staff 1\nhad walked back into the house and made the statement to the\nyouth, “So what y’all supposed to be jumping me?” Staff 1\ninstructed all youth to go upstairs but they refused. Staff 1 noticed\nthe smell of marijuana and wanted to do an upstairs room search.\nAs Staff 1 was trying to go upstairs Youth A was blocking his path.\nStaff 1 tried to walk around Youth A and Youth A pushed him\ndown the stairs.

When Staff 1 arrived at the home per the\ninstruction of the Program Manager he shortly received a call from\nthe Chief Administrator and took the call outside. Youth C opened\nthe door and Staff 1 instructs Youth C to close the door. Youth C\nrefused, then Staff 1 slammed the door shut, and subsequently\nYouth C yelled to the other youth that Staff 1 had slammed the\ndoor shut on his head.\nAn incident report dated March 20, 2023, written by Staff 2,\nspeaks to the unknown female found in a youths bedroom and her\ninstruction for the unknown female to leave the home and the\nsubsequent threats the unknown female made towards her. The\nreport does not offer any additional information which has not\nbeen addressed in this investigation.

A third report written by\nStaff 2 on March 20, 2023, documents that Youth A was making\nthreats about attacking Staff 1 should he arrive to the home as\nStaff 2 informed Youth A she was calling Staff 1.\nPolice Report.\nA police report dated March 20, 2023, was reviewed.

    "Analysis Staff 1 and 2 demonstrated an inability to perform their duties as\nrequired by this rule. Program youth were escalated from earlier\nencounters with Staff 1, Staff 2, and the police regarding the\nunknown female and her encounter with Staff 2, as well as the\nallegation that people arrived to the home with weapons. The\nProgram Manager also reported that she heard over the phone\nthat youth were defiant and trying to fight Staff 1. When Staff 1\nwas on the stairwell and was pushed by Youth A, Staff 1 then\nattempted to go up the stairs a second time and was pushed\nagain by Youth A, they struggled and fell. The police report\ndocumented that Staff 1 had told police he tried to force his way\nup the stairs. Staff 1 should have retreated until escalated youth\nhad become regulated and calmed down.\nStaff 1’s incident report documents that he said to youth, “So what\ny’all supposed to be jumping me”, a statement that does conform\nto known and practiced de-escalation techniques.\nYouth A and Youth B reported that Staff 2 had called people\nknown to her and these people arrived to the home and had\nweapons. Staff 2 denied that people with weapons had arrived to\nsupport her and that only her cousin arrived and she sat in her car\nacross the street. Staff 2 should not have called for support other\nthan agency staff/supervisors and the police.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJune 8, 2023\n______________________________________\nDouglas W Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n7",
