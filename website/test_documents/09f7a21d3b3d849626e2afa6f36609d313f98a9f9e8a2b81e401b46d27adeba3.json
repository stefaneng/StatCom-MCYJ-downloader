TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not offered technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during\nthis licensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nOne CAP was in response to the 2020 Renewal Inspection findings.\nThe second was in response to Special Investigation 2021C0217009 where a\ncomplaint was received stating the agency did not notify the court of the children’s\nfoster care worker changes and placement change; the agency failed to obtain a\ncourt-ordered trauma assessment for the child; and the agency failed to file a\npetition to terminate parental rights for the children. The agency was found in non-\ncompliance for R 400.12405 Change of Placement and R 400.12202 Policy and\nprocedures as the agency did not complete the DHS-69 forms timely after the foster\ncare worker changes and placement change; the agency did not complete a timely\ntrauma assessment referral for the child due to a new foster care worker being\nassigned to the case and the foster care supervisor did not review the case in\nmonthly supervision or review the orders of the case as required; and the\ntermination of parental rights petition for the children was not completed timely. The\nagency developed a corrective action plan that was appropriate and implemented as\nverified with a random review of case files during this audit.\nThe staff and supervisors interviewed reported no concerns with the program. They\nindicated that they have been working together as a team to manage the challenges\nthat the pandemic has caused such as staff turnover. They reported they are\ncommitted to provide services to the children and families to assist in achieving\npermanency for the children.\n15",
