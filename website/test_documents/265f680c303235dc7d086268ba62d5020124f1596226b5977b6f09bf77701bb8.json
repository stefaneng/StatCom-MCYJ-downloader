She\nstated she arrived at the location of the incident after Youth A and\nYouth E had fought each other. Both of the youth were continuing\nto yell and threaten each other at this point.

Supervisor 1 stated he\ndid see Staff 1 holding Youth A by his hands behind Youth A’s\nback in an attempt to hold him back from attacking Youth E further\nas well as escorting him down the hallway. Supervisor 1 also\nstated he saw Youth A up against a wall at one point, but pointed\nout that he believed it was Youth A’s momentum that took both\nYouth A and Staff 1 to the wall, and Youth A was not pressed up\nagainst the wall in a manner that would possibly injure him.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 08/09/2024.

Staff 1 stated Youth A\n4",
    "was still significantly escalated as this occurred. Staff 1 attempted\nto escort Youth A down the hallway and there was more than one\npoint where Youth A and he bumped up against the walls of the\nhallway. Staff 1 stated this was not intentional and was more\ncaused by Youth A’s escalation and difficulty in holding him back\nthan anything else. Staff 1 stated Youth A was never slammed\nagainst a wall, and he never had any concern over Youth A’s\nability to breath or receiving injuries. He stated he knew this\nbecause Youth A never commented on about struggling to breath\nor being hurt.\nNurse 1 was interviewed over the phone on 08/16/2024. She\nstated she assessed Youth A after the incident occurred, but she\ndid not witness the incident itself. Nurse 1 recalled Youth A\nstating to her he started a fight in an effort to try to break out of the\nfacility. Youth A would not comment to her which staff restrained\nhim. Nurse 1 recalled Youth A had only injuries of superficial\nscratches on his forehead. Youth A commented that he might\nhave caused them himself, but they also might’ve been caused by\nthe incident. Nurse 1 also commented that Youth A’s story of the\nincident changed as he spoke to her about the incident,\nspecifically in how many times he felt he was “slammed” against\nthe wall during the incident and in how he received the superficial\nscratches on his forehead.\nVideo reviewed:\n• Security footage for the 06/17/2024 incident was provided\nand reviewed. The footage captured the hallway where the\nincident occurred. Youth A and Youth E were seen\nfighting, and staff came to attempt to break up the fight.\nWithin a minute Youth A was separated from Youth E by\nStaff 1 and escorted down the hallway. The footage then\nflipped to the other end of the hallway heading to the door\nof the unit. Staff 1 was holding Youth A’s arms from behind\nas they both walked towards the doorway. Youth A was\nseen struggling against the restraint, and at one point he\nstepped toward a wall. Youth A’s head and face never\nappeared to touch the wall, only his chest.

Youth A continued to struggle and in doing so\nthey both turned towards the opposite wall and slammed\ninto it. Youth A continued to struggle against the hold of\nStaff 1 while they both were able to move through the\n5",
    "doorway at the end of the hallway. As that occurred Youth\nE was seen rushing towards them and was stopped by\nstaff. Youth E then walked back the other way.
