The violations\nwere noted for employee personnel files, tuberculosis screenings for\nemployees, staff to resident ratio for varying interval room checks\nexceeding fifteen minutes and staff training. The CAP contained action\nitems to ensure documents required for employee files were obtained\nprior to hire by utilizing a checklist to confirm all required documents\nwere obtained. Per the current audit findings, there are repeat rule\nviolations for new employee files continuing to lack job descriptions,\neducation verification, and tuberculosis screening. The facility\nimplemented a system for human resources to email prompt sheet\nreminders to supervisors a month prior to evaluations being completed\nwithin the required timeframe. The facility reviewed expectations of\nvarying interval checks not to exceed fifteen minutes with all staff,\nimplemented supervisors review room check logs to ensure compliance\nwas being met. The facility ensured all staff were provided orientation\ntraining for the specific facility as well as incorporated orientation for both\nfacilities into their new staff orientation.\n• SIR2024C0001084, CAP approved 2/13/2024 was a result of violation\nfor Rule 400.4109 (1) (c) due to the facility not following their internal\npolicy and procedure for supervising youth as well as supervising youth\nwhile on technology.

The\nfacilities financial audit and budget were reviewed during inspection.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)",
    "N/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed. Chief Administrator reported\nfindings in Interim inspection had a positive impact as the CAP assisted in\nensuring compliance for this Renewal inspection as the CAP provided a proactive\nplan to review all documentation in order to obtain any missing or late submission\nof documents. The facility has found the prompt sheets a useful tool to ensure\nevaluations and treatment plans are coming due to ensure completion.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviews were conducted during the inspection. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by upper management, having all the required trainings to be successful\nin their position, and no immediate concerns. Per interviews, the facility is\nexperiencing low staffing and is working to obtain more staff in order to elevate on\ncall supervisors having to fill shifts.\nYouth interviews were conducted during the inspection. Youth reported feeling\nsafe and supported by staff at the facility. Youth reported all their needs are met at\nthe facility and no concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility was completed during the onsite inspection and no\nsafety concerns were noted.
