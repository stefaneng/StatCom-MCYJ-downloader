The child\nrode her bicycle outside of the subdivision to a busy main road. The foster child was\nalone and unsupervised. The foster parent was unaware of the foster child’s\nlocation. The police was called out and the foster child was returned back to the\nfoster home. Once the foster child was returned back to the foster home there was\na lot of yelling between the foster parent and the child. It is unknown what was said.\nThe agency found the foster parent in non-compliance with R 9201 Foster parent\nqualifications, R 9205 Records check, R 9403 foster parent duties. The agency\nrecommended revocation due to the foster parent stating she was unaware that she\nhad to have constant supervision on a 5- year old child and that the foster parent\nshowed that she was not able to provide the appropriate care, protection and\nsupervision of any child placed in her home. The agency handling of the special\nevaluations appears appropriate.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe agency submitted a corrective action plan for the 07/18/2018 interim inspection\nreport.

DCWL ANALYST CONCERNS ADDRESSED:\nSafety Alert #1:\nConcern: The agency does not provide all known information when requesting\nplacement.\n10",
    "The agency does not respect the parameters of the foster license. The\nfoster parents have been asked to take a child outside of their age range.\nResolution: The agency reported in emergency situations where placement is needed\nand not secured, staff do contact homes on the list to see if they would\nbe willing to change their licensing parameters and accept placement.\nHowever, placement would not occur until the parameters were changed\nthrough DCWL to ensure they are compliant prior to placement.\nThe agency responded that at times of a proposed placement, licensing is\nonly able to provide information given to them from CPS/FC. Thus,\ninformation found after placement may not always be provided to licensing\nat the time of placement.\nSafety Alert #2:\nConcern: The foster care worker was not making monthly home visits to the home.\nThe foster care worker does not make unannounced visits to the home.\nResolution: The agency response was that face to face visitations in the relative\ncaregiver home occurred on the following dates completed by the foster\ncare specialist. The visits occurred from July 13, 2017 until February 5,\n2019 announced and unannounced. They were all documented in the case\nservice plans.\nHome visits occurred in the parental home from 3/1/19 to 3/25/19 as the\nchildren was returned to the parental home. The judge ordered\ntermination of DHHS care and supervision effective 3/21/2019.\nThe agency responded in reviewing the visitation dates and looking for\ntrends some visits occurred at the end of one month and the beginning\nof the following month.\nSafety Alert #3:\nConcern: The foster parent is using a drop side crib for one of the toddlers placed\nin the home.\nResolution: Both children in the home are over the age of 2. Due to the age of the\nchildren, the family converted the non-compliant crib into a toddler bed.\nPicture is attached.\n11",
    "Safety Alert #4:\nConcern: No safety concerns was reported for this home.\nResolution: No resolution required.\nSafety Alert #5:\nConcern: No safety concerns was reported for this home.\nResolution: No resolution required.\nSafety Alert #6:\nConcern: The foster care worker does not make unannounced visits to the home.\nThe relative did not sign the treatment plan for the child placed in the home.\nResolution: The agency response was that prior worker did not complete any\nunannounced home visits. Since the case has been transferred to a\nnew worker an unannounced home visit occurred on 2/27/2019 and will\noccur from this point forward.\nPrior to the worker transfer there were no PATP’s signed by the caregiver.\nSince the case transferred PATP’s have been provided to caregiver and\nwill be provided from this point forward.\nIt should be noted that the agency was in violation during this renewal\nperiod for unannounced visits and the signing of PATP’s.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n12",
