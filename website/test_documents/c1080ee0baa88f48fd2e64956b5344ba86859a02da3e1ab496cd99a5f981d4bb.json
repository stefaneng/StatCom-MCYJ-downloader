    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for\nthe continual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 7/2/23, three youth went AWOL while with staff. Staff tried to\nget them back on property, but all refused so staff had to contact\npolice. While they were AWOL Youth A asked Youth B and C to\ntouch Youth A’s penis. Youth C touched it and later cried about it.\nYouth A also showed penis to youth B and C. This occurred near\na tree on the group home property. Youth A has been doing this\nsince youth A started living at the facility.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on\n07/06/2023.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator on 07/07/2023. CA confirmed\nthat Youth A, B, and C AWOLed on 07/02/2023. She reported\nthere was four staff and six youths. She said Youth B and C were\nthreatening to AWOL and staff attempted to redirect but were not\nsuccessful. The three Youths AWOLed, Staff 1 followed them, and\nthe police were contacted.

Youth A’S paperwork was approved on 07/05/2023 and he\nwas transferred to the Ohio facility. CA said there was one prior\nincident involving Youth A and another youth that was investigated\nunder SI 2023C0000538.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 07/07/2023. Youth B is 13\nyears old and has been at the facility for 18 months. She reported\nshe and Youth C were planning on AWOLing on 07/02/2023, and\nYouth A followed them. She said there were four staff supervising\nand Staff 1 followed them when they ran out of the facility. Staff 1\ntried to convince them not to AWOL, but they ran behind the\nhouse and to the woodsy area behind the house. Youth B said\nthey were standing behind a large tree and Youth A pulled his\npants and made her and Youth C touch his penis. She said it was\nvery fast because they heard Staff and the police coming towards\nthem. Youth B said this was the only time something like this\n2",
    "happened with Youth A. She said Youth A has been moved to\nanother facility.\nI interviewed Youth C at the facility on 07/07/2023.

She said when they lost sight of Staff 1 Youth A\nasked them to touch his penis. Youth A pulled his pants down and\nmade her and Youth B touch him. She said they heard Staff 1, so\nthey started to run again and hid in the tall grass. The police came\nand found them hiding. Youth C denied any previous incidents\ninvolving Youth A.\nI interviewed Youth A at the Ohio facility on 07/07/2023. Youth A\nis 15 years old and has been at the current location for two days.\nYouth A admitted that he AWOLed with Youth B and C on\n07/02/2023. He said there were four staff supervising. Staff 1\nfollowed them, but he and Youth B and C ran to the area behind\nthe house and hid behind the tall grass. He denied asking Youth B\nand C to touch his penis. Youth A said they hid in the tall grass\nuntil the police found them. He again denied Youth B and C\ntouched his private area.\nI interviewed Complainant/Therapist on 07/20/23 via telephone.\nShe reported Youth B disclosed during group therapy that when\nshe and Youth C AWOLed Youth A made them touch his penis.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Worker 1 on 07/20/23.

He said the three youths ran out of the back door\nand went into the woodsy area behind the house. He followed\nthem, but lost sight after a few minutes. He continued to look for\nthem while waiting for the police. He said they were out of sight for\napproximately 10 minutes.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 07/26/2023 via telephone. She reported on\n07/02/2023 there were four staff and 6 youths. She was dealing\n3",
    "with another youth when Youth A, B, and C AWOLed. She said\nStaff 1 followed the three youths and the police were immediately\ncontacted. She said there were not prior sexual incidents involving\nYouth A, B and C. When the Youths returned, they did not report\nany concerns.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 08/10/2023 via telephone. Staff 3 is a\ndirect care worker and has been working at the facility for one\nyear. She confirmed she was working on 07/02/2023. She\nreported Youth A, B and C left the facility and Staff 1 followed\nthem. The police were called and responded immediately. The\nthree youths were found in the area behind the facility. She said\nthere were three other staff on-site and there were six youths. She\nsaid the youths did not report any concerns when they came back\nto the facility.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Policy for Staff Requirements and Supervision dated\n11/10/21: a staffing ratio of one staff to two clients during\nawake hours and two awake staff to ten clients during\novernight hours in Michigan treatment facilities.\n• Incident Report dated 07/21/23 at 7:45 pm, written by Staff\n3. Youth A, B, and C walked off the property. Police were\nnotified, Staff 1 followed youths and with the assistance of\npolice located the three youths and returned to facility at 8\npm.\n• Youth A’s initial service plan dated 05/24/23. The report\nnotes no concerns of sexualized behavior. Supervision-\nwhile in the general areas of the home and bedroom staff\nwill provide visual supervision to ensure safety.\n• Youth A’s Safety Plan dated 06/12/2023- Due to allegations\nof inappropriate touching made by Youth A, he is to remain\n10 feet away and must be closely monitored. This was\ninvestigated under SI 2023C0000538.\n4",
    "Analysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is insufficient\nevidence that staff were not supervising or were aware of\ninappropriate touching by Youth A. There was sufficient staff on\nshift when the three youths AWOLed. The facility took appropriate\nactions, called the police, and Youth A has been moved to another\nfacility.\nCONSULTATION\nAdrian Group Home accepts male and females ages 6 – 17 and\nhas one living space for ten youth. The mix of males and females\ncombined with the wide age range for one living space has\npotential to be problematic. For supervision and programming\npurposes, it is recommended they narrow the range and/or\nconsider only accepting males or females.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth C missed five therapy sessions in May and June.\nInvestigation I interviewed FCW 1 on 07/20/2023. FCW 1 reported Youth C\nmissed several therapy sessions in the month of May and June.\nThe youth go off site for therapy. The CA told her the reason\nYouth C missed therapy was because she was on restrictions and\nanother time CA said they did not have staff to transport the Youth\nto therapy. FCW expressed concerns about the staff not\nanswering the main number when attempting to contact the facility\nand there is no answering machine or voicemail set up to leave\nmessages. FCW 1 also expressed concerns regarding incident\nreporting, because staff will tell her that Youth C is on restrictions\nfor behavioral issues, but she is not notified of these incidents.\nI interviewed Therapist on 07/20/2023 and Therapist confirmed\nYouth C missed 5 therapy session in May and June. The reasons\nprovided to her for missed session were transportation issues,\nlack of staff and disciplinary measures when youth was found to\nhave a vape pen.\n5",
