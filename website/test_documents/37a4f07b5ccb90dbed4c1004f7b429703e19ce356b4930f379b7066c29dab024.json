    "Administrator 1 also reported that, per the established safety plan, Supervisor 1 has\nbeen suspended pending investigation.\nVideo Footage-\nOn 1/7/2021 I received and reviewed video footage of the 1/5/2021 incident. Youth A\nruns down a hallway toward Youth B. Supervisor 1 is standing between the two and\nmoves his body against a wall, which prevents Youth A from reaching Youth B.\nYouth B walked up close behind Supervisor 1 at the time Supervisor 1 moves toward\nthe wall and Youth B’s arm gets pinned between the wall and Supervisor 1’s body\nfor a few seconds. Afterward, Youth A can be heard screaming that Supervisor 1\nintentionally hurt his arm. A second video clip was reviewed during which Supervisor\n1, Staff 3, and Youth B are in the hallway discussing the incident. While it is difficult\nto discern all of what is being said, Supervisor 1 can be heard laughing in response\nto Youth B, and becoming verbally escalated along with Youth B. During this\ninteraction, Youth B escalated to the point of an asthma attack. After Youth B is\nadministered his inhaler by Staff 3, he is heard crying followed by Supervisor 1\nasking Youth B, “are you going to cry about it, or do you want to go to your room”\nafter which Youth B continues to escalate and Supervisor 1 follows him out of\ncamera view and yells the question “do you want to go to your room” repeatedly.\nOn 1/7/2021 I made an unannounced visit to the facility along with DHHS Worker 1\nat which time we interviewed Youth B who reported that he “just got in the way”\nwhen Supervisor moved to block Youth A who was running toward him. Youth B\nstated that his arm was pinned by accident and that he did not have any pain or\ninjury from the incident. He reported no concerns with any of the staff in the home.\nOn 1/14/2021 I interviewed Supervisor 1 in person, along with DHHS Worker 1.\nSupervisor 1 reported that, on 1/4/2021 he was coming off of a 14-hour shift and had\nbeen working a lot of hours in general. He reported that he and Staff 2 were called to\nprovide back-up to Staff 3 & 4 because Youth A & B were fighting. Supervisor 1 and\nStaff 2 were across campus from the home in which Youth A & B are placed, so he\nran to the home. He stated that he can’t recall the specifics related to the allegation\nmade by Youth B, but he does recall Youth A saying that he might have hurt his arm.\nHe did recall “body blocking” Youth A from getting to Youth B, which he stated is\ntrained to staff during CPI training as a method of keeping a youth from a “target.”\nHe reported that body blocking can be used as long as staff don’t restrict youth’s\narms.\nSupervisor 1 reported that he was escalated throughout is interaction with Youth B\nand regrets his behavior/choices on that day. He recognized that the way he spoke\nwith Youth B further escalated the youth. Supervisor 1 stated that he was frustrated\nduring the incident and that, when he is frustrated, he is not effective.\nOn 2/1/2021, Administrator 1 called me to report that she spoke with the CPI trainer\nregarding Supervisor 1’s report that “body blocking” is taught to staff. Administrator 1\nstated that the CPI trainer did state that he uses the term body block when teaching\n611 W. OTTAWA  P.O. BOX 30664  LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/lara  517-335-1980",
    "staff to use body placement to keep a youth safe. Administrator 1 stated that the\ntrainer will no longer use this terminology as it is not a CPI approved intervention\nand staff members seem to have adopted the language. Administrator 1 also\nreported that Supervisor 1 has been demoted to a direct care staff position and is\nunder a performance improvement plan.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand procedures that describe the institution’s behavior\nmanagement system.

The concern is related to Supervisor\n1 reporting that this is a CPI method; however, a body block\ndoes not involve any type of CPI hold.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nAs noted in the above investigation, Staff 1 was heard verbally escalating Youth B\nduring their interaction and admitted that he was frustrated and inappropriate in what\nhe said to the youth.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(c) Verbal abuse, ridicule, or humiliation.\n611 W.
