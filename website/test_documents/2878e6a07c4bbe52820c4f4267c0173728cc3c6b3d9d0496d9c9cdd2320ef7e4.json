INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A youth received news that put them in an emotional state. The\nyouth has asthma and began to cough and breathe heavy. The\nyouth was unconscious for 17 minutes. Staff checked on the\nyouth's vitals and the youth's oxygen levels were low. There was\nno medical treatment provided. When the youth woke, they were\nsent back to their room. The youth had arm and chest pain.\nAdministration felt the youth was faking the incident.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 7/7/25 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported he worked the 2pm-10pm\nshift on 6/26/25. Staff 1 reported Youth A had been taken to the\nhospital earlier in the day for chest x-rays due to having a bad\ncough, but they were still waiting for the results. Staff 1 reported\naround 8pm, Youth A had an asthma attack, therefore Staff 1 and\nSupervisor were going to give him a nebulizer treatment. Staff 1\nreported Youth A received news from Youth B that had a large\nemotional effect on him while he was dealing with his asthma\nattack. Staff 1 reported Youth A stayed emotionally distraught for\napproximately 30 minutes (until 8:30pm). Staff 1 reported Youth A\nhad halfway gathered himself as his coughing subsided and his\nemotions were a little more in check. Staff 1 reported they took\nYouth A to the main room to start the nebulizer treatment. Staff 1\nreported approximately halfway away from Youth A’s room, Youth\nA said he felt light on his feet, so Staff 1 obtained a chair for him to\nsit on. Youth A was hunched over in the chair, and then passed\nout, and hit the floor face-first. Staff 1 reported he wasn’t able to\ncatch Youth A as he was falling, but as soon as he fell, Staff 1\nhelped him roll onto his back onto the floor. Staff 1 reported he\nchecked Youth A’s breathing, took his pulse, and put him onto his\nside in a cradle position when he wasn’t waking up. Staff 1\nreported he took a log of Youth A’s pulse. Staff 1 reported at first\nYouth A’s pulse was shallow, and somewhere around the 15-\nminute mark after passing out, Youth A’s heartbeat became\nirregular. Staff 1 reported he asked Supervisor for an ambulance\nto be called, and asked how far out they were, but Supervisor kept\nskirting the question and nodding his head. Staff 1 reported it\nwasn’t clear what Supervisor was doing. Staff 1 reported Youth A\n2",
    "woke up approximately 17 minutes after passing out. Staff 1\nreported once Youth A was awake, Staff 1 asked for a pulse-ox\nmachine and Supervisor obtained it for him around the 20-25\nminute range after the incident began. Staff 1 reported Youth A’s\npulse-ox was 93 and 88 is considered critical. Staff 1 reported he\ntook Youth A’s blood pressure as well, which was normal. Staff 1\nreported when Youth A initially woke up, he was very confused,\nand it took a couple minutes of Staff 1 talking to Youth A before\nYouth A acknowledged him. Staff 1 reported Youth A struggled to\ncount to 10 at first, but was able to after a couple of tries. Staff 1\nreported Youth A said he had pain in his chest and arm. Staff 1\nreported he told Supervisor Youth A had signs of a serious cardiac\nevent. Staff 1 reported Youth A drank half a cup of water and sat\nthere for approximately 30 more minutes, until he seemed okay to\nget up. Staff 1 reported Supervisor showed him a series of text\nmessages showing a decision was made not to call an\nambulance, against Staff 1’s wishes, and Youth A was sent to\nbed. Staff 1 reported he does not know who was included in the\ngroup text message conversation. Staff 1 reported Supervisor took\nover after that as Staff 1 left since his shift was over at 10pm. Staff\n1 reported Youth A never requested to go to the hospital but\nasked if anyone called his dad and asked if his dad would meet\nhim at the hospital. Staff 1 reported he checked on Youth A the\nfollowing morning, and Youth A didn’t look great. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A said his teeth and mouth hurt, which he received Orajel\nfor. Staff 1 reported around 11:30am-12pm, Youth A began\nlooking like himself again. Staff 1 reported around 2pm, Team\nLeader 2 talked to him about the situation and told him many\nyouth have faked things like this and alluded that Youth A was\nfaking things for attention, and stated they typically use smelling\nsalts to wake youth up. Staff 1 reported Supervisor never came\nover to Youth A with smelling salts or used smelling salts. When\nasked about his medical training for the assessments he made,\nStaff 1 reported he previously had CPR and First Aid training, and\ndoctors previously taught him how to take his own pulse, so he\nknew how to take Youth A’s.\nYouth A was interviewed via phone on 7/7/25 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported on 6/26/25, he received\ninformation his pregnant girlfriend was removed from her\ngrandmother’s care. Youth A reported he became upset and cried\nfor approximately 30 minutes. Youth A reported he then left his\nroom to do a breathing (nebulizer) treatment. Youth A reported to\na staff (couldn’t remember who) and Supervisor he felt\nlightheaded and couldn’t walk anymore and they gave him a chair\nto sit in. Youth A reported he had begun crying again and then he\n3",
    "started zoning out. Youth A reported he felt his eyesight was\nturning black, and then he passed out. Youth A reported he didn’t\nhear anything after he passed out. Youth A reported he didn’t feel\nanyone tapping him or trying to wake him up after he passed out.\nYouth A reported after he woke up, staff (couldn’t remember who)\nand Supervisor took his pulse and checked his lungs. Youth A\nreported at first, he thought he was going to the hospital because\nthe staff (couldn’t remember who) said he was, but they decided\nnot to take him to the hospital. Youth A reported he completed his\nbreathing treatment. Youth A reported he then went to his room,\nand staff were watching him. Youth A reported the last time he\npassed out was in 6th grade and it was because he smelled fish,\nwhich he is allergic to. Youth A reported how he felt when he\npassed out that time is exactly how he felt this time. Youth A\nreported he felt he should have gone to the hospital because his\nleft leg, left arm, and head hurt. Youth A reported he thinks the\npain was probably from him passing out and falling out of the chair\nonto the floor. Youth A reported on 6/27/25, his arm still hurt, he\nwas wheezing, and his chest hurt. Youth A reported he saw a\ndoctor on Saturday (6/28/25) or Sunday (6/29/25), and then again\non Monday (6/30/25).\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/2/25\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported he\nknows Youth A well because Youth A is his sister’s baby’s father,\nand the baby is due soon. Youth B reported on 6/26/25, he\nreceived news his sister was taken away from their grandmother’s\ncare. Youth B reported he was upset and crying after he found\nout. Youth B reported he told Youth A the news, and Youth A\nbegan to get upset and began crying as well. Youth B reported he\ndoesn’t know of anything happening after Youth A received the\nnews. Youth B reported he has had a few medical issues since\nbeing at the facility and he has seen a doctor. Youth B reported\nstaff have always taken care of his medications and treatment\nwithout issue.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via phone on 7/2/25\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker. CA reported Staff 1 was\nterminated on Friday (6/27/25) for insubordination. CA reported\nStaff 1 was out of line on many things and frequently argued with\nother staff and supervisors. CA reported Staff 1 would frequently\nget into other staff’s faces about medical situations and would say\nstaff needed to do certain things, or question what staff were\ndoing. CA reported Staff 1 was not assigned or trained to pass\nmedications, so he shouldn’t have been questioning what other\nstaff were doing or telling them what they should be doing. CA\n4",
    "reported Youth A had an inhaler and nebulizer and had been\nunder doctor’s care for his cough and breathing. CA reported\nYouth A had a chest x-ray on 6/26/25 and the doctor called on\n6/27/25 to let them know nothing was wrong and to continue with\nthe inhaler and nebulizer treatments as needed. CA reported she\nwas not aware of Youth A reporting chest or arm pain after the\nincident.\nTeam Leader 1 (TL1) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 7/2/25 in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. TL1\nreported on 6/26/25, Youth A not only received the news about his\npregnant girlfriend in the evening, but earlier in the day he was\nresentenced. TL1 reported Youth A had a lot going on which\nmade him upset. TL1 reported he spoke with Youth A on 6/27/25\nin the morning and Youth A reported his stomach hurt because he\nwas so worried about his girlfriend. Youth A told TL1 nothing\nhappened the night before, and he was just upset because he\nwanted to go home. TL1 reported Youth A told him he didn’t need\nany medication or medical care; he just wanted to know where his\ngirlfriend was and what was going on with her. TL1 reported he\nwasn’t present for the situation on 6/26/25, but he read the\nincident report and there was nothing concerning noted. TL1\nreported Youth A had a follow-up doctor’s appointment on Monday\n(6/30/25) and the doctor cleared him, stating everything was fine,\nand he no longer needed his prescription for Prednisone.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n7/2/25 in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor\nreported on 6/26/25, Youth A found learned his girlfriend was\nremoved from her grandmother’s care. Youth A was crying from\napproximately 8pm-8:20pm. Supervisor reported Youth A was\nreally upset and requested to use his nebulizer, so Supervisor\nreported he and Staff 1 were sitting with Youth A while they were\ngetting it prepped. Supervisor reported they went to complete\nobservation checks on other youth in their rooms, and when he\nreturned, Youth A was lying on the floor with Staff 1 next to him.\nSupervisor reported Staff 1 told him Youth A fell over and passed\nout on the floor. Supervisor reported Youth A wasn’t verbally\nresponsive, his eyes were closed, but he was breathing.\nSupervisor reported Youth A’s oxygen and pulse were within\nnormal range. Supervisor reported he called on-call and CA to tell\nthem what was happening. Supervisor reported since Youth A\ndidn’t respond to his name, he was going to try smelling salts to\nsee if Youth A would respond to those and wake up. Supervisor\nreported he went to get smelling salts, but when he got back,\nYouth A was already up. Supervisor reported Youth A was passed\n5",
    "out on the floor for approximately 15 minutes before he woke up.\nSupervisor reported Youth A stated he was dizzy, but okay.\nSupervisor reported Youth A did not complain of any chest, arm,\nor any other pain while he was present. Supervisor reported he\nprovided Youth A with water, and around 9:30pm, Youth A used\nthe nebulizer. Supervisor reported after Youth A went to bed, he\nwas on 5-minute observation checks to make sure he was okay.\nSupervisor reported he sat with Youth A until 10:15pm, and there\nwere no concerns or issues. Supervisor reported he left around\n12am on 6/27/25. Supervisor reported he put Youth A on the list to\nsee the doctor on Monday (6/30/25). Supervisor reported when he\nspoke with Team Leader 2 and CA, he was instructed Youth A did\nnot need to go to the hospital, but if the situation changed/became\nworse, to call an ambulance. Supervisor reported Staff 1 showed\ncare and concern towards Youth A during the incident. However,\nSupervisor reported Staff 1 was very pushy and immediately\nwanted to call 911 and have Youth A taken to the hospital.\nSupervisor reported he told Staff 1 what their instructions were,\nand Staff 1 continued to be pushy. Supervisor reported he\nfollowed up with Staff 1 after the incident, and Staff 1 disclosed an\nincident at a previous job that triggered him to want Youth A to be\nseen at the hospital as soon as possible. Supervisor reported he,\nCA and Team Leader 2 never insinuated or implied Youth A was\nfaking the incident or trying to get attention.\nTeam Leader 2 (TL2) was interviewed via phone on 7/7/25 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. TL2 reported she received a\ncall from Supervisor on 6/26/25 because she was on call.\nSupervisor stated Youth A received upsetting news about his\ngirlfriend and became upset and emotional. TL2 reported\nSupervisor told her he was going to give Youth A his nebulizer\ntreatment, but then Youth A put his head in his hands and then\nlaid on the floor. Supervisor told TL2 Youth A was breathing and\nhad a pulse. TL2 reported their CPR instructor taught them if\nsomeone passes out, but is breathing, then they use smelling\nsalts, or a sternum rub to see if they respond. TL2 reported she\ninstructed Supervisor to do the pulse-ox meter to check his status\nfirst, and it came back normal. Supervisor reported she then\nadvised him to use the smelling salts and then the sternum rub.\nTL2 reported Supervisor called her back, and right when he was\nabout to use the smelling salts, Youth A sat up. TL2 reported it\nwas apparent from the situation, it was Youth A’s emotional\nreaction which caused him to pass out rather than it being\nevidence of a medical issue. TL2 reported the following day TL1\nreviewed the video, and there were no concerns noted. TL2\nreported the doctor saw Youth A and verified he was medically\n6",
    "fine. TL2 reported when she talked to Youth A, Youth A was very\nemotionally fixated on what was going on with his girlfriend. TL2\nreported Youth A repeatedly said he was fine, and said he put his\nhead in his hands the previous night because he was overly\nemotional.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 6/26/25 was reviewed, and it does not have\naudio. Supervisor and Youth A are seen sitting in chairs across\nfrom each other at a table in the main pod area. Staff 1 is standing\nand walking around by Youth A. Youth A is hunched over in the\nchair. Staff 1 picks up a chair, sets it within 5 feet of Youth A, and\nsits down facing Youth A. Supervisor gets up and walks down the\nbedroom hallway. At 8:41pm, Youth A falls forward out of the chair\nand his knees, face & head hit the floor first. Then his shoulder,\narm and legs hit the floor, so he is laying on his stomach/side.\nStaff 1 gets up, stands over Youth A, and rolls him onto his side.\nSupervisor comes back and then goes into the office/observation\nroom while Staff 1 lays Youth A on his back. Staff 1 sits by Youth\nA on the floor, and it appears he is monitoring Youth A’s vitals.\nSupervisor opens the observation room/office door a couple times\nand then closes it again. Staff 1 continues to sit on the floor and\nmonitor Youth A. Staff 1 then turns Youth A onto his side and\nkneels next to him, holding his back/shoulder so he remains on his\nside. Staff 1 holds Youth A’s wrist, and it appears he is checking\nhis pulse. At 8:49pm, Supervisor comes out of the office, reaches\ndown to check on Youth A, and then enters another room. Staff 1\ncontinues to sit on the floor near Youth A and puts his hand on\nYouth A’s wrist every so often. At 8:52pm, Supervisor comes out\nof the room and talks to Staff 1. Supervisor then enters another\ndoor into another room. At 8:53pm, Supervisor exits that room and\nre-enters the office/observation room. At 8:55pm, Supervisor exits\nthe office/observation room and then reenters it. At 8:56pm,\nSupervisor exits the office/observation room again, and hands a\nphone to Staff 1. Staff 1 is looking at the phone while Supervisor\nbends over to check on Youth A. Supervisor then goes into\nanother room. At 8:57pm, Supervisor comes out of the room, goes\nby the table, pulls out the chair, and then taps Youth A. Supervisor\nstands back up, and then leans over to tap Youth A again. At\n8:58pm, Youth A wakes up and Staff 1 helps him sit up. Staff 1\nimmediately takes off his sweatshirt. Staff 1 sits on the floor next\nto Youth A while Supervisor sits in the chair at the table.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident Report dated 6/26/25 authored by Supervisor was\nconsistent with Supervisor’s interview.\n7",
    "• Youth A’s admission medical report dated 6/23/25 notes\nYouth A had left knee pain after falling on a glass bottle and\nhitting his knee cap. He was diagnosed with moderate,\npersistent asthma. He already had an inhaler, but he was\nalso prescribed Prednisone.\n• Youth A’s medical report dated 6/30/25 notes his left knee\npain is better. Youth A finished the steroid pack\n(Prednisone) he was prescribed for his asthma. His asthma\nis better, and he does not have any chest pain, shortness\nof breath, wheezing, and only has a very rare cough. Youth\nA reported he passed out the evening on 6/26/25. He\ndescribed being very worked up, even crying at moments\nprior to the incident. Youth A began feeling short of breath\nand decided he needed to take treatment via his inhaler.\nHe subsequently passed out shortly after treatment. Youth\nA remembers feeling anxious when waking up, but\nphysically well. No medical evaluation or call to the on call\nnumber was made. He remained in his room the rest of the\nevening and staff made regular checks throughout the\nevening. Medical report noted Syncope (aka “loss of\nconsciousness”) sounded like a vasovagal episode (aka\n“sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure leading to\nfainting, often in reaction to a stressful trigger”) from acute\nanxiety. His history of knowing the events leading up to and\nimmediately after are not consistent with seizure activity.\nThere is no history of him complaining about cardiac\nsymptoms or history of cardiac disease. His cardiac,\nneurological, and psych exam were normal today. There is\nno evidence of this being an emergency need.\n• Unimpeded Access to Care Policy notes when a youth\nreports illness or medical problems to staff, the staff shall\ncomplete a medical complaint form for the youth to have\naccess to the health care providers/physicians. Health care\nproviders/physicians make routine visits at least twice\nweekly (normally Mondays and Thursdays) unless\nunforeseen circumstances arise and are available via\nphone as needed for all youth.\n• Emergency Care Policy states the facility provides for 24-\nhour emergency medical care availability including: on-site\nemergency first aid and crisis intervention, arrangements\nfor the emergency evacuation and transfer of youth from\nthe facility, arrangements for the use of an emergency\n8",
    "medical vehicle, arrangements for emergency on-call\nassistance from Oaklawn Hospital. In medical emergencies\nthat pose a risk to the physical well-being of the youth, staff\nshall transport the youth to Oaklawn Hospital ER for more\nadvanced care when indicated by the nature of the\nemergency or by the direction of Whole Family Direct Care.\nSupervisor shall notify the facility’s director, assistant\ndirector, team leader and On-Call Administrator (if after\nhours).\n• Supervisor has one disciplinary action in his employee file,\nunrelated to this investigation. Supervisor was trained in\nCPR/First Aid on 8/12/24 and medical/emergency policies\non 5/6/22 and 9/26/23.\n• Staff 1 did not have any formal disciplinary actions in his\nemployee file. Staff 1 was hired on 6/6/25 and was\nterminated on 6/28/25 for insubordination and boundary\ncrossing because of this incident as well as other\nsituations. Staff 1 was trained on medical/emergency\npolicies on 6/6/25. There is no record of Staff 1 having\nCPR/First Aid training.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as per interviews conducted\nand documentation reviewed, Youth A was assessed and\nmonitored by facility staff while he was passed out. Supervisor\ncommunicated with CA and TL2 to receive directions on what\nsteps to follow, and he followed those steps. Per the facility’s\npolicy, Supervisor created a medical request for Youth A to be\nseen on Monday 6/30/25, and Youth A was seen by the physician.\nThe medical note dated 6/30/25 confirms Youth A passed out due\nto acute anxiety caused by a stressful trigger. The medical note\nalso states there is no evidence of this being an emergency need.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\n• Although there is no indication a call to 911 to request an\nambulance or hospital trip was warranted, Youth A’s\nmedical note dated 6/30/25 states no medical evaluation or\ncall to on-call was made. Since the facility has access to\n24-hour on call physicians/health care providers, they\nshould be consulted in future situations of this nature or\nother medical emergencies, and those consultations should\nbe documented in the incident report completed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n9",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nAugust 11, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 13, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n10"
