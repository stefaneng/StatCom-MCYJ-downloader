EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP received from the agency was in response to the 7/31/2023 licensing renewal\ninspection report and was approved on 8/8/2023. That CAP addressed 16\nviolations (1 PA 116, 11 rule, 4 policy.) The agency was able to achieve and\nmaintain compliance with eight of the violation areas addressed through the CAP.\nThe remaining eight areas (Il agreements, IL case closure, adoptive family\nassessments, FTMs, social work contacts, PATP signatures, and medical\npassports) were found to be repeated violations during this inspection and will\nrequire additional corrective action planning to address why the previous CAP was\nunsuccessful. Additionally, the agency was found in violation of the initial medical\nrequirements and four rule subsections related to the information provided to\ncaregivers at placement that were not in violation in 2023; however, were\npreviously addressed in the 2022 interim licensing inspection and subsequent\nCAP approved on 6/28/2022. Three violations were established during this\ninspection not previously established in the 2022 or 2023 inspections. Each of\nthose violations were isolated incidents. Overall, the agency has decreased the\nnumber of individual incidents within all except two violation areas (PATP\nsignatures & IL agreements) with the majority of the violations established in one\nfile of each sample reviewed.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed and discussed during the\nentrance meeting. The Chief Administrator identified areas of noncompliance\nrelated to a foster care worker who left the agency after which it was discovered\nshe has falsified multiple documents. The falsified documents were removed\nresulting in some of the files missing required documentation. Additional areas of\nnoncompliance were related to timeliness in completion of reports and documents\nas a result of emergency situations.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency budget and consolidated financial report which included an audit\ncompleted by an independent auditor were reviewed and no financial concerns\nwere noted.\nStaff Interviews\nFoster care, adoption, and licensing staff were interviewed. They all reported\npositive experiences working at the agency and noted they receive ongoing\nsupport from leadership. They all stated they receive regular supervision, have\nconsistent team meetings, and receive updates to policy/rule/agency requirements\ntimely. They stated their individual supervisors utilized spreadsheets and\nchecklists to assist them with timeliness of task completion.",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has adequate space and equipment for the delivery of foster care,\nindependent living, foster home certification, and adoption services. Physical CHRI\nis stored in a locked cabinet within a locked room. Physical case files are also\nstored in a locked file room within an office that can only be accessed with a key\nfob. A cross shredder is also present in the office.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJuly 8, 2024\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 8, 2024\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
