FP reported she was being threatened that Youth A\nand Youth B were going to be removed from her home because\nshe advocated against a dangerous decision. When asked where\nthis information came from, FP did not state who threatened her to\nremove Youth A or Youth B from her care or where this\ninformation came from.\nFP reported and identified Chief Administrator in regard to writing\na court report that had falsified information. She did not state\nwhen this report was written. FP reported she wrote a letter on\n4/23/2025, addressing Guardian ad Litem (GAL), Department of\nHealth and Human Services (DHHS) attorney, Livingston County\nProsecutor, Community Mental Health (CMH) Therapist, DHHS\nProgram Manager and DHHS current Foster Care Worker (FCW)\nand Supervisor of Youth A and Youth B’s case. FP reported she\nwrote this letter because she felt this was defamation of her\ncharacter and false information had been submitted to the courts.\nFP reported she formally addressed a series of deeply concerning\nand factually incorrect claims that have been made about her care\nfor Youth A. FP reported specifically, it was stated she declined\nmultiple services for Youth A and this was unequivocally false.\nWhen asked where this information came from, FP alluded to\nnurses’ notes from Mott’s University of Michigan (UM) Hospital\n2",
    "that stated, the preference is for Youth A to get some sleep while\nin “CES” and to be reevaluated the next morning. The writer (No\nname provided) informed FP that Partial Hospitalization Program,\n(PHP) would be unlikely to take Youth A due to his level of\nbehavioral dysregulation. FP was provided with nurse’s notes from\nCMH and Mott’s UM Hospital. Please note, this was unable to be\nprovided for consultant review as this information would involve\nHIPPA law.\nFP continued to state the report claimed she refused services,\nsuch as the Wraparound Program through CMH. However, this\ndecision was made based on direct guidance from the therapist at\nCMH. FP reported she was advised that participation in\nwraparound would restrict access to other CMH programs that\nwere more appropriate and beneficial for Youth A’s specific needs.\nFP reported to suggest she declined services is not only\ninaccurate, but it was also slanderous.\nFP reported DHHS Attorney asserted that children were not safe\nin her care and this contradiction was both harmful and absurd.\nFP reported DHHS Attorney repeatedly made false and damaging\nstatements about her and her parenting skills. FP said this\ninformation was in the Court Orders.\nPlease note, in review of the court orders, there were no\nstatements found that that presented defamation of FP’s\ncharacter.\nChief Administrator (CA) and Program Manager (PM) were\ninterviewed via TEAM on 5/22/2025. CA and PM reported there\nwere no court reports written by either of them or DHHS staff. CA\nand PM reported at the time of going back and forth to court for\nhearing, etc., Family and Community Services had management\nresponsibility of report writing.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW), through Family and Community\nServices, was interviewed on 6/4/23, via telephone. FCW\nreported Family and Community Services did not write any court\nreports because the case was never adjudicated therefore her\nagency never had full jurisdiction/responsibility over the case.\nFCW said her agency never received permission to do services\nover the case. She said the court order/report came from\nLivingston County prosecutor’s office and that’s who wrote the\ncourt order. FCW said the case was in the pre-trial stages and did\nnot move quickly.\n3",
    "DOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Social work contact dated 4/17/2025, written by FCW that\ninvolved FP, DHHS PM and GAL. FP discussed information\nshe received that a motion was filed in court to remove Youth\nA from her care, and she was upset that an accusation was\nmade that she was not meeting Youth A’s needs. FCW and\nDHHS PM reported to FP that they were unaware of such\nmotion and reassured FP the agencies were not aware of any\nplan to move Youth A from her care\n• FP provided the Clinical Review Summary of Youth A, which\nnoted the denial of services reported by FP. However, this is\nnot a court report written by foster care workers.\n• Motion to disqualify attorney/GAL: Exhibit B-page 2, dated\n4/6/2025, stated, the team including GAL and FP discussed\nsafety planning following discharge from Mott’s UM Hospital.\nAreas stated, the hopes are that medication concerns will be\naddressed; PHP was offered to FP, but she declined;\nLivingston Community Mental Health is actively working to\nplan bolstered supports in FP home; and FP has declined\nseveral proposed services. Services were not identified.\nAnalysis Violation is not established. DHHS did not write or falsify any court\nreports to the court, nor did they hold case responsibility. The\nclinical review summary does note the decline of services,\nhowever this is not a court report written by foster care to the\ncourts.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12413\nSection Medical and dental care policy\nDescription • (1) An agency's medical and dental care policy must,\ninclude all the following:\n• (b) The provision of emergency medical, surgical,\nand dental care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A remains hospitalized for 13 days while DHHS failed to\ncooperate with his team, causing unnecessary trauma to a child\nalready in crisis.\nInvestigation Foster Parent (FP) was interviewed via telephone on\n5/23/2025. FP reported she was not provided needed medical\n4",
    "care for Youth A. FP reported Youth A had a meltdown the first\ntime on 2/28/2025, and she took him to Mott’s UM Hospital. FP\nreported the attending physician mentioned to her the possibility of\ninpatient care for Youth A but, she expressed explicitly clear to the\nattending physician that if inpatient treatment was deemed\nnecessary, she would fully support that decision. FP reported after\nthe physician observed Youth A; he determined that inpatient\ntreatment was not appropriate nor available for Youth A during this\ntime. No explanation was provided.\nFP reported after Youth A broke Youth B’s finger and Youth A put\nYouth B’s head through a wall, she took him to his pediatrician for\nobservation. FP reported after she discussed Youth A’s current\nbehaviors with Pediatrician and Pediatrician observing Youth A on\n3/3/2025, Pediatrician recommended Youth A to be on medication\nto control his behaviors and wrote a prescription for the\nmedications of Clonidine and Concerta. FP reported she and\nYouth A’s Pediatrician decided this was an emergency situation\nand the prescriptions were filled, and she started giving the\nmedications to Youth A. FP admitted she was aware that Youth\nA’s Birth Father had not signed consent for Youth A to take\npsychotropic medications and therefore, she called and reported\nthe medications to Youth A’s Foster Care Worker (FCW) through\nFamily and Community Services, to get her feedback regarding\nadministering the medications to Youth A without Birth Father’s\nconsent. FP reported FCW informed her she would discuss the\nsituation with her supervisor and get back with her.\nFP reported FCW called her and reported she reached out to her\nsupervisor and was informed to reach out to DHHS as DHHS was\nnot assigned case management but ultimately had case\nresponsibility. FP reported FCW informed her Birth Father had\nnot provided consent for Youth A to take the medication and when\nFCW called DHHS to discuss the medication, she was informed\nby DHHS Program Manager, since Birth Father had not provided\npermission/consent for Youth A to take medications, the\nmedications had to be stopped until consent from Birth Father was\ngiven. FP reported FCW informed her she would contact Youth\nA’s Guardian ad Litem (GAL) to discuss the situation/medications\nwith her.\nFP reported Youth A’s GAL informed her she was going to obtain\na court order for consent to continue Youth A on the medications\nhe was taking. FP reported the motion to file for consent took time\ndue to several court hearings and the courts having to hear\ntestimonies from Youth A’s school, FP, and Youth A’s pediatrician.\n5",
    "FP reported after Referee heard the testimonies, a\nrecommendation to administer the medication to Youth A was\ngranted on or around 2/10/2025. FP reported on 3/12/2025, an\nEmergency Objection and Request for Judicial Review was filed.\nShe said on 3/21/2025 the Judge presiding over the case denied\nReferee’s recommendation for consent and stated the court and\nDHHS may not consent to psychotropic medication, and the order\nwas denied. FP reported it was Livingston County DHHS’s private\nattorney on behalf of DHHS who appealed to the medications\nbeing administered to Youth A stating it was against DHHS policy,\nand the policy was not followed. FP reported she stopped the\nmedications abruptly for Youth A.\nFP reported Youth A had another meltdown on 3/29/2025 and was\ntaken to Mott’s UM Hospital ER where he was admitted. FP\nreported Youth A, “turned into baby hulk,” and it took several\nhospital staff to hold Youth A down and stop him from kicking,\nbiting, and trying to hurt himself and others. She reported the\nsame attending physician that worked with Youth A on 2/28/2025,\nwas in the ER observing Youth A’s behavior. FP reported the\nhospital staff administered the same medications to Youth A that\nhe was on prior from the pediatrician’s office.\nFP reported she did not feel Youth A would be safe if he was\ndischarged from the hospital without the medications and that the\nattending physicians agreed with her and stated Youth A was not\ngoing to be released without a court order to consent to Youth A\ncontinuing on the medications provided to him by the hospital.\nChief Administrator (CA) and Program Manager (PM) were\ninterviewed via TEAM on 5/22/2025. CA repeated the\ndepartment did not take case responsibility until 4/23/2025. CA\nreported until then the case was managed by a private agency,\nFamily and Community Services. CA reported DHHS did file an\nappeal of Referee’s recommendation of consenting to medication\nbeing administered, as policy for psychotropics medication was\nnot followed. CA reported DHHS had numerous conversations\nwith DHHS’s attorney representative and Family and Community\nServices FCW. DHHS decided to file the motion. The Judge\nagreed with DHHS’s appeal and ordered not to administer the\nmedications, as Birth Father did not consent. CA reported she\nand PM had conversations with the attending physician from\nMott’s UM Hospital, as well as Family and Community Services\nFCW, in furtherance of DHHS eventual motion to request\nmedication.\n6",
    "PM reported FP reached out to her on 3/26/2025, because she\nwas aware that DHHS Attorney was involved in Youth A’s\nmedications being stopped due to DHHS policy not being followed\nand to discuss Youth A’s medication being stopped abruptly by\nFP. She reported she informed FP that DHHS employees\ninvolved in the case, including herself, were not medical\nprofessionals and were unable to provide her with medical advice.\nPM reported she shared with FP that if FP felt it was an\nemergency for Youth A to receive the medications that was\nstopped abruptly, to proceed to the nearest emergency room if\ncare is needed after hours or see a physician during business\nhours. PM reported she informed FP to continue to monitor Youth\nA for withdrawals or other effects and if these types of behaviors\nexist, to take Youth A to the nearest emergency room or call 911.\nPM reported DHHS had to appeal the decision of the Referee\nbecause the department did not have a prescribing physician and\na correct diagnosis for Youth A. She reported DHHS reached out\nto the physician who worked with Youth A when he went to Mott’s\nUM Hospital. PM reported the physician agreed to serve as the\nprescribing physician for Youth A on 4/1/2025 as he was familiar\nwith Youth A’s case.\nPM reported DHHS received the court order by the Judge on\n4/9/2025 for Youth A’s medication to be administered. PM\nreported DHHS had been in contact with legal affairs on the case\nextensively. PM provided a breakdown of DHHS’s involvement\nwith the case and the courts prior to taking responsibility of the\ncase. She reported DHHS had to file a motion for an appeal of\nReferee’s recommendation for the medication to be administered\nto Youth A on 2/10/2025. PM reported the administering of the\nmedication for Youth A was denied on 3/21/2025. PM reported\nDHHS filed a motion to consent to medication on 4/3/2025, and\nthe Judge agreed to the administration of the medication to Youth\nA on 4/9/2025. PM reported during this time; Youth A and Youth B\nwere never removed from FP.\nPM reported DHHS opened a special investigation on foster home\non 4/23/2025, when the case was returned back to DHHS\nbecause FP consented to administer psychotropic medication to\nYouth A on 2/28/2025, though the emergency no longer existed.\nPM reported FP continued to provide this medication to Youth A\nwithout a consent from 2/28/2025 – 3/27/2025. PM reported Birth\nFather did not consent and his rights are still intact. PM reported\nFP failed to report harm to other children in the home timely and\nFP failed to safety plan for early discharge for Youth A from the\n7",
    "hospital’s emergency admission on 3/30/2025. PM reported FP\nrefused partial hospitalization during March’s hospitalization\noffered by CMH. PM reported Livingston DHHS requested that\nWashtenaw DHHS complete the special investigation.\nFCW through Family and Community Services, was\ninterviewed on 6/4/23, via telephone. She reported the hospital\nwould not discharge Youth A without medication; therefore, the\nhospital was the reason Youth A was in the hospital for 13 days.\nShe said the attending physician at the hospital felt Youth A\nneeded to be on medication, and he should not be taken off the\nmedication drastically and that it would do harm to his body. FCW\nsaid FP was not willing to take Youth A back into her home\nwithout the medications.\nFCW reported FP decided this was an emergency situation and\ndecided on her own to allow Youth A to be prescribed and take\npsychotropic medication. FCW reported FP did not discuss the\ndecision of Youth A taking the medication with her until after he\nwas prescribed and was taking the medication. FCW reported she\nwas unaware that it was a psychotropic medication. FCW reported\nBirth Father did not consent to psychotropic medication to be\nprescribed to Youth A; therefore, the medication had to be\nstopped.\nFCW reported she contacted the pediatrician’s office to discuss\nhow to stop the medication without causing harm to Youth A. She\nreported she left messages and talked with the receptionist. FCW\nsaid the receptionist said she would deliver the message to\nPediatrician, and Pediatrician would give her a call back. FCW\nreported she waited a week and received no call back. FCW\nreported her supervisor called the pediatrician’s office on\n3/26/2025 and 3/27/2025 and did not receive a response. FCW\nreported FP took Youth A off of the medication abruptly. FCW\nsaid Youth A was taken to the pediatrician’s office often for\ncheckups to make sure he would not suffer any damage due to\nbeing taken off the medication abruptly. She reported the medical\npersonnel were checking his blood pressure and for any other\npotential side effects from no longer taking the medication and\nnone was found.\nPediatrician was interviewed on 7/21/2025 via telephone. She\nreported she is and has been Youth A’s pediatrician since he\nentered foster care on July 17, 2022. She reported she completes\nYouth A’s well-child examinations, as well as monitoring his\nmedications. She reported she has had medical appointments\n8",
    "with Youth A over twelve times discussing his behaviors with FP.\nShe reported she first became familiar with Youth A when Birth\nFather brought Youth A to her office for a well-being check-up\nbecause Birth Father was allowing FP to be a babysitter for Youth\nA and his siblings. She said the medical appointments were\nencouraged by FP. Pediatrician reported over the years, Youth\nA’s behavior became physically aggressive, and she\nrecommended he start taking medication on 3/3/2025. She\nreported Youth A was out of control and he had started hurting\nhimself and Youth B. She reported she was unaware Birth Father\nhad not provided his consent for Youth A to take the medication.\nShe reported after the medication was discontinued by FP, she\nprovided regular checkups with Youth A taking his blood work and\nmonitoring for any side effects. She reported nothing was noted\nbut, Youth A’s behaviors continued to be inconsistent/aggressive\nuntil FP took him to a hospital emergency department. She\nprovided no further information.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Pediatric report signed and dated by Pediatrician on 3/3/2025.\nThe report recommends that Youth A take medication as\nprescribed; Concerta in morning, Clonidine in evening, ensure\nregular meals and snacks throughout the day, establish\nconsistent bedtime routine and monitor for side effects.\n• Memo from attending Physician dated 3/30/2025. The memo\nstates:” We are physicians caring for Youth A and are writing\nto express our strong recommendation that Youth A should be\nplaced back on the psychotropic medication regimen. He was\nnoted to be highly hyperactive, impulsive, and irritable by the\nPsychiatry team. In summary, his behavior deteriorated\nsignificantly after stopping psychotropic medications with\nimminent harm posed to Youth As foster mother and a sibling\nin the home, as well as to himself. He cannot be safely cared\nfor this time without treating his underlying psychiatric\nconditions. Youth A is suffering clear harm and is a safety risk\nto himself and others now that we are no longer treating his\nestablished psychiatric conditions, including Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder -Combined Type and Trauma and\nStressor Related Disorder. The attending Physician strongly\nrecommend that Youth A be placed back on his home\nmedications as soon as possible. In the attending physician\nprofessional opinion, withholding these necessary\npsychotropic medications places Youth A at risk for immediate\nharm, as well as for potentially lifelong impairment.\n• Court Order signed 3/11/2025, written by GAL stating, It is\nordered that upon LGAL providing documentation from the\n9",
    "pediatrician follow up visit with Youth A to the parties and\ncourts, DHHS shall consent to psychotropic medication for\nYouth A for reasons stated on the record. Medication shall\ncontinue to be administered to Youth A. The required\ndocumentation shall be provided for no less than 14 days.\nThis court order was denied on 3/21/2025.\n• Court Order dated 3/21/2025, Emergency objection and\nrequest per judicial review of referee’s recommendation filed\n3/12/2025, request to review the referee's recommendation.\nThe order states, “DHHS objects to the referee’s\nrecommendation, which orders DHHS consent to the\nadministration of psychotropic medications, Clonidine and\nConcerta to Youth A based on an emergency exception\ncontained in the DHHS policy manual and despite his parent’s\nobjection to the administration of the medication. A child’s\nparent must consent to a child’s use of psychotropic\nmedication for a child in foster care and only if a child’s parent\nis unavailable may a party seek consent from the court. In\nthis case the minor’s parent is available and does not consent\nto administration of the psychotropic medication. Therefore,\nPetitioners Emergency Objection and Request for Judicial\nReview ordering DHHS to consent to administration of\npsychotropic medication is granted and the referee’s\nrecommendation is denied.\n• Court Order dated 4/8/2025, Findings of Fact and Referee\nRecommendation following Emergency Hearing. The court\norder states that the department has proven by clear and\nconvincing evidence that psychotropic medication is medically\nnecessary for the treatment of Youth A’s ADHD and Trauma\nand stress-related disorder. The Judge finds that the\ndepartment has proven by clear and convincing evidence that\nthe recommended psychotropic medications are in Youth A’s\nbest interest. The Judge recommends the Court order the\ndepartment shall consent to medical treatment for\nadministration for the administration of psychotropic\nmedication of Clonidine and Concerta as recommended by his\ntreating physician. The department presents the testimony of\nMott’s UM Hospital physician and Youth A’s Pediatrician\nsupporting the use of Clonidine and Concerta is an\nemergency and medically necessary for Youth A. The\nattending physician is the Director of Child Psychiatry at the\nUniversity of Michigan Health System, and he treated Youth A\nat Mott UM Children’s Hospital during the two visits Youth A\ncame to emergency (ER). Pediatrician is Youth A’s long-time\nphysician since Youth A entered foster care in 2020 and has\n10",
    "been working with the Foster Parent and Youth A trying to\nassist in controlling his violent behavior.\n• DHHS Policy FOM 802-1 Psychotropic medication for youth in\nfoster care was reviewed. DHHS must follow their policy on\ngetting informed consent before psychotropic medication is\nadministered.\n• Special Investigation #2025SEC0000555, intake on\n4/23/2025, and completed on 7/11/2025, by Washtenaw\nDHHS. Recommendation, corrective action plan was\nestablished due to FP administering medication without\nhaving Birth Father consent.\n• FCW, social work contact dated 4/9/2025, regarding\npsychotropic medication. Youth A was given Zyprexa on\n3/30/2025 and 4/1/2025 from Mott’s UM Hospital due to\ndysregulation and uncontrollable behavior. FCW received a\ncourt order allowing Youth A to be administered Clonidine and\nZyprexa without Birth Father’s consent as Birth Father was\ndeemed unable to make an informed decision in the child’s\nbest interest.\nAnalysis There is insufficient evidence to support a violation. It is\nestablished by individual interviews, documentation reviewed that\nDHHS did not fail to cooperate with Youth A’s team, causing\nunnecessary trauma. DHHS did not have case management of\nthe case until 4/23/2025. It was established that an Emergency\nObjection and Request for Judicial Review of Referee’s\nrecommendation was filed 3/12/25, by DHHS Attorney regarding\nadministrating psychotropic medication without the consent of the\nBirth Father.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418\nSection Development of service plans\nDescription • (1) An agency shall develop service plans with the child,\nthe child's parents or legal guardian, the referring agency,\nand other parties involved in providing needed services or\nmedical care, unless the agency documents why any of the\nentities have not been involved.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation FP reported she has never been involved in Youth A or Youth B’s\ndevelopment of service plans or the Parent Agency Treatment\nPlan.\n11",

FCW reported FP\nwas involved with all updated Service Plans and Parent Agency\nTreatment Plans of Youth A and Youth B. She reported her input,\nand concerns were how to control Youth A’s outburst. FCW\nreported FP discussed and provided feedback by identifying Youth\nA and Youth B’s behaviors. FCW reported Youth A and Youth B\nhad significant behaviors, however, Youth A’s behaviors were\nmore physically aggressive than Youth B. FCW reported Youth A\nhad serious meltdowns and would become physically violent and\nattack Youth B. FCW reported FP informed her that Youth A\nbroke Youth B’s finger and Youth A put Youth B’s head through a\nwall.\nFCW reported she and FP discussed Youth A receiving a trauma\nassessment for his outburst behaviors. FCW reported before\nYouth A was registered to receive CMH services for a trauma\nassessment, Youth A was suspended from school due to his\naggressive and out of control behaviors. FCW reported she\ndiscussed Youth A’s suspension from school with FP and FP was\ninfuriated due to having to leave her employment to pick Youth A\nup from school again due to him acting out and having outbursts.\n12",

    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted following allegations by a foster parent that Livingston County DHHS falsified court reports, withheld necessary medical care for a youth, and excluded the foster parent from service planning. The investigation found that DHHS was not managing the case during the period in question, as it was under a private agency's supervision, and thus did not write the contested court reports or service plans. Regarding medical care, DHHS appealed a referee's medication order due to policy requiring birth parent consent, which a judge later upheld, but the subsequent delay in treatment was primarily attributed to hospital discharge protocols and legal processes. Ultimately, no violations of licensing rules were substantiated against the agency.",
