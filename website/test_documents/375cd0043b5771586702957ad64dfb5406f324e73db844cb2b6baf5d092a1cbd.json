According to DHHS Worker 1, police had interviewed\nStaff 2 and the agency had terminated Staff 2 from employment.\nDHHS Worker 1 reported on call worker completed interview with\nyouth.\nOn 1/24/2024, I spoke to Administrator 1 and discussed the\nallegations, documents, and scheduling of interviews. No\nadditional information was provided.\nOn 1/25/2024, I spoke to Complainant 1. No additional\ninformation was provided.\nThe following interviews were completed face to face on\n1/29/2024 at the facility:\nSupervisor 1:\nSupervisor 1 reported she was the supervisor on duty on\n1/20/2024. Supervisor 1 reported there were three youth and two\nstaff in the “Letts” house where the incident stemmed from.\nSupervisor 1 reported that on weekends, they sometimes have to\nfill shifts due to staff calling off and, on this day, they had Staff 2\ncome in to fill a shift. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 2 was a normal\nthird shift worker. Supervisor 1 reported at the beginning of the\nshift, she took Staff 2 aside and went over his “purple training\nsheets.” Staff 2 was fairly new and had never worked an afternoon\nshift. Supervisor 1 reported she went over how to address the\nyouth, telling him to redirect when needed but not to be\naggressive in that redirection. Supervisor 1 did meet with the other\nstaff working with Staff 2. Supervisor 1 reported she spoke to Staff\n3, directing her to train Staff 2. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 2 did\nnot yet have a set of keys of his own because he had not been\nemployed for three months. Supervisor 1 reported at three months\nstaff receive keys. This meant he was to observe, learn and follow\nthe lead staff on duty in the unit. At approximately 5:00pm/5:30pm,\nSupervisor 1 reported she was called on the radio to assist at the\n2",
    "“Letts” house. Supervisor 1 reported when she entered the unit,\nYouth A had flipped a desk and was loud with Staff 2. Supervisor\n1 reported she immediately attempted to deescalate Youth A.\nYouth A went to his door and Staff 2 followed him in what\nappeared to be challenging Youth A to a physical altercation.\nYouth A shut his door, Supervisor 1 went to the door and Staff 2\nbacked away from the door. Supervisor 1 opened the door\nattempting to talk to Youth A, then Youth A began threatening and\ncussing at Staff 2. Staff 2 then started cussing at him. At one point\nYouth A threatened to fight Staff 2 and Staff 2 replied with, “Lets\nget it going.” Supervisor 1 called for backup in the house and Staff\n1 came in. Staff 2 went into the staff office with Staff 3. Staff 2 was\nstill taunting Youth A through the office window, making gestures\nwith his arms wide open as if welcoming a physical altercation.\nSupervisor 1 reported she told Staff 2 he had to leave and go\nhome. Youth A attempted to get into the office but was unable to.\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 1 were able to remove the three youth,\nYouth A, Youth B and Youth C from the house to go to the gym\nbuilding. (It should be noted the two other youth were not involved\nin the incident and did stay out of the situation.) As they were\nwalking in the hallway of the gym, Youth A saw Staff 2 in the\nparking lot getting ready to leave and ran out of the gym after him.\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 1 left the other two youth with other staff\nand followed Youth A into the parking lot. Supervisor 1 reported\nhe and Staff 1 attempted many times to get Staff 2 to leave the\npremises, but he would not listen. Supervisor 1 reported they were\nattempting to deescalate Youth A by physically holding him back.\nStaff 2 had stated, “Are you gonna let those hoes hold you back?”\nYouth A got through Staff 1 and both Staff 2 and Youth A began\nhitting each other with closed fists. Both Supervisor 1 and Staff 1\nattempted to break them up. Staff 2 was able to “throw” Staff 1 out\nof his way, causing her to smack her head on the pavement. Staff\n3 then came out of the house and helped Staff 1. Staff 2 and\nYouth A began to fight again. Staff 2 then went to his car as if to\nget in, then stopped and said, “You are going to be scared when I\nget this out of my trunk.” Staff 2 attempted to open his trunk and at\nthis time, Supervisor 1 reported she told Youth A to go, and he\nlistened. Supervisor 1 reported it seemed like he was trying to tell\nthem he had a gun in his car but didn’t know for sure.

    "ok. Supervisor 1 reported at the end of her shift she talked to all\nstaff and was overall pleased with how they handled themselves\nin this situation.\nStaff 3 was not in the parking lot; therefore, did not witness the\nevents in the parking lot.\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 reported she was working the afternoon shift on 1/20/2024\nand heard a radio call for assistance.

Staff 1 reported she had lost\nconsciousness for a minute, but when she was able to focus, Staff\n2 was still there, and Staff 3 was helping her. Staff 1 reported Staff\n3 had called the police. Staff 1 was unable to provide any more\ninformation after she had been helped by Staff 3.\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported Staff 3 and Staff 2 were working the afternoon\nshift on 1/20/2024. Youth A reported Staff 2 was antagonizing the\nthree youth by telling them they were going to lose their points for\nthe day for no reason. Youth A reported he was getting upset so\nhe asked to go into his room. Youth A went into his room and Staff\n2 followed him. Youth A shut the door and he heard Staff 3 tell\nStaff 2 to “give him space.” Staff 2 then stated, “these boys need a\nman to discipline them.” Youth A came out of his room and\nreported he started arguing with Staff 2 and challenged him to\nfight. Youth A reported Staff 3 took Staff 2 in the office, and all\nthree youth went outside with Supervisor 1 and Staff 1. Youth A\nstated they went to the gym and then he saw Staff 2 outside, so\nhe ran after him. They both began arguing back and forth and\nStaff 2 and Youth A began fighting with closed fists. Youth A\nreported he was hit by Staff 2 on his right jaw line and right\nshoulder. Youth A reported Staff 2 also hit Staff 1. After he hit\nStaff 1, Youth A reported he went after Staff 2 again and they\nwere hitting each other. Youth A reported he was calling the staff,\n4",
    "“hoes” and “bitches”. Youth A reported when they stopped, Staff 2\nmade a comment about getting something out of his trunk, as if\ntelling them he had a gun in his car. Youth A did not know this for\nsure but this was what Youth A thought Staff 2 meant. Supervisor\n1, Staff 2, and Youth A left the area. Youth A reported Supervisor\n1 and Staff 1 were attempting to deescalate the situation. Youth A\nreported his finger hurt and he did receive medical care. Youth A\nreported he has talked to his mother and his therapist about the\nincident.\nAn attempt to contact Staff 2 was made on 2/5/2024. He declined\nto speak to DHHS Worker 1 and this consultant.\nVideo Footage:\nI reviewed video footage from 5:35pm-6:04pm in the house. There\nis no video footage outside in the parking lot. Youth A was\naggressive in the video and attempting to go after Staff 2 who was\nin the office. Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 were attempting to hold\nback Youth A but were unable to put him in a Non-Violent Crisis\nIntervention hold, although they did attempt. Youth A took his shirt\noff and attempted to go into the office. He flipped a couch over\nand pushed staff out of his way multiple times.\nAfter watching the video, I interviewed Administrator 1 concerning\nthe behavior of Youth A. Administrator 1 reported Youth A has\nbeen known to get physically aggressive if he does not get his\nway.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident Report completed 1/21/2024 at 12:01am. The\nincident date is for 1/20/2024. The incident report is in\naccordance with the interviews completed.\n• Eaton Rapids Medical Center Report dated 1/20/2024 for\nYouth A; diagnosis, finger and wrist sprain.\n• Personnel File of Staff 2. Staff 2 was hired on 11/29/2023\nas a “Part-Time Overnight Worker.” All clearances were\ncompleted, and training completed as outlined in Licensing\nRules for Child Caring Institutions.

    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: I reviewed Staff 2’s Job Description\nDetails signed by him. Staff 2 was hired specifically as an\n“Overnight Worker” with a “Decision Making” level at a “low level,\n2 on a 10 point scale.” Staff 2 was hired to monitor youth at\novernight hours and the success in completing that job is based\non the ability to, “supervise an assigned house or campus during\novernight hours, familiar with and practice current agency\npolicies…take necessary precautions for students identified as\nhigh risk and provide oversight of them as prescribed…maintain\ngood communication with day staff through exchange of relevant\ninformation…maintain alert and close supervision of students until\nproperly relieved by regularly assigned staff…”\nStaff 2 was specifically hired to work overnight hours.\nAdministrator 1 did report that, afternoon direct care workers have\na different job description. Administrator 1 reported they do use\novernight workers in afternoon shifts at times. Administrator 1\nreported this is how they promote from within as well. Staff 2 does\nnot have an afternoon direct care job description in his file. The\nagency allowed an overnight worker to fill a role that he was not\nhired for. If the agency would like to permit overnight workers to\nwork afternoon shifts, then the agency will need to update their\n“Overnight Worker Job Description” to align with those\nresponsibilities and decision making skills or consider creating one\nuniversal Direct Care Worker Job Description, expecting all direct\ncare staff to function at the same abilities.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Interventions and Prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a\nyouth’s background or appearance or mental state. Yelling,\nthreats, ridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 verbally threatened Youth A multiple times in the facility\nand in the parking lot of the facility.\n6",
