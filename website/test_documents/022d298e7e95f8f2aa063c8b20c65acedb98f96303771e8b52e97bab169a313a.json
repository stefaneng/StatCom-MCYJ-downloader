    "summary": "The investigation involved allegations that a youth (Youth B) sexually harassed and assaulted other residents at the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center. While the primary allegation of insufficient staff to protect residents was not substantiated, as staff were found to be actively redirecting and supervising Youth B (including using a 1:1 ratio), a procedural violation was substantiated. The facility failed to properly resolve grievances, issuing letters stating grievances were 'resolved' merely because they were forwarded to a sheriff's unit for investigation, without addressing the immediate safety concerns or final outcome. The facility is culpable for this administrative failure in its grievance process.",
    "violation": "y"
  },
  "sir_violation_level": {
    "level": "severe",
    "justification": "The substantiated violation is a failure to provide a written copy of the grievance resolution. The grievance itself pertained to Youth B's repeated sexual harassment, which included sexual comments, unwanted touching (e.g., hugging, touching buttocks), and exposing genitals to other youth. While the initial allegation of sexual assault was not substantiated, the underlying incidents prompting the grievance constitute youth-on-youth violence (sexual harassment and inappropriate physical contact) and raise serious safety risks. The facility's failure to properly resolve and document the outcome of this safety-related grievance aligns with the 'Severe' category for 'Safety and Violence'."
