She confirmed that Youth A had a safety\nblanket that she was trying to rip and bite during the incident in\nquestion. Therapist stated that it has been her experience with this\nspecific youth that any scraps of fabric like a ripped blanket can be\nused as means for self-harm when she is escalated. She stated that\nstaff had been trying to convince her and de-escalate her to lay down\nand communicated the whole time that she would be able to have her\nblanket back when she came back to baseline.

She stated that the\n2",
    "incident in question occurred about a week ago. There were several\nstaff involved, including Therapist. Youth A stated that she had run\naway from the facility earlier in the night and was picked up by law\nenforcement and brought back. She stated that she thought they were\n\"strangers\" at first. She admitted to being escalated while in the unit\nafter coming back and trying to tear up her safety blanket. She stated\nthat staff asked her if she was going to attempt to self-harm herself with\nthe blanket, and then stated that she has attempted this in the past.\nYouth A denied that she was attempting to harm herself. Youth A\nstated that staff took away her blanket temporarily at the instruction of\nTherapist. Youth A stated that at that point she was banging and\npunching the wall behind her bed and asked if she could call DHHS\nCentralized intake to report that she was not being given back her\nblanket. She stated that she knew it was 72° inside the unit at the time\nbecause there had been a conversation about the thermostat earlier in\nthe evening. At that point she was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Youth\nA stated that her sweatpants and sweatshirt were also temporarily\ntaken away in that moment. Youth A stated that she still did not have\nher blanket after a period of time and wanted to go to bed. Youth A\nrecalled requesting that she be able to call law enforcement, which the\nfacility allowed. After this phone call, Youth A stated that she began to\ncalm down, and that staff gave her a blanket back so that she could go\nto sleep. Youth A reiterated that she believed that she should not have\nhad the blanket taken away in the first place, and that she was not self-\nharming with the blanket at that moment.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews of staff and youth at the facility it was\nfound that there was not sufficient evidence to show that there was a\nrule violation. Youth A was brought back to the facility by Law\nEnforcement and Youth A's blanket was taken away temporarily as a\nsafety measure but was provided back to her upon her de-escalation.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
