    "01/08/2021 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nSince 2018, agency staff members are not exploring/utilizing relative placement\nregarding a foster care case.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 12/10/2020 and 12/28/2020 I reviewed the youth and provider case records in\nMiSACWIS. The files indicate that the youth were placed in foster care on\n4/29/2018. The following documentation related to Relative A was reviewed:\n 8/26/2019 – Central Registry form completed\n 11/26/2019 – Social Work contact, Relative A called the worker who was\nassigned the case at that time “screaming” and asking why she wasn’t called to\ntake placement of the children.\n 11/26/2019 - The worker mailed a central registry clearance request for Relative\nA to fill out.\n 12/3/2019 – Criminal history clearances were completed\n 12/10/2019 and 12/16/2019 – Messages were left for Relative A\n 12/23/2019 – Relative A began visits with the youth.\n 1/17/2020- Relative A left a voicemail message for the worker stating she wanted\nto adopt the children.\n 1/15/2020 an email request to Relative A for write ups regarding her criminal\nhistory\n 1/15/2020 - An internal relative referral form to licensing was completed by the\nworker\n 1/16/2020 – Written document by Relative A addressing criminal history\n 1/22/2020 – Signed consent for release of DHHS records\n 1/28/2020 – Criminal history/police reports from local police departments\n 4/8/2020 – A Relative Placement Safety Screen (DHHS-5770) recommending\ndenial of placement\n 5/19/2020 – Placement denial letter addressed to Relative A\nOn 12/29/2020 I interviewed Foster Care (FC) Worker 1 by phone. She reported that\nshe was assigned to the case at the beginning of 2020 and that Supervisor 1\npreviously had the case. She reported that when the case was transferred to her,\nher supervisor told her that Relative A and other relatives did not express interest in\nplacement of the children until the case was heading toward termination of parental\nrights. FC Worker 1 stated that Relative A has monthly visits with the children and is\ncurrently working with a licensing worker and an adoption worker regarding potential\nplacement/adoption of the children.\n3",
    "On 12/30/2020 I interviewed Relative A by phone. She reported that when her\ndaughter went to jail in April of 2018, three of her children were with Relative A.\nRelative A’s oldest daughter came to get the children after which Relative A received\na call from her daughter stating that the children were being removed from her home\nand placed into foster care. Relative A stated that she previously had custody of two\nof the children, so she believed the agency had her contact information, but she was\nnever contacted to take placement of the children. She stated that a worker came to\nher work the Monday after the children were placed into foster care and took a copy\nof Relative A’s ID and Social Security card. She stated that she never heard\nanything from the worker regarding whether or not she was approved for placement,\nso she called the agency multiple times. She reported that in May of 2018, a\ndifferent worker came to her home, completed a walk through and told her that her\nhome was sufficient for the children. When she again did not hear anything from the\nagency regarding placement of the children, she called and spoke to Supervisor 1\nwho told her that the worker who came to her home should not have done a\nwalkthrough and should never have told her that her home was adequate. Relative A\nstated that she never received any written documents related to that walkthrough\nand has been fighting to get placement of the children since. She stated that she did\nnot get visitation with the children until December of 2019 and only gets to see them\nonce a month for supervised visits. She stated that she is now working with the\nadoption and licensing departments to be considered for adoption of the children.\nOn 1/7/2021 I interviewed Supervisor 1 by phone. She reported that she is the\ncurrent supervisor on the case and had been assigned case management\nresponsibilities for a brief period in the final months of 2019 during worker transition\nand when termination of the children’s parental rights was being requested. She\nreported that, when she took over the case, one of the children’s paternal\ngrandfather was allowing Relative A to have visitation with the child during his\nunsupervised visits. When Supervisor 1 found out about this, she made the\ngrandfather’s visits supervised after which Relative A contacted her to arrange her\nown visitation in November of 2019. Relative A started having visits with the children\nthe following month but did not ask Supervisor 1 that she be considered for\nplacement of the children until January of 2020 at which point Supervisor 1 made a\nreferral to the licensing department for Relative A to be assessed. She stated that\nshe does not know if Relative A requested to be considered for placement of the\nchildren prior to that, though she stated that the agency staff had Relative A’s\ncontact information throughout the case. Supervisor 1 reported that the first two\nworkers who were assigned the case are no longer working for the agency and were\nboth terminated due to issues related to their work performance, so she was not\nsurprised that they did not complete the required relative search and engagement\ndocumentation. When asked if Relative A was assessed for placement at any time\nprior to April of 2020, Supervisor 1 stated that Relative A did not reach out to the\nagency to request placement until November of 2019 and she was not aware if any\nof the assigned foster care workers reached out to Relative A to ask if she wanted to\nbe considered for placement.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-03 B RELATIVE ENGAGEMENT AND PLACEMENT\nIf a child must be removed from his/her home, preference must be\ngiven to placement with a relative. Due diligence must be\nexercised to identify and provide notice to all adult relatives that a\nrelated child is in foster care. Ongoing efforts to identify, locate,\nand engage relatives is an expected part of case planning and\npermanency.\nRelative Search Forms\nDHS-991, Diligent Search Checklist- is a tool that must be used in\nthe search for relatives.\nDHS-987, Relative Documentation- is a mandatory form used to\ndocument the name, address, telephone number, results of\nAmerican Indian heritage inquiry, and relationship of every relative\nidentified. Caseworkers must document all relative search contacts\non the DHS-987, Relative Documentation.\nSubsequent or Planned Placements\nCaseworkers must complete a Relative Placement Safety Screen\nfor all adult relatives who express an interest in placement, within\nfive business days of the relative's written request for placement\nconsideration.\nDenied Placement Recommendation\nIf the placement recommendation on the Relative Placement\nSafety Screen is denied, then a DHS-31, Foster Care Placement\nDecision Notice, is required to be provided to the relative with a\ncopy of the Safety Screen, within five business days of the\ndenial\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: There is no available documentation to indicate that due\ndiligence was exercised to assess Relative A for placement of her\ngrandchildren prior to them being placed in an unrelated foster\nhome or at any time throughout the case. There is no available\ndocumentation to indicate that the agency made diligent efforts to\nengage Relative A prior to Relative A requesting visitation with the\nchildren, despite the agency staff having Relative A’s contact\ninformation throughout the case.\nThe only available DHS-991 and DHS-987 forms did not include\nRelative A’s information.\nA Relative Placement Safety Screen was not completed timely as it\nwas finalized 4/8/2020 despite the assigned worker forwarding a\nreferral form to the licensing department on 1/15/2020.\nThere is no documentation indicating that a DHS-31, Foster Care\nPlacement Decision Notice was provided to the relative with a copy\nof the Safety Screen. A letter of denial and a copy of the Relative\nPlacement Safety Screen was mailed to Relative A on 5/19/2020,\nwhich is outside of the requirement to notify the relative within five\nbusiness days of the denial.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend no change to the license of this child placing agency upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan.\nJanuary 8, 2021\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 12, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
