Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 were right at\nthe doorway with Youth A when he was refusing to walk.\nSupervisor 1 reported CPI does not address how staff are to exit a\nbedroom safely. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A was threatening\nto fight staff and making statements he was “going to beat their\nass” and “kill them”. Nursing was called to come assess Youth A\nhowever Youth A refused and so the Sheriff’s Department\ntransported Youth A to the hospital.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via telephone on 11/22/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 2 responded to\nthe code 2 that was called. Upon entering the unit, Staff 1 was on\nYouth A’s right side and Staff 2 was on Youth A’s left side.\nSupervisor 2 reported there were other staff present however he\ndid not recall who. Staff 1 and Staff 2 were coaching Youth A and\ntrying to get Youth A to walk down the hall. Youth A was refusing\nto move. Supervisor 2 stood in front of Youth A to get his\nattention and asked him what was going on. Youth A told\nSupervisor 2 he wanted his cereal bar snack. Supervisor 2 was\nunsure if there were other issues going on however told Youth A,\nhe would get him his cereal bar and encouraged Youth A to walk\ndown the hall. Youth A said “no” and smiled and turned his body\naway. Staff 1 and Staff 2 were continuing to try to get Youth A to\nwalk down the hall to his chair. Supervisor 2 reported there were\na lot of staff present and a lot of people talking. Supervisor 2\ncontinued to tell Youth A he would get him a cereal bar and to\nfollow directions. Staff 1 and Staff 2 attempted to guide Youth A\nto walk down the hall as Staff 1 was patting Youth A’s back and\nStaff 2 had one hand on Youth A’s wrist and his other hand on\nYouth A’s back. Youth A continued to refuse to move down the\nhall and told staff to stop touching him. Staff 1 and Staff 2\ncontinued to try to talk to Youth A to get him to comply and walk\ndown the hall. Staff 1 and Staff 2 began to escort Youth A down\n11",
    "the hall in a CPI technique where there is a staff on each side of\nthe youth securing the youth’s arms and Supervisor 2 went behind\nYouth A so he could talk to Youth A and support him so he would\nnot fall. Youth A began resisting and was planting his feet into the\nground and tensing up his body. Staff 1 and Staff 2 continue to\nescort Youth A to the bedroom as it was close to them.\nSupervisor 2 reported several staff went into the bedroom, so he\nturned around and walked out. Supervisor 2 could only see a little\nthrough the doorway as there were staff in the bedroom with\nYouth A and it is a very small space. Staff got Youth A on to the\nbed and were attempting to place Youth A in a supine position\nhowever Youth A was resisting and pushed his legs on the floor to\nstand up. Supervisor 2 reported at times when youth are\nescalated it is difficult for staff to exit youth’s bedrooms safely.\nSupervisor 2 reported staff are taught to exit escalated youth’s\nbedrooms by one staff having the key in the door and then one by\none staff move out of the bedroom backwards. Youth are placed\nin a supine position on the bed or on the floor. Supervisor 2\nreported all situations are different and at times youth are in a\nkneeling position on the floor. Supervisor 2 did not see anything\nfurther as he moved to the side of the outside door frame as staff\nwere exiting the bedroom. Supervisor 2 heard a “thump” noise\nand thought a staff had hit their knee on the sink/toilet area last he\nsaw in the bedroom staff were near that area. Supervisor 2\nreported he never saw Youth A in a kneeling position. Supervisor\n2 reported Youth A did not hit his head while walking through the\ndoor on the door frame. Supervisor 2 reported CPI is\ncircumstantial and if a youth is in an escort and resists the escort\nand moving, CPI would say to put the youth in a lean forward\nposition and stop moving if it was a far distance however in this\nsituation Youth A was only a few feet outside the bedroom and\nstaff continued to move him as there were so close to the\nbedroom.\nProgram Supervisor was interviewed via teams on\n11/29/2023. Program Supervisor has been a CPI trainer for\ntwenty years. I reviewed the video footage with Program\nSupervisor. Program Supervisor reported the escort became a\nrestraint when Youth A was taken to the wall position. Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 were using proper CPI techniques in the escort and\nrestraint. Program Supervisor reported if he had been present,\nand Youth A was struggling/resisting he would have\nrecommended the restraint stop and Youth A be held in the\nstanding position. Program Supervisor acknowledged it is difficult\nwhen in the moment and it was not required that Staff 1 and Staff\n2 stop and hold the youth. Program Supervisor reported it did\n12",
    "appear Youth A’s head hit the door frame however it is difficult to\ntell from the angle of the camera view. Program Supervisor\nreported CPI model gives a lot of recommendations however does\nnot provide a lot of the recommendations in writing. CPI has\nprovided recommendations for exiting a bedroom when a youth is\nescalated such as using the child control position and modifying it\nto include two staff and for a youth to willingly go to their knees\nand once the youth is calm for the youth to place their hands on\nthe walls while staff exit the bedroom. Program Supervisor\nreported he has not trained staff to cross youth legs and hold\nyouth legs in the crossed position nor are youth to be forced into\nthe kneeling position. Program Supervisor reported years ago\nstaff were trained to ask youth to cross their legs and allow youth\nto do that willingly, however not for staff to hold the youth’s legs in\nthe crossed position. The only CPI hold that teaches for staff to\nhold a youth’s legs is when a youth is in a supine position and is\nkicking, which then staff are trained to hold the youth’s legs.\nProgram Manager reported at times if a youth is\nstruggling/resisting the restraint, the youth may end up in a\nkneeling position just through the natural process of the youth\nstruggling. CPI does not train any “take downs”.\nAdministrator/Complainant was interviewed via telephone on\n11/29/2023 and did not have any further concerns.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• MDHHS Incident Report 167050213: Youth A was refusing\nto follow staff directives; attempts were made to verbally\nde-escalate Youth A and get Youth A to walk to his\nbedroom. Youth A refused and continued to escalate at\nwhich time he began pushing and pulling his arms and was\nplaced in a CPI secure transport position and escorted to\nthe nearest bedroom.

To gain a high level of restriction, staff should\napply all the principles ensuring they remain as close as\npossible. If the youth is presenting with a high-risk\nbehavior, then staff have to ensure that they are as\nrestrictive as needed in order to minimize harm. Staff\nshould consider how to move/transport the youth.\n• Crisis Prevention Nonverbal Communication Haptics is\ncommunication through touch. Example of haptics is\nplacing your hand on the youth’s shoulder and maintaining\na light pressure and observing the youth’s nonverbal\nbehavior or holding the youth’s wrist and gently beginning\nto increase the pressure of the grip until you notice\nnonverbal signs of discomfort. The aim of haptics is not to\nhurt the youth but to demonstrate the impact of touch.\n• Oakland County Children’s Village Emergency Restraint\nPolicy states emergency restraint shall be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the\nseverity of the minor child’s behavior, chronical and\ndevelopmental age, size, gender, physical condition,\nmedical condition, psychiatric condition, and personal\nhistory including any history of trauma, and done in a\nmanner consistent with the resident’s treatment plan.\n• Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4’s personnel file.
