INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nDescription service policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(d) Storage of medications.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Medication is not being stored properly, allowing a youth to break\nin and take it in an attempt to overdose.\nInvestigation The Complainant was interviewed on 01/24/2024 and did not\nprovide any additional information.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed on 01/24/2024 during a\npreviously announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He showed\nmounted first aid kits throughout the facility, which were metal\nboxes with dual clasped doors on them. The Chief Administrator\nalso showed where each incident had occurred that involved\nYouth A ingesting Tylenol during escalated incidents. He\nconfirmed he did not witness the parts of the incidents where\nYouth A was able to obtain over-the-counter medication and\ningest it, but he was present for other parts of the incidents. The\nfirst instance occurred inside of the clinical area of the facility. The\nentrance to the clinical area is locked, and within it is a seating\narea and then a hallway with offices for therapists and nurses. At\nthe end of the hallway there was a metal first aid kit box mounted\non the wall. At the time of this visit that first aid kit was secured by\nzip ties. When opened, there were only a few items of gauze and\nmedical tape located within. The Chief Administrator showed a\nseparate locked closet within this suite that contained over-the-\ncounter medications and treatments at that time. The second\ninstance of Youth A getting access to Tylenol occurred in multiple\nareas of the facility. It started near the entrance of a gym and the\nadjoining hallway, where there is another wall mounted first aid kit.\nThis was the one location where Youth A allegedly obtained over-\nthe-counter medication during this incident. The Chief\nAdministrator stated Youth A was then brought to a classroom\nlocated outside of his unit for further supervision.\n2",
    "Youth A was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 02/21/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He\nconfirmed there had been two separate occasions where he had\nbeen able to get over-the counter medication in his possession.\nDuring the first incident, Youth A stated he was in the clinical area\nof the facility. Youth A recalled Case Manager 1 and Therapist 1\nwere present and trying to de-escalate him as he was getting\nincreasingly upset. Youth A stated he was “playing games with\nthem” as he ran around the clinical office area. Youth A\neventually went up to a metal boxed first aid kit mounted on the\nwall and opened it. He stated this was not locked at the time.\nYouth A recalled taking a box of individually packaged Tylenol and\ngrabbing a handful of them and then ran away from staff. Youth A\nrecalled trying to rip a bunch of the packs open and take the\nmedication. He initially stated he had taken 30 pills, but further in\nthe interview he stated it was probably more like ten. Youth A\nstated he was quickly taken to the hospital after this occurred for\nmedical attention. He could not specifically recall when this\noccurred. Youth A recalled a separate incident where he was able\nto do the same thing a few weeks later. He stated he was in a\nhallway of the facility and was getting mad when he attempted to\ndo the same thing as a few weeks prior. Youth A recalled finding\nanother wall mounted first aid kit and this time it was secured with\nzip ties. He stated he was able to break this kit open through the\nzip ties before any staff were able to approach him. Youth A then\nrecalled he turned the lights off in the hallway as he did this,\ngrabbed more individual Tylenol packets, and then put them in his\npants pocket. Youth A stated he then went into the gym and tried\nto take the pills while drinking some Gatorade he had in his\npocket. He recalled a staff member being right there with him and\ntrying to stop him. Youth A also recalled this indeterminate staff\nmember stating “It’s not gonna do nothing” because Youth A took\nthree to five pills. Youth A recalled other staff, that he could not\nremember, escorting him to a nearby classroom, and he was\ntransported to the hospital for medical attention not long after that.\nYouth A stated he attempted to open and ingest some staples that\nwere in a teacher’s desk in that classroom. Youth A believed no\nother youth witnessed either incident because he was the only\nyouth in the clinical area during the first incident and he had been\nwandering the hallways with staff following him during the second\ninstance.\nNurse 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 02/21/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She\nrecalled being a part of both incidents with Youth A. Nurse 1\n3",
    "stated she did not see Youth A ingest the Tylenol during the first\nincident, but she did see the wrappers from what Youth A had\ngrabbed on the floor when she entered the clinical area. Nurse 1\nrecalled Case Manager 1 and Staff 1 were present. Nurse 1\nstated Staff 1 performed the Heimlich maneuver on Youth A and\nthis was successful. Nurse 1 stated she then quickly arranged for\nYouth A to be taken to the hospital. Nurse 1 also recalled being a\npart of the second incident in a similar manner, reporting to the\nclassroom where Youth A was after he had taken the Tylenol.\nShe recalled several other staff present that she could not name.\nNurse 1 recalled seeing Youth A attempt to ingest staples only for\nstaff members to get the staples out of his hand to prevent this.\nNurse 1 stated 911 was called and Youth A was quickly taken to\nthe hospital.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 02/21/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled\nbeing involved with the first incident of Youth A ingesting Tylenol.\nHe stated he was in the clinical area with Youth A and that Youth\nA had been struggling emotionally for about an hour. Staff 1\nstated he was within arm’s reach of Youth A when Youth A\nopened a wall mounted first aid kit and appeared to grab anything\nthat was inside of it. Staff 1 recalled Youth A having a handful of\nindividually wrapped Tylenol packets. Staff 1 stated he was trying\nto verbally de-escalate Youth A and grab the packets from him\nwhen Youth A quickly ripped some open and dumped some of the\npills in his mouth. Staff 1 recalled immediately performing the\nHeimlich maneuver and this was successful as several pills came\nout of Youth A’s mouth. Staff 1 was not sure if Youth A swallowed\nany of the pills. Staff 1 believed he was the assigned 1:1 staff for\nYouth A at that time. He confirmed he never lost line of sight for\nYouth A and he stated he was engaged with him during the entire\nincident.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 02/21/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. He stated\nhe was a part of the second incident of Youth A taking Tylenol in\nan unapproved manner. He saw Youth A come out of the gym\ninto the hallway and Staff 2 witnessed him stuffing something in\nhis mouth. Staff 2 stated he was close enough to Youth A to pick\nsome of the pills out of his mouth before any could be swallowed.\nStaff 2 also recalled Youth A spitting some of the pills out of his\nmouth. He stated he was not certain what Youth A ingested other\nthan recognizing them as pills in individual wrappers, but that is\nwhat prompted him to attempt to get them out of Youth A’s mouth.\nStaff 2 believed this occurred near the mounted first aid kit on the\n4",
    "wall. Staff 2 had not seen Youth A break in to this but assumed\nthat was what occurred because it had been broken open.\nNurse 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 02/21/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated\nthat she was involved in the first instance of Youth A ingesting\nTylenol, but she did not witness him doing so. Nurse 2 recalled\nYouth A was escalated to the point of attempting to grab and\ningest almost anything he could get his hands on within the clinical\narea, including examination gloves and post-it notes.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 02/21/2024\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She stated\nshe witnessed Youth A in the classroom after he attempted to\ningest Tylenol during that second instance. Therapist 1 recalled\napproximately five staff members in the room with her and Youth\nA but could not recall exactly who those staff were. She\nattempted to speak with Youth A but he was not very responsive\nat that moment. Therapist 1 recalled attempted restraints\noccurring because Youth A was trying to grab anything he could,\nincluding staples from a teacher’s desk, to ingest. Therapist 1 did\nnot see staples get ingested and was not sure if Youth A was able\nto do so. Therapist 1 stated she was with Youth A until he was\ntransported to the hospital.\nCase Manager 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on\n02/21/2024 during an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility.\nShe recalled being present for both instances of Youth A ingesting\nTylenol. For the first incident she recalled being in the clinical\narea with Staff 1 and Youth A as they were conversing with him.\nYouth A became more and more escalated, and Case Manager 1\nsaw him go past Staff 1 and up to a wall mounted first aid kit.\nCase Manager 1 saw Youth A open this first aid kit and noted that\nit was not locked in any form. She recalled Youth A grabbing\nwhatever he could and doing so quickly, including Tylenol\npackets. Case Manager 1 recalled Youth A then running past\nboth staff members back down the same hallway where they were\nstanding and as he did so he put several of the packets in his\nmouth. Case Manager 1 was not sure how many pills Youth A\ningested. She recalled telling Staff 1 to do the Heimlich maneuver\nand he did, with it resulting in Youth A regurgitating several pills.\nCase Manager 1 recalled Youth A quickly de-escalating at that\npoint and then being transported to the hospital for further\nattention. Case Manager 1 then recalled the second incident\nwhere Youth A ingested Tylenol. She stated she was not in front\nof Youth A when he first ingested Tylenol, but she did see pills in\n5",
    "his mouth as he turned around. She believed Staff 3 was the staff\nmember that was providing the closest supervision of Youth A at\nthat point in time. Case Manager 1 recalled telling Staff 3 to\nperform the Heimlich maneuver and he did, but it was not as\nsuccessful as the first instance in that they believed Youth A\nswallowed some of the pills. Case Manager 1 recalled Youth A\nthen calming down and eventually going to the hospital.\nThe facility was toured with the Chief Administrator on\n02/21/2024. Each wall mounted first aid kit was viewed and it was\nconfirmed they were empty and not of use anymore. The Chief\nAdministrator showed a new setup where a locked closet inside of\nthe locked clinical area was being utilized for the storage of all\nover-the counter medications and other related first aid and topical\ncare items.\nStaff 3 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 over the phone on\n02/23/2024. He stated he was involved in both situations where\nYouth A took Tylenol. Staff 3 clarified that he only met with other\nstaff after the first instance where Youth A took Tylenol. When\nStaff 3 came into the clinical office he recalled Youth A stating,\n“I’ve been taking medicine” and also stating that he was starting to\nfeel dizzy. Staff 3 recalled Nurse 1, Case Manager 1 and\nTherapist 1 being present already. Staff 3 stated he accompanied\nYouth A to the hospital without incident, and he was able to get\nattention and be released quickly. Staff 3 stated he was also\ninvolved in the second incident, but again after Youth A ingested\nTylenol. Staff 3 recalled attempting to put Youth A in a standing\nhold restraint as Youth A was trying to ingest either staples or an\nexamination glove, but he did not need to complete the restraint\nhold as Youth A dropped the item.\nDuring a phone call held on 04/05/2024 DHHS Worker 1 stated\nthey would not have findings resulting from their investigation.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Incident reports (IR) for both instances involving Youth A\nwere provided:\no The first incident was dated 01/16/2024 and the IR\nprovides details consistent with interviews of youth\nand staff.\no The second incident was dated 02/05/2024 and the\nIR provides details consistent with interviews of\nyouth and staff.\n• Video footage was provided, but in both cases the footage\nproved to be inconclusive to the events that occurred. On\n6",
    "02/27/2024 the Chief Administrator stated that the video\nfootage inside of the clinical area during the first incident\nwas not able to be located due to a technical issue. Two\ncamera angles containing video footage of the second\nincident on 02/05/2024 were provided. The first is\nobscured, and the second does not provide a clear view of\nYouth A in the hallway as he took the medication from the\nfirst aid kit.\n• Facility policy and procedures were reviewed and of note\nwas the section titled \"Medication Administration and\nPharmaceuticals.\" This policy had a section specific to\nover the counter medications in which it was described that\nthose medications \"are stored in the Medical Clinic either in\na locked cabinet, locked refrigerator, or locked\npharmaceutical cart, behind a locked door.\"\n• Safety plans authored by the facility for Youth A were\nprovided. Upon his return to the program on 02/01/2024 it\nwas planned that Youth A had restrictions on his clothing\nand be provided one-on-one supervision.\no In addition, documentation was provided that\nshowed coverage of one-on-one supervision from\nthis date onwards, including the date of 02/05/2024\nwhen the second incident occurred.\n• Medical documentation from the Detroit Medical Center\nwas provided and no additional concerns other than proper\nmental health treatment and safety planning for Youth A in\nthe facility’s programming.\nAnalysis Through on-site inspections, interviews with youth and staff and\ndocumentation reviewed there was evidence found to support a\nrule violation regarding the facility not following their own policy on\nthe storage of medications.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• Prompt, complete and organized responses to\ndocumentation requests for investigations is required\nand the facility is advised to consider procedures to\nallow for this to occur easily.\n• Consideration should be given to common classroom\nand office items such as loose staples that could easily\nbe used for self-harm by an escalated youth.\nConclusion Violation Established\n7",
