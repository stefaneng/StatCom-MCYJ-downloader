A\nvariance for this placement was request 6/15/22 and denied 6/16/22. There are\nconcerns at this facility regarding their ability to care for youth with significant needs.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 6/29/2022 I was assigned to investigate an allegation made by Complainant that\na youth was placed at an adult foster care (AFC) home despite there being a denied\nvariance in place. The Complainant reported that there was an investigation at the\nAFC home, which didn’t involve this youth, but revealed that this youth was placed\nwithout the required approval.\n2",
    "INTERVIEWS\nProgram Manager – On 7/1/2022 I interviewed Program Manager at the agency.\nProgram Manager reported the agency currently has three high needs youth for\nwhom they have had difficulty finding and maintaining placement. She reported\nYouth A has been in several placements and was AWOL out of state for some time\nbefore being located in Wisconsin then brought to northern Michigan. While in\nnorthern Michigan, Youth A spent a night at a DHHS office before the St. Joseph\nDHHS staff could get there to bring her back to their office. An independent living\n(IL) provider was located for Youth A where she was placed; however, that IL\nprovider requested Youth A be moved. The staff, supervisors and Program Manager\nsearched for placements and located the administrator of an AFC home where they\nhad previously placed youth who stated that he had purchased a home for IL youth\nand that it would be ready for placement the following Monday or Tuesday. Foster\nCare Worker drove Youth A to Flint, where the IL home was located once it was\nreportedly ready but called the agency once they arrived stating that the home was\nnot appropriate as there was no running water, no refrigerator, and it was under\nconstruction. Foster Care Worker was not comfortable leaving the youth there and\nsent pictures to the supervisors and Program Manager who determined that the\nyouth could not stay. The decision was made to direct Foster Care Worker to bring\nYouth A to the administrator’s AFC home in Lansing, which did not have any other\nresidents placed. A variance was subsequently requested but denied due to ongoing\ninvestigations regarding the youth who was previously placed in the home. Program\nManager reported they continue to work with the Business Service Center (BSC)\nand providers to locate appropriate placement for Youth A but continue to receive\ndenials or lack of response. Program Manager added they are experiencing a lack of\nplacement options, particularly in crisis situation, and they made the decision to\nplace the youth at the AFC home due to a lack of options.\nFoster Care Supervisor – On 7/7/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Supervisor\nvirtually via Microsoft Teams. Foster Care Supervisor reiterated many of the same\nconcerns as Program Manager regarding lack of placement resources, particularly\nfor three youth who the agency is currently assigned. She reported Youth A’s\nplacement at the AFC home was an emergency placement made after Foster Care\nWorker brought Youth A to a home alleged to have been ready for IL youth. When\nFoster Care Worker arrived, the home was not appropriate, so she brought Youth A\nto the AFC home. Foster Care Supervisor stated that to her knowledge, there were\nno other residents at the home. She stated the AFC home provided 1 to 1 staffing for\nYouth A. Foster Care Supervisor stated agency staff have consistently been working\nwith the BSC and local team to locate an approved placement for Youth A. She\nreported Youth A moved from the AFC home on 7/7/2022 to a home licensed\nthrough a contracted agency. This placement was intended to be an IL placement,\nbut the foster mother is now stating she would like it to be a foster care placement,\nwhich is what they are working on today.\nFoster Care Worker – On 7/7/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker virtually via\nMicrosoft Teams. Foster Care Worker reported the agency currently has three high\n3",
    "needs youth, one of whom is currently at the office. She stated Youth A’s placement\nat the AFC home was due to placement crisis, not to due to a lack of efforts. She\nstated Youth A returned from being AWOL on a Thursday night and a co-worker\npicked up Youth A and brought her back to the office the following day. Foster Care\nWorker stated Youth A was triggered by being at the office with memories of being\nthere and visiting with her mother. She stated they were able to locate an IL provider\nin Sturgis which is where they placed Youth A that same day. She stated that she\nwasn’t there long before that provider gave notice to have Youth A moved. Foster\nCare Worker stated “everyone” made many attempts to locate placement but\nreceived either denials or lack of response. She stated the denials are either related\nto Youth A’s needs and behaviors, or the facilities not having openings. She stated\nthere was a home in Flint that was supposed to be ready for placements on\n6/13/2022, so Foster Care Worker and a co-worker brought Youth A to the home on\nthat date. When she arrived at the home, the home was under construction and did\nnot have running water. She stated contrary to the owner’s previous reports, the\nhome had been either purchased or leased just that day. She stated she and the co-\nworker left the home and drove around the block to call their supervisors and report\nthe home’s conditions. She stated the supervisors and Program Manager met then\ncalled Foster Care Worker and asked her to take pictures of the home and send\nthem back, which she did. Once the supervision team reviewed the photos, they\ndirected Foster Care Worker to not leave the youth at the home. The owner of the\nhome stated he had another IL home nearby, so Foster Care Worker brought Youth\nA there. Foster Care Worker stated she didn’t even go into the home because it was\nnot appropriate due to it being all males in the home. The owner of the home then\nstated they could bring Youth A to his AFC home in Lansing. She stated when they\narrived at the home, the only other resident was being taken to the hospital by\nambulance and Foster Care Worker does not know if that resident was returned to\nthe home. She stated the home provided 1 to 1 staffing for Youth A 24/7. She\nreported the worker at the home was great and helpful in assisting with Youth A\nparticipating in potential placement interviews. Foster Care Worker reported a\nvariance was denied for this placement, and she continued to work diligently on\nfinding an approved placement. She stated that they were trying to do what was best\nfor Youth A in the moment, by providing the safest place for her to be with what was\navailable. Foster Care Worker stated Youth A moved to a foster home on July 5,\n2022. She stated that the foster mother called her this morning and was reporting\n“many concerns.” Foster Care Worker stated she has already sent out 2 more\npackets to IL providers as she is concerned this placement won’t last.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nVariance – I reviewed a variance request completed by Foster Care Worker and\nFoster Care Supervisor on 6/15/2022, which was denied on 6/15/2022.\nPlacement Records – I reviewed the placement record of Youth A which\ndocuments 25 placements including licensed foster homes, child caring institutions,\n4",
    "hospitals, DHHS offices, and IL placement. Additionally, Youth A has been AWOL\non 5 occasions.\nCase Contacts – I reviewed the case contacts in Youth A’s file beginning 6/13/2022\nand located 21 calls to placement providers documented.\nPhotos – I viewed photos of the IL home in Flint which showed a home with bare\nwires, uncovered electrical outlets, exposed piping, exposed carpet tacks from\ncarpet being removed, and areas of what appeared to be mildew and water damage.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12404 Placement.\n(1) An agency shall only place a child with an adult who\nis legally related to the child, is a legal custodian, or\nin a licensed foster home, except as permitted in R\n400.12709.\nANALYSIS: The agency staff placed Youth A in an AFC home on 6/13/2022.\nThey requested a variance approval for the placement on\n6/15/2022 and it was denied on 6/15/2022. Youth A remained in\nthe placement until 7/5/2022.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend no change in the\nlicense status.\nJuly 7, 2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 8, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
