Video shows Youth A wrap her leg around\nSupervisor’s leg causing them to fall in the hallway.

Youth A is laying on her back\ntrying to kick, wiggling around on the floor, punching the air with\nher arms and screaming. The video shows Staff 1 holding Youth\nA’s legs as she is continuing to kick and Staff 2 is up by Youth\nA’s head. It is unclear if Staff 2 is successfully holding either of\nYouth A’s arms.
