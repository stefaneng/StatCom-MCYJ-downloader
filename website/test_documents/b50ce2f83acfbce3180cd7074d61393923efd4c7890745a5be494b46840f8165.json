She stated could not recall why\nshe was initially upset, but noted Chief Administrator was “mean”\nto her and in response she wanted to “mess up” the staff office of\nthe facility. While in the staff only office, Youth A recalled\ngrabbing papers and throwing them to the ground and causing\ngeneral disarray on purpose. After doing so, Youth A recalled\nhearing the Chief Administrator state “Oh no, you’re not going to\ndo that.” Youth A recalled Chief Administrator stating she was\ngoing to pick up the paperwork on the ground and Youth A\nintentionally stepped on them and told her “No, you’re not picking\nthose up, those are mine.” Youth A stated she used profane\nlanguage towards Chief Administrator while she was angry, but\nChief Administrator did not say anything profane or inappropriate\nback to Youth A. With that said, Youth A stated that Chief\nAdministrator mouthed words to Youth A but did not audibly say\nthem, including “Your Dad is a cunt and your Mom is a ho.” Youth\nA stated Chief Administrator touched her arm because she was\ntrying to get back to the office again after initially leaving. Youth A\nclosed the sliding door to the office and Chief Administrator put\nher hands on it also to keep it closed. Youth A stated the door fell\noff the track above the top of the door and she believed it had\nbroken.

    "Chief Administrator leaving the office area after that. Youth A\ngrabbed the visitor log from the front entrance area of the building.\nYouth A was yelling and upset at that point, and could not recall\nexactly what she said to Chief Administrator. Youth A stated Chief\nAdministrator grabbed the visitor log from Youth A, which only\nmade her more upset. After that all Youth A could recall was that\nlaw enforcement came to the home and she didn't interact much\nwith Chief Administrator. Youth A believed there were no other\nyouth present during the entirety of this incident because the other\nstaff member working had made sure they were all staying\nupstairs while Chief Administrator was with Youth A. On a\nseparate, previous occasion Youth A stated Chief Administrator\nhad used her hand to mock Youth A and make it look like her\nhand was talking while Youth A was, insinuating that Chief\nAdministrator was not paying attention to Youth A. Youth A\nbelieved Youth B witnessed this on one occasion but thought that\nno one else ever would have because Chief Administrator was\n“sneaky” when she did it. Youth A clarified Chief Administrator\nnever did things like this in front of anyone or out loud.\nChief Administrator was interviewed during an announced, face\nto face visit at the facility on 10/26/2023. Chief Administrator\nrecalled Youth A was upset that afternoon. She recalled Youth A\ninitially escalated around dinner.

Chief\nAdministrator recalled she and Staff 1 attempted to get the book\nfrom Youth A and Chief Administrator was able to do so without\nphysical contact or incident. Chief Administrator recalled Youth A\nstating she was hit by Chief Administrator in doing so, but Chief\nAdministrator denied this occurred. Chief Administrator recalled\nYouth A went into the staff office. Chief Administrator asked her\nnot to go in there because it was for staff only. Youth A attempted\nto force her way into the sliding door. Chief Administrator was\nstanding next to her when Youth A slid the door open with too\nmuch force and it came off the top track. Chief Administrator\nstated her hands were not on the door at that point. She recalled\nsaying to Youth A “You’re damaging property and other kids have\nhad to leave because of that” as well as “I have to call law\nenforcement now.” Chief Administrator recalled Youth A was\nstating that she did not break the door, but t Chief Administrator\ndid, but Chief Administrator denied this was possible because she\ndidn’t have her hands on the door last. Youth A threw papers\naround and tore them up, all from the office area. Chief\nAdministrator stated Youth A began to scream about “Give me my\nfucking grievance,” to which Chief Administrator stated she would\n4",
    "when Youth A left the staff only office area and sat at the table to\ncalmly write out her grievance. Chief Administrator recalled Youth\nA yelled back that she would not and moved to a different part of\nthe residence. Chief Administrator stated law enforcement was\ncalled and they made it to the home shortly afterwards to continue\ninteraction with Youth A as she was escalated and threatened the\nChief Administrator. Chief Administrator stated there was no point\nin time that she mouthed any inappropriate comments to Youth A\nduring this incident or on any other occasions. She also denied\nmocking Youth A in any other manner. Chief Administrator stated\nthe only time she can recall whispering to Youth A was on a day\nthat she was at school with Youth A and she whispered to her that\nshe needed to leave school and go back to the facility, but would\nbe back to pick her up for the day later as normal.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 11/02/2023 over the phone. She\nstated she was working with Chief Administrator the evening of\nthe incident. Staff 1 believed Youth A initially was upset because\nshe wanted to call her worker but it was the weekend and they\nhad told her that her worker wouldn’t be working to pick up the\nphone. Staff 1 recalled Youth A yelling and cussing at her and\nChief Administrator but could not recall any specific statements.\nStaff 1 stated Youth A eventually grabbed the visitor log book and\nwas threatening and trying to tear it up. Staff 1 believed Chief\nAdministrator was able to take the log book from Youth A without\nincident. Staff 1 recalled Youth A going into the staff only office\narea and throwing paperwork and files all over the floor. Staff 1\nstated she did not see more of this part of the incident because\nshe was back in the kitchen to finish making dinner. Staff 1 stated\nshe did not see how the door to the office was broken. She did\nrecall hearing Chief Administrator state law enforcement had to be\ncalled because of the broken property, and Youth A denied\nbreaking the door. Staff 1 stated she did not interact with Youth A\nmuch after that point because law enforcement came and they\nessentially took over interacting with Youth A. Staff 1 denied ever\nhearing Chief Administrator do anything similar to mouthing\ninappropriate comments to Youth A or mocking her in any form.\nAttempts were made to have contact with Youth B at her\nplacement at a new facility on 10/18/2023, 10/23/2023,\n10/24/2023, 10/26/2023 and 10/27/2023 with no success because\nshe declined to interview with DCWL.\nYouth C, Youth D, Youth E were interviewed separately during\nan announced, face-to-face visit to the facility on 11/09/2023.\nNone of the youth had first had knowledge of the incident in\n5",
    "question because it was before their time placed at the program.\nAll three youth stated they had not specifically witnessed Chief\nAdministrator do something like mouthing words to Youth A or any\nother youth. They did not have any specific instances where it felt\nChief Administrator mocked them. Youth C noted there was a\nrecent instance where she felt strongly Chief Administrator was\ngoing out of her way to accuse Youth C of not showering when\nshe had just left the bathroom from using the shower and did not\nunderstand where the logic could have been to cause those\ncomments. Youth D stated she heard Chief Administrator say to\nherself “This is why I’m not coming back here” on one recent\noccasion.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• An incident report dated 09/24/2023 authored by Staff 1\nwas received and reviewed. Starting at 3:45 on 09/24/2023\nYouth A began to escalate because she wanted to call her\nprobation officer and was not able to because it was the\nweekend. Youth A was described as screaming because\nshe believed could call her caseworkers at any time, and\nthen proceeded to attempt to rip up the visitor’s log. Once\nthe log book was taken from her, Youth A then went into\nthe staff-only office area and refused to leave. The incident\nreport stated that Youth A attempted to tear up papers in\nthat office and eventually “messed up” the door to the\noffice. It was documented that law enforcement was then\ncalled and they came to the residence and proceeded to\ninteract with Youth A. It was documented that Youth A\nescalated further with law enforcement, who made the\ndecision to have her transported to the local hospital for\nmedical attention.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff, there was no evidence\nfound to show that Youth A was ridiculed or derogatory language\nwas used towards her by Chief Administrator.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility should trained staff quickly on de-escalation\ntechniques and healthy interactions with youth. While there\nwas not evidence found that would produce a rule violation,\ninterviews with each youth placed at the program produced\nexamples of concerning behavior between staff and youth.\nStaff appear to be struggling with power/control with youth\nwhen not necessary. Staff are quick to utilize or reference\ncontacting law enforcement during situations that, with\ndifferent training or approaches from staff, may not require\n6",
    "it and may only be triggering youth escalating the situation.\nBehavior management policies and house rules should be\nanalyzed and re-considered.\nConsultation provided:\n• Grievance forms should be available to youth regardless of\ntheir current state and allow them to access that option at\nany time, this may be a way to help them de-escalate in\nand of itself.\n• If the facility is going to use the current room as a staff only\noffice area it was advised the sliding door to this room have\na lock be placed on it to prevent access from youth.\n• The facility utilizes security cameras but the area where the\ndining room enters into the staff only office cannot be\nviewed. It was advised the program explore how to capture\nthis area as well as any other difficult to see areas of the\nbuilding.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n11/16/2023\n__________________________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 17, 2023\n__________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
