Compliance\n10/08/2021 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION:\nOn 9/28/21, youth was sexually assaulted in the bathroom at school by a classmate.\nYouth disclosed limited information to staff at facility on 9/28/21. Staff said that they\nwould fill out a report but did not go further as the incident was reported as\nharassment initially.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed the DHHS Case Manager by phone on 10/5/21. She reported not\nbeing aware of the allegations but plans on contacting Youth A and visiting the\nfacility as soon as possible. She also reported Youth A has a history of experiencing\nsexual abuse.\nI left a phone message for the complainant on 10/5/21.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 and Administrator 2 at the facility on 10/6/21.\nThey reported having awareness of the allegations and reported that the incident\nwas not “called in” until Youth A gave “full disclosure” on 10/4/21. They reported\nYouth A gave several different accounts of the incident to different staff.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 10/6/21. Youth A reported telling\nSupervisor 1 on 10/1/21 but reported “I didn’t tell him the whole story”. Youth A also\nreported telling Staff 1 on 10/2/21 and telling “more than I told Supervisor 1”. Youth\nA reported telling no other staff except these two staff.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 by phone on 10/6/21. He reported not suspecting\nabuse because “Youth A told me nothing happened in the bathroom”. He also\nreported Youth A told him another student took Youth A’s backpack and went into\nthe boy’s restroom. He reported informing the Clinical Supervisor and Case Manager\n1. He also reported Case Manager 1 informed him that she was in communication\nwith the school about the incident. He reported not making a report to the police or\nDHHS because “I didn’t have more information that led to abuse” but he did\ncomplete a Critical Incident Report (CIR). He reported if hearing about an attempted\nrape he would have reported the information to DHHS and the police.\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 by phone on 10/6/21. She reported being told by Youth A on\n10/2/21 that “a male peer at school tried to rape Youth A”. She also reported\ncompleting a CIR and informing Supervisor 2 of the information provided. Staff 1\nreported asking Youth A if she informed anyone else and having Youth A state, “I\ntold Supervisor 1 earlier”. She reported Supervisor 2 told her to write a new CIR\nbecause of new information and she never read the other CIRs, so she didn’t know\nwhat Youth A had told to Supervisor 1. She ended when she reported Supervisor 2\ninformed her “the incident had already been reported”.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone on 10/6/21. She reported being told by Youth C\nabout an incident in school involving Youth A and a male student on 9/28/21. She\nalso reported being told that Youth A provided oral sex to the male student but being\ntold nothing more. She reported writing a CIR and informing Supervisor 3 of the\ninformation. She reported if a youth reported they were raped she would have called\nin the report and contacted the police.\nI interviewed Staff 3 by phone on 10/6/21. He reported being told by Youth A on\n9/28/21 that Youth A did not engage in oral sex with a male student at the school.\nHe stated, “Youth A was very adamant that it didn’t occur”. He also reported he\nwould follow procedures and report the incident if Youth A said she had been\nabused.\nI interviewed Case Manager 1 by phone on 10/6/21. She reported being aware of\na male student asking Youth A for a sexual favor but was unable to identify how she\nwas informed of this situation. She also reported contacting the school for additional\ninformation and provided the school report. She reported “never hearing about an\nassault until after the report by Youth A, at which time she contacted the DHHS\nCase Manager. She also reported not making a formal report because she “didn’t\nsuspect abuse, only had secondhand information”, and “normally we don’t do a 3200\nfor kid-on-kid sexual activity”.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone on 10/6/21. He reported being informed of\nthe attempted rape on 10/2/21 by Staff 1. He also reported telling Staff 1 “it has been\npreviously reported to Supervisor 1 and Case Manager “. He reported knowing this\nbecause of the documentation on the other CIRs that were provided. He also\nreported he should have followed up with Youth A and “made a report”. He reported\n“there were other things going on and I didn’t have a chance to follow up before\nleaving campus at 10:00 PM”. He also reported Youth A was in bed when he left\ncampus. He reported this was a mistake and “on me”.\nI interviewed Staff 4 by phone on 10/6/21. She reported being informed by Youth\nA that a rape had occurred, so she completed a CIR. She also reported Youth A told\nher that she had “told other staff and supervisors about the incident”. She reported\nCase Manager 2 called the police after talking with Youth A the same day she found\nout from Youth A. She reported DHHS and the police should have been called when\nYouth A provided information that supported suspected abuse.\n4",
    "I interviewed Case Manager 2 by phone on 10/6/21. She reported first hearing\nabout a “rape” on 10/4/21 and calling the police the same day. She also reported\nYouth A complained that “no one is doing anything about the rape” and that this was\nthe first time she heard the term “rape” about the incident. She denied being aware\nof the CIR written on 10/2/21 that documented “attempted rape”. She reported\nknowing the process for suspected abuse and knowing what action she is to take,\nthus calling the police the same day.\nI interviewed Supervisor 3 by phone on 10/6/21. He reported learning about a\n“rape” on 10/4/21 and reviewing two other CIRs that never documented a “rape”. He\nreported the other two CIRs documented an incident with a backpack and Youth A\nwaiting to get the backpack until the male student left the bathroom. He reported if\nknowing about the CIR written on 10/2/21 he “would have called the police”.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the Critical Incident Reports (CIR) regarding the alleged incident.\nThe first CIR was dated 9/28/21 at 11 PM and completed by Staff 2. This document\nstates the following.\nYouth C came up to this staff and said that Youth B told her that Youth A told\nthem that they had sucked another students dick in the bathroom at school\nthis morning. Youth A then told Staff 3 that it wasn't true.\nThis document notes the “action taken” involved informing Supervisor 3.\nThe second CIR was dated 10/1/21 6:30 AM and completed by Supervisor 1. This\ndocument states the following.\nYouth A had a closed fist while shaking their legs under the table rapidly\nduring group therapy. Supervisor 1 noticed that something was on Youth A’s\nmind. Supervisor 1 asked Youth A if they wanted to speak in the den. Youth A\nsaid that they would like too. Once in the den, Youth A told Supervisor 1 of an\nevent at school. A junior peer was in the hallway. He asked Youth A to go into\nthe bathroom with him. Youth A didn’t want to. Then he took Youth A’s\nbackpack into the bathroom. Youth A said to the writer, \" I'm not no bitch so I\nwent into the bathroom to get it back\". Once in the bathroom Youth A’s peer\nasked for sexual favors in order to get their backpack. Youth A refused and\nleft the bathroom and went quickly to class. Later, Youth A return to the\nbathroom to get her backpack when it was safe.\nThe action taken on this document states the following.\nSupervisor 1 debrief with Youth A and thanked them for trusting him with this\ninformation. Supervisor 1 shared this information to Youth A’s case manager\n(Case Manager 1). Case Manager 1 was already in contact with the school,\n5",
    "regarding their investigation.\nThe third CIR was dated 10/2/21 8:55 PM and completed by Staff 1. This document\nstates the following.\nDuring a conversation with Staff 1, Youth A disclosed that a male peer at\nschool, \"tried to rape\" them. When Staff 1 asked for more information about\nthe incident, Youth A stated that they were in the hallway and the peer took\ntheir MP3 player without asking, then he took the MP3 player into the male\nrestroom. In order to retrieve the MP3 player, Youth A went into the male\nrestroom after the male peer, although they did not want to go in there. Youth\nA further stated that while in the bathroom, the peer elicited a sexual favor\nand attempted to take down Youth A's pants. Youth A started to cry so Staff\n1 did not push the conversation any further. Youth A reported they informed\nthe principal and Supervisor 3 on Wednesday (9-29), and Case Manager 2\nwas informed on Friday (10-1).\nThe action taken is documented, “Staff 1 shared the information with leadership on\nshift (supervisor 2). CIR was written and emailed to Residential notification group.”\nThe fourth CIR was dated 10/4/21 10:59 PM and completed by Staff 4. The\ndocument states the following.\nYouth A stated that she was raped by a boy at her school. Originally this was\nfollowed up through staff and supervisors. However, staff were given the\ninformation that Youth A was feeling uncomfortable by a boy and had not\nrealized that she had been raped. After talking with Youth A, Case Manager 2\ncalled the police. Later a follow-up call was placed to the police that Youth A\nhad stated that she was fine talking to the police in the morning but police\ncame out at night. Youth A gave her report to the police that night.”\nThe action taken is documented. “Youth A talked to police and with staff. Youth A\ngave report. CIR was written and sent to Residential notification group.”\nI reviewed the “Incident Notification Policy” for the facility. This document states the\nfollowing actions to be taken. “Incidents involving abuse of a foster child shall be\nreported as soon as possible but not more than 24 hours after the incident to:\n Children’s Protective Services\n Child’s parents/legal guardian\n Responsible agency\n Guardian ad litem as applicable”\nI reviewed HR documentation regarding Supervisor 2. There were two disciplinary\nactions taken with Supervisor 2 documented in the HR file. The first occurred on\n3/26/18 and involved “poor and improper work” resulting in a “verbal warning”. The\nincidents leading to this action involve Supervisor 2 failing to sign the medication\n6",
    "administration record on six different occasions. The second disciplinary action took\nplace on 2/4/19 and resulted in a second “verbal warning”. This incident involved\nSupervisor 2 telling a youth “you should just kill yourself”. It is documented that\nSupervisor 2 “was playing around as they often joke around like this”. It is also\ndocumented “Supervisor 2 states that he would not joke with peers like this in the\nfuture”.\nI reviewed the Job Description for Supervisors at the facility. This document is titled\n“Residential Campus-Wide Supervisor”. Within this document it is stated, “The\nsupervisor must understand safety plans and major triggers for each student and will\nprovide clear direction to these staff in crisis management situations”. Further duties\nand responsibilities state the following.\nFacilitate a culture of exceptional client care which meets or exceeds\ncontract, licensing and accreditation standards. Provide coaching and role\nmodel leadership for YDS staff including strategies that build capacity to\nrespond effectively to needs of the students. Self-starter who is able to\nidentify challenges and be self-directed in developing solutions.\nDemonstrated compatibility working in an environment that demands the\nhighest levels of collaboration, cooperation, communication, participation,\ntrust, respect, and mutual accountability and responsiveness to leadership\nsupervision.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position\nassigned.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews and written\ndocumentation do not support the allegations of staff failing to\nreport suspected abuse to child protective services. However\nSupervisor 2 did fail to provide for the safety of Youth A when he\nwas informed on 10/2/21 that Youth A reported being raped and\nfailed to follow up, notify upper management or contact law\nenforcement.\nTechnical Assistance:\nAfter reviewing the facility’s incident report policy, it was\nrecommended clarification be added to the policy regarding\nwhat is meant by abuse, and how staff should respond when a\nyouth reports they were assaulted (physical or sexually) not by a\nstaff person\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHEDREPEAT\n2021C0112018 with an approved CAP on 4/14/21\n2021C0223022 with an approved CAP on 5/3/21\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that no change be\nmade to the license of this child caring institution\n10/8/2021\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 8, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8",
