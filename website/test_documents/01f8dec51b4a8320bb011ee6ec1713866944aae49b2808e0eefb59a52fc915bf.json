    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 10/16/2022 Youth A propped open his bedroom door and Youth B stuffed her\nbed and went into Youth A’s bedroom. Staff Person 1 found Youth A and Youth B\nengaging in sexual intercourse on her third bedroom monitoring check. Incident\noccurred on Vemco unit.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant\nI spoke with Complainant on 10/18/2022. Complainant did not have additional\ninformation regarding this allegation.\nYouth A\nI interviewed Youth A on 10/18/2022 at Mott Children’s Residence with another\nDepartment of Health and Human Service worker. Youth A stated he had sexual\nintercourse with Youth B on 10/15/2022 and 10/16/2022 in his bedroom.

Youth A stated Youth B\ncame into his bedroom and left without staff knowing. Youth A stated he used a shoe\nagain on 10/16/2022 to keep his bedroom door open and Youth B went in to his\nbedroom at bedtime.

Youth A stated he has not\nparticipated in other sexual activity at Mott Children’s Residence. Youth A stated\nYouth C told staff about his sexual activity with Youth B because he refused to have\nsexual relations with Youth C.\nYouth A was asked how staff complete bedtime room checks. Youth A stated staff\nunlock the bedroom door and check on the youth.\nYouth B\nI interviewed Youth B at Mott Children’s Residence on 10/18/2022 with another\nDepartment of Health and Human Service worker. Youth B stated she gave Youth C\na note on 10/15/2022 to pass to Youth A. The note was a plan for Youth B to go into\nYouth A’s bedroom. Youth B stated she returned from an outing and Youth A said,\n“Yeah” in response to her note. Youth B stated she placed a stuffed animal with\ntowels and blankets under a blanket on her bed and placed a bonnet on the stuff\nanimal’s head to make it look like she was in bed facing the wall because she knew\nstaff performed bedtime room checks. Youth B stated Youth A left his bedroom door\ncracked open and she went to Youth A’s bedroom for an hour to an hour and a half\nand had sexual intercourse with him. Youth B stated a female staff person shined a\nlight into Youth A’s bedroom, but Youth B was hidden under a blanket lying between\nYouth A and a wall and was not seen. Youth B stated there were additional bedtime\nroom checks before she returned to her bedroom. Youth B was asked how she\nreturned to her bedroom without staff being aware.

Youth B stated\nYouth C informed Staff Person 1 that she was in Youth A’s bedroom. Youth B stated\nshe was seen at a hospital on 10/17/2022.\nYouth C\nI interviewed Youth C at Mott Children’s Residence on 10/18/2022 with another\nDepartment of Health and Human Service worker.

Staff Person 1 completed room monitoring training during new hire\norientation in 08/2022.\nAnother Department of Health and Human Service agency completed an\ninvestigation with finding.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: Youth B entered Youth A’s bedroom on 10/16/2022 during\nbedtime hours. Mott Children’s Residence policy and procedure\nstates “staff must visually see that the child is in their bed”\nduring bedtime room checks. A visual check is interpreted as\nseeing a youth’s face, or body (hand, arm, foot, leg etc.) to\nconfirm that the youth is in their bedroom. Staff Person 1 did not\nrecall if she visually confirmed Youth B was in her bedroom on\n10/16/2022.\nYouth A and Youth B stated Youth B also entered Youth A’s\nbedroom on 10/15/2022 without staff awareness. Video footage\nfor 10/15/2022 bedtime is not available and there are no incident\nreports of Youth B being in Youth A’s bedroom on 10/15/2022.\nCONSULTATION:\nStaff walk each youth to their bedroom and physically and\nsecurely close the youth’s bedroom door at bedtime. Another\noption is to have a group of youth stand by their bedroom doors\nand enter their bedroom at the same time and staff then\nphysically check that each bedroom door is securely closed.\nStaff walk to a youth’s bedroom when called or knocking on the\ndoor is heard and observe the youth exiting their bedroom.\nStaff walk a youth back to their bedroom if youth was given\npermission to exit and physically and securely close the youth’s\nbedroom door.\nStaff position themselves to face the bedroom hallway during\nbedtime hours.\nStaff check youth bedroom doors to ensure alarms are in\nworking condition and place maintenance orders if needed.\nStaff should not be in a youth’s bedroom with a youth if another\nstaff person is not directly present.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nREPEAT VIOLATION 2022C0325036\nCorrective action plan pending\n8",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval\nchecks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nANALYSIS: 10/16/2022 video tape review and bedtime room monitoring\nform does not reflect a staff person went to each bedroom to\ncheck on the status of the youth from 08:15 pm to 09:45 pm due\nto Youth A and Youth B’s sexual acting out. All youths must be\nmonitored while asleep or outside of direct staff supervision in\nintervals not exceeding fifteen minutes.\n10/15/2022 and 10/16/2022 bedtime room monitoring forms\nwere reviewed. Documented bedtime room checks exceeded\nfifteen-minute variable intervals on multiple occasions on both\ndates.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position assigned.\nANALYSIS: Another Department of Health and Human Service agency\ncompleted an investigation with finding on Staff person 1.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n9",

The investigation substantiated multiple violations, including failure to conduct required visual bed checks every 15 minutes, failure to follow bedtime supervision policies, and concerns about a staff member's qualifications.
