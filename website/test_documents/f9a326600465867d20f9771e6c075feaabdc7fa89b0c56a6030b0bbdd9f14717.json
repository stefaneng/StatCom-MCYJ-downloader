The Chief\nAdministrator was to forward contact information of various\nagency staff who could provide detailed information.\nThe agency Child Welfare Director was interviewed via\ntelephone on 0702/24. The Child Welfare Director, hereafter\nreferred to as Director, provided the following information. Foster\nYouth A was hospitalized on 06/15/24 at Corewell Lakeland\nhospital. The Director reported the agency was collaborating with\nCorewell Hospital in providing supervision of Foster Youth A while\nshe was hospitalized. The Director reported that during a June 18,\n2024, phone call with the hospital Clinical Nurse Supervisor,\nsupervision of Foster Youth A was discussed, and the Clinical\nNurse Supervisor informed Director the hospital has staff who can\nhelp with supervision of Foster Youth A.

The Director reported Chief Nurse\nstated the hospital could provide staffing supervision of Foster\nYouth A particularly since agency staff would have to drive\n2",
    "significant distances to provide supervision coverage. The Director\nadded that Chief Nurse stated the hospital could provide\nsupervision of Foster Youth A for the weekend of 06/28/24\nthrough 06/30/24.\nThe Director reported on 07/01/24 she again spoke via telephone\nwith the Chief Nurse. The Director reported that the Chief Nurse\ninformed her that Hospital Social Worker was misinformed, and a\ncomplaint should not have been made.\nThe Director reported during the hospital stay of Foster Youth A\nthe agency had been actively seeking mental health services for\nFoster Youth A as well as post hospital placement.

The\nComplainant reported after she had filed the complaint against the\nagency, she learned they had been making efforts to secure\nservices for Foster Youth A. The Complainant reported\ncommunication was not very good between the agency and the\nhospital therefore they did not know efforts for services for Foster\nYouth A were occurring.\nThe Complainant reported during the end of the hospital stay for\nFoster Youth A, the agency was providing supervision along with\nhospital staff. They reported there was frustration that the agency\nwas not seeking services or a placement for Foster Youth A.\nStaff 1, the agency foster care worker for Foster Youth A, was\ninterviewed via telephone on 08/15/24.

    "reiterated the agency was working with the hospital in a\ncollaborative way to provide coverage for Foster Youth A. The\nChief Nurse reported the agency staff were having to travel hours\nto provide supervision and she felt this was unnecessary.\nThe Chief Nurse reported the agency was actively working on\nsecuring services for Foster Youth A however details were\nsometimes not provided to hospital staff and communication could\nhave been better.
