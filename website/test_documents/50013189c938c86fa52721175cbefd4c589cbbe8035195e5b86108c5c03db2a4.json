He described this as an abandoned house in the\ncommunity that he goes to when he is AWOL. He stated both he\nand Youth B were living in this house for about a week. He\ndenied that any other persons were staying there with them. He\ndescribed the house as red, with no locking door, an upstairs,\nkitchen, three bedrooms and a back porch. He denied knowing\nthe address to the house. He reported that Youth B also got a\n“burn” like him and stated they burned each other.

Youth A again denied\nYouth B or any other youth have touched him inappropriately or in\nany sexual manner.\nAn interview was held with Youth B.

He confirmed that Youth A was also at the\nhouse but denied any other youth or adults were there. He stated\nthey stayed in the house for about five days. Youth B reported\nthat while they were in the house they were just sleeping, eating,\nvaping, smoking cigarettes and weed.

    "On 09/19/2024 a video interview was completed with Youth C.\nHe denied engagement in any sexual behavior with Youth A or\nany other youth at Wolverine. He admitted he would go AWOL,\nbut denied engaging in any type of inappropriate sexual contact\nwith Youth A.\nOn 09/24/2024 a case conference was held to discuss the safety\nconcerns of Youth A and Youth B and the likelihood of the\nburns/brands being marks of human trafficking. DHHS Specialist\n2 participated in the meeting and advised that the marks/burn is\nnot consistent with any markings in the data base that would\nindicate a human trafficking branding.\nOn 09/24/2024 a video conference was held with assigned Foster\nCare Worker1 and Foster Care Worker 2. No additional\nconcerns were noted.\nThe following interviews were completed onsite at Wolverine\nHuman Services on 10/03/2024, along with the DHHS\nSpecialist unless otherwise noted.\nAn interview was held with Youth D. He reported Youth A and\nYouth B go AWOL together all the time and they only come back\nto Wolverine to eat and sleep. He confirmed staff does not tell any\nof the youth to leave the building and staff always tell them about\nhow dangerous it is to AWOL. He reported feeling safe at the\nagency and denied observing staff hit youth or talk bad to them.\nYouth D did report that Youth A told him a couple of weeks ago\nthat Youth B raped him and put a sex toy up his butt. He denied\nknowledge of where this may have occurred. Youth D also\nreported that Youth B was saying that it was not him that raped\nYouth A, but it was Youth C. He was told by Youth B that there\nhas never been any sexual contact between he (Youth B) and\nYouth A. Youth D does not believe Youth A is afraid of Youth B as\nhe keeps going AWOL with him.\nYouth E was interviewed. He reported staff do not tell the youth\nto leave the facility and the boys that go AWOL just go AWOL on\ntheir own. He confirmed that staff try to talk people out of going\nAWOL, but some youth still go AWOL. He denied he has\nobserved any of the youth going AWOL lately. He confirmed\nYouth A and Youth B reside at the facility, but stated he has not\nseen them recently.\nChief Administrator was interviewed. She advised that both\nYouth A and Youth B declined medicals when they returned to\n4",
    "Wolverine. She reported there are no incident reports or video\nfootage of Youth A being sexually assaulted by Youth B or anyone\nelse. Chief Administrator reported that she believes if anything\nhappened it occurred while they were AWOL. She reported Youth\nA has staff with him all the time while he is in the building and on\nthe grounds of Wolverine since he is on 1:1 supervision. A safety\nplan was discussed regarding the youth.\nStaff 1 was interviewed. He reported Youth B will AWOL saying\nhe needed to go get weed or a breeze pen to smoke. He denied\nYouth B has ever given him any problems but reported that he\ncan't stay put at Wolverine and thinks being in the community is\nbetter. Staff 1 confirmed that he attempts to convince the youth,\nspecifically Youth B, not to AWOL because the neighborhood is\nbad and it's not safe. He denied he has ever told the youth to\nAWOL, nor has he heard other staff tell the youth to AWOL. He\nwould try to redirect the youth before they AWOL. He stated the\nyouth know staff can't put their hands on them to stop them so the\nyouth will AWOL. Staff 1 could not recall the events of 9/18/24\nspecifically, but he shared the process when a youth goes AWOL.\nHe reported staff will follow until the youth is out of sight and then\nwrite an incident report and contact law enforcement. Staff 1\nstated when Youth A and Youth B return, they will often refuse\nmedicals. He denied hearing anything about Youth A being\nsexually assaulted.\nOn 10/17/24 a Closing Case Conference was held with DHHS\nSpecialist. No findings of abuse or neglect were found.\nDocuments reviewed:\nOn 09/22/2024 DHHS specialist and I received an email\ncorrespondence from Chief Administrator. It documented the\nfollowing:\n• DHHS staff previously investigated similar allegations of\nsexual assault that Youth A made against another peer.\nThere were no findings.\n• Youth A is on 1:1 supervision since his initial intake date.\n• Youth B stated he was not going to go to the doctor for the\ninjury. This is typical for behavior for Youth B. The agency\nhas made attempts and so has the foster care worker and\nthe court.\n• Youth A originally agreed to go to Urgent Care if he could\nget McDonalds, but later changed his mind and did not go.\n• Both Youth A and Youth B have refused all attempts to\nobtain a medical exam at this point.\n5",
    "• The bed of Youth A was closed on 9/9/24 because he was\ngone for more than 24 hours. Calhoun County placed him\nwith Wolverine again on the 10th, despite the facility\nstrongly voicing their concerns for his increasingly unsafe\nbehaviors and inability to keep him safe when he continues\nto AWOL multiple times a day.\n• The bed of Youth B was closed on 09/11/24 because he\nwas gone more than 24 hours. Muskegon County placed\nhim with the facility again on the 9/18/24, despite the facility\nvoicing concerns for his continued unsafe behaviors.\nWolverine Supervision Policy: Indicates the primary job of all\nstaff is to maintain adequate coverage and Line of Sight of all\nyouth. Specifically, this means that youth are never left\nunattended for any amount of time so staff can view all behavior of\nthe youth. This ensures youth will not be abused; sexually,\nemotionally and/or physically.\nWolverine AWOL Policy: Staff will make efforts to verbally\nredirect truanting youth and offer support and alternatives to\ntruancy. If a non-supervising staff is available, they will walk with\nthe youth and continue to provide support and redirection. Staff\nwill immediately notify the Youth Care Specialist Supervisor on\nduty when line of sight is lost, no later than 15 minutes after line of\nsight is lost. The Youth Specialist Supervisor will contact the Lead\nSupervisor and Program Management to provide oversight for\nincident management. Staff will notify law enforcement and\nprogram director. Specifics about the youth will be provided to\nLaw enforcement and an Incident Report will be completed.\nWhen youth return:\nThe appropriate supervising agency will be contacted and all\nparties that were notified of the truancy must also be notified at\nthe time of return.\nAnalysis At the conclusion of the investigation, there was not sufficient\nevidence to support non-compliance with licensing rule 4109-1-c.\nBoth youth, staff and administrators were interviewed and all of\nthem reported that agency staff provides appropriate supervision\nand follows the written AWOL policy.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\n6",
    "Based on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n11/20/2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nCassandra Thomas Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n11/21/2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n7"
