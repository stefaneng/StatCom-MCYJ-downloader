    "Rule Code Staff responsibilities\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection • (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\nDescription directly responsible for all the following activities:\n• (a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home\ncare. Social service workers shall work directly with\nthe children, their families, and other relevant\nindividuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service\nplans for the children and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The IL Plus program accepted case management and then\nrefused to work with the parent. Failed to ensure the child had\naccess to food, failed to document IL skills, failed to gain state ID.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant/Foster Care Supervisor 1 – Complainant, who is\nalso Foster Care Supervisor 1, was interviewed via Microsoft\nTeams on 1/25/2024. She indicated she has been assigned as the\nfoster care supervisor at Lenawee County DHHS for Youth A’s\ncase since he came into care. Foster Care Supervisor 1 reported\nYouth A was referred to Community Care Organization’s\nIndependent Living Plus (ILP) home and program by Lenawee\nCounty DHHS staff upon removal from his parental home.\nCommunity Care Organization staff were made aware that Youth\nA had a goal of reunification and were informed they would be\nexpected to work with Youth A’s birth parent during the referral\nprocess and accepted the case. Foster Care Supervisor 1\nreported this is documented in email communications. After\naccepting Youth A’s case, Community Care Organization’s\nProgram Manager (Foster Care Supervisor 2) told Foster Care\nSupervisor 1 that Community Care Organization does not provide\nservices to birth parents. Foster Care Supervisor 1 reported she\nreviewed Community Care Organization’s contract and realized\nthey do not provide service to birth parents at which time Lenawee\nCounty DHHS took over case management of Youth A. Foster\nCare Supervisor 1 stated she was assigned as primary supervisor\nand a DHHS foster care worker was signed as the primary worker\non the case as of 7/24/2023. During this interview, Foster Care\nSupervisor 1 expressed her misunderstanding of the Independent\n2",
    "Living Plus contract. She came to the realization that Community\nCare Organization staff were not responsible for the allegations\nshe included in her complaint against them as they were no longer\nresponsible for case management of Youth A once she told them\nthe local office would be taking over case management\nresponsibility of Youth A.\nFoster Care Worker 1 – Foster Care Worker 1 was interviewed\nvia Microsoft Teams on 1/25/2024. She reported she was not the\ninitial DHHS foster care worker assigned but was assigned to\nYouth A’s case as primary foster care worker in August of 2023.\nShe reported she believed Community Care Organization staff\nwere responsible for providing food for youths who did not have\ntheir own and for obtaining Youth A’s state identification. She also\nreported she never received documentation of independent living\nskills education provided by Community Care Organization staff\ndespite having asked. During her interview, she did not fully\nunderstand the Independent Living Plus contract and, despite\nbeing assigned as primary foster care worker in August of 2023,\nshe had the expectation Community Care Organization staff would\nbe providing the foster care and independent living case\nmanagement.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 – Foster Care Supervisor 2, who is\nalso the Program Manager for Community Care Organization, was\ninterviewed via Microsoft Teams on 1/26/2024. She reported she\naccepted Youth A into Community Care Organization under the\nterms of their contract. She stated her understanding at the time\nthe case was accepted was that Lenawee County DHHS would\nhave family responsibility of the case to work with Youth A’s\nsibling and parents and Community Care Organization would have\ncase management of Youth A only, which is what has historically\nhappened whenever they accept a case involving parents and\nsiblings. Foster Care Supervisor 2 stated she was initially\nassigned as the supervisor for the whole case and had multiple\nconversations and email exchanges with Foster Care Supervisor 1\nto explain that she had only accepted case management\nresponsibilities on Youth A and that her agency could not provide\ncase management to the younger sibling and parents as their\ncontract does not allow them to do so. Foster Care Supervisor 2\nstated it did not seem as if Foster Care Supervisor 1 understood\nwhat Foster Care Supervisor 2 was attempting to explain and on\n7/24/2023 Lenawee County DHHS staff assigned themselves as\nprimary workers and supervisor on Youth A’s case resulting in\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 and her staff no longer having the ability\nto perform any primary functions within the electronic case record.\n3",
    "She stated she did ask Foster Care Supervisor 1 to add Foster\nCare Supervisor 2 back as primary supervisor on Youth A’s case\nmultiple times, but this never occurred. She indicated her agency\ncontinues to provide case management services as best they\ncould, but they had limitations due to not being assigned case\nmanagement responsibilities. She reported they did continue to\nprovide independent living skills training to Youth A, which they\nhave documented in their internal case record. She stated she\nwould ask someone at the agency to pull the closed record and\nprovide that documentation for review.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nPlacement history in Youth A’s electronic case record:\n• 6/16/2023 – 10/20/2023 Community Care Organization\nCase assignments in Youth A’s electronic case record:\n• Primary Supervisor\n6/16/2023 – 7/24/2023, Supervisor 2 (Community Care\nOrganization)\n7/24/2023 – 10/20/2023, Foster Care Supervisor 1\n(Lenawee DHHS)\n• Secondary Supervisor\n6/16/2023 – 7/24/2023, Foster Care Supervisor 1 (Lenawee\nDHHS)\n7/24/2023 – 10/20/2023, Supervisor 2 (Community Care\nOrganization)\n• Primary Worker\n6/16/2023 – 7/10/2023, Foster Care Worker 3 (Community\nCare Organization)\n7/10/2023-7/24/2023, Foster Care Worker 2 (Community\nCare Organization)\n7/24/2023 - 8/16/2023, Foster Care Worker 4 (Lenawee\nDHHS)\n8/16/2023 – 10/20/2024, Foster Care Worker 1 (Lenawee\nDHHS)\n• Secondary Worker\n6/16/2023 – 7/24/2023, Foster Care Worker 4 (Lenawee\nDHHS)\n6/21/2023 – 10/20/2023, Foster Care Worker 2 (Community\nCare Organization)\nCase Referral and Acceptance form (DHS-3600) effective date\n6/16/2023 signed by Program Manager 1 on 6/21/2023 and\n4",

    "visit. She stated they failed to get him treatment for his hand at the\ntime of the injury. She reported they also did not notify her of\nYouth A’s visit to the emergency room, rather a hospital social\nworker called her due to Community Care Organization staff not\nhaving proper medical care authorization, which Foster Care\nWorker 1 reported they had been previously given. She stated\nYouth A had gone to the emergency room after passing out and\nduring that visit, the doctor noticed Youth A had a hand injury\nresulting from previously punching a wall. She reported\nCommunity Care Organization did not follow-up on the\nrecommendations of the emergency room staff regarding\ntreatment for Youth A’s broken arm resulting in the bone healing\nincorrectly requiring future surgery. When asked if Youth A had\ninformed her of his hand injury or a need for medical care during\nher visits with him, she reported he did not. Foster Care 1 reported\nCommunity Care Organization did not maintain documentation of\nYouth A’s medication administration or when he refused to take\nhis medication. It was explained to Foster Care Worker 1 that ILP\nhomes are not responsible for securing, administering or\ndocumenting medications for youths in the program and that youth\nliving independently are responsible to maintain their own\nmedication and medical treatment.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 – Foster Care Supervisor 2, who is\nalso the Program Manager for Community Care Organization, was\ninterviewed via Microsoft Teams on 1/26/2024. She stated Youth\nA was brought to the emergency room after passing out while\nhorseplaying with another youth in the home. She reported she\nwas at the emergency room with Youth A at the time Foster Care\nWorker 2 was contacted for authorization and notification. She\nstated Youth A had been directly given the medical authorization\ncard (DHS 3762) by a previous worker, which he subsequently\nripped up. Foster Care Worker 2 stated she did not have a\nmedical authorization card for her agency and therefore could not\nauthorize any treatment.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nAll the following documents were reviewed in Youth A’s electronic\ncase record:\n• 6/16/2023 Consent to Routine, Non-Surgical, Medical Care,\nand Emergency Medical/Surgical Treatment card (DHS-\n3762) for Youth A. The caregiver section, which identified\nwho has the authority to consent to treatment, is left blank.\n• 7/31/2023 Incident Report written by Community Care\nOrganization staff documenting Youth A punched a wall.\nNo injury or complaints of pain were documented.\n11",
    "• 8/7/2024 Case Contact written by Lenawee County DHHS\nstaff, Foster Care Worker 4, documenting face to face with\nYouth A. No injury, complaint of pain, or request for medical\ntreatment were documented by Foster Care Worker 4.\n• 8/7/2024 Case Contact written by Foster Care Worker 4\ndocumenting the medical authorization card (DHS-3762)\nwas given directly to Youth A.\n• 8/23/2023 Emergency Room discharge form documenting\nCommunity Care Organization staff brought Youth A to the\nEmergency room for a potential head injury at which time\nthe doctor made recommendations for follow-up care for an\ninjury to Youth A’s hand/arm.\nAnalysis At the time Youth A was brought to the emergency room on\n8/28/2023, Lenawee DHHS had already taken over case\nmanagement responsibility. Foster Care Supervisor 2’s report that\nher agency did not have authorization to consent to medical care\ndue to the authorization card being given to Youth A directly is\nreflected in the case record. Follow-up medical care services\nwould have been the responsibility of Foster Care Worker 1 and\nYouth A. Additionally, follow-up mental health services would have\nto have been authorized by Foster Care Worker 1, as the\nassigned foster care worker.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.

Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nFebruary 23, 2024\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 29, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n12"
