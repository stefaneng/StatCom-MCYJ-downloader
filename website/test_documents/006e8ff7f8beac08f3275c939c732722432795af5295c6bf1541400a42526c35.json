    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules.\n2.) This facility is non-contracted therefore, MISEP requirements are not applicable.\n3.) MDHHS Contract: The agency is non-contracted therefore the MDHHS contact is\nnot applicable.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nThe agency was informed that under ACT NO. 116 OF THE PUBLIIC ACTS OF\n1973, AS AMENDED Effective March 28, 2018, all Licensing Rules for Child\nPlacing Agencies apply to a licensed CPA agency. The Court Administrator, who is\nalso the Chief Administrator of the agency, was provided the reference in PA 116\nwhich defines a CPA agency and its responsibilities under the act.\nThe agency reported that they have a non-responsive foster home whose license\nexpired in January 2023. The Chief Administrator and home licensor were advised\nto send the foster parent a formal letter informing them that their license will be\nclosed if the home remains non-responsive to requests from the agency for contact.\nThe DCWL corrective action form with instructions were provided to the Chief\nAdministrator.\nV. CONSULTATION\nConsultation was not required or requested at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency was not required to submit a corrective action plan during the licensing\nperiod. There were no complaints filed against the agency during the licensing\nperiod.\nChief Administrators Assessment: The assessment noted that the agency\nremains in compliance with licensing rules. The assessment noted that an agency\nfoster home is in non-compliance as they are not responding to requests from the\nagency to conduct a renewal inspection of the home. The assessment also spoke to\nthe problem of gaining access to LMS as this is currently an issue for non-contracted\nprograms.\nInterviews: Discussion occurred with the Chief Administrator jointly with the\nprogram licensing supervisor. They discussed recruitment efforts that have been\nconducted and their desire to obtain foster homes. The home licensor reported that\n3",
    "she has obtained certification and complaint training. Discussion also involved\nwhether Part 4. Foster Care Services, pertains to government operated programs.\nTechnical assistance was provided.\nVII. CPA ANALYST FINDINGS: The agency is a non-contracted Court operated agency\ntherefore the CPA Analyst was not required to be involved in the auditing process.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the facility continue on a regular license.\nFebruary 7, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDouglas W Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 20, 2023\n______________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
