No youth aged 18 or over will be admitted.\nHost homes for placement will be recruited and trained to meet all safety standards, but\nthey will not be licensed as foster homes by the agency.\nThe agency will employ sufficient staff that meet all licensing requirements to provide\nsupervision and documentation of services consistent with all applicable licensing\nrequirements for independent living.\nA statement of need and an acceptable projected budget have been submitted.\nC.
