    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Supervisor 1 threatened youth with physical harm.\nInvestigation The complainant for these allegations was anonymous, so no\nadditional information was collected.\nYouth A was interviewed during an unannounced, face-to-face\nvisit to the facility on 12/12/2023. Youth A stated he has had\nissues with Supervisor 1 but none that rose to the level of any\nsafety concerns. Youth A stated he had filed a grievance on\nSupervisor 1 a month prior, regarding issues with concerns about\nSupervisor 1 being unfair with snacks. Youth A stated he has\nheard Supervisor 1 get upset with other youth in the program, but\nnever to the point of threatening them or stating anything\nresembling “I’m going to slam your head into a wall.”\nYouth B was interviewed during an unannounced, face-to-face\nvisit to the facility on 12/12/2023. He stated Supervisor 1 has a\n“cool” temperament and he has never stated anything that\nappeared to be a threat towards any youth.\nStaff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Supervisor 2, Supervisor 3, and\nSupervisor 4, and Supervisor 5 were all interviewed separately\nduring a face-to-face, announced visit to the facility on\n01/04/2024. All staff had similar work experiences with Supervisor\n1 in that they have never heard him specifically use the phrase\n“smash your head against a wall” to any youth. These staff all\nstated they have not heard Supervisor 1 say anything like this to\nor away from the youth. These staff all stated they have never\nheard Supervisor 1 speak in an aggressive manner toward youth\nor use any threatening language toward youth.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed during a face-to-face, announced\nvisit to the facility on 01/04/2024. He denied using any language\nthat could have been considered aggressive or threatening\ntowards any youth during his time working in the program,\nspecifically and including statements similar to “I’m going to\nsmash your head against a wall.” He also stated he has talked\nwith other staff about past experiences working in other similar\nprograms but that these conversations never contained topics\nabout harming or threatening youth during those past work\nexperiences.\n2",
    "Staff 5 was interviewed over video conference on 01/09/2024 and\nstated he has never heard Supervisor 1 use any threatening\nlanguage toward youth in the program.\nYouth C, Youth D, Youth E and Youth F were all interviewed\nseparately over the phone on 01/09/2024. All of the youth stated\nthey have never heard Supervisor 1 use threatening language\ntowards themselves or other youth in the program. Youth F did\nnote that he believed he had heard Supervisor 1 state in a joking\nmanner that he would “smash you against the wall” to another\nyouth, but he could not remember who this was or when this may\nhave occurred. Youth F stated he believed this was joking\nbecause the other youth that he could not specify had stated\nsomething similar and both that youth and Supervisor 1 were\nlaughing and then the brief interaction ended.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• A Grievance Form authored by Youth A dated 11/30/2023\nwas reviewed. This grievance was consistent with the\ninformation provided by Youth A in his interview in that it\nwas regarding interactions with Supervisor 1 but it did not\ncontain any concerns about threats or the safety of youth.\n• There was no discipline noted in Supervisor 1’s personnel\nfile.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff there was not sufficient\nevidence found to show that Supervisor 1 has threatened youth\nwith physical harm.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Public Act 116 722.120 (c) Investigation, inspection, and\nSection examination of conditions, books, records, and reports.\nDescription\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Supervisor 1 has falsified documents such as incident reports.\nInvestigation Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Supervisor 2, Supervisor 3, and\nSupervisor 4, and Supervisor 5 were all interviewed separately\nduring a face-to-face, announced visit to the facility on\n01/04/2024. All staff members reported a similar process that the\nfacility uses in the writing of Incident Reports. They stated a\nYouth Specialist is responsible for authoring the first draft of this\ndocumentation, and they send their copy to a printer in the office.\nOne of the supervisors on duty then receives the documentation\nand they review it and either sign off on it if it is ready to be\ncompleted or provide feedback to the Youth Specialist that\n3",
    "authored it. Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 4 all individually\nstated they have authored incident reports that have been\nreviewed by Supervisor 1 and have never had concerns that this\ninformation was changed without their consent or falsified in any\nway. Supervisor 2 and Supervisor 3 both stated individually that\nthey have seen Supervisor 1 provide feedback to staff that could\nbe considered specific, detailed or critical, but also shared that\nthey have not seen or had concern of Supervisor 1 falsifying\ndocumentation.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed during a face-to-face, announced\nvisit to the facility on 01/04/2024. He described a similar process\nfor the writing and review of incident reports. Supervisor 1 denied\nthat he has ever falsified documentation, nor has he altered the\nwriting of what was provided to him without discussing it with staff.\nHe stated he often provides very specific feedback to staff, and\nthere are times when a document like an incident report has gone\nback and forth between him and a staff member before it is ready\nto be completed. Supervisor 1 stated at times, he has sat down\nnext to a staff member who was writing incident reports to provide\nfeedback and coaching on how it could be completed properly, but\nthat this never occurred without the staff’s involvement or consent.\nStaff 5 was interviewed over video conference on 01/09/2024. He\nstated he has authored multiple incident reports that were\nreviewed by Supervisor 1. Staff 5 stated Supervisor 1 is very\ndetailed and can often ask for several changes to a document, but\nthat this has never resulted in documentation being altered or\nfalsified in any way.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Facility policy titled “Institutional Operations” dated\n11/28/2022 was reviewed. This described the process of\nwhat is needed for a complete Incident Report and what\nsteps must be taken to write it and have it approved, all\nconsistent with staff interviews.\n• 20 incident reports that were approved by Supervisor 1\nduring the month prior to the initiation of this investigation\nwere reviewed and no concerning elements were noted.\nAnalysis Through interviews with staff and documentation reviewed there\nwas not sufficient evidence found to show that Supervisor 1 has\nfalsified documents at the program.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
