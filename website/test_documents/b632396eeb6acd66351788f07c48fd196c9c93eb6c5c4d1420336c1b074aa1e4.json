    "INVESTIGATION:\nOn August 13, 2021, I interviewed Director in person at the facility with another\nDHHS Worker to discuss the complaint. A list of staff and youth to interview was\nprovided. Director stated she made the decision to have a staff transport a youth\nthat was having an asthma attack to the hospital knowing it would leave the facility\nout of ratio. The Director felt the youth’s medical need was more important than\nstaff-to-resident ratio. The on-call administrator met the youth and staff person at\nthe hospital, then the staff person returned to the facility.\nOn August 13, 2021, I interviewed Staff 1 in person at the facility with another DHHS\nWorker. Staff 1 reported there was an emergency at the facility the night of August\n10, 2021, where a youth was taken to the hospital by staff. Staff 1 reported this left\nthe facility with eight youth and two staff. Staff 1 reported five youth were in the\nmedia room and he could not recall where the other three youth were at the time of\npassing medication. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 sat with her back to the double doors\nleading outside so she could watch the youth in the media room and down both\nhallways of where the youth sleep. Staff 1 reported he was in the doorway of the\noffice passing medication and also able to see the youth in the media room.\nStaff 1 reported he was in the office, calling youths’ names to pass out medication.\nStaff 1 stated he called Youth A’s name three times before Youth A came to the\noffice to get his medication. Staff 1 reported he heard Staff 2 ask Youth B what she\nwas doing and where she came from. Staff 1 stated he never saw Youth B in the\nmedia room or walk through the media room. Staff 1 reported the facility was out of\nratio while Staff 4 transported a youth to the Reed City Hospital.\nOn August 13, 2021, I interviewed Staff 2 in person at the facility with another DHHS\nWorker. Staff 2 reported that right before medications had to be passed that a youth\nwas taken to the hospital by another staff. Staff 2 stated there were nine youth and\ntwo staff. Staff 2 stated Youth B went to her bedroom prior to medications being\npassed. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 checked on Youth A in his bedroom right before\nStaff 1 started to pass medication. Staff 2 reported checking on Youth B in Youth\nB’s bedroom prior to Staff 1 passing medications.\nStaff 2 stated she sat with her back to the front doors so she could watch the media\nroom and the hallways. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was in the office passing medication\nto the youth. Staff 2 stated she saw Youth B run out from the boy’s hallway into the\nkitchen. Staff 2 stated she asked Youth B what she was doing. Staff 2 stated at this\ntime Youth A entered the media room from his bedroom to get his medication. Staff\n2 stated that Youth A and Youth B sat in the media room with the other youth, and\nshe heard some of them saying something about, “first time.”\nStaff 2 reported that she talked with Youth B, and she said that she had sex with\nYouth A. Staff 2 reported prior to medications being passed Youth A was in his\nbedroom on his gaming system. Staff 2 stated Youth B was in her bedroom prior to\n3",
    "medications being passed. The bedrooms are on different hallways. Staff 2 denied\never seeing Youth B come out of her bedroom, cross in front of her through the\nmedia room and walk down the boy’s hallway. Staff 2 guessed Youth A went out the\nwindow in the girl’s hallway and entered the window in either the boy’s hallway or\nYouth A’s bedroom. Staff 2 reported the facility was out of ratio while Staff 4\ntransported a youth to the Reed City Hospital.\nOn August 13, 2021, I interviewed Staff 3 in person at the facility with another DHHS\nWorker. Staff 3 reported he met with Youth A and Youth A admitted to having sex\nwith Youth B. Youth A described it as consensual. Staff 3 reported Youth A told him\nYouth B got caught by staff when Youth B walked out of Youth A’s bedroom.\nOn August 13, 2021, I interviewed Staff 4 in person at the facility with another DHHS\nWorker. Staff 4 reported she took the youth that was having an asthma attack to the\nhospital and was not at the facility when Youth B was caught coming out of Youth\nA’s bedroom. Staff 4 stated as soon as she returned to the facility from the hospital,\nthe youth were talking about Youth A and Youth B having sex. Staff 4 reported\nhearing rumors that Youth A and Youth B were going to try and run away and have\nsex. Staff 4 reported she believes that Youth A and Youth B took advantage of the\nsituation where a staff was gone at the hospital to get together. Staff 4 reported the\nfacility was out of ratio while Staff 4 transported a youth to the Reed City Hospital.\nStaff 4 reported leaving the facility at approximately 8:00pm and returning to the\nfacility approximately 8:54pm. During this time there were eight youth and two staff.\nOn August 13, 2021, I interviewed Youth A in person at the facility with another\nDHHS Worker. Youth A stated two staff, he could not remember who, were\nwatching the other youth in the media room when Youth B entered his bedroom.\nYouth A stated he, “does not know how” Youth B got into his bedroom. Youth A\nstated he had sex with Youth B and when Youth B walked out of his bedroom staff\nsaw Youth B. Youth A stated, “the opportunity presented itself” because there was a\nstaff at the hospital with a youth.\nOn August 13, 2021, I interviewed Youth B in person at the facility with another\nDHHS Worker. Youth B stated it was “preplanned” that she would go to Youth A’s\nbedroom to have sex. Youth B reported the way Staff 4 was sitting, Staff 4 did not\nsee her go out her door and come in the window in the kitchen. Youth B was asked\nto describe how she left her bedroom and entered the kitchen window a couple of\ntimes as the scenario does not make sense as a way to get into Youth A’s bedroom.\nYouth B did not change her description of how she entered Youth A’s bedroom.\nOn August 13, 2021, I interviewed Youth C in person at the facility. Youth C\nreported he was sitting in the media room the night Youth A and Youth B had sex.\nYouth C stated Staff 2 was sitting with her back facing the door that leads outside\nand watching the youth in the media room. Youth C stated Staff 1 was in the office\npassing medication. Youth C denies ever seeing Youth B cross the media room and\n4",
    "enter the boy’s hallway.
