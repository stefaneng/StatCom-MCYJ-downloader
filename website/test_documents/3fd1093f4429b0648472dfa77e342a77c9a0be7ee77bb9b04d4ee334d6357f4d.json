    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Within the last month, the lights in a unit were off. Two youth\nengaged in sexual activity. The youth are in a relationship and\nstaff are aware. The two youth would turn the lights off and do\nwhat they wanted to do including pushing beds together. It is\nunknown why the youth have not been separated.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nSupervisor Z was interviewed via telephone on October 10,\n2024. Supervisor Z said Youth A and Youth B are “supposedly in a\nrelationship” and they got into an argument with Youth C so he\nand Staff 1 took Youth C on a walk outside. Supervisor Z said\nwhile on the walk Youth C said Youth A and Youth B are having\nsexual contact and sexual intercourse. Supervisor Z said this was\nthe first time he had ever heard of this type of interaction occurring\nbetween Youth A and Youth B. Supervisor Z said he has never\nseen any sexual touching between Youth A and Youth B however\nis aware that they have “bad boundaries” with one another and\nmany incident reports have been written about their boundaries.\nSupervisor Z said Youth A and Youth B pushed their beds together\nin an isle and have been sleeping like that for a while. Supervisor\nZ said the staff have been struggling to get Youth A and Youth B to\nfollow directions and they will turn the lights off in the unit, refuse\nto move their beds, and refuse to follow programming. Supervisor\nZ said if it was up to him he would have separated the youth prior\nto this investigation however stated it is up to the therapist, case\nmanager, and Director to make that decision.\nYouth A was interviewed via telephone on October 2, 2024, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth A said she is currently\non unit five by herself, stating her peers were moved out of her\nunit. Youth A said Youth B was moved off her unit and told it was\n“best for her program”. Youth A said she is very upset about this\nas she was “best friends” with Youth B, denying being in a\nromantic relationship with her. Youth A said Youth C told Staff 1\nthat she and Youth B “did something inappropriate, like kiss or\nsomething” which then led to the units being changed. Youth A\nsaid Youth C reported it happened prior to September 12, 2024,\nhowever she denied anything “like that” ever happening. Youth A\nsaid Youth C is making these allegations because she is mad that\nshe and Youth B laughed at her for “doing stuff with the boys”.\nYouth A said she and Youth B used to argue but over time they\nstarted to get along much better and now they only interact with\neach other and help each other get through the program. Youth A\nsaid recently Youth B has helped her through the death of a\nfriend, and self-harming thoughts. Youth A said she, Youth B, and\n3",
    "Youth C all pushed their beds together in the same isle to make a\n“king” size bed and slept that way for several nights. Youth A said\nstaff told them that was not allowed and redirected them to put the\nbeds back in their own isles however they did not listen.

Youth A said the\nstaff would always sit at the end of the isle and watch them all\nnight and denied anything physical or sexual ever occurring.\nYouth A said the lights in the unit would be off but the “PREA\nLight” in the middle of the unit was always on so the staff would be\nable to see the youth all night. Youth A said Staff 1 as well as the\nother staff were always supervising them throughout the night and\nduring the day.

Youth B denied any sexual interactions with Youth\nA or any other youth while being placed at Vassar House. Youth B\nsaid Youth C told Supervisor Z that she and Youth B had oral sex\nand have been having sexual intercourse which is not true, stating\nYouth C is only saying this because she is jealous of Youth A and\nYouth B’s friendship. Youth B said she, Youth A, and Youth C all\npushed their beds together in September 2024. Youth B said they\nwere all “acting a fool” and just wanted to have a “sleepover”\nknowing that it was against the rules and program. Youth B said\nstaff redirected the youth and told them to move the beds back to\ntheir own spots, but the youth refused. Youth B said all of the staff\nsupervised them the entire time they had their beds together.\nYouth B said they would all sleep in their own beds with their own\ncovers just all pushed together.
