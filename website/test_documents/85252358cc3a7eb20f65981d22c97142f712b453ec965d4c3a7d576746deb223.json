During the special evaluation, the foster parent admitted to\nhitting the youth. The foster home was found in violation of the foster home’s\nbehavor management rule. A corrective action plan was developed with the foster\nfamily that included the foster parents reframing using physical punishment, and\ncompleting training on behavior management, and the managment of a children\nwith a mood disorder.\nThe agency abided by all timeframes and standards pertaining to this special\nevaluation except R400.12327(5)(d) for which they received a rule citation.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period. This corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2022 Renewal\ninspection where the agency received the following rule and policy violations:\n• MCL 722.120(3) Investigation, Inspection, and examination of conditions,\nbook, records, reports…\n• R400.12202(1)(d) Policy and procedures.\n5",

The agency also provided proofs and or examples of\nvarious action steps and monitoring that were to occur, such as outlook monitoring\nof annual ICHAT due dates and performance evaluations, as well as email\nreminders to supervisors of upcoming performance evaluations; foster care\nsupervisor/worker supervisions; and submission of those notes to the program\ndirector monthly for retention in the program director’s binder; email reminder of\nupcoming service plans and medical due dates; spreadsheets, checklists; and\nfolders containing proofs of action summaries. Various other corrective action\nplan proofs were shown via the record inspection, which illustrated improvements.\nThe agency admitted that items such as, the supervisor and director pulling and\nreviewing all special evaluation for their thoroughness; and the program director\nrandomly auditing special evaluation reports monthly did not occur, as they had\nhoped. They are continuing to work on all the items in the corrective action plan\nwhich was developed under the prior chief administrator.\nNotwithstanding the progress the agency made on this corrective plan, all aspects\nwere not totally successful. The agency received a few repeat violations as\nindicated in this inspection report.\nChief Administrator Assessment\n6",
    "A chief administrator's annual report was submitted to me dated 4/30/2023. No\nareas of concerns were noted.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided an annual budget for foster care and adoption, and an\nannual independent financial audit. No concerns were observed.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe interviews with staff were all basically positive. Areas of limitations reported\nby staff centered on improving communication related to services and when\nchanges occur; and establishing more targeted resources for birth parents.\nThe agency does not have an independent living program, so youth interviews\nwere not required.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA tour of the facility was conducted, and no areas of concern were observed.\nVI. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were three safety alerts.\nSafety Alert # 1\nConcern:\nThe Division of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL) Analyst scheduled a home visit with\nthe foster parent for 4/04/2023. The home visit did not occur due issues with the\nfoster parent. The DCWL Analyst attempted to reschedule the home visit, but the\nfoster parent did not follow back up with the DCWL Analyst. The DCWL Analyst\nadvised the agency of the lack of contact with the foster parent, and the agency’s\nneeds to verify the safety of the home.\nResolution:\nThe agency reported there are no children placed in the foster home, and the home\nhad been on hold status since 7/12/2022. Notwithstanding, the agency made an\nunannounced home visit to the foster home on 4/6/2023. During that home visit\nmultiple concerns and safety issues were observed. Those included lots of clutter, a\nmattress and box spring blocking a window, a detached/nonfunctional smoke\ndetector; a microwave in the middle of the living room floor; garbage in the kitchen;\na dog cowering in a corner in the kitchen with an empty bowl; a crib mattress\nstanding against the kitchen table with a large slash in the mattress; no physical crib\nwas observed. On the second level in the home, the bathroom toilet was not\nworking, cigarette butts were in the toilet; there was a smoke detector located in the\nhallway which was observed and tested to be in proper working order. No guns\nwere reported to be in the home; no home phone was observed. There was running\nwater in the sink, tub, and shower, but the toilet did not flush with the handle. The\nagency provided photos of the home’s many maintenance issues. The\n7",
    "agency initiated a special evaluation on this foster home on 4/6/2023.\nSafety Alert # 2\nConcern:\nThe DCWL Analyst made a number of attempts to schedule a home visit with the foster\nparent between 2/13/2023 and 3/1/2023 without success.

The foster\nparent apologized, advised of personal issues and a wish to not renew her license. The\nfoster home license was voluntarily closed on 3/9/2023.\nSafety Alert # 3\nConcern\nThe unlicense relative caregiver did not have operable smoke detectors on each level of\noccupancy of the home and/or near all sleeping areas. Nor an operable carbon\nmonoxide detector in the home.\nResolution:\nThe Foster Care Supervisor make a home visit to the home. A safety plan was put in\nplaced regarding the smoke/carbon monixode detector.
