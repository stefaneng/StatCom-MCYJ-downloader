    "Supervisor 1 attempted to deescalate Youth A. Staff 2 reported\nSupervisor 1 did not show signs of hostility nor did he threaten\nYouth A or use profanity.

Youth A reported he could not\nremember all of the conversation or the specific words but\nsummarized that Supervisor 1 threatened to physically harm him.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 threatened to “slap him.” Youth A\nreported he couldn’t remember if Supervisor 2 said anything.\nYouth A reported Staff 2 did not say anything.\nRecorded Phone Conversation:\nComplainant 1 had a recording of the conversation between Youth\nA and Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, Staff 1 and Staff 2. This\nrecording is from 1/24/24. Administrator 1 verified the voice on the\nphone to be Supervisor 1 when he listened to the audio. Staff 1,\nStaff 2, Supervisor 1, and Supervisor 2 reported Supervisor 1 was\nthe staff member verbally attempting to deescalate Youth A. Youth\nA Reported Supervisor 1 was the main staff talking to him.\nThe audio revealed Youth A threatening and using profanity\ntowards staff. The recording also revealed Supervisor 1 raising his\nvoice at Youth A, using profanity towards Youth A, and\nthreatening Youth A. Staff 1 also used profanity towards Youth A.\nThe following are comments Supervisor 1 stated to Youth A:\n• “What other computer did I take? Mother fucker, I took? Get\nthe fuck on.”\n• “What the fuck am I supposed to do? Have I ever fucked\nyou over…”\n• “People always taking your shit…(unclear ending)”\n• “I have a right to be mad because I respected you in every\nway but you didn’t respect me. You talk about people taking\nyour shit, I didn’t take shit from you.”\n• “If you don’t want to talk, don’t talk, I’ll shut the fuck up, if\nyou hit me, I’ll eat it, make the police report and then catch\nyour mother fucking ass off campus.”\n4",
    "Staff 1 responded to Youth A calling her a “mother fucker” by\nstating, “I ain’t no mother fucker.”\nNeither Supervisor 2 nor Staff 2 was heard in the audio.\nDocuments:\nMCHS Family of Services Program Statement\nThe treatment philosophy. Is based on a trauma-focused, whole\nsystem approach to the therapeutic milieu…Our major goal is to\nprovide treatment that effectively meets the emotional, cognitive,\nsocial, and developmental needs of the youth in care. Treatment\nteams utilize their relationships with the young persons and\nfamilies to empower them to find solutions to their problems and\nmaximize their potential.\nAnalysis Although all four staff interviewed reported they handled the\nsituation well with Youth A, it is clear from audio recording that\nSupervisor 1 was yelling at Youth A and used profanity towards\nYouth A and threatened Youth A’s physical wellbeing. Staff 1\nresponded back to Youth A using profanity.\nConsultation: Supervisor 1 is a facility manager for the agency.\nSupervisor 2 is the supervisor for the unit. The unit serves an\nabuse and neglect population. It would benefit the agency to\nevaluate the roles they have personnel in and whether they are\nfulfilling these roles. It would also benefit the agency to evaluate if\nthis type of environment is fulfilling a trauma informed\nenvironment.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",

    "Interviews:\nAdministrator 1\nAdministrator 1 reported the agency does not have documentation\nfor the searches for Youth A written on the Personal and Room\nSearch Forms. Administrator 1 reported they should be\ncompleting searches on youth in this unit.\nSupervisor 1\nSupervisor 1 reported the youth are to be searched when they\ncome to the unit from school. Supervisor 1 reported the search\nshould be to have them pull their pockets out, put hats inside out,\ngo around their waistbands and ankle cuffs, remove shoes and\nsocks and open their backpacks.\nStaff 1\nStaff 1 reported they are currently doing searches on youth when\nthey enter the unit. Staff 1 reported someone is picking up the\nyouth from school and drops them off at the unit. Once they get to\nthe unit, they ask the youth if they have permission to search\nthem. Staff 1 reported they “pat” the youth down on the outside of\ntheir clothing and then have the youth open up their own\nbackpack. Staff 1 reported they do not have the youth take\nanything out of their backpack, but staff look into their backpacks.\nStaff 1 reported searching youth started about two months ago.\nStaff1 reported they have found lighters, computers and phone\nchargers.\nSupervisor 2\nSupervisor 2 reported they search all youth when they return to\nthe cottage from school. Supervisor 2 reported they use a “wand”\nto wand the youth. Supervisor 2 reported they have youth take\ntheir coats off and remove any metal they may have on them.\nThey then wand them with the metal detector wand. Supervisor 2\nreported they had to have some sort of probable cause in order to\nsearch them. Supervisor 2 reported they now do because the\nyouth are getting paraphernalia into the cottages. Supervisor 2\nreported they have been searching now for two months.\nSupervisor 2 reported after they wand the youth, they then have\nthe youth open their backpacks and look inside them. Supervisor\n2 reported they do not have the youth empty their backpacks and\ndo not pat the youth down or have them remove items of clothing\n(shoes and socks) or check waistbands.\n10",
    "Staff 2\nStaff 2 reported staff are now completing searches on youth. Staff\n2 did not know the time frame this has been occurring. Staff 2\nreported he pats them on the outside of their clothing and has the\nyouth open their backpacks for him to look into it.\nDocuments:\nI reviewed the Residential Treatment Overview: Section E.\nNumber 8. Searches.\nAll residents can be searched upon return to campus as follows:\nupon return from school…probable cause…\nLevel 1 Search: this is a soft search. This is routine search that\noccurs upon return to the resident’s cottage from an unsupervised\nouting, from an unsupervised visit, or off grounds school\nattendance. Level 1 always occurs prior to a Level 2 Search.\n• Ask the person to flip out the inside of pockets.\n• Ask the young person to empty backpack.\n• Allow staff to visually inspect backpack as needed.\nLevel 2 Search: This is a more restrictive approach based upon\npositive findings on Level 1, resistance, or continued probably\ncause. This is completed by the shift supervisor or another\nresidential supervisor.\n• This can include a pat-down search.\n• Always use back of hands\n• Utilizing rubber gloves if needed\n• Ask the young person to flip or undo waistbands while staff\nobserves.\n• Ask the young person to search their own hair while staff\nobserves.\n• Ask the young person to remove shoes.\n• Staff should visibly inspect each shoe for contraband.\n• Ask socks to be removed for visual inspection as well\n…The searches are to be documented on the Personal and Room\nSearch Forms that are in the cottages and submitted to the\nAssistant Cottage Supervisor.\nAnalysis The agency is not following their MCHS Family of Services\nProgram Statement concerning transportation to and from school.\nAccording to Administrator 1 the agency does not pick up youth\nfrom school if they are off grounds. Administrator 1 reported this is\ntheir common practice.\n11",
    "Administrator 1 reported this particular unit should be completing\nphysical searches with their youth in this unit. The agency is not\nfollowing their Searches policy.\n• Based on interviews and review of Searches Policy, there\nis an inconsistent understanding of how to search a youth.\nPolicy is not being followed as outlined. Each\nstaff/supervisor searching the youth are completing them in\na different manner.\n• Administrator 1 reported there are no Personal and Room\nSearch Forms completed for the searches that have\noccurred for Youth A. Administrator 1 was unable to\nproduce these documents for review.\nTECHNICAL ASSITANCE: It would benefit the agency to review\ncurrent policies to ensure what is written in them is what the\nagency practices. Although only two policies were reviewed for\nthis investigation, the agency may want to review all of their\npolicies to ensure they are practicing what is written in them. It\nwould also benefit the agency to assess whether the searches\nthey do have outlined in the policy are sufficient for the care\nneeded for the youth in their program.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n3/7/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
