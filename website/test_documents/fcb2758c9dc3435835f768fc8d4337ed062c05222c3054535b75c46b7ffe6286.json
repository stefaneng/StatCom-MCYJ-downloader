    "Allegation Staff 1 was verbally confrontational and escalated Youth A rather\nthan use verbal de-escalation techniques as trained.\nInvestigation I contacted identified witness, Methodist’s Case Manager, via\nphone on 10/04/23 asking her to identify the youth and direct care\nstaff involved. Case Manager recalled the situation and identified\nYouth A. She said the staff involved was female but was unable\nto positively identify her.\nOn 10/9/23 I notified Chief Administrator of the allegation and\nrequested names of all the female direct care staff who worked on\n9/19/23. Chief Administrator identified Staff 1 as the person\ninvolved.\nI notified Complainant, also Youth A’s private agency adoption\nworker, that I was assigned this investigation. She had no\nadditional concerns about the facility.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI arrived at the facility on 10/09/23 and interviewed Case\nManager. She said on 9/19/23 she facilitated the monthly visit\nbetween Youth A and Complainant in the clinical building. “Youth\nA is autistic. He got upset because his worker would not take him\noff campus. He walked out. Complainant and I followed him\noutdoors. Youth A was angry. Complainant tried to de-escalate\nhim. I tried to get him to return to Clinical. He refused. Staff 1\nwas outside.” Youth A asked Staff 1 to confirm in front of\nComplainant that he’s been ‘good’ (and deserves to go off-\ncampus). Staff 1 mentioned that earlier in the day, Youth A called\nher out of her name, and she redirected him to continue visiting\nwith Complainant. Youth A became more upset because Staff 1\ndid not affirm him. “I suggested the worker and I remove\nourselves. We walked back to clinical. Complainant was shocked\nat Youth A’s behavior and remarked that she had never seen him\nact that way. Complainant did not mention anything about Staff\n1’s interaction with the youth.\nOn 10/05/23, Case Manager said she attended a virtual meeting\nwith Complainant. During the meeting Complainant complimented\nher approach with Youth A on 9/19/23 and mentioned that she\nthought Youth A’s behavior escalated while he was talking with\nStaff 1. In the meeting, Case Manager said she verbally\nsupported Staff 1 and her ability to avoid ‘feeding in’ to Youth A’s\nmotives to get off-campus. However, Complainant said she\nviewed Staff 1 as ‘going back and forth debating’ with the youth.\n2",
    "Case Manager denied Staff 1 was debating with the youth.\nRather she said she was setting boundaries and being direct.\nCase Manager believes Complainant misinterpreted the\ninteraction.\nI attempted to interview Youth A, but he was having an emotional\nbreakdown while I was at the facility. I heard a boy screaming,\ncrying, and banging on the window of the interview room and was\ntold it was Youth A. I walked outdoors and observed Youth A\nstanding red-faced against a tree screaming at the top of his\nlungs. Staff were outdoors trying to de-escalate him.\nI interviewed Residential Director who was outdoors on 9/19/23\nwhen Youth A became angry with Complainant and walked out of\nthe visit. “Youth A was banging on doors and screaming out of\ncontrol like he is now, threatening to destroy Staff 1’s car. Like\nStaff 1, I tried to limit-set with him too,” he explained. Residential\nDirector did not view Staff 1’s behavior as inappropriate.\nI interviewed Staff 1 who has worked at the facility for five years.\nOutdoors, she said Youth A was threatening to break the windows\nout of her personal vehicle. “I asked him not to step by my car,\nthat I would not allow him to destroy it. He came within arms-\nreach of my car. I got between him and my car. He backed up\nand I told him not to touch my car. Youth A veered away and\ncontinued screaming and hollering. I asked why he was upset.\nResidential Director was there.”\nI asked Staff 1 if Complainant was within earshot of her verbal\ninteraction with Youth A. She said she may have heard her shout\nand direct him not to touch her car, but otherwise Complainant\nwas not close enough to hear the interaction. Staff 1 denied\ncausing or escalating Youth A’s acting out behaviors.\nI reviewed the written Verbal Escalation Continuum. It indicates\nwhen a youth shows an unwillingness to cooperate or follow\ninstructions, appropriate staff interventions include limit setting\nand redirection.\nAnalysis There is no evidence Staff 1 caused Youth A’s behavior to\nescalate on 9/19/23. By setting limits and redirecting, Staff 1\nresponded appropriately to Youth A’s attempts to manipulate\nComplainant, threats to destroy Staff 1’s car and his general\nunwillingness to follow directions.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nOctober 10, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 10, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
