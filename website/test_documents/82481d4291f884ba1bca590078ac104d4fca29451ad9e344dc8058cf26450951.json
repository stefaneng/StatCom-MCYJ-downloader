He stated he was one of the medical personnel\nthat was called to the facility on the date of 07/07/2024. He stated\nhe had been called out for a youth that had climbed up on top of a\nbuilding and was threatening to jump off. Emergency Medical\nPersonnel recalled there was not a youth on top of a roof when he\narrived, but there were two youth escalated and outside of the\nbuilding with staff attending to them. He stated he turned his\nattention to a youth that was walking toward the road with staff\nnear him. This youth appeared under the influence to the medical\npersonnel. He was not responding verbally to anyone; his facial\nfeatures seemed relaxed and had a “thousand yard stare.”\nEmergency Medical Personnel recalled the youth was not\nattempting to harm himself or the staff near him. Emergency\nMedical Personnel did not believe staff were going to be able to\nstop the youth from continuing to walk off of the property He then\ngot approval from a superior to administer a sedative to the youth,\nand when Emergency Medical Personnel communicated this to\nthe staff, he was met with resistance. The staff stated to\nEmergency Medical Personnel they did not believe providing the\nsedative to the youth was necessary, and they did not believe the\nyouth was under the influence of any drugs. Emergency Medical\nPersonnel stated the staff eventually talked the youth into going\nback towards the building, and he then turned his attention to the\nother escalated youth outside. He confirmed that a sedative was\nnever provided to Youth A. Emergency Medical Personnel could\nnot recall any names of the youth or staff with which he interacted,\n2",
    "but he did confirm he had not met this youth before from other\ninteractions with the facility.\nYouth A was interviewed on 09/06/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled the incident in\nquestion and confirmed he was walking outside of the facility with\nstaff following him. Youth A could not recall why he was outside or\nwhat his state of mind was at that time. He also could not recall\nwhich staff was interacting with him and if there was law\nenforcement or medical staff present. Youth A stated he was\nnever under the influence of drugs during his time placed at the\nfacility.\nThe facility Chief Administrator was interviewed on 09/06/2024\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to the facility. In\nreviewing the incident on the date in question she confirmed that\nlaw enforcement and emergency medical personnel were called to\nthe facility to assist with Youth B after he climbed up on top of a\nroof and threatened to jump off, and that this call had nothing\nspecific to do with Youth A at that time. The Chief Administrator\nconfirmed that Youth A and Youth B were the only two youth\noutside of the building at that time.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 09/11/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled the incident in\nquestion and stated he was outside and interacted separately with\nboth Youth A and Youth B. At the time Youth A was walking\noutside of the building and was heading towards the road that is\nthe boundary of the facility’s property, but never made it that far.\nYouth A appeared to be upset, was not talking, and despite not\nlistening to requests to come back inside he was not attempting to\nhurt others or himself. Staff 1 heard one of the emergency\nmedical personnel comment they were concerned Youth A was\nunder the influence of illicit drugs. Staff 1 saw the medical\npersonnel prepare a sedative shot for Youth A. As this was\noccurring Staff 1 was attempting to verbally de-escalate Youth A,\nasking him to verbalize how he was feeling. Staff 1 recalled Youth\nA turning around to walk towards the building on his own and\nwithout staff’s physical intervention. At this point, Emergency\nMedical Personnel then turned their attention toward Youth B and\nYouth A continued to walk back inside with other staff.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone on 10/09/2024.

    "not listening to staff attempting to talk him into going back inside\nthe building. Staff 2 recalled one of the emergency medical\npersonnel stating they believed Youth A was under the influence\nof illicit drugs. Staff 2 stated back he did not believe this was the\ncase, and there was no evidence that Youth A could have\nconsumed any drugs at any point prior to this point in time. When\nStaff 2 heard the medical personnel refer to the need to administer\na sedative to Youth A, he replied back that was not going to be\nnecessary as staff could continue to attempt to verbally de-\nescalate the youth and provide line of sight supervision. Staff 2\nbelieved this recommendation came up too quickly in their\ninteractions with Youth A, and after some time Youth A began to\nwalk back to the building without incident.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone on 10/09/2024. He\nrecalled being a part of the incident in question. He stated he was\nwith Youth A as Youth A was walking the grounds of the facility\nimmediately before Youth B’s escalation. Staff 3 recalled Youth A\nbeing upset and not listening to staff interacting with him. Staff 3\ndescribed Youth A’s affect as flat, and he was crying as he walked\naround. Youth A was not attempting to harm himself or others\nand he was not verbally aggressive. Staff 3 recalled medical\npersonnel verbalizing they were prepared to administer a sedative\nto Youth A, and Staff 2 stating to them that this was not\nnecessary. Staff 3 did not hear more of that exchange because\nhe turned his attention to Youth B at that time.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Facility policy titles “Emergency and Routine\nMedical/Dental Care Policy and Procedure” last dated\n07/12/2020 was provided and reviewed. This policy stated\nthat 911 is to be contacted and youth are to be transported\nto the hospital via emergency personnel if emergency\nmedical care is needed. The policy did not provide detail\non what was to occur if emergency medical personnel are\non campus interacting with youth.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed. There was no evidence\nfound that the facility did not ensure that Youth A received\nnecessary medical services, assessing that they were able to de-\nescalate the youth without medical restraint.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n4",

This\nsecond youth was interacting with staff and law enforcement at\nthe time. Emergency Medical Personnel recalled this youth as\nvery escalated, and at one point the youth appeared to reach for\nthe firearm on one of the law enforcement officers. This caused\nlaw enforcement to restrain the youth, and the youth was\neventually placed in a soft mechanical restraint on a stretcher to\nbe transported to a local hospital by the medical staff. Emergency\nMedical Personnel confirmed that staff did not take part in these\nrestraints or transportation. Emergency Medical Personnel did\nrecall one specific staff member reacted significantly when the\nyouth did this, yelling “What the fuck are you doing!” Emergency\nMedical Personnel believed this was directed at the youth.\nEmergency Medical Personnel then addressed this staff member,\nstating to him it was inappropriate to speak to the youth in that\nmanner.

Staff 1 recalled the emergency medical personnel first\ninteracted with Youth A. Youth A was outside of the building also,\nbut not interacting with Youth B and was some distance away.\nAfter Youth A began to walk back to the building, Staff 1 recalled\nturning his attention back to Youth B, who was then interacting\nwith law enforcement and emergency medical personnel. At that\ntime the emergency medical personnel already had a stretcher\nprepared and were readying to take Youth B to the hospital to\nhave a psychiatric assessment performed. Staff 1 saw then make\na move that looked like he was trying to grab the firearm off of the\nside of one of the law enforcement officers. Staff 1 saw law\nenforcement then restrain Youth B to the ground. Staff 1 stated\nthat he yelled out to Youth B “What the fuck are you doing!” Staff\n1 recalled feeling fear and concern for what Youth B was\nattempting to do at that moment as he had been escalated and\nacting out of his normal behavior. He believed he had a good\nrapport with Youth B and was surprised by this sudden escalation\nin unsafe behavior. Staff 1 recalled one of the emergency medical\npersonnel stating back to him “Don’t yell at the kid.” Staff 1\nrecalled talking with the emergency medical personnel at that\npoint as law enforcement moved Youth B to the stretcher and\nhandcuffed him to it, then loaded him into the ambulance.\nYouth B was interviewed over the phone on 09/23/2024. He\nrecalled the incident in question. Youth B remembered getting\nupset after a church service and he eventually made his way\noutside, climbing on top of a garage roof and threatening to jump\noff.

He\nrecalled being a part of the incident in question. Staff 3 stated his\ninvolvement started with attempting to talk Youth B off of the top of\na garage where he had climbed up and threatened to jump off.\nStaff 3 stated this was successful, but Youth B was still escalated\nwhen he climbed down.
