    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth's room had holes in the wall, torn mattress, and water puddle on the floor. It is\nunknown how long the room was in this condition for. Staff member appeared\nintimidating towards youth and reported youth to be destructive, but incident reports\nhave not reflected this. There has not been treatment implemented based off this\nbehavior either. There are concerns regarding age-appropriate expectations of this\nyouth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe complaint was received on 10/05/2022, via online agency complaint.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 10/06/2022 at the facility. Staff 1 is the family transitional\ncoordinator assigned to Youth A. She is not aware of any recent incident reports\ninvolving Youth A. She reported Youth A has a history of being destructive and\npunching holes in the walls. She said the last incident report she has for Youth A is\ndated 09/15/2022, when Youth A punched the van window. She is not aware of any\nholes in the bedroom walls, or hole in the mattress. She reported the bedrooms were\npainted last weekend and maintenance was cleaning the floors. She said Youth A\nhas never expressed any concerns regarding any staff members.\nI interviewed Therapist 1 on 10/06/2022 at the facility. Therapist 1 meets weekly with\nYouth A for individual therapy, and group therapy. Therapist 1 reported Youth A has\nbeen making progress and is more engaging in therapy, but he does struggle with\nchange. In therapy she focuses on his behavior and improving impulse control. She\nsaid the beginning of the school year is a trigger for Youth A. She is not aware of\nrecent incident reports for Youth A being destructive. She said staff will document\nand report incidents involving a youth being destructive. Youth A has not reported\nany concerns regarding any issues or concerns regarding staff.\nI interviewed Youth A on 10/06/2022 at the facility. Youth A initially did not want to\ntalk or answer the questions and said that he is too embarrassed. He admitted to\nmaking a hole in the mattress and said that he usually covers the mattress so that\nstaff did not see the hole. He was asked about the water on the floor, and he again\nsaid he is “too embarrassed” and did not want to talk about it. He denied being\nintimidated by Staff 2 or having any concerns or issues with staff members. He\nreported staff help him with cleaning and organizing his room. Youth A said he has\nweekly individual and group therapy, takes his medication daily, and feels safe. He\nexpressed no issues or concerns regarding staff or the facility.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 10/06/2022 at the facility. Staff 2 is a youth specialist is\nassigned to Burnham Cottage. She is familiar with Youth A and was working 2nd shift\non 09/27/2022. Staff 2 said that she did not notice the hole in the mattress or the\nwater on the floor in Youth A’s bedroom. She said staff usually help the youths clean\n611 W. OTTAWA • P.O. BOX 30664 • LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/lara • 517-335-1980",
    "and organize their bedrooms in the evening before they go to bed. She denied any\nrecent incidents involving Youth A being destructive or damaging his bedroom. Staff\n2 said if Youth is being destructive, an incident report is completed and submitted to\nthe supervisor. She said Youth A is very messy, but staff do help and work with the\nyouths on cleaning and organizing their rooms.\nA walk-through Burnham cottage was completed on 10/06/2022. Youth A’s bedroom\nwas observed, the mattress has been replaced. There were four dime size circles on\nthe wall of the bedroom where the paint was peeled off. There were no holes in the\nwalls. The room was found to be clean, and neat. The cottage bathrooms, kitchen,\nand living room were observed and found to be clean.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Specialist via telephone on 10/10/2022. She\nreported on 09/27/2022 she picked up Youth A for an off-site visit with his sibling.\nWhen they returned to the campus, she went to Youth A’s bedroom. She observed a\npuddle of water on the floor, the mattress had a hole in it, there were clothes on\nfloor, and one wall had several areas where the paint was pealed off. She said\nYouth A told her he had flipped the mattress, so staff didn’t see it. She was\nconcerned about the tone the Staff 3 spoke with Youth A about his room being\nmessy and that he is very destructive. Foster Care Specialist said Staff 3 told her\nthat she has known Youth A for five years, which she found to be strange since\nYouth A has only been at the facility for 2 years.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 10/12/2022 at the facility. Staff 3 is a youth specialist and\nhas been working at the facility for 5 years. She reported no disciplinary\nactions/reports. Staff 3 was working 2nd shift on 09/27/2022 and recalls the incident\ninvolving Youth A. She denied previously seeing the hole in Youth A’s mattress or\nthe water on the floor. Staff 3 said Youth does have a history of being destructive,\nbut she was not aware of any recent incidents. She admitted to talking to Youth A,\nabout him being destructive, but denied that her tone was intimidating. She said staff\nhelp Youth A clean and organize his bedroom daily. Staff usually will go and check\nyouth’s rooms before they go to bed and help them fold their clothes and clean the\nroom. She tries to always be positive and motivate all the youths when addressing\nany issues or concerns. She said staff will document and complete incident reports\nwhenever there are any incidents involving the youths. She said Youth A was not in\nthe cottage when she arrived for her shift and so staff did not have a reason to go to\nhis room. Staff 3 denied saying she has known Youth A for five years. She told\nYouth A’s foster care worker that she has worked at the facility for five years. She\nsaid they helped Youth A clean his room that night and replaced his mattress.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility on 10/12/2012. He has been working at the\nfacility for almost two years and is the Supervisor for Burnham Cottage. Supervisor 1\nreported all the youths got new beds and mattresses in August. He said staff were\nnot aware of the hole in the mattress or the water on the floor. He reported the\ncottage had been painted the weekend before this incident and maintenance was\ncleaning the floors the day before this incident. He said staff help all the youths clean\n611 W.
