She reported while\nthey were sitting at the table together, he was using his finger to\ngo in circles up her leg from her knee to her thigh, while her leg\nwas under the table. Youth A reported there was no one else\nsitting at the table or anywhere near them, so no one saw\nanything. Youth A reported she jerked her leg away and went to\nthe corner of the milieu to get away from him. Youth A reported\nStaff 1 followed her because she was on 1:1 supervision and staff\nmust be within arm’s length of her.

Youth C reported a couple\ndays later, Youth A reported Staff 1 got fired because they took\nYouth A’s clothes, tested them, and found “boy stuff” on them.\nYouth C reported she thought it was weird because she knows\nYouth A from another facility, and Youth A made similar\nallegations about a male staff at that facility too. Youth C reported\nthese allegations are not true and she’s upset they were made\nbecause they could ruin Staff 1’s life, which is not fair. Youth C\nreported she was present on the day in question.

Youth C\nreported Staff 1 wasn’t sitting next to Youth A at the table and was\nnever close enough to Youth A to touch her. Youth C reported\nStaff 1 was sitting in a green chair he had pulled up to the table,\nwhich was at the opposite end of where Youth A was sitting.\nChief Administrator (CA)/Therapist was interviewed face to\nface at the facility on 2/6/24 in conjunction with MDHHS\nWorker.

Staff 1 reported eventually\nYouth A got up from the table and sat on the floor by the door\nleading outside of the unit, so he sat approximately 5-10 feet away\nfrom her, so she didn’t feel backed into a corner. Staff 1 reported,\nas a rule, he never initiates any physical contact with youth, other\nthan the occasional fist bump. Staff 1 reported when he is a 1:1\nstaff member, he makes sure he is observing the youth, but\n3",
    "doesn’t want to make them feel uncomfortable or like they’re\nunder a microscope because it can escalate them further.

Staff 1 reported he\nnever looked at her private parts, and never made any physical\ncontact with her of any sort.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 2/21/24 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported she initially heard about\nthe allegations because she overheard Youth A telling her foster\ncare worker about the allegations during a phone call. Staff 2 was\nsurprised Youth A would say those things because none of it was\ntrue. Staff 2 reported she was Youth A’s 1:1 staff member on\n2/4/24 but asked Staff 1 to take over so she could complete\npaperwork. Staff 2 reported she was still on the milieu and\nobserving everything going on while she was completing\npaperwork. Staff 2 reported she was still watching Youth A intently\nbecause Youth A self-harms so easily, and Staff 2 wanted to\nmake sure she was ready to respond if anything happened. Staff 2\nreported Youth A was sitting by the entrance door with Youth B\nand Youth D watching a video on her tablet and Staff 1 was sitting\n2 doors down from her on her right side. Staff 2 noted Staff 1 was\nnot able to look at her private parts or touch her from where he\nwas sitting. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was never alone with Youth A,\nnever sat next to her at a table and wasn’t ever close enough to\nYouth A to touch her.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 2/21/24 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 reported he was working the day in\nquestion. Staff 4 reported he didn’t remember Staff 1 sitting at a\ntable while they were working.

Staff 4\nreported while he was present, he doesn’t remember seeing Staff\n1 close to Youth A or interact with her.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Close Observation Log for Youth A dated 2/4/24 notes Staff\n1 was her 1:1 staff member from approximately 2:54 pm to\n3:35 pm.\n• Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services Standards for\nStaff-Client Relationships Policy states any relationship\nwith a person served that is non-professional in nature is\nnot acceptable, which includes any type of sexual\nrelationship. Staff members shall not take advantage of a\nperson served for personal benefit.\n4",
    "• Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary records in his\nemployee file. Staff 1 completed New Employee Orientation\n(policies for the facility) on 5/22/23, Trauma Informed Care\ntraining on 6/13/23, and Orientation to Recipient Rights on\n6/20/23.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. There is no evidence to support the\nallegations. Youth A reported she and Staff 1 were alone at the\ntable together when the alleged incident occurred. However, Staff\n1, Staff 2, and Youth C all report Staff 1 was never alone at the\ntable with Youth A and was never close enough to touch her.\nCONSULTATION:\n• Youth A disclosed it’s very easy to find things in the milieu\nto self-harm with. For example, she said when the floor is\nswept, pieces of glass or rocks end up along the wall. It is\nrecommended this is a focus area for additional cleaning.\n• Youth A also disclosed she is very sneaky when staff\nmembers assist her in getting personal items out of her\ncubby. CA/Therapist noted they no longer allow Youth A to\nhave access to getting items, and staff are required to get\nthe items for her.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nFebruary 29, 2024\nShannon Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 4, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
