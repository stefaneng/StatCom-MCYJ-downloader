Facility did not notify anyone about issues with filling this until\nthe last minute.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on February 17, 2022. Youth A\nstated she was without Prazosin for about one week in January. Youth A reported\n2",
    "she was told by staff her insurance expired. Youth A stated she is receiving her\nPrazosin now and it has not been an issue since the end of January. Youth A\ndenied running out of medication any other time while at the facility.\nStaff 1 and Case Manager were interviewed separately, face to face at the facility on\nFebruary 17, 2022. They both stated Youth A’s foster care worker was on vacation\nwhen the insurance became inactive, and they had to wait for the foster care worker\nto return in order to fix the insurance issue. Case Manager reported she did not\nattempt to call the foster care worker supervisor as she did not have the supervisor’s\nphone number.\nMDHHS Foster Care Worker and I exchanged emails on February 18, 2022,\nregarding Youth A not receiving her Prazosin. MDHHS Foster Care Worker wrote:\n01/18/2022 I was notified Youth A’s medication was out by New Hope Case\nManager in an email, and that they had gone through the reserves at the pharmacy.\nThis was the first I was notified, not any time prior. On 01/19/2022, I was explained it\nwas due to an insurance issue by Case Manager. I then notified my Health Liaison\nOfficer (HLO) right away to resolve the insurance issues. She did, and I then\nprovided contact information between the New Hope case manager and the HLO, so\nif there were any further issues the HLO could assist. This insurance issue was not\nan issue prior to the incident.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n Youth Opportunity Center for Success and Independence Policies and\nProcedures; Administration of Medication: correct documentation of a missed\nmedication and notification procedures.\n Email correspondence between MDHHS Foster Care Worker, New Hope\nCaseworker, New Hope Medical Technician, and MDHHS Health Liaison\nOfficer between January 12 – 28, 2022 detailing insurance inactive, running\nout of Prazosin, to purchase the Prazosin and save the receipt to be\nreimbursed and that the insurance was now active.\n January Medication Administration Record (MAR) documenting from January\n16 – January 21, 2022, Youth A did not receive her Prazosin.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\n3",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is found in noncompliance as Youth A was without\nPrazosin from January 16 – 21, 2022. Youth A’s insurance was\ninactive. In an email the Health Liaison Officer wrote that the\nprescription could be filled and once the insurance is active the\nreceipt could be taken back to the filling pharmacy and rerun\nthrough Medicaid so a refund could be issued.\nVIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, in conjunction with the recommendation\nof SIR 2022C0128019, a first provisional license is recommended.\nMarch 7, 2022\n________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 7, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
