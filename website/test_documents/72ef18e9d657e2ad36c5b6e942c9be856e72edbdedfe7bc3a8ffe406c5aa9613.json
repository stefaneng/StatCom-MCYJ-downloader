Foster Care Supervisor stated they\ndiscussed the situation with the foster parents of Youth A. The\nfoster parents reported Youth A was at the fair and another family\nwas there with children who were friends with Youth A, so Youth A\nwas allowed to spend some time with them and go on some rides\nwith them.
