EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans during this\nlicensing period:\nThe first corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2023 Renewal inspection\nwhere it received 10 rule violations.\nDuring this current Interim inspection, the agency received 15 rule violations. This\nwas an increase of 5 from the Renewal inspection. Of these 15 citations, 7 are\nrepeat violations from the Renewal inspection. The agency’s corrective action plan\ncompliance around these 7 rule violations is as follows: the number of individual\ncases cited remained basically the same with respect to 3 rule violations cited;\nthere was decreases related to 2 other rule violations cited (from 4 of 4 to 3 of 4 for\nboth); and the number of individual cases cited with respect to the last 2 rule\nviolations cited increased (from 1 of 4 to 4 of 4 for both).\n8",
    "The agency was able to implement some aspect of its corrective action plan such\nas the development of a quarterly audit tool, spreadsheet for performance\nevaluations and training for staff on independent living discharge documentation. It\nwas not effective in completion of monthly file audits or the hiring of a new case\nworker. And as illustrated by its repeat violations, it was not totally successful with\nthe corrective action. Also given its current situation around staffing, maintaining\nconsistent compliance around all areas, could be challenging. They reported they\nare trying to hire case workers but are experiencing difficulty.\nThe second corrective action plan for special investigation 2024SIC00001069\nrelated to a complaint investigation initiated on 1/19/2024. The complaint alleged\nthe agency refused to work with the child’s parent, failed to ensure the child had\naccess to food, failed to document independent skills, and to obtain the child’s state\nID. The special investigation did not substantiate those allegations, but the agency\nwas found in violations of R400.12418(2)(b) for having a late service plan. The\nagency submitted an acceptable corrective action that was approved on 3/14/2024.\nThe corrective action plan indicated the agency would complete a training with staff\naround service plans; and it would maintain compliance by way of the supervisor\nconducting monthly supervision with workers and completing monthly audits. The\nagency completed the stated training and was having regular monthly meeting with\nstaff. The agency was not successful with completion of monthly case audit. It is\nrevisiting this action step to look at quarterly case audits once case workers are\nhired. It hopes to have a worker in place by the end of March 2025.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 10/4/2024, where it\nindicated timely documentation continued to be of issue due to a lack of motivated\nstaff. The chief administrator reported keeping a consistent staffing team is key to\nperformance improvement and the agency would continue to strive to achieve a\nsolid team. The chief administrator reported the agency had improved its\ncompletion of service plan reports and the use of checklists and training of the\nprogram manager aided with this improvement. The reported indicated that a\nquality team meets to ensure the agency is providing services as required by\npolicy standards.\nThe agency must continue to work to hire staff and to ensure it is working to fulfill\nthe action steps it indicated in its corrective action plan.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a 2025 annual budget, and the agency’s last annual\nindependent financial audit for 12/31/2023. A review of the documents did not\nreveal any noticeable areas of concern.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to discussion with the licensee designee, chief administrator, and\nhuman resource manager at the entrance and exit conference, I interviewed two\n9",
    "youth advocates, and the youth advocate supervisor. The staff persons\ninterviewed all reported staff try to work together to aid the youths in achieving\ngoals, that the licensee designee and chief administrator both check on the youths\nin the program and check on and aid them as well. An area of growth indicated\nrelated to obtaining more support resources for youths, helping new staff to\nrecognize the difficulties of the job and gaining an appreciation about the fact that\nthey are dealing with the lives of young people.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency satellite office at 19992 Kelly Rd. in Harper Woods,\nthat houses the agency’s administrative office showed renovation occurring by the\nbuilding management. The agency reported the building was purchased by new\nmanagement, and their lease at the building will end at the end of February. The\nagency reported it has obtained a new office space on at 22100 Kelly Rd, in\nHarper Woods MI and it will move there soon.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNot applicable. This is an independent living program.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan modification of the agency’s\nlicense from a regular license to a first provisional license is recommended.\nFebruary 14, 2025\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 02, 2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n10"
