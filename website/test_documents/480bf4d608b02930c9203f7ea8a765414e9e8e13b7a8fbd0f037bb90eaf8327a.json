Supervisor 1 reported she heard the\nallegations from Supervisor 2. Supervisor 1 reported she spoke\nwith Staff 3 about the allegations on 9/14/23 and Staff 3 admitted\nto pushing Youth A backwards and telling Youth A to “never do\nthat again” in reference to Youth A scaring him. Supervisor 1\nreported Staff 3 also laughed and said, “I would never shoot him”.\nSupervisor 1 reported she reviewed video footage and then called\nin a complaint. Supervisor 1 reported she didn’t talk directly to\nYouth A about the situation. Supervisor 1 told Staff 3 on 9/15/23\nhe was on leave until further notice. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 3\nused to be a youth at the facility and sometimes can show a lack\nof professionalism. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 3 seems aware of\nhis own triggers and responses, but sometimes can be aggressive\nin his verbal tone towards youth.\n2",
    "Supervisor 2 was interviewed via phone on 9/29/23. Supervisor\n2 reported Staff 1 told him Youth A disclosed to her about Staff 3\nthreatening to “shoot” Youth A. Supervisor 2 did not speak with\nStaff 3 or Youth A directly about the allegations. Supervisor 2\nreported Staff 3 can be a “hot head”. Supervisor 2 reported Staff 3\ncan be disrespectful to the youth in the home and antagonizes the\nyouth if they separate themselves from him as he will continue to\nfollow them.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 9/27/23. Staff 1 reported\nshe was driving Youth A to school one day (couldn’t remember\nwhich day) and Youth A nonchalantly reported Staff 3 stated he\nwas going to shoot him. Staff 1 reported she told Youth A “don’t\njoke like that, it’s not funny” and Youth A assured her he wasn’t\njoking. Staff 1 reported she told Supervisor 2 about the situation\nand Supervisor 2 instructed her to follow-up and get more details\nwhen Youth A was home from school. Staff 1 spoke with Youth A\nlater that day and Youth A told her he was walking into the kitchen\nand jokingly scared Staff 3. Youth A told Staff 1, Staff 3 turned\naround and told him “You know if we were outside, I would have\nshot you”. Staff 1 reported she was unaware Staff 3 pushed Youth\nA. Staff 1 reported there have been a few times when she’s been\nconcerned with Staff 3’s interactions with the youth because some\nof the things he says are insulting or unprofessional and are things\nan adult in this role should never say to a child. Staff 1 reported\nshe has never witnessed Staff 3 be verbally or aggressive towards\nany youth. Staff 1 reported since March/April 2023, whenever\nshe’s seen Staff 3 on the schedule, she knows it’s going to be a\nrough afternoon. Staff 1 reported Staff 3’s behavior hasn’t\nimproved since then and it seems like Staff 3 hates his job, so he\ntakes it out on the youth. Staff 1 reported she has expressed\nthese concerns to Supervisor 2 before and she believes they’ve\nbeen addressed.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/27/23.\nStaff 2 reported she did not witness the incident. Staff 2 reported\nshe was driving Youth A to work one day (not sure which day) and\nYouth A was talking about his disdain for Staff 3. Staff 2 reported\nYouth A said Staff 3 pushed him. Staff 2 asked Youth A if it was\nfunny banter or something serious and Youth A said it was\nserious. Staff 2 reported Youth A told her he went in the kitchen to\nspook Staff 3 to be funny. Youth A reported Staff 3 turned around\nand said, “if this happened on the streets, I would shoot you” and\nthen Staff 3 pushed Youth A. Staff 2 encouraged Youth A to speak\nto Supervisor 1 about the situation, but he didn’t seem like he\nwanted to, so Staff 2 reported it to Supervisor 1 instead. Staff 2\n3",
    "reported once or twice Staff 3 has cussed in front of the youth,\nwhich she doesn’t feel is professional, but she hasn’t seen any\nother inappropriate interactions.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/27/23.\nStaff 3 reported he was cooking for youth and staff when Youth A\ncame up behind him, touched him and yelled. Staff 3 reported he\nwas frightened, and in response, he pushed Youth A with little to\nno force and said, “get away from me, I don’t like this stuff”. Staff 3\nreported he pushed Youth A to create space between them\nbecause Staff 3 was in a corner. Staff 3 reported he couldn’t\nremember what else either of them said to each other. He\nreported he never told Youth A he was going to shoot him. He\nreported the youth sometimes do some inappropriate things when\nthey’re in the community (i.e., cat calling women on the street,\nflipping middle fingers at cars driving by, etc.) and one time he told\nall the youth “This is America and you never know who has a gun,\nso if you keep acting that way, you might get shot”. He reported he\nsaid this out of concern for their safety and ensuring they\nunderstood the realities of living in America. He said he couldn’t\nremember when he said it, but it wasn’t the day of the incident.\nStaff 3 reported he could have removed himself from the situation\nwith Youth A, but he was focused on cooking and wanted to finish.\nStaff 3 reported he has told the youth many times to not get close\nto him, not to touch him and requested they respect his personal\nbubble, but they don’t listen. Staff 3 reported he feels he is\ngenerally not respected by some of the youth, which could be a\nrapport issue, and he’s trying to fix it. Staff 3 reported some of the\nyouth comment negatively on his height, his hand size, and his\nbody, which are signs of disrespect to him. Staff 3 reported he\ntries to correct them, but they don’t want to be corrected. Staff 3\nreported he has never had any verbal or physical altercations or\nconfrontations with other youth before.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/27/23.\nStaff 4 reported he was working with Staff 3 on 9/6/23 when the\nincident occurred, but he did not see or hear what happened\nbetween Youth A and Staff 3. Staff 4 reported Staff 3 told him after\nthe interaction Staff 3 pushed Youth A because Youth A scared\nhim.\nInterpreter was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n9/27/23. Interpreter was in the kitchen at the time of the incident\nand saw Youth A scare Staff 3. Interpreter reported he saw Staff 3\npush Youth A, but felt it was a natural reaction from being scared.\nInterpreter reported he could not tell if the push was serious or\n4",
    "playful in nature. Interpreter reported he could not remember\nanything Youth A or Staff 3 said during the interaction. Interpreter\nreported he did not hear Staff 3 say anything about shooting\nYouth A, but admitted he was not paying close attention.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/27/23.\nYouth A reported on 9/6/23, he went into the kitchen while Staff 3\nwas cooking. He went next to Staff 3 and made a loud noise to\njokingly scare Staff 3. Youth A reported Staff 3 turned around and\npushed him. Then after a minute or so, Staff 3 said “If you were\noutside, I would have shot you with a gun”. Youth A reported Staff\n3 was very aggressive and was serious when he pushed Youth A\nand talked about shooting him. Youth A reported he felt insecure\nand unsafe with Staff 3 during and after the interaction. Youth A\nreported there have been multiple situations when Staff 3 has\nbeen verbally aggressive towards youth in the home by yelling or\ncussing at them, but he hasn’t seen Staff 3 be physical with any\nother youth.\nVIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED:\nVideo footage of 9/6/23 was reviewed. It should be noted the\nvideo footage does not have any audio. It should also be noted\nYouth B is in the kitchen during the incident; however, he is facing\naway from the incident and has his headphones in. Therefore, he\nwas not interviewed.\nStaff 3 is standing in front of the oven in the kitchen facing the\nwall. Interpreter is standing in front of the refrigerator, which is\nlocated behind Staff 3’s position. Youth A is seen walking through\nthe milieu and entering the kitchen. He walks past Interpreter and\napproaches Staff 3. Staff 3 turns around quickly and faces Youth\nA. They exchange words and then after a few seconds, Staff 3\nuses his right hand, puts it on Youth A’s chest and forcefully\nshoves Youth A backwards. Staff 3 then walks to the refrigerator\nand Youth A is seen behind him talking to him. Staff 3 turns\naround and exchanges words with Youth A. While they’re\nexchanging words, Staff 4 enters the kitchen and begins speaking\nto them. Staff 3 then resumes cooking at the stove.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Bethany Employee Handbook states physical or verbal\nharassment, violence, abuse, threats, or intimidation are\nprohibited.\n5",
    "• Bethany Christian Services Emergency Restraint Policy\nand Procedures states pushing a youth on any part of their\nbody and threats towards youth are prohibited.\n• Facility Incident report states Youth A notified Staff 1 of the\nallegations, who then told Supervisor 1. Supervisor 1 notes\nshe spoke with Staff 3, who admitted to pushing Youth A.\n• Bethany Christian Services Safety Plan regarding Staff 3\ndated 9/20/23 states the purpose is to identify steps for\nimmediate and ongoing coaching and development of Staff\n3 to reinforce expectations and promote active\nimplementation of appropriate boundaries, conversation,\nand professionalism related to interactions with clients.\n• Staff 3 has one disciplinary record in his employee file\nunrelated to this investigation. He has one performance\ncoaching document in his file related to this investigation\ndated 9/30/23. Staff 3 completed CPI training on 6/7/23.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted, video footage reviewed, and\ndocumentation reviewed there is evidence to show Staff 3 pushed\nYouth A during an interaction in the kitchen of the facility on\n9/6/23.\nThere is no evidence to support Staff 3 threatened to shoot Youth\nA. Staff 3 reported in a separate interaction on a separate date\ninvolving multiple youth, he warned them not to act in certain ways\nin public because they don’t know who has a gun and might shoot\nthem. Staff 3 reported he never stated he or anyone from the\nfacility would shoot any of the youth and was simply stating a\ngeneral warning of concern for youth safety in the community.\nYouth A maintains Staff 3 threatened to shoot him. However, none\nof the other witnesses to the verbal interaction on 9/6/23 can\nconfirm what was or wasn’t said.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of Staff\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\n6",
    "Allegation Staff 1 and Staff 2 did not stop a fight between two youth at the\nfacility.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via phone on 9/29/23. Supervisor\n2 reported there was an altercation between Youth B and Youth C\non 9/6/23. Supervisor 2 reported Staff 3 watched the fight between\nthe two youth and never tried to intervene or separate them.\nSupervisor 2 reported Staff 4 attempted to intervene and separate\nthem but was unable to without assistance. Supervisor 2 reported\nother youth in the facility ultimately split up Youth B and Youth C.\nSupervisor 2 reported after the two youth were separated, they\nended up engaging in a second fight and, once again, Staff 3\nfailed to intervene.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via phone on 10/2/23. Supervisor\n1 reported she was not present, but she has incident reports of the\naltercation between Youth B and Youth C on 9/6/23. Supervisor\nreported Staff 3 did not intervene in the fight. Supervisor 1\nreported Staff 4 attempted to intervene but was unsuccessful.\nSupervisor 1 reported she spoke with Staff 3 and Staff 4 about\ntaking action when needed because they are CPI trained and\nneed to utilize CPI techniques. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 3 did\nnot take ownership of his lack of action but was receptive to\nfeedback. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 3 stated “yeah, I\nunderstand. I was in a bad headspace that day and I realize I\nshould have done something, but I can’t take it back”. Supervisor\n1 reported Staff 3 also stated “Well [Youth C] was talking smack\nand kind of deserved it”. Supervisor 1 reported she provided the\ninformation regarding the incident to Human Resources, and they\ndid not do anything further because they were going to combine\nall concerns on 9/6/23 in the same written warning and were\nwaiting for this investigation to be completed prior to proceeding.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 10/3/23. Staff 3 reported\nYouth B and Youth C were fighting and choking each other. Staff\n3 reported his mindset was “okay let them finish this fight really\nquick, and if they don’t stop after a minute, I’ll call the police”. Staff\n3 reported Staff 4 attempted to help by separating them, but it\ndidn’t work. Staff 3 reported between him and Staff 4, they\nwouldn’t have been able to do anything because Youth B and\nYouth C were stronger and taller than them. Staff 3 reported he\nhas never used CPI before, but he has been trained in CPI; most\nrecently in June 2023. Staff 3 reported he practiced the restraint\nand de-escalation skills during training but doesn’t feel\ncomfortable using them. Staff 3 reported training once per year for\na few hours is not enough time or frequency to maintain learning\n7",
    "the skills when they’re not used often. Staff 3 stated “I just work\nhere. I don’t want to get hurt or accidently hurt someone else. I\nfeel it’s completely justified not to put my hands on someone else.\nI have no intention of using CPI restraints unless necessary and I\ndidn’t feel it was necessary”. Staff 3 reported he felt CPI wouldn’t\nsuffice in the situation, so he yelled “I’m going to call the police”\nloudly and then they stopped fighting. Staff 3 reported the situation\nwas very dangerous and he felt Youth B nor Youth C would be in\nthe mindset to be separated. Staff 3 reported once the boys were\nseparated the first time, he wasn’t thinking, so he didn’t attempt to\nget any of the youth to leave the scene. Staff 3 reported if he\ncould change one thing about his actions, he would have cleared\nthe scene when the first fight was over.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 10/4/23. Staff 4 reported\nYouth B and Youth C ran out of the house and began physically\nfighting on the lawn. Staff 4 reported he tried to break them up, but\nStaff 3 made no attempt to help. Staff 4 reported he was\nunsuccessful in breaking up the fight because the two youth kept\nfighting by slapping each other. Staff 4 reported had Staff 3\ncontained one youth and Staff 4 contained the other youth, they\ncould have separated them easily. Staff 4 reported when he asked\nStaff 3 to get one of the youth, Staff 3 replied he didn’t want to be\ninvolved. Staff 4 reported after he was unsuccessful in separating\nYouth B and Youth C, other youth jumped in and helped pull them\napart, which Staff 4 was thankful for. Staff 4 reported he felt alone\nin the situation. Staff 4 reported he was trying to de-escalate\nYouth B and Youth C the entire time by asking them to stop and\nexplaining why it wasn’t okay. Staff 4 reported Staff 3 repeated\n“stop fighting” but that was all he said to attempt to de-escalate\nthe situation.\nVIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED:\nVideo footage of 9/6/23 directly outside of the facility was\nreviewed. It should be noted the video footage does not have any\naudio. Youth B and Youth C exit the facility, with Staff 3, Staff 4\nand the other youth behind them. Youth B and Youth C begin\nphysically fighting with each other outside of the facility. Staff 4\nwalks towards them slowly and then tries to intervene by putting\nhimself in between them. When that doesn’t work, he backs off\nand watches with his hands in his pockets. Youth D and another\nyouth (can’t tell from the camera who due to it being dark, so\nidentified as Unknown Youth) separate Youth B and Youth C.\nStaff 3 watches and makes no effort to intervene or separate the\nyouth. Youth C, Youth D, Staff 3, Staff 4, and the rest of the youth\nstand in a group conversing, while Youth B struggles to get away\n8",
    "from Unknown Youth’s hold on him. Finally, after Youth B and\nUnknown Youth walk around a bit, Youth B is released, and they\nbegin walking towards the group. Youth B begins to head towards\nYouth C and Staff 4 steps in front of him and puts his hand on\nYouth C’s chest to block him from moving forward. They begin to\nwalk side by side towards the door to enter the facility. Then Youth\nC goes behind Staff 3, comes around Staff 3’s left side and\npunches Youth B. Staff 4 tries to grab onto Youth B or Youth C,\nbut the momentum of them fighting caused Staff 4 to be\nunsuccessful. Youth B and Youth C continue to fight while\neveryone, including Staff 3 and Staff 4, watch. Youth B and Youth\nC are on the ground fighting and the camera angle is blocked by\nsome trees/shrubbery, so you can only see everyone watching\nthem fight. Staff 4 finally bends down to their level. Youth B and\nYouth C both get up and separate. Staff 4 stands in front of Youth\nC in attempts to block him from going after Youth B again. Youth\nC avoids him and begins to jog around the group. Staff 4 then\nstands in front of Youth B and faces Youth C to attempt to stop\nfurther altercations. As Youth C continues to jog around, Staff 4\ncontinues to change his angle, so he is always in between Youth\nB and Youth C. Then everyone re-enters the facility.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident Report dated 9/6/23 authored by Supervisor 1\ntitled “Assault toward a peer” outlines what happened prior\nto Youth B and Youth C going outside to fight. Incident\nreport notes “Many other clients witnessed the fight and two\nclients intervened by pulling [Youth B] and [Youth C] off\neach other. [Staff 3] and [Staff 4] were present, however,\nwere not engaging in physical interventions, but attempted\nto verbally de-escalate the situation”.\n• Bethany Christian Servies Emergency Restraint Policy and\nProcedures states physical intervention should only be\nused after de-escalation has been attempted and for the\nfollowing reasons: prevent serious injury to resident,\nprevent injury to other and prevent escape where resident\nmay be at risk of injury to others.\n• Bethany Christian Services TLC Policy and Procedure:\nStaff Conduct and Expectations states staff shall follow all\nsafety rules and practices.\n• Bethany Employee Handbook states failing or neglecting\nessential duties, client management rules and procedures,\nor company policies are prohibited.\n9",
    "• Bethany Christian Services Safety Plan regarding Staff 3\ndated 9/20/23 states the purpose is to identify steps for\nimmediate and ongoing coaching and development of Staff\n3 to reinforce expectations and promote active\nimplementation of appropriate boundaries, conversation,\nand professionalism related to interactions with clients.\n• Staff 3 has one disciplinary record in his employee file\nunrelated to this investigation. He has one performance\ncoaching document in his file related to this investigation\ndated 9/30/23. Staff 3 completed CPI training on 6/7/23.\n• Staff 4 does not have any disciplinary records in his\nemployee file. Staff 4 completed CPI training on 6/7/23.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted, documentation reviewed, and\nvideo footage reviewed, this violation is established. Staff 3 and\nStaff 4 watched Youth B and Youth C fight and did not properly\nintervene as they did not utilize their training in CPI to keep Youth\nB and Youth C from hurting each other.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2022C0103011 dated 4/29/22; CAP approved 5/18/22\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4128 Initial staff training and ongoing training\nSection (5) An employee shall not participate in restraining a resident or\nDescription placing a resident in seclusion prior to receiving training on those\ntopics. The training model shall be approved, in writing, by the\ndepartment.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Facility has been utilizing and training staff on a restraint policy not\napproved by the Department.\nInvestigation During review of the restraint policy Supervisor sent to Consultant,\nit was discovered the policy was not most recent policy approved\nby DCWL in July 2022. When asked, Supervisor reported the\napproved policy was sent to staff on 7/11/22 and a team meeting\nwas held the same month to train staff on the policy. However, the\npolicy was never put into their shared drive. Therefore, all staff\nhired after the email was sent and the training occurred, have\nbeen trained on old policy. In addition, the old policy was the only\none staff had access to in order to refresh their skills on an\nongoing basis.\n10",
    "DOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Bethany Christian Servies TLC Policy and Procedure:\nPhysical Restraints (rev. 9/12/23) is the policy old. It was\nrevised by the facility’s quality assurance team in\nSeptember 2023 because it was still located in the facility’s\nshared drive.\n• Bethany Christian Services Emergency Physical Restraint\nPolicy and Procedures (rev. 8/10/22) is the policy approved\nby the Department.\nAnalysis Based on documentation reviewed and information received from\nSupervisor, this violation is established. The facility has been\ntraining staff and operating based on an outdate restraint policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nOctober 19, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 20, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"
