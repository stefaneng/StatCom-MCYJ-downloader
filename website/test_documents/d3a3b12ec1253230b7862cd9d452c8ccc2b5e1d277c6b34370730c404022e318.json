    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe addendum is to describe the facility’s change in license type from child caring\ninstitution to children’s therapeutic group home.\nIII. Methodology\n05/12/10 Received written request from licensee to change the license to a\nchildren’s therapeutic group home.\n05/14/10 Consultant met with the licensee, the chief administrator, and staff\nregarding the statutory criteria for licensure as a children’s therapeutic group home.\nThe consultant observed that the behavior management room has been converted\nto a storage closet, to be used for extra clothing, bedding, and residents’ personal\nitems.\n05/14/10 Received documentation from the licensee and chief administrator\nindicating that all policies and procedures relating to the use of seclusion and\nrestraint/physical management have been removed from the program. New policy\nhas been implemented.\n05/19/10 License type changed from child caring institution to children’s\ntherapeutic group home.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe facility has submitted written documentation, indicating that all policies and\nprocedures related to the use of seclusion and restraint/physical management have\nbeen removed from the program. A newly developed “Hand’s Off” policy was\nsubmitted, and has been implemented. This policy indicates that no form of\nseclusion and/or restraint/physical management may be used at the facility. The\npolicy further states that the department will be notified of any instance of the use of\na physical intervention, using the statutory definition of personal restraint. The\nconsultant met with the licensee, chief administrator, and child care staff on 05/12/10\nto explain the statutory criteria for a children’s therapeutic group home, at which time\nit was observed that the behavior management room has been converted to a\nstorage closet.\n2",
