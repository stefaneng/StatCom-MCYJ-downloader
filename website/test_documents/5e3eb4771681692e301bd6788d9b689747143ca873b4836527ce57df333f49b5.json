She stated parental rights for Youth A’s parents were\nterminated at the end of April 2025 and she would like to be\nconsidered for adoptive placement. Maternal Grandmother stated\nBiological Mother was residing with her at the time Youth A was\nremoved so she was not able to take placement. In addition, she\nhad some housing issues that needed to be addressed, and her\nboyfriend was not in support of Youth A being placed there. She\nstated she spoke with Foster Care worker (FCW) sometime at the\nend of March 2025 indicating she would like placement of Youth A\nbut she didn’t have any family support. FCW indicated it was\nnever too late if she wanted to move forward with being\nconsidered for placement.\nShe stated Biological Mother reported FCW made a comment to\nher while at court for the termination hearing indicating it was too\nlate for Maternal Grandmother to be considered for placement.\nShe stated current caregivers already planned to adopt Youth A\nand there is a strong attachment between them.\nShe stated FCW contacted her recently and informed her\nsomeone from an adoption agency would be contacting her to\ngather information in order to assess her for possible adoptive\nplacement.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nMay 21, 2025. She stated she has been the assigned worker\nsince October 2024. FCW stated at the time she was assigned,\nMaternal Grandmother was very forthcoming and indicated she\nwas not able to care for Youth A due to her work schedule, lack of\nsupport and, primarily because Youth A’s parents were residing\nwith her. FCW stated she was informed Maternal Grandmother\nwas contacted at the time Youth A was removed in March 2024\nand had indicated she was not able to take placement at that time\nfor similar reasons. FCW stated other relative options were\nexplored early on in the case but either were not interested or\nwere not appropriate for placement of Youth A.\n2",
    "FCW stated she spoke with Maternal Grandmother early April\n2025. There was discussion about placement of Youth A. FCW\nstated she would pass her information along to the assigned\nadoption agency if Maternal Grandmother was interested in\nplacement. She stated there was another discussion with Maternal\nGrandmother on April 25, 2025, after the termination hearing took\nplace and Youth A’s parents released their parental rights. During\nthat conversation, FCW stated she explained again she would\nprovide her information to the assigned adoption agency so they\ncould assess her for possible adoptive placement.\nFCW stated she explained to Maternal Grandmother that Youth A\nhas been in her current placement for over a year and is bonded\nwith them but clarified she never told her she wouldn’t be\nconsidered for placement or that it was too late in the process to\nbe considered. She stated she was clear with Maternal\nGrandmother the adoption agency would assess any competing\nparty and make the decision.\nFCW stated during conversations with Youth A’s parents they\nspecifically stated they did not want Youth A to be placed with\nMaternal Grandmother. There were concerns regarding Maternal\nGrandmother being able to meet Youth A’s needs and Youth A is\nbonded to current caregivers.\nFoster Care supervisor (FC supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on May 28, 2025. He stated FCW previously reached\nout to Maternal Grandmother to inquire if she was interested in\npossible placement of Youth A and she wasn’t able to take her at\nthat time. He stated Maternal Grandmother had contacted FCW to\ninquire about placement mid-April 2025 and that was just prior to\nBiological Mother’s releasing her parental rights during a court\nhearing on April 22, 2025. He stated the agency felt it was best to\nallow the assigned adoption agency to assess Maternal\nGrandmother and any other interested parties since the\ntermination hearing was scheduled for the following week. He\nstated they didn’t want to move Youth A and cause any\nunnecessary trauma. FC supervisor stated an adoption agency\nhas been assigned and notified that Maternal Grandmother has\nexpressed interest in potential adoptive placement. The adoption\nagency has indicated they will assess Maternal Grandmother.\nBiological Mother was interviewed via telephone on May 28,\n2025. She stated Youth A has been in the same placement with\nunrelated licensed caregivers since she was 3 months old. She\nstated just prior to her releasing her parental rights, Maternal\n3",
    "Grandmother expressed interest in placement of Youth A. She\nstated she reported to both Maternal Grandmother and FCW she\ndidn’t think that was a good idea because Youth A was\ncomfortable and bonded with her current placements.\nDuring the last court hearing when Biological Mother released her\nparental rights she stated FCW hinted, but did not directly state,\nMaternal Grandmother would be unlikely to obtain placement and\nit was too late in the process. She was asked to elaborate on what\nshe meant by hinted but was unable to provide an example or any\nother details. Biological Mother stated she expressed concern to\nFCW regarding Maternal Grandmother obtaining placement of\nYouth A due to her work schedule, ongoing household\nresponsibilities and not being realistic about what it would take to\nraise Youth A and meet her needs. Biological Mother reported\nMaternal Grandmother has previously informed her FCW told her\nshe could be an option for placement. FCW reported to Biological\nMother the adoption worker will access anyone who expresses\ninterest in potential adoptive placement.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A’s MISACWIS case file. April 11, 2025, social\nwork contact: Maternal Grandmother called the FCW\ninquiring about \"getting guardianship of Youth A\". FCW\ninformed Maternal Grandmother that Youth A is in a stable\nplacement. If termination of parental rights occurs, she is\nable to ask for an adoption home study through the\nadoption worker.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of Youth A’s MISACWIS case record,\nMaternal Grandmother had reported she was unable to take\nplacement of Youth A for the majority of the case. In early April\n2025, just prior to biological parents releasing their parental rights,\nMaternal Grandmother notified FCW of her interest in placement\nof Youth A. FCW explained she would pass along her information\nto the assigned adoption agency who would assess her\nhousehold.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n_________6/6/2025_________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 6, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
