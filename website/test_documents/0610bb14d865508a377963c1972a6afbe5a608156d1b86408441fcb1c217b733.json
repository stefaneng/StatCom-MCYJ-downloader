    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period. This CAP related to the agency’s 2023 Renewal inspection\ncompleted on 8/23/2023 where the CAP was approved on 10/1/2023. The agency\nreceived 17 violations, 8 of which are repeat violations this year. The agency’s\ncompliance around these 8 rule violations is as follows: with the exception of\nR400.327(5)(c) and FOM 722-8D where the number of individual cases cited\nincreased from 1 of 3 to 2 of 5; and 2 of 8 to 7 of 8; the other 6 repeat violations\nwith respect to the number of individual cases cited either decreased or stayed the\nsame.\nAs it relates to the agency’s efforts to achieve CAP, the agency provided\ndocumentation showing:\n• It updated its job description related to its administrative clerk’s position so\nas to reflect the education requirement for this position.\n• It revised its quarterly home visit tools used for foster home visits; and its\nlicensing checklist used for licensing reports. Additionality, the agency\nshowed, or I saw via the file reviews, examples of documentation of those\nforms usage, and of spreadsheet tracking.\n• Examples of quarterly tracking and discussions of the reported topics at\nsupervisor/worker supervision meetings, via meeting agendas and\nsupervision notes.\n• Proofs of foster care training, licensing, foster care and adoption meetings\ndiscussions, and team meetings of topic indicated in the CAP; and binders\ncontaining reported information.\n• Examples of emails to foster care staff related to child immunizations.\n• Example of reminder emails sent to supervisors and workers related to\nreport time frames, their Book of Business and outlook Calanders.\n• Examples of licensing, foster care and adoption supervisor supervision\nnotes showing review of discussion of special evaluation’s, inspection\nreports, family team meetings, service plans, monthly visits, sibling visits,\nmedical/dental, medical passport, adoption evaluation due dates and\nsubmission of these evaluations to families.\n• Various proofs of the CAP implementation or completion was also verified\nby way of what was seen or assessed through my case file reviews. This\nrelated to such items as performance evaluations; home visits, updated\nservice plans; child adoption assessment time frames, and adoption\n10",
    "quarterly progress reports, of which the agency had no late or missing\nreports or visits.\nThe agency’s efforts to complete this CAP resulted in some progress in various\nareas. The agency was not totally successful with all, as indicated by the repeat\nviolations indicated in this report. The agency reports it continues its efforts in all\nareas. It is also worth noting, the agency has updated its policies and procedures\nto be more aligned and reflective of the rules.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator (CA) report dated 8/19/2024. The CA’s\nreport indicated areas of repeat noncompliance was impacted by a workforce\ncrisis/ worker turnover. The CA reported due to the worker crisis, supervisors\nspent much time completing tasks the worker should have been completing. The\nCA further reported it is systemic to foster care that foster care workers and\nsupervisors have a higher expectation on them and have higher workloads than\nother positions in child welfare. This fact, and their expected responsibility to\nmaintain child safety weighs on the positions and impacts worker stability/turnover.\nThe agency also reported concern that the department places different standards\non agencies as it relates to compliance, and that such differences is a challenge\nthat impacts compliance.\nThe CA reported the CAP has assisted both workers and supervisors in knowing\nexpectations and that its CAP has been reviewed with staff monthly at meetings.\nThe CA reported that as with new changes, sometimes in an effort to correct and\nimprove in one area, one might lose oversight in others. Notwithstanding that\nchallenge, the CA reported the agency has increased its compliance in many of\nthe requirements related to KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). The CA reported\nthe agency will continue to monitor the agency’s compliance on the CAP through\nsupervision and team meetings.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a copy of it 2024 annual budget and a copy of it 9/30/2023\nindependent financial audit. A review of this information did not show concerns.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the licensee designee, the program manager and\ntwo of the agency's supervisors, I interviewed, one licensing worker, one adoption\nworker, and one foster care worker. The area of strengths reported by these\nworkers related to there being work flexibility, good agency communication,\nsupervisory support, and a connection to management, in that no administrative\nstaff behaves as if they are more important than another person. Areas of growth\nneeded related to having supervisors go out more on visits with new workers,\nmanagerial staff advising staff of their management style upfront, management\nconducting more work with staff upfront on how all things/tasks connect to each\nperson’s position and the agency and its responsibilities, and continued\nrecognition by management of the nature and difficulty of the job, and the stress\nthe responsibilities of the job can have on workers.\n11",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency's site did not reveal any concerns. The agency has\nsufficient space and equipment for its staff, and case files are securely stored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one safety alert pertaining to an unlicensed relative home:\nConcern:\nThe unlicensed relative home did not have an operable smoke detector in the home.\nResolution:\nThe agency provided the unlicensed relative with an operable smoke detector on\n7/2/2024 and it was installed on 7/2/2024. The agency provided a photo showing\nthe installed device.\nConcern:\nOne of the unlicensed relative’s bedrooms could not be viewed due to the relative’s\nson sleeping in the room during the Division of Child Welfare Licensing Analyst’s\nhome visit. Safety concerns could not be assessed.\nResolution:\nThe agency reported the bedroom in question was viewed by the agency worker on\n7/2/2024, and there were no safety concerns. The agency provided photos of the\nroom.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nOctober 4, 2024\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 8, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n12"
