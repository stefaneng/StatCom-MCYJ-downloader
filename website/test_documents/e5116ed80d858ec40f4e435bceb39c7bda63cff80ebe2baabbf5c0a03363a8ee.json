    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4162 Seclusion within secure and nonsecure\nSection facilities; seclusion plan; prohibitions; reduction and\nDescription elimination\n(11) All seclusion will be prohibited effective November 1, 2022.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Between 7/1/25-8/19/25, the facility was using seclusions as a\nform of consequence/punishment rather than a life saving\nmeasure, which is against the terms of their approved seclusion\nvariance.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via video\nconference on 8/25/25. CA reviewed various seclusions with\nConsultant between the dates of 7/1/25-8/19/25. CA reported it\nappeared roughly half of the seclusion reports were written poorly\nbecause they lacked detail regarding de-escalation efforts and key\ndetails which occurred prior to the seclusion. CA reported the\nother half of the seclusions are likely due to staff and supervisors\nfalling back into the “old way” of doing things. CA reported the\nrecent construction to their facility didn’t help because they didn’t\nhave any day room space to allow youth to “cool off” in a neutral\narea. CA reported now that construction is finished, there are\nmore spaces and opportunities for separation of youth from the\ngroup during escalated situations. CA reported supervisors review\nseclusion reports and ultimately team leaders sign off on them,\ntherefore, the discussion about seclusions and when they’re\nallowed needs to be held at all levels. CA reported they have\nalready been speaking to staff about running the behavior\nmanagement program as intended since they only have 10 youth\ncurrently because when they increase capacity the number of\nescalated situations or problems will likely increase as well.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• The facility has had variances approved every two months\nregarding this rule since July 1, 2024. The variance\napproval letter outlines seclusions can only be used under\ncertain circumstances with certain provisions in place. Of\nnote it states:\no Staff must only use seclusion as a temporary\nresponse to prevent life-threatening injury or serious\nbodily harm when other interventions are ineffective.\no Prior to seclusion, staff must use less restrictive\ntechniques to de-escalate the situation such as\n2",
    "talking with youth, bringing in other staff or qualified\nmental health professionals to assist, or engaging\nfamily members or other youth to talk with the youth.\n• Seclusion Reports (15 of 38) were reviewed dated between\n7/1/25-8/19/25 and none of them met the requirements of\nthe facility’s approved variance. There was a lack of\ndocumented efforts to de-escalate the youth prior to issuing\nseclusion, and it was apparent from the narratives,\nseclusion was being used as a consequence/punishment\nrather than a life-saving measure. There were also several\ntimes the youth were separated from the group to calm\ndown, but then still put in seclusion even after the reports\ndocumented the youth were calm.\n• Behavior Management Rooms, Room Restriction and\nRoom Checks Policy states a security violation time out\n(aka seclusion) shall be issued if a resident displays life-\nthreatening behaviors or to prevent serious bodily harm to\nself or others when other interventions are ineffective.\nAnalysis The facility is found in violation as per documentation reviewed\nand the interview conducted the facility is not meeting the\nrequirements of their approved variance regarding seclusions.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nConsultant discussed the fifteen seclusion narratives reviewed\nand provided the CA with a summary of the concerns\ndemonstrating how the seclusions did not meet the requirements\nof their approved variance.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nRenewal Inspection dated 11/6/24; CAP approved 11/22/24\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nSeptember 25, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4"
