He confirmed that\nYouth A had an unplanned discharged the night prior after some\nconcerning behaviors and an AWOL attempt.\nTherapist was interviewed on 02/21/2023 during an announced\nface-to-face visit at the facility. She stated that she had had day-\nto-day interaction with both Youth A and Youth B in the unit as\nwell as in treatment through individual and group therapy.\nTherapist stated that she had heard early on that Youth A and\nYouth B knew each other from a previous placement, and that she\nsaw them in groups displaying inappropriate nonverbal behaviors\ntowards each other early on in their placement. Therapist stated\nthat staff had caught the two youths passing notes between each\nother shortly after. She also recalled that Youth B had to have her\nbedroom moved over the course of her short stay in placement\nbecause of concerns between her and Youth A.\nYouth C, Youth D, Youth E and Youth F were interviewed during\nan announced face-to-face visit to the facility and 02/21/2023. All\nfour youth stated that they had not witnessed Youth A and Youth\nB have any physical interactions but that they had heard that there\nmight have been attempts to sneak away from staff. None were\nable to confirm seeing specific instances of inappropriate\nbehaviors between the two youths or a lack of staff awareness of\nYouth A or Youth B during their time placed at the facility. All four\ninterviewees stated that they had witnessed interactions between\nYouth A and Youth B that amounted to flirtations or inappropriate\ncomments but none that had advanced beyond that. All youth\ndescribed similar interactions and routines with staff and\ndescribed sufficient supervisory acts on behalf of staff.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed during an announced face-to-face\nvisit to the facility on 02/21/2023. She confirmed that she is a\ndirect care staff supervisor as well as the author of the facility’s\nPREA report.

Supervisor 1\n3",
    "recalled a significant safety plan being developed for Youth B in\nearly January, as well as Youth B’s room being moved away from\nYouth A around that same time. She stated that while she was\nconfident that two youth having rooms next to or across the\nhallway from each other would not directly cause concern as far\nas when youth entering another youth’s room when they were not\nsupposed to, she stated that the decision to move Youth B down\nthe hallway created less of a chance of passing notes or\nnonverbal communication through their room windows. Supervisor\n1 did state that youth in the program are not allowed to have\ncoverings over their windows for the first 30 days of placement.\nSupervisor 1 stated that despite the concern with nonverbal\nbehaviors, inappropriate comments to each other as well as\nattempts to pass notes that were caught by staff, she was not\naware of any further behaviors between the two youth as alleged.\nSupervisor 1 also confirmed that a new camera had been installed\nin late January to cover the bedroom hallway and provide greater\nsupervision of youth within the units.\nStaff 1 was interviewed during an announced face-to-face visit to\nthe facility on 02/21/2023. She stated that she remembered the\nconcerns of behavior between Youth A and Youth B in their time\nplaced at the facility together. Staff 1 would follow the two around\nconstantly to attempt to keep supervision. She believed that their\nbehaviors together were noticed almost immediately by her and\nother staff. Staff 1 stated that she heard in a team meeting upon\nYouth B’s placement at the facility that she had a history of\ncreating relationships with other youth placed. Staff 1 stated that\nshe believed there was not a time that Youth A and Youth B were\nable to get out of immediate supervision of her or any other staff\nduring their time placed at the facility together because of the\nintentional efforts by staff.\nYouth A was interviewed over the phone on 02/28/2023. She\nconfirmed that she has since moved from Camp Oakland facility\nand is now placed in a detention center. Youth A recalled her time\nplaced at the facility with Youth B. Youth A stated that she noticed\nthat more cameras within the unit were put up the day that she\nmoved in, in November. Youth A stated that she recalled Youth B\nattempting to form a relationship with her immediately after Youth\nB moved in because they knew each other from a previous\nplacement. These attempts included attempting to pull Youth A\ninto rooms with her as well as sneaking into the back hallway\nbeyond camera supervision. Youth A stated that none of these\nattempts ever actually advanced any further, and that there were\nseveral occasions when staff noticed the two interacting. Youth A\n4",
    "stated that she had received instructions shortly after Youth B\nmove moved in that the two youth had to be at least six feet apart\nat all times and we’re not allowed to sit near each other while\neating or during any group activities. Youth A confirmed the similar\nconversations that Supervisor 1 had described in regard to safe\nbehaviors. Youth A reiterated that she had never had any sexual\ninteraction with Youth B, nor had any behaviors past verbal\ncommunication that were inappropriate during their time placed\ntogether.\nYouth B was interviewed over the phone on 02/28/2023. She\nconfirmed that she had been previously placed at the facility with\nYouth A and that she also knew Youth A from a prior placement in\n2022. Youth B denied ever having any sort of physical or sexual\ncontact with Youth A. She also described her experiences with\nstaff supervision while placed at the facility. She stated that staff\nwere always on their feet and standing in the hallway or in the\ncommon areas in order to supervise youth. Youth B did recall that\nthere were a couple of blind spots on the cameras in the units, but\nthat staff were very aware and worked to disallow youth from\ngoing to those areas. Youth B stated that, while she disagreed\nwith the reasoning, she remembered having her room moved\ndown the hallway away from Youth A. Youth B believed that the\nrules were getting more strict on interactions between youth as\nshe was placed because she heard other youth state as such.\nYouth B stated that she also did not agree with the reasoning\nbehind the enhanced supervision and requirements on her safety\nplan that was started while placed at the facility, but she also\nagreed to the terms of it, and did not have any trouble following it.\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 were interviewed over the phone separately on\n02/28/2023. Both staff stated that they had concerns between\nYouth A and Youth B while placed at the facility, but they believed\nthat their supervision was sufficient and prevented the two youths\nfrom ever doing anything inappropriate between each other during\ntheir time placed there. Both staff denied ever witnessing Youth A\nand Youth B being physical with each other or being able to sneak\naway from staff supervision.\nStaff 4 was interviewed over the phone on 03/01/2023. She stated\nthat she had previously worked at the facility during the time of\nYouth A and Youth B’s placement. She denied ever witnessing\nthese two youths doing anything inappropriate with each other and\nstated that she was well aware of the concerns that others had\nand the enhanced measures that were taken to ensure safety\n5",
    "between the two youths. She believed that those measures were\nsuccessful.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• PREA Screening Tool dated 11/30/2022 for Youth A\noutlining expectations for behavior management and\nstandards of conduct for youth.\n• PREA Screening Tool dated 12/22/2022 for Youth B\noutlining expectations for behavior management and\nstandards of conduct for youth.\n• Treatment Team Meeting Agenda dated 12/28/2022 that\ncovered concerns between various youth and physical\ndistancing and staff supervising and correcting any\ninappropriate language between youth. Supervisor 1 noted\nthat this conversation was in part caused by interactions\nwitnessed between Youth A and Youth B upon Youth B’s\nplacement.\n• Treatment Team Meeting Agenda dated 01/04/2023 that\ncovers Youth B having her bedroom moved away from\nYouth A because of PREA concerns.\n• Safety Plan for Youth B dated 01/11/2023, signed by Youth\nB. The cause is stated that she was displaying\ninappropriate behavior and boundaries towards peers\ncausing PREA concerns. The proactive interventions listed\nconsisted of minimum spacing between the youth and other\nyouth as well as requirements to log inappropriate\nbehaviors.\n• Facility Line of Sight policy last revised January 2018. It\nrequires youth to be under direct supervision of staff while\nin the units with direct supervision defined as being in the\nbest reasonable physical position to ensure visual contact\nwith the youth.\n• Internal PREA investigation authored by Supervisor 1 dated\n01/26/2023. This report contained similar allegations to\nwhat was received by DCWL to begin this investigation.\nYouth A was interviewed by Supervisor 1 on 01/21/2023.\nYouth A alleged that Youth B had propositioned Youth A to\nperform sexual acts and has attempted to kiss her during\nlate December, but that Youth A did not want to participate\nin those acts. Youth A stated that Youth B had still asked\nabout doing sexual things in the month of January but that\nstaff supervision did not allow these behaviors to occur.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face and phone interviews of youth and staff and\ndocumentation reviewed there was not evidence found of any lack\nof supervision of youth at the facility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
