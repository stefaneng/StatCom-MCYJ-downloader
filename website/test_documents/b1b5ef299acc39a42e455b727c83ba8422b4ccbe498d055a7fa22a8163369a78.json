The agency must inform the\nparent or parents and foster parent that the\ninformation in the parent-agency treatment plan\nand any other information about the child and the\nchild's family is confidential.\nThree of six foster care case records reviewed did not indicate that the plan was\ndeveloped with the parent/parents or foster parents to enable the\nparent/parents/foster parents to understand the plan.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n2",
    "• Technical Assistance was not requested or required.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Consultation was not requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance:\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the individual CAP is as follows:\nThe agency Renewal inspection was completed on 02/16/24 and the CAP was\ncompleted on 02/26/2024. The agency was found in noncompliance with DHHS\npolicies 722.08D which is no longer regulated by DCWL. There are no repeat\nviolations, but the agency is struggling with getting the Parent Agency Treatment\nPlans signed timely to indicate the responsible party was involved. Overall, the\nagency is making efforts to improve this noncompliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed with the Chief\nAdministrator (CA) onsite 05/14/2025. The CA reported barriers and systemic\nfactors that impacted rules, ISEP, policy and contract compliance which included\nhigh staff turnover. The CA reported the previous CAP was not successful due to\nhigh staff turnover and all processes were not always being followed. The\nCorrective Action Plan (CAP) has brought attention to areas that need oversight\nand improvement. It has provided supervisory guidelines to improve compliance\nand tracking with departmental reports to assist with task completion due dates\nand reminders. The CAP was provided to the staff with a check and balance\nsystem to ensure all metrics are met per policy and ISEP. The CAP provided staff\nwith refresher training to improve quality of work. Also, the CAP enforced\nsupervisory accountability to ensure staff are adhering to policy and ISEP\nstandards.\nFinancial Overview:\nThe agency annual audit by an independent certified public accountant dated\n9/30/24 and their annual budget were reviewed. No concerns were noted.\n3",
    "Staff Interviews:\nThree staff were interviewed, and they reported they enjoyed working at the\nagency. The staff reported they are supported by their supervisors and coworkers.\nStaff reported they would love to receive more recognition for the job duties from\nhigher administration.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through:\nThe building has adequate space to provide the required services, and the record\nmaintenance were stored securely.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS:\nThere were no safety alerts.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n6/16/25\n__________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6/16/2025\n__________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4"
