    "another state, they agreed to do the adoption. Ennis Adoption\nSpecialist requested the Texas agency submit their requirements\nfor the private adoption and a contact person name and/or other\ncredentials. CA reported once Adoption Specialist received this\ninformation, she shared it with CA.\nCA reported when he reviewed the adoption information\nrequirements and noted how much confidential information was\nneeded from Ennis, he had an administrative team meeting with\nthe administrators from Ennis.

    "Adoption Specialist was no longer working with Potential Adoptive\nParents case. It is also noted that the child for adoption was not\nassigned to Ennis due to all needed documents and assessments\nthat needed to be signed and completed prior to the agency\nassignment. CA reported the paperwork from Ennis to Texas went\nback and forth during the next several months and on 3-10-2025,\nEnnis was advised there was a subcontractor consent that needed\nto be signed by the Executive Director of Ennis. He reported this\ndocument was signed and sent back to the representative of\nTexas handling the adoption on 4/3/2025.\nQuality Improvement and Contracts Specialist of Texas was\ninterviewed via telephone on 3/12/2025. She reported this\nadoption is a process, and their agency works multiple contracts\nat a time as well as actively reviewing existing contracts. She\nreported regarding the timeline for completing this adoption\nprocess is not a matter of Ennis or OCOK, not actively working on\nthis adoption process. She reported that both Ennis and OCOK\ntook the appropriate time to make sure what was needed and\ncame together to review the required documents and have been\nturning in the paperwork requested timely to OCOK and her\ndepartment to Texas. The Quality Improvement and Contracts\nSpecialist reported she has been going through those items as her\nactive schedule allows and as the adoption process is near the\nend. She reported she was working to make sure Potential\nAdoptive Parent 1 and Potential Adoptive Parent 2’s notifications\nwere active so they could be added to the network and hopefully\nnotifying them would help in understanding the process better.\nShe reported this timeline is not abnormal by any means and the\ncontracting process can take from 30-60 days.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Ennis – Williamston generic caregiver notification adoption\npolicy was reviewed. It states that when a child is placed in a\nfoster/adoptive home with the provider’s name, the social service\ncaseworker or agency case manager will acquire the signatures\nfrom each foster parent to acknowledge receipt of the K-908-2279\nand Attachment A; and will also acquire these signatures when\nthere is an update to Attachment A.\n• Ennis uses the Adoption Contract policy Adoption Code,\n1974 PA 296, (MCL 710.let seq) also known as the Michigan\nAdoption Code. The policy states that Children are available for\nadoption following the termination of parental rights or following\nthe voluntary release of parental rights with commitment to\nMDHHS. All foster youth available for adoption, with adoption as\ntheir permanency goal, must be referred for adoption services.\n4",

Ennis has an\nadoption policy in place for adoption of youth who have a\npermanency goal of adoption and followed their policy.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n5/13/2025\n___________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n5/20/2025\n______________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n6"
