    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10165 Resident Nutrition\nSection (1) A facility shall provide a minimum of 3 nutritious meals daily,\nDescription unless medically contraindicated and documented.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth is always starving and has lost 15 pounds since being at\nthe facility because he's not getting enough food. There are\nconcerns he is given the same amount of food as youth half his\nsize. Youth’s mother tried to purchase additional food for him but\nwas told no. When the facility staff noticed youth started losing\nweight, he was given two protein shakes per day in addition to his\nregular meals.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 6/28/23.\nComplainant was a MDHHS Worker on an investigation on the\nfacility unrelated to these allegations. Complainant was told the\nallegations by Youth A’s mother during a phone call. Complainant\nnoted Youth A did not mention either of these concerns during his\ninterview with her for the unrelated investigation.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/28/23.\nYouth A reported he has been at the facility since 4/6/23. He\nreported he weighed 185lbs when he entered the facility and is\nnow done to 171lbs. Youth A reported he is not eating as much\nprotein as he was prior to entering the facility. Youth A stated\nwhen he was at home, he was lifting weights every day and was\neating 10,000-20,000 calories per day, so he was basically eating\nall day. Youth A reported while at the facility, he is fed three meals\nper day, which includes a meat, a type of vegetable, a side, and a\nmilk carton. Youth A reported its smaller portions than he’s used\nto for everything, so he never feels full. He reported the youth do\nnot receive second helpings of food. Youth A stated he received\none snack per day in between shift change (i.e., rice Krispie treat,\nbag of chips, bag of cookies, package of peanut butter crackers).\nYouth A stated now that he’s lost so much weight, he also\nreceives two Ensure shakes per day (one at breakfast and one at\ndinner), but they do not help keep him full either. Youth A reported\nhe feels like he’s starving every day. Youth A reported he’s written\ngrievances a few times asking for extra food, but the facility has\ndenied his requests.\nNurse was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/28/23.\nNurse reported on 6/9/23, Youth A was seen for a routine\nappointment and his weight was down 15lbs. Nurse confirmed\n2",
    "Youth A weighed 185lbs. on 4/10/23 and weighed 171lbs. on\n6/9/23. Due to his weight loss, Nurse talked to the doctor and the\ndoctor prescribed two Ensure shakes per day, so Youth A was\nconsuming additional calories. Nurse reported they are required to\nfollow guidelines from the government regarding calories and use\nthe government established food pyramid to do so.\nProbation Officer was interviewed via phone on 7/12/23.\nProbation Officer reported she has no concerns with the care\nYouth A is receiving. Probation Officer reported the meals the\nyouth receive are monitored by a nutritionist and the facility must\nfollow certain guidelines, which they are following. Probation\nOfficer reported Youth A receives three meals per day, two\nEnsure shakes per day and up to three snacks per day.\nYouth A’s Mother was interviewed via phone on 7/12/23.\nMother reported she is very concerned her son has lost 15lbs. in\nless than three months. Mother reported they do not take the\nyouth outside often, so they just do indoor activities one hour per\nday. Mother reported Youth A couldn’t go outside for weeks due to\nrestrictions from the bullet wound on his leg. Mother stated once\nhe was off restrictions, the facility reported they do more indoor\nactivities than outdoor because of low staffing. Mother reported\nYouth A is used to being outside and working out all the time\nbecause he participates in weightlifting, wrestling and football, so\nbeing in the facility has been difficult for him. Mother reported\nYouth A was eating 10,000-20,000 calories of food per day prior to\nentering the facility (i.e., 12 pieces of French toast for breakfast,\ntwo massive steaks for dinner, a whole pot of spaghetti). Since his\ncalorie intake has significantly reduced at the facility, he feels like\nhe’s starving all the time. Mother reported she has offered to buy\nprotein powder so he can make his own protein shakes, but she\nwas told no. Mother reported he began receiving two Ensure\nshakes per day, but those shakes are not helping him much\nbecause he still feels he is starving every day. Mother reported\nshe has also offered to buys snacks for all of the youth at the\nfacility, so it’s not unfair her son is the only one getting extra food,\nbut she was told no.\nAttempts were made to interview Dietician on 7/21/23 and\n7/24/23. A voicemail was left each time, but no return call was\nreceived. Dietician is not employed by the facility. Dietician is\nemployed by a third party called Canteen Services.\n3",
