The initial complaint was\nunfounded but an additional finding was made. Reviewing Youth A’s Residential\nService plan it was found the plan was lacking basic information that is required.\nThe facility’s CAP was approved on 7/7/22 and involved the development of a\nspecialist to review all key requirments with the treatment plans to ensure accuracy.\nChief Administrator was to develop a review form and template to assist in the\ndevelopment of the treatment plans. The faciltiy will also schedule reviews of the\ntreatment plans for initial and updated treatment plans. Although this investigation\ninvolved treatment plans the issues were not the same as found in the Renewal\nInspection dated 12/17/21. The facility’s corrective action plan compliance is\nmonitored quarterly and no further issues have been identified.\nThe other CAP submitted was in regards to the facility’s Renewal Inspection for\n2021. There were six violations for this review and the facility submitted a CAP\nwhich was approved on 1/19/22.\nFinancial Overview\nThe yearly financial audit was completed on 4/13/2023 and there are no financial\nconcerns identified based on the facility’s budget and financial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator documents the efforts and progress they made in following their\nCAP from the Renewal inspection and special investigation that occurred during the\nperiod under review.

All rooms were of appropriate\ntemperature.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules.
