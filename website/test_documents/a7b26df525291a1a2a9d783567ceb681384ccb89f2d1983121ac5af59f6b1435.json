Administrator 1 reported, after they received the\ngrievances filed by Youth A and Youth B, they asked Staff 1\nconcerning the comments he made concerning the youth’s hair.\nStaff 1 had reported to them he did state their “hair looked nice in\na bun.” Administrator 1 reported in the context Staff 1 disclosed\n3",
    "this information it did not seem out of the normal. Administrator 1\nreported he wouldn’t tell his staff to stop complimenting the youth.\nStaff are to help build their youth’s self-esteem. Administrator 1\nreported Youth A and Youth B reported the situation differently\nthan Staff 1 had. (see grievance document). Administrator 1\nreported the allegations of sexual touching then came and they\nceased their internal interviews and no one else talked to Staff 1\nconcerning the incident.\nAdministrator 2:\nAdministrator 2 reported when Youth A goes into her room for\nseclusion, she has a tendency to strip down to her bra and\nunderwear. Youth A knows this is not permitted but continues to\ndo this. Administrator 2 reported there is a magnet that covers the\nbedroom door window, staff knock on the door to ensure the youth\nare clothed and then pull down the magnet to check on the youth.\nYouth A will sometimes not answer, but they still have to check.\nWhen they do check, they will find her in her bra and underwear.\nAdministrator 1 confirmed this. Both reported Staff 1 does not\nnormally supervise Youth A but does help when youth are in\nseclusion.\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported she was placed in seclusion on 2/12/24 for\n“swinging” on another youth. Youth A reported when she is in\nseclusion staff knock on the door and then lift up the magnet\ncovering her bedroom door window to make sure she is okay.\nYouth A reports when they come to the window and knock, she\ncovers herself with a blanket or puts on a t-shirt. Youth A reported\nsometimes she walks around in her bra and underwear in her\nbedroom. She reported she does this because she wants to.\nYouth A reported she was in her room on 2/12/24 and Staff 1\nknocked on her door and asked to take down the magnet. She\nreported she was covered up with a blanket and then he took the\nmagnet down. She reported Staff 1 then said, “Let me see\nsomething.” Youth A reported Staff 1’s comment was “sexual” in\nnature but was unable to state why she thought it was. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 laughed after he made this comment and walked\naway. In a separate situation, Youth A reported she was in a room\nquietly doing something (unable to remember what or which room)\nwhen Staff 1 told her, “Your butt is big.” Youth A then reported she\nremembered she was playing cards in the dayroom with Staff 1\nwhen he said to her, “butt was big.” Youth A reported no one else\nheard this. Youth A was questioned if there were any other\ninteraction she wanted to share and then she reported during her\nseclusion on 2/12/24, she asked Staff 1 for headphones and when\n4",
    "Staff 1 gave them to her, he touched her butt. Youth A reported\ninitially that he “smacked” her butt, then reported that he touched it\nquick and lightly, not smacked.

Youth A reported he then spoke on the\nintercom and said, “it was wet.” When asked to explain this, Youth\nA reported when Staff 1 touched her butt, he also “fingered her\nvagina very quickly with one finger, back and forth twice.” Youth A\nreported he touched her underneath her underwear. She reported\nshe didn’t say anything to him. Youth A reported she was okay\nwith him touching her. Youth A reported this was the last time he\ntouched her.

He reported he has never seen Staff 1 interact with Youth\nA inappropriately.

Supervisor 1 reported Youth A will take her clothes off\nanytime she is upset and in her room. Supervisor 1 reported\nYouth A will try to receive extra food from staff and has stated she\nis trying to get staff fired. Supervisor 1 reported a time Youth A\nwas in her room during medication passing and exposed herself to\nstaff, wearing only her bra and underwear. Supervisor 1 reported\nshe does this often. Supervisor 1 was asked about the\nexpectations for seclusion, specifically taking headphones from a\nyouth. Supervisor 1 reported it is normal to take headphones from\na youth when they are in seclusion, but she should not have\nreceived them back. Supervisor 1 reported when a youth is in\nseclusion, the door should not be opened unless there is another\nstaff present.\nStaff 1\nStaff 1 was asked to discuss interactions he has had with Youth A.\nStaff 1 reported he remembers a time he was supervising the\nfemale unit in the dayroom and the male unit was also present.\nYouth A attempted to whisper to the males on the unit and he\nredirected her conversation so she would no longer engage with\n5",
    "the males. Staff 1 reported she and Youth B wanted to sit next to\nthe boys and he would not let them. Youth A asked him, “Do you\nthink I talk to boys a lot? Is that why you are keeping me away?”\nStaff 1 reported he told her they were not supposed to be\ninteracting with the male unit. Staff 1 reported Youth A wanted to\nfile a grievance on him for this interaction, so he gave her a\ngrievance form to fill out. Staff 1 reported he also staffed her in\nseclusion once. Staff 1 reported he completed checks on her and\nshe called him often on the intercom system. Staff 1 reported he\nsits in the staff office while monitoring seclusion and there is an\nintercom system the youth can use to ask questions, and this can\nbe heard in the staff office.

Staff 1\nreported Youth A was initially upset she was in the room but\nwasn’t threatening or yelling.

Staff 1 reported he never touched her butt, made\na comment about her butt, or her body, or touched her vagina.\nStaff 2\nStaff 2 received the paper grievance form from Youth A and was\nthe staff Youth A told the allegations to. Staff 2 reported Youth A\ntold her Staff 1 said her hair, “looked better in a bun.” Staff 2\nreported she did not find anything wrong with this comment\nbecause it is okay to compliment youth. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nalso stated, the unit and Staff 1 were in the dayroom together.\nAfter she sat down at a table, Youth A reported Staff 1 said, “Why\ndid you sit down so quick. I was trying to see that thing.” Staff 2\nreported she asked, “what thing” and Youth A reported “you know\nwhat thing,” implying her butt. Youth A reported to her no one else\nheard. Staff 2 reported Youth A stated Staff 1 would not let her go\nto the male table while in the dayroom because Staff 1 “liked her\nand wanted her all to himself.” Staff 2 reported Youth A stated\nStaff 1 never actually said this, but Youth A thought this was the\nreason why. Staff 2 reported Youth A never mentioned Staff 1\ntouched her. Staff 2 reported as staff they do not have to let the\nmale and female youth interact in the dayroom. Staff 2 reported\nshe has worked with Staff 1 before and has never seen him\ninteract with any youth inappropriately. Staff 2 reported she has\nnever seen Staff 1 give Youth A more attention than any other\n6",
    "youth. Staff 2 does not recall ever seeing Staff 1 sit with Youth A\nin the dayroom. Staff 2 described Staff 1 as a firm staff holding the\nyouth accountable. Staff 2 reported Youth A has openly discussed\nmale youth in the unit and has reported multiple “crushes” on the\nboys. She openly talks about being intimate with boys. Staff 2\nreported Youth A wears her bra and underwear while in her room\nand when questioned about this behavior displays an “I don’t care\nattitude.”\nStaff 3\nStaff 3 reported she has been Staff 1’s work partner for about a\nyear. Staff 3 reported she has never seen Staff 1 “overly friendly”\nwith Youth A. Staff 3 reported Youth A will openly flirt with male\nstaff and the boys in the other unit.

This seems to be Youth A’s “common\npractice.”\nYouth B\nYouth B wrote a grievance the same day as Youth A.
