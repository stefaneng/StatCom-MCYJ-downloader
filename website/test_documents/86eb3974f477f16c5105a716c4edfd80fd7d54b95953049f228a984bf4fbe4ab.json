They\nfinally started giving it to her at night. The staff gives her Adderall\ncapsule, but they open it and dissolve it into a glass of water\nwhich is not as effective.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via phone on 5/16/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Complainant reported Youth\nA was without medication for a week once entering the facility.\nYouth A’s mother requested medication be given but was told “the\nfacility does not provide sleeping medication”.
