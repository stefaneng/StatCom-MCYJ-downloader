She stated that Youth A\nwas cooperative during the intake process but about an hour later\nYouth A began to escalate significantly. Staff 5 recalled asking\nStaff 1 to check on Youth A in her room because of the yelling and\ncrying that could be heard. Staff 5 recalled hearing Youth A yell\noutside of her open door that she needed to leave and go to the\nhospital. Staff 5 also recalled hearing Youth A refer to her\nbedsheets as something she would use to harm herself. Staff 5\nthen saw Staff 1 enter Youth A’s room and then come back out\nwith Youth A’s bedsheets in hand and noted that Staff 1 was only\nin there for less than 30 seconds.

Staff 5 stated that Youth A was offered a\nphone call which she completed with her mother. After the phone\ncall Youth A refused to go back to her room and sat in the\nhallway. Staff 5 recalled discussing this with Staff 1 and the Chief\nAdministrator and while Youth A was escalated and verbally\naggressive, they all agreed to continue to attempt to de-escalate\nher verbally. Staff 5 noted that after some time Youth A de-\nescalated and went back to her room for the end of the night.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Video footage of 09/20/2023 capturing the interactions\nbetween Youth A, Staff 1 and Staff 5 was reviewed. In the\nfootage the empty west wing unit hallway can be\nseen. Staff 1 walked down the hallway to the last room on\nthe left. She opened the door and interacted with Youth A,\nwho cannot be seen while inside her room. After\napproximately three minutes of interaction, Staff 1 entered\nYouth A’s room. She then exited the room approximately\n15 seconds later holding bedding. While this occurred Staff\n5 walked down the unit hallway to meet Staff 1. Staff 1\ninteracted with Youth A for another minute before closing\nthe door to Youth A’s room, and she and Staff 5 then\nwalked down the hallway away from the room.\n• Internal documentation describing the intake process and\nthe beginning of Youth A’s placement was reviewed. It\nnoted that Youth A arrived at the facility at approximately\n4:15 pm on 09/20/2023. She completed her intake and no\n3",
    "concerns about her behavior or affect were noted. It noted\nthat after a phone call with her mother at approximately\n6:45 am she stated that she needed to leave and go to the\nhospital because she didn't want to be at the\nfacility. Because of comments made about self-harm,\nYouth A’s bedding was removed from her room. At the\ntime of the writing of this documentation it was noted that\nYouth A was refusing to go into her room and was telling\nstaff she was going to physically harm them. Later in the\nnight it was documented that staff interacted with Youth A\nafter sleeping hours began. Youth A asked staff if there\nwas someone that she could speak with, and she further\nstated that she was feeling upset and that she was afraid\nshe might harm herself while placed at the facility. It was\ndocumented further that Youth A stated that she needed to\n“get out” of the facility and that she wanted to go to the\nhospital to spend her “two weeks there.” It was\ndocumented that Youth A then fell asleep.\nAnalysis Through interviews of youth and staff, documentation and video\nfootage reviewed there is not sufficient evidence that any rules\nwere violated in the interaction and removal of bedding of Youth A\non 09/20/2023.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the\nseverity of the youth’s behavior, chronological and\ndevelopmental age, size, gender, physical condition,\nmedical condition, psychiatric condition, and personal\nhistory, including any history of trauma, and must be done\nin a manner consistent with the youth’s treatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was bruised during a restraint by Staff 2 and Staff 3.\nInvestigation The complainant was interviewed on 09/25/2023 and no\nadditional information was provided.\nYouth A was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n10/03/2023. Youth A was asked to describe what occurred the\nnext morning after the 09/20/2023 incident. She stated that she\nwas asked to take her shower and refused to do so. Youth A\ndescribed interacting with Staff 1 at this point in time and that Staff\n1 was rude to her, but did not have any more details to provide on\nwhat was said to her. Youth A told staff that she would shower so\n4",
    "that they would let her out of her room for the morning. Youth A\nrecalled telling staff she would not shower, as was her original\nintent. Youth A then refused to do anything other than stay in the\nhallway of the unit. Youth A recalled hitting things on the walls\nand yelling at staff. Youth A recalled that she was eventually\nrestrained and moved from this unit to the other unit across the\nbuilding. She believed this was performed by Staff 2 and Staff 3\nbut was not sure. Youth A stated that she was held from behind\nby one of these male staff and that she had trouble breathing, but\nshe could not recall which staff member that was. She also\nrecalled being able to get one arm free because she was\nattempting to grab on to things as she was moved across the\nbuilding. Youth A stated she sat on the floor next to another\nbedroom in the opposite unit of the building and continued to yell\nat staff. Youth A recalled feeling panicked and throwing up on the\nfloor at this point. Youth A recalled two staff, who she could not\nname, picking her up and moving her into the adjacent\nbedroom. Youth A believed that the door was closed on her leg at\nthat point and that was how she got a bruise on her leg. Youth A\nstated that staff were not saying anything to her while she was\nrestrained or sitting next to her new bedroom.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 10/05/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 1\nrecalled that she worked the morning of 09/21/2023 and that she\nwas the staff member responsible for letting the youth out of their\nrooms first thing in the morning to use the shower. Staff 1 recalled\nopening the door to Youth A’s room, and that Youth A was already\nawake and that Youth A remarked “Get the fuck away from me,”\nand then proceeded to cuss and use racial slurs at Staff 1. Youth\nA was also threatening to punch Staff 1 and the other staff\nworking that morning, Staff 4. Youth A then left her room, but\nrefused to shower, pacing up and down the unit hallway and\nsitting on the floor, similar to the night before. Staff 1 and Staff 4\nstated that they stood outside the door to the hallway of the unit\nand supervised Youth A and attempted to de-escalate her. Staff 1\nrecalled that Youth A broke a hand sanitizer dispenser located on\nthe wall and that is what caused her to come back into the unit.\nStaff 1 stated that there was concern over Youth A's past behavior\nas well as her dialogue in that moment that Youth A might attempt\nto use that to harm herself. Staff 1 stated that she and Staff 3\ncame into the unit hallway. Staff 1 recalled that Staff 3 attempted\nto start a standing hold restraint, but Youth A immediately fought\nthis. Staff 1 recalled Staff 3 telling her to not try to get involved\nbecause of the verbal statements Youth A had made to Staff\n1. Staff 1 stated that she believed Staff 4 then went into help with\n5",
    "restraining Youth A. Staff 1 stated that she walked away from the\nsituation. The next time she saw Youth A she was sitting on the\nfloor in a separate unit next to the room that staff use for youth\nthat are on suicide watch. Overall, Staff 1 stated that she never\nsaw anyone hit or punch or push Youth A. Staff 1 stated that she\nnever touched Youth A other than incidental contact very briefly\nwhen Youth A was initially kicking at her and Staff 3. Staff 1 also\ndid not recall seeing any marks or bruises on Youth A's person.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 10/05/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 2\nstated that he did not work the evening of Youth A’s placement at\nthe facility, but did work the next morning. Staff 2 stated that he\nwas not involved with Youth A until he saw Staff 3 attempting to\nmove Youth A from one unit to the other. Staff 2 believed Staff 3\nwas using a “cradle carry” assist with Youth A. Staff 2 clarified that\nhe did not see exactly what was occurring. Staff 2 stated that he\nbecame involved when Youth A was sitting outside of her new\nroom and that Staff 2 tried to talk her into going in, so that she\ncould be more calm and move on from the situation. Staff 2\nrecalled that Staff 3 instructed him to put Youth A in a “hook\ntransport” at that point. Staff 2 stated that this involved him lifting\nYouth A up by her left arm and Staff 3 picking her up from her\nright arm and they lifted her from a seated position on the floor.\nStaff 2 stated that this allowed them to move Youth A right around\nthe corner into her room, but that Youth A was fighting back and\nkicking at them as this occurred. Staff 2 recalled that Youth A was\nable to get her hands on the doorway which prevented them from\nleaving the room. Staff 2 stated that he was not sure how Youth\nA’s hands left the doorway, but eventually they did, and they were\nable to set her down and leave the room. Staff 2 stated that, when\nthis occurred Youth A continued to yell obscenities at any staff\nthat were present. He stated that he never hit Youth A, pushed\nher, and that his interaction with her physically only lasted less\nthan a minute. He also stated that she did not fall when she was\nsat down by him.\nStaff 3 was interviewed on 10/05/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 3\nstated that he did not work on the evening of 09/20/2023 and did\nnot interact with Youth A, but did on the morning of 09/21/2023.\nStaff 3 stated that he was elsewhere in the building when he\nreceived a call from Staff 1 asking him to come assist with Youth\nA. Staff 3 went to the west wing where Youth A was located, and\nhe stated that Youth A was screaming and yelling in the hallway of\nthe wing. Staff 3 stated that he then went around the corner to the\n6",
    "control room to call the Chief Administrator but as he did so, he\nheard Staff 1 remark that Youth A was breaking the hand sanitizer\ndispenser off of the wall. Staff 3 stated that because Youth A did\nthis and because she had been so escalated and threatening staff\nand threatening self harm against herself, that this was a situation\nthey deemed a “crisis to self” and that there was concern that she\nmight try to break the hand sanitizer dispenser further and use it to\nharm herself. Staff 3 stated that the decision was made to move\nher to one of the camera rooms in the east wing. Staff 3 recalled\napproaching Youth A and telling her that this was what they were\ngoing to do and asking her to come with them, and she\nimmediately refused. Staff 3 stated that he attempted to use a\nstanding restraint with Youth A only for her to fight back and hit\nhim and wiggle away from him. He recalled her stating “You’re\nhurting me” at points when he did not even have his hands on her.\nStaff 3 stated that he then attempted to use a “cradle carry” to the\nother wing. Staff 3 stated that this was successful as Youth A\nfought back less until he lost control over one of her arms and she\ngrabbed a support pull that stands in the middle of the common\narea between the two units. Staff 3 recalled that Staff 4 was able\nto peel Youth A's fingers off the pole, and that this occurred again\nabout 10 feet further. Once Youth A let go of the second pole,\nStaff 3ert recalled that he was able to move her into the east wing\ninto the doorway of her new room. Staff 3ert called that Youth A\nthen put her feet on the doorway of the room and refused to go\ninside, so at that point, he decided to set her down and allow her\nto sit on the floor outside of the room. Staff 3 recalled that he and\nthe other staff present, to which he could not exactly recall who, all\ntried to de-escalate Youth A verbally. Staff 3 stated that this lasted\nfor a few more minutes. Staff 3 recalled that Youth A was still\nescalated, threatening to hurt herself and staff and cussing and\nusing racial slurs against certain staff members. He stated that he\ncalled the Chief Administrator and that the Chief Administrator and\nhe agreed that they could try to safely move her to her room if that\nwas the only way that she would make it in there. Staff 3 stated\nthat they tried to de-escalate more after that as a good faith effort\ntowards Youth A. Staff 3 recalled that Youth A would continuously\nsay that she would get up and go to her room to then immediately\nbacktrack and state that she would not, and then continue to be as\nescalated as moments prior. Staff 3 recalled telling Staff 2 that it\nwas time to attempt to pick Youth A up from the ground. Staff 3\nstated that he clearly communicated with Youth A what they were\ngoing to do. He and Staff 2 then performed a hook transport with\nStaff 3 on her right side and Staff 2 on her left. Staff 3 recalled that\nYouth A initially stood up, but then resorted back to fighting,\nwiggling, and flailing, making it difficult for them to safely hold her.\n7",
    "Staff 3 stated that they quickly got her into the door as Staff 2\nentered first and then Staff 3. He then recalled that as they\nreleased Youth A, she was on her feet and as soon as their hands\nleft her, she charged at them attempting to hit and get past them\nto the hallway. Staff 3 stated that he recalled Youth A holding her\nhands on the door frame, but then letting go as they closed the\ndoor without issue. He also recalled that Youth A was so\nescalated that she was visibly gagging, and he called her\ncommenting that she was going to throw up, but she never did.\nStaff 3 stated that he remembered seeing Youth A standing on her\nbed, ripping up the toilet paper in her room at that point. He did\nnot recall anyone taking the toilet paper away from her at that\npoint. Staff 3 also did not see any marks or bruises on Youth A at\nthat point, but he did recall her yelling about being bruised.\nStaff 4 was interviewed on 10/05/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. Staff 4\nstated that she first interacted with Youth A on 09/21/2023 when\nStaff 1 was attempting to assist Youth A with taking a shower first\nthing in the morning. Staff 4 recalled hearing Youth A yell, racial\nslurs at Staff 1 and telling her to shut the fuck up. At that point in\ntime, Staff 4 recalled that Staff 1 just closed Youth A's door to then\nattempt to help another youth shower. At that point Staff 4 recalls\nhearing Youth A, said that she actually would comply and take her\nshower, and then Staff 1 opened her door to let her out. Youth A\nthen came out of her room and escalated further and stated that\nshe would not be showering. Staff 4 recalled attempting to talk to\nYouth A to try to de-escalate her. Staff 4 stated that Youth A was\njust sitting on the floor of the hallway of the unit at that point.\nYouth A then followed Staff 4 and Staff 1 towards the end of the\nhallway and stated that she was going to run out of the unit and\ncontinue to escalate further. Staff 4 recalled that Youth A tried to\nsqueeze her and Staff 1 but she was stopped when Staff 1\nattempted to shut the door to the hallway. Staff 4 stated that she\nsaw Youth A turn around and strike the hand sanitizer dispenser\nthat was on the wall and try to pull it off to break it. Staff 4 recalled\nthen switching with Staff 3 so that she could work with the boys\nunit and Staff 3 would continue with Youth A. Staff 4 stated that\nshe had moved some distance away, but she did see Staff 3 open\nthe hallway door again to interact with Youth A. Staff 4 believed at\nthat point that Youth A was escalated to the point of being\nhysterical and there was great difficulty in helping her calm down,\nor reasoning with her. Staff 4 recalled seeing Staff 3 using a\ncradle assist to move Youth A from the west wing to the east wing\nand crossing through a common area. When Staff 4 saw Youth A\nget her hands free and grab onto a support pole to stop the\n8",
    "momentum of Staff 3, Staff 4 recalled helping peel Youth A's\nhands off the pole. Staff 4 recalled seeing Staff 3 escort Youth A\nthrough the door to the east unit and gently setting her down so\nshe was then sitting outside of the doorway of the first bedroom in\nthat unit. Staff 4 recalled attempting to talk to Youth A more to de-\nescalate her at this point. Staff 4 also recalled Youth A going\nback-and-forth stating that she would go into the room but then\nrefusing, several times going back-and-forth from being calm to\nbeing further escalated. Staff 4 recalled Staff 3 telling Staff 2 to\nassist him with a “two person assist” where Staff 3 and Staff 2\npicked Youth A up from her armpits from the sitting position on the\nfloor. Staff 4 recalled seeing Youth A kicking off the door as Staff 3\nand Staff 2 were able to get her inside to then set her down on her\nfeet. Staff 4 recalled hearing Youth A screaming about her leg but\nbeing confused because no one had their hands on her leg, and it\nhad not been in any compromising position during the very quick\nphysical contact. Staff 4 recalled that staff were able to leave\nYouth A at that point. She did not believe she ever saw any marks\nor bruises on Youth A. She also stated that she never saw any\nstaff hit or push or strike Youth A in any unsafe or inappropriate\nmanner.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Video footage of 09/21/2023 capturing the escalation and\nrestraint of Youth A was reviewed. The footage starts with\nthe same view as the day prior of the empty west wing unit\nhallway. Youth A was interacting with Staff 4 and Staff 4\nleft the frame and Youth A appeared to become more and\nmore upset. Youth A proceeded to hit a hand sanitizer\ndispenser on the wall causing the front portion of it to fall\nand open up. Youth A then briefly stood against the\nopposite wall only to then appear to yell and fall to her\nknees. Staff 3 and Staff 1 then entered the hallway and\nattempted to restrain Youth A. Staff 3 held Youth A by the\narms behind her and Staff 1 initially attempted to pick up\nYouth A’s legs, only to set her back down. The three\nindividuals then leave the frame and were next seen from a\nsecurity camera that captures a common area in between\nthe east and west units. Staff 3 was seen escorting Youth\nA from behind and Youth A was walking under her own\npower, with Staff 1 following them from behind. Youth A\nthen attempted to grab on to a support pole only to have\nStaff 3 pull her away. Youth A then grabbed the next\nsupport pole and while still standing had her hand pulled off\nby Staff 4. Once that occurs Staff 3 and Youth A then walk\nout of frame to the entrance of the east wing of units at the\n9",
    "facility. This security camera had an obscured view of the\nindividuals at that point. Youth A was escorted to her new\nroom by Staff 3 and Staff 2 was seen closely following, with\nStaff 4 standing next to the bedroom door. The end of the\ninteraction where Youth A was placed in the suicide watch\nroom was not able to be captured shortly after the end of\nthis last security footage.\n• A police report from the Hampton Township Police\nDepartment dated 10/12/2023 was provided. In it the\nreporting officer stated that he came to the facility on\n09/21/2023 at 10:51 am after the incidents with Youth A\nconcluded. The officer interviewed Youth A and Youth A\nstated that the night prior Staff 1 had hit her on her left arm\nand that same morning Staff 3 had picked her up and\nsqueezed her tightly.\no Photographs of Youth As right left and right arm\nwere taken on 09/21/2023 by law enforcement and\nsmall bruising can be seen in both photographs.\no It was confirmed on 10/24/2023 that the county\nprosecutor had declined to pursue charges against\nany individuals involved in the incidents.\n• Internal documentation describing the morning of\n09/21/2023 of Youth A’s placement was reviewed. There\nare several occasions where Youth A was quoted cussing\nat or threatening staff members. At 6:30 am it was noted\nthat Youth A was offered a shower and she initially refused,\nonly to then change her mind. Once Youth A left her room\nshe then sat down and further refused to follow staff\ndirectives for taking a shower. It was described that Youth\nA escalated further to the point of threatening to punch staff\nand then attempting to destroy property by breaking the\nhand sanitizer dispenser.\n• An incident report dated 09/21/2023 was reviewed. This\ndescribed the series of events that caused staff to decide to\nplace Youth A in a restraint. It was described that Staff 3\ninitially attempted a “cradle assist” hold with Youth A, only\nfor her to struggle to the point where he decided to use a\n“cradle carry” hold to move her from one unit to another. It\nwas described that Staff 3 let Youth A go and allowed her\nto sit on the floor once in the other unit and he backed up to\ngive her space. After time spent attempting to de-escalate\nYouth A and her continued escalation it was decided that\nStaff 3 and Staff 2 would use a “hook transport” hold to\nmove Youth A into the new bedroom. Further details in this\nincident report are consistent with what was provided in\ninterviews with youth and staff.\n10",
    "• Policy & procedures for the facility tiled “Emergency\nRestraint” last dated August 2023 was reviewed. It\ndescribed procedures for the attempt of de-escalating youth\nprior to the use of physical management. In addition, it\ndescribed the point in time where physical management\ncan occur as when “all other interventions are utilized but\nfail to protect the youth or others from unanticipated or\nseverely aggressive behavior that places the youth or\nothers at serious threat of violence or injury if no immediate\nintervention occurs.”\n• Policy & procedures for the facility tiled “Suicide Threats or\nAttempts” last dated May 2023 was reviewed. It described\nprocedures for staff in response to a youth who expresses\nthoughts or desire to self harm, including calmly discussing\nthe circumstances surrounding the thoughts with the youth\nas well as inquiring if the youth is willing to make a\ncommitment to not harm themselves. It also stated that\n“physical emergency intervention shall be utilized as\nnecessary” in response to suicidal behaviors.\nAnalysis Through interviews of youth and staff, documentation and video\nfootage reviewed there is not sufficient evidence that any rules\nwere violated in the physical management of Youth A on\n09/21/2023.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• Over the course of the evening of 09/20/2023 and in to the\nmorning of 09/21/2023 there was discussion among staff of\nassessing the need for closer supervision of Youth A\nbecause of her statements about the desire to self-\nharm. At that point in the night the facility did not have the\nuse of it’s designated room to serve this purpose and it was\nstated in staff interviews that this intervention could be used\nto help Youth A the following day. Any intervention to aid in\nensuring the safety of a youth, such as the use of seclusion\nor removing personal items from them, would need to be\njustified to use in the moment and not be used because it\nwas justified previously and not available at that time.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms\nof intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n11",
