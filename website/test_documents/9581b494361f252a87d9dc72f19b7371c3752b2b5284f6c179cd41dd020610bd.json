    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not provide therapy, trauma assessments, and\ncomplete a guardianship as recommended.\nInvestigation I interviewed Complainant 1 by telephone on 3/06/2023.\nComplainant 1 stated Sibling Group 1 had been in care 3-4 years\nand the relative caregiver has recently requested removal of the\nchildren. Complainant 1 reported no therapy and trauma\nassessments have been provided and a guardianship has not yet\nbeen established.\nI reviewed 5 Updated Service Plans (USP's) and 4 Parent Agency\nTreatment Plans (PATP's). The service plans and Parent Agency\nAgreements indicated assessments of needs/strengths were\nbeing completed along with action steps/expectations of how\nidentified problems were to be resolved. However there appeared\nto be a lack of follow up in monitoring the referrals for services that\nwere made to confirm the services were being provided to resolve\nthe identified barriers. A significant part of the permanency\nplanning goal for this group of siblings was the goal of establishing\na guardianship with the relative caregiver of this sibling group.\nUSP's and PATP's from 2/28/2022 to 02/15/2023 were reviewed.\nThey indicated that the mother of this sibling group was\npermanently disabled, terminally ill, and unable to care for the\nchildren but she was unwilling to agree to the establishment of a\nguardianship for the children. The mother had\nreceived/completed a psychological evaluation, but she refused to\nfollow the recommendations of both her physical and mental\nhealth care providers. A court hearing 8/2/2022 indicated the\nguardianship was pending but a home study, fingerprinting, and\nassistance programs/clearances were needed to be completed\nand submitted to the court for approval. A court hearing\n1/17/2023 reported the action steps necessary for the\nestablishment of a guardianship had not yet been completed.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 by telephone on 5/4/2023.\nAdministrator 1 stated this sibling group case has been transferred\nto another office of the agency. Administrator 1 stated the agency\nis having a difficult time to be adequately staffed and the changes\nin caseworkers contributed to the lack of follow up regarding the\nservices in this case.\nMy review of the information record identified at least 3 different\ncaseworkers for this case from 2/17/22 to 2/3/23.\n2",
    "Analysis The findings of this investigation determined the agency identified\nareas of needs and services to address those needs. The records\nalso indicated referrals for some services were made but there\nwas a lack of follow up to ensure the services were being provided\nas needed.
