    "III. INVESTIGATION\nPublic Act MCL 722.111 Definitions:\n116 of 1973, (x) “Minor child” means any of the following:\nas amended. (iii) A person who is a resident in a child caring institution,\nEffective children’s camp, foster family home, or foster family group home;\n3/28/18 who becomes 18 years of age while residing in a child caring\ninstitution, children’s camp, foster family home, or foster family\ngroup home; and who continues residing in a child caring\ninstitution, children’s camp, foster family home, or foster family\ngroup home to receive care, maintenance, training, and\nsupervision. A minor child under this subparagraph does not\ninclude a person 18 years of age or older who is placed in a child\ncaring institution, foster family home, or foster family group home\nunder an adjudication under section 2(a) of chapter XIIA of the\nprobate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, or under\nsection 1 of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA\n175, MCL 769.1.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Minors from the CCI mix with adults in another program on-site.\nInvestigation Ozone House is the parent agency for a non-MDHHS homeless\nshelter serving youths and adults located in a multi-level\nresidential building in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The licensed child\ncaring institution on the second and third floors are part of Ozone\nHouse Youth Shelter referred to as Transitional Living and\nSafestay respectively. The main floor is a homeless shelter for\nadults.\nOn 5/16/23, I interviewed two anonymous Complainants together\nvia telephone. They expressed a concern that Youth I, age 17-\nyears 11-months, is “mixing” with adults who reside in another\nprogram on the main floor.\nI arrived at the facility unannounced on 5/17/23 at 10:40am. and\nfound Youth I sitting in the child caring institution with Staff 1. I\ninterviewed Youth I. She denied “mixing” with the adult residents\non the lower level. However, on 5/21/23 she said she turns 18\nand will be transferring into the adult program.\nI interviewed Youth D. She denied she or other minors ever “mix”\nwith the adult residents adding, “We can’t even say ‘hi’ to them\noutside.”\n2",
    "I interviewed Staff 1. She was working with the youth today, but\nsaid she usually works with the adults. Staff 1 said the minor\nresidents are not allowed to mix with the adults.\nI interviewed Director. She explained that youths over age 17-\nyears, 6-months old sleep in Safestay but do participate in adult\nprogramming daily from 3 – 11pm. Director said the organization\nhas not experienced any negative outcomes as result of the partial\nmixed programming for teens nearing adulthood.\nAnalysis Youths over age 17 years 6 months sleep in the program for\nminors and participate in partial day programming with adults from\n3 - 11pm. Nothing in Public Act 116 or the Child Caring Licensing\nRules prohibits this.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4123 Education\nSection (2) Provision shall be made for an appropriate education program\nDescription in accordance with 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1853. Each\nresident of school age shall be enrolled not later than 5 school\ndays after admission and continuously thereafter.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A youth was not enrolled in school within five days of placement at\nthe facility.\nInvestigation The Complainants reported Youth D is not enrolled in school.\nRecords indicate Youth D entered the facility on 4/20/23. On\nWednesday 5/16/23 at 10:50am I found her in her room. I\ninterviewed Youth D. She said she is not enrolled in school\nbecause the high school she last attended in Ohio does not offer\nvirtual learning. “Case manager is trying to figure out something.\nI don’t think they wanted me to go (to school) since I won’t be here\nthat long.”\nI reviewed progress notes by Case Manager pertaining to Youth\nD’s education. A note dated 4/21/23 indicates options for\nschooling were discussed. Youth plans to go to Job Corps in\nJune but is open to enrolling in school if she stays (at Safestay) for\nan extended period of time. A note dated 4/28/23 indicates Youth\nD is not sure about school and is considering enrolling in Ypsilanti\n3",
    "High School. On 5/9/23 a note indicated the potential of getting\nyouth into WAVE school was discussed. Youth requested to\nattend Ypsilanti High School and was told it is not an option.\nYouth expressed being very eager to get into school.\nI interviewed Case Manager via phone on 5/18/23 who shared a\nverbal update regarding Youth D’s education. Initially she said\nYouth D’s mother was a barrier to her school enrollment.\nHowever, since then, the mother gave Case Manager and Ozone\nHouse permission to enroll her. Online options were explored, but\nthe programs were not accepting enrollments this late in the\nschool year. Case Manager said Youth D is currently on a waiting\nlist for WAVE school and that she and Youth D are meeting with\nACE school on 5/19/23 to explore enrollment possibilities there.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nIf youth cannot be enrolled in school within 5 days of placement,\nall failed efforts to enroll her should be documented in the youth’s\nfile.\nAnalysis Documentation shows failed efforts to enroll Youth D, but schools\nwere not accepting new enrollments as it was too late in the\nschool year.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(d) Storage of medications.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Medication is stored haphazardly. Medication from discharged\nyouths and expired over-the-counter medication has not been\ndisposed of.\nInvestigation Complainants alleged that medication is stored in a disorganized\nmanner. There is medication leftover from previous residents and\nsome expired medication remains in the cabinet.\nI observed the medication cabinet to be locked. Staff 1 unlocked\nthe cabinet. Prescribed medication is stored on the right side of\nthe cabinet. Each youth has their own plastic bin. There was no\n4",
    "medication leftover from discharged residents and none of the\nprescription medication was expired.\nI observed the over-the-counter medication stored on the left side\nof the cabinet. Most of it was expired. I recommended Director\npromptly remove the expired medication. On 5/18/23, Director\nreported that all expired medication was disposed of and would be\nreplaced with new medication.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nStored over the counter medication should be checked monthly for\nexpiration dates and all expired medication should be promptly\ndisposed of.\nAnalysis Prescription medication was stored in an organized manner in\nseparate plastic bins for each youth. There was no medication\nleftover from previous residents. While it is best practice to do so,\nthere is no licensing rule requiring immediate disposal of over-the-\ncounter medication.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Dispensed medication is not always documented appropriately.\nStaff are not uniformly trained in medication dispensing and\ndocumentation.\nInvestigation Complainants alleged that dispensed medication is not always\ndocumented appropriately and not all staff are trained in\nmedication dispensing or documentation.\nI reviewed the April and May 2023 medication logs. Youth D has\na topical cream that is prescribed “as needed,” which she has not\nused/needed since April. Youths M and H have prescribed\nmedications that were dispensed in May 2023. The top portion of\nthe medication administration records (MARs) were not fully filled\nout. There were empty spaces on Youth H’s MAR on May 7 & 8\n5",
    "suggesting either the medication was not dispensed, staff\ndispensed it and failed to initial the box, or the youth refused it.\nI reviewed staff training logs. All 17 training logs showed that\nsome form of initial medication training and annual refresher\ntrainings were completed. The annual refresher trainings are only\n20 – 30 minutes in duration.\nI asked Medication Trainer via email if staff are specifically trained\non how to start a MAR. She confirmed that that is included in their\ntraining.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nAlthough Medication Trainer said the staff are trained how to fill\nout the top portion of monthly MARs, at least one MAR was not\nfilled out thoroughly. This leads to confusion for the medication\ndispenser and for the supervisor monitoring accuracy of MARs. I\nrecommend that only supervisors or persons who clearly\ndemonstrate an ability to fill them out thoroughly and correctly be\nassigned to start each youth’s MAR upon admission and monthly\nthereafter by filling out the top portion.\nTo prevent medication errors, supervisors or lead staff should\ncheck MARs before the end of the day and afternoon shifts to\nassure all prescribed medications were dispensed and properly\ndocumented.\nThe agency’s annual medication refresher training is brief and\nmay require more than 20 – 30 minutes.\nAnalysis At least one MAR was not filled out thoroughly or correctly. Two\nmedication documentation errors were found on Youth H's MAR\nfor May 2023.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4152 Initial documentation\nSection (1) At the time of admission, all of the following shall be in the\nDescription resident’s case record:\n(a) Name, address, birth date, gender, race, height, weight, hair\ncolor, eye color, identifying marks, religious preference, and\nschool status.\n(b) A photograph taken within the previous 12 months.\n6",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Necessary identifying information of youths is not always readily\navailable to direct care staff on each shift as needed.\nInvestigation Complainants expressed concern that necessary identifying\ninformation of youths is not always readily available to direct care\nstaff on nights and weekends.\nThe facility chooses to keep two different case files for youth. One\n“hard” file that is locked in the case managers’ offices and another\n“soft” file for use by the direct care staff. The “soft” file is a subset\nof the “hard” file. It is the case managers’ responsibility to copy\ncertain documents and provide them to direct care staff, who in\nturn, assemble the “soft” files. I reviewed the “soft” files of Youths\nI, D, H and M. Youths H and M did not have face sheets\n(identifying data) and photos necessary for direct care staff to\nhave in the event of an AWOL or emergency. Youths I and D had\nidentifying data but were also missing photos.\nCONSULTATION\nI recommend there only be one case file that all staff have access\nto 24/7.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nIf the agency chooses to keep dual files, the supervisor of case\nmanagers needs to check behind them to assure all necessary\ndocuments were provided to direct care staff to create the soft file.\nDirect care staff should have access to the face sheet, a recent\nphoto of the youth, consent to treatment forms, safety plans,\ninsurance cards, emergency contacts and other documents.\nAnalysis (a) Two of four youth files were missing face sheets containing\nidentifying data.\n(b) Four of four files were missing a photograph taken within the\nprevious 12 months.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nInterim Inspection 10/14/2021 with approved CAP (sub-rule a)\n7",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nMay 30, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 6, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n8"
