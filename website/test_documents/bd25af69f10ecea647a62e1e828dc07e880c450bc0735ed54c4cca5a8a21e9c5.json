She\nstated there had been inappropriate touching going on between\nher and another youth placed at the program. Youth A stated\nYouth B had been touching her and laying on top of her. Youth A\nnoted this happened on several occasions, and that one notable\ntime was when she and Youth B were in another youth’s room.\nYouth A stated this was the last time that inappropriate touching\nhad occurred. Youth A clarified that she and Youth B were\nupstairs and that there were no staff upstairs with them, but that\nstaff were downstairs. Youth A believed this had occurred during\nan evening either on Thanksgiving day or during that\nThanksgiving weekend. She stated she had not told staff at the\nprogram because she was scared to. Youth A then stated she did\ntell Chief Administrator and Staff 2. Youth A recalled she was\nsitting on the bed of Youth D in another bedroom because she\nwas sad that this other youth was not at the program anymore.\nYouth A stated she was initially alone in the room. Youth A\nrecalled that Youth B came into the room and sat on the bed and\nthen laid on top of Youth A without Youth A asking her to do so.\nYouth A recalled that Youth B moved her hands near Youth A’s\nbreast and lower leg.

She stated she has never touched Youth A when staff\nwere not around. Youth B stated there is now a rule that she\ncannot be around Youth A because Youth A said that Youth B had\nlaid on her. Youth B stated she has never been in a room together\nwith Youth A without staff.

She stated that Youth A was\n4",
    "sitting “criss cross applesauce” on Youth D’s bed, and that Youth\nB came in and gave her a hug and then left. She believed this\noccurred on one night over Thanksgiving weekend, and it was\nafter bedtime. Youth B believed that Staff 1 was the staff that was\nupstairs, but that she was in another room and did not see Youth\nA or Youth B. Youth B recalled that this was a short interaction,\nand that Youth A never asked her to stop.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 12/05/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit at the facility. Staff 1\nstated she has interacted with both Youth A and Youth B together\nduring their time placed in the program. She also stated that she\nhas served as the one on one staff for both youth.

She stated she was aware of the\nallegations between Youth A and Youth B because Youth A had\nmade her aware of them over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.\nThe Chief Administrator described a conversation with Youth A\nthat included details of the alleged incident that were consistent\nwith what Youth A provided. The Chief Administrator stated after\nher conversation with Youth A, Youth A told everyone in the house\nthe same allegations later in the afternoon when Youth B was not\npresent. Chief Administrator recalled Youth A stating that was her\nopinion that this had occurred because staff were not supervising\n5",
    "correctly. Youth A elaborated to the Chief Administrator that staff\nwere in the other room and not aware of where the youth were in\nthe upstairs bedrooms. Chief Administrator stated Youth A was\nnot able to pinpoint a specific day, time or staff that would have\nbeen responsible at that time this alleged incident occurred. Chief\nAdministrator confirmed Youth A had been assigned a one on one\nstaff for the majority of the time placed at the program, far before\nthe time of the alleged incident, but could not state who this staff\nmember would have been without proper documentation or a date\nto pinpoint when it occurred. The Chief Administrator believed that\nall staff were well aware of this situation but stated that there were\nno written documents regarding safety planning in response to the\nsituation despite everyone agreeing that Youth A and Youth B\nneeded to stay apart from each other.\nLicensee Designee was interviewed on 12/15/2023 over video\nconference with DHHS Worker 1. Licensee Designee stated that\nshe believed Staff 1 was on shift when the alleged incident\nbetween Youth B and Youth A had occurred. Licensee Designee\nbelieved that Youth A had later told a staff member, she could not\nremember who, that she had lied about the incident with Youth B\nto get Youth B in trouble. Licensee Designee stated that Youth A\nshould have had one on one supervision during the time that the\nincident occurred, but she could not say who this staff would have\nbeen.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Documentation from the foster care case record of Youth A\nwas reviewed. Approval for 16 hours per day of One-to-\none supervision provided by the program directly with\nYouth A and Youth B separately was authorized as of\n08/30/2023 and 10/18/2023 respectively and continued for\nthe duration of their placements.\n• A section of the overall policies & procedures from the\nfacility titled “Care & Safety” was reviewed. This policy\nstated that “The primary job of all staff is to maintain\nadequate coverage and line of sight of all youth at all times.\nThis means that youth are never left unattended for any\namount of time so that behaviors are supervised. HOLA will\nhave two staff members maintain line of sight during wake\nhours.”\n• There was not clear documentation able to be provided by\nthe agency regarding the specific staff who were acting as\nthe enhanced supervision for either Youth A or Youth B on\nany given date or time.\n6",
    "• Security camera footage spanning the dates of 11/22/2023\nthrough 11/26/2023 specifically of the upstairs hallway was\nviewed. This camera captures the entryways of all the\nyouth’s bedrooms in the facility. Footage for this timespan\nonly included twenty second clips and not a continuous\ntimeframe. In addition, exact times of each clip could not\nbe identified. In the available video footage, there was not\na moment found that showed Youth A and Youth B entering\nthe same room that could have approximated the alleged\nincident. The video footage showed some youth coming\nand going from bedrooms and staff generally nearby but\nincluded occasions that staff would not have been able to\nhave continuous line of sight view of the youth. No one was\never in view long enough to determine their level of\nsupervision.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed, evidence was found that supervision was not provided\nfor Youth A or Youth B to the level stated in facility policy and\nagreed upon with their respective case management, resulting in\nthe alleged incident in question not being able to be confirmed by\na staff member supervising either youth.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• Clear and consistent documentation of who is providing\nenhanced supervision for a youth at any given time is\nsomething the facility will need to design and implement.\nConsultation provided:\n• Ease of access and familiarity with the facility’s chosen\nsecurity camera system would be of benefit in order to\nmore quickly and easily provide video footage when\nneeded as well as to review video footage of incidents for\ncoaching and training.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms\nof intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(iv) Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative\nreferences to a youth’s background or appearance\n7",

Staff 1 denied ever\nsaying anything inappropriate or anything close to what Youth A\nhad quoted during Youth A’s time placed at the program.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 12/05/2023\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit at the facility.

Youth C stated\nshe has not heard Staff 1 say anything inappropriate towards any\nof the other youth in the program, nor towards herself.\n8",
    "Analysis Through interviews with youth and staff there was no sufficient\nevidence found that staff have used discriminatory language\ntoward youth in the program.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• More training and focus on how to communicate with youth\nin a trauma informed manner would benefit staff and likely\nbetter build rapport with youth and reduce escalations and\nincidents.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing a youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A was hit in the foot by a crutch held by the Chief\nAdministrator.\nInvestigation Youth A was interviewed on 11/30/2023 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit to her school.

Chief Administrator recalled the\nincident in question regarding Youth A and being hit with one of\nChief Administrator crutches. She stated Youth A was escalated\non the morning in question before all the youth went to school.\nThe Chief Administrator recalled staying in between Youth A and\nthe sliding door that goes between the dining area and the staff\noffice to prevent her from going inside the office. The Chief\nAdministrator stated her crutch bumped into Youth A’s foot\nunintentionally. The Chief Administrator did not believe that there\nwas much force behind this contact between her crutch and Youth\nA’s foot. The Chief Administrator recalled stating “I’m sorry” to\n9",
    "Youth A when this occurred. The Chief Administrator believed that\nLicensee Designee was present and witnessed the incident.

The Chief Administrator’s response was calm,\nstating she did not hit Youth A with her crutch, and she had\nno intent of hurting Youth A.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documents reviewed,\nthere was no evidence found that Chief Administrator hit Youth A\nwith her crutch in a malicious manner or caused injury.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4130 Privacy and confidentiality.\nSection (1) An institution shall assure resident and parent privacy and\nDescription confidentiality and shall protect residents from exploitation.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth B has not been afforded proper privacy in her assigned\nbedroom.\nInvestigation Youth B was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 12/05/2023\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at her school. She\nstated a recent rule was put into place that she was not allowed to\nhave her bedroom door closed, and this provided her stress in that\nshe felt like she was not able to have the privacy that she needed.\nIn addition, Youth B stated concern that there was a security\ncamera recently installed in the hallway outside of her bedroom\ndoor that she felt pointed directly into her bedroom. Youth B also\nstated there is a closet inside of her bedroom that is used for\n10",

This upset Youth B because she felt like her privacy\nwas violated.\nStaff 2 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 12/05/2023\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit at the facility. Staff 2\nacknowledged that she had entered Youth B’s room that morning\nbut denied that this occurred when Youth B was changing her\nclothes. Staff 2 stated there is a closet located inside that\nbedroom where Youth B was residing, and that closet was used to\nstore various items for the whole program.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Footage of the security camera placed outside of Youth B’s\nroom was viewed and it was noted that it does not shoot\ndirectly inside of the bedroom.\nAnalysis Through interviews of youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed, there was not sufficient evidence found for a rule\nviolation.\nConsultation provided:\n• Reconsideration should be made to the use of a closet for\nthe storage of program items within a youth’s bedroom.\nEnsuring the privacy and physical and emotional safety of\nyouth placed in the program should not be prioritized less\nthan ease of access or lack of storage space within the\nbuilding.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n11",
