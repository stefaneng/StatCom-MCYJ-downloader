INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction, prevention;\nTitle prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159\nSection (2) The following restraints are strictly prohibited:\nDescription (e) Restraining youth in a prone position or any restraint\nthat restricts the youth’s airway.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was restrained in a prone position.\nInvestigation Youth B was interviewed on 02/08/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit at the facility. Youth B recalled witnessing an\nincident where Youth A was restrained face down on the ground\nfor a “long time.” Youth B believed this occurred prior to\nThanksgiving the year before. Youth B did not recall any other\ndetails from the alleged incident. This investigation was initiated\nby DCWL because of this interview.\nYouth A was interviewed by Consultant 2 at his current placement\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit on 03/05/2024. Youth A\nstated he recalled the incident at the facility, but also stated he\nhas anxiety and blacked out during parts of the incident. Youth A\nstated he told Staff 6 he was going outside to walk around the\nhouse. Youth A stated he banged on the locked door when he\ncould not re-enter. Youth A stated he sat down to watch television\nbut had thoughts of beating Staff 6. Youth A stated he told Staff 6,\n“I should hate you, but my dad said not to hit females.” Youth A\nstated he got up and went back outside and walked around\ncampus. Youth A stated Staff 3, Staff 6, and Staff 7 followed him\naround campus causing more anger. Youth A stated he thought\nabout breaking Staff 6’s car window with a log he found. Youth A\nstated instead he headed back to the house to talk with another\nyouth, but Staff 3 blocked the door to the house. Youth A stated\nhe became mad and ran around the house with the log. Youth A\nstated Staff 5 tried to grab the log from him when they were by a\nwindow. Youth A stated he hit Staff 5 in the face. Youth A stated\nhis anxiety increased and Staff 3 and Staff 5 restrained him to the\nground on his stomach. Youth A stated it felt like he was on the\nground for an hour eating dirt before staff tried to get him up on his\nknees. Youth A stated he tried to move out of the hold and was\nplaced back on the ground on his stomach. Youth A stated Staff 6\nand Staff 2 held his legs and Staff 3 and Staff 5 secured his arms.\n2",
    "Youth A stated someone was on his back but did not know who.\nYouth A stated he was crying and did commit to go back to the\nhouse. Youth A stated he wanted a shower. Youth A stated he\nstarted throwing papers and things in his room and Staff 3 and\nStaff 5 blocked his door and restrained him to the ground on his\nstomach. Youth A stated he hit his head on his desk and on the\nfloor in this restraint. Youth A said Staff 5 and Staff 3 secured his\narms and Staff 2 and Staff 6 secured his legs. Youth A stated he\nkicked someone but does not know who. Youth A stated the police\ncame and he went to the hospital. Youth A was asked if he was\nwilling to review certain parts of the incident report and that he\ncould stop if the questions triggered him. Youth A agreed. Youth A\ndoes not recall the other youth who might have witnessed the\nincident. Youth A stated he grabbed Youth C by the collar and\nshoved Youth C to the wall and staff separated them. Youth A\nsaid he tried to climb onto the school’s roof. Youth A denied trying\nto break into cars. Youth A said Staff 5’s car was unlocked, and he\nsat in the car and got out. Youth A stated he did spit in Staff 8’s\nface. He recalled that she assisted in restraining him inside the\nhouse but did not recall details. Youth A did not recall Staff 4\nbeing involved in the incident.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 03/12/2024. She\nrecalled being involved in most of the incident that occurred with\nYouth A. Staff 1 stated Youth A was escalated and moved all\nover campus for some time, attempting to break things and\nscreaming at himself and staff. Staff 1 recalled him stating threats\nof self-harm and physical harm to any staff that was near him.\nStaff 1 recalled the first attempt at restraining Youth A occurring\nafter he punched Staff 5. At that point Staff 1 recalled Staff 5\nattempting a standing one-person restraint of Youth A, only for this\nto quickly devolve when Youth A fought back at Staff 5. Staff 1\nstated she could not recall exactly what happened next other than\nYouth A was fighting often and staff that were involved with him,\nfell to the ground with him. Staff 1 could not recall exactly who\nwas involved. Staff 1 was positive that Youth A going to the\nground was accidental. She could not recall if he fell on his side\nor face down first but recalled he was on his stomach face down\nfor some amount of time. Staff 1 believed Youth A did not have\nany trouble breathing because he was consistently vocal and did\nnot say anything about struggling to breath or being in pain. She\ndid recall Youth A hitting his knee on the way down. Staff 1\nbelieved the other staff involved at this point were Staff 2, Staff 4\nand Staff 7. Staff 1 could not recall how long this part of the\nincident lasted but stated she was also involved with Youth A\nwhen he had to be restrained later in the evening. Staff 1 stated\n3",
    "that this occurred inside of his bedroom. She recalled him\npunching doors and walls and that staff were afraid that he would\nhurt himself. Staff 1 could not recall who initiated restraint efforts\nbut believed that this began with a one person standing restraint\nthat was not able to be successful when Youth A fell to the\nground, taking staff with him. At this point Youth A was biting and\nkicking anyone that was near him. Staff 1 did not believe Youth A\nstruggled to breath or had any pain during this part of the restraint.\nShe stated he was on his chest on the floor of his room and this\nrestraint lasted until law enforcement arrived. Law enforcement\nthen was able to speak with Youth A to attempt to de-escalate the\nassaultive and destructive behavior.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone on 03/12/2024. She\nstated she does not work at the facility anymore but recalled the\nincident in question. Staff 2 recalled the first instance of needing\nto restrain Youth A was when he was outside of one of the units\nand had been destructive and assaultive for some time leading up\nto that point. She believed Staff 3 and Staff 5 had to try to start\nthe restraint while Youth A was standing, when Youth A dropped\nto the ground and took the staff members with him. Staff 2\nrecalled Youth A hitting Staff 5 in the face during this portion of the\nincident. Staff 2 stated Youth A fell on his stomach with his face\nto the side. She stated none of the staff involved, including\nherself, attempted to pick up Youth A so he would not be in a\nprone position, nor did they disengage. Staff 2 recalled\ndisengaging was difficult because Youth A was attempting to hit\nanyone he could, and he had a rock in his hand that he was trying\nto throw at a nearby building. Staff 2 could not recall how that\nrestraint attempt ended. She stated she was involved in the\nsecond restraint effort as well. Staff 2 believed this effort was not\nas warranted as outside; in that it was “hurting him more than it\nwas calming him down.” She recalled his room being in disarray\nafter he had caused some property destruction. Staff 2 stated\nthere were already staff members holding Youth A’s shoulders\nwhen she came into the room to assist with holding his legs. She\nbelieved Staff 5 and Staff 4 were holding his shoulders. Staff 2\nconfirmed Youth A was lying face down for this part of the\nrestraint. Staff 2 believed Staff 5 was laying somewhat on top of\nYouth A. At this point Youth A was biting and kicking anyone near\nhim. Staff 2 stated staff attempted to disengage at one point, but\nStaff 5 had hands on Youth A still through this portion of the\nrestraint. Staff 2 recalled being told by other staff, that she could\nnot recall, that they were to hold Youth A on the ground until law\nenforcement arrived. Staff 2 stated Youth A’s energy eventually\ncalmed down. Staff 2 believed it was Staff 3 that was in\n4",
    "communication with Supervisor 1, who had given the direction to\nnot let Youth A go for fear of more destructive and assaultive\nbehavior towards staff. Staff 2 also recalled not feeling like she\nwas trained well in attempting a restraint like this. She recalled\nher restraint training to only exist of role-playing standing holds,\nand they were always taught to never restrain a youth on the\nground in any form.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone on 03/15/2024. He\nrecalled being a part of the escalated incident with Youth A on\n09/28/2023. Staff 3 stated there were hours of activity prior to\nrestraints occurring with Youth A that day, including staff providing\nline of sight and managing the environment for him as he moved\nall over campus and attempted to destroy property and assault\nstaff. Staff 3 stated he could not remember details of the first\nrestraint attempts when Youth A was still outside. He believed\nthat the first attempt at restraining Youth A was when a staff\nmember, he could not remember who, attempted a standing\nrestraint, but Youth A took them both to the ground. Staff 3 stated\nYouth A was on his stomach at this point and did not immediately\nget up because the staff involved did not let go immediately. Staff\n3 never heard Youth A state he was having trouble breathing in\nany form, or that he was in pain. Staff 3 only recalled Youth A\ncontinued with threatening and aggressive statements throughout\nthe restraint episode. Staff 3 could not recall exactly how the\nrestraint ended but did recall Youth A ended up inside. Staff 3\nwas not involved in the second instance of restraining Youth A\ninside because he was outside the unit waiting for law\nenforcement to arrive.\nStaff 4 was interviewed over the phone on 03/18/2024. She\nrecalled the incident in question. Staff 4 stated she did not\nprimarily work in the same unit as Youth A but was called over for\nassistance when the restraint began outside of his unit. She\nrecalled Youth A throwing punches at staff and threatening them,\nas well as making self-harm statements. She could not recall\nexactly which staff were also involved, but she stated the first\nthing she saw was staff attempting a standing restraint of Youth A.\nShe recalled seeing Youth A drop his weight to the ground, taking\nstaff to the ground with him. Staff 4 stated Youth A was then\nlaying on his stomach for a short amount of time before he got up\non his own power when he committed to safety. Staff 4 stated\nsometime later, Youth A slammed his bedroom door and was\npresumably destroying property in his room, as well as attempting\nto barricade himself in there. Staff 4 stated another staff member\nthat she could not recall, was able to gain access to the room.\n5",
    "This was attempted because there is a policy against closed\nbedroom doors and there was active concern for Youth A\nattempting to harm himself if not supervised and possibly\nintervened with. Staff 4 recalled Youth A throwing punches\ntowards staff at this point and another standing restraint was\nattempted, only for Youth A and the staff involved to fall to the\nfloor again. Staff 4 stated she was trained in never performing\nrestraints when youth were on the ground, but it was decided in\nthis instance to perform an “emergency floor restraint” because of\nthe severity of Youth A’s aggressive behaviors. As an example of\nbehavior, Staff 4 stated she was bit by Youth A during this\nphysical escalation. Staff 4 recalled Youth A was on his stomach\nduring this portion of the restraint. She was not sure when he de-\nescalated overall other than several attempts by staff to disengage\nwith Youth A, only for him to immediately destroy property or try to\nassault staff which caused them to re-engage while he was on the\nfloor.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Because of the extended time since the incident occurred,\nvideo footage was not able to be produced by the facility.\n• An Incident Report authored on 09/29/2023 regarding the\n09/28/2023 incident involving Youth A was provided. In this\ndocumentation there is narrative describing significantly\nescalated, assaultive and destructive behavior on the part\nof Youth A. The beginning of the documentation refers to\napproximately 7:05 pm as when Youth A began to\nescalate. This all described the staff’s reasoning for\nattempting to restrain Youth A on two different occasions,\nonce outside at approximately 8:45 pm and then again\ninside at 10:10 pm. Law enforcement arrived and were\nable to transport Youth A to the hospital for medical\nattention related to his suicidal comments.\n• Facility policy titled “Prevention Techniques for Overnight\nStaff” was provided and reviewed. In this policy it stated for\nstaff to “make sure that all bedroom doors are wide open\n(students are NOT permitted to close bedroom doors).”\n• Facility policy titled “NVCI Training for Physical\nIntervention” was reviewed. The facility utilizes the\napproved Non-Violent Crisis Intervention restraint\nmodel. In this policy it was described that:\no “In the event that a restraint ends up on the floor due\nto the student struggling the staff have the following\noptions:\n1. Disengage the youth. If the youth is still\nexhibiting dangerous behaviors and meets\n6",
    "the criteria for physical management, staff\nare able to renegade the student once he\nstands up.\n2. Help bring the student back up to his knees\nor a standing position. This needs to be\ndone without the use of force i.e. dragging or\npulling the student to one of these positions).\n3. If a student begins to struggle while in an\nescort or team control, staff can utilize one of\nthe escort positions that allow for the student\nto be in a seated position.\n4. In extenuating circumstances students may\nbe transitioned to a supine position per the\nNVCI advanced skills. This should only be\nused in situations where the first three\noptions are not viable and safety issues\nnecessitate this move.”\no The restraint policy provides descriptions for three\nrestraint holds:\n▪ Team Control Position as a standing restraint\ninvolving two staff members standing at the\nside of a youth, holding the youth’s shoulders\nfrom the back and extending the youths arms\nacross their bodies and holding at the wrist.\n▪ Emergency Floor Holding - Supine as a\nrestraint where a youth is laying on their back\non the ground, and three staff hold their\nshoulders and arms respectively.\n▪ Emergency Floor Holding - Supported Prone\nas a restraint where a youth is laying on their\nfront on the ground and three staff hold their\nshoulders and arms respectively.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was evidence found to show that Youth A was\nrestrained in a prone position during two different parts of the\nescalated incident that occurred on 09/28/2023 and staff did not\nimmediately disengage.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility is advised to update their restraint training\nmaterials and policy to eliminate any positions or mentions\nof a youth in a prone position on the ground. In addition,\nreview and editing of restraint training should occur to\nclarify what kinds of restraint efforts would be approved for\nyouth on the ground in a supine position so that staff are\n7",
    "confident in the moment when they need to attempt to\nperform this restraint.\n• The facility is advised to focus training on their chosen\nrestraint model to ensure that rule 400.4159 (6) is met even\nduring the most escalated incidents, allowing youth to be\nrestrained only for the minimal time needed for the youth to\ncalm down and restore safety.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2023C0000338 approved 05/02/2023. CAP approved\n05/22/2023.\nRule Code Health status assessment; notification; debriefing; reporting.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4163\nSection (5) An agency will provide an incident report on a form\nDescription prescribed by the department for each incident involving\nthe use of seclusion or restraint. The initial report shall be\nsubmitted to the department within 24 hours of the\nincident occurring. A final incident report shall be\nsubmitted no later than 72 hours after the incident has\noccurred.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Documentation for this incident was inaccurate.\nInvestigation There were consistent recollections in all interviews with youth\nand staff for this investigation of Youth A being on the ground on\ntwo separate points in time during the 09/28/2023 incident. All\nindividuals interviewed recalled Youth A being on his stomach in a\nprone position without staff immediately disengaging or Youth A\ngetting up from the ground.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• In the Incident Report authored on 09/29/2023 that\ndescribed the 09/28/2023 incident with Youth A, multiple\nrestraint attempts are described. The only technical term\nused to describe these attempts was Youth A was put in\nthe Team Control Position multiple times, and on each\nattempt the restraint attempts fell to the ground. Staff\nattempted to disengage and verbally de-escalate Youth A\nat the same time. It is not stated in any part of the Incident\nReport that Youth A was ever in a prone position during\nthese restraint attempts that went to the ground.\n8",
    "Analysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was evidence to find the Incident Report written for\nthe 09/28/2023 incident involving Youth A did not contain accurate\ninformation.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Based on the findings in this report a CAP is required.\nPer SIR # 2024C0000983SI, a 1st provisional license is recommended.\n03/18/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/11/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n9"
