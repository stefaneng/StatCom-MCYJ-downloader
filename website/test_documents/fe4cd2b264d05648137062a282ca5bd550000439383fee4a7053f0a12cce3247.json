    "physical management hold and specific interactions between\nYouth A, Youth B, and staff cannot be clearly viewed.\nDocumentation\nFormer Staff, Staff 1 and Staff 3 wrote incident reports dated\n11/25/2024 that coincide with their interviews except Staff 3’s\nincident report stated Youth B secured the unit keys and Staff 4\ngrabbed them from Youth B.\nYouth A does not have a nursing note following this 11/25/2025\nincident because law enforcement transported her to the hospital.\nYouth A’s hospital discharge paperwork dated 11/25/2024 states\nYouth A has a small bruise on her forearm.

Opposite the unit door is a large wall window.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance because it cannot be\ndetermined how Youth A obtained the bruise on her forearm as\ndocumented in her hospital discharge paperwork. Youth A did not\nstate she was bruised in this incident.\nYouth A alleged Staff 4 scratched the top of her left hand and\ncaused it to bleed. Staff 1 recalled seeing the top of Youth A’s left\nmiddle finger bleed from this incident. The hospital discharge\npaperwork does not indicate Youth A with a scratch or blood on\nher left hand. It cannot be definitively determined how or if Youth\nA received a scratch on her the top of her left hand during this\nincident.\n6",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nEmployee policy and procedure manual states “Personal cell\nphone use is only permitted during scheduled breaks and are not\nallowed while in the presence of clients in any residential\nprogram.” It is recommended for Vista Maria to clearly state if staff\nare permitted to wear air pods on the unit, which may be\nconnected to a smart watch and impact youth supervision.\nEmployee policy and procedure manual states “Dress\nappropriately for the job by wearing agency approved uniforms,\nand/or clothing appropriate for the work being performed.” It is\nrecommended for Vista Maria to require staff to place personal\nitems like outdoor coats, purses, backpacks etc. in their locker and\nnot be permitted on the unit.

    "Former Staff (FS) was interviewed on 02/03/2025 by phone. FS\nstated he and Staff 2 secured Youth A in a two-person standing\nhold when Youth A became argumentative and aggressive\ntowards Staff 2 and would not return something to staff.

Due to\nthe location of the incident, the physical management hold and\nspecific interactions between Youth A and staff cannot be clearly\nviewed.\nDocument Review:\nFormer Staff wrote an incident report on 11/25/2024. It states\nYouth A refused to return an item to staff. Staff attempted to\nretrieve the item. Youth A was physically managed by Former\nStaff and Staff 2 when Youth A began to assault staff.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance when Staff 4 physically\nretrieved her air pod from Youth A’s hand and allegedly scratched\nYouth A’s hand in the process, which escalated Youth A, and\nresulted in physical management of Youth A. Youth A was not a\nrisk to herself or others for having the air pod.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n8",
