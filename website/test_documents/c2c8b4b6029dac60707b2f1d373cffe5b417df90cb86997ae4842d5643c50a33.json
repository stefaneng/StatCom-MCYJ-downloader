Law enforcement requested interviews not occur until\nYouth A was stable and his statement was taken by law enforcement. I\ninterviewed Youth A face to face on 01/12/2023 at Oakland County\nChildren Village. Youth A stated he was placed at Oakland County\nChildren Village on 11/23/2022.

Youth A stated\nhe slept with his mattress on the ground in front of his door during these\nincidents and recalled a male staff opening the door from the hallway\nand the door bumping into his mattress on the ground, but he did not\nwake up enough to see who it was. Youth A stated he does not take\nmedication because he does not need it. Multiple times in the interview\nYouth A said, “I put on an act. Show of crazy. I’ve done six years of\nprison research.” Youth A stated he feels safe at Oakland County\nChildren Village, but his guard is never down. Youth A stated he feels\nsafe because the other residents are calm and a gay resident was\ndischarged.\nSupervisor 1\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face on 01/12/2023 at Oakland\nCounty Children Village.

Supervisor 1\nwas hired on 03/03/2014. Supervisor 1 does not have a discipline\nhistory.\nAnother Department of Health and Human Service agency completed\nan investigation without finding.\nAnalysis Youth A did not state in his interview that he was handcuffed with his\nfeet tied up and sedated and raped on 12/14/2022 at Oakland County\nChildren’s Village. Youth A stated he was confused when he woke up\nwith a “wad” on his buttocks on 12/14/2022 and asked a supervisor with\nangel wings tattoos on his forearms what happened.
