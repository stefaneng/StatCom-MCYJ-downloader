    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 remarked to Complainant in front of Youth J that if Youth J\nhad hit her, Youth J would be on the floor implying a hypothetical\nverbal threat.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Crisis Screener via phone. On 5/5/24 between 2pm\n– 3pm she said she assessed Youth J at Garden City Hospital\nEmergency Room, Bed 30. Crisis Screener said an unidentified\nnurse told her Youth J was in two-point restraints because she hit\nStaff 1.. Staff 1 said to Crisis Screener that if Youth J had hit her,\nYouth J would have been knocked on the floor.\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 5/5/24. She did not\nhave any additional information to provide.\nI notified Foster Care Worker of the investigation assignment.\nShe expressed no licensing concerns.\nI interviewed Youth J at the facility on 5/7/24 with Rights Officer\npresent. She has been at Vista Maria for one day and had been\nat Garden City Hospital for four days for psychiatric reasons\nbefore that. Youth J presented with a flat affect and was easily\ndistracted by noises outside of the room. I pulled the door shut to\nhelp her focus and to decrease the external stimuli.\nI asked Youth J if she knew a Vista Maria staff person named\nStaff 1. She said she did not. She could not concentrate on my\nwords and appeared to be responding to internal stimuli. I asked\nYouth J if she recalled a Vista Maria staff sitting with her at the\n2",
    "hospital and saying something on the order of “if Youth J had hit\nher, she would be on the floor.” Youth J asked, “What?” as if she\nwas unable to focus on the question. Youth J visibly strained to\nconcentrate on my words, and I asked the question again very\ndeliberately focusing on her eyes. This time she responded, “Yes,\na staff said that. But a lot of people say that. It didn’t faze me.” I\nasked Youth J if she viewed Staff 1’s statement as a threat. She\nresponded, “I didn’t feel threatened.” I asked Youth J if Staff 1\nsaid or did anything inappropriate while she sat with Youth J at the\nhospital. Youth J answered, “No.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 with Rights Officer present. She has worked\nat the facility for 11 months. When she was at the hospital\nmonitoring Youth J, Staff 1 said Youth J pushed her arm. “I didn’t\nsay if she had hit me, she’d be on the floor.” Staff 1 denied\nthreatening Youth J in any manner.\nAnalysis Crisis Screener stated Staff 1 made a hypothetical threat toward\nYouth J. Youth J confirmed this but did not consider it a threat.\nStaff 1 denied threatening Youth J in any way. It could not be\ndetermined if Staff 1 made a hypothetical threat toward Youth J.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMay 8, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n3",
