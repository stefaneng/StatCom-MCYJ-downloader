All\nclients will be provided with a copy of the agency’s written\ngrievance process.\nD. CFS will act upon the client grievance in a pre-determined,\ntimely fashion, and clients will be notified and informed during\neach phase of the grievance process.\n5",

In every case the client,\nparent, or guardian shall be given a new copy of the complaint\nprocedure so that clients do not have to rely on information given\nat intake.\nA review of the policy indicates that the agency did not follow (C.)\nas there is no documentation that the Bio-father was provided a\ncopy of the grievance process and instead was referred to the\nagency website for obtaining a grievance form. There is no\ndocumentation that the agency followed (D.), to ensure that the\nBio-father’s concerns were addressed timely and that he was kept\ninformed during each phase of the grievance process. There is no\ndocumentation that the agency followed (F), as there is no written\nevidence that the Bio-father was notified in writing of his right to\nmake a complaint at the time of his complaint.

The grievance form and policy is not on the agency web site\nas acknowledged by the Foster Care Supervisor. I also could not\nfind a copy of the grievance form or procedures on the agency\nweb site.

The Bio-father reported that some of the doctor’s\nappointments for his daughter occur at a clinic in Frankfort,\nMichigan and others occur at the Children’s Hospital of Michigan\nin Detroit. The Bio-father reported that appointments at the\nChildren’s Hospital used to be every three months, then every 6\nmonths, and now every year. The Bio-father reported that he\nattended most of the Children’s Hospital visits by video as Foster\nParent 1 would include him in the video via a cell phone. The Bio-\nfather reported that he would sometimes be notified of the\nChildren’s Hospital visits six days in advance and he was\nfrustrated with this as he felt that Foster Parent 1 knew of the\nscheduled visits well in advance of six days. Another time the Bio-\nfather reported he received a short three day notice for an\nemergency doctor’s visit for his daughter. The Bio-father reported\nshort notice of the appointments made it difficult for him to\nschedule time off from work to attend the appointments.\nThe Bio-father reported that his daughter’s doctor reported that his\ndaughter, at 12 months of age, should no longer be using a bottle\nas this, over time, can cause a misalignment of her teeth. The Bio-\nfather reported that the doctor had said that his daughter should\nbe using a sippy cup instead of a bottle and this was not\noccurring.\nThe Bio-father reported that the agency was not preventing him\nfrom contacting his daughter’s doctor.\n7",
    "Staff 1 Interview: During the interview with Staff 1 she reported\nthat the Bio-father had missed the emergency appointment for his\ndaughter as he was working. Staff 1 reported that the Bio-father\nattended most doctor’s appointments via zoom as he lives in\nManistee and his daughter’s doctor is in Frankfort or at Children’s\nHospital in Detroit. Staff 1 reported that the Bio-father has\ntransportation barriers and therefore attends via zoom.\nStaff 1 reported that Foster Child A was to cease use of a bottle at\n12 months of age.

A Well Child exam dated May 19, 2022,\nrecommends that Foster Child A (age 15 months) discontinue use\nof a bottle. A Well Child exam dated August 15, 2022, documents\nthat Foster Child A, (age 18 months) is only using sippy cups.\nA review of medical appointments did not establish that Foster\nChild A had medical appointments during the month of October\n2022 as reported by the Bio-father.\nSocial Work Contact: A social work contact dated August 17,\n2022, documents an in home, face to face contact between Staff 1\nand Foster Parent 1. The contact documents the Bio-father’s\nconcern with Foster Child A using a bottle. Staff 1 informs Foster\nParent A to cease use of a bottle and Foster Parent 1 stated that\nthe bottle will no longer be used.\nAnalysis The Bio-father reported that he had been attending his daughter’s\nmedical appointments but expressed frustration that he had, at\ntimes, not received enough time in advance of the appointments\nto prepare for time off from work. The Bio-father reported that he\nmissed two appointments in October 2022 however there is no\ndocumented record of medical appointments for Foster Child A in\nOctober 2022. Staff 1 reported that the Bio-father missed one\nappointment as it was an emergency appointment.\nMedical documentation indicates that Foster Child A was removed\nfrom use of a bottle sometime after May 19, 2022.
