Staff 1 reported she had his right arm and placed her knees under his arm and\n3",
    "above his arm; therefore, one of her knees were in range to be hit by his head. Staff 1\nreported Youth A was cussing and threatening them.\nWe interviewed Staff 2.

Staff 2 reported they restrained Youth A on the grass. Youth A\nbegan to bang his head back and forth against their knees. Staff 2 reported they were\non the grass, so this did cause some movement or sliding. Staff 2 reported he did not\nsee anyone hurt Youth A.
