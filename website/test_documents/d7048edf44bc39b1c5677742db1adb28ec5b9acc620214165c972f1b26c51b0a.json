CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation during this review.\n7",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP, approved 4/21/2021, was implemented due to the 3/24/2021 renewal\nevaluation. During this review, four repeat violations were found regarding PATP\nsignatures, medical passports, placement documentation, and service plan approval.\nThe agency acknowledged some difficulty in these areas due to staff shortages and\nanticipates improvement over the next year now that staffing has become more\nstable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) report was reviewed on-site. The CAA\nidentified action steps and review for all areas of the 2021 CAP. Overall the agency\nnoted improvement in several areas, as compliance percentiles improved in the\nmonthly management report. The agency reported meeting with staff on a frequent\nbasis to discuss CAP items and implement new strategies with the assistance of a\nquality improvement/compliance coordinator. The administrator identified some\nchallenges remain, due to being short staffed for several months. Currently the\nagency has a small staff and therefore a smaller number of cases. Once staffing\nincreases, the agency will begin to accept more cases at a slow pace as to not\noverwhelm themselves.\nThe agency acknowledged continued improvement is needed in service plan\ntimeframes, signatures, and uploading documents timely. The agency also reported\ndifficulty obtaining medical/dental paperwork from providers. They are currently\nkeeping a log of contacts to show their attempts to obtain this paperwork.\nInterviews\nThree staff interviews were completed. Staff reported there is a positive atmosphere\namong co-workers and they are able to pull together when needed. Specifically,\nduring a staff shortage, staff were able to count on one another for help when feeling\noverwhelmed. Staff reported their supervisors are very helpful, knowledgeable, and\nable to keep everyone on track. Staff felt confident their supervisors kept them up to\ndate on policy/procedure changes as they happened. Staff reported the agency\nfocused on the CAP a lot over the past year and met frequently about specific areas.\nThe only concern reported by staff is the lack of a program manager at this time, and\nthe strain it put on the supervisors to cover the workload the program manager\nwould normally carry.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST\nThe DCWL Analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert:\n8",
    "An unlicensed relative caregiver had water-stained ceiling tiles, due to a water leak\nfrom the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom sink is the suspected source of the leak.\nThe water to the sink was turned off prior to the analyst’s visit.\nResolution:\nThe agency was aware of the issue and previously requested a quote from the\nrelative, in order to access FIG funds and financially assist with the repair. The\nrelative obtained a quote for a roof repair. However, a leak investigation determined\nthe roof was not the issue, and repair was needed at the bathroom sink. The relative\nreplaced the stained ceiling tiles and obtained one quote for the sink repair. As FIG\nrequires two repair quotes, the agency continued to request a second quote from the\ncaregiver. However, the caregiver reported having difficulty obtaining a second\nquote, despite assistance from the agency. A referral was provided to the caregiver\nfor community resources to assist with the repair. The caregiver has since become\nnon-responsive to the agency regarding this issue. The agency verified during a\nhome visit that a second bathroom is available in the home. Family members also\nuse the bathtub faucet in the affected bathroom, for hand washing. As the water to\nthe broken sink is turned off and no longer leaking, and the family has access to\nwater in that bathroom and has access to a second bathroom, the agency\ndetermined this is no longer a safety issue. However, they will continue working with\nthe relative to obtain FIG funds.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue\non a regular license.\n_ ______________May 9, 2022____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 11, 2022\n________________________________________\n9",
