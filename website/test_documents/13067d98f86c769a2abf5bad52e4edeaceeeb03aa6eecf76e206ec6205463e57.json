    "Two of three adoption home studies were not completed within 90 days as required.\nFOM 722-06B Family Team Meeting\nFTMs must occur within the required time frames as\noutlined in the following tables:\nUpdated Case Plan (USP) - within 30 calendar days\nbefore the case plan due date.\nTwo of twenty-three service plans did not have FTMs completed within 30 days\nbefore due date as required.\nRepeat violation: 12/6/22 RENEWAL, CAP approved 12/20/22\nFOM 801 Medical Passport\nAll medical information within the medical passport must\nbe current and updated at least quarterly to reflect the\nchild's current and complete health information.\nOne of six foster care files did not have quarterly updated medical passports as\nrequired.\nIV.

The case\nfile must document attempts to do this. Ongoing attempts should be made\nand documented to complete these actions and obtain a signature from\nthe parents on the treatment plan.\n• Parenting time must occur as outlined in service plan. There must be\ndocumentation in the case record of each parenting time or\nattempted/cancelled parenting time if the parent is not participating.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require or request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\n3",
    "The agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. A\nCAP, approved 12/20/22, was the result of the 12/6/22 renewal evaluation. In the\n2022 review, the agency had five violations regarding borrowed beds, medical\npassports, family team meetings, case contacts, and treatment plan signatures.\nDuring the current review, the agency had five violations, one of which was a\nrepeat regarding family team meetings. The agency reported successful\nimplementation of the 2022 CAP, which is evident as most of those areas have\nimproved. A new CAP will be developed to address the current and repeat\nviolation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment (CAA) was reviewed and discussed. The CAA\nreported meeting with staff and discussing the 2022 corrective action plan on a\nregular basis, in addition to completing file reviews to monitor improvement and\nneeds in areas that were previously non-compliant. The CAA reported the team\nreviewed the prior CAP and made adjustments as needed, based on their internal\ncompliance review. The CAA indicated overall improvement in all areas during the\npast year. The CAA also noted the agency had some challenges regarding staffing\nduring the past year. A change in directors at the end of the previous review\nperiod resulted in significant staff turnover. Due to staff shortage, the agency was\nunable to accept many cases. In July 2023 the prior director returned to the\nagency and has been working diligently to stabilize new staff and increase the\nnumber of cases served by the agency. Hiring new staff continues to be a\nchallenge due to limited qualified applicants. However, the director is committed to\nfinding quality staff.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. Both staff report they enjoy their job and feel\nthey have excellent supervisors. Staff report feeling close with coworkers and\nreceiving support and training as needed. Neither staff had concerns or\nsuggestions for improvement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the previous review.\nThe office has secure storage for confidential information. The building has\nadequate space for staff and clients.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: The upstairs bedroom had a lock on the door and several items\nwere blocking the door. The room was not observed or made accessible to the\nanalyst. A space heater was located in another bedroom.\n4",
    "Resolution: The doorway was cleared. The locked door was one of two doors\ninto the bedroom. The locked door is not used as it a “dead end hallway”. The\nspace heater was removed from the other bedroom and training was provided to\nthe foster parent.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n____________January 31, 2024____________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 1, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
