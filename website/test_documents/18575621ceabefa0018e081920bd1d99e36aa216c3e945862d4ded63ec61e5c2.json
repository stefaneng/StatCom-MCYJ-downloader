Supervisor reported she received information from\nStaff 1 of Youth A disclosing she had sexual intercourse with\nanother peer in the bathroom of the on-ground school. Supervisor\nreported she talked with Youth A about the situation and Youth A\ncontinued to switch the dates of this occurrence. First Youth A\nreported this happened back in December, then it went from six\nweeks ago to about three weeks ago. She reported Youth A\ncontinued to change the name of the youth this was with as well.\nSupervisor reported Youth A does not have any safety plan at this\ntime and has not had any concerns of sexualized behaviors.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on May 17, 2023. Staff 1\nreported the other day, Youth A asked her to take her to get a\npregnancy test. She reported she asked Youth A why she would\nneed that, and she reported that she believes she may be\npregnant from having sex. Staff 1 reported Youth A disclosed the\nfirst time she had sex was back in December and then recently\nbut did not have a specific date. Staff 1 reported Youth A at first\nwould not disclose who the youth was she had sex with but\neventually reported it was with Youth B in the bathroom at the\nonsite school. Staff 1 reported Youth A has reported having a\ncrush on Youth B and has been known to exaggerate her stories.\nShe reported the unit also just had a sex education course with\nthe facility nursing staff which could have led her to believe she\nwas pregnant. Staff 1 reported she noted these concerns because\nthe facility has had issues with the school bathroom before not\nbeing supervised. She reported the staff that works in the onsite\nschool are supposed to monitor when a youth goes to the\nbathroom. Staff 1 reported she does not work in the school, so\nshe does not have first-hand knowledge of the protocol or what\nsupervision looks like.\n2",
    "Youth A’s Foster Care Worker was interviewed via phone on\nMay 17, 2023. Youth A’s Foster Care Worker reported Youth A\nhas never disclosed any sexual intercourse happening at the\nfacility and does not have a history of sexualized behaviors. She\nreported she just met with Youth A at the facility to check in about\nthese allegations and Youth A was not being consistent with her\nstories. Youth A’s Foster Care Worker stated Youth A stated that\nat first, this happened back in December when she was not even\nplaced at the facility until March. She reported Youth A would not\ndisclose who the other youth was. Youth A reported to Youth A’s\nFoster Care Worker that to use the bathroom at school, staff need\nto unlock the door and would not disclose how the other youth got\ninto the bathroom. Youth A’s Foster Care Worker reported she\nhas no concerns with the facility and their supervision level. She\nreported Youth A likes to exaggerate stories at times.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on May 17,\n2023. Youth A reported she has been living at the facility since\nMarch 2023 and things have been going well. She reported no\nconcerns about the staff's ability to perform their jobs or level of\nsupervision. Youth A reported due to the facility being a secure\nsetting, staff need to unlock her bedroom door and bathroom door,\nincluding the classroom bathroom, in order for her to enter. When\nasked about the reported allegations, Youth A reported she did\nnot want to talk about it at first. After some time, she reported she\nhad sex with another peer in the on-campus school bathroom\nabout three weeks ago. Youth A reported she did not want to say\nwho the youth was and could not confirm the date or who was\nworking when this occurred. When asked how she got into the\nbathroom with the other youth, she reported she was going into\nthe bathroom, and he was coming out of the same bathroom and\nthere was no staff or other youth around. This consultant asked\nYouth A what the process is when you need to use the bathroom\nwithin the school, and she reported the youth has to raise their\nhand first and then sign out to use the bathroom. Youth A\nexplained the staff walk with the youth to the bathroom and unlock\nthe door. The consultant asked Youth A if the staff let her into the\nbathroom the day she had sex with the other youth and she\nreported no she was coming out of the bathroom when the other\nyouth was coming out. The consultant asked her to confirm what\nthe true story was if she was walking in or out of the bathroom\nwhen the other youth was in there to have sex. She then reported\nshe believes staff were distracted during the time it occurred\nbecause staff is good at supervising, but they were sneaky with\nthe situation. Youth A reported she does not remember the whole\nsituation and she told Staff 1 that it just occurred because she was\n3",
    "concerned she was pregnant. She reported she was happy that\nshe was not pregnant and noted that she just learned about\ngetting pregnant through the sex education presented by nursing\nlast week. Youth A continued to report she did not want to\ndisclose who the youth was and reported she would not talk with a\ndetective if they came to the facility.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on May 17,\n2023. Youth B reported that the staff do a good job of supervising\nthe youth at the facility. He reported he attends school on campus\nand the classroom is set up so the youth cannot be next to\nanother peer. Youth B reported staff is always listening to the\nyouth's conversations and the youth cannot get away with\nanything. He reported if a youth needs to use the bathroom during\nschool, the youth has to raise their hand and ask staff. Youth B\nreported once the youth is given permission to get up they have to\nsign out and staff will escort them to the bathroom. He stated staff\nhas to unlock the door and check the bathroom before a youth can\ngo in. Youth B reported he has never heard of anyone having sex\nin that bathroom. He reported he does not know how that would\nhappen since staff have to unlock the door for you and staff do not\nlet youth be alone in the hallway when there is another youth out\nthere. He stated, “never have I tried or never will I have sex in that\nbathroom.”\nEducation Coordinator, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 were\nseparately interviewed face to face at the facility on May 17,\n2023. Education Coordinator, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 all\nreported there is a procedure in place for when a youth needs to\nuse the restroom when within the classroom. Education\nCoordinator supervises the staff that works within the classroom\nand reported there have been no reported sexual behavior\nconcerns within the classroom with Youth A or any other youth.\nStaff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 work in the specific classroom that\nYouth A is placed in. They reported Youth A has not disclosed any\ninformation about having sex with another youth in the bathroom\nand does not know how that would be possible as the staff has to\nunlock the bathroom and check the bathroom. Staff reported when\na youth needs to use a bathroom the youth is to raise their hand,\nthen sign out, and then staff escorts the youth to the bathroom,\nthen staff will unlock the door and check that there is no one in\nthere. Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 reported the rule is no youth to\nbe left unattended in the hallway and if there is a youth having\nbehavioral concerns, there is extra staff that get called to help with\nthe situation so there is never a time of no supervision. Staff 2,\nStaff 3, and Staff 4 stated Youth A is not on any safety plan but\n4",
    "since the concern of these allegations, they are making sure she\nis fully being escorted everywhere. The staff all reported no\nconcerns about other staff’s ability to supervise the youth.\nYouth C and Youth D were separately interviewed face to face\nat the facility on May 17, 2023. Youth C and Youth D reported\nthey are both in the same classroom as Youth A. They both\nreported when a youth needs to use the restroom at the school,\nthey have to raise their hand and staff will give them the go-ahead\nto sign out. Staff then escort the youth to the bathroom, unlock the\nbathroom and check the bathroom before the youth can use it. No\ntwo youth can be in the hallway alone and have to wait for the go-\nahead to use the bathroom one at a time. Youth C and Youth D\nreported they have never heard of youth having sex in the\nbathroom at the school. They both reported no concerns about\nstaff supervision.\nDetective was interviewed via phone on May 17,\n2023. Detective reported she is closing out her case since Youth\nA is not willing to talk to her and there is no confirmation of who\nthe other youth was.\nTour Observation:\nA tour of the facility occurred on May 17, 2023. Consultant was\nable to view the area where Youth A attends school and where the\nbathroom is located. The classroom hallway where the classroom\nand bathroom area is located behind a locked door. Once the staff\nis to open the locked door the youth bathroom is to the right and\nthe door was locked. On the right side is the spare classroom\ncalled the “RCT” room where you can take a break and staff is\npresent. The main classroom is diagonally across from the locked\nbathroom. In the classroom, there were youth at their desk that\nwere evenly spaced out and three staff members sitting in\ndifferent spots of the classroom. This consultant was able to see\nthe bathroom sign-out sheet that the youth use as well.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n- Youth A’s File- Youth A was placed at the facility at the\nbeginning of March 2023. There were no active safety plans\nresulting in increased supervision of Youth A prior to the report of\nthe allegations. On May 17, 2023, a safety plan was created with\nYouth A, Youth A’s Foster Care Worker, and the facility’s\ntherapist, noting Youth A will not be left alone with male peers at\nany time, she will be escorted to her room until completion of\nsexual education course, and Youth A will participate in a sexual\neducation course. Youth A has developmental/intellectual needs\n5",
    "as she has an FSIQ of 62, which is within the very low range of\noverall cognitive ability.\n- Facility Procedure for School Bathroom Use- This procedure\ndocuments the steps that need to occur when a youth at the\nonsite school needs to use the restroom. The procedure notes:\n“Client will raise their hand in the classroom to ask to use the\nbathroom; Staff will ensure there is no another client in the\nrestroom and will then approve for the client to use the bathroom;\nClient will then sign out to use the bathroom on the appropriate\nsign-out sheet in the classroom; staff will then walk with the client\nto the bathroom; staff will knock on the bathroom door, then\nunlock the bathroom; Staff checks the bathroom (no other client is\nin the bathroom, checking trash cans, checking surrounding areas\nfor notes, vapes writing on walls, or other contraband); If another\nclient is in the hallway while the client is in the bathroom, staff will\ncontinue to provide supervision in the hallway to ensure that two\nclients are never alone together.”\n-Bathroom sign-out sheet- The sign out sheet that is used for\nthe classroom has the date, time, student signature, staff checking\noff bathroom was okay before and after youth’s usage, and the\nstaff’s initials. The bathroom log sheets were reviewed from the\ndate of 04/27/2023 to 05/17/2023. From reviewing the log there is\nat least five minutes between each sign out time of the youth that\nneeded to use the restroom. Within the review on 05/01/2023,\nYouth A signed out to use the restroom about five minutes after\nher return, Youth B signed out by staff to use the restroom and\nthen another youth was signed out to use the restroom after.\nFrom reviewing the documentation, it appears to be within in\ncompliance of the agency policy.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with staff following the\nsupervision procedure for the school bathroom. The staff and\nyouth both reported a youth needs to ask staff first to use the\nrestroom and staff have to unlock the bathroom door and check\nthe bathroom prior to a youth entering the bathroom. Youth A\nwould not disclose full details of what occurred, and her reporting\nwas inconsistent.\nTechnical assistance\nTechnical assistance was provided to the facility about their\nbathroom sign-out sheet to potentially add a time slot for when the\nyouth return from the restroom where either the youth or staff\ncompletes that portion.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be continued.\nMay 23, 2023\n____________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 31, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
