    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 gave Youth A vape to smoke. It is unsure if marihuana.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI spoke to Administrator 1 on 1/13/25 at the facility. Administrator\n1 reported an incident report was written for Youth A due to him\nhaving a vape on the alleged date. Youth A had lost his home visit\ndue to this behavior. Follow up emails and a phone conversation\non 1/31/25 confirms that home passes are contingent on the\nbehaviors of the youth in the program. Youth A was still able to\ntalk to his family and is given ongoing opportunities to visit family.\nI spoke to Youth A on 1/13/25 at the facility. Youth A reported on\nthe date of the incident, 12/16/24, he was asked to help take trash\nto the administration building with Staff 1. Youth reported he put\nhis coat on and when he bent down to grab his shoes, a vape\nbreeze fell out of his inside pocket. Youth A reported Staff 1 asked\nhim for the vape and proceeded to tell him that he would not\nreport this to anyone. Youth A gave him the vape and they then\nwent outside to the administration building. On the way there, both\nStaff 1 and Youth A smoked the vape together. Once they went\ninto the building, they took the trash out and smoked the vape in\nthe back of the administration building as well. Youth A reported\nthey saw Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 did not tell him about the vape.\nStaff 1 and Youth A then went back to their unit. Youth A reported\nStaff 1 left the unit and when he came back, he came into his\nroom and said, “Sorry [Youth A], I had to tell Supervisor 1 about\nthe vape. I didn’t want to lose my job.” Youth A reported he told\nStaff 1 to get out of his room. Youth A reported he lost his home\nvisit and was upset. Youth A reported he told Staff 2 what\nhappened, and Staff 3 let him call his family to tell them he\n2",
    "wouldn’t be coming home. Youth A reported he received the vape\npen from a part-time staff a couple days before the incident. Youth\nA reported it was nicotine. Youth A would not provide any other\ninformation.\nI spoke to Youth B and Youth C separately at the facility on\n1/13/25. Both youths reported they have never seen staff give any\nyouth a vape pen and have never heard of a staff smoking a vape\npen with youth in the unit. Both youths reported all staff in the unit\ntreat the youth the same.\nI spoke to Staff 2 via telephone on 1/16/25. Staff 2 confirmed he\nwas working on the night of the allegations with Staff 1. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 and Youth A went to take the trash out. Later he\nwas told by Youth A that he was caught with a vape and Staff 1\ntook it and gave it to Supervisor 1. He reported Youth A stated\nStaff 1 smoked the vape with him. Staff 2 reported he later asked\nStaff 1 about the incident and Staff 1 reported there was no truth\nin that accusation. Staff 1 admitted to Staff 2 that he told Youth A\nhe wouldn’t report it, but then realized he had to. Staff 2 reported\nhe did not know where Youth A received the vape.\nI spoke to Supervisor 1 on 1/16/25 via telephone. Supervisor 1\nconfirmed he was working on the date of the alleged incident.\nSupervisor 1 reported Staff 1 came to his office after he had taken\nthe trash out with Youth A and proceeded to tell him that he found\na vape on Youth A, but did tell Youth A that he would not report it.\nSupervisor 1 reported Staff 1 was to go back to the unit and let\nYouth A know that he would receive an incident report for the\ncontraband. Supervisor 1 reported he knew that Staff 1 had\nfollowed through because he received a phone call to receive\npermission for Youth A to call his family. Supervisor 1 reported he\ndid not see Youth A and Staff 1 walking from the unit to the\nadministration building or to the trash dumpster.\nI spoke to Staff 3 on 1/21/25 via telephone. Staff 3 reported she\ndid not see or hear about what happened until Youth A wanted to\ncall his family. Staff 3 reported she got permission for Youth A to\ncall his family and asked Staff 1 what had happened. Staff 3\nreported Staff 1 told her that he had found a vape and told Youth\nA that if he would give him the vape he would not give him a write\nup, but he did anyways. Staff 3 reported a couple days later she\ntalked to Youth A and Youth A brought up the incident but did not\nstate that Staff 1 was smoking the vape with him, only that he was\nupset that Staff 1 lied to him when he said he wouldn’t write him\nup. Staff 3 reported she did not know where Youth A got the vape.\n3",
    "I spoke to Staff 1 on 1/21/25 via telephone. Staff 1 reported he\ncompleted trash duty with Youth A. While Youth A was getting his\nshoes on, a vape pen fell out of his pocket. Staff 1 asked Youth A\nto give him the vape and he refused. Staff 1 then reported he told\nYouth A he wouldn’t give him a write up for it if he gave it to him.\nYouth A then gave him the vape pen. Staff 1 reported they\ncompleted trash and then afterwards, Staff 1 realized that he had\nmade a mistake in telling Youth A he couldn’t write him up. Staff 1\nwent to the administration building and talked to Supervisor 1. He\nthen provided Youth A with a write up. Staff 1 reported he did not\nsmoke the vape with Youth A and did not provide Youth A with a\nvape. Staff 1 reported he had a “conflict resolution” meeting with\nYouth A after the incident to restore their relationship. Staff 1\nreported he did apologize for lying to Youth A in that meeting.\nDocuments:\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. All clearances and\ntraining were up to date. Staff 1 did not have discipline in\nhis file.\n• I reviewed the incident report dated 12/19/24. The incident\nreport is in agreement with Staff 1’s interview. The vape is\ndescribed as a nicotine breeze.\n• I reviewed the staff schedule for the week of 12/19/24; no\npart time staff was scheduled to work in the unit with Youth\nA.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as during interviews with staff\nand youth, only Youth A reported Staff 1 smoked a vape with him.\nStaff 1 denied doing so, but admitted he was not truthful with\nYouth A about writing an incident report in which, Staff 2, Staff 3\nand Supervisor 1 confirmed. Youth A only reported he received\nthe vape from a parttime staff the week prior with no further\ninformation, but no parttime staff worked.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n2/3/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
