    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription (1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\ncontact with children or parents to be a person who has the\nability, experience, education, and training to perform the\nduties assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A foster care worker interfered with a DCWL and MDHHS\ninvestigation.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 8/18/25 DCWL Area Manager reported that during a joint\ninvestigation with DCWL and MDHHS, Foster Care Worker\ninappropriately shared investigation information. Foster Care\nWorker reportedly contacted the Residential Director for the facility\nunder investigation (2025SIC0000938) and requested information\nregarding the allegation. Foster Care Worker then called the\nalleged perpetrator (Residential Staff) and discussed the\nallegations. Residential Staff transferred the call back to\nResidential Director, who then ended the questioning. In addition,\nFoster Care Worker was aware of when DCWL and MDHHS\nwould be on site to interview the youth. Foster Care Worker\narrived on site and spoke to the youth about the allegations, prior\nto DCWL and MDHHS. These contacts by Foster Care Worker\ninterfered with the DCWL and MDHHS ability to complete an\nunannounced visit or interviews.\nOn 8/18/25 DCWL Consultant provided information via email,\nregarding the allegation. DCWL Consultant provided a breakdown\nof the communication that occurred on 8/13/25. DCWL Consultant\nreceived the allegation at 1:14pm. MDHHS was emailed at\n1:20pm to coordinate. At 1:22pm MDHHS emailed DCWL\nConsultant and Foster Care Worker about coordinating to go to\nthe facility. At 1:22pm MDHHS Worker called DCWL and reported\nthat Foster Care Worker wanted to attend the interview with the\nyouth on 8/14/25. DCWL Worker stated that was not typical, but\nshe could be there with the understanding she would not be\ninvolved in other interviews. The plan was for MDHHS and DCWL\nConsultant to arrive at the facility at 11:00am on 8/14/25, with\nFoster Care Worker arriving at 11:30am. Consultant spoke with\nResidential Director at 1:44pm. Residential Director informed\nConsultant that Foster Care Worker had contacted him repeatedly\n2",
    "about the allegation. On 8/14/25 MDHHS and DCWL Consultant\narrived at the facility at 11:00am to speak with Residential Director\nand planned to interview some staff prior to Foster Care Worker\narriving at 11:30am to speak with the youth. Before 11:30am\nMDHHS Worker got a call from Foster Care Worker, asking if they\nwere coming to the unit as she was already with the youth. When\nDCWL Consultant arrived in the conference room at 11:30am\nFoster Care Worker was already talking with the youth. MDHHS\nbegan the interview process by explaining why they were there.\nThe child reported he already knew why. Foster Care Worker\nstated she read the allegations to him and explained the interview.\nMDHHS asked if Foster Care Worker read the allegations word for\nword from the intake. Foster Care Worker answered, “Yes, was I\nnot supposed to do that”. After the interview DCWL Consultant\nreported she and MDHHS Worker spoke with Foster Care Worker\nabout the importance of confidentiality and allowing the two\nagencies to complete their investigation without interference.\nFoster Care Worker was receptive to the feedback. Foster Care\nWorker stated she had not worked with MDHHS before and was\nunaware of how things worked. When DCWL Consultant asked\nwhy Foster Care Worker called the alleged perpetrator about the\ninvestigation, Foster Care Worker stated she did not know\nResidential Staff was the alleged perpetrator, as they went by a\ndifferent name than what was listed in the intake.\nOn 8/21/25 Supervisor was contacted by email, but a return\nmessage indicated they were out of the office until 8/26/25.\nSupervisor was contacted again on 8/29/25. An interview via video\ncall occurred on 9/3/25. Supervisor reported she was part of the\nemail notification about the allegation regarding the residential\nfacility. Supervisor notified Foster Care Worker about the\nallegation and let her know to contact MDHHS Worker to\ncoordinate. Supervisor stated she was in a meeting when the\nallegation came in, so she was unable to talk with Foster Care\nWorker as she made contacts. Supervisor became aware of\nFoster Care Worker’s contacts with Residential Director and\nResidential Staff after the fact. Supervisor stated she thought\nFoster Care Worker was familiar with working with MDHHS and\nDCWL due to her experience with the agency’s Independent\nLiving home. Supervisor reported she did not have any prior\nconcerns about Foster Care Worker. All staff complete training\nabout investigations and working with MDHHS when they\ncomplete Child Welfare Training Institute training (CWTI) and also\nthrough training at the agency. Supervisor stated she believed a\nlesson was learned in this situation and Foster Care Worker will\ntake the correct steps in the future.\n3",
    "On 8/21/25 Foster Care Worker (FCW) was contacted by email\nregarding the investigation. An interview was completed via video\ncall on 8/22/25. FCW reported she had been in her position with\nthe agency since 2021. Regarding the alleged incident, FCW\nstated she received the MDHHS allegation via email from\nSupervisor on 8/13/25. FCW was preparing to go on vacation and\nwanted to make some contacts to ensure the youth was ok, prior\nto leaving. FCW read the allegations and called the residential\nfacility to check on the youth and confirm he was physically safe.\nFCW spoke with Residential Staff, not realizing at the time they\nwere the alleged perpetrator. Residential Staff reported the youth\nwas fine and did not need medical attention. FCW denied\ndiscussing the allegations with Residential Staff. FCW reported\nshe spoke with Residential Director, who confirmed the youth was\nnot injured and did not need medical attention. FCW stated\nResidential Director was not aware of the allegations at the time\nshe called. FCW stated she did not discuss the allegations by\nphone. However, she had initially emailed Residential Director and\nindicated she was reaching out because of the allegations.\nApproximately an hour after FCW received the allegations,\nMDHHS emailed FCW for information regarding the youth. FCW\nprovided responses to the questions. On 8/14/25 FCW went to the\nfacility to see the youth. FCW reported she scheduled the meeting\nwith MDHHS and DCWL Consultant. FCW confirmed she met with\nthe youth prior to MDHHS or DCWL Consultant arriving. FCW\nasked the youth if he knew why they were talking with him. The\nyouth was unaware. FCW stated she did tell the youth the\nallegations, as she was unaware she was not supposed to. FCW\nstated the youth was confused about why FCW was there, so she\nfelt the need to explain. FCW explained the allegation and asked\nthe youth a few questions about if Residential Staff was in his\nroom or hurt him. The youth provided some details about the\nincident. MDHHS and DCWL Consultant then interviewed the\nyouth without FCW participating.\nFCW stated she had called in “a lot” of concerns to MDHHS in the\npast and never had contact with a worker. FCW stated she was\ntruly unaware that she should not speak with anyone prior to the\ninvestigation. FCW reported she has never completed training\nregarding investigations or contact with MDHHS and DCWL. FCW\nstated this experience has taught her about investigation\nprocedures and how to proceed in the future.\nEmail contact occurred with Residential Director on 8/20/25 and\n8/22/25. In an email dated 8/22/25, Residential Director reported\n4",
    "that FCW contacted him by phone at 12:56pm on 8/13/25 and left\na message to contact her urgently. FCW then emailed at 1:10pm\nand stated she had been notified of an incident involving MDHHS\ndue to staff hurting the youth. FCW requested additional\ninformation and wanted to verify the youth’s wellbeing. FCW also\nasked who made the report to MDHHS. FCW emailed again at\n1:30pm and 1:50pm, asking for a phone call. During that time,\nResidential Director spoke with DCWL Consultant and notified her\nthat FCW had contacted him regarding the allegation. FCW also\ncalled the unit and spoke with the alleged perpetrator, Residential\nStaff. The call was then transferred to Residential Director, where\nhe informed FCW that he already spoke with DCWL Consultant.\nResidential Director informed FCW that DCWL or MDHHS would\nbe reaching out to her. FCW stated that she would be “coming out\nto meet” MDHHS. Residential Director stated that his interaction\nwith FCW was above what is typically expected in similar\ninvestigations. FCW had called and emailed multiple times and\nspoke directly with Residential Staff, which was unusual.\nResidential Director felt the investigation was not able to be\nconducted with the typical professionalism and confidentiality that\nwould normally occur.\nOn 9/15/25 MDHHS Worker was interviewed via video call.\nMDHHS Worker reported that after receiving the allegations, she\nmade notifications as required. She was then informed that FCW\nhad contacted Residential Director several times and reached out\nto Residential Staff. However, it appeared the contact with\nResidential Staff was not intentional, as FCW knew that person by\na name other than what was listed as the alleged perpetrator.\nMDHHS Worker did not believe the allegations were shared with\nResidential Staff by FCW. MDHHS Worker reported arriving at the\nfacility the following day, with DCWL Consultant, to find that FCW\nhad already read the allegations to the youth and discussed the\nsituation with him. MDHHS Worker was surprised as this goes\nagainst MDHHS protocol for interviewing youth. MDHHS Worker\nstated she never had agency staff do this before. After completing\nthe interview with the youth, MDHHS Worker and DCWL\nConsultant spoke with FCW and explained how the interview\nprocess should occur. They made it clear that MDHHS and DCWL\ntake the lead on investigations, and FCW cannot share allegations\nor conduct interviews without coordinating with MDHHS and\nDCWL. FCW was receptive to this feedback.\nDocuments reviewed\n• Emails provided by DCWL Consultant, Residential Director,\nand Foster Care Worker were reviewed. The emails were\n5",
    "consistent with the information provided during interviews\nregarding FCW contacting staff and the youth.\n• DCWL Special Investigation 2025SIC0000938 was still in\nprogress. A review of case contacts by DCWL Consultant\nwas completed. The Special Investigation contacts were\nconsistent with the information provided in interviews with\nMDHHS, Residential Director, and Foster Care Worker.\n• Human Resources file for Foster Care Worker held the\nfollowing relevant information:\no Hired 8/2/2021\no Training: BCS New Hire 8/18/21, Foster Care New\nHire 9/16/21, CWTI training 10/1/2021. Aside from\nwhat is covered in CWTI and new hire training, there\ndid not appear to be any training regarding working\nwith MDHHS for investigations.\no Performance Coaching Form dated 11/9/22. FCW\nwas addressed regarding improper attire in court, at\nthe office, and in the Independent Living home. In\naddition, FCW was addressed regarding their\ncommunication/verbiage. Incidents quoted involved\nFCW being defensive and accusatory with staff,\nfrequently mispronouncing one youth’s name, using\nimproper cultural terms for refugee clients, and\nescalating a youth with improper language. Lastly,\nFCW was addressed regarding the complaints the\nagency received about the state of FCW’s office\nspace. Expectations were outlined and training\nregarding “Professional in the Workplace” occurred.\no Performance Coaching Form dated 4/25/23. FCW\nreceived a formal verbal morning after being\nobserved hugging and kissing youth on the head.\nFCW reported it was “mom instinct” when the two\nyouth were going through something difficult. The\nagency reviewed expectations with FCW and\ncompleted training regarding “Therapeutic\nBoundaries” and “Professionalism In the Workplace”.\no Performance Coaching Form dated 7/18/25. FCW\nreceived the counseling due to FCW failing to\nconsistently meet essential functions of a\ncaseworker, despite support and coaching with\nregular supervisory meetings. The agency reviewed\nexpectations with FCW and documented that\nadditional disciplinary action would occur if\nexpectations were not met.\nAnalysis A violation was found. Based on information obtained through\ninterviews and documentation, it was determined Foster Care\n6",
    "Worker made contact with facility staff and youth and informed\nthem of the allegations. Foster Care Worker reported she was\nunaware that she was supposed to wait for MDHHS and DCWL\nbefore discussing the investigation or conducting interviews.\nBased on Foster Care Worker’s human resources file, it appears\nthe worker has not received investigation training aside from what\nwas covered in their initial training in 2021.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A correcitve action plan is required.\n_ ______________September 16, 2025_____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 17, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
