Youth A reported the\nmedication was Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen and “taking 10-12\npills”. Youth A reported not swallowing the pills but did place the\npills in Youth A’s mouth. Youth A also reported Staff 1 held Youth\nA’s jaw not allowing Youth A to swallow the pills, so Youth A spit\nthe pills into Staff 1’s hand. Youth A reported sitting at the kitchen\ntable with Staff 1 when Youth A noticed Staff 1’s pills sitting on the\ntable and Youth A was feeling as if she didn’t want to live any\nlonger therefore, Youth A grabbed the pills and put them in her\nmouth. Youth A reported Staff 1 had a purse and had removed the\npills from the purse to take a pill. Youth A reported Staff 2 was in\nthe room doing dishes at the time and had Staff 2’s back turned to\nYouth A and Staff 1 who were sitting at the table. Youth A\nreported being on “one-to-one” supervision because of suicidal\nthinking over the past couple of days and Staff 1 was the staff with\nthe “one-to-one” supervision responsibility.

    "Administrator 1, Administrator 2, and Administrator 3 were\ninterviewed face-to-face at the facility on 2/12/2025 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Administrator 1 reported\ncalling Central Intake to get approval to send Youth A into\ntreatment at the hospital. She also reported being asked why\nYouth A needed this increase in treatment and responding that\nYouth A is displaying suicidal ideation and Youth A’s doctor\nsuggested the increase. Administrator 1 reported not saying\nanything about Youth A’s attempt to take pills. They reported\nhaving the incident on video and will provide the recording. They\nalso reported Staff 2 was in the kitchen when the incident took\nplace and Staff 1 and Staff 2 both contacted Administrator 1 “right\naway” following the incident. They reported reviewing the video\nrecording and observed Youth A take the pills and place them in\nYouth A’s mouth for about “30 seconds” before spitting the pills\nout of Youth A’s mouth. They also reported Youth A only put\nTylenol in Youth A’s mouth and then only a “couple” of pills. They\nreported Youth A started to become dysregulated over issues with\nYouth A’s mother from the past on Friday which caused the “one-\non-one” supervision to begin. They also reported about Youth A’s\nself-harming event on Saturday and Youth A’s release from the\nhospital on Sunday. Youth A has been on this increased level of\nsupervision since then. They reported the policy for staff’s\npersonal belongings is that these items must be left in the locked\noffice and not brought out of the locked office. Staff are not to\nhave personal items on them when working. They also reported if\nStaff 1 needed something from her purse/bag then Staff 1 should\nhave asked for relief from Staff 2, went into the office to obtain\nwhat she needed and then left the personal items in the purse/bag\nin the locked office. They reported going over this policy with Staff\n1 yesterday and providing disciplinary action for this breaking of\npolicy. Administrator 1 reported Youth A kept asking for Ibuprofen\nfor emotional pain and saying Youth A wanted to die and not be in\nthe program anymore. Administrator 1 reported because of these\nactions by Youth A, Administrator 1 made the decision to take\nYouth A to the hospital for an evaluation. Administrator 1 reported\nYouth A informed Administrator 1 that the emotional pain was\nbecause of Youth A’s trauma narrative which involved Youth A’s\nmother not reaching out to Youth A.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n2/12/2025 in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1\nreported being the “one-to-one” staff for Youth A the day of the\nincident and they were sitting at the kitchen table eating breakfast.\nStaff 1 also reported having her purse at the table because she\n3",
    "was trying to organize the purse and find her journal. She reported\nhaving Tylenol and ibuprofen in a zip lock bag and sat it on the\ntable. Staff 1 reported Youth A “snatched” the bag and opened the\nbottle of Tylenol taking about 4 pills and placing them in Youth A’s\nmouth. Staff 1 reported not wanting Youth A to swallow the pills,\nso Staff 1 placed her hand under Youth A’s chin. This move\ncaused Youth A to spit the pills out into Staff 1’s hand. Staff 1\nreported switching out with Staff 2 and putting her purse in the\nlocked office. Staff 1 reported placing her purse in the office when\nfirst coming to work but then taking the purse out to look for the\njournal. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 turned around after hearing Staff 1\nsay something about the pills and assisting Staff 1. Staff 1\nreported receiving a write-up for the violation of the policy about\npersonal items and being told she needs more training.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 2/13/2025 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. She reported being the\nassigned staff for Youth A’s one-to-one supervision the day of the\nincident. She also reported Staff 1 switched with Staff 2 so Staff 2\ncould finish the dishes. Staff 2 reported hearing Staff 1 tell Youth\nA to put something down and when turning around to see, Staff 2\nobserved Staff 1 getting a bottle of pills from Youth A and Youth A\ngrabbing a second bottle of pills. She reported Youth A opened\nthe bottle and put some pills in Youth A’s mouth. She reported\nStaff 1 squeezed Youth A’s mouth causing Youth A to spit the pills\nout. Staff 2 reported knowing that all staff are to leave their\npersonal items in the locked office except for their phones and\nkeys. Staff 2 reported observing Staff 1’s purse but saying nothing\nabout it. Staff 2 reported Youth A was on suicidal watch (one-to-\none) which means a staff is to always be with Youth A. She\nreported this began over the weekend when Youth A became\ndysregulated and attempted self-harm after barricading Youth A in\nYouth A’s bedroom.\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 2/18/2025. She\nreported having no further information.\nWalk-through:\nA walk through was completed at the facility and the areas the\nincident took place in were inspected.

Staff 1 removes what appears to be pills from\nthe plastic bag and places them in her mouth before taking a drink\nfrom a water bottle. Staff 1 appears to place the plastic bag in\nfront of her on the table and sits down to the right of Youth A at\nthe table. Staff 2 walks into the room and goes to the countertop\nleft of the sink before moving to the sink and turning her back to\nYouth A and Staff 1 who remain sitting at the table. Staff 1 places\nthe bottles of medication back in the plastic bag and places the\nplastic bag on the table in front of her again. Staff 1 picks up her\npurse/bag and Youth A quickly grabbed the plastic bag of\nmedication. Staff 1 holds out her left hand in a gesture of wanting\nthe plastic bag back. Staff 2 turns around from the sink just after\nYouth A appears to open a bottle. Staff 1 appears to try and grab\nthe plastic bag from Youth A who turns away from Staff 1. Youth A\nhands a bottle to Staff 1, Youth A appears to place something in\nYouth A's mouth as Staff 2 runs towards Youth A.

Youth A spits something out of Youth A’s mouth as Staff 1\nremoves her hand before standing up with her purse/bag and\nwalking to the trash can, appearing to throw something out.
