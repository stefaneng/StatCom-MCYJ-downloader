Staff\nmember has been removed from the facility at this time.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant/Chief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face\nto face at the facility on 2/9/23 in conjunction with MDHHS\nWorker. CA reported Staff 1 had boundary issues with youth, so\nthey decided to put her through retraining. A performance\nimprovement plan was written for Staff 1, but it was not fully\nexecuted because Staff 1 quit prior to all steps being\nimplemented. CA stated they frequently instruct staff to be\nfriendly, but not a friend. However, CA stated Staff 1 appeared like\nshe was more of a friend to the youth. Staff 1 told supervisors and\nadministrators she was a “mama bear” and a “toucher” and must\nlearn not to be. CA reported Staff 1 admitted she struggled with\nboundaries but wanted to make sure she was looking out for the\nyouth. CA reported Staff 1 found out the youth were using a\ncomputer program called “My Journal” to write messages back\nand forth to each other. When administrators reviewed the\nmessages that youth were writing, they found a message written\nby one youth stating Staff 1 was offering inappropriate sexual\nfavors for reduced sentences, specifically to Youth A and Youth B.\nCA reported Staff 1 showed favoritism towards some youth. CA\nreported Staff 1 quit on 2/6/23 due to the stress associated with\nthe situation.\nYouth A and Youth C were interviewed face to face at the jail\non 2/9/23 and Youth B was interviewed via phone on 2/16/23\nin conjunction with MDHHS Worker.

Staff 1 reported she doesn’t know why it\nwould ever be said she offered to get someone’s sentenced\nreduced in return for any kind of favor because she obviously has\nno control or authority to do so. She reported she felt she had to\nquit her job because these types of rumors could tarnish her\nreputation. She felt if she returned to work, the youth would “eat\nher alive” because they tend to attack any weakness they see,\nand this would have been considered a weakness. Staff 1\nadmitted she has boundary issues, but she just wants to look out\nfor the youth there and felt she had to build a rapport to be able to\ndo that. She reported she talked about her personal life\nsometimes and she talked to one youth about birth control one\ntime, and those situations are deemed inappropriate.

Staff\n2 stated Staff 1 would have conversations with the youth about\nthings going on in her personal life, talk about her grandchildren,\netc., which were not appropriate for their role in the facility. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 tended to share too much information and was\nlike that with every youth, but seemed to have more conversations\nwith Youth A and Youth B. Besides Staff 1 being too friendly, Staff\n2 did not hear or witness any interactions Staff 1 had with youth\nthat would be deemed inappropriate.\n3",

Administrator completed\nrandom and frequent video audits to determine if staff were being\ncompliant with pod management. Administrator noticed Staff 1\noften pushed professional boundaries with the youth, such as\ntelling them not to say something out loud and instructing them to\nwrite notes instead.
