DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The facility must create and follow a uniform process for employee records to\nensure all the information required by licensing rules is in the employee's file,\nespecially at the time of the facility's annual audit. The electronic files provided by\nHR were missing multiple documents. The HR file can come from the program\ndirectly or HR, but the file provided must include all required documents.\n2",
    "• If orientation checklists are provided as verification, they must be filled out\ncompletely with initials and dates of completion. The signature from the\nsupervisor at the bottom of the form is not sufficient.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request or require any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had one CAP as a result of their 2024 Renewal Audit and the CAP was\napproved on 7/25/24. It should be noted during this renewal audit, the facility had\ntwo different programs under the same license (TLC and Ridgeview), but TLC\nopened their program under a new license as of 5/7/25. The facility was found in\nviolation of the following rules, however, all violations found were on TLC staff and\nyouth files.\n- Rule 113(1)(e)\n- Rule 113(1)(i) was a repeat violation.\n- Rule 113(1)(j)\n- Rule 114(1) was a repeat violation.\n- Rule 128(3)\n- Rule 155(1) was a repeat violation.\n- Rule 156(1) was a repeat violation.\n- Rule 166(1)(b-e) was a repeat violation.\nThe facility had one CAP as a result of SIR#2024SIC0001373 dated 5/13/24 with\na CAP approval date of 6/17/24. The facility was found in violation of Rule\n159(1)(d) as it was found staff were not always completing their restraint refresher\ntrainings within 365 days of their previous training as required. The facility updated\ntheir restraint policy to reflect the requirement, offered immediate CPI trainings\nover the course of 1 week for staff who were overdue/nearing their due date,\nrequired new hires to complete an online version of CPI orientation within 30 days\nof hire, assigned CPI training to be completed within 90 days for new hires,\nrequired seasoned staff to complete CPI training within 300 days from the date of\ntheir last training, created a requirement for supervisors to review staff CPI training\ndates, and scheduled ongoing quarterly CPI trainings to ensure opportunities for\ncontinued compliance.\n3",
    "Financial Overview\nThe facility's 2025 financial budget and Bethany Christian Services' 2024 financial\naudit were reviewed. There were no concerns noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nThe MDHHS Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) compliance monitoring report\nwas completed on 12/15/22 and the facility was found in compliance with all\nstandards. The facility also received a certificate of completion for compliance\nmonitoring for December 2022-December 2023. The facility had a compliance visit\nin 2024, and they were found in compliance. Their next audit is scheduled for fall of\n2025.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted staff turnover had a significant impact on the need\nfor the CAP from the 2024 Renewal Audit. Leadership staff left in TLC which\nimpacted other staff having history, knowledge of programming, procedures, and\nwhy things are done in a certain manner/method. CA noted these same concerns\nwere not a part of the Ridgeview program, since TLC has now moved to a separate\nlicense, these issues will not be problematic moving forward. CA noted an\nadditional position was put in place to help with training and quality assurance,\nwhich has had a positive impact. CA noted the youth placed into the program are\ndemonstrating more chronic and complex mental health and behavioral needs, so\nprogram assessments and evaluations are being completed to identify specific\nareas to modify, including clinical programming (i.e. written work, methods of\nintervention, adding additional clinical programming, etc.), behavioral programming\n(i.e. adjusting behavioral system, program rules, day-to-day experiences, etc.), and\nstaff support (i.e. adding additional training and/or supports for staff). CA noted\nRidgeview Administration (residential director, clinical program director, and\nprogram manager) conduct a monthly meeting to discuss program needs and\nresponses to those needs. In addition, Sanctuary Core Team Members conduct a\nmonthly meeting to discuss implementation of Sanctuary Model of Care Principles.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported they have not had any restraints at the facility for over three years,\nwhich they're very proud of. Staff reported despite being short-staffed, everyone\n(including therapists and administrators) is pitching in to pick up the slack, which is\nproof of their teamwork. Staff reported communication is smooth and one of the\nlarge perks of working at the facility. Staff reported regular team meetings are held,\nwhich include great discussions amongst staff. Staff reported the program has\nwelcomed feedback more now than before, and the Sanctuary Program helps\nfacilitate that. Staff reported feeling valued and supported. Staff reported there\ncould always be more training for increased behaviors, different types of de-\nescalation, etc. especially being short-staffed. Staff reported relationships between\nstaff and youth are good, and there have been no concerns regarding those\ninteractions. Staff reported there have been a lot of great changes happening\nrecently regarding new staffing positions opening, great & strategic choices for\n4",
    "promotions, etc. which makes everyone excited for the future. Staff reported they\nfeel the facility is building in ways for youth specialists to advance and become\nmore involved, which is going to increase their retention.\nYouth reported things within the program and with school are going well. Youth\nreported staff are nice and treat them well. Youth reported they like achieving their\nlevels in the program and feel supported in making progress. Youth reported staff\nare quick to offer assistance when youth are struggling. Youth reported the only\ntime they don't feel safe in the program are when other youth act out, however, they\nnoted staff intervene quickly and efficiently. Youth reported the food is good and\nthey receive a sufficient amount of food. Youth reported other youth can be cruel\nabout joking about LGBTQ+, Autism, cancer, terrorism, racial issues, and any other\ncontroversial topics. Youth reported they feel staff need to set firmer and more\nconsistent boundaries regarding what topics are appropriate to talk about and what\nisn't because it can make youth feel unsafe, offended, etc. Youth reported they feel\nall youth need more knowledge on Autism as a few youth admitted to the program\nare on the Autism spectrum, so more information would be helpful in preventing\ndiscrimination and harassment.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA tour of the facility occurred during the inspection on 6/18/25. The facility was\nclean and in good condition. There were no safety concerns noted during the\ninspection.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nAugust 11, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 12, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
