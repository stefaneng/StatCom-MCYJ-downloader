Youth A's shoes were removed\nthe day prior after he went AWOL from the building.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nAWOL Policy and Procedures: The AWOL policy outlines the\nsteps to be taken when a youth is determined to be absent without\nleave (AWOL). Some of the steps include:\n• Residential staff are required to notify law enforcement\nimmediately once it is confirmed that a youth has gone\nAWOL.\n• When a youth returns from AWOL, the Supervisor or\nCoordinator on duty is responsible for placing the youth on\nAWOL status, which includes the following measures:\no The youth’s shoes are to be secured in the\nsupervisor's office.\no The youth is to wear pajamas while in the facility.\no The youth must remain within arm’s length of staff at\nall times from the point of return.\nTreatment Standards and Expectations Policy: All staff are\nresponsible for providing a nurturing, supportive, and treatment-\noriented environment for all residents.

Even though both the youth and staff\nconfirmed that removal of shoes is used as a consequence for\nAWOL behavior the facility policy and Chief Administrator indicate\nthe policy is in place to deter AWOL behavior.\nTechnical Assistance:\nWhile this intervention was intended as an AWOL deterrent tactic,\nthe removal of footwear may be considered a denial of an\nessential personal need, which is prohibited under Rule\n400.4158(1)(b)(iv). Footwear is an essential item and should not\nbe withheld as a form of punishment.\nAlthough no further concerns were identified regarding Youth A’s\nclothing and the agency was found to be in compliance, technical\nassistance was provided to clarify that all interventions must\ncomply with licensing standards and should never involve\nwithholding essential items necessary for safety, comfort, or well-\nbeing.\nIt was suggested that any strategies to deter AWOL be carefully\nevaluated and individualized to the youth’s needs. In this case,\nthis tactic was not effective for Youth A and should be\nreconsidered.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection Intervention standards and prohibitions\nDescription (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation During an interview conducted with Youth B on 5/14/2025, he\nreported that Staff 4 pulled on his arm.\n10",
