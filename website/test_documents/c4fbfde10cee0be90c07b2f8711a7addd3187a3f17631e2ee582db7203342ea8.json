    "II. METHODOLOGY\n01/20/2011 Enrollment\n02/28/2011 On Site Inspection – Full compliance\n03/17/2011 Inspection Completed-Env. Health : A\n03/17/2011 Inspection Completed-Fire Safety : A\nIII. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThe facility is a twelve bed residential facility. As there were only nine beds present at\nthe time of inspection, the facility is initially licensed for nine residents. When additional\nbeds are in place, the license can be modified to create a twelve bed facility.\nThe facility was immaculately clean, freshly painted, freshly carpeted, and had new\ncounters, appliances, and furniture. There is more than adequate indoor and outdoor\nrecreation space.\nB. Program Description\nThis Transitional Living Center Program will be coordinated by live-in house parents\nwith a rotating staff presence. Staffing will be at a 6:1 ratio. The Federal Division of\nUnaccompanied Children’s Services [DUCS] will refer residents to this residential\ntreatment program. Initially, some of the already identified residents will be Spanish\nspeaking 16 and 17-year-old males from Central and South America.\nResidency is voluntary and proposed residents have earned placement through their\ncommitments made while living in refugee camps. Residents are not orphans, but are\nnot able to live with their families because of issues such as displacement and civil war.\nResidents will be taught community living skills as well as receiving a formal education\nand language skills. Activities are also provided. Residents work towards independent\nliving.\nThe program is identical to the Ridgeview Program that is on Bethany’s Eastern Avenue\nCampus and utilizes the same policies and procedures.\nAll staff records have been reviewed and all staff have been well trained and\nappropriately screened.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe facility is in compliance with all licensing rules.\n2",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that a provisional license be issued to this child caring institution,\nwith an initial capacity of 9.\n03/17/2011\nSteve Ragsdale Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n03/17/2011\nGregory Corrigan Date\nArea Manager\n3"
