INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection • (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nDescription suitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 1/23/25, foster care was monitoring a visit transfer between\nparents and the youth playfully threw snow at the foster care\nworker. The foster care worker made an inappropriate statement\nand appeared angry making both parents uncomfortable.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nParent A was interviewed by phone on 1/29/2025. She requested\nAdvanced In-Home Worker be present as a support person. She\nstated she and Youth A’s father live together; however, their\nparenting time is court ordered to take place separately. She\nstated on 1/23/2025, Parent B’s parenting time was supposed to\ntake place from 12:00-4:00pm. Foster Care Worker texted just\nbefore 11:30am stating he was close to the home with Youth A, so\nParent A had to quickly leave the home. When Parent A walked\nout of the home, Foster Care Worker and Youth A were already\nthere. Foster Care Worker told Youth A he could give Parent A a\nhug before she left, so Parent A hugged him. She stated she and\nYouth A threw a couple snowballs at one another then Parent A\ntold Youth A she had to leave. Parent A stated she didn’t see\nanything, but she heard Foster Care Worker say, \"you are lucky\nyou’re not my kid; I would kill you.” She stated Foster Care Worker\nsounded angry when he made the statement. Parent A then got\ninto Advanced In-Home Worker’s car and Advanced In-Home\nWorker asked Parent A how she felt about Foster Care Worker’s\ncomment. She stated the comment made her uncomfortable.\nAdvanced In-Home Worker was interviewed by phone on\n1/29/2025. She reported she arrived to pick up Parent A to bring\nher to the laundromat at approximately 11:25am. Advanced In-\nHome Worker stated she also had her intern in her car. Foster\nCare Worker arrived shortly after with Youth A. Advanced In-\nHome Worker was in her car with her window down and said\n“wow, you’re here early” to Foster Care Worker. Advanced In-\nHome Worker stated Youth A’s parents aren’t supposed to be\n2",
    "home during each other’s parenting times and Foster Care Worker\nknows he’s not supposed to be there that early. Advanced In-\nHome Worker saw Parent A and Youth A throw snowballs at one\nanother and saw Youth A throw snow at Foster Care Worker. The\nsnow hit Foster Care Worker’s neck after which Foster Care\nWorker angrily stated, “you are lucky you are not my kid, or I\nwould kill you.” Advanced In-Home Worker stated Foster Care\nWorker looked at her when he made the comment, so she knows\nhe knows she heard him. Advanced In-Home Worker added that\nFoster Care Worker has a history of saying things like this in the\npast resulting in him being put on leave. She also added Foster\nCare Worker has since been assigned only one case, at which\npoint the conversation was redirected as Parent A and Parent B\nwere present.\nParent B was interviewed by phone on 1/29/2025 and 2/6/2025.\nHe reported he was on the sidewalk and saw Youth A grab snow\nand toss it at Foster Care Worker in a playful manner. He heard\nFoster Care Worker say, “you’re lucky you’re not my kid” but didn’t\nhear what was said after that as his focus was on how angry\nFoster Care Worker was. Parent B stated he was more concerned\nwith Foster Care Worker’s angry demeanor than the statement\nmade. Parent B stated Youth A immediately apologized to Foster\nCare Worker.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via video conferencing on\n1/20/2025. He reported he is primarily a monitor for PAFC cases\nbut has Youth A’s case assigned to him. He stated he picks Youth\nA up from school on Tuesdays and Thursday around 2:30pm then\npicks up Youth A’s sibling from that youth’s caregiver and arrives\nat Parent A and Parent B’s home for parenting time. Both parents\nhave unsupervised parenting time. Foster Care Worker stated\nparenting times takes place separately and the parents are not to\ncontact one another during the parenting times. He stated they are\nallowed to see and speak to one another during transition, but\nthey are supposed to parent individually during parenting times, so\ntheir ability to parent without the other parent present can be\nassessed. On 1/23/2025, Parent B was supposed to have\nparenting time from 12:00-4:00PM then Parent A 4:00-8:00PM.\nFoster Care Worker stated he was told Youth A was dismissed\nfrom school at 11:30AM that day, but he was released earlier than\nthat, so he arrived at Parent A and Parent B’s home early. He\nstated Parent A was still home and Advanced In-Home Worker\nwas there to pick up Parent A. He stated Youth A gave Parent A a\nhug before Parent A got into Advanced In-Home Worker’s car.\nYouth A threw snow at Foster Care Worker, and it hit the side of\n3",
    "his face and ran down into his shirt. Foster Care Worker stated he\ntook a deep breath and closed his eyes. After he opened his eyes,\nhe saw Youth A smirking. Foster Care Worker said, “ dude, if you\nwere my kid, your face would be in the snow.” Foster Care Worker\nstated Advanced In-Home Worker and an intern were in Advanced\nIn-Home Worker’s car with the window down and Parent A and\nParent B were present, so they likely all heard his comment.\nFoster Care Worker stated he then said, “don’t worry, dad will get\nyou back” after which Parent B threw snow at Youth A and said, “I\ngot him.” Foster Care Worker denied ever saying he would kill\nYouth A and added he would never say that to a foster youth. He\nstated he was attempting to hold his composer to the best of his\nability after being hit with the snow as this was not the first time\nYouth A has pushed Foster Care Worker’s personal boundaries.\nFoster Care Worker stated neither of the parents have mentioned\nanything to him about his comment.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 was interviewed via video\nconferencing on 1/30/2025. She stated she received an email\nfrom an Adoption Option, Inc Supervisor on 1/24/2205 indicating\nFoster Care Worker stated “you are lucky you are not my child, or\nI would kill you” to Youth A. Foster Care Supervisor 1 stated the\nfamily used to have an in-home worker through Adoption Option,\nInc but there is no longer a worker assigned; however, she\nbelieves the worker still provides support to the family. Foster\nCare Supervisor 1 stated she met with Foster Care Worker the\nfollowing Monday and told him what the email said. He told Foster\nCare Supervisor 1 he stated something along the lines of, if you\nwere my kid I would get you and your dad is going to get you.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 stated when Foster Care Worker\nrelayed this to her, he did not sound angry or upset. She reported\nFoster Care Worker has one direct care case assigned to him\nbecause he is primarily a monitor, so she does not have a lot of\nopportunity to see him interact with youth and families. She stated\nshe became his supervisor fairly recently and she has had no\nconcerns with his performance; however, he is currently under\nsome type of performance plan, but his former supervisor would\nhave more information about those specifics.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 was interviewed via video\nconferencing on 1/30/2025. She stated she was previously the\nassigned Foster Care Worker for Youth A’s case. When Foster\nCare Worker came under her as a supervisor, the case was\nassigned to Foster Care Worker as she was familiar with the case.\nShe stated there was an investigation approximately 2 years ago\ninto an inappropriate comment Foster Care Worker made. Foster\n4",
    "Care Worker had a one-day suspension and has since done a lot\nof work on boundaries. Foster Care Supervisor 2 stated Foster\nCare Worker’s personality is “overly jokey”, and he is a “no filter\nkind of guy.” She stated he demonstrated an increased awareness\nof boundaries and there have been no issues with him saying\nanything inappropriate in the past 2 years. She stated if he made\nthe alleged comment, he would not have had any malice behind it.\nShe added he is trying to be as appropriate as he can.\nAdoption Option Inc Intern was interviewed by phone on\n1/30/2025. She stated she was in the passenger seat of Advanced\nIn-Home Worker’s car at Parent A’s home on 1/23/2024. She\nstated they were parked in front of Parent A’s home when Foster\nCare Worker told Youth A he could give Parent A a hug. Adoption\nOption Inc Intern heard Parent A make a joke about a snowball\nfight with Youth A after which they threw some snowballs back\nand forth. Parent A then hugged Youth A, said goodbye, and\nwalked toward Advanced In-Home Worker’s car. Youth A then\nthrew some snow at Foster Care Worker’s face. Foster Care\nWorker seemed upset, but then turned and said, “if you were my\nchild, you would be dead.” Adoption Option Inc Intern stated she\ndoesn’t think Parent A heard Foster Care Worker say that and\nthey did not talk about it in the car.\nYouth A was interviewed by phone on 2/6/2025. He stated he\nremembered throwing snow at Foster Care Worker after which\nFoster Care Worker said, “if you were my kid, I would put your\nface in the snow.”\nAnalysis A violation is established as Foster Care Worker did not\ndemonstrate responsible character when making a comment to\nYouth A about either killing Youth A or putting Youth A’s face in\nthe snow after Youth A threw snow at him.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
