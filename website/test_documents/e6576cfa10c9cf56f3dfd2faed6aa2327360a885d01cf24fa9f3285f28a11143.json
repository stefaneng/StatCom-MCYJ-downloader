EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was 1 substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. The one Special Evaluation report in which maltreatment in care was",
    "established was completed thoroughly and resulted in the appropriate\nrecommendation of revocation.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe first CAP submitted by the agency was approved 7/24/2024 and was\nsubmitted in response to the 2024SIC0001473 Special Investigation Report dated\n7/11/2024.The one violation established during the investigation was related to the\nagency's failure to obtain a variance for a foster home in violation of a rule\nrequirement, timely. The CAP was successfully implemented and there have been\nno repeated violations.\nThe second CAP submitted by the agency was in response to the 2024 interim\nlicensing inspection dated 2/16/2024 and was approved on 3/12/2024. That CAP\naddressed 11 violations, 3 of which were policy violations no longer regulated\nduring licensing inspections. Of the remaining 8 violations, 3 were repeated\n(replacement documentation, service plan timeliness, and visits with youth in\nplacement) during this year's inspection and will need to be assessed as to why\nthe previous CAP was not effective and will require additional corrective action\nplanning. The 2024 CAP was successful in achieving compliance related to\npersonnel records, foster home licensure, initial service plan timeliness, and\nindependent living entry documentation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe report indicated internal process regarding case transfers and auditing\ndeveloped out of previous inspection CAPs helped maintain compliance during\ntransition. The chief administrator identified an increase in dependent youth with\nchronic mental health needs, disruptive behavioral needs, and substance abuse\nas an ongoing barrier to achieving compliance due to the time and attention\nneeded to secure appropriate placement, stabilize current placement, and ensure\nappropriate services are being consistently provided. The chief administrator\nidentified compliance with the previous year's CAP related to the use of CQI to\nengage staff to quickly address barriers, DCWL consultant periodic check in, as\nwell as program tech and management tracking data. Areas of the prior CAP that\nwere not successful were related to staff turnover and changes resulting in failure\nto provide consistent communication required by several of the prior cap action\nsteps.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews",
    "The staff members interviewed all reported there have been challenges this past\nyear with staffing losses and changes. They stated they receive support from their\nimmediate supervisors as well as the district manager and director. No concerns\nwere reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe office appeared to have adequate space and equipment to provide for the\ndelivery of foster home certification, foster care, and independent living services.\nFiles are stored in a secured file room with locked cabinets containing closed\nadoption files.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified one safety concern.\nSafety Alert: During a home visit on 11/12/2024, an unlicensed caregiver did not\nhave hot water due to the hot water heater not working.\nResolution: Kalamazoo DHHS staff completed a home visit on 12/13/2024 and\nverified the hot water heater had been repaired and the home had hot water.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nMarch 4, 2025\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 4, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
