INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Privacy safeguard\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12211\nSection (1) An agency shall safeguard the privacy of a child and his or her\nDescription family.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster care worker shared confidential case information with\nsignificant other for an unknown time period.\nInvestigation On 3/27/24 Complainant reported to Department of Child Welfare\nLicensing (DCWL) that Foster Care Worker (FCW) discussed her\ncases “openly and in detail”. Complainant made additional\nallegations against FCW regarding incidents that occurred during\ntheir personal relationship. Complainant was advised via email on\n3/27/24 that those concerns did not fall under the regulatory scope\nof DCWL. However, a breach of confidentiality would be\ninvestigated. Complainant was asked to provide additional\ninformation about any specific case information that was\ndiscussed openly. Complainant responded on 4/8/24 but did not\nprovide any information about the cases. Complainant continued\nto provide information about their personal relationship with FCW,\nwhich was not relevant to the allegation. On 4/11/24 Complainant\nwas contacted via email and asked to provide names or case\ndetails that FCW shared openly. On 4/11/24 Complainant\nresponded with additional information about their personal\nrelationship with FCW but did not provide any case information or\nevidence to support the allegation.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on 3/27/24.\nFCW initially contacted DCWL by email on 3/27/24 to report\nComplainant had contacted her. FCW provided a screen shot of a\ntext she received from Complainant. The screen shot was of the\nemail that DCWL sent to Complainant asking for additional\ninformation.

    "FCW reported she was in a long-term relationship with\nComplainant, which recently ended. This is not the first time\nComplainant told FCW they would get her fired unless she\nresumed their relationship. FCW reported she was in the process\nof obtaining a Personal Protection Order due to some recent\nincidents with Complainant. FCW reported Complainant had been\nmaking threats towards her for a very long time. FCW indicated\nthe relationship ended a few months ago, and unlike other times,\nshe has refused to resume the relationship. Which is what she\nbelieved escalated Complainant’s behavior. FCW was concerned\nabout how this investigation would impact her job. FCW stated\nthat prior to this incident, she spoke with her current supervisor\nand two previous supervisors regarding the ongoing issues with\nComplainant.\nRegarding the allegation, FCW stated she never shared case\ninformation with anyone, including Complainant. As FCW and\nComplainant lived together, it was possible he overheard her on\nsome phone calls. However, FCW always took calls in another\nroom and used headphones. Therefore, any information he\noverheard was a one-sided conversation and not intentional. FCW\nreported she had two clients that went to high school with\nComplainant. FCW never discussed these clients with\nComplainant, but he knew about their cases through mutual\nfriends.\nSupervisor was interviewed via video call on 4/12/24.\nSupervisor reported she has been the manager for FCW since\nSeptember 2023. Supervisor reported there was no disciplinary\naction on file regarding FCW. Supervisor also reported she did not\nhave any concerns of FCW sharing confidential case information,\nnor had she received any complaints from clients. Supervisor\nverified that she has observed threatening personal emails that\nComplainant had sent to FCW. Supervisor was aware of the\nongoing struggles FCW had with Complainant and indicated he\ntried to control her by making threats to call her boss and get her\nin trouble. However, Complainant has never called Supervisor.\nPrevious Supervisor 1 (PS1) answered interview questions\nvia email on 4/15/24. PS1 reported she supervised FCW from\n2018-2022. PS1 never had any concerns of FCW sharing\nconfidential information. PS1 was aware of Complainant making\nthreats toward FCW during that time. FCW spoke with PS1 about\nComplainant making threats that he would do something to make\nher lose her job. However, PS1 never received allegations from\nanyone.\n3",
    "Previous Supervisor 2 (PS2) answered interview questions\nvia email on 4/15/24. PS2 reported she supervised FCW from\nMay 2022 through September 2023. PS2 never had concerns of\nFCW sharing confidential information. PS2 reported they were\naware of Complainant making threats that he would do something\nto make FCW lose her job. PS2 never received allegations from\nanyone.\nDocuments reviewed:\nPersonal Protection Order against complainant granted 4/2/24.\nAnalysis As there was no evidence provided by the complainant of case\nspecific information being shared in public, no violation was found.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n_ ______________April 17, 2024_______________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 18, 2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4"
