Therapist Z\nsaid she was the on-call therapist the weekend of April 15, 2023.\nTherapist Z said she had received a call regarding an incident with\nYouth A at Putnam on April 14, 2023, which resulted in Youth A\nbeing placed on a safety plan. Therapist Z said on April 15, 2023,\nshe followed up with Youth A to process what had occurred the\nnight prior. Therapist Z said while talking with Youth A he\ndisclosed that he had been sexually assaulted while placed at\nHainley (this is being investigated under SIR 2023C0000396).\nTherapist Z said that Youth B “sexually abused” him in the shower\non April 14, 2023, when staff were not looking. Therapist Z said\nYouth A told her Youth B “grabbed him and pulled him in the\nshower”. Therapist Z said Youth A did not go into any additional\ndetail at the time and she did not ask any other questions due to\nknowing there would be a full investigation. Therapist Z said after\ntalking with Youth A he had a visit with his parents and asked she\ntell them about the incidents. Therapist Z said Youth A was\npresent when she told the parents what he had disclosed to her as\nwell as what Supervisor reported Youth A had disclosed to him.\nTherapist Z said Youth A did not deny or try to change what he\nhad told Supervisor. Therapist Z said Youth A’s father had no\nreaction and his mother just was concerned that Youth A was kept\nsafe, and a safety plan was in place and followed for him.\nTherapist Z said Youth A was very preoccupied with his\n“consequences” from the shower incident and repeatedly stated\nhe wanted to be able to play his PS5 and be off grounding.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on April\n18, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth A\nsaid he was previously placed at Hainley and is currently placed at\nPutnam. Youth A said “on Friday” he was taking a shower at the\nsame time as Youth B when Youth B came into his shower stall\n2",
    "and “sexually abused” him. Youth A was unable to give any details\nof this incident. Youth A was asked if Staff 1 saw him crawling\nunder a shower stall door to which Youth A replied yes. Youth A\nsaid he got into his shower and realized he needed to use the\nbathroom “really bad” and so crawled under the shower stall door\nand used the bathroom. Youth A said once he was done using the\nbathroom he went to get back into his shower and realized his\nstall door was locked so had to crawl back under it and that was\nwhen Staff 1 saw him. Youth A said it was then that he told Staff 1\nabout Youth B sexually assaulting him. Youth A said he is now on\na safety plan with five-minute checks and does not think that is fair\nand does not want to be on a safety plan. Youth A said he is also\ngrounded and therefore cannot play his PS5 and feels that is also\nunfair. Youth A said he told Foster Care Worker about the sexual\nassault with Youth B “right away”. Youth A denied telling\nSupervisor that he was the one that attempted to sexually assault\nYouth B. Youth A denied ever attempting to sexually touch Youth\nB or any other youth.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on April\n18, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth B\nsaid over the weekend he was taking a shower and Youth A tried\nto “crawl under the stall” but he “kicked him out”. Youth B said no\nstaff were around, so he began to call for staff, however no one\ncame. Youth B said Youth A reached to try to touch his penis but\nwas not able to reach far enough to touch him. Youth B said he\ntold Supervisor the same night it happened. Youth B said this was\nthe first time Youth A has tried to sexually touch him however\npreviously they have gotten into verbal and physical altercations\nbecause Youth A is “mean to him”. Youth B said Youth C told him\nthat Youth A tried to sexually touch him one time while they were\noutside. Youth B said he is unaware of any other youth that Youth\nA has been sexually inappropriate with.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on April\n19, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker.

Youth\nC denied ever being outside without staff supervising. Youth C\ndenied ever touching or attempting to touch him sexually. Youth C\nsaid if Youth A did ever attempt to touch him he would tell\nTherapist Y right away.\nTherapist Y was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nApril 18, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker.\n3",
    "Therapist Y said Youth A recently moved from Hainley to Putnam\nand therefore she is just starting to get to know him. Therapist Y\nsaid she had no knowledge of any sexual assaults or abuse of\nYouth A while he was at Hainley. Therapist Y said Youth A does\nhave history of being sexually abused while in his mother’s care\nas well as in a previous residential placement, not Eagle Village.\nTherapist Y said Youth A has never disclosed any sexual assaults\nto her. Therapist said she is not aware of any sexual acting out\nbehaviors with Youth A other than a “moaning” he will do at times\nwhich upsets his peers but appeared more like a behavioral issue\nrather than a sexual issue. Therapist Y said she talked to Foster\nCare Worker after she had met with Youth A and Foster Care\nWorker did not tell her that Youth A disclosed anything about\nsexual abuse in their meeting. Therapist Y said she is also the\ntherapist for Youth B, and he has never disclosed anything at all\nregarding Youth A to her.\nSupervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nApril 18, 2023, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker.\nSupervisor said he was working on Friday with Staff 1 and Youth\nA, Youth B, and Youth C. Supervisor said that Staff 1 was\nsupervising Youth A and Youth B in the shower while Youth C was\ndoing “reflection time”. Supervisor said he was standing by Staff 1\ntalking when they noticed Youth A looking through the crack of his\nshower stall at staff. Supervisor said he thought that was odd and\nso told Youth A he had five minutes to finish up his shower.\nSupervisor said he directed Staff 1 to stand to the side of the\nhallway so they could still see the shower area, but the youth\ncould not see them. Supervisor said at that point Youth A looked\nunder his door and said “Hey [Youth B]” and Staff 1 redirected\nYouth A telling him “No talking during showers” to which Youth A\nsaid “ok”. Supervisor said a few moments later Youth A was\ncrawling under his shower stall door saying “[Youth B] do you\nwant to have sex with me?” Supervisor said he immediately\nintervened and told Youth A to get his things as his shower time\nwas over. Supervisor said Youth C had been walking down the\nhallway at the same time Youth A was crawling under his shower\ndoor and witnessed the incident as well. Supervisor said after\nYouth A got dressed, he took him aside and asked him about the\nincident. Supervisor said Youth A must have thought Youth C told\nhim about it and immediately started telling him that Youth C “is a\nliar and lying about the shower”. Supervisor said he did not\nengage any further as Youth A was clearly upset but later talked\nto him in the staff office. Supervisor said during that conversation\nhe asked Youth A why he would attempt to crawl under the\nshower door and ask Youth B to have sex, to which Youth A\n4",
    "stated he did not understand why staff “are making such a big\ndeal about it” as he “fucked a couple kids over there [Hainley\nHouse] and they turned out fine” (This is being investigated in SIR\n2023C0000396). Supervisor said he told Youth A he wanted to\nkeep all the youth safe at Putnam, telling him he will be on a\nsafety plan and need to keep a safe distance from Youth B to\nwhich Youth A replied, “that’s fine I’ll do it when no one is looking”.\nSupervisor said Youth A told him that Youth B is “easy” which is\nwhy he picked him to ask about having sex. Supervisor said he\nhad no prior information that Youth A had sexually inappropriate\nbehaviors with other youth at Hainley or any other placement.\nSupervisor said he has never had any issues with Youth B acting\nout sexually. Supervisor said he has no knowledge of Youth A and\nYouth C being sexually inappropriate.

Staff 1 said he\nwas supervising Youth A and Youth B while they were taking\nshowers on April 14, 2023.

Staff 1 said he told Youth A he is not\nallowed to be talking to peers while showering.
