Staff 1 allowed Youth B to \"suck Youth A's dick.\"\nThe incident occurred at the Grand Rapids YMCA.\nInvestigation Administrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/6/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker.

He\nreported Staff 1 is the staff who primarily takes youth to the Y-\ncenter. Youth A reported Youth B and Youth D will “wrestle around\nlike “normal teenagers” and they appear to treat each other like a\n“brother and sister”.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/6/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker.

There is always a male and female staff present if\nthere are female and male youth going on the outing. Youth B\nreported his relationship with Youth D began prior to placement\nbecause they both attended the same school and became friends.\nThey will wrestle but not out of anger more like brother and sister.\nStaff always tell them to stop and try to get between them.

    "reported being told about Staff 1 letting Youth B get “head” from\nYouth D while at the Y-center by Youth A. Youth C believed Youth\nA said this because Youth A wanted to go to the park rather than\nthe Y-center again. Youth C reported this “getting head” must\nhave happened in the family bathroom because that is the one\nplace youth can go together and sometimes staff don’t pay\nattention. Staff 1 can be busy playing basketball and we can go\nwherever we want to go as long as we return to the basketball\ncourt. Everyone heard Youth A report this, but no one saw\nanything.\nYouth D refused to be interviewed at the facility on 2/6/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at home on 2/8/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker.

They will use\nthe family bathroom when swimming, but line of site must be in\nplace for supervision. Supervisor 1 also reported having no\nconcerns about staff’s supervision during Y-center outing. She has\nobserved Youth B and Youth D’s interactions and believes they\nare friends who attend the same school.

Providing redirection in a positive manner\nand if they don’t stop staff are to call for support from another\nstaff.\nStaff 7 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/8/2024\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported not being told\nabout the allegations between Youth B and Youth D at the Y-\ncenter. He reported the similar supervision requirements when\nstaff take youth on an outing.
