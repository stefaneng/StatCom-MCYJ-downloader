    "Investigation I reviewed intake dated 04/03/2023. It states that on 04/02/2023\nat noon Staff Person 1 asked Youth A to flash him while doing\ncleaning detail and that she did. Complainant and Probation\nOfficer has nothing else to add to the allegations.\nI reviewed Staff Person 2’s email to the facility’s program\ncommunications personnel. It states allegations of Staff Person 1\nasking Youth A to flash him while cleaning the pantry after lunch\non 04/02/2023 came about when one resident informed other\nresidents which eventually got to staff. Youth A denied the\nallegations when asked by staff and made threats toward Youth B.\nYouth B reports Youth A informing her of the allegations later in\nthe day and that she did not observe anything.\nI reviewed video surveillance of the kitchen area dated 04/02/2023\nwith DHHS Worker. Staff Person 1 and Youth A are not observed\ntogether in the kitchen between 10:30am and 2:00pm as the\nalleged incident occurred after lunch. Staff Person 1 and Youth A\nare observed walking into the kitchen at 07:55am. Staff Person 1\nstands outside the pantry door and near an exterior door. Youth A\nis observed walking into the pantry at 07:55am and exits in less\nthan one second with a loaf of bread and the two walk out the\nexterior door. Staff Person 1 is observed looking through the\nexterior doors window for approximately half the time he stood\nthere. The other half of the time he appears to be directed toward\nthe pantry though does not appear to be focused on what is inside\nthe pantry.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite with DHHS Worker on 04/04/2023.\nWhen asked if she knew why she was to be interviewed, Youth A\nstated that she knew and that it was a lie regarding Staff Person 1\nasking to see her breasts. Youth A denies Staff Person 1 asking\nher to expose herself to him and denies exposing herself to him.\nYouth A was notably upset and then began talking about the\nabuse she endured prior to placement and why nothing was done\nabout it then. She reports discussing her past with another\nunidentified resident approximately one month ago and that she\ndoes not know why Youth B said anything noting that Youth B is\nnot her friend, though Youth C is. Youth A reports once the\nallegations started to spread that she had to speak with\nComplainant in which she denied Staff Person 1 asking her to\nexpose herself.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 onsite with DHHS Worker on\n04/04/2023. He was accompanied to the interview by Union\n2",
    "Steward. He reports being employed by the facility since 10/2005\nwith no disciplinary issues and is up to date with training hours.\nThe allegations were read to Staff Person 1 which he denies as\noccurring and denies ever being inappropriate. He reports he and\nYouth A entered the kitchen sometime in the morning and that she\nwalked into the pantry to retrieve some bread to feed the squirrels,\nwhereas he stood outside the pantry at the door leading to the\noutdoors. Staff Person 1 denies Youth A exposing herself to him\nand denies asking her to flash him as alleged.\nI interviewed Staff Person 3 onsite with DHHS Worker on\n04/04/2023. He reports being employed by the facility for 18\nyears and knows Staff Person 1. He reports never observing\nanything inappropriate with Staff Person 1 and notes that he has\ngood character.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite with DHHS Worker on 04/04/2023.\nShe states she and Youth A are not friends and was surprised that\nshe approached her. Youth B states she was in the living room\nduring the middle of the day when Youth A approached her and\ntold her that Staff Person 1 asked her to flash him in the pantry\naround noon on 04/02/2023. Youth B states she informed other\nresidents of what Youth A disclosed which eventually got to the\nsupervisors. Youth B states Staff Person 1 is a good person and\nthat she knows Youth A likes him noting that Youth A has made\ncomments like “He’s my man” in the past. Youth B states she is\nnot Youth A’s friend and was confused that she did not disclose\nsuch information to Youth C.\nI interviewed Youth C onsite with DHHS Worker on 04/04/2023.\nShe states being friends with Youth A and that Youth A informed\nher of the allegations involving Staff Person 1 the same day it\nhappened noting that it was either Thursday or Friday. Youth C\nthen changed her timeframe of events to Sunday, 04/04/2023.\nShe states Youth A went inside the pantry sometime between\n08:30am and 09:00am and that he asked her to flash him and that\nshe complied while inside the pantry. Youth C states Youth A has\npreviously stated to her that she “wants to (expletive) Staff Person\n1”. When asked if Youth C had knowledge of Staff Person 1 ever\nbeing inappropriate with anyone else Youth C appeared to\nbecome excited. Youth C stated that a former unidentified youth\ninformed another youth that Staff Person 1 was inappropriate but\ndid not know how. When asked if Staff Person 1 had been\ninappropriate with her she repeatedly said, “I don’t know” and\n“This is weird” and appeared excited about the question. Youth C\ngoes on to state that Staff Person 1 asked her one time if her\n3",
    "sister was shaped like her, as well as stating, “Eating pineapple\nmakes my nuts sweet”.\nDHHS Worker reports no findings.\nAnalysis There is no conclusive evidence to substantiate the allegations of\nStaff Person 1 asking Youth A to flash him in the pantry. Youth A\ndenies that the alleged incident occurred and states it is a lie.\nInitial reports from Youth B and indicate the alleged incident\noccurred after lunchtime on 04/04/2023. Review of video\nsurveillance does not show Staff Person 1 and Youth A in the\nkitchen between 10:30am and 2:00pm. Youth C reports being\ninformed by Youth A that the alleged incident occurred between\n08:30am and 09:00am on 03/30 or 03/31/2023 then changed her\ntimeframe to 04/02/2023. Video surveillance shows Staff Person\n1 and Youth A walk into the kitchen at 07:55am. Staff Person 1\nstands outside the pantry door and near an exterior door. Youth A\nis observed walking into the pantry at 07:55am and exits at\n07:56am with a loaf of bread and the two walk out the exterior\ndoor. Staff Person 1 is observed looking through the exterior\ndoors window for approximately half the time he stood there. The\nother half of the time he appears to be directed toward the pantry\nthough does not appear to be focused on what is inside the\npantry.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n04/27/2023\n______________________________________\nChristopher M Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 9, 2023\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4",
