Compliance\nExit Conference\nOn June 16, 2020, a special investigation was initiated into the allegations\ndescribed above. Agency staff were interviewed as well as the complainant.\nDocuments were reviewed. What follows is information obtained from the\naforementioned sources.\n2",
    "ALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that the agency worker was not making the required monthly\nvisits to the home.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn June 16, 2020, a telephone call was placed to the Complainant and a message\nleft.\nOn July 1, 2020 a phone interview was conducted with the Complainant. She offered\nthe following information. She reported that the agency Foster Care Worker, hereafter\nreferred to as Staff 1, was not making visits to the foster home as required. She also\nreported that Staff 1 and the agency Supervisor falsified documentation of a home\nvisit contact. The Complainant reported that the submission of a service plan to the\nCourt was late and that parent progress on goals were not documented. The\nComplainant further reported that the agency had not followed up on reasonable\nefforts towards reunification.\nOn August 27, 2020 the agency Chief Administrator was interviewed. She reported\nthat a January 22, 2020 social work contact was listed as a foster home visit but was\na parenting time visit in the bio-parents home. She reported that the contact narrative\nindicates that the visit was a parenting time visit in the bio-parents home. The Chief\nAdministrator reported that Staff 1 mistakenly entered that the visit was a foster home\nvisit.\nDocument Review:\nA review of the social work contacts indicates that the January 22, 2020 visit is\ndocumented as a visit to the foster home yet the narrative indicates that the visit was\nto the bio-parent home. Additional review of the contacts indicates that there were no\nvisits by Staff 1 to the foster home for January 2020 and March, 2020, and no visit to\nthe home occurred in November 2019.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nAn agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nparenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the\nfollowing:\n(b) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster\nchild and the foster parent in the foster parent's home at\nleast once every month.\n3",
    "ANALYSIS: The Chief Administrator acknowledged that the January 22,\n2020 visit was a parenting time visit at the bio-parents home and\nnot a visit to the foster home as listed on the contact.\nThe review of contacts indicates that monthly contacts to the\nfoster home did not occur in November 2019, and January\n2020. There was not a video conference contact with the foster\nfamily in March 2020.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that a staff person and the supervisor falsified a social work\ncontact.\nDuring the interview with the Chief Administrator on August 27, 2020, she reported\nthat it was believed that Staff 1 mistakenly documented the January 22, 2020 as a\nvisit to the foster home instead of a parenting time visit. The Chief Administrator\nreported that the narrative of the visit indicates that it was to and with the bio-parent\nhome, not the foster home. The Chief Administrator reported that Staff 1 was a new\nemployee, hired September 30, 2019, and was struggling meeting the\nresponsibilities of the position. Staff 1 left the agency on June 19, 2020.\nOn August 31, 2020, the Clinical Foster Care Supervisor was interviewed. She\nreported that Staff 1 was struggling to meet the demands of the position. She\nreported that the January 22, 2020 visit to the bio-parent home was mistakenly\ndocumented as a foster home visit. She denied that she knew of any attempt by\nStaff 1 to falsify a social work contact. She denied falsifying a social work contact.\nStaff 1 was not interviewed as she is no longer employed by the agency.\nDocument Review:\nAs indicated previously under the document review above the January 22, 2020,\nsocial work contact narrative suggests that the visit took place in the bio-parent\nhome and not the foster home.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff Qualifications\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\ncontact with children or parents to be a person who has the\nability, experience, education, and training to perform the\nduties assigned.\nANALYSIS: The Chief Administrator and Clinical Foster Care Supervisor\nreported that identifying the January 22, 2020 visit location as\nthe foster home was a mistake by Staff 1.\nThe social work contact suggests that the visit took place in the\nbio-parent home and if Staff 1 was attempting to falsify a visit to\nthe foster home she would not have generated a narrative\nindicating that the visit occurred in the foster home, not the bio-\nparent home.\nThe supervisor denied falsifying a social work contact.\nEvidence indicates that Staff 1 mistakenly documented the visit\nas a visit to the foster home.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that the agency worker did not assess and document parent\nprogress towards goals in the service plan.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDocument Review:\nA review of a service plan and parent/agency treatment plan dated February 21,\n2020 to May 20, 2020 lacked documentation of bio-parent progress towards\ntreatment goals. Where progress should have been documented there was the\nword “Partial” with no supporting narrative, or “NA” was indicated.\nDuring the August 27, 2020 interview with the Chief Administrator she could not\naccount for a lack documented progress and referred me to the program supervisor.\nOn August 31, 2020, the Clinical Foster Care Supervisor acknowledged there was a\nfailure to assess bio-parent progress towards goals and document any progress.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12420 Updated service plans.\nAn updated service plan, as required in R 400.12418(2)(b),\nshall include all of the following information.\n(d) Assessment of progress in achieving the permanency\ngoal for the child.\nANALYSIS: The Chief Administrator and Clinical Foster Care Supervisor\nacknowledged that an assessment of progress was not\ndocumented in the service plan/PATP. A review of the PATP\nnoted that progress was not documented.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that the agency did not provide the service plan in a timely manner\nto the Court as required by policy.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the August 27, 2020 interview with the Chief Administrator she reported that\nStaff 1 had mistakenly sent to the Court a July 2019 Child Protective Services report\nprior to the June 4, 2020 Court hearing. The February 21, 2020 to May 20, 2020,\nUSP was not sent to the Court prior to the June 4, 2020 Court hearing. She reported\nthat the USP should have been sent along with the agency Updated Court report\ndated May 22, 2020.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-09 Foster Care – Updated Service Plan\nA copy of the USP must be sent to the court prior to the\nregularly scheduled review. Through the USP, the foster care\nworker updates the court on progress and makes\nrecommendations regarding services and on-going planning\nfor the child and family. At the review the court may modify\nthe plan.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: The Chief Administrator acknowledged that Staff 1 had not sent\nthe USP to the Court prior to the June 4, 2020 Court hearing.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that the agency did not provide reasonable efforts towards\nreunification.\nDocument Review:\nA review of a Court report addendum dated June 12, 2020, and the file, indicates\nthat various services for the bio-parents have been provided. They are Individual\ncounseling for each bio parent through a counselor at Alcona Behavioral Heath,\nMSU Extension on-line parenting classes during the COVID restrictions, and a\nreferral for Supportive Visitation program at Catholic Human Services. There was\nalso a referral for the bio-father to Old Town Psychological, and psychological\nevaluations for each bio-parent were conducted. Gas cards and other services were\nprovided.\nA review of parenting time in the social work contacts indicates that parenting time,\nin person and via video conferencing during COVID has been occurring 2-3 times\nweekly. FTM’s have been held at the required junctures.\nDuring the August 27, 2020, interview with the Chief Administrator she reported that\nin person parenting time was suspended during COVD and the Court did not feel\nthat on-line parenting was sufficient. She also reported that the counselor for each\nbio-parent would not return phone calls or provide the agency with counseling\nattendance records for each bio-parent. The counselor was eventually subpoenaed\nby the Court and at the Court hearing the agency received attendance reports. The\nChief Administrator reiterated services documented in the Court report and the file.\nOn August 31, 2020, Staff 2, a Foster Care Worker for the case, was interviewed.\nShe reported that she had made several attempts to obtain counseling reports for\nthe bio-parents from the counselor and only received them at a recent Court hearing.\nShe reported that the bio-parents are attending Supportive Visitation, a 12-14 week\nprogram through Catholic Human Services. She stated that the Court has approved\nof this program.\nDocument Review:\nThe foster care file was reviewed.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-08C Parent/Agency Treatment Plan\nThe treatment plan and services agreement should be specific\nto the individual needs of the family and child(ren), express\ntheir view-points and be written in a manner easily understood\nby the family with expected outcomes clearly defined.\nANALYSIS: A review of documents, social work contacts, and the file\nindicate that reasonable efforts have been provided to the bio-\nparents to assist in reunification. Interviews with the Chief\nAdministrator and Staff 2 support that reasonable efforts are\nbeing made.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan the recommendation is for\ncontinuance of the regular license.\nSeptember 3, 2020\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n_____________________________________September 4, 2020___\nCourtney Atkins Date\nArea Manager\n8"
