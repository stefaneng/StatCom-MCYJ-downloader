    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A few months ago, staff member cussed at a youth and said,\n“stupid ass bitch, you don’t cuss at me” after youth cussed at him.\nAnother youth heard this happen. There was also another\nunknown female staff around who heard it. A few months ago,\nsame staff went to youth’s bedroom and tickled her feet while she\nwas sleeping. Another youth saw this happen and told an\nunknown 3rd shift staff member about it. That 3rd shift staff\nmember no longer works at the facility.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nThe Complainant is this Consultant. This information was\ndisclosed by Youth A during an interview regarding a separate\ninvestigation.\nYouth A was interviewed via phone on 2/15/24. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 cussed at Youth B by saying “stupid ass bitch,\nyou don’t cuss at me” after Youth B cussed at Staff 1. Youth A\nreported it happened a few months ago and she was present\nduring the exchange and heard it. Youth A reported another day a\nfew months ago, Staff 1 went to Youth B’s bedroom while she was\nsleeping and tickled Youth B’s feet. Youth A reported she was\nstanding in the hallway outside of the bedroom, saw it happen and\ntold Staff 1 to “get out of there, that’s not right”. Youth A reported\nYouth B woke up when it happened. Youth A reported Youth B\ntold Staff 4 about the incident today but isn’t sure if Youth B ever\ntold anyone prior to today. Youth A reported she told a third shift\nstaff member about the incident when it happened but was unable\nto provide a name or description of the staff member other than it\nwas someone who no longer worked at the facility.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/20/24.\nYouth B reported a few months ago, she and Staff 1 were talking\nabout something, and she got mad about something Staff 1 said,\nso she told him to “shut up”. Youth B reported Staff 1 replied “don’t\n2",
    "fucking tell me to shut up” in a loud tone. Youth B reported she\ncould tell Staff 1 was angry because he was tense, and his fists\nwere balled up. Youth B reported after the exchange, they walked\naway from each other and “it wasn’t a big deal”. Youth B reported\nStaff 2 was present during the exchange and she thinks Staff 2\nheard what happened. Youth B reported a couple days after the\nexchange, she met with Therapist/Chief Administrator (CA) and\ntold him Staff 1 was frustrated with her and cussed at her. Youth B\nreported Therapist/CA told her he would have a talk with Staff 1\nabout it. Youth B reported she hadn’t had any issues with Staff 1\nprior to or after that incident. Youth B reported she has never\nheard him cuss at anyone else, and she thinks he was just\nfrustrated at the time. Youth B reported she doesn’t know about a\ntime when he came in and tickled her feet when she was sleeping.\nYouth B reported she doesn’t know why anyone would say\nsomething like that and doesn’t believe anything like that\nhappened.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/20/24.\nStaff 1 reported more than a month ago, but not sure exactly\nwhen, he and Youth B had a disagreement. Staff 1 reported Youth\nB woke up one morning and asked for two cereals and two brown\nsugars. Staff 1 reported he is a stickler for youth having too much\nprocessed sugar because a youth he previously worked with at\nanother job developed diabetes while in placement. Staff 1\nreported the cereal Youth B was requesting already had sugar in\nit, so he felt two brown sugar packets was too much and declined\nYouth B’s request. Youth B said she was allowed to if she wanted\nit. Staff 1 informed her they have rules about portions and food\nthey provide, and mentioned all the excess sugar could cause\ndiabetes. Staff 1 reported Youth B was very upset with his\nresponse and started “going off”. Staff 1 reported he responded by\nburying his head in his hands and said, “your fucking pancreas is\ngoing to die”. Staff 1 told Youth B the reason he said no to her\nwas for a medical reason, not a personal reason. Youth B told\nStaff 1 to shut up because he was pissing her off. Staff 1 reported\nhe said “don’t talk to me like that. I’m not your slave. I’m a human\nbeing and you don’t need to treat me like that” and walked away\nfrom the table. Staff 1 reported he was attempting to set a very\nfirm boundary with her by being stern, but afterwards he felt she\nprobably thought he was yelling at her, even though he wasn’t\nyelling. Staff 1 reported he felt bad afterwards because he doesn’t\nwant to leave a negative effect on the youth he's working with.\nStaff 1 reported after the exchange, there was some tension\nbetween them. Staff 1 reported looking back on it, he wishes he\nwould have stood up from the table, told her they could talk about\n3",
    "it another time, and walked away. Staff 1 reported he feels it\nbecame more of a problem because other staff would probably\ngive her two sugars, so youth have a hard time adapting to those\ninconsistencies. Staff 1 reported he later apologized to Youth B for\nany additional stress he caused her during their exchange. He\nreported he never called Youth B a “stupid ass bitch” and never\nsaid “don’t fucking tell me to shut up”. Staff 1 reported there has\nnever been a time when he’s tickled Youth B’s feet while she was\nin her room sleeping. Staff 1 reported the only time he would ever\ntickle a youth’s feet would be if he has a good relationship with\nthem, if they were in the milieu, and they welcomed it. Staff 1\nreported he’s very cautious about the physical touch he utilizes\nwith youth.\nTherapist/CA was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/20/24. Therapist/CA reported one time in therapy, Youth B\nstated Staff 1 made her feel uncomfortable, but also said he was a\ngood staff member. Therapist/CA asked Youth B why Staff 1\nmade her feel uncomfortable, and Youth B replied, “I don’t know,\nhe just does”. Therapist/CA reported subsequently, he made the\ndecision to move Staff 1 to a different pod since Youth B stated\nStaff 1 made her uncomfortable. Therapist/CA reported he has\nnever received any reports or concerns of Staff 1 cussing at, or\ntickling Youth B. Therapist/CA reported Youth B stated Staff 1 was\nsterner with her more than normal one time, but she never stated\nStaff 1 cussed at her.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 2/21/24. Staff 2 reported\nin the last couple of months, there was a time she was sitting at a\ntable with Youth B and Staff 1, and they were having a verbal\nconfrontation with each other. Staff 2 reported Youth B was very\nupset and told Staff 1 to shut up. Staff 2 reported Staff 1\nresponded by saying “Don’t treat me like I’m a slave” and “Don’t\ntalk to me like that”. Staff 2 reported Youth B and Staff 1 were\nboth upset and after the exchange, Staff 1 walked away. Staff 2\nreported she did not hear Staff 1 cuss at Youth B at any point\nduring the conversation. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was not yelling\nbut was direct during the conversation. Staff 2 reported she feels\nStaff 1 should have handled the situation differently because\nweight can be a trigger for youth, and him mentioning diabetes\ncan make a youth think he is talking about the youth’s weight.\nStaff 2 also felt Staff 1 saying “don’t treat me like a slave” was\ninappropriate for multiple reasons.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 2/21/24. Staff 3 was a\nthird shift staff member who no longer works at the facility. Staff 3\n4",
    "reported she has never heard of Staff 1 tickling Youth B’s feet\nwhile she was sleeping in her room, and Staff 3 never witnessed\nanything regarding that either.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 2/21/24. Staff 4 reported\nYouth B has never reported an incident to her about Staff 1\ntickling her feet while she was sleeping. Staff 4 reported last week\nYouth B told her Staff 1 made her feel uncomfortable and she\ndidn’t like him but wouldn’t go into detail as to why she felt that\nway.\nAn attempt was made to interview Staff 5 via phone on\n2/21/24, but the only phone number the facility had for her\nwas a non-working phone number. Staff 5 was a third shift staff\nmember who no longer works at the facility.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via phone on 2/21/24. Staff 6 was a\nthird shift staff member who no longer works at the facility. Staff 6\nreported she does not know who Staff 1 is. Staff 6 reported she\nhas never heard of Staff 1 tickling Youth B’s feet while she was\nsleeping in her room, and Staff 6 never witnessed anything\nregarding that either.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services Recipient\nRights C-1 Policy states the program actively promotes the\nsafeguarding of recipient rights and respect for recipient’s\ncultural, psychosocial, and spiritual values within the\ntreatment environment.

There is no evidence to support Staff 1 tickled Youth B’s\nfeet while she was sleeping.\nCONSULTATION:\n- Staff are not experts in all fields based on their own\npersonal experiences. If there are concerns with potential\nmedical issues, mental health issues, etc., they need to rely\non professionals and experts in those fields to explore\nthose topics with youth. In this situation, if there was a\nconcern for potential diabetes, Staff 1 should have\ncontacted nursing or a nutritionist to ask for further direction\nand/or have these individuals speak to Youth B.\n- Staff should be cautious about the physical touch they\nutilize with youth, even if the relationship between them is\ngood and youth welcome it.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(a) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Rule Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff was unprofessional in interactions with youth.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/20/24.\nDuring the incident in question, Staff 1 reported he responded by\nburying his head in his hands and said, “your fucking pancreas is\ngoing to die” towards Youth B.
