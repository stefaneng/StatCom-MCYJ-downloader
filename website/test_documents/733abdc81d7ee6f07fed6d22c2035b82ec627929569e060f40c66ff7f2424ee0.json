    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency allowed the child to come to the foster home with a\ncell phone in which the location was turned on giving location\ninformation on the foster family and compromising the safety of\nthe child and foster family. Additionally, the child came to the\nhome with a pencil lead in her ear, and the foster care worker did\nnot effectively communicate with the foster parent around the\nfoster child's medical needs in this area or related to the foster\nchild's medical health needs.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 8/15/2025 I interviewed Foster Parent by telephone related to\nthe allegations. Foster Parent reported she had several concerns\nwith agency. She does not understand why the agency is\ninvestigating her and seeking to revoke her license and won’t let\nher transfer to another agency. She reported suspecting the\nreason is retaliation due to her having to sue the agency related to\nback payment issues. She reported it was the agency who did not\ncommunicate well with her; and was not supporting her in the way\nthat they should have been when she had Child A placed with her.\nShe reported Child A was in her care from 6/17/2024 to\n11/20/2024; and she was Child A 's fifth foster care home\nplacement. She reported Child A’s placement with her was her\nfirst experience as a foster parent; and she put her license on hold\nin October 2024 while she was caring for Child A. She said the\nagency is trying to make it seem as if she did not do things, that\nshe did not get medical and mental health care for Child A, but it\nwas the agency’s failure.\nShe said Child A came to her home, with an iPhone in her hand,\nand Foster Care Worker (FCW) failed to ask her whether it was\nokay for Child A to have a phone. All FCW did was ask Child A if\nChild A had gotten permission from her prior caregiver/her half-\nsister to have the phone; and when Child A said, yes, told Foster\n2",
    "Parent it was okay for Child A to have the iPhone because it was\nfrom Child A’s family. Foster Parent said she did not know Child\nA’s iPhone had the location aspect turned on until a week later;\nand by then the iPhone had shown seven prior families her\naddress. Foster Parent acknowledged not knowing if FCW knew\nthe location indicator of the iPhone was turned on. She said FCW\nhad told her the phone was off; that Child A could play games and\nfacetime, as long as, the phone was turned on, but Child A could\nnot make phone calls. Foster Parent reported Child A asked her\nto connect the iPhone to Wi-Fi and when Foster Parent did, Foster\nParent saw it was connected to seven of Child A’s family\nmembers. Foster Parent said she turned the location off on the\niPhone, but every day it would be turned on again by Child A's\nhalf-sister, who had the Apple ID. Foster Parent reported asking\nFCW to come get the iPhone; and FCW told her FCW did not\nhave time to do so. Foster Parent did not give a specific reason\nas to why she didn’t take the phone to the agency or send it to\nthem. She said she took the iPhone to an Apple store, and they\ntold her there was nothing they could do. They advised that she\nturn the iPhone off, which she did. She said she got a government\ncell phone for Child A. She reported returning Child A to the\nagency on 11/29/2024(Child A’s case file showed Child A\nreplacement date as 11/20/2024) and the agency gave Child A’s\nnew family the option as to whether Child A could have a phone,\nunlike what they gave her. She said the agency also alleged she\nwas irate when she came up to the office and complained. She\nsaid she ended up throwing the phone away but did not\ndistinguish if that was the government phone she purchased or\nthe iPhone.\nFoster Parent also reported being upset with FCW for not\nfollowing up on Child A’s medical needs, just like she said FCW\ndid not do about the iPhone issue. She said it’s alleged in a\nspecial evaluation report against her foster home that she took\nChild A for ear surgery without permission; and that she refused\ntake Child A for her mental health treatment, which are untrue.\nShe reported knowing after Child A’s placement date she had 30\ndays to get a medical exam for Child A. She reported she had\nnoticed Child A had prescribed nose drops for some reason, and\nChild A kept picking in her ear. She took Child A to the doctor\nwithin the first week of Child A being with her for an examination\nabout these issues. The doctor told her there was something in\nChild A’s ear. Child A told the doctor that since she did not have a\ncuticle, she stuck a pencil in her ear. The doctor surmised it was\na piece of lead in Child A’s ear; and sent them to specialist, who\nsaid they could not remove the item due to Child A not being able\n3",
    "to sit still. Child A needed to have pencil lead surgically removed.\nFoster Parent said she told FCW about all of this and sent the\npaperwork about Child A needing the surgery to FCW. FCW told\nher, okay; and never told her the agency needed to get parental\nconsent before she could proceed with Child A’s ear procedure.\nFoster Parent reported never hearing anything more about Child\nA’s ear surgical procedure, which occurred on 6/27/2024, until\nabout two weeks after the procedure. Foster Parent changed that\nstatement to say she did not hear more about her proceeding on\nthis matter until August 2025. She received a telephone call from\na children’s services worker, who had FCW on the other end,\nasking her why she hadn’t told FCW about the procedure so that\nFCW could have obtained parental consent. She reported being\nsurprised by that as she had sent the paperwork about it to FCW.\nFoster Parent reported that as a new foster parent she was not\nsure of all things, but she thought she had acted appropriately in\ngetting Child A’s medical care, which occurred outpatient on\n6/27/2024. FCW never instructed her to not follow through, or to\nwait.\nFoster Parent reported in terms of mental health services for Child\nA it was the agency that failed to obtain consent for Child A to get\nthe medication Child A needed for her health. She said she never\nrefused to take Child A for treatment. She said it took about three\nmonths to get Child A’s mental service through community mental\ndue to Child A changing counties. She lived in Washtenaw County\nand Child A previously resided in Wayne County. She got Child A\nin therapy and Child A was seeing Therapist B, from September\n2024 until Child A left her foster home in November 2024 and\nChild did not miss sessions. She reported there came a time that\nChild A was in outpatient psychiatric treatment. The outpatient\npsychiatric treatment came to be, after she had gotten a call from\na lawyer (the specific lawyer was not named) about her and Child\nA testifying in court. She said this was on 10/28/2024 and she\nspoke with Child A about possibly having to testify about things\nthat occurred in Child A’s birth home. She reported on 10/28/2024\nshe learned after the fact, via email from the school, that Child A\nhad gone to school and had kicked someone. Foster Parent said\nwhen she spoke with Child A, that same day, about the incident,\nChild A also said she had taken a pair of scissors and put them to\nher chest to hurt herself. Foster Parent reported she was unable\nto confirm this with the school, due to it being at the end of the\nday, so she tried contacting the agency, and FCW about the\nincident without success. Concerned, she took Child A to Motts\nhospital who told her they could not admit Child A. She said the\nhospital explained to her she could go through community mental\n4",
    "health; and someone could admit Child A for 10 days or she could\ngo outpatient for two weeks. Foster Parent said New Oakland\nFamily Center (NOFC), which was one hour away from her home,\nwas the only one who could take Child A. Foster Parent said she\nchose this outpatient option via NOFC due to her job and Child A’s\nschool situation. She said she called FCW back about these\nservices, but FCW was not helping in getting Child A into\nsomewhere quicker. Foster Parent said she did all she was told to\ndo by the hospital, and Child A was to start outpatient services on\n10/29/2024. She said FCW told her they needed to get parental\nconsent for this service. Birth Mom consented for this service at a\n11/1/2024 court hearing. Child A started out patient services on\n11/4/2024. Foster Parent A reported during Child A’s treatment,\nDr. H wanted to diagnose Child A with Attention Deficit\nHyperattention Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder\nand place her on medication. Foster Parent reported advising\nFCW and FCW said she would contact the parents about\nproviding consent and get back with Foster Parent. She said\nFCW contacted her later and said consensus could not be\nreached for Child A to be placed on psychotropic medication.\nBirth Mom was open to giving consent, but Birth Dad said no.\nFoster Parent reported she thought more could have be done to\nhave the doctor move forward with medication for Child A. She\nasked FCW what more could be done. FCW advised her nothing\nmore could be done without parental consent and to let Child A\nfinish the outpatient treatment for Child A at NOFC. Foster Parent\nsaid she told FCW that since FCW was not doing anything to get\nconsent for Child A’s medication treatment, FCW should transport\nChild A to finish the outpatient treatment. FCW told her FCW\ncould not and told Foster Parent, Foster Parent was refusing to\nfollow through with getting Child A’s treatment. Foster Parent\ndisagreed with FCW’s assessment of the this situation.\nAdditionally, Foster Parent reported FCW was not helpful in\ngetting Child A’s Medicaid changed over. She reported that when\nChild A came to her, Washtenaw County where she lives had\ndiscontinued accepting Molina Medicaid; and she tried to get Child\nA’s plan changed to United Health. She spoke with DHHS\n(Department of Health and Human Services) about this and was\ntold by DHHS they needed FCW to report the request to them\ndirectly; as they also needed specific information about Child A\n(i.e. date of birth, social security number, reason for change)\nverified to them. Foster Parent told FCW this information via\nemail; and FCW reported not being at her desk to give the\ninformation to the DHHS service person. FCW was to follow up\non this later but never did.\n5",
    "On 9/4/2025 I interviewed Program Manager (PM)1 by telephone\nabout the allegations. PM 1 was interviewed because Chief\nAdministrator had reported via email on 8/14/2025 that PM 1 and\nPM 2 were providing supervisory oversight on Child A ‘s and the\nfamily’s case. PM 1 reported he was not providing this supervisory\noversight prior to May 2025. He is the program manager and as\nthe program manager he would not have heard about Child A\narriving at the foster home with a cell phone with a location turned\non; but he recalled vaguely hearing something about that. He\nreported Supervisor who left the agency in May 2025 and over\nsaw Child A’s case would have handled that situation. He reported\nknowing nothing about Child A having a pen or pencil lead in her\near. He reported that if that had been the situation and Child A\nneeded some type of surgical procedure he can’t believe FCW\nwould not have sought consent and worked with Foster Parent on\nChild A’s medical needs. He reported maybe Foster Parent was\nnot aware of what FCW was doing behind the scenes to handle\nthis matter.\nPM 1 reported his only involvement with Child A’s case was\naround getting the IEP (Individual Education Plan) when Child A\nwas in Foster Parent home. He explained the process to Foster\nParent; and that Child A’s parents would need to consent. He\nreported Program Manager (PM)2 would also not have information\nabout these allegations because PM 2 was the agency’s\nsupervisor in then Lansing area prior to her promotion to program\nmanager in January 2025. He reported Foster Parent has\nlitigation going on pertaining to the agency; and staff are not\npermitted to talk to her. He reported there is an agency\nrecommendation for revocation of Foster Parent’s foster home\nlicense, and he suspects this complaint came likely due to that.\nOn 9/4/2025 I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) by\ntelephone about the allegations. She reported being Child A’s\nworker during the time that Child A was placed in Foster Parent’s\nhome. She was assigned to the case in February 2023 with the\nagency until Child A’s case was reassigned to another worker in\nMay 2025. FCW denied the allegations as reported by Foster\nParent. She said she took Child A to Foster Parent’s home for the\nplacement, but she did not see the iPhone or know about it until\nabout one to two weeks after the placement date. She said Foster\nParent contacted her and she advised Foster Parent to turn the\nlocation service off. She also advised Foster Parent that they\ncould meet, and Foster Parent could give her the iPhone; or\nFoster Parent could bring the iPhone to the office. FCW said\n6",
    "Foster Parent wanted to keep the iPhone and change the setting\nso that it could be connected to her family’s plan for Child A. FCW\nreported she agreed to what Foster Parent wanted; and told\nFoster Parent okay, provided Foster Parent turned the tracking\nmechanism on the phone off. FCW reported Foster Parent did not\nexpress concern about the phone again until Child A was being\nreplaced from her home. FCW said Foster Parent was more upset\nthen, when she told Foster Parent that Child A could not take the\nphone Child A had to the new placement. At that time FCW said\nshe did not know whether the phone in question was the same\nphone Child A had come to Foster Parent’s home with, or was a\nnew phone Foster Parent had purchased for Child A. FCW\nreported she was just trying to rectify the issue so that Child A’s\nnew foster parent didn’t feel like Foster Parent had relating to\npossible tracking issues. She tried to explain that to Foster Parent,\nbut Foster Parent was not satisfied with that. FCW denied telling\nFoster Parent she did not have time to come get the phone. FCW\nreported various home visits with Foster Parent after Child A’s\ninitial placement where Foster Parent could have turned over the\niPhone if she did not want to keep it; and Foster Parent did not\nturn over the phone.\nFCW reported as it related to Child A having a pencil lead in her\near that Foster Parent had texted her one week after Child A’s\nplacement about the matter. FCW did not recall the specific date\nbut recalled the text mentioning Child A needing a procedure. She\nreported there being nothing in the text about anesthesia or that\nChild A would need to be put to sleep for the procedure. She\nreported Foster Parent had a habit of sending her multiple texts,\nabout various things, so she did not know that consent was\nneeded for the procedure. She said Foster Parent moved forward\nwith getting the procedure to remove the object from Child A’s ear\nwithout getting parental consent for the procedure; but Foster\nParent didn’t know; and she did not realize consent was required.\nShe said she explained the circumstances to Child A’s parents\nand Birth Mom and Birth Dad were okay with the matter. FCW\nreported there was no special evaluation against Foster Parent\nover this misunderstanding.\nFCW reported there was another matter that came up involving\nparental consent that Foster Parent had concern with and\ncomplained about. Foster Parent wanted Child A to be placed on\npsychotropic medication; and FCW had previously discussed with\nFoster Parent what issues required parental consent. FCW\nreported the matter of medication for Child A came up after a\nreported incident with Child A at school. Reportedly Child A, not\n7",
    "the school, reported to Foster Parent that Child A held scissors to\nher stomach and said she did not want to live. Foster Parent took\nChild A to the children’s psychiatric hospital and the hospital\nrecommended NOFC for services. FCW said parental consent\nwas needed for the NOFC assessment and the agency got\nconsent from the parents, at a court hearing on 11/1/2024 with\nBirth Mom signing the necessary consent; and she submitted the\nconsent paperwork on 11/2/2024. She said Child A had the\nNOFC assessment and it resulted in a recommendation for\npsychotropic medication. She said there was a problem getting\nconsent from Child A’s parents for the medication. FCW reported\nthe agency had also filed an emergency medical petition for the\nmedication issue and there was a hearing. Birth Mom and NOFC\nwere present, and Birth Mom said she would consent. NOFC tried\nto get both parents’ consent, and since Birth Dad said no, NOFC\nwould not take only Birth Mom’s consent to proceed with\nmedication for Child A. FCW reported once Birth Dad would not\nconsent to the medication for Child A, Foster Parent stop taking\nChild A for her outpatient treatment appointment at NOFC. Foster\nParent reported since Child A was not going to get the\npsychotropic medication there was no need, she would not be\ncompleting the two week’s program. FCW reported Foster Parent\nalleged Foster Parent had transportation issues, and when FCW\noffered transportation, Foster Parent told her not to bother. When\nshe went to pick Child A up for an appointment in mid-November\n2024, Foster Parent had sent Child A to school. Foster Parent\nreported she felt Child A did not need to go. Child A was\nterminated from the NOFC outpatient treatment because Child A\nhad apparently missed too many days. FCW reported the special\nevaluation against Foster Parent was related to this matter.\nFCW reported prior to Child A’s placement with Foster Parent,\nChild A was in therapy in Detroit. She reported since Foster\nParent resided in another county, they had to go through\ncommunity mental health (CMH). FCW did not know how long the\nprocess took to get Child A in therapy. She indicated Foster\nParent took care of that. She did not recall Foster Parent asking\nfor her assistance; because if a Foster Parent is able to take care\nof the process, she as the worker, would not get involved unless\nassistance is asked for. She reported Child A got enrolled in\ntherapy and was seeing Therapist B weekly via CMH in\nWashtenaw County. There was no other medical matter Foster\nParent asked her assistance on.\nDocument Review:\nChild A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n8",
    "• Child A was placed in Samaritas’ care on 2/23/2023.\n• She is a temporary court ward.\n• She was placed in Foster Parent’s home from 6/17/2024 to\n11/20/2024.\nMISACWIS Foster home visits’ social work contacts that indicated:\n• On 6/18/2024(a day off the documented MISACWIS\n6/17/2024 placement date for Child A’s placement with\nFoster Parent) a home visit was conducted that FCW\nmoved Child A into the new placement; completed intake\npacket with the new placement.

The petition indicated that Child A needed\nmedication. NOFC had attempted to get consent from birth\nparents and Birth Dad had not consented.\nEmails from Foster Parent with various documents she forwarded\nto staff at Samaritas, and the Division of Child Welfare Licensing\n(DCWL) Director related to concerns she has that Samaritas is\nseeking to take her license and her denial of allegations by the\nagency. The couple of relevant emails related to this complaint\nwere:\n• A copy of a 10/28/2024 text or email she received from\nChild A’s school related to Child A receiving a behavior\nwrite-up. Of Child A having kicked students in school\n9",
    "during lunch this day, and Foster Parent showing she\nforwarded that information to the agency.\n• Copy of a 10/28/2024 University of Michigan statement\nshowing Child A was seen at the hospital and was\nexcused from school until Child A was seen by a\npsychiatric on 10/30/2024.\n• A text from Foster Parent to FCW which indicated she\nexpects Child A’s insurance to be fixed today; and she\nbelieves it’s neglect not to have switched it prior.\n• A text from FCW indicating Child A has insurance and later\nasking whether medication had been recommended for\nChild A.\n• Copy of back-and-forth texts between Foster Parent and\nFCW related to Child A’s outpatient treatment visits. The\ntexts did not show dates. Foster Parent indicated Child A\nhas 4 more visits, that the days Child A attend outpatient\nday care is, Thursday, Friday, Monday and Tuesday\n(9:00am- 3:00PM). That since Birth Dad has refused to\ngive consent for treatment she asked FCW to transport.\nFCW reported she would be able to transport for the next\nday and then that she would transport for the next day and\nthe coming upcoming Monday. Foster Parent reported\nsince no one else could commit for the other two days it\nwould be best for Child A to stay at school. That she had\nalready spoken with the school related to completing Child\nA's IEP.\nCopy of Foster Parent ‘s special evaluation report dated 6/10/2025\nthat showed:\n• A 11/15/2024 intake date; and an allegation of Foster\nParent refusing to take Child A to outpatient treatment\nappointments, and the treatment terminated due to Child A\nmissing too many days.\n• Additionally, allegations of domestic violence between\nFoster Parent and Foster Parent’s Mate.\n• The special evaluation found Foster Parent and Foster\nParent’s Mate in noncompliance of the foster home\nmedical and dental care rule, and foster home evaluation\nrule related to providing accurate and truthful information\non an ongoing basis pertaining to parenting skills and\nstrategies for building healthy relationships with children;\nalong with an additionally findings related to the foster\nhome applicant/licensee/applicant responsibilities of\nallowing access to the home, providing accurate and\ntruthful information on an going basis and the\napplicant’s/licensee’s family history, marriage status and\n10",

The agency must inform the parent or\nparents and foster parent that the information in the parent-agency\ntreatment plan and any other information about the child and the\nchild’s family is confidential.\nViolation Additional Findings of Noncompliance.\nType\n11",
    "Allegation The foster parent and required agency staff did not sign Child A’s\nparent agency treatment plan agreement (PATPA) while Child A\nwas in the foster parent’s care.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 10/20/2025 I had a follow up telephone contact with FCW\nrelated to the PATPA for Child A’s 4/24/2024-7/22/2024 and\n7/23/2024-10/18/2024 USP not being documented in MISACWIS.\nFCW checked the agency’s electronic system and located both\ndocuments and emailed them to me. Neither treatment plan she\nprovided was signed by Foster Parent. Nor were they signed by\nher and her supervisor. She reported Foster Parent must not have\never signed a PATPA.
