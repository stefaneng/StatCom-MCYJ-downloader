    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth are placed at facilities next door to each other. Youth touched the inside of\nanother youth's thigh while fully clothed. No further details are known.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDirector 1, Youth A (female, age 13), Youth B (male, age 13) and Youth C (male,\nage 17) were interviewed at the facility on March 22, 2021.\nDirector 1 said that this incident was reported when the four youth, two from South\nBluff Teaching Family Home and two from Indian River Teaching Family Home,\nwere together at the South Bluff facility. Director said there was video and supplied\nme with a USB drive with video of the time the alleged incident took place.\nThe video shows the staff coming to the doorway of the den, standing in the den,\nand bringing food to the youth. The staff gave medications to one of the youth.\nThe video supplied by the facility had three one-hour segments. The video shows\nYouth C arranging the couches in the den of South Bluff. The den has three wooden\ncouches. Youth C arranged the couches in a U shape and there a bean bag type\nchair in the middle of the U shape. Youth enters the den at 7:31 p.m. according to\nthe date stamp on the video. The three other youth, Youth A, Youth B and Youth D\n(female, age 17) all take positions in the den by 7:35 p.m. The four youth are\nwatching a movie until Youth C reports that Youth A is inappropriately touching\nYouth B and the boys are returned to Indian River. The time stamp on the video\nshow about 8:40 p.m.\nThe staff are seen in the living area in front of the den only on occasion. Former\nStaff 9 enters the den at 7:35 p.m. and leans on the door jam for two minutes. The\ncamera angle is such that I cannot tell if the staff were on the couches outside of the\nden as reported by Direct Care 6. If the staff were sitting on the couches in the living\narea, they would not have had a very good view of the four youth. Three of the youth\nwere laying out on these wooden couches with high sides covered with blankets.\nThe fourth youth was on the floor sitting on a bean bag type piece of furniture also\ncovered with a blanket. Although the video does not show where the staff are\nseated, the angle from outside the den is such that the youth were not being\nsufficiently supervised.\nDirect Care 6 sent an email regarding the incident on March 25, 2021 and was\ninterviewed by telephone on May 04, 2021. She said that she was in the office doing\npaperwork and the other two staff were on the couches watching the four youth\nwatch a movie.",
    "Youth B said that nothing had happened, and Youth C had made a report because\nhe was mad at Youth A because she did not want to be his girlfriend. Youth B said\nthat Youth A touched his knee and not his upper thigh. He said they were in the den\nat South Bluff watching a movie on Saturday. Youth B said that while they were\nwatching a movie the staff were either standing on sitting outside the den.\nYouth A said that the youth from the two programs were watching a movie on\nSaturday night in the den. She said she did not touch Youth B inappropriately. Youth\nA said she had been placed at South Bluff for four months. She said that nothing\nhappened. She said she was mad at Youth C and there was a safety plan that she\ncould not talk to Youth C. She said she said “that gives me butterflies” but she was\nnot talking about Youth B, but about a character in the movie. Youth B said the staff\nwere sitting just outside the den.\nYouth C said that he saw Youth A touch Youth B on the upper thigh on Saturday\nabout 8 p.m. while they were in the den at South Bluff watching a movie. Youth C\nsaid he got up and reported this to Staff 2. He said that the staff there at the time\nsaid it was time to go and they went back to Indian River.\nI received a call back from DHHS Worker 5 on March 25, 2021, who is Youth B’s\nDHHS worker, and she said she had talked with Youth B and developed a safety\nplan even though Youth B told her that nothing happened. She said Youth B told her\nthat he has no interest in Youth A.\nI called Direct Care 6 on March 25, 2021. She said three staff were supervising four\nyouth. The group, two boys from Indian River and two girls from South Bluff, were on\nan outing and then came back and were in the den at South Bluff watching a movie.\nShe said staff were supervising the youth sitting outside the den on the couches that\nare there. She said Youth C reported that Youth A touched Youth B. At that point,\nthe staff took the two boys back to Indian River.\nI called Indian River on May 3, 2021 and spoke with Staff 8. He said that Former\nStaff 9 had left employment at Indian River and Former Staff 9 last day was April 16,\n2021.\nA document titled “Safety Plan for (Youth C) was received via email on March 23,\n2021. It read as follows: Best efforts will be made to keep Youth A and Youth C to\nhave minimal, to no contact with one another. All parties agree that at no time will\nYouth A and Youth C be alone in the presence of one another. These efforts will\ninclude in transportation seating chart, monitoring of youth laptops and that more\nefforts are being made to ensure the houses are not combined for activities in the\nfuture.” This safety plan was signed and dated by Director 1 on March 8, 2021.\nThe reason given for why the two houses (Indian River Teaching Family Home and\nSouth Bluff Teaching Family Home) were combined on March 20, 2021 was that\nthere were only three staff.",
    "I called Direct Care 6 on May 4, 2021. She said she was in the office mostly on\nMarch 20, 2021. The other staff were in the den with the four youth or right outside\nfacing the den. She said that before she came to work the staff had combined the\ntwo houses. She said that she was told later that it was not allowed to combine the\nhouses.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Based on the video recording and interviews, clearly South Bluff\nand Indian River were combined on March 20, 2021, which was\nin violation of the above rule, because there were only three\nstaff for the two CCI programs. Additionally, based on the video,\nthe staff were not closely observing these youth as they laid on\ncouches and a bean bag chair covered with blankets, with the\ncouches positioned in such a way the staff could not observe\nwhat was going on.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nDirector 1 who is responsible for the on-site day to day operation of South Bluff\nTeaching Family Home and Indian River Teaching Family Home signed a safety\nplan which stated the two houses were not to be combined, yet on March 20, 2021\ndue to lack of staff the two Child Caring Institutions were combined.",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4116 Chief administrator; responsibilities.\n(1) An agency shall assign the chief administrator\nresponsibility for the on-site day-to-day operation of the\ninstitution and for ensuring compliance with these rules.\nANALYSIS: Based on the video and interviews South Bluff and Indian River\nwere combined on March 20, 2021, in non-compliance with the\nsafety plan that was signed by Director 1, the chief\nadministrator, on March 8, 2021.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that upon the receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan,\nthere be no change to the licensing status of this private child caring institution.\nMay 11, 2021\n________________________________________\nDon Collier Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 12, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager"
