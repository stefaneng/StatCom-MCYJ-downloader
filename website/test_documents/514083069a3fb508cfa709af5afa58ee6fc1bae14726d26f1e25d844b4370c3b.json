The staff\nmember then tackled a youth to the ground and began to strangle\nthe youth while on top of the youth. The youth has 3-4 scratches\non the front of their neck as a result of the assault.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/24/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker and Law Enforcement\n(LE). Staff 1 reported she picked up Youth A from the\nEmployment Training Program (ETP). Staff 1 reported when they\nwere walking back to the unit, Youth A had a lot of energy, but\nYouth A’s transition from work to the unit is always something they\nhave to manage, so this wasn’t unusual. Staff 1 reported when\nYouth A returned to the unit, she was acting loud and obnoxious\nand talking about events from work, which is not allowed,\ntherefore Staff 1 redirected her. Staff 1 reported Youth A realized\nETP never administered her 5:00pm medication, so she told Staff\n1 they needed to go back to get it. Staff 1 reported she and Staff 2\nwere deciding who was going to go back with Youth A to get the\nmedication when Youth A began to dance inappropriately and\nshake her butt. Staff 1 reported Youth A has proven to be unsafe\nwhen she begins exhibiting such behaviors, therefore Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 determined Youth A was unsafe to take out of the unit.\nStaff 1 reported she explained she was going to take two other\nyouth to grab Youth A’s medications, so they wouldn’t be out of\nratio. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 told Youth A, “you and your hips can\nstay here”. Staff 1 reported Youth A called Staff 2 a “bitch” and\nsaid, “Why do you think you’re always tougher and higher than\nme?”. Staff 1 reported Youth A moved towards Staff 2 and shoved\nher. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 backed away and then Staff 1 noticed\nStaff 2 no longer had her shoes on. Staff 1 reported Youth A was\nstill yelling at Staff 2 and Staff 2 said, “What are you going to do\nabout it? Is that all you’ve got? Do something about it!”. Staff 1\n2",
    "reported Youth A doesn’t react well to such words and phrases\nwhen she is already in a heightened state. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA raised her arm to hit Staff 2 and Staff 2 grabbed Youth A to\nattempt a restraint. Staff 1 reported she intervened and tried to\nhold Youth A’s left arm since Staff 2 was holding Youth A’s right\narm. Staff 1 reported Youth A dropped to the ground, therefore\nStaff 1 disengaged. Staff 1 reported Youth A and Staff 2 continued\nto struggle while Youth A was on the ground. Staff 1 reported\nYouth C and Youth D approached the situation and Staff 1 put her\nbody in between them and Youth A/Staff 2 to block them from\ngetting involved. Staff 1 reported Youth A stood up and Staff 1\nattempted to do a two-person restraint hold with Staff 2, but Staff 2\nwouldn’t allow her to do the two-person restraint hold and wasn’t\nreceptive to Staff 1’s attempts. Staff 1 reported she disengaged\nbecause she felt she was doing more harm than good.\nStaff 1 reported Staff 2 had a hold of Youth A and was fighting\nher. Staff 1 reported Youth A and Staff 2 twisted around, and\nYouth A crashed into a rolling chair. Staff 1 reported she was\ntrying to get Youth D to back away from the situation. Staff 1\nreported when she turned around, Youth A was lying on her back\non the floor and was trying to punch Staff 2 while Staff 2 was\nstanding and hovering over Youth A. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was\ntrying to hold Youth A’s arms to stop her from punching. Staff 1\nreported per protocol, Staff 2 should have disengaged because\nYouth A was on the floor, but she didn’t. Staff 1 reported Staff 2\nthen put her hand around Youth A’s neck and choked her. Staff 1\nreported Youth A kicked Staff 2’s butt numerous times, was\nsobbing ferociously, and Youth A told Staff 2, “Get the fuck off me.\nWhy would you do that?!”. Staff 1 reported Youth D was sitting by\nYouth A’s head, touching her head, and said, “It’s okay. You’re\ngoing to be okay”. Staff 1 reported Staff 3 came in at the end of\nthe situation.\nStaff 1 told Staff 2 to leave, which Staff 2 did, and Staff 2 took\nYouth C, Youth D and Youth F with her so they wouldn’t be out of\nratio. Staff 1 reported Youth A got off the floor and walked down\nthe unit hallway. Staff 1 reported in the hallway outside the unit\nshe heard Youth D yelling at Staff 2 about the situation and all\nthree youth told Staff 2 she handled the situation poorly. Staff 1\nreported she couldn’t hear Staff 2’s response. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A went into the kitchen and began having a panic attack\n(excessively crying, dry heaving, face red). Staff 1 reported Youth\nE tried to calm Youth A down, and once Youth A’s breathing\nstabilized, she came out of the kitchen and Staff 1 was able to\nprocess with her. Staff 1 reported Youth A had 4-5 scratches on\n3",
    "the front of her neck after the incident, and the scratches were not\nthere prior. Staff 1 reported after Youth A took a shower, Staff 1\nnoticed a bruise on her right forearm as well, but Youth A wasn’t\nsure if it was from the incident or not. Staff 1 reported Staff 2\nmade no efforts to verbally de-escalate Youth A throughout the\nincident. Staff 1 reported she’s never seen Staff 2 become\nphysical with any youth.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/24/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker and Law Enforcement\n(LE). Staff 2 reported Youth A returned from work and was happy\nin a manic way (giggling, goofy, laughing), which is typical when\nshe transitions back to the unit. Staff 2 reported Youth A realized\nshe hadn’t taken her 5:00pm medications at work, so she told\nStaff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was going to go with\nYouth A and a few other youth to get Youth A’s medications, but\nYouth A began twerking and dancing. Staff 2 reported she and\nStaff 1 redirected Youth A, but Youth A wasn’t listening. Staff 2\nreported she was sitting down at the head of the table, away from\nwhere Youth A was standing, and Youth A began targeting her.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A began threatening her and cussing at her\nsaying, “I’m going to beat your ass you fucking bitch. That’s why\nyou’re flinching”. Staff 2 reported she stood up at the head of the\ntable when Youth A became escalated. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nthrew a cup at her and then Youth A charged at her (walked fast\nstraight towards her). Staff 2 reported Youth A pushed her and\nthen walked away.\nStaff 2 reported she was wearing sandals, and she had no grip on\nher sandals, therefore after Youth A pushed her, Staff 2 took her\nsandals off. Staff 2 reported she waited until Youth A wasn’t\nlooking before she took her sandals off because she didn’t want to\nappear aggressive. Staff 2 reported after Youth A walked away,\nYouth A turned back around, charged at Staff 2 again and\nattacked her. Staff 2 reported Youth A tried to punch her, so she\ndecided to put Youth A in a restraint. Staff 2 reported she reached\nfor Youth A’s left arm, and Staff 1 tried to hold Youth A’s right arm,\nbut Staff 1 couldn’t keep a firm hold on Youth A. Staff 2 reported\nshe was holding Youth A’s left arm but couldn’t get a hold of Youth\nA’s right arm. Staff 2 reported they were all standing when they\nwere trying to put Youth A in a restraint. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nwas moving and flopping around everywhere. Staff 2 reported\nYouth A fell to the ground and was laying on her back by the\ncouches, therefore Staff 2 reported she loosened up, disengaged\nand put her hands up to show she was no longer restraining Youth\nA. Staff 2 reported Youth A tried to take her down to the floor as\n4",

Staff 2 reported she said, “what are you\nwaiting for?” to Staff 1 in hopes Staff 1 would restrain Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported she never said “what are you waiting for” or\nanything similar towards Youth A, and she would never say\nanything like that to a youth. Staff 2 reported she never tried to hit\nor punch Youth A. Staff 2 reported the only physical act she did to\nYouth A was try to put Youth A in a restraint.

Youth\nA returns to the milieu at 5:54pm with Staff 1. Youth A walks\naround the milieu interacting energetically with her peers. Youth A\ntalks to Staff 1 near the exit door. Staff 2 remains seated at the\ntable. Youth A throws her water bottle down and aggressively\nmotions her hands at Staff 2. Staff 2 stands up and puts her\nphone in her back left pocket. Youth A pushes Staff 2 backwards\nand Staff 2 open handed blocked the contact. They remain talking\nand Youth A points at Staff 2. Staff 2 takes off her sandals and\nstands talking to Youth A with both of them pointing (Youth A\npointing towards the door and Staff 2 pointing at Youth A).
