The message\nindicated that medical personnel were consulted and Resident M was not experiencing\n2",
    "adverse effects of taking the wrong medication. An online complaint was filed with\nDCWL on 1/21/20.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 1/27/20. She has worked at the facility for six weeks and has\nno previous experience working in child caring institutions. Staff 1 works the midnight\nshift and was trained in medication dispensing last month.\nI asked Staff 1 to run through her process of dispensing medication in detail. She said\nshe logs into the medication website and begins with the first child that shows up on the\nscreen. She clicks the child’s picture, pulls the medication out of the drawer and scans\nit as she puts each pill into a cup. She pours water. Depending where the child is\nlocated, she said she either calls him to her or takes the medication to the child.\nOn Sunday 1/19/20 at 8am, Staff 1 recalled her coworker was cooking breakfast for the\nboys when she came out of the medication room with a cup of Resident K’s pills.\nResident M was the next child to receive pills “so he was in my mind.” The residents\nwere cleaning their rooms. Three of them exited their asking for brooms and other\nsupplies. “We couldn’t meet all of their needs at once. I told all the kids to hold on and\nlet me finish. I called Resident M and gave him the meds. Then it clicked in my head\n(those were Resident K’s pills).”\nStaff 1 said she dispensed 3 pills to Resident M in error at 8am. According to the MAR,\nshe gave Depakote 250mg., Intuniv 2 mg. and Risperdal 1 mg. Resident M is actually\nprescribed Tenex (similar to Intuniv) 1 mg. and Seroquel 25mg. Staff 1 said she\nimmediately notified her supervisor of the error and wrote an incident report as directed.\nAdministrator 1 said Supervisor 1 contacted her, Administrator 1 contacted the facility’s\nnurse and the nurse texted the facility’s psychiatrist. Instructions from medical\npersonnel were passed back down the chain to Staff 1 to flush the child’s system with\nwater, assure he takes meals and monitor him for adverse side effects. Staff 1 was\ninstructed to also give Resident M his prescribed dose of Seroquel but to hold the\nTenex.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nANALYSIS: Staff 1 dispensed the wrong medication to Resident M. Staff\n1 noticed her error and immediately sought direction from\nsupervision who contacted medical personnel. Instructions\nwere given and followed. Resident M experienced no known\nadverse effects from taking the wrong medication.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION #2:\nResidents A and M AWOLed from the facility without coats and shoes implying\ninadequate staff supervision.\nINVESTIGATION:\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed collaboratively with Government Worker 1. He has\nworked as the midnight shift supervisor for over 10 years. Supervisor 1 said he was\ncovering Stoner Cottage for a direct care worker who had gone home ill in the early\nhours of Saturday. Resident M woke up at 2am and would not go back to sleep.\nResident S woke at 5-5:30am. “I tried to keep them quiet in their rooms.” Soon, all of\nthe residents were awake. “The cottage was in an uproar.” Three of them were running\naround the cottage, chasing each other and playing.\nBefore daybreak, Residents A, M and S exited the cottage wearing only pajamas. They\nleft without shoes or coats. The weather was rainy with a temperature in the mid-30’s.\n“They stayed out in front of the cottage. I visually kept an eye on them.” When the\ndayshift staff arrived, Supervisor 1 went outdoors and followed the residents on the\npremises. “I caught up with them in the parking lot.” Supervisor 1 managed to convince\nResident S to return to the cottage on his own. The other two boys walked toward the\nwoods. “I could no longer see them, but I could hear them. I followed their tracks to an\nopening in the wire fence. I walked (in the community) yelling for Residents A and M for\n30 minutes.” Then Supervisor 1 said he returned to the campus and directed a staff to\ngo to the police station to file a missing person’s report. “The kids were at the police\nstation when she arrived and she brought them back.”\n4",
    "Resident A, age 6, was interviewed by Government Worker 1. He told her he and two\npeers decided to AWOL and that no staff followed them. Resident A said the boys got\ncandy at the police station.\nResident M, age 8, was interviewed collaboratively with Government Worker 1. He\nsaid Supervisor 1 was working when he and other residents were running around the\ncottage. Three boys left the cottage. It was cold outside. “Resident A took his shoes\noff outside and Resident S had no shoes. Resident S wanted to go back (to the\ncottage). He didn’t go off-grounds. Supervisor 1 came looking for us, but we got away.\nA guy picked us up and took us to the police station.”\nResident S, age 7, was interviewed collaboratively with Government Worker 1. He\nhas cognitive limitations and a speech impediment. Resident S said he and Residents\nA and M went down the street and Supervisor 1 followed them. “Residents A and M\nwalked in the water.” Resident S had no coat or shoes on. Supervisor 1 asked him to\nreturn to the cottage and he did.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: The evidence shows Supervisor 1 was monitoring the residents\nappropriately before they AWOLed from the cottage in the dark\nwithout shoes and coats. Supervisor 1 followed the residents on\nfoot, across and off the campus into the community. He\nsearched for them for 30 minutes. A staff person was sent to\nfile missing person’s reports and found the residents at the\nRedford police station.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION:\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is submitted, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\n5",
