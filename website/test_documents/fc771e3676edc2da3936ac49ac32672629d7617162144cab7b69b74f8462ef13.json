Agency staff were interviewed. Documents were also reviewed.\nWhat follows is information obtained from the aforementioned sources.\n2",
    "On September 16, 2020, a phone call was placed to the complainant and a voice\nmail message left.\nOn September 16, 2020, the agency Chief Administrator was interviewed by\ntelephone. The Chief Administrator stated that she was aware of the problem and\nacknowledged that the agency had failed to complete the required documents prior\nto the finalization of the adoption. The Chief Administrator referred me to the\nProgram Supervisor for additional information.\nOn September 17, 2020, a video conference interview was conducted with the\nagency Program Supervisor. She offered the following information. The adoption\nfinalization for Foster Child A occurred on July 9, 2020. The adoption assistance\nagreement was not signed until July 23, 2020, resulting in the adoptive family not\nbeing eligible for adoption assistance. The Program Supervisor reported that the\nagency worker was new to adoption and had failed to get the required signatures\nprior to finalization. The Program Supervisor reported that the agency was working\nto correct the problem so the adoptive family could receive assistance. The Program\nSupervisor submitted documents for my review.\nOn November 12, 2020, Staff 1, the agency adoption worker, was interviewed. Staff\n1 confirmed that the adoption was finalized on July 9, 2020. Staff 1 reported that she\ndid not obtain the required signatures from the adoption subsidy office until July 23,\n2020, post adoption finalization. Staff 1 reported that after she had received\ninformation from the subsidy office that the adoptive parents were eligible for\nassistance, she thought she then just needed to obtain the adoptive parent\nsignatures and the agreement would be valid. Staff 1 reported that she did not know\nthat the subsidy office needed to sign the agreement after the adoptive parents had\nsigned the agreement. Staff 1 reported that the problem has been resolved and the\nadoptive parents are now receiving subsidy assistance.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nA DHHS – 4113 Adoption Assistance Agreement, was signed by the adoptive\nparents and Staff 1 on July 1, 2020. The document was signed by the subsidy office\non July 23, 2020. The file documents that the adoption was finalized on July 9, 2020.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nAAM 200 ADOPTION ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY AND FUNDING\nSOURCE DETERMINATION\nSigned Agreement: A negotiated DHS-4113, Adoption\nAssistance Agreement, must be signed by the adoptive\nparent(s) and the MDHHS adoption and guardianship\nassistance program manager or designee prior to the final order\nof adoption.\nANALYSIS: The Chief Administrator, Program Supervisor, and Staff 1 all\nacknowledged that the Adoption Assistance Agreement was\nsigned and completed after the finalization of the adoption.\nThe file indicates that the adoption was finalized on July 9, 2020\nand the required agreement was signed and competed on July\n23, 2020, post finalization of the adoption.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV.
