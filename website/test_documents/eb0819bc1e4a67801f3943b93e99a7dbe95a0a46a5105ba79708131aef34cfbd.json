    "Investigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Chief Administrator by phone on 03/04/2025.\nChief Administrator stated Youth A was a recent new case for this\nagency. Chief Administrator stated the agency received\nresponsibility for Youth A 02/20/2025. Chief Administrator\nreported Foster Care Worker 1 is the agency foster care worker\nfor Youth A.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 by phone on 03/04/2025.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported she visited Youth A in Youth A's\ncurrent foster home on 03/03/2025. Foster Care Worker 1\ndescribed Youth A as having cognitive and language\nlimitations/barriers. The parental rights for Youth A's father were\nterminated effective 08/13/2023, and the parental rights for Youth\nA's mother were terminated effective 02/22/2024. Foster Care\nWorker 1 stated Foster Care Worker 1 has not had any contact\nwith Relative since the agency received the case for Youth A. An\nintent to adopt was submitted by the current foster parents in\nDecember 2024. Youth A has expressed a desire to stay in this\nfoster home for adoption, so Foster Care Worker 1 has not been\nactive in pursuing other potential placements.\nI participated in a PCU conference meeting via Teams on\n03/05/2025. Other participants in the meeting were State\nWorker 1, State Worker 2, Program Manager, Chief\nAdministrator, and Foster Care Worker 1. Foster Care Worker\n1 reported that during a foster home visit with Youth A on\n02/27/2025 Youth A reported little memory/relationship with\nRelative or any other relative for placement consideration. Foster\nCare Worker 1 described Youth A as doing well in Youth A's\ncurrent foster home and Youth A expressed a desire to stay in\nYouth A's current foster home.\nI interviewed Relative by phone on 05/07/2025. Relative\nexpressed a concern for Youth A, a possible desire for placement\nof Youth A if appropriate, and an interest in future communication\nwith Youth A. Relative indicated she had participated in a phone\nmeeting on 02/13/2025 with State Worker 1, Foster Care Worker\n2, Program Manager, and State Worker Supervisor. Relative\nstated she felt she was used to getting additional\nhistory/information regarding Youth A, but didn't follow up with\nRelative to keep Relative informed about Youth A. Relative did\nnot mention adoption but did express interest in contact with\nYouth A.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n2",
    "I reviewed the case history/documents in MISACWIS for Youth A.\nThe documentation indicated a long history of family dysfunction\nand out-of-home placements involving Youth A. The parental\nrights of Youth A's father were terminated effective 08/13/2023\nand Youth A's mother 02/22/2024. Youth A has a history of\nmultiple foster home placements. Youth A was placed in Youth\nA's current foster home 10/31/2024. Youth A's current foster\nparents expressed interest in adopting Youth A and signed the\nIntent to Adopt paperwork 12/11/2024. Subsequent service plans\ndescribe Youth A as doing well in this foster home/pre-adoptive\nplacement.\nThis agency received case supervision responsibility for Youth A\nin 02/2025.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with this rule. Youth A has not\nhad a placement change since the time the agency received case\nresponsibility. Youth A’s current placement is a preadoptive home\nwho has signed an intent to adopt. The foster care team has not\npursued any potential change in placement since receiving this\ncase due to the goal of adoption as the adoption team will be\nresponsible to make permanent placement recommendations.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n05/15/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 19, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n3",
