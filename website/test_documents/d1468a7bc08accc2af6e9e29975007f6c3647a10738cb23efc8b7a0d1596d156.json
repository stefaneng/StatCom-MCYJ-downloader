    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code License recommendation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12325\nSection • (1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nDescription appropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained\nin the foster home evaluation and any special evaluations.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency completed a poor assessment on their reopen narrative\nfor a provider. It is unclear if the file was reviewed or if they made\nany sort of assessment of the current compliance since the\nprevious closure was due to an administrative close in response to\nthe previous agency’s recommendation of revocation. The agency\nfailed to indicate that there was a change in the applicant’s home\ndynamics since the closure so there was no central office\nConsultant review to address the previous disciplinary action unit\n(DAU) file.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nLicensing Supervisor was interviewed via video conferencing on\n9/12/2024. She reported being the current supervisor of Licensing\nWorker who completed the license re-opening of Foster Parent;\nhowever, that occurred prior to Licensing Supervisor being\nassigned. Licensing Supervisor reported she met Foster Parent a\ncouple of times and Foster Parent previously had placement of\ntwo teens through the agency, but she is now homeless and in in\nthe middle of a special evaluation. Licensing Supervisor reported\nher understanding is that DAU Manager referred Foster Parent to\nNew Light Child & Family Institute for licensing. Licensing\nSupervisor states she typically reviews an applicant’s prior\nlicensing history before opening a license but did not know if the\nsupervisor assigned at the time, Program Manager, or Licensing\nWorker reviewed Foster Parent’s file prior to re-opening Foster\nParent’s license.\nLicensing Worker was interviewed via video conferencing on\n9/12/2024. She stated Foster Parent talks to DAU Manager a lot\nand DAU Manager referred Foster Parent to New Light Child &\nFamily Institute to have her license re-opened. Licensing Worker\nstated she spoke to DAU Manager who told Licensing Worker to\nopen Foster Parent’s license. Licensing Worker stated this\nconversation took place sometime in April and DAU Manager told\nLicensing Worker there had been no findings in regard to previous\n2",
    "licensing investigations against Foster Parent and there was no\nproblem re-opening Foster Parent’s license following her prior\nadministrative closure. Licensing Worker stated she reviewed\nFoster Parent’s previous licensing file and spoke to Foster Parent\nwho was “very honest.” Foster Parent sent Licensing Worker her\nprior complaint investigations in which she was found in\ncompliance. Licensing Worker stated she would provide email\nexchanges with DAU Manager in which DAU Manager supported\nre-opening Foster Parent’s license; however, she was unable to\nlocate the emails. She also stated she had text messages from\nDAU Manager supporting the re-opening and specifying Foster\nParent should only have one placement at a time; however, she\nno longer had these text messages.\nLicensing Worker stated this is the first license she re-opened\nwithin a year of closure and that she did not know to document her\nreview of the licensing history in the re-opening narrative. She\nstated she did not indicate this as a “change” when re-opening the\nlicense because, even though Foster Parent had moved to a new\naddress, Licensing Worker couldn’t change the address in the\nelectronic file until the license was re-opened.\nLicensing Worker reported Licensing Supervisor is currently\nconducting two special evaluations on Foster Parent based on the\nbehavior of the youths placed in her home. Licensing Worker\nstated Foster Parent moved to an unknown location because she\nfelt unsafe after one of her foster children perpetrated domestic\nviolence.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via video conferencing on\n9/19/2024. She reported having been the licensing supervisor at\nthe time Foster Parent’s license was re-opened. Program\nManager stated she received an email from Licensing Worker\nearlier this year stating Foster Parent had contacted her and\nwanted to re-open her license to take placement of teens after\nwhich an orientation was scheduled. Licensing Worker then\nemailed Program Manager there had been a revocation\nrecommendation made by Foster Parent’s prior licensing agency,\nso the orientation was cancelled. Program Manager spoke to\nLicensing Worker in person and Licensing Worker reported she\nspoke to DAU Manager who said Foster Parent’s license was\nclosed administratively. Licensing Worker told Program Manager\nshe had an email from DAU Manager supporting the re-opening of\nFoster Parent’s license.\n3",
    "Program Manager stated Licensing Worker reviewed Foster\nParent’s prior licensing history in her electronic file; however, this\nwas not documented in the re-open narrative.\nProgram Manager stated the re-open was recommended\nindicating there had been no changes since the license closed,\ndespite Foster Parent having moved as well as there being an\nagency change. Program Manager stated she believed a central\noffice consultant reviewed all re-open recommendations\nregardless if it was indicated there had been a change.\nDAU Manager was interviewed via video conferencing on\n9/23/2024. She reported a revocation recommendation was\nrecommended for Foster Parent’s license late last year. DAU\nManager stated there were significant concerns documented in\nthat agency’s report; however, Foster Parent moved during the\ndisciplinary action process. Historically, if a foster parent moves\nduring the disciplinary process, the license is closed\nadministratively as foster home licenses are issued to a specific\nperson at a specific address; therefore, when a foster parent\nmoves to a different address, the license is invalidated eliminating\nthe need to continue the disciplinary action process. DAU\nManager stated Foster Parent has taken the administrative\nclosure as confirmation DAU Manager did not believe the\nrevocation recommendation was warranted; however, that is not\nthe case. DAU Manager stated she did speak with Licensing\nWorker about Foster Parent in regard to Foster Parent’s licensing\nstill being open in the electronic system, preventing Licensing\nWorker from submitted a re-open recommendation. DAU Manager\nstated she did not offer an opinion to Licensing Worker about\nrecommending re-opening Foster Parent’s license. DAU Manager\nreported she believed if any agency decided to recommend Foster\nParent for re-opening, even after reviewing her file, a central office\nconsultant would review the recommendation and deny the re-\nopening of the license.\nDAU Manager stated she believed Licensing Worker might be\nconfusing two families as DAU Manager did contact her about a\ndifferent foster family asking Licensing Worker to take a look at\nthe family’s record as a potential transfer. DAU Manager stated\nLicensing Worker did and ultimately decided to not accept a\ntransfer for that family. DAU Manager stated she had record of\nthese emails but did not have any emails in which she discussed\nanything related to an opinion regarding the re-opening of Foster\nParent’s license.\n4",
    "DOCUMENT REVIEW\nThe following documents were reviewed in Foster Parents’s\nelectronic record\n- 9/24/2020 Special Evaluation Report completed by\nCatholic Social Services of Washtenaw in which a violation\nof Foster Parent’s care of children based on her physical,\nmental, and emotional health.\n- 5/13/2021 Special Evaluation Report completed by Catholic\nSocial Services of Washtenaw in which thirteen rule\nviolations were established resulting in a revocation\nrecommendation.\n- 4/28/2022 Special Evaluation Report completed by\nMethodist Children’s Home Society in which violations of\nlicensing rules related to Foster Parent’s ability to\nunderstand how to care for children and not having the\nability to provide appropriate care of a child with behavioral\nneeds were established. That agency recommended a\nCorrective Action Plan, and that Foster Parent no longer\ncare for children with severe behavioral needs or with DOC\nlevels.\n- 8/31/2022 Disciplinary Action – Administrative Closure\n- 1/17/2023 Special Evaluation Report completed by Forever\nFamilies recommending a corrective action plan due to\nFoster Parent not informing the agency she is homeless.\n- 10/17/2023 Special Evaluation Report completed by\nForever Families recommending revocation of Foster\nParent’s License due to Foster Parent being found in\nviolation of nine licensing rules. The recommendation was\nbased on Foster Parent’s lack of understanding of how to\ncare for children, putting her own needs first, lacking\nempathy, utilizing control and fear over youths, as well as\nFoster Parent’s history of using manipulation of children\nand professionals and agency/child shopping in an attempt\nto hide her history and manipulate agencies into issuing her\na license.\n- 2/14/2024 Disciplinary Action – Administrative Closure\nletter from DAU Manager stating Foster Parent’s license\nwas being closed despite Forever Families recommending\nrevocation due to Foster Parent moving rendering her\nlicense invalid.\n- 6/10/2024 re-open indicating no change required for\nreopen.\n5",
    "- 6/10/2024 re-open recommending Foster Parent be\nreopened for the care of 4 males ages 11-17 with no\nplacement restrictions.\n- 6/10/2024 Reopen narrative completed by Licensing\nWorker which in part indicates Licensing Worker has no\ndoubt that Foster Parent’s heart is in the right place, and\nshe has the resources to foster again. Neither an\nassessment of Foster Parent’s history nor any indication\nFoster Parent’s history was reviewed is documented.\nDCWL Technical Assistance Manual indicating a re-open\nrequest must be submitted “with changes” if there is a change\nof address. Additionally, the manual states if the agency\ncompleting the reopen is not the original certifying agency the\nnarrative must include and make assessment regarding the\nreview of the applicant’s history.\nEmails from Licensing Worker:\n- 9/12/2024 forwarded email from DAU Manager to\nLicensing Worker indicating there is a technical issue\nwith closing Foster Parent’s previous license\n- 9/24/2024 email stating she was texting DAU Manager\nwhile DAU Manager was on vacation in April during\nwhich DAU Manager mentioned she was okay with\nFoster Parent being opened and only one placement\nwould be appropriate. Licensing Worker wrote she did\nnot have the text messages\nEmail from DAU Manager:\n- 9/24/2024 email stating she remembers speaking with\nLicensing Worker while on vacation, but the conversation\nwas very short and related to the technical issues with\nclosing Foster Parent’s previous license.\nAnalysis The agency is found in violation as the recommendation to re-\nopen Foster Parent’s license was not consistent with the facts\nlocated within Foster Parent’s licensing history. Foster Parent has\nbeen previously licensed through three different agencies two of\nwhich recommended revocation of Foster Parent’s license and\none of which recommended Foster Parent no longer provide care\nfor youths with severe behavioral needs. Foster Parent’s license\nhas been administratively closed twice and has been investigated\ntwo additional times due to moving and not telling her assigned\nagency and/or being homeless. It is documented Foster Parent\nhas a history of moving in order to have her license\nadministratively closed as opposed to being revoked based on\nviolations related to the care of youths. Additionally, once her\n6",
    "license is administratively closed, she approaches a different\nagency to open/re-open her license in an attempt to hide her\nhistory.\nDespite all of these facts, New Light Child & Family Institute\nrecommended the re-opening of Foster Parent’s license for 4\nyouths, with no restrictions.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nOctober 8, 2024\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 9, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
