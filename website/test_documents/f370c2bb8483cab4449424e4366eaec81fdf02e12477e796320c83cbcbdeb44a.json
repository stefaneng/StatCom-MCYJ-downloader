She reported currently there are\nthree case manager supervisors at the facility and she would be\ntaking over is a supervisor that has been promoted to another role\nthat has not transitioned yet.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nJanuary 16, 2024. Supervisor 1 reported that a supervisor\nposition at the facility opened in November 2023 and Staff 1 had\ninterviewed for the role. Due to the previous supervisor\ntransitioning there was some responsibilities that needed to be\ntaken over as soon as possible. Staff 1 was given the opportunity\nto be in this Interim Case Manager Supervisor in December 2023.\nDue to Staff 1’s experience level she was not able to take the role\n2",
    "officially because a variance needed to be approved. As an\nInterim Case Manager Supervisor, Staff 1 does not supervise any\ncase managers or sign off on any reports. Her current role as\nInterim Case Manager Supervisor is as follows: completing file\nreviews, overseeing compliance of the case managers, assisting\nwith onboarding and training new case managers, reviewing case\nsubmissions and providing feedback prior to official supervisor\nsign off, assist the quality team with developing and maintaining\nresources for case management team, attending meetings,\nassisting in audits for clients files, reviewing home visit reports,\nsafety plans and USPS before official supervisor sign off.\nSupervisor stated there are two Case Manager Supervisors\nsupervising the nine case managers at this time and Staff 1 is still\nholds her own caseload of youth.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n- Email dated 01/09/2024 from Supervisor 1 to Licensing\nConsultant- Within this email, Supervisor 1 notified\nLicensing Consultant that they wanted to move forward with\ngetting a variance for Staff 1 to move to the Case Manager\nSupervisor role. Staff 1’s resume attached which noted she\nwas still a case manager.\n- Emailed dated 01/11/2024 from Chief Administrator to\nLicensing Consultant- Within this email, Chief\nAdministrator submitted a variance request to Licensing\nConsultant for an exception for Staff 1 to be a Case\nManager Supervisor due to lack of work experience. This\nemail attached Staff 1’s resume that her current position\nwas Interim Case Manger Supervisor starting in December\n2023.\n- Staff 1’s Resume submitted on 01/11/2024- Staff 1’s\nresume notes she was a case manager for the facility from\n12/2022 to 12/2023. Staff 1’s resume reflects she became\nthe interim case manager supervisor in 12/2023 and is still\ncurrently in that position. Staff 1’s resume shows only one\nyear of experience that would qualify under the social\nservices supervisor requirements per the CCI rules.\n- Variance Request form dated 01/11/2024- This variance\nrequest form was completed and submitted by Chief\nAdministrator dated 01/11/2024. This variance request form\nrequests a variance for the social services supervisor rule\nfor Staff 1.\n- Breakdown of Case Manager Supervisors- Supervisor 1\nshowed this consultant a breakdown of the nine case\nmanagers and their supervisors. Staff 1 reports to\nSupervisor 1 and maintains a caseload. Supervisor 2 has\n3",
    "three case managers reporting to her. Supervisor 3 has five\ncase managers reporting to her.\n- Staff 1’s Human Resource File- Staff 1 has one job\ndescription within her human resource file. This job\ndescription is for the Transitional Foster Care Case\nManager and was signed by Staff 1 on 11/04/2022. This job\ndescription does not allow Staff 1 to have the job\nresponsibilities as it notes for the supervisor role.\n- Youth Reports dated 12/01/23 to 01/16/24- This\nconsultant reviewed all reports that case managers\ncompleted during this time frame to review the signatures.\nThere are no supervisor signatures from Staff 1 within\nthese reports.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with this rule. Staff 1 was found\nto not have the responsibility of supervising staff or signing off on\nreports, which is the responsibility of the social services\nsupervisor.\nTechnical assistance\nIt is recommended the facility does not use the term “Interim Case\nManager Supervisor” as this can lead to confusion of the\nresponsibility of the staff and completing a role where they are\npotentially not qualified to be in. It is suggestion that if a staff is in\ntransition of becoming a supervisor to promote the staff to a lead\nworker while waiting for the final approval or training to become an\nofficial supervisor.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJanuary 31, 2024\n______________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 1, 2024_____\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4",
