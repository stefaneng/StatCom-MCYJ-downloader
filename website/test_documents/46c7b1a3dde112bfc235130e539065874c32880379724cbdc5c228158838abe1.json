    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff allegedly had conversations with youth concerning his\nthreesomes with his wife. The staff asked the youth questions\nabout her body.\nInvestigation I called Complainant 1’s phone number. Unfortunately, there was\nno one there by that name.\nI spoke to Administrator 1 on 8/21/23. Allegations were discussed.\nAll interviews were conducted with DHHS Worker 1 at the\nfacility:\nInterviews conducted on 8/23/23:\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported that Staff 1 sexually harassed her by talking to\nher sexually and showing her pictures of pornography from his\nphone. Youth A reported that Staff 1 talked to her about sex,\nspecifically, how many “body counts” she has. Youth A reported\nthat Staff 1 showed her pictures of himself having “threesomes”\nand random pictures of female behinds. Youth A reported that\nStaff 1 would call the females “hoes” as he showed the pictures on\nhis phone. Youth A reported Staff 1 showed her a video of girls\nhaving sex. Youth A reported she saw these things and had\nconversations with him when they were alone on the unit. Youth A\nreported that she gave this information to Therapist 1, Therapist 2\nand Staff 2. Youth A reported that Staff 4 was present when Staff\n1 allowed her to listen to his phone. Youth A reported that Staff 4\ntold Staff 1 to put his phone away.\nTherapist 2\nTherapist 2 reported she is Youth A’s new therapist since\nTherapist 1 no longer works at the facility. Therapist 2 reported\n2",
    "that on 8/17/23 Youth A disclosed that a male staff was talking to\nher about his sex life with the mother of his child. Therapist 1\nreported Youth A stated he asked her about her “body count” and\nstated they were alone when discussing this. Therapist 1 reported\nYouth A stated that Staff 1 had a threesome and cheated on his\nwife. Therapist 2 reported that Youth A’s behavior has been\nconsistent throughout her stay at the facility.\nSupervisor 1:\nSupervisor 1 reported she is the day shift supervisor and reported\nthat Youth A’s behaviors are the same since she has been placed\nhere. Supervisor 1 reported that Staff 1 does have a phone and\ndoes have it on him due to having a newborn baby. Supervisor 1\nreported that Staff 1 checks on his daughter.\nStaff 4:\nStaff 4 reported that she had not seen Youth A look at Staff 1’s\nphone and has never told Staff 1 to put away his phone.\nInterview conducted on 9/27/23:\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 reported he has never showed pictures to Youth A or\nvideos. Staff 1 reported that some of the girls would start to have\nconversations about older men and he would redirect that\nconversation. Staff 1 reported that he has never been alone with\nany female residents. Staff 1 reported that males are not allowed\nto be alone with female residents. Staff 1 reported he has been on\nhis phone during working hours and acknowledges that the phone\nis a distraction from line of sight.\nI reviewed Staff 1’s work schedule over the month of August\n2023. The following dates he was scheduled to work: 8/7, 8/9,\n8/10, 8/11, 8/12, 8/13, 8/14, 8/16.\nI reviewed all video footage for those dates. There was never a\ntime that Staff 1 was alone with Youth A. On all of those dates,\nStaff 1 was with other staff and other youth. It was observed that\nStaff 1 consistently had his phone out and was using it. Video\nfootage does not show Youth A around Staff 1 when he was\nlooking at his phone or using his phone or holding his phone.\nI reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. Staff 1 has an extensive\nhistory of attendance issues. All trainings and clearances are up to\ndate.\n3",
    "I reviewed the Employee Behavior policy:\nProhibited Behavior:\nPersonal cell phone use is only permitted during scheduled breaks\nand are not allowed while in the presence of clients in any\nresidential program.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to validate the allegations based on\ninterviews and video observation. There is evidence to validate\nStaff 1 consistently using his phone during his shift. Staff 1\nconfirmed he was using his phone and demonstrated an\nunderstanding of why staff are not to use their phone. The\nEmployee Behavior policy prohibits the unauthorized use of\nphones.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n10/16/23\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
