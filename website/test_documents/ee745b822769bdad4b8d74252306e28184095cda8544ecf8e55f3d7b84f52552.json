    "On 2/10/22 a dispositional phone conference was held. with CPS/MIC, JJ staff and\nDCWL.

Staff A failed to appropriately respond to an\nemergency and unusual incident. Although the investigation\nrevealed that there was no malice or intent to harm the youth\nand that the “slaps” were solely intended to assist in awaking\nher, the actions may have been excessive and were not\nconsistent with CPR and emergency response protocol.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\n7",
