    "summary": "A staff member took two youths to a public library. Following a conflict over seating, one youth went to the bathroom. The staff member, believing the youth had left the building, did not search the bathroom and, following a supervisor's instruction, departed with the second youth to return her to the facility, leaving the first youth unattended for 10-15 minutes. The staff member later returned with police and retrieved the youth. The investigation concluded the facility violated its own policies regarding line-of-sight supervision, diligent search for missing youths, and accompaniment to public restrooms. Primary culpability lies with Staff 1 for failing to supervise and search properly, but supervisory and policy communication failures also contributed.",
