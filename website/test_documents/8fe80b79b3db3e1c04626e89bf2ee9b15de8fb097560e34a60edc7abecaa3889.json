    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff responsibilities\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection • (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\nDescription directly responsible for all the following activities:\n• (a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home\ncare. Social service workers shall work directly with\nthe children, their families, and other relevant\nindividuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service\nplans for the children and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster care agency did not provide adequate support upon placing\na youth in a foster home. There were multiple incidents where the\nfoster care worker did not maintain an appropriate line of\ncommunication with the foster parent or communicate needed\ninformation to ensure the youth's mental/medical needs were met\ntimely.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on August 8, 2024.\nThey reported they had no additional information.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FC supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on August 14, 2024. Foster Parent (FP) and the agency\nshe is licensed through is not someone they have worked with in\nthe past. Their care coordinator through West Michigan\nPartnership for Children (WMPC) is part of a foster parent\nFacebook group and is a foster parent herself. She saw FP had\nposted something about her house is open to teens and there was\nsome correspondence after that. FP indicated she was interested\nin hearing more about Youth A and provided her license number\nand licensing agency contact information. A full disclosure\nmeeting was held, and an open conversation took place between\nFP, Licensing Worker, FC Supervisor and Foster Care Worker\n(FCW) that included discussions regarding Youth A’s needs,\nstruggles, where they’re at and where they’re going with things as\nwell as answered any of FP’s questions. At the conclusion of the\nmeeting FP indicated she wanted to move forward with placement\nof Youth A.\n2",
    "Upon placement, services were arranged with Community Mental\nHealth (CMH), this included medication management and an\nenhanced foster care and behavioral specialist that works directly\nwith Youth A. FC Supervisor stated FP received a considerable\nnumber of services and support during the time Youth A was\nplaced there, which was less than one month.\nYouth A had been at Pine Rest for two weeks prior to placement\nwith FP. Upon his discharge, Pine Rest provided FCW with a 30-\nday supply of Youth A’s medications and this was provided to FP.\nAbout 17 or 18 days into placement FP notified FCW that Youth A\nwas out of his medications. FCW stated this couldn’t be accurate\nbecause she was provided a 30-day supply. FCW confirmed the\n30-day supply with Pine Rest when she picked up Youth A but did\nnot count them herself. FP became upset and indicated the\nagency never sent him with enough medication and that is what\ncaused his escalated behavior. FC Supervisor believes FP waited\nmultiple days of Youth A being out of his medication before she\nnotified FCW that he was out. FP had two other teenagers placed\nin her home while Youth A was placed there. There is concern FP\ndid not monitor the medications appropriately and that is why they\nare missing. Additionally, there is suspicion one of the other\nyouths in the home may have taken them.\nFC Supervisor stated he had regular conversations with FCW\nregarding this case. He stated FP was insistent on getting a call\nback immediately after leaving a message and would call or text\nrepeatedly. FP was provided the on-call number more than once\nand then continued to call FCW after hours or on weekends and\nwas upset when she didn’t receive a timely response. She was\nreminded to call the on call number after hours.\nFC Supervisor stated the agency provided much support to FP.\nYouth A is a challenging youth and there much effort and supports\nthat go along with him, therefore it’s frustrating to hear complaints\nabout the agency dumping him without his belongings,\nmedications or supports.\nFP immediately asked for reimbursement for damage Youth A did\nto her home. She sent the agency a list of items he broke that\nneeded to be replaced, but this was a list and a price with no\ndocumentation providing verification of prices. For example, the\nlist contained a reimbursement request for a $150 lamp and FP\nwanted money right away. For the windows that were broken, FC\nSupervisor reached out to the Licensing Agency Supervisor and\nProgram Manager (PM) 7-8 times requesting to meet to discuss if\n3",
    "FIG could assist, but he never heard back from anyone.\nEventually he went to his supervisor and asked her to get involved\ndue to the lack of response.\nFP refused to allow agency to pick up his belongings when he left.\nThe agency finally obtained Youth A’s clothes back, but two pairs\nof expensive Jordan brand shoes were missing.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nAugust 14, 2024. Prior to placement with FP, Youth A was at Pine\nRest. He was placed with FP on 6/27/2024. The agency had a full\ndisclosure meeting with FP where they discussed all of his\nbehaviors and FP knew he was coming from Pine Rest. Upon\npicking him up at Pine Rest to transport to FP’s home, they were\ngiven his medication. He was given a 30-day supply of his\nmedication and this was in the original containers in the pharmacy\nbags which were closed and stapled to the bag. It included a\nprescription chart that specified what he was given that day and\nwhat needs to be given that night. They went directly from Pine\nRest to FP’s home and the medication was not opened or touched\nfrom the time they dropped off Youth A. When FP stated on day\n17 or 18 of the placement, she didn’t have enough medication,\nFCW contacted the social worker at Pine Rest to verify he was\ngiven a 30-day supply, which was confirmed. FP reported to FCW\nshe mixed up Youth A’s prescription with another youth that had\nbeen placed in her home. FCW stated this was confusing and she\ncould not understand how he could be out of his medication this\nearly. FCW stated Youth A had a psychiatric appointment near\nFP’s home on 7/22/2024 to get an updated prescription refill.\nYouth A was on Vyvanse, Melatonin, Abilify and Hydroxyzine. He\nwas short of the Abilify. Youth A reported to FCW that sometimes\nhe needed to remind FP to give it to him and the medications were\nstored in the FP’s bedroom. She stated Youth A is aware of what\nmedications he is taking, the dose, how often he needs to take\nthem and what they do for him. FCW became aware Youth A was\ndown to 5-6 pills, however a day or two later FP reported Youth A\nwas out of his medications. There were concerns because it didn’t\nmake sense based on the amount FP reported he had left and the\namount he takes per day.\nFCW stated she went over the placement paperwork with FP and\nobtained signatures and dates verifying this. Since this was a\nborrowed bed placement, FP also signed a borrowed bed contract\nthe same day. A thorough walk through was also completed. FCW\n4",
    "acknowledged she stated they didn’t plan on staying too long\nbecause they had been traveling since 8am that day and still had\na 3-hour drive home. She stated they reviewed a safety plan with\nYouth A and indicated he advocates well for himself and is aware\nof what his triggers are.\nYouth A received Enhanced Foster Care (EFC) services.\nSomeone from the agency was contacting FP every day or every\nother day to provide support due to his needs. FP reported to the\nagency they were getting on her nerves and calling too much. She\nrefused to allow the behavioral specialist to come to the home to\nwork with Youth A, but reported to the licensing worker the agency\nis not contacting or supporting her. At one point, FP no longer\nwanted EFC services and felt based on her experience and\neducation she could manage without those services.\nFCW had advised that Youth A could display challenging\nbehaviors especially after being told no, but FP didn’t want to hear\nthis. She felt based on her education and experience she could\nmanage him. On 7/18/2024 he destroyed FP house and was\ntaken to a hospital. FP reported Youth A was no longer welcome\nin her home. EFC worker was on her way to pick him up, but FP\nagreed to keep him only after an increase in funds. Upon returning\nto FP’s home, Youth A ran away again and got into an altercation.\nFCW stated Youth A does display negative behaviors, but he\nhistorically will admit to his behaviors and the reasons behind it.\nFCW reported Youth A admitted he pulled a knife on FP, but it\nwas because FP reported to police Youth A was attempting to\nharm himself and this wasn’t true. He said, “bitch I’m going to kill\nyou” and then he dropped the knife. He was then taken back to\nthe hospital and another placement was located.\nFP sent an email that stated he broke two lamps and a phone\ncharger that listed prices but didn’t have estimates or invoices.\nShe stated there were damaged windows that the agency\nrequested an invoice for. FP didn’t return all of Youth A’s shoes\nincluding some expensive ones and Youth A was very upset about\nhis missing shoes. She stated Youth A left with them, but he only\nhad a pair of crocs that he was wearing and nothing else. The\nagency had difficulty getting Youth A’s clothes. She stated they\nwere in FP’s area on 7/22/2024 for Youth A’s psychological\nappointment and FCW texted Licensing Worker indicating she\nwould be in town and asked if she could pick up Youth A’s clothes\nand then meet to get his belongings. Licensing Worker said no,\nand they would need to make an appointment. FP then contacted\nFCW and said Licensing worker stated you were driving by FP\n5",
    "house, and you need to make an appointment and she wasn’t\navailable until 8/3/2024 or 8/5/2024.\nFoster Parent (FP) was interviewed via telephone on August 21,\n2024 via telephone. A follow up discussion took place via\ntelephone on September 6, 2024. FP stated FCW and EFC\nbrought Youth A to her house. Upon arriving, FCW stated they\nwouldn’t be there long. Youth A introduced himself and asked to\nreview his safety plan with FP and identified his triggers. FP stated\nshe will review with FCW and FCW said no that was reviewed with\nYouth A and he knows what triggers him. Youth A wanted to see\nhis room and FP reported FCW didn’t want to see it. Eventually\nshe peeked in but didn’t enter which FP found odd. FP stated EFC\nworker observed it as well. As they were returning downstairs\nFCW said they were getting ready to leave and walked out and\nYouth A ran after her because she left without saying anything to\nhim. As they were leaving, FCW provided the medication to FP.\nThe bag was used and opened with no staple on it. FP stated she\nwasn’t provided a medical passport, placement outline or much\ninformation about Youth A’s behaviors. FP stated she was\nprovided a medical authorization form. She stated she signed\nmany documents but felt rushed by FCW. A few days into\nplacement she inquired about Youth A’s medical appointments.\nShe stated she attempted to reach out several times and FCW\nwasn’t communicating.\nYouth A was being respectful, following instructions and cleaning\nand bathing himself. She noticed there was a difference in the\namount of medication for each bottle. She said FCW indicated she\nwould call the pharmacy and doctor to obtain more. A week later\nhe was out of his medication. FP stated she contacted people at\nher agency and asked if they would reach out to FCW. She\ncontacted EFC as well, but another week went by without\nmedication, and this is when Youth A’s behaviors escalated.\nYouth A lost at a video game and became frustrated and started\nto escalate. He hit her dog with a tablet, swore at FP and kicked\nher in the leg. She texted FCW and stated she needed help and\nYouth A was making self-harming statements.\nFP stated Youth A stole money and a vape from relatives at her\nfather’s birthday party. She said she reported to FCW, and FCW\nsaid Youth A has a history of smoking marijuana and FP asked\nwhy no one had explained that to her previously. Youth A and\nanother youth from the birthday party, blamed each other but she\nsaid it was Youth A. In the same day, Youth A ran away and took\nthree pairs of his shoes and came back with $1. She called Law\n6",
    "Enforcement and the agency on call to let them know Youth A had\nreturned. She also called FCW, but she didn’t answer.\nOn 7/19/2024 Youth A began destroying her property by breaking\nher windows. She called and texted FCW and she was told she\nwas in a meeting. FP asked for her supervisor, and she was told\nby FCW that he was in a meeting as well. She called her licensing\nworker who advised her to call LE and the on-call worker. Youth A\nwas making suicidal statements and locked the door of the room\nhe was in. She stated he broke some of her lamps, her son’s\nheadphones and damaged an Xbox. Law enforcement arrived and\ntook Youth A to the hospital while FP followed. She called FCW\nfrom the hospital and asked for help and said Youth A cannot\ncome back to her home. FCW put her on hold and called the\ncharge nurse and informed her that FP signed a document that\nstates she is required to provide a 14-day notice.\nFP did agree to allow Youth A to return home with her. Upon\nreturning to FP’s home, Youth A jumped out of the car and left the\narea. FP contacted law enforcement and Youth A returned on his\nown. Youth A picked up a brick and broke windows to the FP\nhome. Youth A asked to use the bathroom and threatened to kill\nFP and took a knife and charged towards FP while yelling threats.\nLaw enforcement intercepted and took the knife away and\nsubdued him.\nEnhanced Foster Care worker (EFC worker) was interviewed\nvia telephone on August 28, 2024. EFC worker stated she\naccompanied FCW to pick up Youth A from Pine Rest to transport\nhim to FP’s house on June 27, 2024. Youth A’s medication was in\na plastic bag that was stapled shut and was delivered to FP as is.\nPine Rest confirmed there was a 30-day supply of Youth A’s\nmedication. EFC worker found it concerning regarding the\nmedication because FP’s story changed a few times. FP initially\nreported Youth A was almost out of all his medications and then\nFP said Youth A was completely out of one medication and then\nstated she confused Youth A with another youth that had been\nplaced in her home.\nUpon arriving at FP’s house, they went over intake paperwork and\nprovided Youth A’s medication that was provided by Pine Rest. FP\nprovided a tour of her home and they were able to view the room\nYouth A would be sleeping in and did not have any concerns. EFC\nworker stated she and FCW sat down for quite a while with FP\nand reviewed each document and then obtained signatures when\nneeded. A safety plan was reviewed as well, and Youth A read the\n7",
    "majority of it. He was also knowledgeable about the medication he\ntook and dosage.\nEFC worker stated she communicated with FP regularly to check\nin. She stated FP didn’t usually initiate contact with her. She\nconducted a meeting with FP after placement and it went well but\nafterwards, she stated FP seemed to be annoyed by her\ncommunication attempts.\nVideo Reviewed:\n• FP provided a video she recorded. The date is not\ndisplayed but FP reports the date to be 7/19/2024.

Other than one exchange where FCW\nindicates she and FC supervisor are in a staff meeting, a\nresponse is provided to the inquiries. Some of the contact\nsent from FP to FCW and EFCW is after hours. Contact\nbetween FP and on-call staff was not provided.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance.
