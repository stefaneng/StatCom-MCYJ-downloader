PCP\nreviewed Youth A's medical history and labs which showed high\ncholesterol levels, so NP discussed Youth A making lifestyle\nchanges regarding diet and exercise. PCP reported Youth A was\nseen by her on 6/18/2025 for asthma concerns. PCP reported\nthey didn't discuss all of Youth A's medical needs due to Youth A\nalready having a well-child appointment scheduled for August\n2025. At the June appointment, Youth A's blood pressure was\nslightly elevated which PCP attributed to Youth A being\noverweight for her age. PCP reported they discussed diet and\n6",
    "lifestyle changes and discussed continuing her inhaler.

NP reported she was\ntreating Youth A for back pain and being overweight which she\nattributed the back pain to Youth A being overweight as well as\nbeing large chested. NP reported while she was treating Youth A,\nYouth A was experiencing breast leakage which NP ordered an\nultrasound and lab work to investigate the issue. NP reported she\nordered labs be completed as there are different reasons that\nsomeone can experience leaking/discharge from the breast\nincluding high levels of prolactin, a side effect from medication, a\nresult of being overweight, as well as a medical issue. NP\nreported the lab results showed Youth A had high prolactin levels.\nNP reported normally youth are not put on medications to address\nhigh cholesterol levels and typically this issue is first attempted to\nbe addressed with weight management through diet and exercise\nwhich was why Youth A was referred to Helen DeVos for weight\nmanagement. NP reported there can be a few reasons for why the\nlab results were elevated such as diet being the largest contributor\nfollowed by familial history, and then by medications prescribed.\nNP reported the lab results were being addressed by ruling out the\nbasics first such as diet. NP reported the facility was routinely\nbringing Youth A for appointments and typically Medical\n7",
