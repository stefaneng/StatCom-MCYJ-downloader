However, it was\nnoted that staffing changes and COVID procedures posed some challenges for\nongoing maintenance of the CAP. While there were some repeat violations during\nthis review, most instances of repeats were low. Overall, the majority of cases\nreviewed were thorough and met most requirements.\n10",

Overall, the agency reported strength in many areas, while acknowledging\nwhere improvement is needed over the next year.\nInterviews\nTwo foster care staff were interviewed. One staff has been with the agency for about\nfive years, while the other staff was new within this past year. Both staff reported\nfeeling supported by co-workers, supervisors, and administration. Neither staff had\nany concerns about the agency.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n_ _____________January 28, 2022____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 28, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"
