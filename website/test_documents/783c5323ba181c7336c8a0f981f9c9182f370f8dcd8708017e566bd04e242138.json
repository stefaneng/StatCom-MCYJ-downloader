    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nCatholic Charities West Michigan – Muskegon CB610201023 is relocating from 1095\nThird Street Muskegon, MI 49441-1976 to 1720 Park Street\nMuskegon, MI 49441.\nIII. Methodology\nThe on-site inspection of the new space was completed on June 29, 2021.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe new office is located at 1720 Park Street Muskegon Mi 49441. This is a two-\nstory building that sits on the east side of Park Street with parking on the south and\neast sides of the building. On the main floor is the lobby entrance with separate\nwaiting rooms for families and youth. Also on the first floor are several meeting\nrooms, visitation rooms (with observation rooms attached), a chapel, a storage\nroom, a baby pantry (items for babies), therapy rooms, restrooms and the staff café\narea. Behind the reception desk is a mail room. There is an elevator leading to the\nsecond floor near the back of the building and access to the second floor is\nrestricted by locks on the doors. On the second floor is a large staff training room,\nand several meeting and visitation rooms. The main area used by the Foster Care,\nLicensing and Adoption staff has twenty-six “touch down” workstations and four\ncubicles for administration staff. Some of the “touch down” workstations are at a\nlevel that workers can stand rather than sit. On the south wall of this main area are\nthe offices for the program managers and supervisors. Also, just off this main area\nare a “Lactation room” and several enclave rooms. The secondary area has\nseventeen “touch down” workstations with two administration cubicles. In both areas\nthere are lockers for staff to place their personal items. Off this secondary main area\nis the file room which is locked and secure with a supply room next to it. In the file\nroom are two locked file cabinets that contains the CHRI information. Also located in\nthe file room is the crosscut shredder that the agency purchased last year. Lining\ntwo outer walls in the second space are offices for program managers and\nsupervisors. The second area houses the family preservation programs. There are\nseveral restrooms on the second level along with drinking fountains. Overall, this is a\nnew constructed building and in excellent shape. The building is decorated in a\nwarm and friendly fashion and the visitation rooms are family friendly. This space is\nmore than appropriate for the workings and providing services for this agency.\n2",
