The worker has been joking and laughing at the birth\nmother and saying that it is funny that the birth mother is getting\nupset with her.\nInvestigation Interviews\nComplainant X\nOn 5/2/2023 I interviewed Complainant X by telephone.\nComplainant X reported being a support person to Birth Parent B.\nComplainant X said the allegations are true because the birth\nmother, Birth Parent B reported this negative behavior by Foster\nCare Worker (FCW) 2 to her at least seven times since Child A\nentered care. Complainant X said Birth Parent B contacted\nComplainant X every time Birth Parent B has been with FCW 2 and\ngotten upset. Birth Parent B told Complainant X that FCW 2\nbragged about birth parents getting upset with her all the time. And\nthat FCW 2 thinks that is funny. Complainant X reported Birth Parent\nB told her that on one occasion FCW 2 broke confidentially by\nmentioning a client’s first name. Birth Parent B reported during the\nconversation FCW 2 stated “R” had gotten upset with her, “kind of\nlike you,” Birth Parent B. Birth Parent B also reported that FCW 2\nhas watched her at her home. Further FCW 2 has commented to\nBirth Parent B that Birth Parent B better not be going to do anything\nelse, when FCW 2 observed Birth Parent B go to smoke a cigarette\n(Complainant X did not elaborate on what anything else meant.). The\ninteractions by FCW 2 have taken place at Birth Parent B’s home.\nComplainant X reported Birth Parent B is fighting hard to get her son\nback and FCW 2 seems to be trying to work against Birth Parent B.\nComplainant X admitted she has never met FCW 2 or witnessed the\nunethical behaviors FCW 2 was alleged to have displayed with Birth\nParent B. Nor has Complainant X ever spoken with FCW 2, or heard\nFCW 2 joking, laughing or making fun of Birth Parent B.\nComplainant X reported Birth Parent B’s brother, Person C, ex-\nmother in-law Person D and Child A's birth father, Person E have\nbeen present when FCW 2 has behaved with Birth Parent B in the\nnegative manner as described in this complaint. Complainant X\nreported the only person she has spoken to about her concerns with\nFCW 2 is Chief Administrator 1, whom she thought was FCW 2’s\nsupervisor. Chief Administrator 1 told her other birth parents have\n3",
    "complained about FCW 2. Chief Administrator 1 did not report what\nthose complaints were about. Chief Administrator 1 reported not\nbeing sure what she could do legally about FCW 2’s behaviors, but\nChief Administrator 1 will contact upper administration about the\nmatter.\nChief Administrator 1\nOn 5/4/2023 I spoke with Chief Administrator 1 by telephone about\nthe allegations. Chief Administrator 1 reported speaking with a\nperson who identified herself as a friend and support person to Birth\nParent B; and with Birth Parent B about allegations of FCW 2\nspeaking and behaving unprofessionally with Birth Parent B. Chief\nAdministrator 1 denied telling either of those individuals that there\nwas nothing she could do legally about the allegations.\nChief Administrator 1 reported advising the friend/support person to\nBirth Parent B that Chief Administrator 1 was not sure that a support\nperson has legal standing to file a grievance with the agency on the\ncase. This is usually done by the birth parent, but she will follow up\non the matter. Chief Administrator also advised Birth Parent B she\nwould review the matter; and that she had spoken with the support\nperson/friend. She asked Birth Parent B, what Birth Parent B wanted\nto come from this complaint. Birth Parent B reported wanting another\nworker, which Chief Administrator 1 advised she had to review\neverything about this situation. She also offered to meet with Birth\nParent B. She advised me that Child A’s case is one that permanent\ncustody is pending on; so there may likely be concern coming from\nthe birth parent due to that.\nChief Administrator 1 denied being aware of any other complaints by\nbirth parents pertaining to FCW 2\nBirth Parent B\nOn 5/12/2023 I interviewed Birth Parent B by telephone. Birth Parent\nB reported the allegations are true. I asked Birth Parent B to report\nwhat part of the allegations were true. Birth Parent B reported that\nthree months ago, FCW 2 started acting differently toward her. FCW\n2 started making little negative comments. Birth Parent B was\nunable to give me the specific negative comments FCW 2 made\nagainst her. She reported that after the last court date and FCW 2\nfiling a petition for permanent custody related to Child A, FCW 2 has\nmade several negative comments and FW2 appeared to have been\nwatching her.\nBirth Parent B advised that during a parent/child visitation at her\nhome, FCW 2 mentioned something about another birth parent being\n4",
    "upset with her. Reportedly the birth parent called FCW 2 a “Bitch and\nsaid she hoped FCW 2 gets hit by a car. FCW 2 said the birth\nparent’s first name, that “R” or “RA” “was mad at her, sort of like you”\nreferring to Birth Mother B. FCW 2 did not make another negative\nstatement about Birth Parent B during this conversation. Birth\nParent B reported that sometime later, when a mental health team\nperson dropped off medication for her, she made the statement, “I’m\nnot even mad at FCW 2, I am just upset she thinks I am a bad mom.”\nShe said FCW 2 responded to her by saying “Yeah that’s right”\nwithout even looking up at her. Birth Parent B brought these\nstatements up in her attempt to explain to me how FCW 2 makes\nnegative/unprofessional remarks about her. Birth Parent B reported\nbelieving FCW 2 is being unfair to her by FCW 2 constantly bringing\nup a negative drug screen for her at court, etc. Birth Parent B\nreported this makes “me look really bad”; especially since that was a\nlong time ago.\nBirth Parent B reported her home is across the street/in eyesight of\nthe agency’s office. Agency staff can see her; and they watch her\nhouse. FCW 2 has sent her text messages saying stuff like I see\nyou leaving, where are you going. Birth Parent B stated, “It’s like\nshe’s stalking me”. She said FCW 2 did this five or six times. Birth\nParent B reported this matter to Foster Care Supervisor 3 three\nmonths ago. FSC 3 had Birth Parent B to forward the text\nmessage(s) to FCS 3. Birth Parent B was not sure she still had any\nof the text messages. She was going to check her phone and if so,\nshe would provide them to me. She was not sure what if anything\nwas done by FCS. She denied a meeting with Chief Administrator 1\nabout this complaint, but she spoke with Chief Administrator 1. Chief\nAdministrator 1 telephoned her on 5/2/2023/ the day of the\ncomplaint. Chief Administrator 1 thanked her for the information and\nreported she would conduct an investigation and get back to her.\nBirth Parent B denied Person D or Person E ever being present to\nhear or witnessing FCW 2 making inappropriate comments to her or\nbeing unprofessional as alleged by this complainant. The only\nperson to have witnessed negative behavior by FCW 2 was her\nbrother, Person C. Person C and Person C’s girlfriend were visiting\nthe home while a parent/child had occurred.\nIt is worth stating, that no text message or messages were ever\nreceived from Birth Parent B.\nPerson C\nOn 5/12/2023, I interviewed Person C by telephone. Person C\naffirmed being Birth Parent B’s brother and being present at a\n5",
    "parent/child visit at Birth Parent B’s home. He affirmed some aspect\nof what Birth Parent B reporting related to another parent being\nmentioned. He said FCW 2 had called early one day in the AM to\nreport she would be late because of another parent/child visit she\nwas dealing with. When FCW 2 arrived at Birth Parent B’s home\nFCW 2 said she was late because “R”, (a name Person C said\nprobably should not have been used) was upset with her and hoped\nshe was hit by a car. FCW laughed when she made that statement.\nPerson C did not report FCW 2 telling Birth Parent B she was upset\nlike that parent. He recalled Birth Parent B asking FCW 2 why FCW\n2 kept bringing up to the judge that Birth Parent B had had a positive\ndrug test when that was in the past; and no longer mattered.\nPerson C said he did not know whether FCW 2 called Birth Parent B\nstupid, what the word stupid was used when FCW 2 said “that’s for\nthe judge to decide” if it matters. Person C said Birth Parent B\nbecame upset after that and there was not must communication\nbetween Birth Parent B and FCW 2 thereafter. Person C denied\ndirectly hearing FCW 2 to laugh at Birth Parent B, call Birth Parent B\nstupid or any other negative name, or to yell at her.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)2\nI interviewed FCW 2 by telephone on 5/16/2023. FCW 2 reported\nbeing the case worker on Birth Parent B’s case for a little over one\nyear. She denied the allegations in this complaint; or that any other\nbirth parents had made complaints about her. She reported never\nacting inappropriate with Birth Parent B or any client. She said she\nwould never call Birth Parent B a derogatory name. She advised that\nsince Child A’s goal was change to adoption at a hearing on\n4/14/2023, Birth Parent B has been getting upset with her. FCW 2\nreports it is Birth Parent B who has make comments to her, such as\nwishing FCW 2 does not make it back from a vacation. FCW 2\nreported she has told her clients that other clients have been upset\nwith her also, and that’s okay. She has also explained that other\nclients have threatened bodily harm to her. She reported encourages\nall the birth parents she works with to express their feelings, so they\ncan work things through. She denied ever using one client’s name\nwhen talking with another. She admitted to having a client name\n“R”, but denied reporting the name to Birth Parent B. She advised\nthat “R” was blowing up her phone one day and Birth Parent B may\nhave somehow, inadvertently seen the name.\nFCW 2 admitted there was a time, during a home visit, whereby Birth\nParent B made a comment about it being stupid that FCW 2 must\nkeep talking about drug screens. FCW 2 said during that time, she\ntold Birth Parent B it was not stupid; it was her wanting to Birth\nParent B and Child A to be safe. Also, that it was the judge who\n6",
    "makes the decision about Child A’s permanent custody/Birth Parent\nB’s rights being termination.\nFCW 2 affirmed Birth Parent B’s reporting about where Birth Parent\nB’s home is located in proximity to the Bethany office. They have\njoked that Birth Parent B can see her office; but FCW 2 denied ever\ntracking Birth Parent B. FCW 2 admitted that there was a couple of\ntimes she has driven by Birth Parent B’s home and saw Birth Parent\nB and commented to her via a text message. FCW 2 said once she\nobserved Birth Parent B sitting outside with a group of people and\nshe texted Birth Parent B something like that’s awesome. She\nreported making that comment as an encouragement, because Birth\nParent B is usually by herself; and Birth Parent B being along is a\ntrigger for her mental health. She also text Birth Parent B once when\nshe saw her outside in the cold, but the text messages have not\nbeen negative.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) 3\nOn 5/17/2023 I interviewed FCS 3 by telephone. FCS 3 denied there\nbeing complaints made by other birth parents against FCW 2 about\nFCW 2’s behavior. FCS 3 denied ever observing FCW 2 to behave\ninappropriate or unprofessional in her actions with families. FCW 2\nis friendly with all the clients; and that helps FCW 2 built a rapport.\nFCS # reported Birth Parent B is one who struggles with her own\nmental health and Birth Parent B has made inappropriate statement,\ninclusive of one of hurting herself.\nFCS 3 also advised Birth Parent B’s home is situated in proximity of\nthe agency, whereby they must turn by Birth Parent B’s home to get\nto their office. She admitted that several months ago, around\nChristmas, Birth Parent B spoke with her about a concern Birth\nParent B had related to a text message received from FCW 2 about\nBirth Parent B being outside. The text message said something to\nthe effect of “I see you outside”. Birth Parent B reported wanting to\nfeel safe in her home and to get a text message like that didn’t make\nher feel safe. FCS 3 explained to Birth Parent B that they do not do\nsurveillance on their clients, and she would speak with FCW 2 about\nthe matter. In speaking with FCW 2, FCW 2 reported the text\noccurred during office work hours. FCW 2 said as she was driving\nby the home, she saw Birth Parent B sitting outside; and as it was\nreally cold outside, she texted Birth Parent B something about\nmaybe going inside. FCS 3 sent me that text message. She\nreported a couple of weeks after her interaction with Birth Parent B\non that matter, Birth Parent B was in the office and Birth Parent B\ntold Chief Administrator 1 it was great working with FCW 2.\n7",
    "Document Review\nThe MISACWIS case record for Birth Parent B’ case which showed:\n• Birth Parent B is the birth mother to Child A, a 1 ½ year old\nmale.\n• Child A is a temporary court ward, whose case has been\nunder Bethany Christian Services’ supervision since 4/5/2022.\nA text message dated 1/2/2023, for 2:25PM report from FCW 2 to\nBirth Parent B. The text message read as follows:\n• “Get back inside. It’s cold ya crazies”\n• Birth Parent B responded back with a smiley face and “Yeah it\nis!!\nAnalysis Based on interviews/information obtained related to this special\ninvestigation, there is insufficient evidence to showed that the worker\nnegatively joked about, laughed at or behaved in a derogatory or\nunethical manner with Birth Parent B. Nor that FCW 2 or agency\nstaff did not have the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\nTechnical assistance\nThe agency is advised to caution staff around wording in texts\nmessage to birth parents. The wording “ya crazies” though it may\nnot be belligerent or viewed as inappropriate when communicating\nwith a friend or relative; it may not be received well by a client.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJune 7, 2023\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n8",
