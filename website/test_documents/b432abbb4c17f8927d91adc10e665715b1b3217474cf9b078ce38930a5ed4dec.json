Foster Care supervisor reported that Youth A is currently placed in a licensed\nfoster home. Youth A was placed in licensed foster home on April 21, 2022. Prior to\nthat placement Youth A was in a sibling visit/respite visit with the adoptive parents of\nhis half siblings. The sibling visit/respite visit began on April 11, 2022. Foster Care\nsupervisor stated the agency has faced challenges with maintaining placement for\nYouth A. Foster Care supervisor stated the agency was able to arrange short-term\nplacements with licensed foster homes. Foster care supervisor stated one of the\nshort-term placements (Placement 2) located in Evart, MI ended up keeping Youth A\nfor much longer than originally anticipated. While in that licensed foster home Youth\nA had two incidents at school involving other students whose parents threatened to\npress charges against him. In addition, there was an incident involving an elderly\nneighbor where he broke into her home and stole money. Foster care supervisor\nstated the assigned Foster Care worker (FCW) picked up Youth A on April 1, 2022,\nand brought him to the agency. Foster care supervisor stated the agency was\nsending multiple emails each day and placing phone calls in an attempt to locate a\n2",
    "residential bed for Youth A in addition to trying to locate a temporary placement to\nensure Youth A was not staying in their office. Foster care supervisor stated\nMuskegon DHS assisted and was able to secure a temporary respite placement for\nthe weekend of April 8, 2022, through April 10, 2022. Foster care supervisor stated\nduring respite Youth A had access to a cell phone and was looking up pornography\nwhile in Meijers. Foster care supervisor stated the respite provider dropped Youth A\noff at their agency on Monday, April 11, 2022. Foster care supervisor stated she\ncontacted the adoptive parents of Youth A’s half siblings who she had worked with in\nthe past in an attempt to locate relatives of Youth A. Foster care supervisor reported\nhalf sibling’s adoptive parents had a relationship with Youth A and inquired what was\ngoing on with him. Foster care supervisor stated she advised Youth A was currently\nsitting in their office and the agency was attempting to locate placement. Foster care\nsupervisor stated half sibling’s adoptive mother indicated she planned on contacting\nher husband to determine if it was possible if they could take him. Half sibling’s\nadoptive mother advised she was not sure if their foster home license had closed or\nif it was still open but thought it could be considered a sibling visit/respite visit.\nFoster care supervisor stated they were under the impression that Bethany Christian\nServices Holland (BCS Holland) would contact half sibling’s adoptive parents to\ndiscuss re-opening their foster home license and follow up but that did not happen.\nFoster care supervisor stated BCS Holland did not agree with re-opening the foster\nhome license due to concerns with Youth A’s behavior and concern regarding other\nchildren in the home.\nFoster care supervisor stated the agency discussed contacting the local court to\ninquire about the court ordering Youth A’s placement with half siblings’ adoptive\nparents but there was concern because they would not receive the DOC rate and\ntreatment foster care would not be able to continue. Foster care supervisor stated\nshe and the Chief Administrator participated in meetings with agency upper\nmanagement and it was decided that would be considered a last resort.\nLicensing supervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the agency on April 25, 2022.\nLicensing supervisor stated due to ongoing behaviors in that home, school and\ncommunity the licensed foster parent put in his 2 weeks’ notice to have Youth A\nmoved. Licensing supervisor reported she worked diligently and was able to locate a\nlicensed foster home (Placement 3) that previously had placement of Youth A and\nagreed she would allow Youth A to be placed with her on a short-term basis until a\nresidential bed could be located. Licensing supervisor reported the agency was\ngiven a 2-day notice that Youth A would need to be moved from the home. Licensing\nsupervisor stated the agency faced challenges locating a placement due to Youth\nA’s behaviors and the need for a safety plan that included constant monitoring.\nLicensing Supervisor stated she looked up the status of their foster home license\nand determined it had been closed. Licensing supervisor stated the license had\nbeen through Bethany Christian Services Holland . Licensing supervisor stated the\nagency had been in contact with BCS Holland to coordinate to re-open the foster\nhome license. Licensing supervisor stated if BCS Holland re-opened the foster home\n3",
    "license an addendum would be needed but if Bethany Christian Services Muskegon\n(BCS Muskegon) were to re-open the foster home license a full 3130 would be\nneeded. Licensing supervisor stated they were prepared to do the 3130 but prior to\nthat occurring the half sibling’s adoptive parents contacted them and reported they\nno longer wanted Youth A in their home due to his behaviors. Licensing supervisor\nstated BCS Holland was not willing to re-open the foster home license and then\nimmediately transfer it to BCS Muskegon. Licensing supervisor stated Youth A was\nmoved from the sibling visit/respite visit on April 20, 2022. Licensing supervisor\nstated the agency is facing challenges in locating a residential placement due to\nYouth A’s sexual behaviors, the amount of supervision he needs as well as a lack of\navailable residential beds. Licensing supervisor stated they were under the\nimpression it was acceptable to have Youth A in the placement as long as it did not\nexceed 14 days. Foster care supervisor stated the agency was actively seeking\nalternative placement but ran into roadblocks.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on May 24, 2022. FCW\nstated Youth A displayed challenging behaviors and the agency struggled to\nmaintain placements for him. FCW stated the adoptive parents of Youth A’s half\nsiblings were willing to take Youth A into their home on a temporary basis until a\nresidential placement opened. FCW confirmed Youth A’s previous placement was\nno longer willing to keep him at the time he went to the home of the adoptive parents\nof his half siblings.\nThis consultant had a conversation with Chief Administrator on April 13, 2022. This\nconsultant advised that, according to policy, Youth A is not considered to be a\nrelative of his half siblings’ adoptive parents. As a result, the current placement with\nthe adoptive parents of Youth A’s half siblings is not an approved placement. The\nplacement would need to be court ordered or they would need to re-open the foster\nhome license. A follow up conversation with Chief Administrator took place on April\n20, 2022. Chief Administrator stated the agency did not obtain a court order for\nYouth A to remain in the home of his half siblings’ adoptive parents. In addition, the\nadoptive parents of Youth A’s half siblings were not able to re-open their foster home\nlicense, yet the agency continued placement of Youth A in the home.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n MiSACWIS Case File: Social work contact dated April 11, 2022, at 2:01pm\nFC Supervisor discusses safety plan with adoptive parents of half siblings\nwhile Youth A is in the home. In addition, there was discussion about\nrearranging sleeping arrangements to accommodate Youth A. There is also\ndiscussion about reopening the foster home license.\n MISACWIS Provider record of adoptive parents of half siblings verifying foster\nhome license was closed effective March 8, 2022.\n MiSACWIS Case File regarding placements:\no Placement 1: Youth A placed in licensed foster home from March 1,\n2021-January 5, 2022.\n4",
    "o Placement 2: Youth A placed in licensed foster home January 5, 2022-\nApril 1, 2022.\no Placement 3: Youth A placed licensed foster home April 1, 2022-April\n20, 2022. Note during interviews and conversations with agency, they\nreported Youth A was dropped off at agency by Placement 3 on April\n11 stating he could no longer reside in the home.\no Placement 4: Youth A placed in licensed foster home licensed foster\nhome on April 21, 2022.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12404 Placement.\n(1) An agency shall only place a child with an adult who is\nlegally related to the child, is a legal custodian, or in a\nlicensed foster home, except as permitted in R 400.12709.\nANALYSIS: Agency temporarily placed child with adoptive parents of half\nsiblings who are no longer licensed. Agency considered it to be\na sibling visit/respite visit. However, it could not be considered a\nsibling visit/ respite because Youth A no longer had an intact\nplacement he would return to.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan no change be\nmade to the license status of this child placing agency.\n__________5/31/2022___________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 1, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
