    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 7/8/23 Supervisor 1 allegedly choked Youth J.\nInvestigation DCWL was assigned this investigation reported by Complainant,\nalso the Director, on 8/22/23. Complainant said she heard about it\nsecond-hand from a contractual therapist who heard Youth J\nexpress the allegation in open court.\nYouth J was referred to the facility by the Community\nManagement Organization (CMO).\nI contacted Director requesting video of the incident, documents,\nand staff schedules.\nI collaborated with Government Worker via email.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nOn 8/23/23, I arrived at the facility accompanied by Government\nWorker. I viewed a voluntary safety arrangement authored by\nGovernment Worker and signed by Director agreeing that pending\nthe outcome of the investigation, Supervisor 1 will be shadowed\nby a staff person not involved in this investigation and if he is\nobserved restraining inappropriately or attacking any youth,\nDirector will contact the police, DCWL and Government Worker\nimmediately.\nVideo of Pod 1 dayroom\n17:21:47 – 17:34:11 – Youth J is in the dayroom with five or six\nstaff and four youths. Youth J is verbally and physically\naggressive, darting around shirtless, throwing chairs and a trash\ncan across the room. Staff start removing chairs from the area.\nYouth J picks up another chair, runs toward Youth M and throws it\nat him. Youth M and J start fighting. Staff are verbally\nintervening, separate the two youths and escort Youth M to his\nroom. Youth J walks into an adjoining classroom and several staff\ntry to keep him there to protect others, but they are unsuccessful.\nYouth J returns to the dayroom.\n17:34:12 – 17:35:10 – Supervisor 1 enters the pod. He and Staff\n2 initiate a two-person Primary Restraint Technique (PRT) wall\nhold on Youth J.\n2",
    "17:35:10 – 17:35:12 – Staff 2 releases his hold and Supervisor 1\nuses a one-person PRT to escort Youth J to his room locking the\ndoor behind him.\nI interviewed Youth J jointly with Government Worker. He said he\nwas admitted to Lincoln Center in April 2023, and transferred to\nCalumet Center in May 2023. Youth J was not interested in\ntalking to investigators. He said what happened “is not a problem”\nand admitted he was “acting out, out of control, antagonized, bit a\nstaff and assaulted three people.” Further Youth J insisted “I\ndidn’t get choked. I got put in my room, that’s it.”\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 jointly with Government Worker. He\nhas worked at the facility for five years and been a supervisor for\nfour. Government Worker read the allegation aloud. Supervisor 1\nrecalled the incident that occurred six weeks prior. “I was called to\nCalumet that they needed my assistance. I got there and Youth J\nwas hostile. He gestured. About to swing on me. Staff 2 blocked.\nWe (Supervisor 1 and Staff 2) restricted Youth J’s mobility. I felt\nhis breathing go down. He relaxed. I walked him to his room and\nlocked it. I let him out five minutes later. We talked at his door. I\nallowed him to shower.” Supervisor 1 denied ever choking Youth\nJ.\nSupervisor 1’s personnel file was reviewed. On 3/31/22 he was\nsuspended for two days for improperly restraining a youth, failing\nto document it and failing to ensure the youth was examined by a\nmedical professional.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 jointly with Government Worker. She\nhas worked at the facility for six years, four as a supervisor.\nSupervisor 2 was on the pod when she said Youth J was\n“assaultive and out of control.” “Youth J walked up and pushed\nSupervisor 1. Supervisor 1 and Staff 2 held him until he calmed\ndown. Supervisor 1 escorted him to his room.” Supervisor 2 said\nSupervisor 1 did not mishandle or choke Youth J. On the\ncontrary, she said, they have a good rapport.\nI interviewed Supervisor 3 jointly with Government Worker. She\nhas worked at the facility for four years. Supervisor 3 was present\nwhen she said Youth J was “throwing food and going crazy.” “We\ntried to calm him. Youth J pushed and swung at Supervisor 1.\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 2 held him, then walked him to his room…I\ndidn’t see no one get choked or bit.”\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker. He has\nworked at the facility nearly six years. Government Worker read\nthe allegation aloud. Staff 2 responded “No sir. Youth J wasn’t\nchoked out. He had no trouble breathing and no respiratory\nsituation whatsoever.”\nStaff 2 explained that Supervisor 1 came to the pod to assist and\n“Youth J was full steam.” “He swung on Supervisor 1 and was\naggravated. We held him. He finally complied and went to his\nroom. A few minutes later, Youth J apologized to the pod, me and\nSupervisor 1. He showered and that was it.”\nAnalysis Based on video and interviews of Youth J and staff, there is no\nevidence that Supervisor 1 choked Youth J.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nSeptember 20, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 20, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
