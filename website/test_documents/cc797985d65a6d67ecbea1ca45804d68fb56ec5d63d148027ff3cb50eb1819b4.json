    "two year old” and he charged at her, hit her left shoulder, and\ngrabbed her shirt and began to pull it which was starting to expose\nher breasts so she kept her hands on her shirt and stayed close to\nYouth A while Staff 1 got Youth A’s hands off her shirt and got in-\nbetween them so she could move away from Youth A.
