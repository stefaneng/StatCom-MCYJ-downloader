    "Spoke with Gov’t Worker 1 re: status of investigation; forwarded\nmedication logs\n06/29/2022 Pre-Exit with C1\nALLEGATION #1:\nOn 6/13/22, two youth allegedly engaged in sexual activity in the bathroom at the\nfacility. Afterward, one youth experienced vaginal burning and was diagnosed with\nbacterial vaginitis.\nINVESTIGATION:\nSafehaus Too is a 6-bed therapeutic group home contracted by community mental\nhealth and located in a residential neighborhood in Warren Michigan. The agency works\ndirectly with each youth’s parent/guardian and does not contract with MDHHS.\nThis intake was initially transferred to DCWL from another government agency on\n6/15/22. By the end of the business day, the decision was reconsidered, and it was\nassigned to Government Worker 1. I contacted the complainant. He had no additional\nconcerns.\nI arrived at the facility unannounced on 6/15/22 and met with the Chief Administrator\n(CA). When the incident occurred, CA said there were three youths in the facility and\none staff (Former Staff 1) was providing direct care. CA estimated the inappropriate\ncontact between youths happened between 9 – 11pm after the youths went into their\nrooms for the night but were not asleep. Afterward, Youth D complained of vaginal\nburning and was taken to urgent care on 6/14/22.\nI reviewed the following documents on-site:\n Incident report by Staff 2 dated 6/13/22\n Written statements from Youth’s D, A and S dated 6/14/22\n Room monitoring logs for Youths D and A dated 6/13/22\n Case Management notes for Youths D and A dated 6/14/22.\n Nursing note for Youth D dated 6/14/22\n Former Staff 1’s employee file\n I requested discharge instructions for Youth D’s urgent care visit on 6/14/22, but\nthey were not available. CA said the nurses who transported her did not receive\nany written instructions.\nAn incident report by Staff 2 dated 6/13/22 at 11:47pm indicated:\n“When I arrived at 10:49pm to work (Safehaus Too) I was asking Former Staff 1 about\nhow many residents in the house and their names when I noticed Youth S was\ncomplaining of a stomachache. Youth D was in the bathroom already. Former Staff 1\nwas finishing up her job duties and getting ready to go home. Former Staff 1 informed\n3",
    "me that Youths S and D was both having stomach problems and keep using the\nbathroom. Once Former Staff 1 left I was starting on my paperwork when Youth D\nasked me can she come talk to me about something. I said yes and that’s when Youth\nD started shaking and about to cry, telling me that her stomach wasn’t hurting, but her\nprivate part was burning really bad, and that it was because her and Youth A had snuck\nin the bathroom while Former Staff 1 was busy and had sex. Youth D said it had just\nhappened right before I got there and that’s why she needed medical attention. When\nYouth D told me it was me and her, then when Staff 3 came in, she stated that it\nhappened when staff was busy again. Youth D was moved to Main at 12am and the\nproper calls were made to her mother and Supervisor 1.”\nRoom monitoring logs for Youths D and A showed Former Staff 1 checked the youths\nevery 15 minutes on the quarter hour between 9pm and 11pm and that both youths\nwere awake. Documentation showed the youths were not however checked at variable\nintervals per licensing rule requirements. Additionally, the room monitoring log for Youth\nA showed Staff 2 missed two checks between 11p – 12am.\nCase management notes for Youths D and A verified that both youths’ parents were\nnotified of the incident on 6/13/22.\nThe nursing note by LPN 1 dated 6/14/22 indicated:\n“Patient (Youth D) was taken to urgent care for vaginal irritation. Pt. was diagnosed with\nBacterial Vaginosis and Yeast Infection. She was given a dose of Rocephin ABT\nprophylactic. Urgent care called in a prescription for Doxycycline, Diflucan and Flagyl. Pt\nwas instructed by Urgent care to not take the Doxycycline until STD test results come\nin.” As indicated above, discharge instructions from the urgent care facility were not\navailable.\nA written statement by Youth D, age 15, dated 6/14/22 read “Last night the staff was\nsleep and I ask him to come to the bathroom with me and we had the lights off and\npants down and we did it and I was burning after that.”\nA written statement by Youth A, age 14, dated 6/18/22 (he meant 6/14) read “She asked\nme to do something sexual and I was feel peer pressured so I fingered her.”\nA written statement by Youth S, age 12, dated 6/14/22 read “She told me. I didn’t see it.\nShe said that she made him do it finger her.” A second statement by Youth S dated\n6/15/22 read “She made him go in the bathroom and I walk in on the them and I went\nback in my room, and she told me she was going to tell them and he never touched\nme.”\nI was unable to interview Youths D, A and S as they had all been discharged to their\nparents on 6/14/22. CA said Youth D was discharged because her parents were “very\nupset” when they were notified about what happened and that Youth A wanted to be\ndischarged because of what happened.\n4",
    "I was unable to interview Former Staff 1 because she was terminated for failing to\nprovide continuous adequate supervision to the residents on 6/13/22.\nI interviewed the Human Resources Manager (HRM). HRM said she interviewed Former\nStaff 1 before terminating her. Former Staff 1 reportedly told HRM that when the youths\nwere awake in their rooms, she was sitting in the hall between their rooms with her head\ndown working on electronic files. HRM said based on Youth D and A’s statements that\nthey entered the bathroom together, she determined Former Staff 1 failed to provide\ncontinuous supervision to the residents. I inquired about Former Staff 1’s history of\nwritten discipline. HRM viewed her employee file and indicated that Former Staff 1 had\neight disciplinary write-ups for sleeping on duty during the past six years.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: The written youth statements and findings from HRM are\nevidence that Former Staff 1 was not providing continuous and\nadequate supervision to the youths allowing them to enter the\nbathroom together. Former Staff 1’s employment was\nterminated on 6/14/22.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the\ndirect supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable\ninterval, eye-on checks of residents. The time between the\nvariable interval checks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: On the night of 6/13/22, Former Staff 1 documented 15-minute\nchecks of the youth. However, the checks were performed on\nthe quarter hour and not at variable intervals. Also, Staff 2 failed\nto complete two checks on Youth A between 11pm – 12am.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION #2\nThe same youth was also given a double dose of medication twice during her brief stay\nat the facility.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth D was at Safehaus Too for less than 48 hours. She was admitted the night of\n6/12/22 and discharged on 6/14/22 at 2:10pm.\nI interviewed LPN 1 by phone. She said that Youth D was admitted to the facility with\nher own prescribed medication. Youth D’s medication count sheet was initialed by LPNs\n1 and 2 and listed Escitalopram 5mg and Aripiprazole 5 mg one tablet daily, and\nEscitalopram 10mg one tablet at bedtime. A review of the medication log indicates\nYouth D received one tablet of Escitalopram 5mg on 6/13, one tablet of Escitalopram\n10mg at bedtime on 6/13, and one tablet of Aripiprazole 5mg on 6/13 & 6/14. The\nmedication count sheet was consistent with the medication log. All documents indicated\nYouth D’s medication was properly dispensed and she was not given “double doses.”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written\nhealth service policies and procedures addressing all\nof the following:\n(e) dispensing medication\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: The medication log indicates Youth D received the appropriate\ndoses of her prescribed medication at the appropriate times.\nThere is no evidence she received double doses or that her\nmedication was improperly dispensed.\nCONSULTATION\nI recommended that staff accompanying a youth to an\nemergency medical visit be required by the agency to obtain the\nwritten discharge instructions to ensure that appropriate medical\nfollow up occurs.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nJune 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 6, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n7"

    "summary": "A 2022 investigation at Safehaus Too, a child therapeutic group home, substantiated that on June 13th, two youth engaged in sexual activity in a bathroom while under staff supervision. The facility failed to provide continuous, adequate supervision, with staff performing room checks at fixed intervals instead of variable ones as required. The facility is culpable for inadequate supervision protocols and staff performance, leading to the incident and subsequent youth discharges, while a secondary allegation of improper medication dispensing was not substantiated.",
