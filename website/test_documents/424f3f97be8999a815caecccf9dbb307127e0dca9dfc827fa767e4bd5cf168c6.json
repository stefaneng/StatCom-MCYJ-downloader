IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\nSpecial Investigation #: 2025SIC0000173\nSpecial Investigation Intake Date: December 5, 2024\nLicense #: CB370201248\nLicensee Group Organization: Crisis Center Inc - DBA Listening Ear\nLicensee Designee: Cynthia Seger\nChief Administrator: CAROL EVELYN-FRISKE BANKS\nAgency Name: LISTENING EAR CRISIS CENTER\nAgency Address: 107 E ILLINOIS ST\nMOUNT PLEASANT, MI 48858-2503\nLicense Status: Regular\nLicense Expiration Date: 03/19/2025\nII.

INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Reevaluation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12324\nSection (2) The annual reevaluation must include a determination\nDescription and assessment of all the following:\n1",
    "(a) All changes to the factual information contained\nin the initial evaluation and subsequent renewal\nevaluations.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The foster home address does not match the address identified in\nCWLM and the documentation for a change could not be located.\nInvestigation It was reported the address of the current foster home license is\ndifferent than the previous license address and there was no\nchange in address documentation to change the address.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Foster Parent by phone on 12/5/2024. Foster\nParent stated they have been working with the agency certification\nworker to have the correct address identified on the current foster\nhome license. Foster Parent stated the family had moved from\nthe current license address to the family's current home/location in\n2020. Foster Parent stated the change in residence was reflected\nin documentation for the license renewal in 2020. Foster Parent\nstated the license renewal in 2022 also was consistent with the\ncurrent residence, but some reason the old address was identified\nfor the renewal in 2024.\nI interviewed Certification Worker on 12/5/2024 and 1/29/2025\nby telephone. Certification Worker stated she had been working\nwith central office staff to get the correct address identified on the\ncurrent license that was renewed in 2024. Certification Worker\ndidn't know why the wrong address was identified on the most\nrecent renewal. Certification Worker stated the appropriate\ndocumentation had been completed for the change in address at\nthe time of the renewal in 2020. Certification Worker stated she is\ncontinuing to work with central office and CWLM personnel to get\nthe correct address on the license renewed in 2024.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the CWLM and MISACWIS information systems. This\nreview indicated the address was changed for the 2020 renewal to\nthe current address. This correct address was also identified for\nthe 2022 license renewal. Then the 2024 renewal identified the\nold address that occurred prior to the 2020 address change.\n2",
    "The 3706 was reviewed that changed the address to the current\nresidence.\nThe 3080 was reviewed that assessed the current address for the\ntime of the address relocation.\nThe application was reviewed that was for the change in location\nback in 2020. The application for the most recent 2024 renewal\nwas reviewed, and it identified the correct current address.\nAppropriate renewal evaluation reports and environmental health\ninspections were also reviewed to reflect the current address.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per staff interviews and\ndocuments that were submitted/reviewed. It is evident\nCertification Worker provided the appropriate documentation\nrelated to a change in location at the time the change occurred. It\nappears there is a current system problem or data entry problem\nthat is still in the process of resolution to get the correct address\non the current foster home license.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n02/12/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/25/2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n3"
