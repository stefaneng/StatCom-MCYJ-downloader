    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 10/19/23 Youth B bit a hole in her lip and did not receive timely\nmedical treatment.\nInvestigation I left a voice message for Complainant/School Principal and did\nnot receive a call back.\nI notified Foster Care Worker that I was assigned this\ninvestigation. She expressed no additional concerns regarding\nthe facility.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing rule violations.\nYouth B was discharged from Girlstown before DCWL received\nthis complaint. She currently resides with relatives in Michigan’s\nupper peninsula.\nOn 10/26/23 I interviewed Youth B jointly with Government\nWorker 2 via conference call. After having dental work on\n10/17/23, she said she intentionally bit her lip while it was numb\nand wounded it. Asked why she bit her own lip, she said she\nwanted to see what it was like. Youth B said Supervisor sent her\nout for medical treatment the next day (10/18/23). “The school\nforced them to take me…The doctor gave me antibiotics.”\nI observed two photos of Youth B’s lip taken by Government\nWorker 2 on 10/26/23 (nine days after the initial injury). The\nphotos showed scabbing on the outside of her left lower lip and\ndiscoloring on the inside her lower lip. Unfortunately, no photos\nwere taken the day(s) she bit her lip.\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker 1 via\nphone. She has worked at the facility for four years. Supervisor\nsaid she saw Youth B on 10/17/23 and observed what appeared\nto be a bite mark on her left inner lip. “It did not appear to be\nactively bleeding…No one mentioned going to urgent care. I\nsuggested she ice it and she did.” The next day the school nurse\n2",
    "called Girlstown and asked that staff take her for medical\ntreatment. Supervisor believed Youth B bit her lip a second time\nthe next day at school worsening the original injury.\nI interviewed Social Work Intern jointly with Government Worker\n1. She said Youth B is a “self-harmer” who bit her lip after a\ndental procedure. Social Work Intern took Youth B to urgent care\non 10/18/23 around 1pm. “They said it was already healing, did\nnot need stitches and prescribed an antibiotic.”\nA Girlstown Medical Visit Report completed by urgent care\nphysician dated 10/18/23 indicated Youth B was seen for a\nswollen lip and diagnosed with a lower lip laceration infection.\n“Antibiotics now. If symptoms worsen, go to ER. Schedule follow-\nup with primary care physician.”\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis Supervisor observed Youth B’s injured lip on 10/17/23 and\nsuggested she ice it. She did not feel it required outside medical\ntreatment. The next day the school nurse recommended Youth B\nbe taken to urgent care for her lip. Social Work Intern took the\nyouth to urgent care, and the doctor prescribed antibiotics. After\nintentionally biting and injuring her lip on 10/17/23, Supervisor\nbelieves Youth B bit it a second time worsening its condition.\nThere were no photos of the condition of her lip at the time\nSupervisor observed it and no evidence she required immediate\nmedical treatment after she initially bit it on 10/17/23.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to: (\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a youth\non any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 10/20/23 Youth B attempted to AWOL. Staff 1 threw her to the\nground, and slapped and kicked her causing her nose to bleed.\n3",
    "Investigation VIDEO\nVideo of the living room on 10/20/23 at 4:06pm showed the\nfollowing:\nYouth B enters the living room followed by Staff 1. Staff 1\nappears to be verbally confronting Youth B. There are no other\nyouth or staff in room. Youth B and Staff 1 face one another and\nappear to have a verbal disagreement. Youth B moves toward the\nstairs and Staff 1 shifts her body appearing to block her, then\ngrabs the youth’s waist. Youth B falls to the floor and Staff 1\nappears to fall on top of her. Youth B and Staff 1 go outside of the\ncamera’s view.\nYouth B said prior to the altercation, she was in a “pissy mood\nbecause I didn’t want to be there, and my worker wouldn’t move\nme.” She said she walked to the living room and “Staff 1 was on\nmy ass, saying I was being ‘smart.’ It was only her third day (on\nthe job) and she don’t even know policies. I was doing a puzzle\nand Staff 1 slid it off the table. I went toward the kitchen to make\na phone call and Staff 1 pushed me into the wall. We fell on the\n(living room) stairs and she kicked me in the stomach. She had\nme in a headlock on the ground and was lying on top of me.”\nYouth B said she walked out of the facility and went AWOL.\nAsked if her nose bled, Youth B said it was her lip, which was\nalready injured, that bled.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1. She said\nthe incident occurred during her first week as a direct care worker.\nStaff 1 denied pushing, kicking, slapping, chasing, blocking, or\nrestraining Youth B.\nStaff 1 stated Youth B was on the phone with her worker and was\noverheard saying that if she did not get out of Girlstown,“it would\nnot be pretty”. After the call ended, Staff 1 said Youth B had UNO\ncards and asked for a backpack. Due to her loss of privileges,\nStaff 1 said she was not allowed to have cards, but only allowed to\nread a book. When Staff 1 redirected Youth B, she said the youth\ngot upset and called her a “bitch.” “I asked the other girls to clear\nthe area. Youth B said she’d run right through me. She ran into\nmy midsection with her head. I grabbed her waist and we fell on\nthe floor. She was on top of me. I pushed her off me.” No one\nwitnessed the altercation. “Youth B ran to the stairwell, kicked the\ndoor, and left out the fire exit, setting off the alarm. I called 911\nand then Supervisor.” Staff 1 said her body was sore after Youth\nB assaulted her and she sought medical treatment the following\nday.\n4",
    "Shortly after Youth B went AWOL, Staff 1 noticed she was back at\nthe facility, which surprised and upset Staff 1. She learned the\npolice brought Youth B back and that “Staff 2 let her in.” At that\npoint, Staff 1 said she told Staff 2 that prior to going AWOL, Youth\nB assaulted her in the living area. Staff 2 informed Supervisor via\nphone and Supervisor called the police again. The police returned\nto the facility, took a statement from Staff 1 and transported Youth\nB to the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center for assaulting\nstaff.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis Video shows Staff 1 and Youth B engaged in a verbal\ndisagreement. Staff 1 grabbed the youth’s waist and they fell\ntogether on the living room stairs. It does not show Staff 1 push\nYouth B into the wall, throw her to the floor, kick her or slap her as\nYouth B alleged. It also does not show Youth B assault Staff 1 as\nStaff 1 claimed.\nYouth B told investigators she was not injured as a result of the\nincident. Staff 1 told us she felt sore and sought medical\ntreatment the next day. No other staff or youths witnessed this\nincident. There is no evidence Staff 1 used any type of physical\npunishment toward Youth B.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 violated the facility's policy by failing to write an incident\nreport within 24 hours.\nInvestigation The altercation between Staff 1 and Youth B occurred on\n10/20/23. When I requested the incident report on 10/24/23, it\nhad not been completed. Staff 1 said she was shaken by the\nincident and did not write an incident report until 10/25/23.\n5",
    "I reviewed the agency’s Critical Incident policy which indicates\nincident reports are to be completed by the staff involved within 24\nhours.\nAnalysis Staff 1 did not follow the facility’s Critical Incident Policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to\nSection requirements: staff qualifications.\nDescription (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 engaged in a verbal power struggle with Youth B that led to\nthem falling to the floor.\nInvestigation Staff 1 confronted Youth B after she engaged in prohibited\nactivities based on her Loss of Privilege. Youth B called Staff 1 a\n“bitch” and an argument ensued. Video shows Youth B moving\ntoward the stairs and Staff 1 shifting her body appearing to block\nYouth B. Staff 1 grabbed Youth B at the waist, and they both fell\nto the floor. Staff 1 engaged in a verbal power struggle with Youth\nB while Youth B was escalated. The verbal argument became\nphysical and could have been avoided had Staff 1 backed away\nand utilized verbal de-escalation techniques.\nAnalysis Staff 1 worked at the facility only three days when this incident\noccurred. She lacks the experience to perform the duties of her\nassigned position. Staff 1 needs additional training on utilizing\nverbal de-escalation techniques and physical boundaries when\nyouths are escalated.\nConclusion Violation Established\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nNovember 9, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 13, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
