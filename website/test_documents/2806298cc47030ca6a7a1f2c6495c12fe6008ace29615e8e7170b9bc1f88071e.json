INVESTIGATION\nRule Code &\nMISEP 6.14 Caseload, Foster Care Workers (Commitment\nSection\n60).\nDescription\n(a) (a) 95% of foster care caseworkers shall have a\ncaseload of no more than 15 children.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statue Violation.\nType\nAllegation Agency staff were carrying inappropriate caseload weights.\nInvestigation On 10/3/2022 I reviewed the complaint, which indicated all\nworkers, including newer workers were being forced to carry\ncaseloads of 16-17. The complaint did not identify whether this\nwas foster case or adoption staff.\nI was unable to interview the complainant due to the complainant\nbeing anonymous.\nAdministrator 1:\nChief Administrator 1(here on referred to as Administrator 1) was\ninterviewed by me via telephone of 10/5/2022; and onsite on\n10/12/2022. Administrator 1 reported she is actually the agency’s\nVice President of Child Welfare for the Northern Region. She\nbegan oversight of Ennis-Port Huron on 7/25/2022, due to a\nstaffing shortage.\nAdministrator 1 reported the agency does not have workers out of\ncompliance with caseload sizes. She inquired whether this\ncomplaint was old. She surmised it must have generated from a\ndisgruntle fired staff, and due to the staffing issues, this agency\nhad experienced some months ago. She reported when she took\noversight of this site, two of the site’s foster care supervisors had\nresigned on 6/3/2022 and 6/23/2022; they were down two foster\ncare workers, and the site was without a program director. She\nsaid the new program director (the site’s chief administrator)\nstarted on 10/10/2022, a foster care worker and foster care\nsupervisor were hired on 9/15/2022; and an internal worker was\npromoted to a foster care supervisor position. She denied there\nbeing a time the agency was out of caseload compliance, but\nadmitted the agency is still not fully staffed. She reported the\nagency is down a foster care worker due to a foster care worker’s\npromotion to foster care supervisor. This latter foster care\n2",
    "supervisor (who does not have any staff currently under her\nsupervision) is supervising nine of the agency’s 51 cases.\nAdministrator 1 reported during Ennis- Port Huron’s staffing\nshortage Ennis- Saginaw stepped in and assisted with caseloads.\nEnnis Saginaw had and continues to service 11 of their cases.\nThe remaining cases are split between three foster care workers\n(15, 5, and 14 respectively) and a foster care supervisor who is\ncarrying two cases. Administrator 1 provided a caseload list which\nshowed the break down.\nStaff Interviews:\nI interviewed Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, and Staff 7 onsite on\n10/12/2022. I interviewed Staff 6 by telephone while I was onsite\non 10/12/2022, and I interviewed Staff 8 by telephone on\n10/17/2022.\n• Staff 2 is a foster care supervisor. She reported promotion\nto this position in August of 2022. She is carrying a\ncaseload of nine and is currently not supervising any staff.\nShe reported a caseload of 13 prior to the recent adoption\nof four of the children who were on her caseload. She\ndenied ever having 16 or more cases, or an awareness of\nany of her coworkers having 16 or more cases. Nor was\nshe knowledgeable of a new worker having more than\nthree or five cases.\n• Staff 4, Staff 6, and Staff 8 are foster care workers. They\nreported caseload sizes of 14, 14, and 13 respectively.\n➢ Staff 4 reported employment with the agency since\nJanuary 2022. She reported a progression of cases\nafter several weeks in the child welfare training\ninstitute (CWTI) from three to five. She said she has\nhad a caseload as high as 15.\n➢ Staff 6 reported employment with the agency since\nDecember 2019. She reported there was a brief\nperiod starting in July 2022 that her total caseload\nsize was 16, but two of those cases, which were\npermanent ward cases were assigned to her\nsupervisor. She reported that technically the cases\nwere still assigned to her in MISACWIS, but the\nsupervisor covered them with her assistance. The\ncases were transferred to another worker a couple of\nweeks ago.\n3",
    "➢ Staff 8 is a new foster care worker as of 9/15/2022.\nShe reported getting three cases after the third week\nof her CWTI training and she has 13 cases currently.\n• Staff 3 and Staff 5 are adoption workers; and Staff 7 is a\nlicensing worker. They have been employed with the\nagency two, two and five years respectively. None of these\nstaff reported an awareness of any foster care workers\nhaving to carry 16 plus cases.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• A Caseload list, which showed the caseload breakdown as\ndescribed above. This list also showed Administrator 1 and\nPD XX were supervising staff.\nAnalysis The evidence showed foster worker caseload sizes are currently\nin compliance. There may have been a very brief period of time\nthat one worker had a caseload of 16 due to high staff losses\nbetween July 2022 and September 2022. This was a challenging\ntime for the agency, and it sought the aid and assistance of\npersonnel from its sister agencies during that time; and as\npreviously stated the agency is compliant with this statue.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nRule Code &\nMISEP 6.15 Caseload, Adoption Workers (Commitment\nSection\n61).\nDescription\n(a) 95% of adoption caseworkers shall have a\ncaseload of no more than 15 children.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statue Violation.\nType\nAllegation Agency staff were carrying inappropriate caseload sizes.\nInvestigation On 10/3/2022 I reviewed the complaint, which indicated all\nindicated all workers, including newer workers were being forced\nto carry caseloads of 16-17. The complaint did not identify\nwhether this was foster case or adoption staff.\nI was unable to interview the complainant due to the complainant\nbeing anonymous.\n4",
    "Staff Interviews\nI interviewed Administrator 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, and\nStaff 7 onsite on 10/12/2022. I interviewed Staff 6 by telephone\nwhile I was onsite on 10/12/2022; and I interviewed Staff 8 by\ntelephone on 10/17/2022.\n• Administrator 1 was not aware of any adoption case close\nnoncompliance. She acknowledged that the agency had\nexperienced significant staffing issues between July and\nSeptember of 2022, due to a number of supervisors and\nworkers leaving the agency in addition the agency’s\nprogram director.\n• Staff 3 and Staff 5 are agency adoption workers.\n➢ Staff 3 reported a caseload size of 15 since July\n2022. She reported that prior to the July date she\nhad 13 cases.\n➢ Staff 6 reported a caseload size of 14 but added\nthere was approximately a month where she had 16\ncases after the foster care/adoption supervisor, who\nwas carrying those two cases left the agency.\n• Staff 7 is a licensing worker, and Staff 2, Staff 4, Staff 6,\nand Staff 8 are foster care staff. None of these staff were\naware of adoption workers carrying caseloads as high as\nindicated in the complaint.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• A Caseload list, which showed the caseload breakdown as\ndescribed above. This list also showed Administrator 1 and\nPD XX were supervising staff.\nAnalysis The evidence showed adoption workers’ caseload sizes are\ncurrently in compliance. There may have been a time due to high\nstaff losses that one adoption worker had a caseload of 16. This\nwas a challenging time for the agency, and it sought the aid and\nassistance of personnel from its sister agencies during that time.\nSince that one brief episode the agency’s adoption worker\ncaseload sizes have been and continue to be in compliance.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all of the following activities:\n5",
    "(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statue Violation.\nType\nAllegation Due to agency staff carrying inappropriate foster care caseload\nweights it may have caused late service plans, missed home visits\nand a missed court hearing.\nInvestigation On 10/3/2022 I reviewed the complaint which indicated\nAdministrator 1 was supposed to have attended a court hearing\nfor a supervisor and she missed the hearing causing the judge to\nbe upset. Further information surrounding this allegation was not\nreported in the complaint; and the complainant was anonymous.\nStaff Interviews:\nI interviewed Administrator 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, and\nStaff 7 onsite on 10/12/2022. I interviewed Staff 6 by telephone\nwhile I was onsite on 10/12/2022; and I interviewed Staff 8 by\ntelephone on 10/17/2022.\nNone of the staff interviewed reported there being an issue with\nworkers missing or being late with reports or not completing home\nvisits.\nWith the exception of Administrator 1 and Staff 5, none of the\nother staff persons interviewed reported having direct knowledge\nof a missed court date.\n➢ Administrator 1 reported she was to have attended an\nAugust 2022 court hearing for the foster care supervisor,\nStaff 2. Administrator 1 missed the hearing because she\nhad the incorrect date. She reported no one contacted her\nfrom the court, she was advised by PD XX. She contacted\nthe court and explained the error. She admitted the court\nwas upset, reportedly because a prior worker (who was\nfired from the agency) had missed a prior hearing.\nAdministrator 1 said the court understood and advised not\nto miss another hearing. She reported Staff 2 attended the\nnext hearing and there were no other issues.\n➢ Staff 5 reported Staff 2 was on vacation and Staff 2’s\nsupervisor, Administrator 1 was supposed to attend the\ncourt hearing, but missed it. Staff 5 reported being at the\nhearing as the adoption worker, but she was not sure why\nAdministrator 1 was not present. She said the judge was\n6",
    "upset, but “We worked it out and the hearing got reset”.\nStaff 5 did not advise why she did not call Administrator 1\nrelated to the hearing.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Ennis-Port Huron Organizational Chart as of 10/10/2022\nwhich showed:\n➢ Administrator 1 as the Vice President for the\nNorthern Region; and Administrator ZZ as the\nprogram director.\n➢ Director ZZZ as the director of Ennis- Saginaw\nwhose office is covering 11 of Port- Huron’s cases\n➢ Staff 2 as one of two Foster Care\nManager/Supervisor supervised by Administrator 1.\n➢ The other supervisor as Staff 9 who supervises,\nStaff 4, Staff 6, and Staff 8.\n➢ The Adoption team under Adoption Program\nManager, Staff 10 who supervises Staff 3, Staff 5,\nAdoption Supervisor 11 and one other adoption staff.\n➢ The Licensing/Certification team under Supervisor,\nStaff 12 who supervises, Staff 7 and one other\ncertification worker.\n• MISACWIS case records, for eight of the 45 cases listed on\nthe caseload list provided to me, with respect to service\nplans completion, foster care/caregiver home visits and\nworker supervisor meetings. No areas of noncompliance\nwere observed related to these service standards.\n• An 8/15/2022 11:30am email from Administrator 1 to a\nperson at St. Clair County court that indicated:\n➢ She received information from PD XX that she was\napprised the court needed contact information on her\nwhich she provided in this email.\n➢ Additionally, that she will be in Port Huron on Tuesday and\nWednesday of this week and asking to possibly to see the\njudge on either of those days. Administrator 1 also gave an\nexplanation as to as to how/why the court hearing was\nmissed. That being, that it was on her calendar for\nTuesday instead of Monday.\n➢ She apologized to the court, and advised that if the Ennis\nworker, who was at the hearing had called her, she could\nhave still gotten on for the hearing, but she took\nresponsibility for having the wrong date.\n➢ She advised that she was working on getting Port Huron\nback to standards, as the agency has had many staff who\n7",
    "had left, and she was helping to fill in as director and\nsupervisor until the agency gets fully staffed.\nAnalysis There is insufficient evidence to support the allegations, or that the\nworkers were not working directly with children, their families, and\nother relevant individuals related to the development\nimplementation, and review of service plans for the children and\ntheir families.\nThe missed court date was due to a date error by Administrator 1,\nbut the adoption worker was in attendance. The agency worked\nthe matter out with the court.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nRule Code & MISEP 6.16 Supervisory Oversight (Commitment 66)\nSection\nDescription Supervisors shall meet at least monthly with each assigned\nworker to review the status and progress of each case on\nthe worker's caseload. Supervisors shall review and\napprove each service plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statue Violation.\nType\nAllegation There are concerns at the supervisory level in regard to the level\nof support being offered to staff and clients as needed.\nInvestigation On 10/3/2022 I reviewed the complaint which indicated:\n• Administrator 1 was supposed to be supervising staff, but\nshe would not come to the Port Huron office.\n• Administrator 1 would send other supervisors, who did not\nknow the cases well, and would not help with a crisis.\n• The agency hired a new director who has no training in\nfoster care.\n• This happened between August and September 2022.\n• No further clarification in the complaint.\nThe complainant was anonymous.\nAdministrator 1\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed by me via telephone on\n10/5/2022 and onsite on 10/12/2022. She reported staff always\nhave a supervisor or director in the building. She reported some\nstaff work from home two days a week and are allowed to be in\nthe office three days. She reported when she took over oversight\nof this site, they had a staffing storage. Two foster care\nsupervisors had resigned on 6/3/2022 and 6/23/2022, they were\ndown two foster care workers, and the site was without a program\ndirector. She reported not withstanding that, the workers were\n8",
    "not without adequate and appropriate supervision. She reported\nshe was not always onsite, but Program Director (PD) XX, from\nthe Ennis- Monroe office and PD Y from the Ennis- Howell office\nwere filling in to cover the site and provide supervisory oversight.\nShe reported this is a small site and in addition to PD XX and PD\nY, coming on site to provide any needed staff support a couple of\ntimes per week, there is also an adoption program manager and\nlicensing supervisor onsite daily. Administrator 1 reported the two\nprior mentioned staff have been with the program three and five\nyears respectively, and they, as do, PD XX and PD Y have past\nfoster care experience and are/were able to provide staff support.\nAdministrator 1 denied her or the new chief administrator,\nAdministrator Z not having foster care experience. She provided a\ncopy of her and Administrator Z’s resumes.\nStaff Interviews:\nI interviewed Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, and Staff 7 onsite on\n10/12/2022. I interviewed Staff 6 by telephone while I was onsite\non 10/12/2022; and I interviewed Staff 8 by telephone on\n10/17/2022.\nAll of the above-named staff interviewed affirmed Administrator 1’s\nreporting related to PD XX, and PD Y coming to the agency\nseveral times a week to ensure for daily supervisory coverage. A\ncouple of these staff also reported another supervisory staff,\nAdministrator ZZ would also fill in; and that Staff 10 the Adoption\nProgram was onsite and would provide supervision. They\nindicated PD XX was onsite on Monday and Wednesday; PD Y on\nTuesday and Thursdays and Administrator 1 on Friday.\nWith the exception of Staff 4 and Staff 5 all other staff persons\ninterviewed reported feeling supported, not having a problem\nobtaining supervision or obtaining assistance related to cases or\nother foster care or adoption service needs.\n• Staff 4 reported feeling supported and well supervised now.\nShe reported prior to her new supervisor she did feel she\nwas getting all that she needed from PD XX during the time\nPD XX was temporarily assigned to supervise her. She\nalso felt she was not given enough assistance when she\nhad to go to a shelter to deal with a youth who had been\ndisruptive. She acknowledged that PD XX and another\nsupervisor did come to the shelter to relieve her. Staff 4 did\nnot report there being a time that she was not provided at\nleast monthly supervision.\n• Staff 5 denied there being a time she personally felt\nunsupported or was without needed or required\n9",
    "supervision. She reported knowing that Staff 4 had felt\nunsupported. Staff 5 said as an adoption worker she\nshared some cases with Staff 4 and Staff 4 had expressed\nconcerns in this area due to some difficult cases. Staff 5\nreported she offered assistance and help to Staff 4. Staff 5\nexpressed optimism that all will be better now that they\nhave a supervisor directly for the Port Huron site.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• MISACWIS case records, for eight of the 45 cases listed on\nthe caseload list provided to me, with respect to monthly\nworker/supervisor supervision meetings. No areas of\nnoncompliance were observed related in this standard.\n• A copy of a resume for Administrator 1, which showed she\nhas past experience as a foster care worker, supervised\nindependent living worker, program coordinator and child\nwelfare program director.\n• A copy of a resume for Administrator Z, which showed she\nhas past experience as a family’s first counselor, foster\ncare worker, adoption resource consultant, and licensing\nworker.\nAnalysis There is insufficient evidence to support the allegation as\nindicated in the complaint or to show a lack of supervisory\noversight.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the agency’s current licensing status is recommended.\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date March 1, 2023\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 12, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n10"
