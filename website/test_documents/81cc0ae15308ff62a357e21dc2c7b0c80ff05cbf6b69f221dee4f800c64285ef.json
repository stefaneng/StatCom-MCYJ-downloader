EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with the individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan in response to the renewal\ninspection completed on 5/11/23 with the corrective action plan approved on\n5/11/2023.

The agency continues to struggle in the area of\npolicy 722-08D as there is a repeat violation during this reporting period for this\npolicy.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was discussed onsite 03/12/2024. The Chief\nAdministrator (CA) reported the agency has not had any staff turnover since the\n3",
    "last audit review and has hired two foster care managers. The biggest challenge\nis providing extra support to the newly hired staff by the supervisors. The CA\nreported the agency has accepted 25 new cases since the last audit review and\nalmost all are relative caregivers who need extra support in order to maintain\nplacement. The CA reported the staff have been working diligently to maintain\nrelative placements and sometimes this takes precedence over data entry. The\nCA reported overall, the corrective action plan submitted for the last audit\ninspection has had a positive impact on the agency’s compliance as the trainings\nand procedures that were put in place have proven to be beneficial to the agency.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a copy of their audit completed by an independent certified\naccountant dated 12/31/2022 and presented to the agency on 5/22/2023. The\nagency also presented their annual budget. No concerns were noted.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff onsite. Staff reported feeling supported\nby their supervisors, coworkers, and the administration. They all reported the\nwork environment is very positive, and they have no concerns. The only change\nthe staff reported was to be able to regulate the heat in the building.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to perform required\njob duties. Files are stored securely and in a manner that provides unauthorized\naccess.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nSafety Alert: The home has an in-ground spa that does not have a locked safety\ncover.\nResolution: A special evaluation #2024C0001343SE was opened regarding\nR400.9301(5). A variance will be requested to allow the foster parent to maintain the\ncurrent cover while the spa is empty, as it is now. The current cover is very heavy\nand requires a contractor to install and remove it. The foster parent also has motion-\nactivated alarms on all exterior doors and rescue equipment near the spa. The foster\nparent will be required to obtain a cover with a lock to meet the licensing rule before\nhaving the current cover removed and filling the spa with water. No children will be\nplaced in the home until the variance is approved or the foster parent is in\ncompliance with the licensing rule.\n4",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n4/25/2024\n_________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/26/2024\n_________________________________________________________________\nSamanatha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
