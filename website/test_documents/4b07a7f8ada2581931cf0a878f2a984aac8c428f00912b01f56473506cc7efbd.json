Youth A\nhas complained about being at the facility, has mental health\nissues and other youths have threatened her.\nInvestigation Interviews:\n2",
    "On 4/18/2024, I interviewed the Emergency Medical Technician\n(EMT) by telephone. The EMT reported she did not know or\nreport anything about mental health issues, a safety plan or\nsuicidal behavior for Youth A. The EMT reported she was\nconcerned for Youth A’s safety, due to Youth A alleging another\nyouth at the facility had a knife, verbal threats a youth made while\nthe EMT was on the facility’s site about beating Youth A’s “ass”;\nand how the staff onsite had behaved. The staff had not given her\nnames and reported not being able to intervene if Youth A was\nattacked. The investigation related to these EMT concerns are\ndiscussed in another allegation section of this report.\nOn 4/22/2024 I interviewed the Program Director (PD) by\ntelephone. Additionally, I spoke with her during my onsite facility\nvisit on 4/25/2024, and a follow-up telephone call on 5/21/2024.\nThe PD reported Youth A does have on going mental health\nconcerns; and Youth A receives weekly therapy through the\nagency’s Therapist. The PD reported Youth A was placed in\nHoly’s Cross’ Independent Living (IL) program because Youth A\nmet the agency’s criteria for placement. She reported they have\na team process for intake that includes, the agency’s foster care\nworker, house manager, and supervisor all sitting in on a youth’s\ninterview for placement. They look at the youth’s behavior, mental\nhealth diagnoses needs, and length of time since a youth’s last\nepisodes. They accept youths with mental health diagnoses, past\nself-harming behavior, those on psychotic medications and/or with\npast mental health hospitalizations. They use a three-tier eligibility\nscaling system to aid them in admission determination; and make\ntheir decisions case by case, based on the youth, all the\ninformation available and services that can be provided to the\nyouth. The PD acknowledged Youth A has had some peer\ninteraction struggles which is a part off her past history, along with\nself-harming and/or cutting behavior.\nOn 4/24/2024 I interviewed Youth A’s Therapist related to the\nallegations by telephone. I had a follow up contact with the\nTherapist via telephone on 5/22/2024. The Therapist reported\nthe agency determined as a team that Youth A was appropriate\nfor the agency’s IL program. He reported the appropriateness of\nYouth A for the program was determined by way of review of\nYouth A’s referral, and past documented history. He reported\nthere was nothing seen in Youth A’s history that caused her not to\nbe accepted for placement. He reported Youth A has been in the\nprogram for about six months now, and although Youth A has had\nissues with her peers, is not always sincere in her statements; and\nstruggles to follow her treatment plan, this placement remains an\n3",
    "appropriate one for her. He reported meeting with Youth A weekly\nfor therapy. He reported if this placement was not appropriate they\nwould request Youth A’s replacement.\nThe Therapist reported he has completed three safety plans with\nYouth A around her behaviors. The last one was on 4/18/2024\naround physical aggression with peers. Two others were\ncompleted on 3/22/2024, and 2/15/2024 for risky behavior on her\ncell phone, and electronic media; related to engaging in\npornography/ inappropriate social media posting of her photos,\nrespectively. He reported if any self-harming or cutting had been\nknown or reported to him, he would have safety planned with\nYouth A around that behavior. He would have also completed a\nsuicide assessment and determine if resources were needed.\nOn 4/25/2024 I interviewed the House Manager onsite at the IL\nhome. The House Manager reported Youth A interviewed well at\nintake. She concurred with the PD and Therapist that Youth A met\ncriteria for the program. She confirmed other staff persons’\nreporting of Youth A having some inappropriate behaviors around\ncell phone use and peer interaction. She indicated a current issue\nof trying to get Youth A to commit to taking her medications; but\nshe does not feel Youth A is a danger to herself. She reported,\nYouth A likes to play games and instigates social problems.\nOn 5/6/2024 I interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Worker (FCW)\nby telephone. I had a follow-up telephone interview with her on\n5/25/2024. The FCW reported assignment to Youth A’s case when\nthe youth was placed at the agency’s IL home. The FCW advised\nYouth A was accepted into the program in February 2024; and the\nfinal decision for a youth ‘s placement into the program is by the\nadministrator. The FCW reported any concerns she has around\nYouth A’s mental health has centered on Youth A’s need for more\nstructure due to the youth’s lack of maturity; and Youth A’s\nrefusals to take her medication; and to go to medical\nappointments. The latter of which the FCW reported they continue\nto address with Youth A; and have been discussing with the\ndepartment via family team meetings (FTM).\nOn 4/25/2024 I interviewed Youth A onsite at the IL home. She\nreported being in this IL program since February 2024. She\nreported the program is meeting her needs, and that she feels\nsafe here. She reported there is no other place for her to go, but\nthat does not matter because in two months, when she turns 18,\nshe is leaving.\n4",

The staff on duty did\nnot believe the girls were actually going to beat-up Youth A. The\nstaff person reported she would not be able to intervene physically\nif the girls did so. She would contact 911. Youth A told EMS, the\ngirls in the home have been threatening her.\n(2) During the EMS visit to the group home on 4/16/2024 Youth A\nreported she had been cutting herself to deal with the stress of\nmoving into the group home where she has lived since February\n2024.\n6",
    "Investigation\nAllegation (1)\nInterviews:\nOn 4/18/2024, I interviewed the Emergency Medical Technician\n(EMT) by telephone. The EMT reported during an emergency run\nto the facility where Youth A resides, Youth A reported youths\nwere threatening her. The EMT said while she was on the scene\nwith the Mt. Morris police, three youths came out to the porch area\nand threatened Youth A. One of the youth told Youth A if she\ncame back inside, they would beat her “ass”. The police told the\nyouths to go back inside. There was one staff with the youths,\nand this staff person refused to give her name; and did not seem\nto be concerned about the behaviors of the other youths toward\nYouth A. The staff person said she did not believe the youth(s)\nwould beat up Youth A, but if they tried, she could not intervene;\nthat she was pregnant, and she would have to call 911. The staff\nalso did not seem to know about Youth A’s parent/guardian\ninformation so as to who could give consent for EMS to transport\nYouth A. Additionally, the staff person said she could not leave to\naccompany Youth A to the hospital due to there being eight\nyouths in the home and she was the only staff. The EMT reported\nshe was concerned for Youth A’s safety due to Youth A alleging a\nyouth at the facility had a knife, the verbal threat by the other\nyouth, the staff’s behavior related to that threat; and the police\nindicating there had been a number of prior complaints to this\nfacility which they thought should be closed.\nOn 4/22/2024 I interviewed the PD by telephone; and spoke with\nher onsite on 4/25/2024. She was not onsite at the time of the\nEMS visit. She was not sure who made the call to EMS but the\nYouth Worker (YW) 1 was the afternoon staff onsite at the time of\nthe incident. The PD reported the YW 1 is pregnant but that does\nnot prohibit YW 1 from intervening in youth conflicts, by giving\ndirections to the youths as warranted to deescalate a situation.\nThe PD reported YW 1 deals with each situation seriously and\nutilizes the team when needed by making contacts with them and\nhaving them give input and assistance as able.\nThe PD reported the alleged incident of Youth A’s peer allegedly\nthreatening her was likely connected to a situation pertaining to a\nmale youth in another of the agency’s IL programs. She reported\nYouth A had alleged to her earlier in the day on 4/16/2024 that\nYouth E threatened her. Reportedly Youth A and Youth E met at\nan agency holiday event; and their relationship ended in or around\nApril 2024. According to Youth A, Youth E told Youth A if she was\npregnant, he would kill her. Due to that alleged threat, the PD\n7",
    "reported the agency assisted Youth A with a police report on\n4/16/2024. Youth A told the other youth in the house she filed the\npolice report against Youth E; and one or more of the youths were\nupset with Youth A about this, due to their friendship with Youth E.\nWords were exchanged between Youth A and one or more of the\nother youths. YW 1 sent a message to the team about the\nincident; and the police were also called. The PD reported the\nincident was likely still spilling over when the police and EMS\ncame on the scene related to the EMS call. She denied Youth A\nreporting anything about a knife, or anyone having a knife. She\nreported YW 2 was also coming onsite to relieve YW 1. She\ndenied a lack of supervision by staff.\nOn 4/24/2024 I interviewed Youth A’s Therapist by telephone\nrelated to the allegations. He was not onsite at the time of this\nincident; nor did he receive information that three youths had\nthreatened to beat up Youth A. He reported what he knew was\nsecondhand. He reported there was one youth, Youth A had an\nissue with, which was reportedly over a cell phone loan, and\nsomething (the specifics unknown) to do with a male youth; and\nYouth A may have misconstrued what she had heard. It was\nreported to him that Youth B, not three youths, had threatened\nYouth A. He reported Youth A reported having a verbal\ndisagreement with the youth, but she did not report that youth’s\nname at the time or tell him what the verbal argument was about.\nHe said the same youth that Youth A was complaining about is the\none she is hanging out with now. He reported it is a behavior\npattern of Youth A’s to not be sincere in her statements about\nissues. That one-minute Youth A will complain about her peers,\nand in the next she is going to activities with those peers. The\nTherapist reported he believes Youth A is safe in this placement\nwith her peers. He did not report any concerns about her\nsupervision.\nOn 4/25/2024 while onsite at the IL home, I interviewed the House\nManager, Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, YW 1 and YW 2\nabout the allegations. Youth B refused to speak with me.\nThe House Manager reported there had been a lot going on that\nday due to the youth gossiping; and Youth A reportedly getting on\nthe phone and telling some untruths. The House Manager said\ntensions were high prior to the police arriving the second time.\nShe said she made the first police call related to allegations Youth\nA reported to the PD related to Youth E, as described earlier in\nthis report by the PD. She reported Youth B who has always been\nclose to Youth A, and concerned for Youth A’s well-being was\n8",
    "upset by what Youth A reported about Youth E. That Youth B’s\nboyfriend and Youth E are all friends. Youth B and Youth A had\nwords about this situation. She said Youth B can be verbally\n“vulgar “, curse, and Youth B was reportedly still upset and argued\nat Youth A when the police arrived.\nThe House Manager reported she was not onsite when the police\narrived the second time, but what was reported to her was Youth\nB made the verbal threat to beat up Youth A, and the other youth\nwere trying to get Youth B to come back to her room. As to YW 1\nsaying to EMS that YW 1 did not believe the youth would attack\nYouth A, the House Manager reported this was likely due to the\nfact that YW 1 knows Youth B’s tendency to be very “verbal and\nvulgar”; and Youth B has never acted on her threats. The House\nManager reported Youth A is normally the instigator of trouble and\nwhen caught, Youth A tries to redirect the situation to something\nor someone else. The House Manager reported the staff try to\nredirect Youth A’s inappropriate actions, as they do with other\nyouths. She reported staff address youths’ conflicts and threats of\nfights by trying to get the less aggressor of the youths to go to\ntheir room; or having both youths to go to their room to calm\ndown, so staff can talk with them.\nYouth A reported while the police and EMS were onsite at the IL\nhome on 4/16/2024 Youth B came to the door and told her “I’m\nbeating your ass”. There were three youths there but only Youth\nB threatened her. The others, whom she would not name said,\n“come inside and see”. Youth A stated Youth B said what Youth B\nsaid because Youth B wanted to fight her. Youth A denied\nknowing why Youth B wanted to fight her. She said the youths\nwere being “messy”; but she would not explain what that meant.\nShe would not report Youth B or anyone having a knife, she said\nshe just wants this thing dropped. That she and Youth B, and the\nother youths talked, and they are friends. She admitted staff\nintervene when any of the youths try to fight. She said the staff\ncan’t touch them to do this, but they use de-escalation or call 911.\nShe reported feeling safe in this placement.\nYouth C reported they play and joke around with each other a lot.\nYouth C did not disclose any information about what may have\nhappened between the youth on 4/16/2024, when the police and\nEMS had come to the facility; she said she had to leave. She\nreported they know they are not to fight, but if they get into any\nkind of altercation, staff will intervene and tell them to stop. She\nreported feeling safe in this IL home.\n9",
    "Youth D reported staff tend to not let youth arguments escalate.\nStaff will try to deescalate the issue, suggest space between them\nby telling the youths involved to go to their room. Staff will also\ncall the police. Youth D was not aware of any youth fights since\nher placement in the home two weeks ago. She admitted that on\n4/16/2024 there were youths arguing and one youth had\nthreatened to beat up Youth A. She reported what happened was\nnot out of the normal, that youths get angry, argue, threaten to\nfight and then are ok with one another. She indicated this is what\nhappened with Youth A. Youth D was not aware of anyone having\na knife. She said Youth A came from the hospital and everything\nwas okay again with her and the other youths. Everyone was\nokay with one another. Youth D reported feeling safe in this IL\nhome.\nYW 2 reported, she was not onsite when EMS and the police\narrived onsite on 4/16/2024. She reported there was some type\nof incident between Youth A and Youth B over a phone Youth B\nloaned to Youth A; and Youth B wanting it back. She did not\nreport any direct information about any youths threatening Youth\nA. She acknowledged what others had related to what staff do\nwhen youths argue or want to fight. They try to calm the situation\ndown, suggest youths separate; and if necessary call 911.\nYW 1 reported, she was the staff on shift on 4/16/2024 when the\nalleged incident occurred. She reported the police arrived and\nreported someone called EMS, who were on the way. She denied\nnot allowing Youth A to speak with the official privately; or to ever\ntrying to talk over Youth A. She denied ever seeing three youths\noutside or anyone other than Youth B threatening Youth A. She\nsaid she was back and forth talking with the officer and checking\non the youths. She admitted there was a time that she heard\nYouth B yell something to the effect “I will beat your ass” and the\npolice told Youth B to go back inside, but she was not sure if\nYouth B was actually outside or was just at the door. She said the\nother two youths, were telling Youth B to stop and come in. YW 1\nsaid she thought the situation with Youth A and Youth B which\nhad occurred long before the police arrived had calmed down and\nwas over. The arguing had stopped, and Youth A was in her room.\nYW1 admitted she told the EMT something to the effect that she\ndid not believe Youth B would follow up on her threat to harm\nYouth A. She reported saying this because Youth B “was talking\njunk”, which is what Youth B does; but also, because Youth B and\nYouth A are close/always together; and Youth B does not fight.\nShe was surprised the two had argued. She also admitted to\n10",
    "telling the EMT she was pregnant; and if a fight were to break out\nshe could not get between the youths to break them up. YW1\nreported that is also true if she was not pregnant. She reported\nshe would try to talk with the youths to encourage them to stop;\nand if they would not comply and if she could not deescalate the\nsituation, she would call the police.\nOn 5/6/2024 I interviewed Youth A’s FCW about the allegations by\ntelephone. She was not onsite at the time of the alleged incident.\nShe reported Youth A told her later, that a youth had threatened to\nbeat her up, but Youth A had not given her any details. Youth A\nhas not reported any concerns about that peer since; and the two\nyouths are friend again.\nIt is noted that neither of the staff interviewed reported anything\nabout Youth A mentioning to either of them information about a\nknife.\nAllegation (2)\nInterviews\nOn 4/18/2024, I interviewed the EMT by telephone. The EMT\nreported during an emergency run to the facility where Youth A\nresides, Youth A reported concerns about being at the facility.\nYouth A reported moving to the facility in February 2024; and that\nshe had cut herself to deal with the stress of moving. Youth A\nalso reported youths were threatening to beat her up (as\nexamined earlier in this report). Youth A also showed the EMT a\ncut mark on her left arm. Youth A did not say when or how she\nhad cut her arm. The EMT did not report the size of the mark or\nhow old it appeared. The EMT reported she did not know or report\nanything about a safety plan or suicidal behavior for Youth A. The\nEMT reported she was concerned for Youth A’s safety. She\nreported the staff had not given her name and did not have\ninformation related to the youth and consent for transport. The\nEMT reported getting supervisory approval to transport the youth.\nOn 4/22/2024 I interviewed the PD by telephone related to the\nallegations and had a follow up telephone conversation with her\nrelated to this allegation on 5/21/2024.\nThe PD acknowledged Youth A has had some peer interaction\nstruggles which is a part off her past history as is self-harming or\ncutting behavior. The PD reported no knowledge of the latter\nbehavior being reported for Youth A since Youth A’s February\n2024 placement in the program. She reported if cutting behavior\n11",
    "had occurred, staff would have safety planned with Youth A\naround it.\nThe PD reported there had not been an issue with EMS being\nunable to transport Youth A, or the agency staff not having\ninformation related to the youth/the agency right’s to provide care\nonsite. She reported the agency has a binder with consent\ninformation and YW 1 showed that to EMS and tried to explain\nthings, but EMS was not accepting of that.\nOn 4/24/2024 I interviewed Youth A’s Therapist related to the\nallegations. I had a follow up contact with him by telephone on\n5/21/2024. He reported, self-harming may have been a part of\nYouth A’s past history, but he could not recall from Youth A’s\nreferral data the last time such behavior was reported as having\noccurred. He reported Youth A has not displayed such behavior\nsince her placement in the IL home. He denied an awareness of\nYouth A cutting herself, and reported Youth A never reported she\nwas cutting herself due to stress. Nor had Youth A showed him a\ncut or mark on her arm that she allegedly inflicted on herself. He\nsaid Youth A has a history of reporting things that are not true,\nespecially if it gets her attention or a rise from the person, she is\nreporting the matter to. He reported when things Youth A alleges\nare explored, it usually shows inconsistences; and Youth A\nchanges her story. He reported completing three separate safety\nplans with Youth A around her behaviors of peer encounters and\naggression, and inappropriate social interactions and or posting\non her cell phone and social media (all as reported and described\nearlier in this report). He reported if self-harming or cutting\nbehavior had been known or reported to him, he would have\ncompleted a safety plan with Youth A around this behavior. He\nwould have also completed a suicide assessment and or sought\nother resources if warranted.\nOn 5/6/2024 I interviewed Youth A’s FCW by telephone. I had a\nfollow-up telephone interview with her on 5/22/2024; and email\ncommunication from her on 6/4/2024. The FCW reported any\nconcern she has around Youth A’s mental health were as reported\nearlier in this reported related to Youth A’s immaturity, medication\nand medical appointment refusal. She denied any direct\nknowledge of Youth A self-harming related to stress. As to\nwhether Youth A had any cutting behaviors, the FCW reported\nabout one week after Youth A had gone to the hospital on\n4/16/2024, Youth A told her, she had cut her arm; and Youth A\nshowed her what appeared to be an old scratch mark on Youth\nA’s arm. The FCW could not recall which arm. The FCW said had\n12",
    "she seen the mark any other time, she would not have thought\nanything about it. The FCW also acknowledged cutting as a past\nbehavior for Youth A; and stated this alleged reporting of such\nbehavior by Youth A was the first since Youth A’s placement at\nthis IL home. The FCW did not recall asking Youth A for details\nabout the mark/what Youth A alleged. At that time, she did not\nask Youth A whether Youth A cut her arm on purpose,\naccidentally, or when the alleged cut occurred. She did not share\nthis information with the Therapist; she stated she forgot. Nor did\nshe write the incident up via a case note or complete a safety\nplan. She reported not writing it because she has so many\ncontacts with the youths in a day (given they are in the same\nbuilding) she does not always document all interactions.\nThe FCW said she followed up with Youth A a couple of times\nafter Youth A showed her the mark to see if Youth A was ok. The\ncontacts were one to two days after Youth A’s reporting and Youth\nA reported she was fine. The FCW could not recall if she\ndocumented the follow up contacts. She did not report any\nconcerns for Youth A’s supervision.\nIt is noteworthy the Therapist and FCW followed up with Youth A\nfollowing my last telephone conservation with them and completed\na safety plan with Youth A around any potential self-harming/\ncutting behavior. A copy of this safety plan was provided to me\nand is dated 5/22/2024.\nOn 4/25/2024 I interviewed Youth A onsite at the IL home. She\ndid not report cutting herself or telling anyone she had. As\nmentioned earlier in this report, Youth A reported the program is\nmeeting her needs, that she feels safe here; and there being no\nother place for her to go. Additionally, that she intends to leave the\nprogram once she turns 18.\nOn 4/25/2024 I interviewed YW 1 about the allegations onsite. I\nhad a follow-up telephone interview with her about this allegation\non 5/22/2024. YW 1 denied Youth A ever mentioning anything to\nher about cutting herself, prior to Youth A’s ER visit or since then.\nYW 1 reported during the ER visit Youth A never mentioned\ncutting herself. Youth A never talked about this to the doctor. The\nonly thing Youth A talked about was pain on her side. YW 1\nrecalled Youth A wearing long sleeves that day, and she did not\nsee any cuts or marks to Youth A. She reported had that been\npart of the incident or if Youth A had reported such during the ER\nvisit, she would have reported this.\n13",
    "Document Review\n• Youth A MISACWIS case record and prior incident reports\nfrom her past placement as indicated earlier in this report.\n• Copy of Safety Plans dated 2/15/2024, 3/22/2024, and\n4/18/2024, which indicated information as reported by the\nTherapist. All signed/agreed to by Youth A.\n• Copy of a Safety Plan dated 5/22/2024 related to Youth A\nreporting self-harm, cutting, which was signed/agreed to by\nYouth A 5/23/2024.\n• DHS-1105 for FTMs for Youth A on 2/22/2024; and\n3/21/2024 around Youth A’s inappropriate potential risky\nbehaviors on social medica; and following house rules and\nbeing honest with IL staff.\n• Youth A’s updated service plan which showed:\n➢ The agency was working with Youth A around her\nbehaviors.\n➢ The FCW was documenting monthly and various\nwell-being and service contacts with Youth A.\n➢ Notation related to Youth A reporting side pain on\n4/4/2024 and being taken to urgency; as well as her\na 4/17/2024 indication Youth A called EMS and was\ntaken by EMS for treatment for reported side pain on\n4/17/2024.\n➢ Youth A reported at one point her pain was in her\nback, then in her side, and also that she had no\npain.\n➢ No indication of Youth A reporting she cut her arm or\nshowed the FCW a cut or mark on her arm.\n• A 4/16/2024 Emergency Room After Visit Summary, which\nindicated Youth A was treated for “Flank Pain”. Tylenol was\ngiven.\n• No documentation of a social work contact by the FCW of\nYouth A reporting she cut her arm, showed the FCW a cut\nor mark on her arm.\n• An Independent Living-Plus Contract signed by Youth A\nand the agency on 2/5/2024 that indicated: Youth A agrees\nto meet with the worker at twice monthly related to\nindependent living supervision and support/service plan\nrequirements; and the agency worker will meet with the\nyouth twice monthly to assist the youth in meeting the\nrequirement of the contract and skill development; as well\nas to provide or arrange for any necessary services.\nAnalysis Allegation 1\nThe agency is in compliance with rule. A staff was present with\nYouth A and the other youths when EMS and the police arrived.\nThe staff on site had been addressing a conflict between Youth A\n14",
    "and Youth B prior. Sometime during or after that incident, Youth A\ncalled EMS and complained about pain in her side.\nAllegation 2\nThe agency is in violation of the rule. The PD, and Therapist both\nreported Youth A had a history of self-harming by way of cutting,\nand they were not aware of such behavior or reporting of such\nbehavior by Youth A since Youth A’s February 2024 placement\ninto the program. Conversely, the FCW who also acknowledged\nan awareness of Youth A’s past history of self-harming by cutting,\nreported a week or so after 4/16/2024 Youth A disclosed she had\ncut herself. The FCW reported the cut Youth A showed her was\nan old scratch mark; and she did not explore the matter further\nwith Youth A at that time. The FCW seemingly concluded since\nYouth A had a habit of reporting false information, that was the\ncase in this incident. The FCW did not document this alleged\nreporting by Youth A or report the matter to Youth A’s therapist so\nthat it could be explored further and that a safety plan could be\nenacted.\nGiven Youth A’s past history of self-harming by cutting at the point\nthat Youth A alleged that act to the FCW, safety planning was\nwarranted so as to ensure for Youth A supervision around this\nissue. That did not occur at that time.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code Medical, dental and mental health care\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12507\nSection (1) An agency shall ensure that a youth in independent living\nDescription receives any needed medical, dental, and mental health care as\nrequired in R 400.12413. Medical, dental, and mental health care\nprovided must be documented in the youth's record.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A had been complaining of back pain; and had been taken\nto urgent care, but a staff talked over her when she was providing\ninformation. On 4/16/2024 Youth A needed to be transported to\nthe hospital and called 911 because staff would not take her.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 4/22/2024 I interviewed the PD related to the allegations; I also\nspoke with her onsite on 4/25/2024.\n15",
    "The PD denied the agency not seeking medical attention for Youth\nA. She reported Youth A had previously been taken to urgent\ncare for an issue with her side, and staff were reporting that Youth\nA was not following the doctor’s instructions. Additionally on the\ndate the allegation was reported related to an EMS site visit Youth\nA had not reported pain to staff or needing to go for medical\ntreatment.\nThe PD reported there had not been an issue with EMS being\nunable to transport Youth A, or the agency staff not having\ninformation related to the youth or the agency right’s to provide\ncare. She reported the agency has a binder with consent\ninformation and YW 1 showed this to EMS and tried to explain\nthings, but EMS was not accepting of that. The PD reported the IL\nhome used to be a child caring institution facility and the police\nand EMS continue to not understand that Holy Cross is an IL\nhome, and how the IL placement works, despite outreach she has\nput forth with these units.\nOn 4/24/2024 I interviewed Youth A’s Therapist by telephone\nrelated to the allegations. The Therapist reported Youth A said it\nwas her side, not her back that she was having pain with. Youth A\ntold him she had fallen on her side when she was wrestling with\nYouth C. He reported that Youth A told him the information about\nthe wrestling weeks ago. He said, Youth A had not come to him\ncomplaining of pain or indicating a need or desire to go for\nmedical care. Nor had Youth A told him she had asked other staff\nto take her for care and they had not, or that they had refused her.\nOn 4/25/2024 I interviewed the House Manager, Youth A, Youth\nB, Youth C, Youth D and YW 1 and YW 2 onsite at the IL home.\nYouth B refused to speak with me.\nThe House Manager reported on 4/4/2024 Youth A went to\nurgent care due to a complaint of her side hurting. Youth A had\nreported hurting her side due to wrestling with another youth.\nAfter the urgent care visit on 4/4/2024 the House Manager denied\nYouth A complaining of pain. She said Youth A continued to\nhorse play, ride her bike and so on. Youth A was also not icing\nher side or using heat as directed by the doctor. The House\nManager said on 4/16/2024 staff called her and reported EMS and\nthe police were on site and wanted to take Youth A to the hospital\nto have her checked out for pain. She said she was surprised by\nEMS’s presence, because she had seen Youth A that day and\nYouth A had not complained of pain; nor had Youth A told her she\nneeded to go to urgent care or the emergency room. Youth A had\n16",
    "been participating in normal activities; and at one point was sitting\nand playing around with Youth B by kicking Youth B in the butt.\nShe said there had been a lot going on that day due to the youths\ngossiping and Youth A reportedly getting on the phone and telling\nsome untruths. She reported due to youths’ interactions, tensions\nwere high prior to the police arriving.\nThe House Manager reported she could not definitively say Youth\nA was not in any pain; but she suspected Youth A called EMS to\nget herself out of a situation with her peers. She said normally\nwhen Youth A gets herself into a situation Youth A will make\nthings up to get herself out of it; but this is the first time Youth A\nhas called 911. She said the doctor did not see a need for Youth A\nto go to the hospital/stay at the hospital. They advised follow up\nwith the primary doctor. The agency scheduled the follow up\nmedical appointment and Youth A refused to attend it.\nYouth A acknowledged hurting her side while playing around with\nYouth C. She was tackled to the bed and in the process,\naccidentally hit her left side on the bed. There was no bruise. She\nsaid she did not go to urgent care for this. She went to urgent care\nfor a pulled muscle on her side a couple of days before she called\n911 on 4/16/2024. She was not sure how she pulled the muscle.\nShe vacillated about the two and reported prior to going to the\nhospital on 4/16/2024 she had been complaining of pain to her\nside for more than just that day. When she complained, staff told\nher to use warm compresses or put ice on it; or that they could not\ntake her to the doctor, because they could not arrange for\ntransportation. She could not recall which day she had reported\npain or to which specific staff. She reported when she had gone to\nurgent care for her side, the doctor said everything looked fine,\ntold her to use ice or heat compresses and gave her muscle\nrelaxers, which did not help. She reported on the day she called\n911 she complained to YW 1 and YW 1 told her to put ice on it.\nYouth A said she put ice on her side, but it did not help and that’s\nwhen she called 911 and EMS. Youth A did not report whether\nshe told YW 1 that the ice did not help or that she needed to go to\nER.\nYouth A said when EMS and the police were onsite YW1 tried to\ntalk over her and kept cutting her off, so she asked to speak with\none of the two police officers separately. She denied YW 1 trying\nto interrupt or talk over her when she was at the hospital being\nexamined. She admitted the staff scheduled a follow up medical\nappointment for her which she refused to attend.\n17",
    "Youth C admitted to wrestling with Youth A but could not recall\nwhen. She said Youth A hit her side on the door frame. She said\nstaff did not refuse to take Youth A for care. She said Youth A\nwould sometimes say her side was hurting, then Youth A would\nsay it wasn’t hurting.\nYouth D reported only being in this IL home for two weeks. She\nwas not aware of Youth A or any youth complaining of pain and\nstaff not talking to the youth about their concern, or not taking the\nyouth for medical care. She reported being sick a couple of times\nand staff has taken her for treatment. No staff has refused to take\nher for care.\nYW 2 reported she was not onsite when EMS and the police\narrived onsite on 4/16/2024. She was called back on shift so that\nYW 1 could go to the hospital to be with Youth A. She reported\nYouth A had complained of side pain around 6:30pm after a\ndisagreement over a phone with Youth B. She advised Youth A to\nuse an ice compress; and prior to her departing her shift Youth A\nreported being fine. She also admitted Youth A had complained\nto her about pain to her side approximately two times in the past\ntwo weeks. Youth A had said she had a big bruise on her side,\nand it hurt. YW 2 looked at Youth A’s side and no bruising was\nseen. YW 2 reported when Youth A first reported hurting her side,\na staff person took Youth A to urgent care. Thereafter YW 2\nrecalled Youth A being seen a couple of other times, but YW 2 did\nnot know when. YW 2 reported what others had reported related\nto the doctor advising Youth A to use heat or ice if she was\nuncomfortable; and she had advised Youth A to do that. Youth A\nhad not followed those instructions.\nYW 1 reported information similarly to YW 2 and the House\nManager. She also denied Youth A complaining of pain on\n4/16/2024 and Youth A refusing to attend her follow-up medical\nappointment on 4/24/2024. She said Youth A never left her room\non 4/16/2024. She reported when Youth A had complained of\npain in the past, Youth A never behaved as such, or followed\nstaff’s instructions as advised by the urgent care doctor. She said\nhad Youth A been in real pain in the past, Youth A would never\nhave stopped telling staff about it or asking to go to the hospital or\nurgent care.\nYW 1 reported when the police and EMS arrived on 4/16/2024,\nbetween 10:00am-10:15pm she was in the office and Youth A was\nin her room. The police arrived first and reported Youth A called\nEMS, who were on the way. YW 1 denied not having information\n18",
    "about Youth A, she told EMS the agency could consent to Youth\nA’s transport and showed EMS Youth A’s placement face sheet\nand insurance. It was EMS who kept bringing up Youth A’s\nparents. She also denied not allowing Youth A to speak with EMS\nand the police privately; or to ever talking over Youth A. She was\nback and forth with EMS and the police; and Youth A spoke with\neach without her as well. While at the hospital Youth A also spoke\nwith the medical staff freely; and spoke with a social worker.\nYouth A told the doctor the pain was on her side, near her\nstomach area; and that her pain was a level 10. The hospital did\nan ultrasound and kidney test and reported they found nothing.\nYW 1 said Youth A has not complained of pain since this hospital\nvisit.\nOn 5/6/2024 I interviewed the FCW by telephone about the\nallegations. She affirmed information as reported by the House\nManager related to Youth A going to urgent care after reporting\nshe had hurt her side during a horse playing incident with a peer.\nAdditionally, Youth A was advised by urgent care to apply hot and\ncold compresses to her side as reported by others. The FCW\ncould not recall the day of the horsing playing incident. She also\nsaid Youth A was not consistently doing what she was advised by\nthe doctor or staff. The FCW reported that three or four days after\nthe urgent care visit Youth A told her she had pain on her side.\nThe FCW was not sure of the time frame of Youth A’s reporting\nbut indicated Youth A had been doing normal activities, running,\nriding her bike, etc. At those reporting the FCW inquired whether\nYouth A had been applying the hot and cold patches. Youth A said\nshe had not, and the FCW encouraged her to do so. At one time\nYouth A stated she may need to go to urgent care again, but\nYouth A said not now. The FCW advised Youth A to let staff know\nof her need, so if a trip to urgent care was needed, the agency\ncould ensure staff coverage so Youth A can be taken.\nThe FCW reported the agency has sought medical care for Youth\nA when she has required it. She reported Youth A demands a lot\nof attention and based on things she has observed, Youth A has\nreported a lot of untruths; and may have embellished the issue\nwith her side. The FCW suspected the latter because she has\nobserved Youth A touching or holding her side when approaching\nher, but when Youth A thought she was not watching Youth A\nwould remove her hand and would walk normally. The FCW also\nconfirmed what others reported related to Youth A’s refusal to go\nfor her follow up appointment following the 4/16/2024 hospital\nvisit.\n19",
