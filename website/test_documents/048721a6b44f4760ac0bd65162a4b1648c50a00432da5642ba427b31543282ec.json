The one\nCAP provided was in response to the 7/21/2023 licensing inspection report. That\nCAP was approved on 8/8/2023 and addressed two violations, both of which were\nrelated to policy requirements. Both of those citations were repeated this year and\nwill require additional corrective action planning. One of the remaining three\nviolations established this year is a repeat of a 2022 violation regarding visiting a\nyouth in the youth's placement every month and was addressed through a CAP\ndated 8/23/22. The two non-repeat violations established this year were related to\nspecial evaluation over 45-days and FTM paperwork.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator identified issues related to lending agencies failing to add\ncourtesy workers when borrowing foster homes, difficulty obtaining PATP\nsignatures from AWOL and incarcerated parent as well as parents and caregivers\nwho are unhappy with the direction the case is taking.
