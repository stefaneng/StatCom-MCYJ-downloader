Foster Care Worker 1 stated the facility did a\nspecial bag of treats for Youth A due to Youth A’s allergies. Foster Care Worker 1\nstated Youth A knows what he is allergic to and Foster Care Worker 1 was currently in\ntransit to see Youth A. Foster Care Worker 1 stated she had requested an Incident\nReport of the situation but had not yet received an incident report.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 11/13/2020. Youth A alleged he did not have a\nspecial bag of treats and the youth did not swap treats with each other. Youth A stated\nhe is allergic to peanuts, eggs, and seafood. Youth A stated he ate some treats\ncontaining peanuts, Reese Peanut Butter Cups, and Butterfingers.

Staff 1\nstated the bags were given to the youth on Friday and the youth began swapping the\ncontents of their bags with each other on Friday evening.

The facility staff contacted Great Lakes Bay medical\nprovider after hours and they were told to monitor Youth A for any allergic reaction\nsymptoms and give Youth A some Benadryl. Staff 1 stated Youth A was given Benadryl\nand Youth A did not demonstrate any symptoms.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 11/13/2020.
