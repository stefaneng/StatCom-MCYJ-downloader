EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nperiod under review and the compliance with the CAP is as follows: The CAP was\nfor last year’s interim audit for employee records not having a performance\nevaluation and references completed after employement. There were four special\ninvestigations during the period under review with none of the investigations\nrequiring a CAP. CAP monitoring was conducted with the facility and the facility\nhas complied with the CAP.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on review of the facility's budget\nand agency's financial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThere was a fire at one of the licensed houses on property where the youths in\nthat home moved to Hainley House. As a result, Hainley House changed their\nprogram from short-term intensive stabilization to mental health/behavior\nstabilization programing. This was not the direction Eagle Village saw for Hainley\nHouse but due to circumstances things changed and they adjusted accordingly.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed stated feeling the house was in a \"reset\" mode after having youth\nmove from a different house on campus due to a fire at that house into the Hainley\nHouse. Staff reported the youth are getting their needs met, Eagle Village goes\nabove and beyond for the youth and staff have been more consistent with firm\nexpectations. Staff did not identify any concerns.\nYouth interviewed reported having many activities available to them on campus\nand going on \"adventures\" off campus. Youth stated staff step in to stop youth\nwho bully or try to fight. Youth were able to name multiple staff who are their\nfavorites and did not express any concerns with how staff interact with them. The\nyouth interviewed did not express any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walk through of the facility occurred on January 2 and\n25, 2024. There were no issues or safety concerns.",
