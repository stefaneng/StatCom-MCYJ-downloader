    "INVESTIGATION:\nA complaint was received on 1/31/22 alleging Youth A’s peers were doing sexual\nthings with Youth A in bedrooms and bathrooms at the facility. Youth K tried to get\nYouth A to have sex with him and offered Youth A money and jewelry, but Youth A\nwould not have sex with Youth K. Youth K was jealous because Youth A was doing\nsexual acts with the other youth in the house but would not with Youth K.\nInterviews:\nA phone call was placed to the Program Director (PD) on 1/31/22. He reported an\ninterpreter told him about the allegations last night around 9pm. The conversation\nbetween the youth occurred while in the van to go bowling. There was Interpreter 1,\nFederal Employee 3, and a Samaritas staff in the van with the youth. He was unsure\nwhich Samaritas staff was present. PD said this happened around 4pm on 1/29/22.\nHe was unsure why Interpreter 1 did not tell him immediately. He stated the\nSamaritas staff was driving the van at the time. PD asked Youth A a few questions\nabout it and the youth denied anything happened.\nAll youth interviewed are from Afghanistan and required the use of an\ninterpreter for their interviews.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/1/22. He does not have any\nproblems with the youth or staff. He reported the staff keep a good eye on the youth.\nHe feels safe at the facility and there is never a time when staff are not supervising\nhim. When Youth A was asked about being touched, he became frustrated. He\nasked why I was asking. He said “no” when asked if anyone touched him. He then\nwalked out of the room saying he had already talked to someone about this, and he\nwas done talking.\nYouth J was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/1/22. He stated he gets\nalong with both staff and youth at the facility. His roommate is Youth A. Staff\nsupervise them all the time except when they use the bathroom. Staff watch the\nyouth when they are in their bedroom. He reported he has not been touched or\nheard of anyone at the facility who has been touched in a sexual way. He feels safe\nat the facility.\nYouth F, Youth G, and Youth I were interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/1/22.\nYouth B, Youth C, Youth D, Youth E, Youth H, and Youth K were all interviewed face\nto face at the facility on 2/9/22. They all reported staff keep a close eye on them\nincluding watching the hallways when they are in their bedrooms. They all denied\nanything sexual was happening between any of the youth.\nInterpreter 1 was interviewed by telephone on 2/11/22 and again face to face at the\nfacility on 3/10/22 along with the DHHS Worker. While in the van going bowling, the\nyouth were talking about having sex with Youth A. Interpreter 1 did not know all of\n6",
    "the youths’ names. Out of 11 youth there were three youth who did not have a\nsexual relationship with Youth A. The youth said they had sex with Youth A in his\nbedroom closet. Interpreter 1 stated he was not sure if the youth were just joking\naround. The following day, Interpreter 1 was sitting in the room with the youth when\nthey were talking about a meeting they had in which they discussed not telling\nanyone what they talked about. The youth asked Interpreter 1 not to say anything.\nThis led Interpreter 1 to believe something had happened between Youth A and the\nother youth. He contacted his manager who advised him to talk to PD. He contacted\nPD the day after he heard the youth talking.\nFederal Employee 3 was interviewed by telephone on 2/11/22. He stated when they\nwere on their way to go bowling, he was in the last seat next to one of the youths.\nFederal Employee 3 did not know any of the youth's names as it was his first day at\nthe shelter. The youth were having a casual conversation when one of them said he\noffered another youth a necklace and money to have sex with him, but the youth\nwould not. It was said that the youth who denied him was having sex with all the\nother youth but refused him. Federal employee 3 stated he reported the\nconversation to his supervisor the following day.\nThe Volunteer Coordinator for the federal employees was interviewed face to face at\nthe facility on 2/24/22 she reported the staff do a good job watching the youth.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via three-way telephone call on 3/3/22. She reported she did\nnot have any concerns about the supervision provided by the staff.\nPD was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/2022 and he reported staff\nwatch the hallway.\nTherapist was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/9/22. She reported the staff\ndo a good job of supervising the youth.\nDocuments Viewed:\n An e-mail from PD dated 1/30/22 reported the above allegations. Youth A\nrefused to leave his bedroom which he shared with Youth J. PD wrote Youth\nA would be staffed one-on-one until further notice.\n E-mail’s from PD on 2/3/22 indicated the safety plan was to staff Youth A with\na one-on-one staff.\n 15-minute varying room check logs from 1/23/22 to 1/29/22 were viewed and\nall logs were completed.\n Youth Case files: All 11 case files were reviewed. All the youth were admitted\nto the Shelter on 1/4/22. Many of them have been verbally and physically\naggressive toward both youth and staff. They also have destroyed property,\nthreatened self-harm, and ran away. None of the youth had any sexual acting\nout or sexual abuse history indicated.\n7",
    " E-mail from Staff 1 indicating Youth J needed a staff member to sit outside\nthe bathroom while he showered because Youth J was afraid the other youth\nwould enter.\n Facility policies and procedures. None of the policies address supervision of\nthe youth.\n Shelter Handbook: Youth need to be in staff’s line of sight and when in their\nbedrooms staff will complete checks not to exceed 15-minutes.\n Significant Incident Reports (SIR): The SIR from this incident indicated the\nsame information that PD reported in his e-mail.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency’s\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: According to the youth and staff interviewed staff were\nsupervising the youth adequately.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLIGATION:\nThe facility is not following their safety plan set up to protect Youth A.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the unannounced visit on 2/18/22, it was discovered the safety plan put in\nplace on 2/1/22 for the above allegation was not being followed. Youth A and Youth\nB were sharing a bedroom again and the facility was not staffing Youth A with one-\non-one supervision.\nInterviews:\nPD was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/18/22. He reported Youth A and\nYouth J are sharing a bedroom. He said the facility is not staffing the one-on-one nor\nwas a staff sitting in the youth’s bedroom doorway when they were in the bedroom\ntogether. The bedroom door was left open, and staff were checking on the youth\nthroughout the night every 15 minutes. PD reported they provided one-on-one\nstaffing when they could but did not have enough staff to do it all the time. He stated\nit was also difficult to get the federal employees to sit in the youth's doorway.\n8",
    "Youth A was interviewed face to face at the facility along with the DHHS Worker on\n2/28/22. He reported he is happy he has his own bedroom, as previously, Youth J\nshared the bedroom with him. He reported he never felt uncomfortable with Youth J\nin the bedroom. They each had their own bed and never shared a bed.\nYouth J was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/28/22 along with the DHHS\nWorker. Youth J stated he often fights with Youth A. He never slept in the same bed\nas Youth A. They did share a bedroom. The youth would sleep with the door open\nbecause they were scared. The staff would walk by with a flashlight about every 2\nminutes. They also leave the light on in the bedroom. Now that he is no longer\nsharing a bedroom with Youth A, he does not let Youth A in his bedroom. He was\ngiven a new bedroom because he and Youth A fought a lot.\nThe Clinical Supervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/24/22 along\nwith the DHHS Worker. She had been informed by PD on 2/18/22 that this\ninvestigation was completed and there were no findings. PD told her the\ninvestigation was over but that the one-on-one supervision of Youth A needed to\ncontinue. The staff were under the impression that the sexual assault did not occur.\nWhen the safety plan was first put in place it was verbally communicated to staff and\nwas sent in an e-mail. The one-on-one log was sent out after 2/18/22. She confirmed\nthere were not enough Samaritas youth specialists to provide one-on-one staffing for\nYouth A. Youth J would move back and forth from Youth A's bedroom. There was no\nway to stop the youth from sharing a bedroom. The staffing in both houses include 3\nstaff from 7am-5pm, 2 or 3 staff from 3pm-11pm, and 2 staff from 11pm-7am.\nSamaritas staff were aware of the safety plan, but it was not communicated to the\nfederal employees. She was not sure if the Samaritas staff were aware of why Youth\nA needed one-on-one staffing. An e-mail regarding the one-on-one staffing for Youth\nA was sent to staff the night of the allegation. She reported Samaritas staff do not\nknow what the federal employees can and cannot do and what information they can\nand cannot have.\nThe Volunteer Coordinator (VC) was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n2/24/22 along with the DHHS Worker. She is a federal employee who coordinates\nthe other federal employees. The federal employees work twelve-hour shifts and\nthere is one in each house at a time. The federal employees are to provide line of\nsight supervision of the youth. They can conduct one-on-one supervision if they are\ninstructed too. She had not had any communication with PD, only the direct care\nstaff. She was not informed of any safety plans with the youth. She knew Youth A\nneeded one-on-one staffing but was never informed why. When she is around, she\nhas observed the staff performing the one-on-one staffing and have the youth in line\nof sight. VC reported the Samaritas staff are experiencing challenges because the\nyouth in the program are of a different culture than they are used to serving. She\ndoes not believe any of them would intentionally hurt the youth.\nTherapist was interviewed face to face at the facility along with the DHHS Worker on\n3/9/22. She is the therapist for Youth A and Youth J. Youth A and Youth J have not\n9",
    "disclosed anything sexual to her. She was aware of the allegations and always looks\nfor any concerns. Therapist completes a risk assessment with the youth every 30\ndays that asks them about sexual activity. The youth have not reported any\nconcerns. When the allegations first became known, the facility had issues with\nmaintaining the one-on-one staffing for Youth A, but she reported it has been better\nthe last few weeks. She was informed PD tried to get Youth A to move bedrooms,\nbut he would not. Eventually they were able to get Youth J to switch bedrooms, but\nhe would go back and forth from his bedroom to Youth A's. Staff did not sit in the\nyouth’s doorway when the youth were together in Youth A's bedroom. She feels the\nSamaritas staff are adequately supervising the youth.\nFederal Staff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility along with the DHHS\nWorker on 3/9/22. He is aware of Youth A and Youth J. He did not have any\nconcerns about them being sexual with each other. He heard rumors from a\nSamaritas staff that Youth A was a victim of sexual harassment. He did not know\nwho told him this. He was not aware of any safety plans with Youth A. He reported\nsomeone is always supervising Youth A because he is aggressive. Youth A usually\nsleeps in the living room.\nI contacted Chief Administrator (CA) on 2/18/22 via telephone. She was informed the\nsafety plan was not being followed and Youth A did not have a one-on-one staff,\nYouth A and Youth J were back to sharing a bedroom and staff were not siting in\ntheir doorway at night to keep an eye on them and that the two youth also had\nblankets tied to their bed posts making it difficult for staff to see them in their beds.\nShe was informed a new plan needed to be put in place to keep Youth A safe. On\n2/24/22 I informed CA Youth A still did not have one-on-one supervision and another\nyouth was able to enter his room without the staff noticing. On 3/10/22 I informed CA\nthe safety plan was not being followed again when Youth A’s one-on-one staff was\nnot supervising him. She indicated it was difficult to follow the safety plan because\nthey did not have enough staff.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on 3/11/22. Staff 2 took the youth from House\n1 on an outing. On the way back to the house she was the only Samaritas staff in\nthe van at the time and Youth A did not have a one-on-one staff.\nOn-site Inspections:\n 2/1/22 Unannounced: Safety plan put in place. Youth A would have one-on-\none staffing. Because Youth A would not leave his bedroom or house, staff\nwould supervise the bedroom when Youth A and Youth J were in the\nbedroom together. During this visit Youth A was in the living room with staff.\n 2/9/22 Announced: Per PD, Youth A had one-on-one staffing. Youth J was\nmoved out of the bedroom with Youth A but would often sleep in Youth A’s\nbedroom on the floor. When they did this staff sat in the doorway. Youth A\nwas observed in the living room with staff.\n 2/18/22 Unannounced: Per PD Youth A and Youth J were sleeping in the\nsame bedroom together. They could not provide one-on-one staffing for\n10",
    "Youth A and staff could not sit in the youth’s doorway when Youth J and\nYouth A were in the bedroom together. The youth’s bedroom was viewed.\nBlankets were tied to the posts of the youth’s bed so the staff could not see\nthe youth when they were in their beds.\n 2/24/22 Unannounced: Youth J and his bed had been moved from Youth A’s\nbedroom and was in a bedroom in a different hallway. Youth A was sleeping\nin his bedroom. While at the facility staff were not providing one-on-one\nstaffing for Youth A. Consultant observed when one youth walked into Youth\nA’s bedroom. This consultant watched the youth as he entered and took a\nstuffed bear from the bedroom. Later in the day, the two youth were still in\ntheir bedrooms and no staff were supervising the youth. Staff 5 was sitting in\nthe kitchen on a computer.\n 2/25/22 Unannounced: Staff observed supervising the hallway and Youth A\nhad one-on-one staff assigned to him.\n 2/28/22 Unannounced: Staff observed supervising the hallway and Youth A\nhad one-on-one staff assigned to him.\n 3/9/22 Unannounced: Staff 7 and Staff 8 left the house twice leaving unknown\nfederal employees and interpreters alone with the youth. One of the federal\nemployees was performing the one-on-one supervision with Youth A. At one\npoint when Staff 7 and Staff 8 were out of the house a youth left the house\nwithout anyone knowing so this consultant followed him and made sure he\nmade it into the other house where there were staff.\n 3/10/22 Unannounced: At 2:45pm Staff 7 from House 1 left the house and\nwent to House 2 stating she was leaving. At House 1 there was one\nSamaritas staff, Staff 9, supervising all the youth including Youth A who was\nto have a one-on-one staffing. The one-on-one log was completed through\n3pm even though it was not yet 3pm and he did not have a one-on-one staff.\nThe house was very chaotic with youth walking in and out of the house.\n 3/16/22 Unannounced: At House 1 Staff 10 indicated they could not find\nYouth G. None of the staff went to find the youth or notify anyone that the\nyouth was missing. The consultant instructed them to do so. Youth G was\nfound in House 2. In review of the shift expectation log, it was not being\ncompleted per the safety plan.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n E-mail from PD dated 1/30/22 stating Youth A would have one-on-one\nsupervision.\n E-mail from PD dated 2/3/22 stating Youth A would have one-on-one\nsupervision.\n Safety Plan dated 2/25/22.
