The safety plan consisted of split shifts where half of the\nday the Chief Administrator was not in contact with youth and\nperforming administrative duties, and the other half of the day the\nChief Administrator was only monitoring staff and youth and not\nhaving direct contact with youth. It was later confirmed that the\nChief Administrator stopped working at the facility as of\n02/05/2024.\nIncident 1\nYouth A was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at her school. In this\ninterview she alleged the Chief Administrator had pushed Youth C\nduring an incident in the visitation room of the facility. Youth A\nrecalled being downstairs in the visitation room with Youth C at\nnight when they were supposed to be in bed. The Chief\nAdministrator opened the sliding door to the room and asked them\nto go back to bed. Youth A recalled Youth C standing up from the\ncouch and approaching the Chief Administrator. She believed the\nChief Administrator said “Don’t walk up on me” in response to\n2",
    "Youth C, and then pushed Youth C’s forehead. Youth A recalled\nYouth C then falling back onto the couch. Youth A did not believe\nYouth C touched the Chief Administrator while this occurred.\nYouth C was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nrecalled the incident alleged by Youth A. Youth C stated she and\nYouth A were in the visitation room of the facility when they were\nsupposed to be in their bedrooms. Youth C recalled Chief\nAdministrator coming in to the room and asking them to go back to\ntheir rooms. Youth C stated back to her that she was not going to\ndo that. Youth C admitted that she “got up in the face” of the\nChief Administrator only for her to push Youth C on her forehead\nwith the palm of her hand. Youth C stated that she fell backwards\na little bit, but not all the way to the ground. Youth C stated she\nthen walked past the Chief Administrator and that they continued\nto argue, but this was the end of any physical contact between the\ntwo for this incident.\nYouth D was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nstated she believed she witnessed the Chief Administrator punch\nYouth A during the incident in question where Youth A and Youth\nC were in the visitation room, but she could not provide any other\nnotable details. Youth D stated she was on the other side of the\ndining area and saw past the Chief Administrator into the visitation\nroom.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with\nDHHS Worker 1 during an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the\nfacility. She recalled the incident in question where Youth A and\nYouth C were in the visitation room when they should have been\nin their bedrooms. The Chief Administrator stated that she\nentered the room to see both Youth A and Youth C laying on the\nground and the couch, respectively. The Chief Administrator\nrecalled Youth C stood up and stepped towards her. She then\nextended her arm out towards Youth C and could not recall if that\nis when she made contact with Youth C. The Chief Administrator\nstated Youth C then “ran into her” by bumping her shoulder as the\nyouth walked past and then ran out of the room. The Chief\nAdministrator could not recall exactly what was being said at that\nmoment. The Chief Administrator denied ever pushing or hitting\nany youth in the program at any time.\n3",
    "Documents reviewed:\n• An Incident Report regarding Youth C dated 12/18/2023\nwas provided. This was authored by the Chief\nAdministrator. It stated Youth C was refusing to sleep in\ntheir room and were on the couch of the visitation room at\nthe time of the writing of the Incident report. It also\ndescribed Youth C as aggressive and “walking up on staff”\nbut no specific details were written to describe this\nbehavior.\n• Documentation from the personnel file for the Chief\nAdministrator was reviewed. There were no incidents of\ndiscipline in her file. It was noted that a safety plan was put\nin place by the program on 11/06/2023 containing the\nfollowing elements: “Chief Administrator to work 20hrs per\nweek on the floor and remaining hours monitoring staff,\nyouth and all CAPs.”\n• Video footage specific to this incident was requested.\nThere was not any footage that was able to be produced\nthat would show the entrance to the visitation room or the\npoint in time when Youth A and Youth C were in there and\nthe Chief Administrator approached them. Footage that\nwas provided was purportedly from later in the same\nevening and began with the Chief Administrator sitting at\nthe dining room table with Youth C and Staff 1. Youth C\nstood up and exited the dining area to the left of the\nsecurity camera and the Chief Administrator followed her.\nThe Chief Administrator could be heard stating “Come\nhere, [Youth C]” and then she moved to the left out of view.\nThe Chief Administrator then was seen in the left corner of\nthe footage reaching out, and then Youth C came into view.\nThe Chief Administrator pushed Youth C with her right\nhand and Youth C fell out of the bottom of the view of the\nsecurity footage.\nIncident 2\nYouth A was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at her school. During\nthis interview she alleged that Chief Administrator had hit her\nwhile in the car with Youth D. She stated that the three individuals\nwere on their way to the local soup kitchen where the youth\nvolunteer. Youth A recalled she was sitting in the front passenger\nseat, and Youth D was sitting in the back of the van. Youth A\nrecalled Chief Administrator reaching over while driving and\nsmacking Youth A on the side of her face. After they had stopped\nat a gas station, Youth A and Youth D had switched seats. Youth\n4",
    "A recalled the Chief Administrator later reached back and\nattempted to hit Youth A while driving and on the phone.\nYouth C was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\ndescribed a similar incident to Youth A where she alleged the\nChief Administrator slapped her while in the car. Youth C recalled\na time where she got in the car with the Chief Administrator to be\ntransported to school. Youth C stated she and the Chief\nAdministrator were arguing about something she could not recall\nwhen the Chief Administrator reached over and “tapped” her on\nthe cheek. Youth C alternated between referring to this physical\ncontact as a tap and a slap. She stated no one else was in the\ncar with her when this occurred. Youth C could not provide any\nother details or a date when this occurred.\nYouth D was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\ncould not recall the incident in question regarding Chief\nAdministrator using physical contact with Youth A while in the car.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with\nDHHS Worker 1 during an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the\nfacility. She stated she was “not sure” of the specific incidents\nthat were alleged where she had slapped Youth A or Youth C\nwhile in the car. She did state there was one time when she was\ndriving and she felt she had to “wave off” the youth in the car with\nher because they were loud and she was on the phone. The\nChief Administrator could not recall exactly who was in the car for\nthis situation. She did describe something she believed she did\nwith youth often, and this was something that Youth C may have\nbeen referring to. The Chief Administrator stated she often would\nuse her hand to touch beneath the chin of youth she was speaking\nto and lift their heads up. The Chief Administrator stated she did\nthis to teach the youth the importance of making eye contact with\nwhomever they were speaking with. Chief Administrator stated\nshe did not ask for consent to touch youth in this manner when\nshe did this. The Chief Administrator denied ever doing anything\ndisparaging to youth in the program.\nIncident 3\nYouth A was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at her school. She\nrecalled an incident where Staff 2 had pinched her fingers in the\nsliding door to the office of the facility. Youth A stated the sliding\n5",
    "door was closed and may have been locked. She knew at the\ntime that she was not allowed in this room. Youth A recalled Staff\n2 pushing the sliding door backward and in doing so, it pinched\nYouth A’s fingers. Youth A believed this was done on purpose as\na way to stop her from getting into that restricted area. Youth A\ndid not believe she was injured during this incident and did not\nbelieve she received medical attention afterwards. Youth A stated\nshe has not seen Staff 2 since this incident.\nYouth D was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nstated she witnessed Youth A get her fingers pressed behind the\nsliding door to the facility office by Staff 2 when Youth A was\nattempting to break into the room. Youth D did not have any other\nspecifics to provide regarding the incident.\nDuring a video conference on 02/01/2024 DHHS Worker 1 stated\nthat their investigation would not produce any findings.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• An Incident Report regarding Youth A dated 01/07/2024\nwas provided. In it, Youth A was described as attempting\nto break into the staff office of the facility. Staff 2 stated in\nthis report that Youth A attempted to lift up the door to the\noffice, but that Staff 2 held the door down. Youth A then\nstated her fingers were smashed as this occurred. Staff 2\ndocumented this could have occurred and if it did it was an\naccident. It was noted Staff 2 was sent home from work at\nthe time of that incident.\n• Video footage from the date and time of this incident was\nprovided but was not conclusive. The footage showed\nYouth A and Staff 2 in the dining area of the facility but the\npart of the incident where they were at the staff office door\nwas not shown.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed, there was evidence found that supports a rule violation\nfor staff pushing youth during altercations at the facility.\nTechnical assistance provided:\n• Alterations to procedures are needed regarding the\ncommunication and provision of necessary documents for\ninvestigations. One request for documentation is all that is\nnecessary for the program to have an organized and timely\nmanner of returning information and documentation.\n6",
    "• The facility has been advised to find a different service to\nuse for security camera systems. The current system can\nallow for high quality footage and audio recordings but has\nproven to be too difficult for staff to use. Continued use of\nthis system will risk non-compliance when video footage is\nrequired to be provided as well as continued missed\nopportunity to review incidents and use that footage for\ntraining and debriefing purposes.\n• The creation of policy and procedures specific to the use of\nvideo security systems and the access of video clips for the\nuse in debriefing, training and investigative purposes is\nadvised as well.\n• Effort is needed to train and review incident reports for\nnecessary details. It is not sufficient for the program to\nwrite vague descriptions of youth or staff behaviors; all\nnecessary details are required to be outlined in that\ndocumentation to ensure it is accurate.\n• Safety plans instituted by the facility for staff need to be\nmore specific and be able to have the desired effect. If any\nstaff member has allegations involving the physical safety\nof youth or allegations of any verbal altercations with youth,\nit is insufficient to arrange for them to still be in the\npresence of youth expect there to be no interaction\nbetween the staff and youth. In addition, any safety plan\nthat requires a staff member to commit time specifically to\nadministrative tasks should produce measurable outcomes\nfor those tasks.\nConsultation provided:\n• Consideration is required in the area of any physical\ncontact with youth. Even well-intended physical contact\ncan trigger a youth and cause undue stress when it has not\nbeen invited and consented. The physical contact\ndescribed by the Chief Administrator does not reflect a\ntrauma informed approach to communicating with the youth\nthat will be typically placed in this program.\nConclusion Violation Established\n7",
    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms\nof intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(iv) Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative\nreferences to a youth’s background or appearance\nor mental state. Yelling, threats, ridicule, or\nhumiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Chief Administrator made a disparaging comment to Youth C.\nInvestigation Documentation reviewed:\n• Video footage from 12/18/2023 regarding Incident 1 as\ndescribed in the allegations for CCI Rule 400.4158 (1) (a)\n(ii) was reviewed. The footage did not have an exact time,\nbut it was confirmed this occurred after Youth C attempted\nto sleep in the visitation room of the facility, had escalated\nbehavior and then began to calm down. At the beginning of\nthis footage the Chief Administrator was sitting across the\ntable of Youth C in the dining area of the facility, with Staff\n1 standing next to them. Youth C can be seen briefly with a\nlook of upset on her face. The Chief Administrator had\nlooked at Youth C and can clearly be heard stating\n\"Crybaby\" towards Youth C. She then stood up from the\ntable and stated \"C'mon, let's go\" and \"Let's ride\" as they\nwalked toward the left side of the security footage. This is\nwhere the description of pushing by the Chief Administrator\noccurred referenced previously in this report.\nAnalysis Through documentation reviewed there was sufficient evidence\nfound to support a rule violation in that the Chief Administrator\nused derogatory language towards Youth C after an incident had\nde-escalated.\nConclusion Violation Established\n8",
    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4149 Resident nutrition\nSection (1) A licensee shall provide a minimum of 3 nutritious edible\nDescription meals daily unless medically contraindicated and\ndocumented.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth have not been properly fed meals.\nInvestigation Youth A was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at her school. She\nstated she has concerns over the amount of food that youth are\nserved in the program. Youth A stated an example dinner recently\nincluded a cheeseburger (with a bun) and potato salad with a fruit\ncup on the side. She recalled breakfast from earlier that day\nbeing cereal, milk and a packaged yogurt. Youth A stated\ncommon snacks were fruit and fruit snacks. Youth A clarified she\nhad never been served or had seen baby food in the facility but\nhad expressed concerns about food to others and had stated she\nbelieved they were served “baby sized” portions of food.\nYouth B was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nstated she was offered cereal for breakfast that morning but chose\nto only have yogurt. Youth B stated her recent AWOL from the\nfacility was in part caused by not being allowed to eat enough to\nher liking. She described lunches consisting of peanut butter and\njelly sandwiches and chips with fruit on the side. Youth B did state\nthat youth in the program were provided snacks after school and\non the weekends.\nYouth C was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nbelieved they were served “baby sized” portions and she has\nresorted to stealing food because she was hungry. Youth C could\nnot recall much of what is offered to eat because she didn't like it,\nand referred to often eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as\nan alternative. Youth C described restrictive rules on eating, such\nas only being offered a fruit within 30 minutes after dinner if youth\nare still hungry, but not being able to do so after that time.\nYouth D was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nstated youth are served small portions, but she felt like the\nportions were “reasonable.” Youth D commented that a recent\ndinner was a hot dog and a bun with fruit on the side. She stated\n9",
    "that they often eat cereal for breakfast. Youth D also stated they\nusually get snacks but there have been recent times when that did\nnot occur.\nThe facility was toured on two different occasions during\nunannounced visits, on 01/09/2024 and 01/30/2024. The\nrefrigerator, freezer, and storage space in the kitchen and the\nbasement of the building were viewed. On both occasions there\nwas sufficient fresh, frozen, dry and canned food available.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Menus from the facility were documented on two different\noccasions. The meal options and alternatives described on\nthe menus were appropriate and sufficient.\n• Video footage showing six different examples of youth\nsitting down to eat dinner was requested and reviewed. At\nno point did it appear that youth had amounts or portions of\nfood that were insufficient.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed, there was no evidence found that the youth are not\nbeing provided adequate food.\nTechnical assistance provided:\n• The program is advised to redesign their policies and\nprocedures surrounding food. While it was not found that\nyouth are not being fed, it was clear that the restrictive\nnature regarding the timing and scheduling of meals and\nsnacks and the amounts and types of food served was not\nserving the youth well. It was a frequent complaint and\nsource of consternation from youth and is likely providing\nopportunity for conflict when there could be less of it.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the\nDescription direct supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable\ninterval, eye-on checks of residents. The time between the\nvariable interval checks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff members are not supervising the youth at night because they\nfall asleep and do not make the required eyes on checks.\n10",
    "Investigation Youth A was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at her school. She\nrecalled an instance where she and other youth in the program\nwere making an attempt to AWOL, and in doing so she believed\nthat Staff 1 was asleep. Youth A stated this occurred late at night.\nYouth A stated she believed Staff 1 was asleep because she saw\nStaff 1’s eyes closed on one occasion as she quickly moved\nthrough the hallway. Youth A was not sure if she saw Staff 1 after\nthat as she and other youth attempted to AWOL.\nYouth D was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. Youth D\nstated she knew Staff 1 had fallen asleep on a recent evening shift\nbecause Youth D went through the hallway in an attempt to AWOL\nand she saw Staff 1 with her eyes closed. Youth D believed Staff\n1 would have easily noticed her walking towards the stairs\notherwise.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 01/18/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the program. Staff 1\ndenied ever falling asleep while working overnight shifts at the\nprogram. She stated she sometimes sits at the end of the hallway\nwhere all the entrances to the bedrooms are located, and\nsometimes in the “Think Tank” room, which is an all-purpose room\nat the end of that hallway.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Video footage lasting 20 seconds from the evening of\n01/17/2024 was provided and reviewed. The timing of the\nvideo could not be provided by the facility. This showed\nStaff 1 awake and working on documentation while sitting\nin a chair at the end of the hallway. This footage was brief\nand no other video footage was available from the facility\nduring the hours where the youth were asleep.\n• Third shift logs from the evenings several nights in\nDecember and early January were provided and reviewed.\nThere were multiple examples of documentation showing\nexact 15 minute eyes on checks of youth during sleeping\nhours.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and documentation reviewed, there\nwas sufficient evidence found to show that staff have not been\nproviding variable eyes on checks of youth during sleeping hours\nand have been falling asleep during overnight shifts.\nConclusion Violation Established\n11",

While describing one of the incidents that led to\nallegations of inappropriate physical contact between her and\nYouth A, the Chief Administrator stated she was speaking on her\nphone while driving. She stated she does this on occasion while\ntransporting youth. The Chief Administrator could not recall if that\nwas a work related phone call or a personal call. She also\nconfirmed she was aware of newer Michigan laws that do not\nallow hand held cell phones to be used while driving other than\nthrough a car’s audio system and confirmed she was not on\nspeaker phone in front of the youth. The Chief Administrator\nstated she was not sure what the facility policies were regarding\npersonal phone use.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Facility policy last dated 06/27/2023 was reviewed. In a\nsection titled “Transportation” it is stated that “cell phones\nare not to be used while driving vehicles.”\nAnalysis Through an interview with staff and documentation reviewed there\nwas evidence found to show that staff are not following their\npolicies regarding the safe transportation of youth.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2023C0000695 dated 10/05/2023, CAP approved 11/16/2023\n12",
