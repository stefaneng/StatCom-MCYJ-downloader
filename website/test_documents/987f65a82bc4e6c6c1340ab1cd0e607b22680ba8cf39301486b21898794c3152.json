Youth A asked Staff 1\nto move her leg several times. Staff 1 did not move. Youth A then\nnudged Staff 1’s leg. Staff 1 reacted by slapping Youth A in the\nface. Youth A then tried to pick up a chair to throw at Staff 1. Staff\n2 held the chair and stopped Youth A from throwing it. Staff 2\nobserved Staff 1 taking off her jacket as if she were about to fight.\nAdditional staff arrived on the unit and Staff 1 was prompted to\nleave. Staff 1 began walking towards the door. Then Youth A said\nsomething to Staff 1 and she turned around and walked back in\nYouth A’s direction. Staff 1 was prompted to leave again and\nwalked off the unit.\nStaff 1 was interviewed by phone on 1/16/25 by DCWL. Staff 1\nreported she worked with Youth A on 12/17/24. Youth A had a\ndifficult day and made many threats toward Staff 1. Youth A\nthreatened to stab staff with a pen, bit staff, punched staff, and\njumped at them as if she were going to punch them.

Staff 1 stated the kids on this program are\nrelentless with attacking staff, throwing things, spitting, and\nconstantly having a “clear” called. Staff 1 stated the youth need\nmore consequences for their behaviors. Youth know that staff\ncannot do anything to stop their behavior, other than verbal\nredirection.

The agency reported they generally keep staff and youth\nseparated that do not interact well. However, there are times when\nthe schedule does not allow this. Especially in the case of Youth\nA, where she is required to be at a 2:1 ratio. The agency will\ncontinue to be cognizant of these concerns.\nConclusion REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2024C0001153SI dated 3/25/24, CAP approved 4/22/24\nSIR 2024C0001126SI dated 3/12/24, CAP approved 4/22/24\nSIR 2024SIC0001184 dated 3/25/25, CAP approved 4/22/24\nSIR 2024SIC0001304 dated 5/31/24, CAP approved 11/7/24\nSIR 2024SIC0001503 dated 9/4/24, CAP approved 11/8/24\n5",
