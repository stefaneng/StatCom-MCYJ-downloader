    "IV.

CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Coordination with the Building Bridges Initiative began in June 2024.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were three incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing period:\nSpecial Investigation 2023C0000590SI with CAP approval date of 9/22/23 was a result\nof a violation for rule 158 (1a,ii) Intervention Standards and Prohibitions, and rule 112 (2\nand 4a,b) staff qualifications. It was determined a supervisor verbally instigated a youth,\nas well as grabbed, hit and forcibly moved youth on the floor. The supervisor\ndemonstrated an inability to perform duties. As a result, supervisor was terminated from\nemployment, and behavior management refresher training was completed with all staff.\nThe agency completed CAP items and monitoring ended in March 2024.\nSpecial Investigation 2024C0001082SI with CAP approval date of 4/11/24 was a result\nof a violation of rule 158(1a,ii) intervention standards and prohibitions, 127(1) staff to\nresident ratio, and 109(1c) program statement. It was determined the facility was not\nfunctioning in the approved staff to youth ratio, staff used a chokehold on a youth, and\nincident reports were not completed as required. As a result, the agency terminated\nstaff, increased training, decreased available shelter beds, increased supervision of\nstaff, and provided training regarding incident report writing. The agency completed\nCAP items and monitoring ended in August 2024.\nSpecial Investigation 2024C0001139SI with CAP approval date of 4/9/24 was a result of\na violation of rule 158(1a,ii) intervention standards and prohibitions, rule 131 child\nprotection law, rule 162(11) seclusion, 163(5) health status assessment notification\ndebriefing and reporting. It was determined supervisor pushed a youth and held the\nyouth by wrapping their arm around the youth’s neck. Supervisor also held the youth’s\nbedroom door shut in order to prevent exit. Supervisor restrained youth multiple times\nwithout completing incident reports. In addition, staff failed to report the alleged abuse\nthat was witnessed. As a result, the agency terminated the supervisor, behavior\nmanagement became a weekly discussion topic at staff meetings, staff were retrained\n3",
    "on mandated reporting, restraint training as reviewed, prohibition of seclusion was\nreviewed, and incident report writing was reviewed with staff. The agency has taken\nsteps to implement this CAP. However, CAP compliance monitoring is ongoing at this\ntime.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted nine acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility renewal inspection was completed on 7/28/23 and the CAP was\napproved on 8/11/23. The facility was cited for seven violations. Improvement was\nfound in all areas of non-compliance during this review period as there were no\nrepeat violations cited.\nSpecial Investigation 20240000882SI with CAP approval date of 12/15/23 was a\nresult of a violation of rule 159(2g) restraint, reduction, prevention; prohibited\nrestraints. The agency completed CAP items and there have been no repeat\nviolations since that time.\nSpecial Investigation 2024C0001113SI with CAP approval date of 4/1/24 was a\nresult of a violation of rule 142(1e and 1f) health services. The agency completed\nCAP items and there have been no repeat violations since that time.\nSpecial Investigation 2024SIC0001301 with CAP approval date of 8/19/24 was a\nresult of a violation of rule 159(2e) restraints. The agency has taken steps to\nimplement this CAP. However, CAP compliance monitoring is ongoing at this time.\nSpecial Investigation 2024SIC0001424 with CAP approval date of 8/29/24 was the\nresult of a repeat violation of rule 158(1a) intervention standards and prohibitions.\nThe agency has taken steps to implement this CAP. However, CAP compliance\nmonitoring is ongoing at this time.\nSpecial Investigation 2024SIC0001472 with CAP approval date of 8/19/24 was a\nresult of a violation of rule 157(1) behavior management. The agency has taken\nsteps to implement this CAP. However, CAP compliance monitoring is ongoing at\nthis time.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency’s annual financial audit and budget were reviewed. No concerns were\nnoted.\nDuring the interim review process, two special evaluations (2024SIC0001631 and\n2024SIC0001632) were opened regarding financial concerns about Wolverine\nHuman Services, the parent company to Wolverine Center and two other licensed\nprograms. A review of financial documents and interviews with youth and staff\n4",
    "were completed. It was determined the agency was in compliance, as all youth\nneeds continue to be met.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment dated 7/22/24 was reviewed and discussed\non-site. The Chief Administrator (CA) reported successful implementation of the\n2023 renewal CAP. The CA identified ongoing compliance in all areas cited\npreviously. The CA did not identify any barriers or systemic factors that impacted\ncompliance. As a result of the CAP, the agency implemented several techniques to\nmaintain compliance. These actions appear to be successful as there were no\nrepeat violations found during the interim review.\nThe CA reported 34 unplanned discharges during this report period. The\ndischarges were due to truancy, hospitalization, and escalation to a secured\nsetting. The CA reported that truancy continues to be a problem, due to the facility\nnot being a secured setting. The facility has attempted to prevent truancy by\nbuilding relationships with youth, incentives, increased activities, and more frequent\noutings.\nThe CA identified one current challenge being the no eject/reject contract with\nMDHHS. Due to this contract, the facility must accept placement of all youth,\nincluding those with significant behavioral issues. The facility reported several\nincidents of youth attacking and injuring staff. Some steps taken to address this\nconcern were ongoing staff training in de-escalation, overlapping shifts, reviews of\nincident reports, increased frequency of staff meetings, purchasing new radios for\nstaff to communicate when assistance was needed, and a decrease in beds related\nto that contract in order to right size the program. The agency continues to voice\nopposition to the no eject/reject clause of the contract and will continue meeting\nwith MDHHS regarding this concern.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThree staff were interviewed on-site. One staff had been with the facility for over a\nyear and reported being satisfied with their role at the agency. Staff admitted the\njob can be challenging at times. However, they had no suggestions for\nimprovement. The other two staff joined the program within the past 90-days and\nstated their training was helpful and communication with supervisor and\nadministration was informative and supportive. One staff stated they were unsure of\nwhat areas the agency could improve upon. The other staff stated they wished\nyouth had more opportunities to be active in the community, especially during the\nsummer months when school is out.\nAll three staff reported receiving sufficient training and support from supervision\nand administration.\nFour youth were interviewed on-site. All youth reported they felt safe, received\nenough food, and did not have any concerns about the staff. Youth stated they\n5",
    "sometimes felt unsafe because of their peers actions, but not because of staff\nactions. Youth indicate they did not like being in residential treatment but did not\nhave anything specific they disliked about Wolverine Center. When asked about\nanything they would change, youth stated they would like to have more personal\nbelongings, more outings, and different food options.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2023 review. While\nthe building is old and continues to need updating, it was observed to be clean and\nsafe. The bedrooms were found to be a comfortable temperature and had\nappropriate bedding. The kitchen was clean, had a sufficient amount of food, and\nweekly meal menus with a variety of options. Staff and visitation areas were clean\nand appropriate for use. No concerns were identified.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n__ ____________September 17, 2024_______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 25, 2024\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n6"
