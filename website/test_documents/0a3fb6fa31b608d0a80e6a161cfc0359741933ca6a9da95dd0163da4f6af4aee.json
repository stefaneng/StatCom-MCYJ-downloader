    "summary": "A complaint alleged that a youth at the Calumet Center lacked treatment plans, appeared 'drugged' and was not taking medication, and was not attending school. The investigation found the facility in compliance: initial and updated treatment plans were documented and timely, the youth was offered but refused all medication, and he was enrolled but refused to attend school. The report attributes the issues primarily to the youth's refusal to participate in services and notes a family conflict contributed to the perception of him being 'drugged.' Ultimately, the facility was found not culpable for the alleged violations.",
