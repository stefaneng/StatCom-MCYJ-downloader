The last CAP for the facility was written for\nthe 2024 Interim.

Based on\nthe 2024 audit they had non-compliances in R.400.113 and R.400.4155. They\nhave completed training courses to update staff on these requirements. They have\nhad four unplanned releases and identified the trend as youth were outside their\nprogramming modality. Youth had violent and aggressive behaviors and frequent\nAWOLs. The agency continues to grow and learn, completing quarterly internal\nreviews assessing finances, behaviors and youth files.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff did not note any concerns and were well-versed in their role.\nYouth did not voice any concerns. Youth spoke well about program and staff.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is well maintained and decorated nicely. Second floor bedrooms have\nbalconies off the bedroom doors, but doors are locked, and alarms will sound if\nopened. There is a fireplace in the large living room, but it is not used. A workout\nroom is being designed in one of the extra rooms in the house. The agency had\nequipment set up and were finishing the final touches.",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n___________________________________ 05/14/2025\nVenus M.
