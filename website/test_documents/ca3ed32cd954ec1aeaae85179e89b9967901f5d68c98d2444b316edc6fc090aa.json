    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nThe focus of the onsite entrance conference held on 7/20/2023 was numerous\nbarriers the agency faces with adoption. The Chief Administrator reported that the\nagency finds that adoptive applicants have difficulty gathering and providing\nrequired documents in a timely manner to move the home studies towards\ncompletion. Other barriers were identified as the length of time it takes the court\nto process the legal portion of the adoption before finalization. Slow mail delivery\nwas another barrier. However, the administrator reported that they have added a\nhome study document upload button to their website which provides their\napplicants the opportunity to scan and upload their completed documents and this\nprocess works well. The administrator reported that this process serves as a\nsafety net for applicants should their documents get lost in the mail. The\nadministrator also reported that the agency has an online training platform for all\nadoptive applicants.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided their annual budget, a copy of the nonprofit tax return from\nthe previous fiscal year and their annual audit, all was reviewed on site. There\nwere no concerns noted.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed. The staff reported they enjoy working at the agency\nand working with the families. Staff reported no concerns or suggestions for\nimprovement.\nThere were no youth interviews.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has adequate space and equipment. Case files are stored in locked\ncabinets which prevent unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe agency does not have any licensed foster homes or relative placements.\n3",
