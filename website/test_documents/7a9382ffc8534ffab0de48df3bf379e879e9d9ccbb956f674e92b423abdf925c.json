    "11/09/2021 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nAgency worker disclosed private information to youth placed at facility regarding\nanother youth placed there which has had a negative impact regarding interactions\nbetween the two youth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 10/25/2021 I received a copy of a complaint allegation submitted through the\nDCWL on-line reporting system that stated when Youth A was admitted to her\ncurrent placement program, Foster Care Worker (FCW) told her that one of the other\nyouths living in the same placement had been raped by Youth A’s dad and to not tell\nthat youth who her dad was. Youth A keeps bringing this up with the other youth to\nupset her.\nOn 10/26/2021 I interviewed Supervisor by phone. She reported that she was aware\nof the concern that Youths A & B were living together. She reports she did not have\na good memory and couldn’t recall the specifics, but Supervisor and FCW had a\nconversation about the girls being placed together. Supervisor stated that she would\nhave to ask FCW why/how the decision was made to tell Youth A about Youth B’s\nplacement at the facility where Youth A was being placed. Supervisor stated FCW\nhas since told Supervisor that she told Youth A that another youth at the facility\nknew her dad and that she had a negative experience with him, so Youth A should\nnot talk about her dad. Youth A has since been using this information to upset Youth\nB resulting in conflicts between the two. Supervisor reported the director of the\nfacility where the youth are placed stated during a meeting with FCW and Supervisor\nthat she was concerned that FCW had told Youth A about Youth B. Supervisor did\nnot have any concerns with FCW’s statements to Youth A and does not believe\nFCW would violate either girl’s confidentiality.\nOn 10/27/2021 I interviewed Youth A by phone. Youth A stated FCW did not tell her\nanything about any of the other youth placed at the facility. Youth A reported she did\nnot know Youth B or anything about her prior to meeting her at the facility. She\nstated she and Youth B were fighting a lot, but now they get along. She stated\ninitially, she would try to talk to Youth B, but Youth B would ignore her. She stated\nshe would argue with Youth B about “regular stuff, nothing specific.”\nOn 10/29/2021 I interviewed FCW by phone. FCW reported Youth B has claimed\nshe was raped by a man who was Youth A’s father prior to his rights being\nterminated in 2017. She reported Youth B is pregnant and was placed in a mother-\nbaby program. Youth A was in need of a shelter placement and was placed in a\nshelter bed in the same facility in which Youth B was placed. FCW stated prior to\nbringing Youth A to the facility, FCW, Supervisor, and Director had a conversation\nand decided to let the girls know about one another in hopes of avoiding an unsafe\nsituation. She reported this meeting took place on the date Youth A was placed.\nFCW stated she told Youth A there was another youth at the facility who knows\n3",
    "Youth A’s dad and had a negative issue with him. FCW stated Youth A responded\nby stating that Youth A and the other youth would have something in common\nbecause they both hate her dad. FCW stated there were 5-6 girls at the home, and\nshe did not give Youth A Youth B’s name. FCW stated she told Youth B, Youth A’s\nname and who Youth A’s dad was. She again stated the decision to do so was made\nwith Supervisor and Director.\nOn 11/9/2021 I interviewed Director via Teams during which I discussed my\npreliminary findings. Director stated Youth A had been AWOL and upon her return,\nthe agency staff were seeking shelter placement. The Residential Placement Unit\n(RPU) had identified a shelter in the Detroit area, but FCW reached out to a contact\nat the facility where Youth B is placed and asked if they had open shelter beds. She\nthen contacted the RPU and requested that Youth A be placed at the facility where\nYouth B was placed. Director stated that she expressed her concerns about this\nplacement to FCW and Supervisor due to the Youth B alleging that she had been\ntrading sex for drugs from the man who was Youth A’s father prior to his rights being\nterminated and that Youth B alleged that he was the father of the child with whom\nshe is currently pregnant. Director denied ever having a conversation with\nSupervisor or FCW about talking to the youth about one another. She stated she\nhad not heard anything about this concern until she was informed of the complaint\nallegation received by Division of Child Welfare Licensing. She stated that she is\nextremely concerned that a decision was made to violate confidentiality of both\nyouth and that this decision has resulted in conflict between the youth.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12211 Privacy safeguard.\n(1) An agency shall safeguard the privacy of a child and\nhis or her family.\nANALYSIS: FCW told two youth identifying and confidential information\nabout one another.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4",
