    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404 Placement\nSection\nDescription • (3) An agency's placement of a child in a foster home must\nbe consistent with the placement specifications for the\nhome.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Birth Mother’s children were placed with abusive caregivers.\nInvestigation It is noted that MDHHS Worker placement of Youth A and Youth B\non 2/9/2025 were with Foster Parent where the children and\nFoster Parent were familiar with one another as there were no\nrelatives willing to take placement of Youth A and Youth B. A\nthorough assessment of the foster home was completed by\nMDHHS Worker prior to placement of the children.\nBirth Mother was interviewed via telephone on 4/16/2025. She\nreported she was placed in a shelter due to being homeless with\nher three children. She reported while in the shelter, she was\nunder a lot of pressure and feeling depressed because of her\ncircumstances. She said Youth A was not following her directions\nand she hit her 2/8/2024, however not causing any bruising. Birth\nMother admitted she was not respectful to the workers at the\nhomeless shelter and was physically and aggressive with the staff.\nShe said she was informed by the director that she could no\nlonger stay there, and she had to leave. Birth Mother said she\nhad no place to go, and she did not want to live on the streets with\nher children, so she told the staff at the shelter to call MDHHS\nintake unit. She reported that MDHHS Worker came to the shelter\nand took her three children away and informed her Youth A would\nbe going to the hospital to be checked for bruises and injuries.\nShe said the shelter director told her she could no longer live at\nthe shelter, so she left and went to her uncle’s home.\nBirth Mother reported she had recently lost her only support which\nwas her mother, and she had lost all hope and no other family to\ndepend on. She said when MDHHS Worker asked her about\nrelatives that her children could be placed with, she had no one.\nShe said Youth A and Youth B’s Birth Father was homeless as\nwell and she could not ask for his assistance for placement as he\nhad no place to live and was living on the streets.\n2",
    "Birth Mother said somehow MDHHS Worker contacted Youth A’s\nand Youth B’s Birth Father, and he told MDHHS Worker to reach\nout to his ex-girlfriend for placement. She reported this ex-\ngirlfriend became Youth A and Youth B’s current foster parent.\nBirth Father is not the father of Youth C and therefore, Youth C\nwas placed in a different foster home.\nBirth Mother reported Foster Parent is familiar with Youth A and\nYouth B as she has a child with Birth Father and they all, Youth A\nand Youth B included, would frequently visit Foster Parent’s home\nin the past.\nShe reported Foster Parent “is good to” Youth A and Youth B and\nto her knowledge Foster Parent has never mistreated Youth A and\nYouth B. Birth Mother reported she claimed Foster Parent was\nabusing Youth A and Youth B because she felt this was the only\nway to get support and resources from Judson because they do\nnot support her or help her in any way. Birth Mother reported she\nwants Judson to help her get her children back and assist her in\nfinding a home.

Birth Father reported he has not spent the night in the\nFoster Parent home since the children were placed there\n2/9/2025. He reported he did not have any relatives to place his\nchildren with and since he had a child with current Foster Parent\nand Youth A and Youth B used to frequent her home in the past,\nshe was the only other person he could think of that would take\nhis children in and be good to them. Birth Father reported he is\nstill looking for appropriate and stable housing. As of today, Birth\nFather reported he is still homeless and sleeping in different\nplaces. No other information was provided.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed on 4/18/2025 via\nvideo Conference.

Youth A and Youth B denied any abuse or domestic\nviolence in the home as well as unsupervised access to Birth\nFather.\nFCW reported previously, Foster Parent was allowed to supervise\nvisits between Birth Father and Youth A and Youth B.
