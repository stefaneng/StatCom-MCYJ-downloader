    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe agency requested to change their office location from 1305 E Eighth Street,\nSuite B, Traverse City, MI 49686.\nThe Division of Child Welfare Licensing is required to determine compliance with\nthe following rule:\nR 400.12204 Facilities.\n(1) An agency shall provide and maintain sufficient office space, equipment, and\nsupplies to ensure the delivery of services.\n(2) An agency shall have physical office space with a Michigan street address.\nIII. Methodology\nAn on-site inspection was made on March 6, 2019 to 3597 Henry Street, Ste. 102,\nNorton Shores, MI 49441\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe agency has a first-floor office in Norton Shores, MI. The office is located near\nthe corner of Henry Street and Seminole Road.\nWhen you enter the building, the suite is located to the right. Upon entering the\nsuite there is a waiting room area outside of public view on the right and the\nreceptionist area on the left. Past the receptionist area and to the left is the\nkitchen area and board room. The board room can be used for private meetings.\nPast the receptionist area and to the right is the family meeting area, the\nsupervisor’s office and an office that currently houses three foster care workers.\nAt least one more worker could be housed in this office. Across from the\nsupervisor office are two Herman Miller type offices for two more workers, one\nhousing the licensing worker. Both of these could house two workers each if the\nstaff grows larger.\nMoving past the office housing foster care workers is another desk and an area for\nfiles and a copy machine. The filing cabinets are locked and there is plenty of\nroom for more filing cabinets. There is a locked file cabinet for CHRI documents.\nThe cross shredder is located in the receptionist area.\nThe proposed office change to 3597 Henry Street, Ste 102, Norton Shores, MI\n49441 has enough office space, equipment, and supplies to ensure the delivery of\nservices.\n2",
