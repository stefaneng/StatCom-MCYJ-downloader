Two violations\nwere found regarding timely school enrollment and timely treatment plans.\nAs of this review, there were no repeat violations.

No\nfinancial concerns were noted.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment dated 10/24/24 was reviewed and discussed.\nThe assessment indicated the agency was able to successfully implement the\nCAP from the 1/3/24 Interim Review. The agency did not face any barriers during\nCAP implementation.

Chief\nAdministrator reported ongoing monthly monitoring and management review of all\nCAPs.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThree staff were interviewed on-site. Overall, staff reported that they enjoyed\nworking with the youth and felt supported by the agency. Staff indicated they\nstruggled with youth behaviors at times, but felt they had sufficient training and\nsupport from supervisors. However, staff reported feeling overwhelmed with\nmandated overtime and extra shifts, due to being short staffed. Some staff felt that\nnew employees were not well prepared for what the job entailed. Staff also\nreported feeling that they needed more ‘real time’ information on youth to better\nassist them when they start their shift.",
    "Three youth were interviewed on-site. Overall, youth stated that they felt safe and\nsupported by staff. Youth indicated they receive enough food, hygiene supplies,\nand felt that the school program was helpful to reach their goals. However, youth\nalso stated they did not feel there was a good reward system. This was due to\npeers acting out and ruining activities for the whole group, or peers acting out and\nstill getting rewards. Some youth reported they did not enjoy the food at the facility\nand felt that it was not cooked the way they liked it. Youth reported they would like\nmore independent living skills and outings. Staff often plan things, but peer\nbehavior disrupts the plans.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe facility was observed and found to be clean and safe. There was some wear\nand tear to the buildings, as a result of youth acting out and kicking doors or\npicking at walls and trim. The agency has a full-time maintenance staff that\naddresses these issues in a timely manner. Youth were found to have adequate\nbeds and bedding. No concerns were noted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n_ ______________November 26, 2024____________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 27, 2024\n___________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager"
