    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there\nare additional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility\nis in compliance with all additional ISEP requirements except for the following:\nThis is a non-contracted facility and therefore not required to follow ISEP.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a MDHHS Contract/Policy violation. Please\nnote that there are additional MDHHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not\nbe included in section 1. The facility is in compliance with all additional MDHHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nThis is a non-contracted facility and therefore not required to follow MDHHS policy.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility did not require technical assistance during this review.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nOn 5/18/18 special investigation 2018C0212012 was initiated (CAP approved\n1/28/19). This investigation was initiated due to an allegation that a staff member was\nallowing residents of the home to have girls over and engage in sexual activity in the\nhouse. The facility was found to be in violation rule R400.4109 (1,c) Program\nStatement and R400.4112 (1,a) Staff Qualifications. Additional findings were cited\ndue to confirming that the staff in question was also placed on central registry in\n2014. This was missed by the agency, due to the staff being hired in an adult program\nwhere a central registry check is not completed; then transferring to the children’s\nprogram in 2018, without the ‘new hire’ process being completed. The facility was\ncited for Staff Qualifications, Rule 400.4112. Since that time, the agency has\nterminated this person’s employment. The agency has also implemented a process\n1",
    "for all staff transferring into the children’s program, to ensure that proper clearances\nare provided. Policies regarding visitors and supervision of residents at the house\nhave also been updated. The facility continues to follow their CAP and there have\nbeen no further incidents.\nOn 6/3/19 special investigation 2019C0212032 was initiated (CAP approved 8/29/19).\nThe investigation was initiated after it was reported that a resident assaulted another\nresident during sleeping hours, without staff knowledge. The facility was found to be\nin violation of R 400.4127 staff-to-resident ratio. Per the CAP, the facility implemented\na policy requiring staff to remain in the upstairs hallway during sleeping hours, to\nensure residents remain in their bedrooms. The facility reports that they continue to\nutilize this policy and there have not been any additional incidents.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. It is recommended that the facility continue on their regular license.\nFebruary 6, 2020\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 14, 2020\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n2"
