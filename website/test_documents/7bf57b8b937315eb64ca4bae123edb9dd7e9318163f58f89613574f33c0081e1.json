An\nagency shall give a copy to and review the parent-\nagency treatment plan with the parent or parents\nand foster parents. The agency must inform the\nparent or parents and foster parent that the\ninformation in the parent-agency treatment plan\n2",
    "and any other information about the child and the\nchild's family is confidential.\nTwo of three foster care case records reviewed did not show documentation that the\ncase plan was developed with the parent/parents and/or foster parents. PATP's\nwere not signed, dated or check marks checked.\nCPA Rule 400.12605 Adoptive family evaluation\n• (1) An agency social service worker shall\ncomplete a written adoptive evaluation within 90\ndays of the family signing an adoption application\nand prior to approving a family for adoption.\nOne of three adoption case records reviewed did not complete a written evaluation\nwithin 90 days. The report was seven months late.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nINTERIM 24, CAP Approved 6/17/2024\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Technical Assistance was not requested or required.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Consultation was not requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance:\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The CAP\nsubmitted was in response to the 2024 renewal inspection completed on\n06/10/2024 and the CAP was approved on 06/17/2024. The agency was cited for\n3 violations, 1 of the violations is a repeat this year. The repeated violation\n3",
    "(400.12605 -1) indicates that additional corrective action planning is needed to\nshow reduction of this violation.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nChief Administrator (CA) discussed barriers that impeded the agency this year\nduring the exit conference held on 8/26/2025. CA reported that the largest barrier\nto ensuring contract compliance has been an ongoing pattern of turnover\nthroughout all levels and some resignations being abrupt. This turnover includes\ndirect case managers, foster care supervisors, and the program director. Each\nresignation results in case management issues that directly affect the agency's\ncontract compliance. Continuity of care is directly affected and timeliness dictated\nby policy is affected when trained staff leave the agency and the case is taken on\nby a worker unfamiliar with the case. The agency has been unable to fill the open\nposition for foster care supervisor, and this has affected review of the agency's\nprevious CAP, causing non-compliance.\nCA reported areas of the previous CAP that had positive impacts on the agency's\nprocedures included utilization of the Microsoft calendar to track due dates,\nmonthly trainings surrounding previous licensing violations, utilization of the\nMiSACWIS checklist, and weekly supervisor and team meetings in which the Book\nof Business as well as the agency's database are reviewed to provide additional\ndue date oversight for direct staff.\nFinancial Overview:\nReviewed the independent agency auditor’s report dated December 30, 2024, and\nthe agency annual financial report. There were no financial concerns identified.\nStaff Interviews:\nStaff were interviewed onsite 8/26/2025. Staff interviewed were compassionate\nabout working for the agency citing the assistance and support they receive from\ntheir program director, supervisors and their co-workers. They feel the\nenvironment is good to work in but retaining the staff is very difficult. The concerns\nshared was a lack of support from upper management and the way upper\nmanagement communicates with the staff. The staff reported some suggestion for\nstaff morale from upper management is to provide the staff with tokens of\nappreciation, certificates, and fun activities such as lunch and learn. Staff feel this\nmight assist in retaining staff and increase the staff morale.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through:\nThe agency has the space and equipment needed to fulfil job requirements. The\nfiles are stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.\n4",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were three safety alerts.\nSafety Alert 1:\nConcern: Caregivers did not have an operable smoke detector near sleeping\nspaces. Smoke detector observed beeping; Cleaning supplies are accessible to\nchildren. Dog feces in the basement, bedroom door for the foster children is not\ninstalled properly and windows are missing screens.\nResolution: Caseworker/Program Manager and Supervisor visited the home on\n05/28/2025. The home was untidy with garbage scattered around the home. The\nworkers instructed Caregivers to clean up the dog feces in the basement which was\nstill present. Caregivers picked up all feces. Workers moved all cleaning supplies\nfrom under the bathroom and kitchen sink and placed them temporarily in the kitchen\ncabinet above the sink. Workers installed a new smoke detector next to the children's\nbedroom. Caregivers report that they are moving approximately June 10. The door\nhas been placed against the wall and the Caregivers was advised not to use it as the\nchildren would not be able to move it in case of a fire or emergency. The caregiver\nagrees to ensure that all windows remain closed until the agency can provide kiddie\nlocks.\nUpdated on 05/29: the two foster children were placed outside of the home in safety\nplan with the caregiver’s parents from 05/29 to 06/02. Over the weekend, the\ncaregivers were able to hang the bedroom doors on hinges and place window alarms\non the windows that did not have screens. The alarms will go off if any of the\nwindows are opened to alert the caregivers that there is an urgent safety matter at\nrisk.\nSafety Alert 2:\nConcern: Caregiver did not have an operable carbon monoxide detector in the\nhome. There is a door that is not hinged properly in the kitchen area and there is a\nbedroom where the door is not hinged properly and can't be opened all the way.\nResolution: On 7/7/25, Licensing worker contacted the Caregiver and requested\nproof that the carbon monoxide detector was working and that the door to the\nbedroom was working properly. Caregiver agreed to send the licensing worker proof\nof the working carbon monoxide detector and the door and to schedule a repair for\nthe door to the laundry room with the loose hinges. Caregiver sent two videos on\n7/9/25 that showed the batteries had been replaced in carbon monoxide detector\nand it was working properly and the other showed that the bedroom door could be\nopened and closed. Once the laundry room door has been repaired, the agency will\nobtain proof. Caregiver provided the agency with a video verifying the bedroom door\n5",
    "opening and closing and the carbon monoxide detector working. Videos are not able\nto be included in the alert.\nSafety Alert 3:\nConcern: Caregiver had no operable smoke detector on each level of occupancy.\nOne of the bedrooms was not viewed due to the caregiver indicating it was her\nbedroom and the door was locked. The safety of the room could not be assessed.\nResolution: On June 13, 2025, Program Director arrived at the Caregiver’s home and\ncompleted a walkthrough of the entire home. The basement was viewed which\ncontained storage items and no safety concerns. Program Manager provided a new\nsmoke detector near the stairs and laundry room in the basement.\nThe door through the children’s bedroom which was locked was opened and viewed.\nIt contained storage items and clothes and a twin bed underneath the items. No one\nsleeps in this room. The family was able to pick the lock as they had lost the key. No\nsafety hazards were observed. The children's bedrooms were both appropriate. The\ndual smoke detector/carbon monoxide detector between the bedrooms was tested\nand working. Additional another smoke detector was provided to place above the\nentryway to the kitchen. The top floor of the home is the primary bedroom and has\nanother living and eating area. A new smoke detector was placed and tested above\nthe walkway into the primary bedroom. No safety hazards were observed.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n9/15/2025\n________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n9/15/2025\n_________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n6"
