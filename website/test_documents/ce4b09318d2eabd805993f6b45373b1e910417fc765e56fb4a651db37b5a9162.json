She reported Youth A called\nher and wanted to talk about staff who still worked at the facility.\nYouth A informed Complainant 1 that Staff 1 would allow Youth A\nto vape with staff during trips in the facility van. Youth A reported\nStaff 1 was engaged in this behavior and Youth A described Staff\n1 as “really cool”. Complainant 1 who does not work in the\nprogram waited until meeting with a facility supervisor before\ncalling in the report because she was unsure if she needed to\nreport the allegations since Youth A had left the program in\nSeptember 2023. Youth A informed Complainant 1 this vaping\ntook place several times in the van.\nAdministrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n3/15/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nand provided a safety plan that had been developed which\nincluded Staff 1 having no one-to-one contact with youth until this\ninvestigation is completed. She reported Complainant 1 received\nthe allegations from Youth A during a recent phone call from\nYouth A who was in the program from 6/5/2023 until 9/23/2023.\nAdministrator was going to review outing logs and provide a copy\nto determine if Staff 1 had transported Youth A for an outing. She\nreported Staff 1 generally transports youth to school or doctor’s\nappointments. Administrator was interviewed again, face to\nface at the facility on 3/18/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. She reported Staff 2 is the type of staff who holds others\naccountable, so other staff don’t share things with him. She\nreported she will send Staff 2 into situations that required strict\noversight and supervision.\n2",
    "Youth A was interviewed face to face at the facility Youth A is\ncurrently lodged on 3/18/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. Youth A reported liking all of the staff at the facility in\nquestion and “really loved” Staff 1. Staff 1 was easy to talk with\nand understood Youth A. Youth A reported no staff gave her a\nvape while at the facility, but Youth A did witness Staff 1 vaping.\nStaff 1 would not allow the youth to vape. Youth A reported\nbelieving other staff also vape because Youth A would observe\nthe shape of a vape in staff’s pockets. Youth A observed smoke\ncoming out of the sleeve of Staff 3 during a walk and believed\nStaff 3 was vaping because of this smoke. Youth A reported never\nvaping while at the facility and she was unable to remember telling\nanyone that she had vaped or had vaped with Staff 1 while at the\nfacility. Youth A reported never vaping in a van and didn’t recall\ntelling someone of this allegation. Youth A identified Youth C who\nis no longer at the facility but did get vapes from school and bring\nthe vape to the facility. Youth A reported youth would hide a vape\nin the family bathroom at the Y-center and share the vape\nbetween youth when changing to go swimming.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/18/2024\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported vaping but\nnever around any youth especially when transporting youth. She\nreported once she dropped the vape in the presence of a youth,\n(she was unable to identify) which caused her great\nembarrassment. This occurred within the first couple of weeks she\nbegan employment at the facility. Youth A reported observing the\nshape of a vape in her pocket, so Staff 1 has not carried a vape\non her person since then. Staff 1 denied giving or sharing a vape\nwith any youth in the program on campus or off campus. Staff 1\nreported Youth C had a vape during a transport, but Youth C\nscared her, so she informed other staff (she was unable to recall\nwhich staff) when returning to campus. Staff 1 believes the other\nstaff (unable to recall which staff) did speak to Youth C about\nYouth C’s behaviors, but she had no evidence to support this\nbelief.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n3/18/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nshe stopped vaping, and she previously received the vape pens\nfrom friends at school. She reported staff have not given any\nyouth a vape since last summer (2023) and Staff 1 never had\nanything to do with staff giving vapes to youth. Youth B never\nwitnessed Staff 1 vaping. The primary youth who engaged in\nvaping was Youth C and the staff providing the vape was Staff 4.\nThis issue was investigated (2024C0001118SI). Another staff\n3",
    "involved was Staff 5 and this was also investigated\n(2024C0001118SI).\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/18/2024\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. He denied having any\nknowledge of youth or staff vaping at the facility. He denied ever\nobserving any staff or youth vaping. He reported having no\nconcerns about Staff 1.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/18/2024\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported hearing\nabout staff vaping on campus and incidents with staff and youth\nvaping but never witnessed this activity. He was unable to provide\nany names because he only heard rumors. He reported being on\nnumerous outings but never witnessing any vaping by staff or\nyouth during the outing. He reported if a youth began to talk about\nvaping, he would shut the conversation down because “you can’t\nhave that going on”.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nD.A. Blodgett ST. John’s safety plan Re: Staff 1 dated\n3/15/2024. This document outlines the changes in Staff 1’s daily\nwork activities for the current timeframe. Starting on 3/15/24, Staff\n1 is not to have any 1:1 contact with youth, outside of camera\nview, until further notice.

    "Analysis Based upon interviews and written documentation there is no\nevidence that supports Staff 1 engaged in the activity of vaping in\nfront of Youth A or sharing a vape with Youth A. Issues of youth\nand staff vaping has been addressed in prior special\ninvestigations.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.
