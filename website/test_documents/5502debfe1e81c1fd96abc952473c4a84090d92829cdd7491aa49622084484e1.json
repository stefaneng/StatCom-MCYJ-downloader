EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP submitted by the agency was in respnse to the 10/10/2023 licensing renewal\ninspection report and was approved on 10/28/2023. That CAP addressed 7\nviolations, none of which were repeated during this inspection. The agency has\ncorrected their non-compliances in all of the areas addressed in that CAP. Of the\nthree violations established during this inspection, all were also found in 2021;\nhowever, two of those violations were isolated incidents during this inspection. The\nagency has seen a reduction in overall violations as well as a reduction in\nindividual instances of violation over the past two years.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency Director, who is the assigned chief administrator, is currently on leave.\nThe agency Program Manager is currently acting as Director as well as Program\nManager and completed the Chief Administrator assessment. He identified several\nareas in which prior CAP implementation has improved compliance. He did\nidentify a barrier with compliance attributed to staff performance that required\nleadership to provide additional coaching and oversight as well as disciplinary\naction as staff needed guidance regarding the difference between conducting a\nhome visit with the youth and foster parents every calendar month as opposed to\nevery 30 days.\nFinancial Overview\nNo applicable.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe staff interviewed all reported feeling supported by co-workers and\nmanagement and did not express any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to perform the\nrequired job functions. The CHRI, adoption, and case files are stored within\n5",
    "lockable cabinets to prevent unauthorized access and destruction. The files are all\nmaintained within the office, which can only be accessed through two locked\ndoors. Any non-employees who enter the office must be escorted by an employee,\nfurther preventing any unauthorized individuals from having access to confidential\nfiles that may be in use by staff out of their stored locations.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified 3 safety concerns as follows:\nSafety Alert 1: Relative home had a pool and no safety alarms or rescue\nequipment.\nResolution: The agency provided the family with door alarms and rescue\nequipment. The agency also provided DCWL with the pool safety plan which had\nbeen put into place upon placement of the youth.\nSafety Alert 2: Relative caregiver refused to meet with the DCWL Analyst\nResolution: The agency visited the home on 8/7/2023 and verified safety of the\nyouths and the home.\nSafety Alert 3: Relative home had a pool without filtration, a barrier, door alarms, or\nrescue equipment.\nResolution: The agency provided photographs of the pool taken down as well as a\nwritten agreement by the relative to sign a safety plan if the pool is to be put back\nup.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nOctober 12, 2023\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 13, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
