The agency maintained the child in a\nfoster home placement until 2/3/22, despite MDHHS no longer having jurisdiction.\nChief Administrator\nOn 2/16/22 the Chief Administrator (CA) and program manager were contacted by\nphone and informed of the investigation. A message was left, and a follow-up email\nwas sent. The administrator responded and reported the supervisor for this case is\nno longer with the agency. However, another supervisor could speak to the case and\nwould be available for face-to-face interviews at the agency, with the foster care\nworker. On 2/22/22 while at the agency for face-to-face interviews, the CA attended\nvirtually via Teams. CA reported reviewing the order when it was received on\n1/31/22 and being in agreement with using the foster parent like an alternative\n2",
    "caregiver, due to the weather and other factors that delayed return. Parent 1 and the\nfoster parent were both in agreement with the move date of 2/3/22. On 3/11/22 a\nfollow-up conversation occurred via Teams. The CA reported she was not present\nfor the conversations with Parent 1 or Foster Parent. However, she believed staff\nknew the expectations around return home planning. She also indicated that staff\nare aware an FTM can be completed after return home when a child is ordered\nhome unexpectedly.\nFoster Care Worker\nOn 2/22/22 an interview was conducted at the agency with the assigned Foster Care\nWorker (FCW). FCW reported there was a court hearing on 1/27/22 where it was\ndetermined the family would receive Intensive Neglect Services (INS) to assist with\nreunification. However, reunification was not ordered at that time. On 1/31/22 a\nmeeting occurred to discuss the case plan and referral for INS. The referral to INS\nwas completed and submitted after the meeting. Later that afternoon, approximately\n4:00pm, the agency received a court order to return Child A to the home of his\nparent (Parent 1). The order was signed on 1/31/22. The agency was not expecting\nthis return home order so quickly. A Family Team Meeting had not occurred to plan\nfor the return home. Additionally, due to the lateness of the day and a severe storm,\nit was determined the child would not be transported that night. FCW clarified Parent\n1 also had to work that night and needed some additional time to set up school and\ndaycare before Child A returned home. Contact occurred with the foster parent, who\nagreed to maintain the unpaid placement until Thursday, 2/3/22. Parent 1 did not\nexpress any concerns with this plan.\nSupervisor\nOn 2/22/22 an interview was completed at the agency with Supervisor. Supervisor\nclarified that INS is a reunification program, which keeps the court case open for\nsupervision and services, but closes the agency/DHHS case. Supervisor reported\nthere are two other children in this family that remain in care, therefore the family’s\ncase is open, despite Child A’s case responsibility ending on 1/31/22. Supervisor\nindicated that due to all parties being in agreement that return home could physically\noccur on 2/3/22, they viewed the foster parent as “babysitting” to assist Parent 1.\nThe foster parent understood this was not an official placement and she would not\nbe paid for February 1-3. Foster Parent (FP) and Parent 1 had a good relationship\nand agreed giving Child A time to pack and say goodbye to people at school would\nbe beneficial.\nFoster Parent\nOn 3/8/22 a phone interviewed occurred with Foster Parent (FP). It was confirmed\nthere was a court order dated 1/31/22, but Child A did not return home until 2/3/22.\nFoster Parent stated she was informed via text from FCW. FCW set a date with FP\nto transport Child A on 2/3/22 to return home. FP stated she was not sure why that\ndate was chosen, and she did not receive any paperwork about Child A leaving until\nafter he moved. FP clarified that she was informed of the return home on Monday\n1/31/22 and agreed to transport Child A home on Thursday 2/3/22, understanding it\n3",
    "was no longer considered a placement. FP denied having any contact with Parent 1\nabout the situation.\nParent 1\nOn 3/8/22 a phone interview occurred with Parent 1. Parent 1 reported that during\nthe 1/27/22 court hearing, there was no discussion about a return home date. Parent\n1 participated in a meeting on 1/31/22, but return home was not discussed. On\nWednesday 2/2/22, Parent 1 was informed Child A would be returned to her care.\nParent 1 stated that she offered to pick Child A up, but FCW stated FP would be\ntransporting him on 2/3/22. Parent 1 stated that she did not ask for a delay and she\nwas ready for Child A to return home right away. Parent 1 reported being upset\nabout the delay but did not report anything as she was overall happy with the agency\nand wanted to “go with the flow”.\nDocuments reviewed\n Court order signed 1/27/22- no mention of return home.\n Court order, Ex Parte General Order signed 1/31/22 indicated:\no The (Child A) is placed with his mother, (Parent 1).\no The commitment to the MDHHS is hereby rescinded.\no The parents and child are committed to the INS program under the\nsupervision of JCO.\n Case contacts in MiSACWIS\no 1/31/22- from FCW to Parent 1 (prior to court order being received to\nreturn home) FCW informed Parent 1 that INS meeting occurred and\ndetermined Child A would be staffed by INS, under her. Parent 1 was\nhappy and asked what she had to do. FCW explained the process and\nthat Parent 1 would need to get Child A registered for school, set up\ndaycare, and fill his medication.\no 1/31/22 from FCW to FP. FCW text FP to request Child A be transported\nas soon as possible. FP informed she would no longer be paid for\nplacement. FP stated that Thursday would work for transport. A time was\nset with the FP.\no 1/31/22 text from FCW to Parent 1. FCW informed Parent 1 they were\nplanning to place Child A in her care on Thursday. Parent 1 agreed and\ndiscussed what she need to do prior to his arrival, such as daycare.\no 2/2/22 text from FCW to FP. FCW informed FP the agency could not\ntransport Child A due to the weather. FP stated she would transport Child\nA.\no 2/2/22 text from FCW to Parent 1. FCW notified Parent 1 of an FTM that\nday. Parent 1 confirmed the time for return home on 2/3/22.\n TDM 1105 report dated 2/3/22: FCW recommends Child A return home; case\naccepted by INS program; FP planned to transport Child A to Parent 1’s home.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-15 Case Closing\nCaseworkers are required to continue and document all case\nmanagement activities and services to the child and family until\na written court order is received by the department ending the\ndepartment's supervision of the child. Caseworkers do not have\nthe authority to require the child and/or family to continue\nparticipating in case management activities and services after\ndismissal of court jurisdiction, even if the written order has not\nyet been received by the department.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation of this policy as the court ended\njurisdiction on 1/31/22 and the agency did not return the child\nhome until 2/3/22. Policy states the agency cannot continue\ncase management services after the court order. Therefore, a\ndelayed return home, facilitated by the agency is not permitted.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\n_ _______________March 14, 2022_________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 15, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
