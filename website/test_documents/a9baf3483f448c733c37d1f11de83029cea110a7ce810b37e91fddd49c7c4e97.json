The agency was cited for twenty-five violations, four of which were\nrepeats from the 2023 review. During the current review the overall number of\nviolations decreased to fourteen. Of the fourteen violations, only three were repeat\nviolations from 2024. It was noted the number of occurrences for each violation\nalso decreased this year. The agency will need to develop a corrective action plan\nto address the new and repeat violations.\nSpecial Investigation 2024SIC0001433 was completed on 7/26/24 and the CAP\nwas approved on 11/1/24. As a result of the investigation, the agency was cited\nregarding Rule 400.12310 (3, a). It was determined that during the process of\ncompleting a licensing assessment for a relative caregiver, the child's biological\nfather was identified as a registered sex offender and used the relative caregiver's\nhome address as his own. In the home study, the agency did not address this\nissue. Although it was determined the father was not living in the relative home, a\nviolation was found as the agency did not assess the reported sex offender results\nin the home study. CAP follow-up occurred on 12/1/24 and 2/7/25. The agency\nsuccessfully completed the CAP, and it was closed on 2/24/25.

As a result of the investigation, a 1st provisional license\nwas issued.

The\nagency was also cited regarding Rule 400.12503 (2j) as the agency did not have a\nspecific birth plan developed for the pregnant IL youth. CAP follow-up occurred\nwith the agency 4/28/25 and 7/21/25. The agency successfully implemented all\nCAP action steps, and the CAP was closed on 8/14/25. During the current renewal\nevaluation, there were no repeat violations found in this area.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) Assessment dated 7/16/25 was reviewed and\ndiscussed. The agency reported several staffing changes since the 2024 review.\nHowever, the CA indicated the team has been able to work together to maintain a\nstrong structure during these changes.\nThe CA reported the agency has consistently met their key performance indicators\nduring this review period. The agency has also effectively implemented the CAPs\nfrom the 2024 interim review and the 7/26/24 and 12/30/24 special investigations.\nThe CA reported new policies and procedures, increased communication, and\nfollow-up have helped improve compliance in the areas identified in the CAPs.\nThe CA reported very few unplanned removals during this review period. One pre-\nadoptive placement ended as recommended by the agency and Michigan",

The agency reported they have worked closely with the local MDHHS\noffices to communicate well and prevent unplanned YAVFC moves in the future.\nFinancial Overview\nThere were no financial concerns identified based on the review of the agency's\n2025 budget and 12/31/23 financial audit. The agency's 2024 financial audit is in\nprogress.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. Both staff reported they enjoyed their jobs and\ndid not have concerns or suggestions for improvement at the agency. Both staff\nstated their coworkers and supervisors are very kind, supportive, helpful, and work\nwell together. Staff described administration as being invested and engaging with\nstaff.

The building\ncontinues to be sufficient for staff and client needs, with meeting and visitation\nspace. There is a cross shredder for disposal of documents and locking storage\nfor files and confidential information.\nVII. AGENCY ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n_ _____________August 15, 2025_______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 18, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager",
