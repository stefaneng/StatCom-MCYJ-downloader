Youth A\nhad a grip on Staff 1 and another staff intervened in an attempt to\ntry free Staff 1. Staff 1 tried to free herself and hit Youth A in the\nhead.\nInterviews:\nInvestigation On 6/26/2025 I spoke with Program Director (PD) about this\ncomplaint by telephone. PD did not witness the incident. Staff 1\ntelephoned her and reported the incident. PD said she went to the\nindependent living (IL) house to address the matter. PD did not\nspeak with Youth A about the incident. When she arrived onsite\nthe police were there; the police took Youth A to the Genesse\nCounty Juvenile Justice Center.\nPD reported Quality Representative was conducting an\ninvestigation of the incident. She reported there is an incident\nreport and video footage, and she reviewed both. She reported\nfrom what she observed in the video footage, it showed Youth A\nhit Staff 1 in the face and Staff 3 got in between Youth A and Staff\n1 to stop the attack. PD reported she was informed by Staff 3\nthat Youth A had a good hold on Staff 1, so Staff 3 was trying to\nseparate the two. I asked PD from her view of the video footage\nwhether she observed any deliberate hitting or striking by Staff 1\nonto Youth A; or if any such actions appeared accidentally. PD\n2",
    "reported from what she could see, and make out from the video\nfootage, it appeared that Staff 1 was trying to free herself from\nYouth A’s grip.\nPD reported Staff 1 has been with the agency a number of years.\nShe reported the Human Resource Director can provide me with\ninformation related to Staff 1 ‘s date of hire and whether Staff 1\nhas any previous disciplinary actions.\nOn 6/30/2025, I interviewed Quality Representative (QR) by\ntelephone about the allegations. QR reported conducting an\ninvestigation of the incident and viewing the video footage of the\nincident. She stated from the video footage she saw Staff 1\nstanding with her arms folded and then Youth A attacking Staff 1.\nQR reported that Staff 1 put her hands up to keep Youth A from\nhitting her again, but Youth A latched on to Staff 1’s breast. QR\ndid not clarify whether she observed the prior act from the video or\nwhether Staff 1 reported that. QR reported she could not see from\nthe video footage Staff 1 hitting Youth A, but Staff 1 told her she\nhit Youth A on the top of the head, thinking that would cause\nYouth A to let her go. QR said Staff 1 showed her how she hit\nYouth A on the head, which was with the hand and not a hard\naction. QR reported that according to her interview with the\nyouths who were on the scene, Youth A was beating Staff 1 up.\nQR reported it appeared that Staff 1 took a beating before she\ntried to do something to free herself; and Staff 3 could not free\nher. QR reported being unaware as to whether Youth A reported\nbeing hit or having any bruises. QR said, Staff 1 disclosed verbally\nand in writing to having bruises on her face and breast.\nQR reported the protocol for incidents like this (attacks or\nassaults) is to call for assistance. QR said Staff 1 did that. QR\nreported staff are also to remove themself from the situation and\ncall the police. QR reported Staff 3 came to assist Staff 1 in\ngetting free to leave; and another staff member called the police.\nQR reported the staff followed agency policy. QR added she saw,\nand assessed that Staff 1 was preparing to leave before the attack\nby Youth A. Staff 1 had gathered her things to leave, and Youth A\nwas in her way saying, “I have you on my 1”, which QR reported\nmeant “I’m going to fight you”. Reportedly, Youth A was upset\nthat she and another youth had been denied a pot to cook, which\nshe and the other youth knew was against the rules because they\nare not allowed to cook after 10:00PM, which was the case. QR\nsaid it was reported by Staff 2 Staff 1 tried to avoid Youth A, but\nYouth A followed her down the hall to the office and kicked on the\n3",
    "door until it opened; and the assault ensued thereafter. QR\ndenied conducting any prior investigations on Staff 1.\nOn 6/30/2025 I interviewed Human Resource Director (HRD) by\ntelephone. HRD reported information related to Staff 1 not the\nalleged incident. She reported Staff 1’s date of hire as 8/16/2021.\nStaff 1 was hired in another agency program, transferred to their\nresidential program, Queen of Angels until being laid off on\n10/4/2024; and then rehired on 10/14/2024 in her current position\nwithin this independent living program. HRD described Staff 1 as a\n“good employee”. She reported no disciplinary actions or misuse\nof agency procedures for Staff 1. She reported that due to this\nincident and the allegations, Staff 1 was suspended pending the\ninvestigation.\nOn 7/11/2025 I interviewed Youth B onsite at the Holy Cross\nindependent living (IL) home. Youth B said approximately 2-3\nweeks ago, Youth A and Staff 1 were fighting each other. She said\nStaff 3 was holding Youth A back, but Youth A kept swinging at\nStaff 1. Then Staff 1 swung at Youth A’s and hit Youth A's face\narea. Youth B reported before the fight Staff 1 had let her cook\npast the 9:00PM cut off time; and when Youth A asked to cook\nsomething, Staff 1 did not allow it. Youth B said Youth A got mad,\nand wanted to talk about not being allowed to cook, but Staff 1\nswung the office door closed on Youth A. Youth B admitted she\ndid not see the latter and she only heard about that part. She said\nthe fight took place in the front entrance way of the IL home, which\nshe reported is away from the prior stated office. Youth B was not\nsure how Youth A and Staff 1 got to the entrance location. She\ndenied ever experiencing a problem with Staff 1 or witnessing one\nbetween Staff 1 and Youth A, or Staff 1 and any other youth prior\nto this incident with Youth A. Youth B reported seeing a bruise or\nbruises on Staff 1’s face, but did not see any bruises on Youth A\nafter the incident.\nOn 7/11/2025 I interviewed Youth C onsite at the Holy Cross\nindependent living (IL) home. Youth C said approximately 2-3\nweeks ago, she had asked to cook something after 9:00pm and\nwas told no. She reported Youth A went to talk to Staff 1; Staff 1\nslammed the door in Youth A’s face and Youth A broke the office\ndoor. Youth C said she was in the hallway during the time the door\nwas slammed by Staff 1 and broken by Youth A, and She\nadmitted she did not witness either. She reported hearing Youth\nA hitting the door repeatedly and walking away. Youth C said\nafter Youth A walked away, Staff 1 walked from the dining room\ntoward the front door, and as Staff 1 was walking Youth A told\n4",
    "Staff 1 to stop looking at her. Youth C reported Staff 1 did not\nrespond to Youth A, and it was all Youth A asking Staff 1 if Staff 1\nwas going to do something (meaning fight), but Staff 1 kept\nwalking. Youth C did not see who or when the first punch was\nthrown or swung by either Youth A or Staff 1. Youth C said he\nsaw Staff 3 holding Youth A down and heard Youth A say “stop\nhitting me, and that’s how he knew Staff 1 had swung at Youth A.\nYouth C was not sure how long or how Staff 3 held Youth A.\nYouth C denied seeing any bruises on Youth A after the incident.\nOn 7/11/2025 I interviewed Youth A face-to-face at her Genesee\nCounty Juvenile Justice Center (GCJC). Youth A reported being\nplaced in the Holy Cross IL home for two months prior to the\nincident with Staff 1, and her being placed at GCJC. Youth A said\nshe had asked Staff 1 and Staff 3 to take her grocery shopping,\nand Staff 1 said no, and “I’m not sure why you are asking me, I\ndon’t like you.” Youth A did not report why Staff 1 would say that\nto her or whether she responded to that remark. She reported\nStaff 1 did not like certain youths and would not do things for\nthem. Youth A reported she had spoken to Youth C and Youth C\nhad also asked staff to cook food and was told no, due to it being\nafter 9:00 PM. Youth A did not think it was fair that Youth C was\nnot allowed to cook after the IL home’s cut off time when the staff\nhad just allowed Youth B to do so. Youth A said she went to the\noffice and asked Staff 1 and Staff 2 about that, and Staff 1\nslammed the door in her face. Youth A said she went back to the\ndoor and told Staff 1 “When you come out, I need that” which\nYouth A said meant “I need to fight you”. Youth A reported she\nwanted to fight Staff 1 due to Staff 1 slamming the door in her\nface. Youth A did not report being harmed by the door being\nslammed. She reported she went back and forth talking to Youth\nC, and then she tried talking to Staff 1 again. As she was talking\nto Staff 1, Staff 1 put the tip of Staff 1’s finger on Youth A’s\nforehead and pushed Youth A’s forehead backward. Youth A then\nbegan to hit and punch Staff 1. Youth A said Staff 1 punched her\nand that “we were fighting”.\nYouth A said Staff 3 intervened in the fight and was holding her,\nwhich allowed Staff 1 “to get free punches”. Youth A admitted to\nholding Staff 1 and biting Staff 1’s breast. Youth A reported Staff\n1’s breast was the first thing she could grab, and it was her way of\ndefending herself, because Staff 1 kept hitting her and Staff 3 was\nonly holding her. Youth A admitted to hitting Staff 1 with her tablet\nand clarified that she did that after Staff 1 pushed her forehead.\nShe said that was the point they were really fighting. Youth A said\nthe fight ended when Staff 1 decided not to hit her anymore, and\n5",
    "they got up. Youth A did not clarify what they got up from, or\nwhen or how they went down. She said, during the fight the other\ngirls were screaming at Staff 3 “why are you letting her hit her”.\nYouth A did not say which girls were screaming. Youth A was not\nsure who called the police, but she reported by the time the police\narrived she had walked away from the area of the fight. Youth A\nreported she said, “I just beat the fuck out of Ms. (Staff 1’s last\nname) because she hit me”.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 had a bruise on the face from her hitting\nStaff 1 with the tablet. Youth A said she had a scratch on her face\nand chest which are gone now. Youth A reported aside from Staff\n2 calling the police on her once, due to Staff 2 thinking she would\ndo something with Staff 2’s car, she had no disagreements or\nproblems with any of the staff, including Staff 1, until this incident.\nOn 7/16/2025 I interviewed Staff 2 by telephone. Staff 2 reported\nbeing a witness to the incident at the beginning. It was at the start\nof her 10:00PM shift and Staff 1 was briefing her when Youth C\ncame and asked to cook. They told Youth C no, because the rule\nis the youths do not cook after 9:00PM. Youth A went to Youth C\nand Staff 2 heard Youth A say, “This is “bullshit. I bet I can get\nfood and dishes to cook.” Youth A came to the office door\naggressively and asked Staff 1 “what are you looking at”. Staff 1\ntried to close the door, but it could not be completely closed due to\na broken screw in the door. Staff 2 said after Youth A walked\naway, Staff 1 announced she was leaving and walked to the front\nof the house, to exit that door, but Youth A was there. Youth A\ntold Staff 1 “I want my 1 with you”, which Staff 2 said was slang for\n“I want to fight you”. Staff 2 heard Staff 1 tell Youth A she was not\ngoing to fight because Youth A was her client. Staff 2 said, then\nshe heard a banging noise, and heard Staff 1 say, “call the police”.\nStaff 2 reported the physical incident happened at the other end of\nthe house; and she did not see the altercation until she checked\nthe camera. Staff 2 said the camera showed Staff 1 in the\ndoorway with her arms folded and Youth A talking to Staff 1. Staff\n1 walked away, then Youth A hit Staff 1 in the face with an iPad,\nand Staff 1 pushed Youth A away. Staff 2 reported after the latter\nhappened, she did not see anything else. She never saw the two\nof them on the floor, and never saw Staff 1 swing on or hit Youth\nA. Staff 2 reported she only saw Staff 1 push Youth A backward\nto push her away from attacking her. Staff 2 reported knowing\nYouth A bit Staff 1’s breast, because Staff 1 said it happened.\n6",
    "After the incident Staff 2 denied observing marks or bruises to\nYouth A or Youth A reporting any. Staff 2 observed blood on Staff\n1’s face. Additionally, Staff 2 who had worked with Staff 1 since\nJanuary 2025 reported never observing Staff 1 to hit, or harm a\nchild, nor to be negative towards Youth A or any child.\nOn 7/18/2025 I interviewed Staff 3 by telephone. Staff 3 reported\nbeing employed at the IL home since January 2025. She\ndescribed the events leading to the altercation similar to Staff 2.\nShe said she did not witness Youth A coming to the life skills\noffice or her making remarks to Staff 1. She only observed that on\ncamera. She saw Staff 1 walking toward the door to leave and\nheard Youth A telling Staff 1 to come outside so they could fight\nand heard Youth A say, “I’ll beat your ass”. Staff 3 said Staff 1 did\nnot engage with Youth A and Staff 1 kept walking away from\nYouth A. Staff 3 then heard a noise and Staff 1 yelling “help,\nhelp”. Staff 3 arrived and saw Staff 1 trying to pull away from\nYouth A and Youth A was hitting Staff 1. Staff 3 said she put her\nbody in between Youth A and Staff 1, trying to pull them apart, but\nYouth A was holding tight onto Staff 1’s bag, or shirt, or\nsomething. Staff 3 was not sure what exactly Youth A was holding\nonto on Staff 1, but Staff 3 said it was not a body part. Staff 3 said\nYouth A was throwing punches and she was surprised she did not\nget hit. Staff 3 said Staff 1 was jerking around and trying to free\nherself from Youth A’s grip, but Staff 1 could not. Nor could Staff 3\nfree Staff 1. She said Staff 1 had to raise her hand and hit Youth A\nto free herself from Youth A. Staff 3 did not see where Staff 1’s\nhand landed on Youth A’s body.\nAfter the incident Staff 3 denied observing marks or bruises to\nYouth A or Youth A reporting any. Staff 3 observed Staff 1 to\nhave a cut under the left eye that was bleeding, a scratch on the\nright side of her neck and a bruise on her breast where Youth A bit\nher. Staff 3 reported knowing about the bruise to Staff 1’s breast\nbecause the male police who came out on this incident asked her\nto look at Staff 1’s breast, so he could report on it. Additionally,\nStaff 3 who had worked with Staff 1 for over five years reported\nnever observing Staff 1 to hit, or harm a child, nor to be negative\ntowards Youth A or any child. Staff 3 added that what happened to\nStaff 1 could have happened to any one of them, because Youth\nA, in the last several weeks before her departure from the IL home\nhad become combative and antagonist with staff and the other\nyouths; and tried to pick a fight.\nOn 7/18/205, I interviewed Staff 1 on video via TEAMS. Staff 1\nreported working for the agency in other agency program since\n7",
    "September 2021. She has worked as a Youth Recovery Worker in\nthis IL home since November 2024.\nStaff 1 reported after she and Staff 3 advised Youth A that Youth\nA was not allowed to cook due to the kitchen being closed; Youth\nA told them she hoped they would die driving home and walked\naway. Staff 1 left and went to the staff office and was briefing Staff\n2 who had come on shift, when another youth came and made the\nsame request to cook as Youth A had. That youth, who Staff 1 did\nnot name, was also told no, and the youth left cursing. Staff 1\nsaid Youth A came to the staff’s office and told her to “Get the fuck\nout her way”; and Staff 1 closed the office door. Staff 1 said she\nclosed the door hard because she knew if she had not, Youth A\nwould try to open it, because Youth A was yelling and cursing at\nher. Staff 1 said she waited for Youth A to leave, and after she did\nnot hear Youth A outside the door, she decided to leave to go to\nher car. Staff 1 reported as she got to the front entrance way,\nYouth A was there. Youth A told her to come outside and “You\nneed to run me that” which meant, come fight me. Staff 1 said\nshe told Youth A she was not fighting her. Staff 1 folded her arms\nand was walking back. Youth A was yelling, cursing and trying to\nget Staff 1 to feed into her behavior. Staff 1 said she turned\naround and told Youth A that she was not going to fight her\nbecause she was a child. Staff 1 reported it was at that point that\nYouth A hit her in the face with the edge of an iPad. Staff 1\nreported she went to grab Youth A upper arm or wrist to put her in\na bent down position so that Youth A would not be able to move.\nStaff 1 said the two of them were both bent over, and she was\ntrying to restrict Youth A’s movement so Youth A would not hit her\nagain. Staff 1 was also yelling out for help; and then Youth A bit\nStaff 1 on the left breast. Staff 1 said she had to squeeze Youth\nA’s cheeks together to get Youth A to release her breast. Staff 1\nreported the squeezing of the youth’s cheek is what she was\ntaught to do in case of a being bitten by a client. Staff 1 reported\nwhen Youth A released her breast, she and Youth A both came up\nto the upright position; and Youth A hit her in the face with the\niPad again. Staff 1 reported at this point Staff 3 forced herself in\nbetween her and Youth A. Staff 1 reported she still could not\nmove to free herself from Youth A, because Youth A was holding\non to her work bag or shirt. During this time Youth A was spitting,\nand it was getting in Staff 1’s face and she assumed also onto\nStaff 3. Staff 1 said she had to hit Youth A with an open hand on\nthe top of Youth A’s head to get Youth A to release her. Staff 1\nsaid she used her left hand, and it was not with great force. As\nsoon she hit Youth A, Youth A said, “You hit me, you’re going to\njail.” Youth A was also yelling about how she had messed up\n8",
    "Staff 1’s face and the other girls were also yelling and hollering.\nStaff 1 did not report what the other youths were yelling, or who\nthose youths were, because she was afraid, so she walked toward\nthe door and left. Staff 1 said her face was bloody and Youth A\nwas yelling “I beat your ass.” Youth A did not have any marks or\nbruises that Staff 1 saw.\nStaff 1 said a few days before this incident Youth A was saying\nshe was going to beat someone up. Staff 1 reported Youth A’s\nbehavior had always been loud, instigating, dramatic and\naggressive; where it was always hard to talk with her, but Staff 1\nwas always cordial with Youth A. Staff 1 denied that she was\nangry during the incident. She said she was in disbelief, shock,\nand hurt. She said she had never had a youth to blatantly\ndisregard her, and she never thought she would get attacked.\nStaff 1 also denied that she was trying to restrain Youth A. She\nstated, “I do not know one person restraint.” She said she was\ntrying not to be hit again. She was trying to hold Youth A until help\ncame. She stated her action of hitting the top of Youth A’s head\nwas a last resort to try to free herself from Youth A’s hold on her.\nShe added that the agency has a no restraint policy. They are CPI\n(Crisis Prevention Intervention),trained and they are not permitted\nto restrain. They are only allowed to hold a child whom they can’t\nde-escalate and in this situation it was an assault on her. Staff 1\nreported she did not leave after she was hit the first time, because\nshe knew Youth A would still attack her as she walked away. That\nis what Youth A had done in another situation when she had to\nbreak up a fight between Youth A and a peer in March or April of\nthis year. In that situation Staff 1 reported Youth A put hands\naround her neck as Youth A tried to move Staff 1 away in Youth\nA’s attempt to go after the peer. Staff 1 reported at no time did\nshe try to or want to harm Youth A; she was trying to stop the\nassault.\nDocument Review:\nVideo footage for the 6/15/2025 incident consisting of two clips of\ncamera footage, from Compliance Manager (CM):\n• The first camera clip from the dining room area showed:\no A youth identified as Youth A walked into the dining\narea carrying an electronic device identified by CM\nas an iPad. Youth A went into what appeared to be\na kitchen; then she exited quickly back through the\ndoor/hallway area she had entered from.\n9",

Staff 1 denied she was trying to restrain Youth A. She\nstated, “I do not know one person restraint.” She said she was\ntrying not to be hit again. She was trying to hold Youth A until help\ncame. She added the agency has a no restraint policy. They are\nCPI (Crisis Prevention Intervention) trained, and they are not\npermitted to restrain. They are only allowed to hold a child whom\nthey can’t de-escalate, and, in this situation, it was an assault on\n11",
    "her. During another part of the incident, Staff 1 said she had to hit\nYouth A with an open hand on the top of Youth A’s head to get\nYouth A to release her. Staff 1 said she used her left hand, and it\nwas not with great force.\nVideo Review:\nVideo footage for the 6/15/2025 is not clear enough to show Staff\n1 hitting Youth A on the head or putting her in a type of restraint\nhold.\nDocument Review:\nCopy of Holy Cross’s behavior management policy & procedure\nwhich indicated:\no It is the policy of Holy Cross Services (HCS) that all\nparticipants have the right to receive treatment services\nfree from the threat of physical management in which\nparticipants are taken or held on the floor, chemical\nrestraint, seclusion, and any form of retaliatory\npunishment.\no HCS practices a restraint-free behavior management\nprogram throughout all program sites. In extreme cases,\nemergency personnel will be contacted to intervene, if\nsuch intervention is warranted by the actions of the\nparticipant.\no HCS staff are provided with in-depth orientation and\ntraining in the proper and safe use of behavior\nmanagement techniques, including but not limited to non-\nphysical de-escalation and emergency intervention\ntechniques.\nAn Incident Report dated 6/15/2025 was consistent with Staff 1’s\nstatement that she hit Youth on the head with an open\nhand, to free herself from Youth A.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed, Staff 1 admitted to\nholding Youth A in some type of restraint position and admitted to\nhitting Youth A on the top of the head with an open hand. Based\non these actions by Staff 1, she did not follow the agency’s policy\nof non-physical behavioral management.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n• Restraints are not appropriate procedures for IL youth.\n• Staff 1 noted “They are only allowed to hold a child whom\nthey can’t de-escalate”, which conflicts with the facility’s no-\nrestraint policy. Clarification should be provided for staff to\nensure they understand the policy and definitions of\n12",
    "restraint. The definition of restraint is the application of\nphysical force, without the use of a device, which restricts\nthe free movement of a youth’s body.\nConclusion REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR#2025SIC0000131 dated 2/12/25; CAP approved 3/25/25\nIV.
