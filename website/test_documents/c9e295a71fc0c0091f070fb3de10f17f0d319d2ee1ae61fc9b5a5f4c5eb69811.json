    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Care Worker flirted with the father of Youth A and Youth B.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Complainant by phone on 5/21/2025. Complainant\nstated Foster Care Worker did not flirt with Father, but Father\nattempted to flirt with Foster Care Worker. Complainant reported\nshe wanted the agency to change the case worker due to the\nFather's attraction to Foster Care Worker. Complainant reported\nFather stated he was attracted to Foster Care Worker, and he\nattempted to flirt with Foster Care Worker.\nI interviewed Foster Care Supervisor by phone on 5/21/2025.\nFoster Care Supervisor reported Foster Care Worker did not flirt\nwith Father, but Foster Care Worker had notified Foster Care\nSupervisor that Father had flirted with Foster Care Worker. Foster\nCare Supervisor stated Foster Care Worker responded\nappropriately to Father's comments.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker by phone on 5/22/2025. Foster\nCare Worker denied flirting with Father of the children but reported\nFather had attempted to flirt with Foster Care Worker. Foster\nCare Worker stated she did not reciprocate the attempt and\nreported the incident to Foster Care Supervisor. Foster Care\nWorker stated she had text message documentation related to the\nincident and she would send that information to me. Foster Care\nWorker stated she did not have any direct contact with Father as\ncommunication had been through text messages and video chat\ncontact only.\nThree attempts were made to contact Father to confirm the\ncontent of Father’s text messages, but Father was unresponsive.\nTwo messages were left on 08/05/2025 and a third message on\n08/07/2025 requesting Father to call/contact this consultant;\nhowever, Father failed to return contact.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the text messages between Foster Care Worker and\nFather. Father stated in one text message related to whether he\nwould be able to attend a scheduled meeting, \"Oh yes I love\nseeing u and I will definitely be there.\" Foster Care Worker\nresponded to the line of texts by stating “Okay” and “Are you able\nto log on?”\n2",
    "In another text message exchange where Foster Care Worker\nwas reporting Foster Care Worker would no longer be supervising\nvideo chats, Father responded by stating, \"I hope it's not my fault\nthat u will no longer be supervising the video chats.\" Foster Care\nWorker responded that it was easier for foster parents and Father\nresponded, \"But yes I wanted to make sure because sometimes I\ncatch myself flirting with u and I know that's wrong but I can't help\nit so I just wanted to make sure I wasn't the reason.\" Foster Care\nWorker responded within this line of texts by stating, “Reminder\nthat your virtual visit with the boys is today at 6:30, so 5:30 your\ntime, foster parent sent you the link in your email. In response to\nyour text I just want to remind you that we have a strictly\nprofessional relationship.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance per staff and complainant\ninterviews that were completed and text documentation that was\nreviewed. Agency staff denied the allegation and Complainant\nstated the flirtation was from Father and not from Foster Care\nWorker. The content of text messages reviewed supports this\ndetermination.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n07/28/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 12, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n3"
