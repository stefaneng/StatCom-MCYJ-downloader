    "Resident A was interviewed at the Grand Rapids Police Station on June 26, 2020 by\nDHHS Investigator 2 and Law Enforcement Officer 4. I participated by telephone.\nResident A said that he was close to Staff 1 and that she was his favorite staff. He\ndenied ever kissing or holding hands with her. Resident A stated that he was friends\nwith Staff 7 and Staff 1. Resident A stated that Staff 1 had given him a Build-A-Bear\nas a gift. He stated that he gave her a \"snow bear\" in return. He stated that the bear\nfrom Staff 1 was special to him because it was from Staff 1. Resident A would not\nelaborate further why the bear was special. Resident A then stated that Staff 1 was\nhis \"favorite person\". He stated that she would play soccer and football with him. He\nstated that he would talk with her about things that he would not talk with other\npeople about and he trusted her.\nStaff 1 was interviewed at the Grand Rapids Police Station also on June 26, 2020 by\nDHHS Investigator 2 and Law Enforcement Officer 4. I participated by telephone.\nStaff 1 denied ever kissing or holding hands with Resident A.\nDHHS Investigator 2 confronted Staff 1 regarding her disclosures. DHHS\nInvestigator 2 inquired why a witness had disclosed seeing her kissing Resident A\nand holding his hand. She denied that she has ever kissed Resident A while they\nwere by the woods or held his hand. She stated that she would let Resident A play\nwith her hands often, but they were not holding hands. She stated that they may\nhave hugged but that was it. Staff 1 denied that she ever had told Resident A that\n\"her heart was locked inside\" the bear she gave him. DHHS Investigator 2 inquired\nwhy there is phone records and evidence to support that she had corresponded with\nResident A more than she disclosed. Staff 1 admitted that she had contact with\nResident A by phone three times when she was on administrative leave. DHHS\nInvestigator 2 confronted Staff 1 about responding to texts from Resident A if she\nwas told to not have contact with him. Staff 1 admitted that she has received a text\nfrom Resident A asking to Facetime when his foster parent was gone. She admitted\nthat she \"liked\" the text and agreed to it. Staff 1 stated that she understood how this\nbehavior is inappropriate between a residential staff member and a prior resident.\nOn July 9, 2020 I met with Chief Program Director 6 at the facility he said that their\npolicy is to not allow contact between staff and discharged residents. Staff 1\npersonnel file was reviewed. Staff 1 was hired on January 13, 2020 and her\npersonnel file contained all appropriate documents and training.\nThe facility has had 13 substantiated special investigations in the last 24 months. In\nthose 13 special investigations 19 rule violations were cited. These citations include\nCCI 159(2) Resident restraint cited 7 times, CCI158(2) Discipline 3 times and CCI\n126 Sufficiency of staff 2 times.\nThe following rules were cited once in the last 24 months:\n CCI142(1) Health services; policies and procedures\n CCI 109(1) Program statement CCI 159(3) Written policy of resident restraint\n CCI 150(3) Incident reporting",

These policies and procedures shall be\navailable to all residents, their families, and referring agencies\n CCI128 (5) An employee shall not participate in restraining a resident or\nplacing a resident in seclusion prior to receiving training on those topics.
