    "Allegation The agency brought the foster parent to the office to address a\ncomplaint under false pretenses and the foster parent was not\nprepared with a support person as entitled.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nChild Welfare Director was interviewed by phone 12/20/2024.\nShe reported the agency received an allegation on 12/5/2024 that\nFoster Parent was in a relationship with a person who abuses\ndrugs and is physically abusive. Also Foster Parent was using\nmethamphetamine and cocaine. Licensing Worker was assigned\nto investigate the allegations and reached out to Foster Parent on\n12/9/2024 to inform her of the special evaluation. Licensing\nWorker offered to come to Foster Parent to conduct the\ninvestigation. At that time, Licensing Worker told Foster Parent the\nallegation was Foster Parent was in a relationship with an abusive\nperson as Licensing Worker did not want to give Foster Parent A a\n“head’s up” about the drug abuse allegation because they did not\nwant to give Foster Parent time to get drugs out of her system if\nshe was using them. Child Welfare Director stated the agency\nstaff’s experience with Foster Parent did not give them any reason\nto believe the allegations were true; however, the allegation was\nso specific by naming methamphetamine and cocaine as the\ndrugs being abused and the agency staff could not place children\nwith her until the allegations were found to be untrue, so they were\ntrying to complete the evaluation quickly. Child Welfare Director\nreported Foster Parent came to the agency the same day at which\ntime Licensing Worker told Foster Parent about the drug use\nallegation and offered Foster Parent a drug test. The drug test\ncame back positive for marijuana, but not for methamphetamine or\ncocaine.\nWhen Child Welfare Director was asked to clarify if Foster Parent\nwas told of the allegations prior to being interviewed, she stated\nFoster Parent was told she was allegedly in a relationship with an\n“abusive person which encompasses drug abuse.”\nFoster Parent was interviewed by phone 1/7/2025. She stated\nshe works for a foster care agency and was at a work event on\n12/9/2024 when Licensing Worker called her to inform her there\nwas an allegation Foster Parent was in an abusive relationship.\nLicensing Worker informed her she could have a support person\npresent during her interview. Foster Parent stated she did not\nneed a support person present as she was not in that relationship,\nso she told Licensing Worker she would come to the agency the\nfollowing day to be interviewed to expedite the investigation.\nWhen Foster Parent arrived at the agency the following day, she\n2",
    "sat down with Licensing Worker who told her the allegation was\nthat Foster Parent was using drugs and Foster Parent needed to\ntake a drug test. Foster Parent was surprised and asked Licensing\nWorker what would happen if she did not take the drug test to\nwhich Licensing Worker responded it would “look bad,” so Foster\nParent complied. Foster Parent reported she was never told what\nlicensing rule was being investigated. Foster Parent stated\nLicensing Worker never asked her about her personal safety or\nanything about being in a physically abusive relationship.\nLicensing Worker was interviewed via video conferencing\n1/17/2025. Compliance Director was also present during the\ninterview as a support person. Licensing Worker reported her\nsupervisor assigned her an investigation regarding allegations that\nFoster Parent was in a romantic relationship with a man who is a\nknown drug abuser and who has been abusive to relationship\npartners in the past. The allegation also included Foster Parent\nusing illegal substances. Licensing Worker stated she was\nassigned the special evaluation on a Thursday and reached out to\nFoster Parent by phone the following Monday. Licensing Worker\nreported she told Foster Parent a complaint came into the agency\nwith concerns resulting in a special evaluation. She stated Foster\nParent sounded anxious and pressed Licensing Worker for\nadditional information. Licensing Worker stated she couldn’t tell\nFoster Parent about the drug use allegations because she wanted\nto drug screen her. Foster Parent pressed further so Licensing\nWorker told her the allegations were that she was in a romantic\nrelationship with a guy who is “inappropriate, unsafe, and\nabusive.” Licensing Worker told Foster Parent she needed to get\nwith her in the next few days after which Foster Parent suggested\nthey meet at Licensing Worker’s office the following day. Licensing\nWorker informed Foster Parent she could have a support person\npresent. Licensing Worker stated they met the following day in the\nagency visit room at which time Licensing Worker explained to\nFoster Parent the allegations about being in an abusive\nrelationship and drug use. When later asked to clarify specifically\nwhat she told Foster Parent the allegations were at this point,\nLicensing Worker responded, the person with whom Foster Parent\nwas in a romantic relationship with was inappropriate, a known\ndrug abuser, and was abusive in past relationships. Licensing\nWorker stated Foster Parent immediately responded stating she\nwas no longer in that relationship. Foster Parent stated she broke\nup with that individual a few weeks prior because his ex-tried to\nstart a fight with Foster Parent. Licensing Worker stated it was at\nthat point she told Foster Parent there were also allegations of\nFoster Parent using illegal drugs. Foster Parent denied using\n3",
    "illegal drugs after which Licensing Worker told Foster Parent, she\nbelieved her and asked her to “voluntarily submit to a drug\nscreen.” Foster Parent asked Licensing Worker about marijuana,\nstating it might be in her system. Licensing Worker told her\nmarijuana use was ok as long as, if it was in her home, it was\nlocked up and not being used around kids. Licensing Worker told\nher she had the right to not submit to take the drug test, but “it’s\nnot a good look” if she didn’t.\nWhen asked to clarify if Licensing Worker gave Foster Parent a\ndetailed description of the full allegations, including drug use by\nFoster Parent, before questioning Foster Parent, Licensing\nWorker stated she asked Foster Parent if she was romantically\ninvolved with the person in question. Licensing Worker also asked\nhow long she had been with him and how long it had been since\nthey broke up. She stated she thought Foster Parent was a nice\nlady and was understanding of the special evaluation. Licensing\nWorker stated she was being empathetic with Foster Parent and\ngave her the vibe the agency was looking out for her.\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED\n• Special Evaluation Report (SER) completed by Licensing\nWorker and approved by Licensing Supervisor\ndocumenting the evaluation was opened under foster home\nlicensing rule 400.9201-1-e. The SER documented no\nviolation was established as Foster Parent’s drug screen\nwas negative and she broke things off with the man in\nquestions after noticing red flags.\nAnalysis A violation is established as Licensing Worker reported asking\nFoster Parent questions about the allegations prior to giving her\nthe full and detailed description of the allegations.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Special evaluation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327\nSection (1) Upon receipt of any information that relates to possible\nDescription noncompliance with any foster home rule, the agency must do all\nthe following:\n(c) Conduct an evaluation, in cooperation with child protective\nservices, when applicable, including all necessary collateral\ncontacts.\n4",
    "Violation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Household members were not interviewed during the special\nevaluation.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nFoster Parent was interviewed by phone 1/7/2025. Foster Parent\nstated she received a report indicating she was found in\ncompliance; however, Licensing Worker has called and texted her\nmultiple times stating she needed to speak to Foster Parent’s\nadult children about Foster Parent’s “drug use.”\nLicensing Worker was interviewed via video conferencing\n1/17/2025. Compliance Director was also present during the\ninterview as a support person. Licensing Worker reported after\nFoster Parent completed her drug screen Foster Parent “got in her\nown head.” Also, Foster Parent works with a person who\npreviously worked at the agency who was likely giving her advice.\nFoster Parent called Licensing Worker and asked her who made\nthe complaint and when the special evaluation would be closed.\nLicensing Worker stated she told Foster Parent she believed\neverything Foster Parent told her, but she couldn’t close the\nspecial evaluation until everything was resolved. Foster Parent\ncalled Licensing worker again the day the drug results were\nreceived at which time Licensing Worker told her the test was\nnegative and that she was trying to hurry to complete the special\nevaluation. Licensing Worker stated she tried to hurry and send\nthe report to Licensing Supervisor who approved the report.\nLicensing Supervisor sent Foster Parent the approved report via\nUSPS along with a determination letter. Licensing Supervisor\nrealized the following day that Licensing Worker did not interview\nFoster Parent’s adult daughters who live with her, so Licensing\nWorker called Foster Parent.
