DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nCCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\n(1) An institution shall maintain employee records\nfor each employee and shall include\ndocumentation of all of the following information\nprior to employment or at the time specified in\nthis rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan\ndepartment of human services, the\nequivalent state or Canadian provincial\nagency, or equivalent agency in the\ncountry where the person usually resides,\nthat the person has not been determined\nto be a perpetrator of child abuse or child\n2",
    "neglect. The documentation shall be\ncompleted not more than 30 days prior to\nthe start of employment and every 12\nmonths thereafter.\nOne of six new employee files reviewed did not have a central registry clearance\ncompleted within 30 days prior to hire date. The clearance was completed on\n2/26/24, but the employee was not hired until 4/15/24.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• If a youth leaves the facility, it is considered a youth discharge under the\nfacility license, even if the youth maintains the same case manager or is\nstill open under another program through Samaritas. A discharge plan must\nbe completed.\n• Discharge plan information was in two different areas. It is recommended\nthe facility complete one summary form to ensure all information is in one\nplace.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require or request any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had one CAP during the period of review as a result of their 2023\nRenewal inspection. The facility received violations regarding dental care and\nSocial Services Worker Qualifications. To rectify the dental care violation, the\nfacility put in procedures regarding caseworkers scheduling appointments well in\nadvance, and supervisor following up during supervision. In addition, the supervisor\nwas responsible for verifying the initial appointment date on the initial placement\nchecklist. To rectify the social services worker qualifications violation, the facility\nwrote a variance, which was approved by DCWL. In addition, the facility put in a\nprocedure that the program manager and HR Business Partner had to verify any\nhires to ensure they qualified for their positions per licensing rules, prior to the\ncandidate being hired.\n3",
    "Financial Overview\nThe facility's financial budget and financial audit were reviewed, and there were no\nconcerns noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted all dentals have been completed timely since the\nimplementation of the CAP from the 2023 renewal inspection. She stated\nimplementing the plan to have workers schedule the initial dental exams at the\nsame time they schedule the initial medical exams has been instrumental in\nachieving timeliness. She also noted that there have been no further issues with\nhiring someone for a social services worker position who didn't meet the\nrequirements. CA noted it continues to be a challenge to identify a social services\nworker who meet the educational qualifications, and also work in the facility's\nservice area. CA noted they have been seeking a replacement for the current social\nservices worker, as the employee is supposed to transfer to another role within\nSamaritas but won't transfer until a replacement is found.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff were interviewed at the facility on 9/12/24. Staff reported they felt supported at\nthe facility, and that the facility was one of the best employers they've ever had.\nThey reported they felt there was open communication and could speak up if they\never had any concerns. No one had any concerns during interviews.\nYouth were interviewed at the facility on 9/12/24. Youth reported they felt safe at\nthe facility, were treated well by staff, did not have any concerns, were receiving\nenough food, liked the food provided, and felt they had staff they could talk to if\nthey ever had any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on 9/12/24, and there were no concerns\nnoted.\n4",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nSeptember 20, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 23, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
