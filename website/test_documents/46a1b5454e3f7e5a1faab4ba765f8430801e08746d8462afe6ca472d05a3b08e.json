    "Allegation On 8/9/24, a staff member gave a youth the wrong medication. All\nappropriate medical parties were contacted following this and it\nwas ordered that youth be observed for adverse reactions.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via video conference on\n11/19/24. Complainant reported he had no further information\nabout the allegations besides what was in the complaint.\nComplainant reported he felt the facility handled the situation\nimmediately and addressed it appropriately.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 11/20/24.\nStaff 1 reported on the date of the incident, there was a lot going\non. Staff 1 reported there was a youth having an escalated\nepisode in the milieu, so the rest of the youth were in the game\nroom with staff to give the escalated youth space. Staff 1 reported\nshe passed medications for Youth A and Youth B at the same\ntime in the game room. Staff 1 reported while she was trying to\ngive Youth A his medications, Youth B came up behind her and\nwas nitpicking with her. Staff 1 reported Youth B’s action\ndistracted her, and she accidently gave Youth A the wrong cup of\nmedications. Staff 1 reported she realized the mistake\nimmediately because Youth A and Youth B’s names were written\non their individual medication cups. Staff 1 reported she\nimmediately completed an incident report, as well as notifications\nto all appropriate parties. Staff 1 reported Youth A was checked\nout by medical staff at the facility, and medical staff reported\nYouth A just needed to be observed for any adverse reactions to\nthe medications. Staff 1 reported she has never had a medication\nerror before. Staff 1 reported she has learned from the situation\nand no longer attempts to pass medication for more than one\nyouth at a time.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 11/26/24. Staff 2 reported\nhe worked on 8/9/24 and remembers hearing something later\nabout a medication mix-up. However, Staff 2 reported he wasn’t\ninvolved in the situation, and wasn’t aware during the shift\nanything occurred.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident report dated 8/9/24 authored by Staff 1 states she\nwas passing medications when Youth A was mistakenly\ngiven Youth B’s medications. Staff 1 contacted nursing,\nclinical, and Youth A’s Foster Care Worker. Nursing told\nStaff 1 to monitor for any adverse reactions to the\nmedication. States medication provided was “Amphet/Dextr\nTab 10 mg”.\n2",
    "• Youth A’s medication log summary verifies the medication\nprovided to him on 8/9/24 “Amphet/Dextr Tab 10 mg” was\nnot on his medication list.\n• Health Services Policy and Procedure states all\nmedication-trained staff will administer medication in\naccordance with Medication Administration and Control\nPolicy.\n• Medication Administration and Control Policy states staff\nare to prepare one youth’s medications at a time. Prepare\nmedications carefully, using the six rights of medication\n(right medication, in the right dose, at the right time, by the\nright route, for the right person, and the right\ndocumentation). Staff are to positively identify the youth\nserved using two identifiers (name, photo, date of birth,\nconfirming with familiar staff) before medication is\nadministered.\n• Medication and Adverse Reactions Policy states a\nmedication error is defined as any error that occurs in the\ntranscription, administration, and/or documentation of\nmedications. If an error is made, employees should\nacknowledge any error, and assess the consumer by taking\nvitals, completing a visual assessment, and making\nrequired notifications. Nursing will assess and provide\nfurther instruction, as needed. Incident report is required to\nbe completed.\n• Staff 1 has two disciplinary records in her employee file,\nunrelated to this investigation. Staff 1 was trained in\nmedication administration and monitoring on 12/17/22 and\n1/17/24.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as per interviews\nconducted and documentation reviewed, Staff 1 did not follow the\nfacility’s Medication Administration and Control Policy which says\nstaff are to prepare one youth’s medication at a time. As a result,\nYouth A was provided the wrong medication on 8/9/24.\nConclusion Violation Established\n3",
