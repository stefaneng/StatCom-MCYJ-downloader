    "INVESTIGATION:\nI spoke with Administrator 1 on the phone on 6/7/21. She indicated that Youth A\nwas at school but would be back at the facility in the early afternoon each day.\nI interviewed Youth A in person at the facility on 6/9/21. He began the interview\nby stating “the allegations are what happened”. He reported Staff 1 told him he will\ncheck his pockets “the hard way or easy way” but he is going to check his pockets.\nHe also reported he left the building to talk to another youth outside and was\nfollowed by Staff 1. He reported having nothing in his pockets but as he told the\nstory, he reported Staff 1 found a popsicle and juice box in his pockets. He reported\nwearing a hoodie and having these items in the pouch of the hoodie. He reported\ntelling Staff 2 he was assaulted by Staff 1 and having Staff 2 tell him he was not\nassaulted. He also reported telling Staff 2 this on 6/8/21. He reported being pushed\nto the ground by Staff 1 after he checked his pockets and having Youth B witness\nthe entire incident. He ended by stating he “feels safe here”.\nI interviewed Youth B in person at the facility on 6/9/21. He reported being a\nwitness to the incident described in the allegations and stated the events occurred\njust as described. He reported being present but amended his report to being inside\nof the facility and observing the incident through a window (approximately 60 feet\naway). He reported the following.\nIt looked like Staff 1 tried to grab something out of his sweater and then pushed\nhis to the ground. He pushed him from the front, and he fell to the ground on his\nback. I didn’t know what was going on between them.\nHe reported youth are checked for items when they return to campus and if a youth\nrefused to cooperate, they will experience a consequence. He reported the\nconsequence will be the loss of television time or something else. He reported\nfeeling safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 in person at the facility on 6/9/21. She reported not\nbeing aware of the allegations but receiving information from Youth A’s therapist\nabout him wanting to get Staff 1 fired. She denied having knowledge of a safety plan\nbecause she didn’t know of the allegations.\nI interviewed Staff 1 in person at the facility on 6/9/21. He reported remembering\nthe incident but denied the allegations occurred as reported. He reported the facility\nhas a process of checking all youth returning to campus for items they are not\nallowed to possess. He also reported Youth A was the only youth who took\nexception to having to be checked and he reported he is often caught with food he is\ntrying to sneak into his room. He reported food is not allowed in the bedroom for\nsanitary reasons. He reported Youth C was outside at the time and Youth A went\noutside which is against the rule of only one youth outside at a time. He reported\nYouth A “had a hoodie draped over his neck but was not really wearing the hoodie”.\nHe reported reaching into the pouch of the hoodie and finding the popsicle and juice\n3",
    "box. He also reported denying he pushed Youth A, or that Youth A fell to the ground.\nHe reported Youth A grabbed his hand when he grabbed the food items but let go\nwhen he told him to let go. He reported never touching Youth A and having a\nwitness within a couple of feet during the exchange. He identified the witness as\nYouth C.\nI interviewed Youth C in person at the facility on 6/9/21. She reported being\npresent during the incident between Staff 1 and Youth A. She reported “Youth A was\nnot supposed to be outside because only one youth at a time can be outside and\nStaff 1 came outside because of this”. She reported, “Staff 1 told Youth A he knew\nhe had food and he needed to give it to him so he can put it into his box. Youth A\nrefused to give up the food.” She gave the same report about the hoodie being\nwrapped around Youth A and Staff 1 reaching into the pouch to get the food items.\nShe denied Staff 1 pushed Youth A to the ground or he had any physical contact\nwith Youth A. She reported observing nothing inappropriate but observing Youth A\njust not wanting to follow the rules. She reported feeling safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Therapist 1 in person at the facility on 6/9/21. She reported Youth\nA was “very upset” with Staff 1 during a therapy session on June 3, 2021, because\n“Staff 1 is reported by Youth A to give him consequences for things”. She reported\nYouth A stated, “he wanted Staff 1 to get fired or die a slow and painful death”. She\nwas asked about Youth B and reported “he likes to be involved in things and wants\nto be liked by his peers”.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone on 6/11/21. She reported being told by Youth A\nStaff 1 assaulted him, but she also reported knowing of the allegations prior to being\ntold by Youth A. She reported Youth A was upset because “Staff 1 believed he had\ncandy in her pockets”. She reported asking Youth A if the shove was hard and Youth\nA responded it was. She also reported no other information was provided by Youth\nA.\nDocuments Reviewed\nI received the following email from the Case Worker on 6/29/21.\nI do not have any other additional information. Youth A was consistent in the\nstory that I reported when I went to visit him. Youth A has stated multiple times\nthat he does not like this staff member and did not like him when this incident\noccurred.\nI reviewed information from the Human Resources file of Staff 1. Documentation\nindicates he is current on all training including behavior management techniques.\nDocumentation also indicates the only disciplinary action with Staff 1 took place on\n3/28/2019 in the form of a verbal warning. This action was taken because he needed\nto “attend staff meetings and keep up to date on own training”. Evaluations since\nthat time have been identified as “outstanding”.\n4",
    "I reviewed the therapy note for the individual session that took place on 6/3/21.\nWithin the note it is documented Youth A was very upset and frustrated with “first\nshift staff and reported ‘wanting them to be fired’ and wished them slow and painful\ndeaths. It is documented Youth A reported receiving consequences for nothing and\nwill not follow the rules ‘until you guys start treating me like an adult is when I will\nstart acting like one’. The conclusion of the therapist is Youth A engaged in flawed\nthinking patterns and tends to blame others for his actions.\nI reviewed the daily progress note for Youth A dated 6/4/21 for the first shift. This\nnote outlines the treatment goals and staff’s interventions for each day. His overall\nbehaviors are also documented and state the following.\nAfter returning home from the last day of school Youth A again was gamey about\ntrying to hide food Youth A brought home from school. Youth A gave some to be\nput in his box, but staff could see other food. Staff ended up confiscating the\ncontraband.\nI reviewed the current Treatment Plan for Youth A. This document covers 3/6/21 to\n5/24/21 and addresses the presenting problems with the identified treatment goals.\nAll social work contacts and therapy (individual and group) sessions are identified\nwithin the report, and he is receiving services daily and weekly. The aftercare plan is\noutlined.\nI reviewed the document titled “Standard Operating Procedures: Contraband\nChecks”. This document outlines the process staff are to use when checking a\nyouth’s room to ensure that items considered contraband are removed. These\ncontraband checks are to occur during first and second shift.\nI reviewed the document titled “YIELD” which addresses the behavioral responsibility\nof youth. This document states that youth are not to have food in their rooms and all\nfood items must be stored within their “bin in the office”.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(2) At a minimum, the behavior management system shall\ninclude all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) A structured system designed to reward the positive\nbehavior of individual residents based upon the effort put\nforth.\n(b) Positive intervention strategies to assist residents in\ndeveloping improved problem solving, self-management,\nand social skills.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews and written\ndocumentation do not support the allegations of staff\nmishandling Youth A. Staff 1 and Youth C both report being\npresent, and both deny the allegations. Youth B reported being\na witness but was looking outside from inside the facility\napproximately sixty feet away. He acknowledges not knowing\nwhat was occurring at the time. Evidence presented suggests\nthat Youth A has a “hidden agenda” in wanting to get Staff 1\nfired and may have fabricated the allegations.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that this investigation be closed with no change made to the\nlicense of this Child Caring Institution\n6/30/2021\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6",

    "summary": "An investigation was conducted into allegations that a staff member at Maple Lodge Group Home roughed up and pushed a youth (Youth A) during a contraband check. The report concludes that the allegations were not substantiated, as statements from the accused staff member (Staff 1) and a witness youth (Youth C) contradicted the account, and evidence suggested Youth A had a pre-existing grudge and motive to get Staff 1 fired. Ultimately, the state found no policy violations occurred during the incident.",
