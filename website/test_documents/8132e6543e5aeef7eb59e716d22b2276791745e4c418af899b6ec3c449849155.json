    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP, approved 8/24/21, was developed as a result of the 8/3/21 renewal\nevaluation. The 8/3/21 review found two violations regarding service plan approval\nand medical passports. During this review, one repeat violation was found regarding\ntimely service plan approval. Although there was a repeat violation, the rate of\noccurrence decreased, as there was only one USP with a late approval date. Overall,\nthe agency’s CAP implementation regarding medical passports was successful, and\nimprovement was found regarding service plans.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) was reviewed and discussed at the\nagency visit on 8/11/22. The CAA reported successful CAP implementation over the\npast year, stable staffing, financially stability, and high compliance in several areas as\ntracked through key performance indicators with DHHS. The CAA reported no\ndisrupted placements or unplanned moves. Overall, the Chief Administrator reported\nintakes have been slower, but the agency is stable and functioning well.\nInterviews\nTwo staff interviews were completed on-site. Staff reported the agency has a positive\nenvironment, where they work well together. Caseloads are busy, but manageable.\nThe supervisor is helpful, knowledgeable, and supportive. The Chief Administrator is\napproachable and helpful with anything staff need. The staff did not have any\nconcerns or suggestions for improvement at the agency.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\n5",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes, and rules, MISEP requirements, and contract/policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on\na regular license.\n_ ______________August 13, 2022________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 15, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
