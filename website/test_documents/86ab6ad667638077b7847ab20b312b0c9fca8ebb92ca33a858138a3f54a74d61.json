Overall,\nthe facility is in compliance with CAP based on the improvement to the\nprevious areas of repeat non-compliance during this inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment – The Chief Administrator Assessment was\nreviewed, and the assessment did identify some areas of non-compliance which were\nappropriate and accurate based on the inspection findings.\nInterviews – The staff members interviewed reported feeling supported by their co-\nworkers and superiors. They reported the use of checklists and other mechanisms\ndeveloped after last year’s inspection to improve compliance.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified safety concern in 1 home as follows:\nSafety Alert: The family was utilizing space heaters to heat the bedrooms. The wood\nburner did not have a barrier. The foster parent could not explain why a smoke\ndetector was beeping on and off during the home visit, stating it was hardwired.\nResolution: I reviewed a safety plan signed by the family and agency on 3/2/22\nstating that the family would not use the space heaters in the home and that the local\noffice would provide appropriate heating units for the family. On 3/4/2022 I reviewed\nreceipts provided by the local office for electric panel wall heater being delivered to\nthe foster home. I reviewed a safety plan signed by the family and agency on 3/2/22\nstating that the children would not be allowed unsupervised in the room with the wood\nburner until a safety gate was installed. On 3/4/2022 I reviewed receipts provided by\nthe local office for a child barrier gate being delivered to the foster home. I reviewed a\nsafety plan signed by the family and agency on 3/2/22 stating that the family would\ninstall a functioning smoke detector. On 3/4/2022 I reviewed a photo of a properly\ninstalled smoke detector, which had been provided by the local office.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be\nissued a renewal of their regular license.\n10",
