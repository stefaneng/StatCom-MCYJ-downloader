    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12417 Foster Parent Information\nSection (1) An agency shall provide a foster parent with all of the following\nDescription information before the placement or replacement of a child… (a-j)\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not provide mental health or behavioral information\nabout child to foster parents, when seeking placement.\nInvestigation Complainant was contacted by phone and email on 4/18/23.\nComplainant responded via email on 4/19/23 stating they had\nprevious placement of Youth A and were familiar with his\nbehaviors and mental health needs. Complainant indicated she\nfiled the complainant as she was aware of the agency contacting\npotential foster parents for placement and not providing\ninformation about all of Youth A's behavioral issues and mental\nhealth needs. Complainant stated they received some information\nabout Youth A prior to placement. However, he displayed\nadditional defiant and aggressive behaviors after being in their\nhome for a few weeks. Complainant stated they did not feel\nenough information was provided about Youth A before accepting\nplacement. Complainant did not recall receiving or signing a\nplacement outline detailing information about Youth A.\nChief Administrator was contacted by phone on 4/18/23. An email\nwas also sent as the phone number on file was incorrect. Chief\nAdministrator responded by email stating that placements for\nYouth A had been challenging lately, due to increasing needs.\nChief Administrator provided contact information for the staff\nidentified by Complainant.\nSupervisor was interviewed via Teams on 4/20/23. Supervisor\nreported Youth A had several moves over the past few months.\nThis occurred after an adoptive placement was unsuccessful.\nYouth A moved to one foster home, in which his behaviors\nincreased and he was taken to the hospital, then placed in a\nmental health/behavior stabilization program, before returning to\nthe foster home. The foster parents ultimately decided not to\nmaintain placement. Youth A has since been in several foster\nhomes. Youth A had a lengthy trauma history, difficult at school,\nmental health needs, and behavioral needs. All of which seemed\nto escalate after the failed adoptive placement. Supervisor\nreported that she and another staff are often the ones that contact\npotential adoptive parents. Typically, a placement request\n2",
    "document is completed by the foster care worker. Then potential\nfoster parents are contacted with preliminary information. If the\nfoster parent is interested, additional details about the youth are\nprovided, typically through phone conversations. Supervisor\nstated she knew it was important to share all of Youth A's history\nwith potential placements. But she also wanted to protect his\nprivacy by only fully sharing with those that were interested after\nthe preliminary information. Supervisor and DCWL discussed\ndifferent ways to document what information was provided to the\ninterested foster parents and when. The use of a case contact,\nindicating the placement request paperwork was reviewed with the\nfoster parent would be acceptable. Or documenting the names of\nthe families on the placement request itself. However, a\nplacement outline (DHHS-3307) should still be completed when a\nchild is placed in a foster home, as this form captures the foster\nparent’s signature to indicate they fully received the required\ninformation. Supervisor acknowledged the agency was cited for\nrule 417 during the December 2022 annual review. This citation\nwas due to the agency not documenting the required information\nwas provided to foster parents at placement. Supervisor reported\ntheir CAP was implemented in January 2023, which included\nutilizing calendar reminders for staff to complete the required\ndocumentation (DHHS-3307). Supervisor reported that overall,\nthis process has worked well. However, regarding Youth A’s case,\nSupervisor stated she took ownership over the missed documents\nfrom the file. Supervisor indicated they were behind with\npaperwork while managing placement crises with Youth A.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via Teams on\n4/28/23. FCW reported that she does not have much involvement\nwith locating placements. Typically, FCW completes a placement\nrequest form with information about the youth and provides it to\nlicensing. A licensing worker then contacts families for placement\nand shares some information about the youth. Supervisor would\nthen schedule a meeting with Youth A’s team and the potential\nfoster parent to discuss the youth’s needs further. FCW was\nuncertain about how this meeting or any phone contact were\ndocumented. FCW was informed that DHHS-3307 Placement\nOutlines, could not be located in Youth A’s file. FCW reported\nusing 3307’s to document the rule requirement. However,\nregarding Youth A, his frequent replacements and escalating\nneeds resulted in FCW getting behind in completing some\npaperwork. FCW stated she was aware she needed to get caught\nup and planned to have Supervisor assist.\nDocuments reviewed:\n3",
    "• Youth A's case file was reviewed on 4/18/23 and found that\nYouth A had six placements over the past eight months.\nNone of the six placements had documentation of\ninformation provided to the foster parent. Typically, this\ninformation is documented on the DHHS 3307 placement\noutline. No 3307's were found in the case file. Case\ncontacts were also reviewed for any documentation of\ninformation provided to the foster parents. However, no\ninformation was found that would satisfy the rule\nrequirement.\n• Placement request document from BCS was reviewed. The\ndocument outlined Youth A's behaviors and needs, which\nwere consistent with information found throughout Youth\nA's case file. However, the form did not document which\nfoster parents this information was provided to.\n• Supervisor provided a spreadsheet, which is used to\ndocument the homes contacted regarding placement.\nHowever, none of the six homes where Youth A was\nplaced, are listed on this spreadsheet.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance as they did not document\nthe mental health or behavioral information that was provided to\nprevious foster parents of Youth A, as required by part (g) of this\nrule. In addition, during a review of the file, it was determined the\nagency did not document that any of the information required by\nparts (a-j) of this rule were provided to foster parents. This was\ntrue for all six of the youth's placements over the past eight\nmonths.\nConclusion REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n12/22/22 RENEWAL, CAP Approved 1/17/23.\n4",
