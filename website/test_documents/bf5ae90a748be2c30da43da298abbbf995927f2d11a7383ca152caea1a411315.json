    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency interim inspection was completed on 7/31/2023 and the CAP was\napproved on 8/29/2023. The agency was cited for 10 violations, 5 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 5, there was an improvement in individual incidents of\nnon-compliance within 2 of the violation areas (medical passports and supervisor\napproval) and a slight increase in number of individual incidents in the other 3\nareas (FTM's, DHS 1105's and PATP's).\nIn 2022, 13 violations were established, 5 of which were repeated this year. One\nof the repeated violations (late USP's) remain close to the same number of\nindividual incidents of non-compliances. There was improvement in the remaining\n4 (FTM's, 1105's, PATP's and medical passports). The agency will need to\nestablish additional corrective planning for the repeated violations to ensure a\nreduction of incidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated the agency faces barriers regarding medicals and dentals due to a lack\nof providers who accept Medicaid as well as client cancellation. The previous CAP\nimplemented has been effective. The agency developed internal tracking\nspreadsheets for licensing as well as FCW/FC supervisor checklists for case\nreviews. In addition, supervisors within the agency have been completing more\nquarterly case reads. Workers have also taken a more active role in assuring\ncasework is completed thoroughly and timely. The agency has been able to\nmaintain foster care staff which has been very beneficial.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisor and coworkers are able to assist as needed.\nStaff reported each individual utilizes their own strategy to monitor due dates. Staff\ndid not report any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nSafety Alert #1: Unlicensed caregiver home has guns that are not secured.\nResolution: Unlicensed caregiver inherited guns after the initial home assessment\nwas completed. They are old guns that unlicensed caregiver reported he had no\nintention of firing and would have as keepsakes. Agency provided trigger locks for\neach gun however unlicensed caregiver opted to store the guns at a relative's home.\nSafety Alert #2: Licensed foster home is missing a bedroom door. In addition, there\nis not a smoke alarm between bedroom and the rest of the home.\nResolution: Agency provided a smoke alarm the day it was discovered they were\nmissing one. A photo was provided as verification. A new door was installed by the\nagency on 5/8/2024. A photo was provided as verification. Due to being a licensed\nfoster home, the agency also opened a special evaluation.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n______6/11/2024______________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6/18/2024\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
