    "STATE OF MICHIGAN\nGRETCHEN WHITMER DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ELIZABETH HERTEL\nGOVERNOR LANSING DIRECTOR\nAugust 15, 2022\nBrian Vogel\nKent County Juvenile Detention Center\n1501 Cedar, NE\nGrand Rapids, MI 49503-1390\nRE: License #: CO410201223\nKent County Juvenile Detention Center\n1501 Cedar, NE\nGrand Rapids, MI 49503-1390\nDear Mr. Vogel:\nThis letter is a follow-up to the Department’s findings regarding the interim inspection\nconducted at your facility on 08/10/2022. The purpose of this inspection was to determine\ncompliance with applicable licensing statutes and administrative rules for Court Operated\nResidential Care Facility.\nYour facility was found to be in compliance with the requirements of Licensing Rules for\nJuvenile Court Operated Facilities.\nAn onsite tour was completed on 08/10/2022. The facility was observed to be clean and well\nmaintained. Ample staff were present and observed to be supervising the residents. This\nconsultant viewed all the pod areas where the youth are residing, and it was observed to be\nclean and well maintained. Residents were attending their onsite schooling during the tour.\nDuring interviews staff reported feeling both staff and residents are safe at the facility and\nsupervision is provided as required. When interviewing staff, they reported they have been\ntrained to have youth out of their rooms as much as possible and restraints are a last resort\ntool when a youth is escalated. They were able to explain to this consultant about the verbal\nde-escalation skills they have learned and techniques to not get into power struggles with\nyouth. One area of growth staff gave feedback on was for leadership to continue to hire\nmore staff for extra support due to the increased number of youth entering the facility. Youth\nreported they feel safe at the facility, and they report feeling respected by staff. They\nreported staff only use their trained restraint model when all other de- escalation skills have\nfailed, and they do not automatically put their hands on a youth. An area of growth youth\nsuggested was staff consistency with expectations. The youth explained there has been\nnewer staff coming to work at the facility that there is not always the same consistency of\nexpectations.",
    "Consultation was provided to the administration team about the feedback from the staff\ninterviews. It was reported the facility is still in the process of hiring more staff for extra\nsupport on the units. Consultation was provided about the increased number of seclusions.\nAdministration reported over the pass year there has been an increased number of\nresidents coming into the facility and some have increased mental health and behavioral\nconcerns. Administration reported they continue to review the number of seclusions and\nrestraints and talk with staff about different techniques to use with the youth. It was also\nreported some youth have been choosing to take time away in their rooms per their own\nrequest and the facility has to note that as a seclusion.\nPlease contact me with any questions. In the event that I am not available, and you need to\nspeak to someone immediately, please contact the area manager, Jessica VandenHeuvel\nat (616) 204-6992.\nSincerely,\nAugust 15, 2022\nCathrine Raftery, Licensing Consultant\nAugust 15, 2022\nJessica VandenHeuvel, Area Manager\n2"
