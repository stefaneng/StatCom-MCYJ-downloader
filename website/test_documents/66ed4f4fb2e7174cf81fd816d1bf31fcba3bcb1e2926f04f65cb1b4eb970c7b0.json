Resident A\nstated she had a \"really bad meeting\" with her Foster Care Worker from about 1pm-\n2:30pm. At approximately 2:45pm, Resident A asked Staff 1 if she could\nshower. According to Resident A, she and another resident share one\nbathroom. Both residents keep basic items like shampoo and soap in the bathroom,\nbut their razors are kept locked in the staff bathroom. Resident A reported that when\nshe went into the shower, she noticed a razor in the bathroom. Resident A\nproceeded to self-harm with the razor. Staff 1 became aware of the self-harming\nwhen Resident A exited the bathroom and said that she needed stitches. Resident\nA stated she was still on 5-minute checks due to previous suicidal thoughts, but staff\nare not allowed to go into the bathroom with them and do not complete 5-minute\nchecks when residents are in the shower. Resident A denied any staff checked on\nher while she was in the bathroom.\n2",
    "Resident A, Resident B and Resident C were interviewed on July 9, 2020. They all\nreported the following:\n Residents hygiene items are stored in their bedroom or bathroom with\nexception to razors.\n Razors are locked in the staff bathroom in a bin labeled with each resident’s\nname\n Residents have to request the razor and return the razor when done.\nStaff 1 was interviewed at the facility on July 1, 2020. Staff 1 stated Resident A was\nupset following a meeting with her Foster Care Worker. Resident A left the house\nbut then returned while Staff 1 was following her. Staff 1 attempted to redirect and\ndistract Resident A offering to go for a walk with her, change the fishbowl, organize\nthe bookshelf, but Resident A continued to be agitated. Resident A asked to take a\nshower. Staff 1 stated another resident was in the bathroom, so she did not let\nResident A into the bathroom. While in the milieu, Staff 1 walked to Resident A’s\nbedroom and noticed she was not there. She talked to Resident A through the\nbathroom door and Resident A stated she was okay. Within five minutes, Resident\nA called for Staff 1. When Staff 1 walked to the bathroom she observed water and\nblood as Resident A had cut her arms. She later located a disposable razor in the\nbathroom that was used. Staff 1 denied providing Resident A with a razor. Staff 1\nasked for staff assistance, and Resident A was provided with medical care and\ntaken to the hospital for further evaluation. Staff 1 stated Resident A was already on\nAt Risk Status due to suicidal ideation. She indicated eyes on checks are not\nperformed when residents are in the bathroom.\nStaff 2 was interviewed at the facility on July 1, 2020. Staff 2 stated she attended a\nFamily Team Meeting with Resident A. Resident A was not happy with the outcome\nof the meeting and became upset. Resident A threaten to AWOL and be defiant.\nResident A then asked for her sketching items including an eraser and pencil\nsharpener. Staff 2 denied providing these items to Resident A as Resident A has\nused these items to self-harm previously. Resident A asked Staff 1 to take a shower\nand was given permission. Staff 2 did not see when Resident A entered the\nbathroom so was not sure who opened the door or what items Resident A had with\nher. Staff 2 stated Staff 1 requested assistance at some point as Resident A had\nused a razor to cut her arms. Staff 2 stated Resident A was on At-Risk Status and\nStaff 1 was assigned to supervise her. Staff 2 described At-Risk Status to mean\nresidents are checked on when sleeping in varying intervals not to exceed 15\nminutes. If awake, staff document what the resident is doing in varying intervals not\nto exceed 30 minutes. Staff 2 reported razors are locked in the staff bathroom and\nneed to be signed out for use.\nI reviewed the video footage of the incident. Resident A was observed at 2:25pm\nstanding outside the closed bathroom door then walking to the milieu area. Another\nresident exited the bathroom at 2:26pm and was walking down the hallway toward\nthe milieu area when Resident A walked back down the hallway to the bathroom\n3",
    "and entered. Staff 1 was observed to walk to the bathroom door at 2:34pm; knocks\non the door and is heard asking Resident A “how are you doing, are you taking a\nshower”. Staff 1 returns to the milieu. Staff 1 walked to the bathroom door again at\n2:41pm, then is seen opening the bathroom door and requesting further staff\nassistance.\nI reviewed the At-Risk Status Procedure that states if the Therapist or Program\nManager determine the need for searches of resident, resident room and bathroom\ncan be completed. The At-Risk Status Procedure later states unless clinically\ninadvisable, resident room and bathroom searches should be completed at least\nonce daily while resident is on At-Risk Status.\nI reviewed Resident A’s status records since she was admitted to the facility on\nJune 9, 2020.\n Resident A was placed on At-Risk Status on June 20, 2020 for AWOLing from\ncampus. The status was terminated on June 21, 2020.\n Resident A was placed on At-Risk Status on June 24, 2020 for self-harm as\nshe reported she ingested 19 pills to kill herself. The At-Risk Status Checklist\nstated an initial bedroom search was completed but no further searches are\nrequired. Specific instructions included eliminating Resident A’s access to\ncords or sharp objects and to complete ten minute or less checks while\nResident A was awake.\no In review of the At-Risk Status Observation Log staff documented\nchecks exceeding 10 minutes from June 24-June 30, 2020 except for\ntwo periods of time. On June 28 from 11:28am to 10:10 pm and June\n30 from 5:35pm-6:55pm staff logged Resident A’s behavior at every\nten-minute increment.\n Resident A continued placement on At-Risk Status on June 30, 2020 for self-\nharm as she used a razor to cut her arm. The At-Risk Status Checklist stated\nan initial bedroom search was completed and daily searches should occur.\nSpecific instructions included eliminating Resident A’s access to sharp\nobjects and to complete five-minute checks per Resident A’s request. Also\nnoted Resident A was allowed use of headphones in her bedroom unless\nstaff have concerns. The status was terminated on July 8, 2020.\nI reviewed Resident A’s safety plans since she was admitted to the facility.\n Safety Plan dated June 23, 2020: Peer Restriction/AWOLP Safety Planning\ndoes not include any actions related to Resident A’s self-harm behavior.\n Safety Plan dated July 10, 2020: Plan includes staff monitoring for warning\nsigns and contacting Therapist if Resident A talks about her desire to self-\nharm or self-harms. Room search will be completed if Resident A self-harms.\nI reviewed the Razor sign in/out sheet, one resident checked out a razor on June 14,\n2020 and it was not checked back in. During an onsite inspection on July 9, 2020, I\nconfirmed all St. John’s Home provided razors were accounted for in Haarmon\nHouse by reviewing their storage in the locked staff bathroom.\n4",
    "I reviewed Student Privacy Policy and Search Procedure which states searches of a\nresidents self, bedroom or bathroom can be conducted when a Therapist indicates the\nnecessity of a search on a one-time, regular or random basis in order to ensure the\nstudent’s safety and security.\nDuring an onsite inspection on July 9, 2020, the bathroom was observed. A hair\nstraightener was in the bathroom. A room search was completed following this and\nthe facility found a hair dryer, curling iron, straightener, manicure set including two\nnail clippers, bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, bottle of nair and a metal\nbottle cap.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed via telephone on July 16, 2020. She reported she was\non call and placed Resident A on At-Risk status, but as she is not the assigned\ntherapist for Resident A she did not remove her from status. Therapist 1 stated the\nfacility’s status and procedures are not effective in ensuring safety of residents as\nincreased supervision is not specifically required. She noted if a resident is not on\nstatus and has a history of self-harming behavior there is no policy allowing for\nrandom or periodic searches. Searches’ are only completed when staff have a\nconcern a resident has contraband or if they are on a status requiring searches.\nTherapist 2 was interviewed via telephone on July 15, 2020. She reported she is the\nassigned therapist for Resident A. A safety plan was developed within the first few\nweeks of Resident A being admitted to the facility as she went AWOL. There was\nalso a recent safety plan due to allegations of inappropriate contact between\nResident A and another resident while off campus. Therapist 2 was unaware of a\nsafety plan that was dated July 10, 2020. Therapist 2 reported residents belongings,\nperson, bedroom or bathroom are searched when returning from AWOL or when\nthey are placed on a status that indicates room searches should be completed. She\nreported Resident A’s status was terminated, so there are currently no requirements\nof room searches for Resident A. Therapist 2 was concerned with the items found in\nResident A’s bedroom on July 9, 2020 indicating those items should not have been\nin any resident’s bedroom as hygiene items are to be stored in the locked staff\nbathroom. Therapist 2 stated the status procedures are not effective as they are\nreactive to a situation and lack proactive/prevention methods prior to the first\noccurrence.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nsupervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency's program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as facility did not provide\nproactive measures or adequate supervision of Resident A to\nensure her continued safety and supervision to meet her needs.\nStaff 2 failed to notify other staff of Resident A’s request for objects\nused to self-harm. Although Staff 1 did check on Resident A while in\nthe bathroom twice, there was no proactive processes in place to\neliminate safety hazards for Resident A. Staff did not document\nResident A’s behavior every ten minutes as indicated on her At-Risk\nStatus Checklist.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSI # 2020C0223022 dated 04/06/20, CAP approval dated 04/28/20\nSI # 2020C0103012 dated 03/24/20, CAP approval dated 04/13/20\nSI # 2018C0103045 dated 12/26/18, CAP approval dated 02/08/19\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe following procedures were reviewed.\n Student Supervision Procedure: The purpose is to keep residents safe and\nsecure.
