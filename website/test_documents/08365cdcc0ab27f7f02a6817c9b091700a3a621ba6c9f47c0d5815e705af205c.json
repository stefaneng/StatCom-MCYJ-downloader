    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance",
    "The agency has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period.\nThe first correction action plan related to the agency’s December 2024 Renewal\ninspection, completed on 12/27/2024 where the CAP was approved on 4/23/2025.\nDuring that inspection the agency received 28 rule violations; of which 14 were\nrepeat violations. Twelve of the 28 citations were ones where 4 to 8 individual\ncases were found in violation for various specific rules; and that inspection’s\nfindings resulted in the agency’s current provisional license.\nDuring this 2025 Renewal inspection, the agency received 10 rule violations, and\nthough 9 are repeat violations, the agency implemented its corrective action plan\nand made significant progress and improvements. 7 of the 9 violations were\npreviously cited during the February 2024 Interim inspection and 5 of the 9\nviolations were previously cited during the December 2024 Renewal inspection. Of\nthe 5 repeat violations from the December 2024 Renewal inspection, the number\nof cases cited decreased for 2 rules cited, remained the same for 2 rules cited and\na slight increase for one rule cited. In 2024 8 of 8 individual child records were\ncited decreasing to 3 of 8 related to Development of service plans during this\ninspection. In 2024 4 of 8 individual records were cited decreasing to 1 of 8 related\nto the Initial service plans during this inspection. The number of cases impacted\nthat remained the same, were 3 of 8 related Medical and dental policy rule; and 1\nof 8 related to a Change of placement rule. There was a slight increase from 19.6\nto 22% for employee performance noncompliance. It is also noted that the\nPlacement rule; Foster Parent Information rule; and the Development of service\nplans rule pertaining to worker and supervisor signatures, which the agency had\nsignificant difficulty with during the 2024 Renewal inspection, the agency was in\ncompliance with these rule during this inspection. The agency reported it had\nregular and ongoing reviews, and discussions on how to make progress on this\ncorrective plan; and the progress was illustrated per this inspection.\nThe second corrective action plan was related to special Investigation\n2025SIC000332 initiated 1/27/2025 that alleged a foster care worker threatened\nand fought with a foster youth after the youth called them a name. The agency\nwas found in noncompliance after interviews as well as video evidence showed\nthe foster care worker engaged in a physical altercation with the youth. There was\nno evidence to support the foster care worker’s report that they acted in self-\ndefense. The agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan that was\napproved on 3/31/2025; which included the foster worker’s separation from the\nagency, supervisory shadowing of workers in the community, and mandatory de-\nescalation training for all staff. The agency’s corrective action plan remains active,\nand the agency is complying with it.\nThe third corrective action plan related to Special Investigation 2025SIC0000411\ninitiated 2/28/2025, related to an allegation that the agency placed a youth in\nanother agency’s foster home without notifying the agency; and that action put the\nfoster home over the home’s approved licensing capacity. The investigation found",
    "the agency in noncompliance of the borrowed home rule. Despite some confusion\ndue to who was in communication with whom; no communication occurred with\nthe agency’s licensing department or the foster home’s certifying agency’s\nlicensing department to ensure appropriate borrowed bed forms were completed\nprior to the child’s placement. The agency submitted an acceptable corrective\naction plan that was approved on 4/18/2025. The corrective action plan included\nall foster care workers and supervisor’s reviewing the borrowed home rules; and\nfoster care workers and children protective service staff reviewing and completing\na borrowed bed agreement prior to placement of a child in another agency’s foster\nhome. The agency’s corrective action plan remains active, and the agency is\ncomplying with it.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 8/28/2025. The chief\nadministrator (CA) reported on the prior year's violations, and the action steps it\nput in place to achieve compliance. The CA indicated all aspects of the corrective\naction plan were adhered to, monitored, reviewed, and followed up on to achieve\nand maintain compliance. Foster care workers and supervisors consistently used\nthe reports that are available from both the Data Warehouse and their individual\nBook of Business to monitor compliance of foster care Key Performance Indicators\n(KPI). Additionally, workers and supervisors had additional support from the\nagency’s MiTEAM Quality Assurance Analysts and training throughout the year.\nFurthermore, all staff hires, training, and performance review dates are monitored\non a spreadsheet; where reminders and follow-up are ongoing to ensure\ncompletion and documentation is received. The CA also reported that the\nagency’s foster care caseloads are monitored weekly to maintain prescribed\ncaseload compliance.\nThe agency noted they have monthly case conferences, and supervisors, section\nmanagers, the CA and quality assurance analysts conduct monthly KPI meetings\nwith the foster care units to discuss performance and policy compliance amongst\nits strengths. The agency reported it shall continue all efforts to improve and\nachieve ongoing rule compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the current chief administrator, section manager,\nadministrative assistant and other administrative staff, three foster workers and\none supervisor was interviewed. The staff interviewed reported numerous\nstrengths and positives attributes for the agency; which included, management\nlistening to them; support from their immediate supervisor and other supervisors;\nstaff being passionate about their jobs and promoting and listening to parents;\nchief administrator holding staff responsible keeping staff abreast of the agency’s\nprogress or lack thereof; chief administrator open door policy, working with staff to\nimprove, CA celebrating staff; and improved staff morale. As for areas of",
    "improvement needed, staff reported a desire for more program, and task specific\ntrainings (i.e. placement changes, accessing resources for families); training on\nhow to navigate MISACWIS; having a lead worker to help guide and train new\nstaff; ways to train families on how to access resources themselves; and more\nbuilding safety protocol for the security of all staff.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nMy walk through in the agency's office showed the agency has sufficient space\nand equipment for its staff. The agency has gone paperless, and so current\nrecords are electronic files, and closed paper files are properly stored. A large\nnumber of closed foster care and adoption files that have been sent over from\nvarious child placing agencies to this departmental office were seen onsite; and a\nlarge number of these files were not stored in a secured/locked area as cited\nabove.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two safety alerts identified.\nSafety Alert #1: There were no operable smoke detector on the second floor of the\nhome and no operable carbon monoxide detector in the home. Three of the children\nare sleeping in the basement. A broken bunk bed, full size bed, and a crib was\nobserved. The basement does not have egress windows.\nResolution: On 9/12/2025 the agency staff installed two new smoke/carbon\nmonoxide combination detectors, one on each level of the home. Photos were\nattached showing the detectors installed. The agency advised the caregiver had\nreported the foster children were sleeping in the two upstairs beds. On 9/4/2025 the\ncaregiver and mother reported the children’s beds had been broken; and\nreplacements were needed. The agency purchased new beds and provided them on\n9/6/2025; however, the beds had not been assembled by the caregiver or mother.\nOn 9/12/2025 the agency staff assembled the children’s beds in the designated\nupstairs bedrooms. Photographs were provided showing the beds in place.\nAdditionally, a written safety plan was completed with the family related to it being\nmandatory for the children to sleep upstairs. A copy of the safety plan was\nprovided.\nSafety Alert # 2: There were no operable carbon monoxide detector in the home.\nResolution: The agency reported during home visit on 08/11/2025 a combination\nsmoke/carbon monoxide detector had been observed in the home. Additionally, the\nagency reported after receiving this safety alert on 9/16/2025 their staff learned from\nthe caregiver that the carbon monoxide detector was no longer present in the home\ndue to the caregiver removing it because it activated while they were cooking. On\n9/16/2025 agency staff conducted a follow-up visit with the family and installed a\nnew combination detector. A safety plan was also developed with the family. A photo",
    "showing that the smoke/carbon monoxide detector was installed, was provided,\nalong with a copy of the safety plan.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nSeptember 19, 2025\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 19, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
