The first floor is made\nup of several classrooms, case managers’ offices, a large kitchen, and dining room\narea. The classrooms will be used by the Bridgeway residents as well as the children\nthrough the Transitional Foster Care Program. The case managers’ office is a large\nopen space with cubical/desk space for the case managers of the Bridgeway program.\nThe dining room area has seating for approximately 50 and has several small tables\nand chairs as well as booth like seating along the wall. The dining area is separated\nfrom the kitchen area by a doorway and a large serving window that has a rolldown fire\ndoor.
