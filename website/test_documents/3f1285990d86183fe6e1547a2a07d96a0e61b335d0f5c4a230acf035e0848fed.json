    "I reviewed video footage at the facility, on 02/01/2023, in\ncollaboration with the DHHS Specialist. The video date is\n01/25/2022 at 3:50 pm in the hallway off the living room. Video\nhas no audio. Youth A and Staff 1 are seen interacting and Youth\nA is holding a notepad. Youth A appears to be agitated and pacing\naround Staff 1. Youth A throws the notepad at Staff 1, Staff 1\ncatches the notepad, and Youth A attempts to grab at Staff 1.\nStaff 1 appears to be trying to block Youth A from hitting and\ngrabbing her. Youth A grabs Staff 1 wrist and Staff 1 grabs Youth\nA’s wrist to release Youth A’s hold on her. Youth A is seen running\ndown the hallway.

Report was\nconsistent with Staff 1’s interview.\n• Staff 1’s employee file, No disciplinary action reports.\n• Reviewed facility’s Behavior Management Policies and\nPractices. While a wide variety of consequences may be used,\nthese are never to be excessively punitive or self-defeating. Staff\nare trained in CPI and are to use block or deflect the weapon\nwhen a youth hits them.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as the video evidence, and\nstaff and youth interviews, support that Staff 1 did not punch or hit\nYouth A during the incident. Youth A has a history of making false\naccusations per her Foster Care Specialist.\nConsultation:\nThe facility was advised to remind staff when a youth is physically\ncombative to move away from the youth to avoid physical contact\nand prevent a power struggle.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
