Youth B\nreported Youth A slid him the edible under the table inside the\nrestaurant and later handed one to Youth C after Staff 1 got up\nfrom the table.

RM reported currently working with Staff 1 on becoming\nmore trauma-informed and enhancing communication with youth.\n3",
    "RM also referenced a separate incident involving a former youth\nwho brought a vape pen during intake in July. The vape was\nreportedly confiscated at that time. Later, during a room search,\nanother vape was found in the youth’s bedroom, which he brought\nin from the community. RM reported this youth has since been\ndischarged, and the incident did not involve Staff 1.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nStaff 1 personnel File: There was no disciplinary record and Staff\n1 completed Boundaries in the Treatment Relationship training on\n06/20/25, a client’s experience in trauma informed care training on\n06/13/25.\nLight House Employee Handbook: The Code of Ethical Conduct\noutlines the core beliefs, principles, and values staff and\nvolunteers should uphold, guiding their actions and decisions.\nLight house enforces a zero-tolerance policy for intentional illegal\nor unethical behavior, while unintentional acts perceived as such\nresult in appropriate disciplinary action. Staff must protect clients\nby maintaining clear, appropriate, and culturally sensitive\nboundaries, especially regarding conflicts of interest.\nSmoke Free Environment Policy: Lighthouse maintains a strict\nsmoke-free environment for all employees and visitors, prohibiting\nsmoking and vaping of any tobacco or related products inside all\nenclosed areas of its facilities and on all property, including\nresidential program areas and employer vehicles. Smoking is only\npermitted at least 50 feet away from any building entrance. All\nsmoking materials must be properly extinguished and disposed of,\nand failure to keep designated smoking areas clean may result in\ntheir removal by management.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance, as there is insufficient\nevidence to support a rule violation. Youth A alleged that Staff 1\ntook and consumed an edible provided by Youth A. However,\nYouth B, who was also present, reported that Staff 1 saw the\nedibles but did not consume them and instead warned the youth\nagainst using them. Staff 1 denied both seeing the edibles and\nconsuming them with the youth. Further, interviews with other staff\nraised no concerns about Staff 1’s conduct, and there are no prior\nreports or disciplinary actions involving similar behavior.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\n4",
    "Based on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n08/27/2025\n______________________________________\nErica Marshall Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n09/04/2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n5"
