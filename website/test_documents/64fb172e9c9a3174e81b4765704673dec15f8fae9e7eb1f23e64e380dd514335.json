The Chief Administrator stated there is not a formal\npolicy regarding the locking of doors such as the control rooms\nwithin the units, but as a secure facility many doors automatically\nlock, and staff are trained to ensure they do. She also stated it is\ncommon for staff to not attempt to enter a control room within a\nunit if there is any concern over youth behavior or escalation.\nYouth A was interviewed during a face-to-face, unannounced visit\nto the facility on 07/08/2024. He recalled the incident where he\nwas able to get into the control room of the unit. Youth A stated\nStaff 1 “did her job” and that he was just able to get in to the\ncontrol room. He stated that, after being in the control room, he\nwas able to get out of the unit and the incident escalated to the\npoint of him being restrained by staff. Youth A was not sure how\nhe was able to get out of the side door of the unit. Youth A stated\nthe restraint itself was not of concern to him. While inside the\ncontrol room, Youth A stated nothing significant occurred. He\nrecalled Staff 1 being in there with him and she told him to get out\nof the room repeatedly. He also recalled Staff 1 calling for\nsecurity assistance at that time before he ran out of the room.\nYouth A stated there were no other staff within the unit at the time.\n2",
