She was also told Staff 1 did a dance move, where\nhe raised his arms above his head in a “V” and brought both arms\ndown at the same time to his private area. Therapist 1 reported to\nParent 2 that she would look into the matter. Therapist 1 reported\ndue to the nature of the allegations, she reported this to\nAdministrator 1 and Clinical Director 1. Therapist 1 reported two\nweeks later Youth A recanted his allegation and stated Staff 1\naccidently touched him.\nThe following interviews were completed on 2/19/25 at the\nfacility with the MDHHS Worker.\nStaff 1 reported he has never had any issues with Youth A. Staff 1\nreported Youth A can be violent and gets into fights with the other\nyouth in the unit. Staff 1 reported Youth A was listening to\ninappropriate music while in the unit and he asked him to turn the\nvolume down. Staff 1 reported all the youth have MP3 players, but\nthey are able to connect it to the Bluetooth speaker or radio in\ntheir room. Youth A will put his music on at night and raise the\nvolume so others can hear. Staff 1 reported any time he has\nasked Youth A to turn the volume down he has complied. Staff 1\ndenied touching any youth inappropriately. Staff 1 reported he has\ntouched youth but not in an intentionally harming way or sexually\ngratifying way. Staff 1 reported Youth A has never said to him,\n3",
    "“don’t touch me” or told him that he felt uncomfortable around him.\nStaff 1 reported he does not play inappropriate music around the\nyouth, including Tamika Fabulous. Staff 1 reported he has never\nsaid inappropriate sexual comments to any youth. Staff 1 reported\nhe has not danced inappropriately around children (in reference to\nhand gestures towards his penis.)

Both reported Staff 1 is a good staff\nwho engages in activities with the youth. Both reported they have\nnever had complaints from the youth regarding Staff 1.\nVideo Observation:\nVideo was not saved and therefore could not be reviewed. Email\non 1/23/25 from Administrator 1 to MDHHS Worker and myself\nreported: “We reviewed the video, there was nothing seen of note.\nUnfortunately, the video has no audio, and we retain videos for\nthirty days…”\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Supervision for Success document: “It was brought to my\nattention on 12/20/24 that Staff 1 was horseplaying with a\nyouth. It was discussed with Staff 1 via phone that staff are\nnot to at any time horseplay with youth within the program.\nIt was also discussed that staff are to always remain\nprofessional and keep healthy boundaries within the\nworkplace…” This was dated 12/23/24 and completed by\nAdministrator 1.\n• Staff schedule was reviewed and noted Staff 1 working with\nYouth A’s unit on 12/15/24 and 12/18/24. These two dates\nwere the closest scheduled shifts to the allegations. Both\nSupervisor 1 and Supervisor 2 were scheduled with Staff 1\non these dates.\n• Staff 1’s personnel file was reviewed. All clearances and\ntraining were up to date.\n• There was not an incident report to review of the situation.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as Youth A and Staff 1 both\ndeny Staff 1 ever touched Youth A in a sexual manner. There is\n4",
    "no evidence to validate Staff 1 stating inappropriate sexual\ncomments towards Youth A. Staff 1 denied the allegations; Youth\nB and Youth C reported they had never heard Staff 1 say anything\nsexually inappropriate to any of the youth; and both Supervisor 1\nand Supervisor 2 denied ever hearing Staff 1 make comments in\nthis manner.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4131 Compliance with child protection law;\nSection development of plan required.\nDescription (1) The licensee shall develop and implement a written plan to\nassure compliance with the child protection law, 1975 PA 238,\nMCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The agency failed to report suspected child abuse and neglect as\noutlined in the child protection law.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nParent 1 and Parent 2 were interviewed separately on the\ntelephone on 2/24/25. Both reported Youth A told them a staff\nmember says “inappropriate things” to him. Both did not know the\nactual words spoken. Both reported Youth A told them the staff\nmade sexual gestures towards his own (staff’s) penis. The gesture\nwas not explained to them. Both reported Youth A reported to\nthem the staff would rub his lower back in a sexual manner. This\nmade Youth A uncomfortable. It was reported to them Youth A\ntold a staff member (unknown) about this behavior.\nParent 2 reported he told Therapist 1 the allegations Youth A\nreported to him. Parent 2 reported Therapist 1 stated she would\nlook into the matter.\nAll interviews at the facility included the MDHHS Worker.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed on 2/4/25 at the facility. Therapist 1\nreported Parent 2 was on site for a family visit. Parent 2 reported\nto her Youth A alleged Staff 1 had touched him in a sexually\ninappropriate way on his back, which made Youth A\nuncomfortable. She was also told Staff 1 did a dance move, where\nhe raised his arms above his head in a “V” and brought both arms\ndown to his private area at the same time. Therapist 1 reported to\nParent 2 that she would look into the matter. Therapist 1 reported\ndue to the nature of the allegations, she reported this to\nAdministrator 1 and Clinical Director 1. Therapist 1 described that\nit was her role to notify her supervisors as a mandated reported.\n5",
    "Therapist 1 reported she felt this allegation raised to the level of\nother parties to be involved. Therapist 1 reported she is to report\nsuspected child abuse and neglect when there is threat of\nsomeone getting hurt or if someone is getting hurt sexually.\nTherapist 1 reported she told Clinical Director 1 and Administrator\n1 as her due diligence as a mandated reported. Therapist 1 did\nnot know if either called the allegations into centralized intake.\nTherapist 1 was reinterviewed on the telephone on 2/24/25 and\nshe reported again that she told Administrator 1 and Clinical\nDirector 1 the allegations. Therapist 1 reported she did not write\nan incident report for the allegations or case note the\nconversations.\nClinical Director 1 was interviewed on 2/19/25 at the facility.\nClinical Director reported he had a conversation with Therapist 1\nconcerning Staff 1 and Youth A. He reported Therapist 1 stated\nYouth A complained about a “look” he received from Staff 1. This\nlook made him feel uncomfortable. Clinical Director 1 reported he\ndoes not remember Therapist 1 telling him the allegations were\nconcerning a touch alleged to be sexual. Clinical Director 1 was\nasked what the mandated reporting policy says. He reported staff\nare to tell him about any allegations and then he would make the\nphone call to centralized intake. Clinical Director 1 reported the\nstaff would report anything that puts youth in harms way. This\ncould be unsafe mentally or physically.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed on 2/4/25 at the facility.\nAdministrator 1 reported Therapist 1 gave her information that\nYouth A made allegations against Staff 1. The allegations were\nthat Staff1 had an inappropriate conversation with Youth A.\nAdministrator 1 was unable to recall what the conversation was\nabout. She also was told Staff 1 gave Youth A a pat on the back\nthat made him feel uncomfortable because it was too low. The\nlocation on the back was described as the middle. Administrator 1\nreported the pat was not described as sexual to her.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the Reporting Policy:\nThe staff member receiving the report of actual or\nsuspected sexual abuse or rape must immediately call\nChild Protective Services and report the incident and/or\nallegation. Staff receiving the report of actual or suspected\nabuse…must submit an Incident Report before the end of\ntheir work shift…\n• An incident report was requested for the allegations, but\nthere was not one completed.\n6",
    "• I reviewed Therapist 1’s training file. Therapist 1 received\ntraining on Mandated Reporting on 9/25/24.\nAnalysis The agency is in violation of this rule. Therapist 1 received\ninformation involving Youth A allegedly being touched sexually.\nTherapist 1 reported she thought providing this information to\nAdministrator 1 and Clinical Director 1 would suffice as a\nmandated reporter. The agency did not follow their incident report\nwriting policy.\nTechnical Assistance:\nBased on interviews, there is some confusion on who is to report\nsuspected abuse and neglect as well as what is to be\ndocumented. There was also a miscommunication or\nmisunderstanding of information from Therapist 1 to Clinical\nDirector 1 and Administrator 1. A training would be helpful to\ndiscuss requirements of mandate reporting, including what is to be\nreported, whom the information is to be shared with, and how to\nreport the information due to the serious nature of allegations.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation The agency does not have a policy or procedures concerning the\nusage of technology which includes music. Because of this Youth\nA was able to have and listen to music outside the treatment\nmilieu (trauma-focused).\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAll interviews at the facility include the MDHHS Worker.\nAdministrator 1 as interviewed on 2/4/25 at the facility.\nAdministrator 1 reported Youth A was listening to “Sexy Redd” in\nthe unit. Administrator 1 reported Staff 1 had turned down Youth\nA’s music due to it being inappropriate music. Administrator 1\nreported many youths will download inappropriate music when they\nare at school or at the library. If staff discover the inappropriate\nmusic, they will ask the youth to delete the music from their MP3\nplayer. Administrator 1 was unsure if anyone deleted it from Youth\nA’s MP3.\n7",
    "Staff 1 was interviewed on 2/4/25 at the facility. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A listens to inappropriate music and he has asked him to\nturn the volume down. Staff 1 reported the youth have MP3 players\nbut can also connect it to the Bluetooth speaker or radio in their\nroom. Youth A will put his music on at night and raise the volume.\nStaff 1 reported any time he has asked Youth A to turn the volume\ndown he has complied. Staff 1 reported he does not know what\nmusic the youth are allowed to listen to at the facility and has not\nreported the music to any other staff or supervision.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed on 2/19/25 at the facility. Supervisor\n1 reported the youth are not allowed to have inappropriate music\non their MP3 players. Supervisor 1 defined inappropriate as\nprofanity and explicit lyrics. Supervisor 1 reported the agency has\n“kid friendly” internet at the facility to stop inappropriate\ndownloading. Supervisor 1 reported the units used to have just\nradios in them, but the last two years youth have been given MP3\nplayers, so it is harder to monitor music. Supervisor 1 reported\nYouth A is explosive, and staff have to pick their battles with him. If\nstaff confront Youth A on his music, he will explode. Supervisor 1\nreported Youth A tests limits and attempts to portray himself as the\nvictim in situations. Supervisor 1 reported the youth in the unit are\ncognitively lower-functioning and the music exposes them to lyrics\nthey do not understand. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A listens to\n“Sexy Redd.” Supervisor 1 reported the music Youth A listens to\nwould make one “blush.”\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed on 2/19/25 at the facility. Supervisor\n2 reported youth can listen to music. Supervisor 2 reported the\nmusic is downloaded by the therapist. Supervisor 2 reported the\npolicy for music is no profanity or vulgarities. Supervisor 2 reported\nthat if the staff hear inappropriate music, then they are to turn the\nmusic off, confiscate the MP3 and erase the music and report it to\nthe therapist.\nClinical Director 1 was interviewed on 2/19/25 at the facility. He\nreported the therapist download music for the youth. He reported\nthe agency does not have a specific policy on music for youth.\nClinical Director 1 reported it is the youths’ “universal right” to be\nable to listen to music. Clinical Director 1 reported the music could\nbe downloaded if it was the “clean version.” The clean version was\ndescribed as no profanity or anything explicit. Clinical Director 1\nreported it has been brought to their attention that youth will\ndownload music when at school or at the library. Clinical Director 1\n8",
    "reported if there was inappropriate music being played, they would\nhave the youth delete the song and then discuss it with them.\nParent 1 and Parent 2 were both interviewed via telephone on\n2/24/25 and both reported they have blocks on the music that\nYouth A is allowed to listen to. Both reported Youth A is not\nallowed to listen to “Sexy Redd in their home.” Parent 2 reported\nthat music is a “disgrace.”\nWorker 1 was interviewed via telephone on 2/24/25. Worker 1\nreported Youth A was cognitively eight or nine years old. Worker 1\nreported Youth A came into care with concerns on usage of\ninternet and YouTube. Worker 1 reported he likes to listen to\ninappropriate music and was caught watching videos of “Sexy\nRedd” in the hospital. The videos showed women with limited\nclothing and smacking the backsides of each other. These videos\nwere taken from him. Worker 1 reported Therapist 1 downloads\nYouth A’s music for him.\nYouth A was interviewed on 2/4/25 at the facility. Youth A reported\nhe has music from “Sexy Redd” on his MP3. He stated two songs;\n“Fat, Juicy, and Wet” and “Baby I love you”.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed on 2/24/25 via telephone. Therapist 1\nreported she downloads the music for Youth A. Therapist 1\nreported Youth A is at a 11-12 cognitive functioning. Therapist 1\nreported she has downloaded music from “Gorilla” and “Sexy\nRedd.” Therapist 1 reported she does not listen to the entirety of\nthe lyrics when downloading the music. Therapist 1 reported she\nmakes sure the lyrics are the clean versions. Therapist 1 reported\nthis meant no profanity. Therapist 1 reported there is not a policy\nconcerning music.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I requested policies and procedures concerning music. The\nagency provided me with the following:\no Job Role Responsibilities policy: This policy states\nthat staff are to be “role models,” maintain\n“professional boundaries,” and “provide proper\nsupervision so that the care, welfare, safety, and\nsecurity of the residents are ensured.” This policy did\nnot have procedures that outlined electronic devices.\no Supervision Policy: This policy discussed being able\nto visually see youth and audibly hear youth.\n9",
    "o I requested a “recreation policy” and received the Off-\nGround policy. This policy did not pertain to policy\nand procedures concerning electronic devices.\no Television, Movies, and Video Games Policy:\nAs part of the design of the therapeutic milieu,\nconsideration must be given to the influence that\ntelevision and movies has on the treatment of those\nindividuals within the milieu…All television shows,\nmovies, and video games must be monitored for their\ncontent. Television shows, video games, and movies\nthat depict violence, violent images, sex,\nconsumption or usage of substances, and have\nprofanity or lewd language are prohibited. For young\npeople who are 12 years of age or older, they may be\npermitted to watch PG-13 movies. Those movies\nshould be approved by the Assistant Cottage\nSupervisor and should not contain any scenes\ndepicting sex or sexual violence.\n• I reviewed Lyrics of “Sexy Redd” song, “Fat, Juicy, and\nWet.” I was unable to find lyrics for “Baby I love you.” The\nlyrics included sexually explicit activities and lewd language.\n• I reviewed the Program Statement: The treatment\nphilosophy of MCHS’ residential treatment program is based\non a trauma-focused, whole system approach to the\ntherapeutic milieu…one of the major goals is to provide\ntreatment that effectively meets the emotional, cognitive,\nsocial and developmental needs for the youth in care.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance as it does not have a policy\nor procedures pertaining to downloading music and monitoring it.\nStaff 1, Supervisor 2, Supervisor 3, Clinical Director 1, and\nTherapist 1 all had different procedures on downloading music\nand monitoring it. Staff 1, Supervisor 1 and Supervisor 2 reported\nthe music as inappropriate, and Therapist 1 reported she\ndownloaded “Sexy Redd” and did not listen to all the lyrics. The\nagency does have a policy pertaining to “Television, Movies, and\nVideo Games.” This policy, although not directly discussing music,\ndoes speak to ensuring youth are safe guarded against “movies\nthat depict violence, violent images, sex, consumption or usage of\nsubstances, and have profanity or lewd language are prohibited.\nFor young people who are 12 years of age or older, they may be\npermitted to watch PG-13 movies.” The music downloaded onto\nYouth A’s MP3 speak of sexual activities and lewd language. Both\nare prohibited in visual and auditory electronics, as noted in policy\ndue to the treatment milieu (trauma-informed environment) and\ninfluence they have.\n10",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered for the agency to update their\ncurrent “Television, Movies, and Video Games Policy” or include a\nnew policy with procedures for music. The procedures for\ndownloading and monitoring will need to be outlined. The policy\nshould emphasize a trauma informed approach as outlined in the\nprogram statement. Because there has not been a policy or\nprocedure for the downloading of the music, the agency will need\nto evaluate what has been downloaded onto youth who do have\nMP3 players and ensure the music is in agreement with their\nProgram Statement.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2024C0001042SI; CAP approved 5/7/24\nSIR 2024C0001088SI; CAP approved 7/22/24\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n3/13/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
