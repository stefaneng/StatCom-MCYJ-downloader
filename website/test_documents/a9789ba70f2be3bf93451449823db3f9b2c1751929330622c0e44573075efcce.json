He stated being employed by the facility for\neight years and working the night of 01/30/2020 from 02:00-10:00pm.

Staff Person 1 stated 15-minute bed checks are\nnot only for bedtime and are required for when residents are not in staffs direct\nvisual contact to include shower time.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed onsite on 03/06/2020. She stated being employed with\nthe facility for two and a half years and has been Resident A’s therapist for the last\neight months.

He recalls Supervisor sitting at the control board at 07:00pm upon\narriving for his shift when the call came in regarding Resident A. Security 1 stated\nhe was most likely operating the control board prior to Supervisor arriving from\nbetween 03:00pm until 07:00pm. He indicates that from the control room he can\nobserve all the hallways and pods, via security camera system, and can remotely\nopen doors throughout the facility. Pod C has cameras inside the bedrooms that\ncan be monitored from the control room for residents expressing suicidal ideations\nand other problematic behaviors. He stated control room staff do not need to\ncontinuously monitor suicidal residents on pod C as staff sit at the resident’s doors\nand visually check on the them every five minutes. Security 1 stated the facility does\nnot have written policies or procedures regarding the operation of the control room\nand that he learned the position through shadowing other staff.

She stated cameras that are covered are\neasy to identify on the monitors during the day though would be difficult to observe\nat night.\nFacility Director stated the facility does not have written policies or procedures\nrelated to control room operations.\n4",
    "Video surveillance of pod C dated 01/30/2020 starting at 06:20pm was reviewed with\nDetective. The following was observed:\n06:20pm Staff Person 2 begins placing monitoring forms on each\nbedroom door and handing each resident a hygiene box\nbefore going inside their bedrooms.\n06:24pm Resident A is escorted onto the pod by a security staff.\nResident A picks up his journal from the floor and proceeds\nto walk into his bedroom and closes the door.\n06:25pm Resident A places a privacy guard over the bottom portion of\nhis door window and the top is open.\n06:26pm Staff Person 1 enters the pod and speaks with Staff Person\n2.\n06:27pm Staff Person 2 exits the pod and Staff Person 1 sits down\nnear Resident A’s bedroom door.\n06:48pm Resident A takes down his privacy guard from his door\nwindow and then puts it up again.\n06:49 - 06:52pm Shadowed movements through Resident A’s privacy\nguard are observed.\n06:52pm Staff Person 1 walks to room #4.\n06:54pm Staff Person 1 sits, and a large shadow is observed moving\nthrough Resident A’s privacy guard.\n06:59:02pm A resident comes out of shower and enters room #4.\n06:59:21pm Staff Person 1 opens Resident A’s bedroom door.\n07:00:24pm Staff Person 1 enters Resident A’s bedroom.\n07:00:43pm Manager 1 and Security 3 enters Resident A’s bedroom.\n07:03pm Additional staff enter Resident A’s bedroom with defibulator.\n07:19pm Emergency services arrives.\nSecond video surveillance from inside room # 5 on pod C, dated 01/30/2020 at\n03:46pm was reviewed. The following was observed:\n5",
    "03:46pm Resident A wets toilet paper and begins throwing it at the\ncamera lens positioned inside of his bedroom.\n07:01pm Manager 1 removes wet toilet paper away from camera lens\n07:01pm Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is being administered to\nResident A.\nResident A’s case record was reviewed and the following noted: Admitted on\n02/07/2019, health assessment questionnaire notes attempted hanging in 2018,\n12/29/2019 Youth health referral notes scratches to left arm from broom and denied\nsuicidal thoughts/intents. Suicidal precautions logging form dated 10/17/2019 notes\nResident A having tied a shirt around neck resulting in five-minute checks from staff\nand follow up with therapist.\nStaff-to-Resident Ratio policy was reviewed. It stated, “In order to provide for the\nbest care and welfare of the residents, at all times, the ratio of direct care workers to\nresidents, during normal waking hours, shall be no less than one worker to ten\nresidents. The normal staffing pattern will be two workers to eleven residents.\nWhen residents are asleep, staff shall perform variable interval visual checks of\nresidents. The time interval checks shall not exceed fifteen minutes. This ratio shall\nensure the continual safety, protection, and direct care and supervision of the\nresidents.\nThe facility stated Resident A being currently placed with his adoptive mother after\nplacement in intensive care and then in rehabilitation. Resident A is speaking\nthough will require further occupational therapy. He is prescribed medications for\ndepression and nerve damage.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval\nchecks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: Video surveillance shows that staff persons 1 did not perform\neye-on checks of residents every fifteen minutes as required.\nResident A enters the pod and then his bedroom at 06:24pm. It\nis noted that programming requires residents to enter their\nbedrooms at 06:30pm at which time individual showers begin.\nVariable interval eye-on checks should have occurred on 06:39\nand 06:54pm given Resident A’s entry into his bedroom at\n06:24pm. Resident A is observed taking down his privacy guard\nfrom his door window and then puts it up again at 06:48pm. It is\nalso noted that a shadow is observed behind Resident A’s\nprivacy guard at 06:54pm indicating his movement inside the\nbedroom.\nStaff Person 1 does not perform an eye-on check of resident A\nuntil he opens Resident A’s door at 06:59pm. Staff Person 1\nenters Resident A’s bedroom at 07:00pm to discover him sitting\non his bed slumped forward with a piece of bedsheet around his\nneck.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Staff qualifications.\n(1) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nANALYSIS: Staff Person 1 was trained and aware of licensing rules and\ntheir duties regarding monitoring residents every 15-minutes\nwhen not under direct supervision to include shower time and\nwhen not sleeping. Failure to monitor the residents as\ndescribed per rule demonstrated an inability to perform the\nduties of the position.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nANALYSIS: The facility does not have written policies and procedures\nregarding the operation of the control room which monitors all\nresident movement throughout the facility, including inside the\nbedrooms on pod C. Per staff interviewed, video monitoring of\nresidents inside pod C bedrooms is not required, even for\nresidents on suicide watch, as staff on the pod are positioned\noutside the resident’s door. Policies and procedures regarding\nthe use of the video monitoring system, to include inside the\nbedrooms, must be developed regarding service delivery and\nstaff expectations.\nResident A placed wet toilet paper over the camera lens inside\nhis bedroom at 03:46pm and was not discovered and taken\ndown until 07:01pm. Security 1 states he did not recall\nobserving Resident A’s monitor being obstructed by toilet paper\nand states if he had observed such blockage would have called\nfor supervisor assistance.\nThe facility’s written staff-to-resident ratio policy does not\naddress variable interval visual checks of residents when\noutside of the direct supervision of staff during non-sleep times.\nIt is, however, noted that staff interviewed acknowledges 15-\nminute bed checks of residents are not exclusive to sleep time.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n8",
