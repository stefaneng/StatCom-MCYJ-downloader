Youth A has marks on her neck from this\nevent. Youth A went to school where they noticed the marks.\nAccording to staff, she should have been checked by staff every\n10 minutes throughout the night.\nInvestigation Administrator 1/Complainant 1 was interviewed via phone, on\n5/18/2023. She reported being aware of the allegations and Youth\nA is currently lodged in a psychiatric hospital because of self-\nharming behavior.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n5/18/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nknowing of the incident and understanding school officials\nobserved bruising on Youth A’s neck. Youth A told school officials\nshe had attempted to harm herself overnight. The school\n2",
    "contacted the facility with Therapist and Staff 2 going to the school\nto take Youth A to the hospital where she was admitted.\nAdministrator 2 also reported this is the second attempt at self-\nharm resulting in Youth A being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.\nBecause of the prior attempt at self-harm and her return to the\nfacility on 5/1/23, Youth A was on increase supervision involving\nfive-minute room checks. Because of her positive behavior\nchanges, this was changed to ten-minute checks on 5/12/23. The\nsafety plan outlining this information is reviewed below.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed again via phone, on 6/1/2023.\nHe reported Youth A had returned to the facility on 5/24/2023 but\nwent AWOL from school on 5/31/2023. Youth A is currently lodged\nin the hospital again waiting transfer to a psychiatric hospital. He\nwill provide updated information on the situation. Administrator 2\nreported when staff are documenting on the precautions flow\nsheet, they will only document if finding and removing something\nfrom Youth A’s room when they conduct room checks.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n5/18/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nunderstanding the purpose of the interview and did not find out\nabout Youth A’s self-harming behaviors until the next day. She\nreported being the third shift staff present on the night of 5/14/23\nand responsible for Youth A the night Youth A had the cord\naround her neck. Staff 1 completed the room checks “no more\nthan ten-minutes apart and variable”. Staff 1 described her room\nchecks, “Youth A looked like she was sleeping, and her blanket\nwas covering her neck. I could see her whole face and I watched\nfor her chest to rise and fall so I knew she was breathing.\nSometimes she would move her head side to side, and I would\nwatch her for a several seconds before leaving the room.” Staff 1\nreported Youth A was asleep when she started her shift, and she\nwas not informed of any situation during the day with Youth A that\nwould cause concern. Staff 1 acknowledge Youth A was on\nprecautions because of her risk for self-harm. Staff 1 also reported\nYouth A was awake at 6:30 am but when asked if she wanted to\nget up for a shower, “Youth A acted like she was sleeping and\nrefused to respond”. Staff 1 checked on her every ten-minutes\nbefore changing to five-minute checks. Staff 2 attempted to get\nYouth A to get up but failed in her attempts. She described her\nattempts as raising her voice, turning on the lights, and shaking\nthe bed. Both Staff 1 and Staff 2 shook the bed and Youth A finally\nresponded twenty minutes later. Youth A refused to take a shower\naround 7:00 am. Staff 1 reported not observing any marks on\nYouth A and Youth A said nothing about feeling upset or injured.\n3",
    "Staff 1 did notice Youth A appeared to be moving slower than\nnormal before Staff 2 took Youth A to school. Staff 1 reported\nnever being asked to check Youth A’s neck while she was\nsleeping but was asked to remove cords from her room following\nthe early incident that occurred on 4/23/23. Following the first\nincident, she was required to take all cords from Youth A’s room\nand place them in a locked room. She was not required to check\nYouth A’s personal belongings and believed the second shift staff\nwould check because Youth A was always in bed when she began\nthird shift. Because Staff 1 was also working at the time of the first\nincident she gave the following report regarding that situation\nwhich occurred the night of 4/23/23. Youth A was upset after\nbeing told “no” by a supervisor and went into her room. Staff 1\ngave her a few minutes of alone time before knocking on the door\nand requesting to enter. Youth A informed her through the door\nthat she was changing and after hearing a nose, Staff 1 went into\nthe room to find Youth A laying on the floor face down. Staff 1\nasked Youth A if she needed anything and Youth A did not\nrespond. Youth A’s hair was covering her neck causing Staff 1 not\nto observe her neck. Staff 1 heard Youth A grasping for air and\nbecause she was not sure of the reason for this grasping, she\nlocated and informed Staff 5 who came into the room and\ndiscovered the cord, quickly removing it from Youth A’s neck. Staff\n5 had called for the shift supervisor. Staff 1 found Youth A laying\non the floor around 11:30 to 11:45 pm and Staff 5 removed the\ncord around midnight. Staff 1 reported believing Youth A was\nfaking a seizure because “she does stuff like that often”. Staff 1\nalso reported the facility is aware of Youth A’s “faking seizures”\nand it has been “medically proven” that she engages in these\nbehaviors. Youth A had tied a computer cord around her neck\nresulting in her first admission to a psychiatric hospital.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n5/18/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Therapist was\nalso interviewed via phone on 6/5/23. She reported being\nassigned as Youth A’s primary therapist when Youth A was placed\nat the facility. She also reported following the first incident on\n4/23/23, a safety plan was developed when Youth A returned to\nthe facility on 5/1/23 that included the following conditions. Staff\nare to review Youth A’s goals twice a day and debrief with Youth A\nhow she will accomplish the goals at the beginning of the day and\nwhat progress she made just before bedtime. Staff were to\nconduct five-minute bedroom checks and always keep within\narm’s length of Youth A apart from her using the bathroom. Staff\nare also to report to the clinical team if they notice any changes in\nYouth A’s moods. She did admit there was nothing in the safety\n4",
    "plan about checking Youth A’s neck when doing room checks.\nYouth A was stepped down on 5/12/23 from the 5-minute checks\nto 10-minute checks because she had presented with stable\nbehaviors/emotions for approximately 2 weeks. Therapist made\nthis decision after speaking with staff and reviewing written\ndocumentation of Youth A’s behaviors. Therapist’s supervisor (no\nlonger with the facility) also provided feedback to her about this\ndecision. Once stepped down, Youth A was allowed to have\ndifferent items in her room and staff no longer removed items from\nher room. Therapist reported they are developing a safety plan for\nschool and will not allow communication between Youth A and her\ngrandparents and sister because of the stress it places on Youth\nA. When Youth A returns to the facility, she will be placed back on\nfive-minute checks and have daily searches of her room and\nbackpack. Every Thursday there is a team meeting to discuss\nyouth and all direct staff are required to attend so they are\ninformed of the safety issues and progress or lack of progress with\nYouth A. Youth A has been receiving Dialectical Behavior Therapy\n(DBT) and Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\n(TFCBT) and will continue to do so upon her return to the facility.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n5/18/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nbeing present the morning (5/15/23) Youth A reported to have\nslept with a cord around her neck all night. She also reported not\nbeing aware of the situation until Therapist told her later in the\nday. She took Youth A to school that morning but did not notice\nany bruising on her neck or other parts of her body. She reported\nYouth A was wearing a navy-blue hoodie with strings which\ncovered her neck area. She also reported checking with Youth A\nabout her goals for the day as outlined in the safety plan for Youth\nA. She described her interactions with Youth A and Staff 1 when\nattempting to wake up Youth A that morning. Youth A was still\nasleep when Staff 2 returned from escorting another youth to\nschool, so Staff 2 went into Youth A’s bedroom and asked her to\nget up before making loud noises to wake her. Staff 2 reported\nYouth A was breathing as evidenced by her stomach moving up\nand down. Youth A was sleeping in her hoodie and Staff 2 did not\nnotice anything unusual. Around 7:20am Youth A woke up, ate\nbreakfast and was taken to school by Staff 2. Staff 2 found nothing\nunusual or worrying about Youth A during the morning and trip to\nschool. Staff 2 also reported never being told to check Youth A’s\nneck when doing a room check. When she completed room\nchecks she would check to make sure Youth A was breathing and\nshe reported Youth A got her personal items back after the five-\nminute check was lifted.\n5",

He reported\nnot knowing why he was being interviewed but does know and\nworks with Youth A. He heard that she had wrapped a cord\naround her neck but has no details about the incident. He worked\nsecond shift the day (5/14/23) before the report at school and\nbelieves she was acting fine with no issues during the shift. He\nreported not knowing if any staff checked her belongings prior to\ngoing to bed or if staff had debriefed with her that evening. He\nalso reported when doing room checks he will go into the room to\nverify the youth is breathing but will not move blankets or check\nunder them because of privacy for the youth. He does not recall\nbeing instructed to check Youth A’s neck area. He reported\nnothing unusual occurred so he had nothing to report to the next\nshift but if something had happened, he would have reported it as\nrequired. He also reported conducting variable room checks of five\nor ten minutes which ever was required at the time.\nComplainant was interviewed via phone, on 5/23/2023. She\nreported being the hospital social worker who delt with Youth A\nwhen she was brought to the hospital.

The next day she was one of\nthe staff who picked up Youth A from the school on 5/14/23 at 9-\n9:30 am and transported her and Therapist to the hospital. During\nthe ride to the hospital, Staff 4 asked Youth A if she wanted to talk\nand Youth A told her she became triggered after speaking to her\ngrandfather and sister after Staff 4 had left the unit for the\nevening. Youth A informed Staff 4, she had taken her computer\npower cord and wrapped it around her neck and slept that way the\nrest of the night. Staff 4 reported observing bruising/marks on\nYouth A’s neck on the way to the hospital. Staff 4 also reported\nstaff are required to monitor youth’s emotions and behaviors\n6",
    "throughout the day and then record how the youth’s day went at\nthe end of the shift. Staff should log if the youth has taken their\nmedication. When Staff 4 engages in room checks she reported\nshe will complete the checks between five and ten minutes apart\nand at variable times. She checks for breathing and now she has\nbeen instructed to make sure Youth A is not wearing a sweatshirt.\nStaff 4 also reported she will ask Youth A to show her neck and\nhave her pull down her blanket if it is over her neck. Staff 4\nreported the training staff went over the first situation to help her\nunderstand the extra level of supervision Youth A requires. Staff 4\nreported being told by Youth A, that Youth A went to her room\nprior to 9:00pm on 5/14/23. Staff 4 shared a belief that youth are\nnot supposed to engage in bedtime to the scheduled bedtime at\n9:30pm. She believes staff are checking on Youth A as required.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone, on 5/24/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker.

Staff 1 called him into Youth A’s bedroom saying Youth A\nhad a cord wrapped around her neck. Staff 5 entered the room\nand found Youth A laying on the floor gasping for air. He removed\nthe cord from her neck and reported it was a computer cord. He\ncalled the supervisor on campus and the on-call supervisors. He\nalso reported removing all items that could be used for self-harm\nwhen she returned from the hospital (5/1/23) following the first\nincident on 4/23/23. He described the precautions required for\nYouth A as other staff described and reported Youth A was\nremoved from some of the precautions a few days before the\nsecond incident. He believed Youth A had been doing much better\nuntil she got her belongings back and did the same thing again a\nfew days later.

He was informed she had gone to bed and was\nsleeping. He did not go to her room to check on her. He also\nreported she never spoke about her relatives or appeared upset\nwhen he had interactions with her during the day. He left campus\nat 10:00pm and the incident at the road took place around 3-4:00\npm. He reported checking on staff to ensure they are following the\nrequirements of the precautions and in supervision meetings will\nreview the video recording to ensure they are completing checks\nappropriately. He admitted to not checking the video on that\nSunday but stated he is watching the videos when he works since\nthe incident. He reported youth are allowed to go to bed if feeling\ntired, so he had no concerns Youth A was in bed when he stopped\nby the house. He reported team meeting takes place weekly and\neach youth is discussed with all staff required to attend in person\nor on Teams.\nYouth A was interviewed via phone, on 6/1/2023. She is\ncurrently in the hospital awaiting the results of a psychological\nevaluation for placement. She reported going back to the facility\n8",

She reported staff\nwere checking on her every 5-minutes and she was always under\nsupervision. She also reported remembering the first incident that\noccurred on 4/23/23 but cannot recall why she tired the cord\naround her neck.

All the actions taken are to be documented\nin the observation log. He also reported checking Youth A’s\nbackpack, bedroom, and bathroom daily for items she could use\nfor self-harm. He was unable to recall the level of supervision (5 or\n10 minutes) when the incident on 5/15/23 was to have occurred.\nSchool Staff was interviewed via phone, on 6/9/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported school staff\nobserved bruising on Youth A’s neck at school on 5/15/2023.\nYouth A informed the school nurse she had tried to harm herself\nwith something tied either a rope or computer cord around her\nneck. Youth A gave no specific information and never said why\nshe took this self-harming action, but she never told anyone at the\nfacility what she had done. The facility came to the school to pick\nher up right away after being notified by the school. School Staff\nalso reported there is a safety plan in place for Youth A when she\nis at school. This is the same safety plan provided by the facility.\nYouth A had a history of leaving class often, so she was to check\nin with the school social worker before leaving.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nCase history: In review of Youth A’s case file the following\ninformation was documented. Youth A was admitted to the facility\non 11/21/22, Youth A first tied a cord around her neck on 4/23/23\nand was hospitalized on 4/23/23. Youth A returned to the facility\n9",
    "on 5/1/23 and placed on restrictive precautions and a safety plan.\nThe restrictive precautions were reduced on 5/12/23 and Youth A\nreported she tied another cord around her neck the evening of\n5/14/23 when she went to school the morning of 5/15/23. Youth A\nwas re-hospitalized on 5/15/23 and released back to the facility on\n5/24/23 at which time restrictive precautions and the safety plan\nwere reinstated. Youth A was allowed to return to school on\n5/25/23 (slight reduction in precautions). Youth A went AWOL\nfrom school on 5/31/23 and hospitalized for the third time the\nsame day. Youth A was discharge from the facility on 6/1/23.\nResidential Initial Service Plan dated 12/22/22 developed for\nYouth A. There is a documented history of self-harming behaviors\nand suicidal ideation resulting in hospitalization at different times\nin her life. Youth A’s fainting was diagnosed as behavioral in\nnature and non-epileptic. Numerous triggers regarding her self-\nharming behaviors are listed as are her warning signs of the\nbeginning of her dysregulation. The two pseudo seizures and\nfainting spelling she displayed during this reporting period are\ndocumented and she received medical attention. It is also\ndocumented she engaged in two separate self-harming episodes\nin which her attempts resulted in superficial cutting. Youth A\nreported she was trying to release her frustration. Youth A is\nreceiving twice weekly individual and/or group therapy, medical,\ndental services, and psychiatric medication. The goals identified in\nthis report are in response to the presenting problems. These\ngoals include, managing anxiety and depression, improving family\nrelationships, daily attendance at school, and development of\nindependent living skills.\nUpdated Residential Initial Service Plan dated 3/21/23\ndeveloped for Youth A. This document outlines Youth A’s\nprogress in the treatment program from 12/22/22 to 3/21/23.\nDocumentation indicates, Youth A is struggling to follow through\nwith her therapy homework and guidance from staff. She tends to\nseek a significant amount of attention and expressed suicidal\nideation with no plan. Youth A did engage in self-harming\nbehaviors on three occasions resulting in no serious injury. Youth\nA also engaged in attempted AWOL twice during this reporting\nperiod. Youth A has been visiting with her grandparents both off\ncampus and through phone calls without emotional dysregulation.\nYouth A still struggles with her school attendance and will utilize\nthe nurse’s office at school seeking medical attention.\nEmail from Foster Care Worker This email was received on\n5/19/23 and in response to the email sent by this writer. Foster\n10",
    "Care Worker stated, ‘Thank you for the update. My major concern\nis that Youth A was supposed to be checked on overnight every\n10 minutes, and if that was occurring how did she sleep the entire\nnight with a cord wrapped around her neck… also why was a cord\nin Youth A’s room at all she had done the exact same thing 2\nweeks prior to this current incident. I am concerned regarding the\nday-to-day supervision that St. John’s provides.\nClinical Assessment for increased checks dated 5/1/2023 for\nYouth A authored by Therapist. The room checks for Youth A\nwere increased to no more than every five-minutes due to her\nrecent harm to self and her history of self-harm. This document\noutlines Youth A attempted self-harm with a cord around her neck\non 4/23/23 and placed in a psychiatric hospital until 5/1/23 when\nshe was released back to the facility. The identified trigger to this\naction by Youth A is identified as a visit with her grandfather and\nyounger sister. The type of room check is documented as suicide\nrisk and self-harm risk. Actions to be taken are as follows; remove\nall items from her room that can be used for self-harm and these\nitems cannot be returned to her room until clinical approval is\ngiven. Five-minute room checks are to be completed when Youth\nA is in her room awake and sleeping. Staff are to use the\n“Precaution flowsheet” to document their interactions and room\nchecks and Youth A’s room is to be searched prior to Youth A’s\nreturn to campus. Visits with the grandfather have been\nsuspended until Youth A is emotionally stable. Youth A is allowed\nto continue normal programing if five-minute checks can be\nmaintained.\nClinical Assessment for increased checks dated 5/12/2023 for\nYouth A authored by Therapist. This document outlines room\nchecks being decreased to every ten-minutes and documenting\nYouth A’s activities/interactions/demeanor. The rationale for this\nchange is documented as Youth A does not need 1:1 supervision\nbut could benefit from increased support and monitoring because\nof recent self-harm. Youth A is no longer considered a suicide risk\nbut remains a self-harm risk. However, there is nothing indicating\nall self-risk items should be removed from her room. Visits with\nher grandfather are still suspended and she can attend\nprogramming and merit outing if the ten-minute supervision can be\nmaintained.\nPrecautions Flow Sheet dated 5/12/23 for Youth A was\nreviewed. This document outlines Youth A will have ten-minute\nroom checks and will attend school. The reason for the precaution\n11",
    "is self-harm risk and suicide risk.

Documentation indicates, room\nchecks with Youth A continued in a variable interval manner within\na 10-minute time frame.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews and written documentation, evidence does\nnot support staff did not provide for the protection and supervision\nof Youth A. There was a precaution put into place which provided\nadditional supervision; however, it is likely the facility removed the\n5-minute checks without fully understanding the intent of Youth A\nto engage in self-harming behaviors once gaining the therapist’s\ntrust.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt was recommended, the facility not remove a youth from\nprecautions until the youth has displayed a significant length of\ntime without any displays of self-harming behaviors or suicidal\nideation. A two-week period does not appear appropriate given\nthe nature of the ideation and behaviors. The direct care staff\nshould also be sought out for feedback since they have daily\ncontact and need to be the ones measuring the youth’s behaviors.\nThe decision should be a team decision with all in agreement.\nIt was recommended the facility develop precautions at the\nbeginning of a youth’s stay if they have any history of self-harm or\nsuicidal ideations.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127-4 Resident Ratio\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nDescription supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents.

The training should\ninclude documentation of the staff’s comprehension of the rule\nbefore beginning to make checks.\nIt was recommended the facility develop a very comprehensive\nover-site program to ensure youth checks are being monitored to\nensure compliance with the rule. In the beginning the over-site\nshould check all check logs and when a period of time has passed\nand the checks are doing appropriately, then random checks\nshould ensue but never stopped all together.\nIt was recommended that the facility update their supervision\npolicy to include variable interval room checks under the section of\nsupervision at bedtime and throughout the night.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews and written documentation, evidence\nsupports that staff were not engage in variable interval checks on\n17",
