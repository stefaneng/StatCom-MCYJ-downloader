Youth later reported slipping and falling with Staff 1. Youth had bruising to\none of their arms and had arm pain. On 6/5/22, youth was taken for medical care\nand was diagnosed with a broken humorous. On 6/6/22, youth reported that Staff 1\npushed them and tripped them, causing the injury.\nINVESTIGATION:\nCase Manager was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 6/6/22. He\nreported the incident with Youth A took place on Saturday 6/4/22 and involved Staff\n1. There were no eyewitnesses to the allegations except for Staff 1 who had no\ninitial report of injury to Youth A but later reported the injury took place around 12:20\npm. Case Manager became aware of the injury when informed by Staff 10, after he\nwas informed by Youth A at approximately 4:40 pm. Case Manager observed the\ninjuries and found bruising on Youth A's chest, collarbone, and left arm. Youth A told\nCase Manager, Staff 1 had hit him and pushed him into a wall. Youth A also said the\ninside of his left elbow hurt. Case Manager began treatment with ice and Tylenol\nand noticed Youth A was not using his left arm as much as in the past. The next\nmorning Case Manager checked on Youth A and found the symptoms had not\nimproved so he was taken to the hospital. Case Manager also reported speaking\nwith Staff 1 and being told Youth A was being aggressive towards him when Youth A\nslipped twice and fell to the ground, which Staff 1 believed caused the injury. He was\ntold Staff 2 was in the dining room during the incident and looked into the room\nwhere Youth A and Staff 1 were engaged in the allegations. Staff 4 was also in the\ndining room. Staff 2 informed Case Manager Staff 1 texted her about the incident\nafter their shift. Case Manager provided the contact information for staff working at\nthe time of the incident that included Nurse, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, Staff 6, Staff 7,\nStaff 8, Staff 9, and Staff 10.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 6/6/22. Youth A has\nlimited verbal skills, but he reported his arm hurt and he showed his cast on his left\narm. He also reported being pushed by Staff 1 as the reason for his hurt arm.",
    "Administrator and Case Manager were interviewed via telephone, on 6/7/22 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Both report receiving information of Youth A's\ninjuries at 4:40 pm the day it occurred but Staff 1 should have reported it when it\noccurred according to policies/procedures. Both gave the same report of how they\nwere informed of the injuries. Case Manager reported speaking to Staff 1 after 5:00\npm and writing the incident report from information provided by Staff 1. He was\nconcerned with Youth A's health and forgot to ask Staff 1 why he did not write an\nincident report. Administrator reported Youth A was taken to the hospital on Sunday\n6/5/22 and received information that Staff 2 wanted to tell her what really happened.\nCase Manager informed Staff 1 he would not be working with Youth A on Sunday\nand later informed him he was suspended during the investigation. Staff 1 would\nneed to provide an account of what occurred. They received a written report from\nStaff 1 and spoke with Staff 2 gathering information about the incident. Staff 1\ndenied any wrongdoing in his report and Staff 2 informed them; Staff 1 wanted to\nhurt Youth A. Both Staff 1 and Staff 2 admitted to being in a romantic relationship\nthat ended a couple of weeks ago when Administrator and Case Manager became\naware of the relationship. This type of relationship is not allowed by\npolicy/procedures. Staff 2 provided a copy of the text messages she was having with\nStaff 1 about the allegations. These text message begin on Saturday 6/4/22 and end\non Sunday 6/5/22. Administrator reported there are several violations of the facility's\nphone policy and HIPPA policies within the text messages. Both believe Staff 2 is\ntrying to cover up Staff 1's behaviors at the beginning of the text message but later\nquestions him. It appears upon learning about the broken bone, Staff 2 started\nsharing what she knew was the truth about the allegations. Both reported there are\ncameras in the facility, but they are not allowed to record only current view is allowed\nby Community Mental Health restrictions.\nStaff 7 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/11/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. She reported being told by Staff 1 \"weeks before\" the incident, he would\n\"put hands on\" Youth A if Youth A ever touched Staff 2 again. She was working the\nday and shift of the incident. She was supervising another youth who was on one-\non-one, and her involvement was watching the camera footage. She noticed Youth\nA was in a \"safety separation\" with Staff 1 being his primary staff at the time. The\nsafety separation was taking place in the Hearth room and Staff 7 noticed Staff 1\nwas staying in the room longer than what he should have been. Staff 7 described\nstaff's involvement and positioning when there is a safety separation with a youth.\n\"Normally staff and everyone else leave the room because they are trying to\ndeescalate the youth\". Staff 7 over heard Youth A making sounds that he normally\nmakes when becoming aggressive with someone while Staff 1 was in the room with\nYouth A. She was unsure why Staff 1 was staying in the room so long and several\ntimes, Staff 1 was asked to leave the room to help Youth A deescalate. She also\nreported that once she changed positions that day, she became the lead staff and\nStaff 1 told her he wanted to stay and work through the safe separation with Youth A\nrather than switch out with the next staff. Staff are to switch out every hour during a\nsafety separation. She told Staff 1 that staff are not to \"work through things\" with\nyouth. Staff 1 continued to \"hang around\" before she had him leave the building in",
    "such a way; he had no further contact with Youth A. Staff 7 reported Youth A told\nStaff 10 who replaced Staff 1 that he had a \"boo boo\" because Staff 1 hurt his arm\nwhen Staff 1 pushed him to the floor near a door in the room. Staff 7 informed Case\nManager and Case Manager spoke with Youth A about the allegations of Staff 1\npushing him. Staff 13 also came into the area and checked Youth A. Staff 7 reported\nknowing Staff 1 and Staff 2 were in a relationship and believes Staff 1’s response to\nYouth A maybe a result of this relationship because Youth A had touched Staff 2\nsexually. She believes Staff 1 wanted to work with Youth A but over time he did not\nwant to work with him any longer. Staff 7 reported being told by Staff 2 the night of\nthe incident that she was \"super conflicted\" knowing things about the incident that\nothers did not know. Staff 7 encouraged Staff 2 to report what she knew about the\nincident to others because she is a mandated reporter. Staff 7 never knew what\ninformation Staff 2 had until they reported this information to Case Manager the next\nday when Staff 7 accompanied her. Staff 7 texted Administrator about midnight\n(night of incident) to inform her of Staff 2 having further information.\nStaff 9 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/11/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. She reported working at the facility the day of the incident from 1:00 pm to\n10:00 pm. When she arrived at work, Youth A was in a safety separation in the\nHearth room and \"making sounds like he was aggressing towards someone\". Staff\nare to stay out of the area when a youth is in a safety separation, but she was\nunaware of who was in the room with Youth A. After lunch Staff 9 \"switched to\nmedication passing\" and Youth A told her his elbow was hurt. Throughout the shift\nStaff 9 worked, Youth A complained of pain in his elbow, so she gave him an ice\npack. Youth A would not let Staff 9 examine his arm or touch him. Staff 9 called\nCase Manager to inform him of the injury and lack of movement of Youth A's arm.\nShe was told to write an incident report and monitor Youth A. Case Manager told her\nif the pain and lack of movement grows worst within the next 24-hours, Youth A\nshould be taken to the hospital. She reported not knowing of any past issues\nbetween Staff 1 and Youth A other than Youth A disliked Staff 1.\nStaff 10 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/11/22 in collaboration with\nMDHHS worker. He reported working the day of the incident on second shift which\nbegan between 2:30 pm and 2:45 pm. He was scheduled to work with Youth A and\ntook over for Staff 1 but did not notice anything out of normal. Youth A told him his\narm hurt because Staff 1 pushed him. At first Staff 10 \"didn't think much of it\",\nbecause in the past Youth A seeks ways to get to the hospital. However, this time,\nYouth A was showing a different type of pain and Staff 10 observed a mark on his\ncollarbone. The mark turned out to be a bruise, so Staff 10 called Staff 7 and said\nshe needed to inform Case Manager right away. They observed Youth A and\nnoticed very limited arm movement and a \"rug burn\" on his chest and marks on his\nleft elbow. Staff 10 also reported Case Manager took Youth A into the bathroom for\nprivacy but failed to observe the same bruising that Staff 10 observed. Staff 10 is\nunsure why they were not seeing the same thing and he believes Case Manager\nwas \"not fully understanding what was going on\". Staff 10 believed the nurse should\nhave been called because of the medical knowledge but he is unsure if this",
    "occurred. Staff 10 denied knowing or hearing of any issues between Staff 1 and\nYouth A.\nStaff 12 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/11/22 in collaboration with\nMDHHS worker. She reported not working the day of the incident but working the\nday after and noticed Staff 1 was working that morning and offered to come back\ninto work later that night. During the second shift and the return from the hospital by\nYouth A, Staff 1 asked her about Youth A going to the hospital because \"his injury\ndidn't look that bad\". When Youth A observed Staff 1 \"Youth A began aggressing\ntowards Staff 1\" and ran up to him and started punching him. Staff 12 told him to\nleave the area. Staff 12 refused to leave Staff 1 alone with Youth A and she sent\nStaff 1 home. She reported earlier during first shift she noticed Youth A was not\nusing his left arm and told her Staff 1 had hurt him. His arm looked limp and felt cold\nto the touch. She observed his collarbone area and found bruising. She took pictures\nand called Administrator who was the \"On-call manager\" at the time. Administrator\ntold her it was reported Youth A was using his arm yesterday but should take him to\nthe hospital now. Staff 12 sent the pictures of bruising and injuries to Case Manager\nbecause he had observed the bruising yesterday. Staff 12 described Staff 1 as\nhaving a \"poor attitude towards Youth A\" and will escalate Youth A.\nStaff 11 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/11/22 in collaboration with\nMDHHS worker. He reported working the first shift the day after the incident and\nupon learning about the injuries, instructed another staff to write an incident report.\nStaff 14 was working with Youth A that morning and called Staff 11 after noticing\nbruising and a lack of movement in the left arm. Youth A was given pain medication\nand taken to the hospital later that day. He believed Staff 1 and Youth A had a\n\"decent relationship\" prior to the incident.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/12/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. She reported being present when the incident took place. She was in the\ndining room which is next door to the Hearth room where Staff 1 and Youth A were\nlocated at the time. She overheard noise and \"peeked\" her head out of the door.\nStaff 1 told her Youth A slipped on water and fell to the floor. Staff 1 also told her this\noccurred before he knew what happened. She does not remember seeing water and\njust \"took his word for it\". She also reported, Staff 1 never said there was not water\non the floor, but she believed \"it was clear there was no water\" after speaking to him\nlater that day. She also believes Staff 1 should have left Youth A in the room alone\nbecause he was in a safety separation and would only escalate. She told Staff 4\nabout Staff 1 staying in the room and Staff 4 also looked out of the dining room door\nabout three times. She texted Staff 1 to ask what was going on and Staff 1 replied\nhe will tell her later tonight. She also reported being informed by Staff 1 of what\noccurred in text messages (a review of these text messages is below) and speaking\nto him that evening. Staff 1 informed her he got annoyed with Youth A because of\nhis behaviors such as touching others faces. Youth A began to hit him, and every\ntime Youth A tried to kick him, Staff 1 would move his foot under Youth A's foot\ncausing him to fall, landing on his left arm (this is the arm he broke). Staff 1 told Staff",
    "2 he lost count of the number of times Youth A fell to the ground and grew tired of\nthis because Youth A continued to get up. Staff 1 then reported to Staff 2, he put an\narm guard on and was able to grab Youth A by his shoulder while flexing his\ncollarbone. He was able to get his fingers under Youth A's collarbone and began\npulling him around and pushing him by the collarbone. Staff 1 said he \"wanted to\nmake Youth A's last days at the center a living hell and he wanted to kill him\". Staff 2\nwas unsure how serious Staff 1 was with these statements. Staff 1 also told her he\ncould have done more and wanted to see the safety separation all the way through.\nHe ended by telling her he did this for her. Staff 2 reported a belief Staff 1 was trying\nto protect her because they were in a relationship and Youth A had become sexually\naggressive with her. Youth A was targeting her and would try to rip off her clothes or\ntouch her breasts or genital area. She was able to speak to her supervisor and\nrestrictions were put into place which stopped her having contact with Youth A. She\nbelieves, Staff 1 did not see her receiving any support and took matters into his own\nhands. Staff 2 also reported she supported Staff 1 until he shared information about\nwhat occurred the evening of the incident and her view changed. Staff 2 reported\nspeaking to Case Manager after Youth A went to the hospital and wrote an incident\nreport. She believed Case Manager was downplaying the injury because he was\nfriends with Staff 1 prior to his promotion.\nStaff 14 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/15/22 in collaboration with\nMDHHS worker. He reported not working the day of the incident but working first\nshift the next day. He noticed a difference in Youth A immediately because Youth A\nwas not targeting others and when aggressing he was not using his left arm. Youth\nA told him he needs to go to the doctor because his left arm is hurting. The lead staff\n(Staff 15) was informed along with the on-call manager. Staff 15 called upper\nmanagement and Staff 14 was told to monitor Youth A. This took place around 9:00\nAM. When Youth A took off his shirt for a shower, Staff 14 noticed significant\nbruising on his shoulder and around the collarbone area. Staff 14 described the\nbruising as \"not normal\". Staff 11 was present and observed the significant bruising\nand both staff showed the bruising to Staff 15. Staff 14 asked other staff who worked\nthe day before if they knew anything about the situation and Staff 1 said he was the\nstaff on duty during the safety separation with Youth A. Staff 1 told him, Youth A\nslipped twice and fell to the floor while trying to kick Staff 1. Staff 14 also reported\n\"accepting Staff 1 statements about what occurred but he still questioned the\nsignificant bruising on the collarbone area. Staff did what they could to help Youth A\nwith the pain and later that day at approximately 9:00 PM, Staff 14 called back to get\nan update on Youth A and was told he was at the hospital. Staff 14 reported staff\nshould only enter a room a youth in a safety separation is in for compliance checks\nand when the youth is no longer escalated.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/15/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. He reported working the day of the incident and with Youth A specifically\nfrom 7:00 to 12:00 that morning. He then switched to work with another youth and\nreported staff only work with Youth A for a 4-hour period because of his aggression.\nStaff 6 was in a \"back office\" and did not observe what was occurring with Youth A",
    "when Staff 1 was with him. He also reported working the next day but having no\ninformation about what occurred. He only heard rumors of Youth A's arm being\nbroken.\nStaff 8 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/15/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. She reported working as a cook on the day of the incident but has no\nfirsthand knowledge of what occurred. She also reported not hearing any noise from\nHearth room which is next to the dining room.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/15/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. She reported working the day of the incident and the next day. She also\nreported having no knowledge of what occurred and never observed anything\ninappropriate.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/15/22 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. He reported working the day of the incident and having some interaction\nwith Staff 1. He was in the dining room and several times looked through the doors\nleading to the Hearth room. He told Staff 1, who was staying in the environment\nlonger than necessary to leave but having Staff 1 not leave for several minutes later.\nThis occurred several times with no reason for Staff 1 to stay in the environment \"a\nsecond longer than he was\". He never observed water on the floor and never\nobserved Staff 1 do anything inappropriate. He did hear Youth A making aggressive\nnoises repeatedly. Staff 4 also reported staff are to stay out of the environment\nduring a safety separation unless the situation becomes unsafe for the youth.\nStaff 15 was interviewed via telephone, on 7/15/22 in collaboration with\nMDHHS worker. He reported working the day after the incident occurred. He\nobserved Youth A and found him to not be using his left arm and complaining of\npain.

He reported working the day of the incident but at 8:00 PM. He\nwas given information from Staff 7 and Staff 9 about Youth A's injuries, and both\nasked him to observe these injuries on Youth A. Staff 13 also reported not being a\nmedical expert, but he did check Youth A. He described the bruising in the\ncollarbone area as being caused by deep broken blood vessels and possible\nbruising of the collarbone. He did not observe any evidence of a broken bone in\nYouth A's arm, but he informed them Youth A should be taken to the hospital to be\nchecked out by a doctor. Staff 13 reported any staff can \"make the call\" to take a\nyouth to the hospital if they suspect an injury that needs immediate medical\nattention. He was not sure if Staff 7 and Staff 9 had the medical training that most\nlead staff had because of the rate of staff turn over the facility has experienced\nlately. Staff 13 also reported Youth A told him Staff 1 pushed him. When talking with",
    "Staff 6 regarding reporting Staff 1's behavior, Staff 6 state, \"how can you do that to\nanother employee\".\nSeveral attempts were made to interview Staff 1, but these attempts were\nunsuccessful.\nMDHHS worker reported the individual was deemed unsuitable.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nPictures of Youth A without a date but received on 7/11/22.

The plan also provides in\ndetail staff's actions to be taken in both setting.\nResidential Opportunities Inc. Best Practice: Medical Situations Training and\nChecklist dated 8/2017. Emergency care is defined as an injury or illness that\nposes an immediate risk to a youth's life or long-term health. Staff are to call 911 or\nif safe transport youth to the closest Emergency Room. Urgent care is defined as not\nmeeting the emergency delimitation but requiring \"quick action or attention\" that\ncannot wait for a scheduled appointment.

This\ndocument outlines the techniques staff are to use to quickly change a youth's\ndirections of movement when they are headed towards something unsafe. This\ntechnique is to be used if a youth is being aggressive and does not involve yanking,\npushing, or grabbing the youth. De-Escalation techniques involve three different\naspects, help, prompt, and wait. The help technique is to be used when the youth is\nshowing signs of aggression and involves giving the youth acceptable choices. The\nprompt technique involves providing the desire behavior in a calm neutral tone and\nallow 5-10 seconds for the youth to respond. The wait technique involves removing\nothers near the situation, using a safety stance which is placing yourself in a position\nto monitor the youth while maintaining safety, and avoid reinforcing the negative\nbehaviors. Avoid eye contact and responding in a provocative manner. Other\naspects of the de-escalation process are to involve not rushing the youth and being\naware of the staff's own emotional behavior.\nIncident, Accident, Illness, Death, or Fire Report for Youth A dated 6/4/22.
