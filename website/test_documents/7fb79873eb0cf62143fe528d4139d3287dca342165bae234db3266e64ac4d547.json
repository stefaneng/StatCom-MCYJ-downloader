EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. Special evaluation 2024SEC0001901 was initiated on 9/12/2024 regarding\nallegations a licensed foster parent slapped two foster youth in the face and pulled\nthem out of their room by their ears.

The agency was cited for 15 violations, 3 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 3, there was an improvement in individual incidents of\nnon-compliance within all 3 of the violation areas. In 2023, 16 violations were\nestablished, 6 of which were repeated this year. All the repeated violations remain\nclose to the same number of individual incidents of non-compliances. The agency\nwill need to establish additional corrective planning for the repeated violations to\nensure a reduction of incidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed.
