Physical Description of Facility\nThe House of Providence is located in Oxford Township, Michigan. The House of\nProvidence Girls facility is a new construction comprised of approximately 22 acres. It is a\nranch style home with a basement. The basement is used for storage. The parking area is\nlocated on the west side of the facility. Primary access for the residents and staff is through\na side entrance door. Primary access for visitors is through the front entrance door. Upon\nentering the front entrance, there is a kitchen, pantry and a dining room area. Off of the\ndining room is a covered patio. The office area and one bathroom is located on the left side\nof the kitchen. Medications are kept double-locked in a medication room in the office area.\nA door, which can be locked, separates the office area and kitchen. The sleeping area for\nthe residents is located on the right side of the facility. There are five bedrooms each\ncontaining two single beds, two dressers, a window and a closet. The residents’ bathroom is\nnext to the sleeping area. It contains five partitioned toilets, five partitioned shower stalls\nand three sinks. The laundry room and sitting/entertainment area is located on the same\nside as the sleeping area. All beds and furniture are new. The facility has been\nprofessionally decorated with earthy colors and furnishings.\nMDHHS, Division of Environment Health (DEH), Toxicology and Response Section (TARS)\ncompleted a Letter Health Consultation (LHC). The LHC concluded that there is no\napparent public health hazard that would present a health risk to most future full-time\nresidents of the house built on 3791 Barber Road (parcel two), which is to be used as a\nChild Caring Institution (CCI). Recommendations for use of a protective barrier on adjacent\nparcels of land owned by the licensees were made and have been installed in the form of\nsnow fencing in the designated areas. Additional recommendations were made regarding\nadmission criteria for future residents and supervision of those residents, addressed later in\nthis report.\nB. Program Description\nThe House of Providence Girls program was previously operated in Detroit, Michigan.\nThe policies and procedures essentially remain the same as the previous program, with\nrevisions made based on the recommendations from the LHC regarding admission\ncriteria for residents and supervision while residents are outside on the property.\nThe House of Providence Girls program is a non-secured residential treatment program\nservicing a maximum of six female residents between the ages of seven and seventeen\nyears, who are abuse and neglect wards (temporary or permanent). The facility will\naccept residents with general to moderate care requirements to include emotional and\nbehavioral issues with a range of cognitive level of functioning. House of Providence will\nthoroughly examine residents’ medical records and will refrain from accepting youth\n3",
    "who have a diagnosis of PICA and those who have hyperparathyroidism. Further, they\nwill refrain from accepting youth who have a known elevated blood lead level.\nResident’s first choice of school will be through the Oxford Public Schools. The facility\nwill also use an accredited online charter school through Oxford Public Schools Virtual\nAcademy on a secondary basis. The virtual charter school will only be implemented\nwhen a Family Team Meeting concludes that is the best option for the specific resident\nand in compliance with DHHS policy. Tutoring will be available at the House of\nProvidence Girls. Services for the program will include but are not limited to individual\nand group therapy, a variety of recreational activities, both on-grounds and off-grounds,\nand social work services.\nThe facility will have a staff to resident ratio of one staff to four residents during wake\nhours and one awake staff for every six residents during sleeping hours. Meals will be\nprepared by staff. Staff has been certified in first aid and CPR. The facility will also\nutilize Crisis Prevention Intervention as their behavior management system to include\nproper and safe techniques of restraints. The facility will use local physicians and\ndentists, as well as other specialists as deemed necessary.\nPer the recommendation of the LHC, the following policies and procedures to minimize\nlead exposure were developed:\n No House of Providence Girls residents will play, hike, walk, etc., to any other\nparcel, other than the parcel that the licensed CCI is situated on. Staff will\nsupervise residents at all times when residents are outside of the home and will\nredirect residents back inside if they go outside without permission. One to one\nsupervision staff to resident supervision will be utilized when needed.\n Properties will be properly maintained and will be appropriately covered with non-\nedible ground covering, as much as is possible.\n Hand washing will continue to be a priority and a requirement for staff and\nresidents. Regular and weekly home cleaning will continue. This includes\ndusting, vacuuming (HEPA filter system) and floor sanitation with the industrial\nstrength floor cleaning machine. The cleaning will continue to be done by staff\nand any assistance that is given by residents will be minimal (less than staff’s\nresponsibilities) and given strict oversight.\n In order to minimize tracking of dirt and dust, they will continue with their “no\nshoes in the home” policy. Separate shoes will be kept for indoors and outdoors.\nDoormats and welcome mats will also be utilized to clean shoes’ surface prior to\nentering the home.\n They will not garden on the campus in Oxford for anything edible or that will be\nfor human consumption. Flower gardens are permitted. Any fruit bearing trees\nwill have the fruit washed thoroughly before consumption.\n All walking paths on the property will be properly scraped prior to usage.\n Any livestock will only be permitted on areas of the property where all lead levels\nare below required testing.\n If a play structure is planned, the agency will seek DCWL approval prior to\nbuilding and placing such a structure.\n4",
    "Facility policies and procedures have been reviewed and have been found to be in\ncompliance with State of Michigan licensing rules and applicable statutes.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThere are no violations.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that this child caring institution be issued an original license.\nJune 21, 2019\n________________________________________\nAlicia Wiggins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 21, 2019\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
