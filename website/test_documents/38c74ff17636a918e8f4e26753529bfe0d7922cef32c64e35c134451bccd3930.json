This is the agency's second incident of a youth getting a\nbroken finger.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI reviewed the complaint allegation on 8/17/2020 and spoke with Consultant 2 on\n8/18/2020. This matter initially came to the department’s attention due to Resident A\nbeing at Hurley hospital with a broken finger and her parent’s refusal to give surgical\nconsent. Consultant 2 informed me that the agency emailed her about Resident A’s\n2",
    "injury. The agency reported Resident A was placing a water bottle in the doorframe\nhinge to prevent the door from closing and the door shut on her thumb. Additionally,\nthat Resident A reported staff was not involved in shutting the door.\nOn 8/18/2020 I spoke with Resident A’s Department of Health and Human Services\nFoster Care Worker (DHHS-FCW). She was aware of the incident. The agency\ncontacted her on Saturday (8/15/2020). The agency informed her Resident A was\ndestroying her room and got her finger caught in the door when she tried to close it.\nThe DHHS-FCW could not recall if a water bottle were mentioned. The DHHS-FCW\ncalled the facility to speak with Resident A. Resident A refused to speak with her.\nThe DHHS-FCW reported Resident A has many emotional issues and her\nbehavioral outbursts are not unusual. She reported getting numerous incident\nreports on Resident A and 99% of them are due to physical aggression by Resident\nA (i.e. kicking or assaulting staff, her twin sister, and other residents). She said,\nResident A has been at the facility since about 10/23/2019. The agency has now,\nrequested Resident A’s removal; and a targeted 30-day replacement date is\npending.\nOn 8/20/2020, during an on-site visit, I spoke with Administrator 0. She reported\nResident A has a broken thumb. Resident A was seen a Hurley hospital the day of\nthe incident on 8/15/2020. Resident needs surgery on her thumb and has a medical\nfollow up on 8/31/2020. Administrator 0 reported there was no video footage of the\nincident due to the angle of the camera.\nOn 8/20/2020 during an on-site visit I interviewed Staff 1. Staff 1 was thought to\nhave information about the incident. Staff 1 is a Vemco unit staff. She was not\npresent at the time of the incident but was present when Resident A returned from\nthe hospital. Resident A told her what happened. Resident A reported she was\ntrying to squirt Staff 3 with water. Resident A said she had put a water bottle in the\ndoor, slammed the door and it slammed her hand. Resident A thought the water\nwould push out the bottle. Resident A did not say why Resident A wanted to do that\nto Staff 3. Staff 1 speculated Resident A’s actions were due to Resident A being\nmad at Staff 3. Staff 1 advised that Resident A has a habit of coming out of her\nroom early in the morning without permission and Staff 3 has explained to Resident\nA, she (Resident A) can’t just do that. Staff 1 reported Resident A is always\nslamming her door when she gets upset. A couple of weeks ago Resident A broke\nher door by slamming it. She also broke her door when she was on the McDonald\nunit. Staff 1 reported Resident A regularly tries to attack her peers when she\n(Resident A) is upset. Resident A will apologize, only to return to the same behavior.\nResident A was moved from one unit to another due her misbehavior. Staff have\nconstantly spoken with Resident A about her behavior and the door slamming.\nOn 8/20/2020 I interviewed Staff 2 on-site. Staff 2 affirmed information in her incident\nreport as outline later in this report. Staff 2 reported her shift, which was on the\nJohnson unit, not Resident A’s unit, ended at 8:00am. Staff 2 said, Resident A was\nout of her room (before 8:00am/ before medication time, which is between 8:00am-\n3",
    "8:30am) and going back and forth between the Vemco unit and the Johnson unit.\nStaff 2 said since Staff 3 was the only staff on Vemco, Staff 3 couldn’t shadow\nResident A. Staff 2 said she was able to keep an eye on Resident A. She said, the\nincident happened after she got Resident A back on the Vemco unit, but she was not\npresent went it happened. Staff 2 was in the laundry/storage room getting a DVD\nplayer for Resident 2. Staff 2 heard Resident A scream that her finger was broken.\nWhen Staff 2 arrived back to the area, Staff 3 and Resident A were at Resident A’s\ndoor. Blood was on the floor and Staff 3 was wrapping Resident A’s finger to stop\nthe bleeding. Staff 2 took Resident A to the medical staff (not a nurse) and called\nher unit manager.\nStaff 2 said, she took Resident A to Hurley hospital because there was no one else\nwho could take Resident A. The second Vemco staff had not arrived prior to Staff\n2’s departure for the hospital. Another staff relieved Staff 2 at the hospital at\n10:30am. Staff 2 said, the hospital took x-rays of Resident A’s hand. The hospital\nadvised Resident A needed to see the hand specialist due to Resident A’s finger\nbeing fractured. Staff 2 said Resident A told her how the injury happened. Resident\nA reported she (Resident A) was trying to throw a water bottle at Staff 3, and\nResident A’s hand got caught in the door. Resident A was throwing the bottle at Staff\n3 because Staff 3 “was pissing her off”. Resident A gave no explanation of what that\nmeant. Staff 2 advised that Resident A has anger outbursts; and Resident A can go\nfrom 0-10 then back in a second. She reported the staff are working to finding\nResident A’s triggers, but that’s difficult because Resident A’s triggers are constantly\nchanging.\nOn 8/20/2020 I interviewed Resident A on-site. Resident A reported she smashed\nher hand in her bedroom door. She was trying to put a water bottle in the door so it\nwould squeeze out on Staff 3, but her hand got stuck and the door closed on her\nfinger. She reported, when she was holding the bottle in the door her thumb was up\nnear the mouth of the water bottle and she was pushing the door when Staff 3\npushed it closed. The door caught her thumb. Resident A reported, doing what she\ndid with the water bottle because she was upset with Staff 3. Staff 3 “was being petty\nand rude about something” (Resident A could not recall what that something was)\nshe asked permission to do; and Staff 3 wouldn’t allow it. Resident A said, “What\nhappened to my finger had nothing to do with staff hurting me.” She did not know\nwhat other staff worked with Staff 3. She said no other resident witnessed what\nhappened. She did not report who took her to the hospital, but said she had\nsurgery and got stitches at the hospital.\nOn 8/20/2020 I interviewed Staff 3 on-site. Staff 3 reported her/the shift was 6:00am-\n2:00pm. She was the only staff on the shift. She said she was waiting for her co-\nworker who never showed. She reported sometime prior to Resident A’s injury,\nResident A asked to leave her room to go to the bathroom. Resident A went to the\nbathroom, returned to her room, but came out again. Resident A said she was out\nof her room throwing away trash. Staff 3 instructed Resident A to return to her\nbedroom, but Resident A did not. Resident A walked off the unit. Staff 3 said, she\n4",
    "couldn’t shadow behind Resident A because she (Staff 3) was the only staff on the\nunit. Seven minutes later Resident A was returned to the unit by Staff 4. Staff 3\nsaw Staff 4 return Resident A into the unit, but Staff 3 did not talk with them about\nthat incident. Resident A was to sit on the bench near the unit entrance, she did so,\nbut got up. Resident A proceeded to her room but came out again. Staff 3\ninstructed Resident A to go back to her room, and Resident A asked why she (Staff\n3) “have to be so petty”. Resident A didn’t go to her room. Resident A proceeded\ntoward the kitchen and picked up a soap bottle and threw it across the room.\nResident A appeared to be going toward a cubby that contained objects. Since\nResident A was showing signs of aggression Staff 3 said she followed policy, which\nrequires that she remove potential harmful items from near Resident A and Resident\nA’s room. Staff 3 removed the soap bottle, two journals and a pencil and secured the\nitems. Resident A got mad about that and walked off the unit again. This time Staff\n2 brought Resident A back to the unit. Staff 2 assisted her (Staff 3). Resident A\npicked up Staff 3’s phone from a desk and threw it. Staff 2 went towards Resident A\nand Resident A swung on Staff 2. Staff 3 intervened and she and Staff 2 each held\none of Resident A’s arms. Resident A was cursing and trying to hit either of them.\nThen, Resident B came out his room and asked for his DVD player. Resident B was\ngetting upset that he couldn’t get it and Staff 2 agreed to go get it.\nStaff 3 said she was standing with Resident A and Resident B who were both calm.\nHowever, Resident A got upset and Resident A dug her nails into Staff 3’s wrist.\nStaff 3 did not restrain Resident A. Staff 3 transported Resident A to Resident A’s\nroom by carrying Resident A. Staff 3 said she knew it wasn’t right, but she made the\n“executive decision” to do what she did because he had been there almost all\nmorning going back and forth trying to get Resident A to go to her room. She said,\n“I grabbed her under her shoulders and lifted her off the floor” and transported her to\nthe room. Resident A allowed her to do so; and didn’t get mad until she got Resident\nA into her room. Resident A then threw Resident A’s birthday stuff out the room.\nResident A also took an Aquafina water bottle and put it in her door and swung the\nopen. The water bottle was in the door, so Resident A tried to throw the bottle at her\nand the door swung closed. Staff 3 said her hand was never on Resident A’s door.\nShe was never pushing the door closed while Resident A was pushing it open. She\nsaid the doors are heavy and they close on their own after opening and letting them\ngo.\nStaff 3 said, she didn’t know Resident A was injured until Resident A yelled and she\nwent to see what was wrong. Resident A was crying and accusing staff, saying,\n“look what the fuck you did”. Resident A’s finger was bleeding. Resident 3 reported\nthat Staff 2 returned soon thereafter and agreed to take Resident A to the nurse.\nStaff 3 reported prior to the incident she and Resident A had a good relationship.\nShe said Resident A loves her.\nReviewed:\nStaff 2’s handwritten incident report dated 8/15/2020 that indicated the incident time\nas 8:00 am. It further indicated:\n5",
    " Resident A had walked out of the unit and was running between units. Staff\ntold Resident A to head back to the unit and waited for Resident A to go back\ninto the Vemco unit.\n Staff 2 went into the Vemco unit and Resident A started to throw stuff at both\nshe and Staff 3. Resident A was cursing and calling them names. Resident A\nrefused to walk and lay on the floor. Staff held her arms to keep her from\nhitting and running.\n Staff 2 went to get keys. Staff 3 transported Resident A to her room and Staff\n2 opened Resident A’s door. Staff 3 said she would sit in front of the door in\nan attempt to prevent Resident A from running.\n Staff 2 went to get a DVD player for another peer. While doing so Staff 2\nheard Resident A yell her finger was broke and there was blood. Staff 2 took\nResident A to the medical office where the am medical staff looked at\nResident A’s right hand. The medical staff advised Resident A needed to go\nthe hospital. Staff 2 immediately transported Resident A to Hurley hospital.\nStaff 3 handwritten incident report dated 815/2020 for an incident time of 7:20am,\nwhich indicated information basically as reported by Staff 3 when interviewed.\nHurley Hospital After Visit Summary for Resident A for 8/15/2020-8-16/2020 that the\nindicated:\n She was seen for laceration of right thumb with complication for open wound\nof the finger with complications.\n She had a surgical incision.\n She was to follow up with the general surgery in two weeks.\nFile documentation for Resident A that indicated:\n She was placed at Whaley Children’s Center on 10/25/2019. She has a twin\nsister who is also placed at the facility.\n She is a temporary court ward.\n She is diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. She has a history\nof verbal and physical aggression toward peers and staff. She requires multiple\nredirections.\n She receives individual and group therapy to assist her with anger and\ninterpersonal interactions.\nA favorable February 2020 performance evaluations for Staff 3, which indicated:\nher strongest area was child interaction and relationship building. Additionally, that she\nadvocates for residents and makes them her priority. She was encouraged to be mindful\nof her tone with residents in all situation.\nNo disciplinary actions were reported documented for Staff 3.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(a) Any type of corporal punishment inflicted in any\nmanner.\nANALYSIS: The findings do not support that a staff slammed Resident A’s\nhand/finger in the resident’s bedroom door, or that severe\ndiscipline was rendered.\nResident A tried to pull a prank on Staff 3. Resident A tried to\nforce her bedroom door onto a water filled water bottle in an\nattempt to have the water squirt out on Staff 3. Resident A\nthumb got smashed in the progress of the door closing, causing\nthe injury to her thumb.\nTechnical assistance\nI spoke with Administrator 0 regarding safety planning pertaining\nto the bedroom doors. The agency developed a safety plan\nwhich indicated they would place slow hinges on all residents’\ndoors. The hinges will enable the doors to close slowly.\nOn 9/16/2020 the agency reported, and Consultant 2 observed\nthat door swing arms/hinges were placed on the residents’\nbedroom doors in two of the facility’s three units. The third unit\nwas under renovation and had no residents.\nCONCLUSION VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff on duty to perform the prescribed functions\nrequired by these administrative rules and in the agency's\nprogram statement and to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: The evidence does not support that Resident A’s injury was\ncaused a result of a lack of protection and supervision.\nHowever, the facility was out of staff- to- resident ratio, as\nreported in the additional findings section of this report.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS\nDuring the investigation it was discovered the facility did not comply with their staff-\nto-resident- ratio; and the staff did not use appropriate physical management to\ntransport the resident.\nINVESTIGATION\nStaff 2 and Staff 3 reported Staff 3 was alone on Vemco unit for the shift. Staff 2 said\nStaff 3 was trying to get in touch with management to find out who was assigned to\nwork the shift with Staff 3. Staff 2 said since Staff 3 was the only staff on the Vemco\nunit, Staff 3 couldn’t shadow Resident A when Resident A left the unit. Staff 2 was\nfrom the Johnson unit; she kept an eye on Resident A. After the incident with\nResident A, Staff 2 stayed over to assist Staff 3. Staff 2 reported when she took\nResident A to the hospital, the second staff had not arrived. Staff 2 reported she was\nrelieved by another staff at the hospital at 10:30am.\nStaff 3 reported her/the shift was 6:00am- 2:00pm. She said there was supposed to\nbe another staff working with her and she was waiting for that co-worker. She never\ncalled her supervisor about getting another staff. The nurse did. The co-worker\nnever showed prior to the incident. The person arrived around 9:00am, after the\nincident and after Resident A had left for the hospital.\nBoth Staff 2 and Staff 3 reported there were six residents on the unit and the\nfacility’s staff- to- resident ratio is 1:3. When Staff 2 took Resident A to the hospital\nthere were five residents on the unit with Staff 3.\nFurthermore, Staff 3 reported when she was standing with Resident A and Resident\nB both were calm. Then, Resident A got upset and Resident A dug her nails into her\nStaff 3’s wrist. Staff 3 did not restrain Resident A. She transported Resident A to\nResident A’s room by carrying Resident A. Staff 3 said she knew it wasn’t right, but\nshe made the “executive decision” to do what she did because he had been there\nalmost all morning going back and forth with trying to get Resident A to go to her\nroom. She said, “I grabbed her under her shoulders and lifted her off the floor” and\ntransported her to the room.\nAdministrator 0 indicated the staffing as reported during the interviews was\ncorrect. She said the first shift staff was late that day which was why the third shift\nstaff remained late to maintain ratio.\n8",
    "Administrator 0 indicated their policy did not include anything about not allowing\ntransports when they updated their restraint policy. Their discussion with their\nconsultant was a matter of whether they had a policy against it or not.\nReviewed:\nDocuments indicated earlier in this report.\nWhaley’s Physical Intervention- Restraint Policy which:\n Indicated the crisis intervention model that Whaley Children’s Center utilizes\nis the Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI) model, which emphasizes verbal\nde-escalation and active listening skills to diffuse crisis situations. The TCI\nmodel does include physical restraint strategies that are utilized as the last\nresort to maintain safety.\n Does not address appropriate or inappropriate transport. Nor whether a staff\nuse of carrying a child by picking the child up under their arms or shoulders is\nto occur.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-to-\nresident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: The agency did not adhere to its 1:3 staff-to-resident ratio.\nStaff 3 was supervising six residents by herself for a number of\nhours prior to the incident. Staff 2 intervened to assist Staff 3\nsometime prior to Resident A’s injury. Once Resident A was\ntaken to the hospital by Staff 2, Staff 3 was left with five\nresidents for a period of time.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specially addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\n9",
    "ANALYSIS: Staff 3 admitted she went under Resident A’s shoulders and\nlifted Resident A off the floor and carried Resident A to Resident\nA’s bedroom. She reported knowing that method of transport\nwas not proper but made the “executive decision” to use it.\nThe agency’s physical intervention policy does not\naddress/describe resident transport. Clear policy is needed.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the facility\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\nOctober 12, 2020\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 13, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n10"
