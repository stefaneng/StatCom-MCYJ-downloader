Staff 1\nreported he started working at the facility at the end of March 2024.\nHe reported he has been working with Supervisor 1 who is coaching\nhim on working on an all-female unit.

Staff\n1 reported he attempted to build rapport with Youth B and noted she\ncame from where he grew up. He reported he asked her if she was\nrelated to anyone with a certain last name and she stated a guy\nrapped her by that last name. Staff 1 reported he was taken aback\nfor a second as the guy he was thinking of was someone different\nand was not aware of her trauma history. He reported he did not\nhave much interaction with Youth A and noted that he had to block\nher from trying to get attention from the male youth unit. Staff 1\nreported there was an incident he wanted to mention where Youth C\nand Youth D were fighting.

She reported Staff 1 talked to her about living in the\nsame town she was from and asked her about knowing someone\nwho had caused her trauma in the past. Youth C reported she did not\n4",
    "want to talk further about that because it is traumatizing and has not\nbrought up this concern to anyone else. She reported Staff 1 has\nnever touched anyone inappropriately. Youth C reported there was a\ntime when Youth C got into a fight and she pushed her body up on\nStaff 1, which he then backed away.

She asked Youth C why she did not like Staff\n1, and she reported that she does not like any male staff.

She\nreported Youth C stated Staff 1 called her his girl and she processed\nwith her about this.
