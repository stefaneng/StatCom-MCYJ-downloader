    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted after a report that a youth in foster care had not received her Independent Living stipend check and was unable to contact the agency. The investigation found the youth did eventually receive her check by contacting her assigned worker, and the youth later stated she had initially used the wrong contact number for the agency. The report concludes no policy violation was established. Overall, while there was a lapse in communication and a delayed check delivery around the holidays, the agency's ultimate response and the youth's access to a worker cleared them of formal culpability.",
