    "within 30 calendar days after placement in independent\nliving and updated at least once every 90 calendar days:\n(o) Service plans as required in R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420. If the youth has biological children, the\nservice plan must address the living arrangement for the\nchild or children, visitation/parenting time with the youth's\nbiological children or a clear explanation why this is not\npossible or appropriate.\nTwo of eight service plans reviewed (related to one of three open independent living\nyouth records reviewed) were three and five days late respectively.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:.\n• Nothing this inspection\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nR400.12509(3)(o) Service plans.\nThe agency must gain a clearer understanding of the timeframe requirement for\neach service plan period and how to accurately document this on the service\nplan. I provided the agency with consultation in this area.\nR400.12511(1) Termination.\nThe agency was advised consistently completing all areas of its discharge\ndocuments might aid it in showing clearer compliance to the rule.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan during this\nlicensing period. The corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2022 Renewal\ninspection where it received the following rule violations:\n• R400.12212(3)(a) Personnel records.\n• R400.12503(2)(j) Termination.\n3",
    "• R400.12510(2) Independence living record.\nThe agency made progress on this corrective action plan but was not totally\nsuccessful with all areas of the corrective action plan. The agency received one\nrepeat violation, as indicated in this inspection report.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 10/27/2023. The report\nwas completed as required by the rule. No areas of concern were noted.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted an annual budget, and a 9/30/2022 independent financial\naudit, which did not show any areas of concern.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to engaging with the program coordinator, and communication with the\nchief administrator, I interviewed a case manager and two transitional youth\nspecialists. The staff reported positives about the agency’s program and the\nefforts that are put forth to assist youths.\nThree youths were interviewed. All the youths reported that the staff are\nsupportive, encouraging; and that the program works to help youth reach\nindependent living.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk though of the facility did not reveal any concerns or safety issues.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNot applicable. This is an independent living program.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nOctober 29, 2023\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n4",
