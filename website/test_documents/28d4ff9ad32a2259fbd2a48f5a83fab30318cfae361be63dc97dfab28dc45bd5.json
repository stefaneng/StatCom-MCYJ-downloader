    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was being held with a warrant at the facility and wouldn't\nrelease him. It is alleged that the court operated facility cannot\ndetail youth with a warrant from the courts.\nYouth B was allegedly detained at the facility after his case was\ndismissed and there no longer was an order for detention.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI left a message for Complainant on 7/29/25 and 8/14/25. No\nreturn call was received.\nOn 7/29/25, I interviewed Administrator via telephone and\ncompleted a follow up on 8/5/25 face to face at the facility.\nAdministrator reported the facility is a court operated facility.\nAdministrator reported youth are received from circuit court and\ndistrict court. Youth that come from the circuit court have a “pick\nup order” that allows the detainment of youth at the facility. If the\nyouth come in from the district court (adult court), then the youth\nare detained with a warrant. The youth are rarely sent directly\nfrom district court to the facility, but it does happen on occasion.\nThe “pick up order” and the warrant hold the same authority; one\nis just used with minor children coming from the circuit court and\nthe latter with youth charged as adults. For circuit court, youth are\nusually arraigned 24-48 hours and then a court order for continual\nstay or release is issued. For district court, they would hold the\nyouth until their preliminary hearing, or a release is provided by\nthe courts.\nAdministrator reported Youth A was received from the circuit court\non 7/11/25. He was given an order to detain Youth A with a 5-day\nwaiver. On 7/16/25, a warrant was ordered by the district court to\ndetain at the facility. This was completed at approximately\n3:30pm. In the evening Judge came to facility at 6:30pm and\nconducted a preliminary hearing to ensure Youth A’s detainment.\nNot only did Youth A have the warrant to hold him there but also\nthe court order. On 7/17/25, a formal hearing was completed for\nYouth A, and he was released on a tether.\nYouth B was received from circuit court on 1/3/25. They had an\norder to detain, and his next circuit hearing was to be completed\non 1/29/25. On 1/21/25, a warrant was entered by the court to\ndetain Youth B. Youth B was already detained. A waiver hearing\nwas completed on 1/24/25 where he was waved over to district\ncourt. In this situation there was an overlap of district and circuit\n2",
    "jurisdiction, but either way, they had authority from the courts to\ndetain Youth B.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nProgram Statement: Licensed Court Operated facility for the\npurpose of supporting justice and public safety by providing short\nterm programming for male and female youth ages 10-18 years of\nage and who are court ordered into the Justice Center pending the\ncourt’s disposition of the youth’s case.\nYouth A:\n• Order After Preliminary Hearing dated 7/11/25 to detain\nYouth A until 7/16/25, resumption of the preliminary\nhearing.\n• Detention Order (circuit court) dated 7/16/25 to release\nYouth A at 4:26pm and district court warrant to detain\nyouth.\n• Pretrial Release Order dated 7/17/25 to release Youth A.\n• Release Summary dated 7/17/25. Youth A was released to\nhis grandmother.\nYouth B:\n• Circuit Court Petition dated 1/3/25 noted to detain Youth\nB at the facility.\n• Notice of Hearing dated 1/3/25; Youth B is to remain\ndetained pending his next hearing. Next hearing is 1/29/25.\n• District Court Pretrial Release Order dated 1/24/25.\nFacility was to detain Youth B until bond of $50,000 was\nmade. The order expires on 7/24/25.\n• District Court Pretrial Release Amended Lein\nExpiration Date dated 6/4/25, extended the order to detain\nYouth B “until bond is posted and the terms and conditions\nspecified in item 5 are acknowledged…”\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. The agency is licensed as\na court operated facility. The facility detains youth based on court\norders. Both Youth A and Youth B were court ordered to be\ndetained at the facility. Youth B is still in placement due to not\ncompleting the requirements in the court order, bail $50,000. All\norders give the facility legal authority to detain youth, whether\ncoming from circuit court or district court.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n8/14/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
