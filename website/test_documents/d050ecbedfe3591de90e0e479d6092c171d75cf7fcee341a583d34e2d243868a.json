TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility did not require technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP (approved 10/28/20) was a result\nof the 10/7/20 interim review. The CAP addressed violations regarding 312 Foster\nparent training, 413 medical and dental care, FOM 722-08C PATP signatures, FOM\n722-09 service plans, and 722-06b Family team meetings. With the exception of\ntimely PATP signatures, there were no repeat violations during this review period.\nThe agency has successfully implemented their CAP. However, staff report to\ncontinue having difficulty getting parents to sign the PATP in a timely manner. A new\nCAP will be developed to address this.\n5",
