He confirmed that at that moment Youth A was in the\nhospital after he had been transported from school for self-\nharming and assaultive behaviors. The Program Director\nconfirmed Youth A had punched a window in the evening of\n05/11/2024. He received medical attention from a visit to an\nurgent care site after school on 05/13/2024. The Program\nDirector stated Youth A had an appointment scheduled for\n05/17/2024 with a hand specialist to determine if the boxer’s\nfracture required surgery as a result of the injury sustained.\nYouth B was interviewed on 05/16/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. He stated\nthat he saw Youth A punch a window twice on 05/11/2024, and\nlater that evening he believed he witnessed Youth A’s hand\nbeginning to swell up. Youth B also recalled Youth A was in his\nroom alone on that same date, and Youth B witnessed Youth A\npunch a wall. Youth B recalled staff being nearby for both\ninstances of punching, but he could not recall which staff this was.\n2",
    "He believed Staff 2 was in the kitchen cooking dinner when Youth\nA punched the window. Youth B recalled seeing staff members\nlook at Youth A’s hand and offer him pain medication in response.\nYouth B stated Youth A was heard throughout the next day\ncomplaining of his hand being in pain.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 05/16/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. He stated\nhe had worked the previous Saturday when Youth A punched a\nwindow. Staff 1 clarified he did not witness Youth A punch\nanything himself. He ended his shift at 10:00pm and stated he\nnever saw Youth A upset nor did he see his hand appear to swell\nover the course of the evening.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 05/16/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at the facility. She\nstated she worked the previous Saturday with Youth A. Staff 2\nstated the punch of the window did not directly involve her, but\nStaff 3 was present supervising Youth A when this occurred. Staff\n2 recalled Staff 3 telling her that he believed Youth A needed to go\nto the doctor after the incident. Staff 2 believed that it was Staff 3\nthat called Supervisor 1 to inform of the incident and discuss how\nto handle it. Staff 2 believed a trip to urgent care was approved\nbut Youth A did not want to go at that moment. Staff 2’s shift\nended at about 8:00pm that evening and she recalled Youth A had\nnot been transported to urgent care by that point in time. Staff 2\ndid not witness Youth A’s hand herself. She stated she did not\nwork the following day and she saw Youth A on Monday afternoon\nand witnessed his hand wrapped at that time.\nYouth A was interviewed on 05/16/2024 with DHHS Worker 1\nduring an unannounced, face-to-face visit at a local hospital.\nYouth A was being assessed at the hospital because he had\nsignificant concerning behaviors earlier in the day at school and\nthe school requested, he be transported for medical care. Youth\nA confirmed he punched a window by the front door to his cottage.\nYouth A also recalled punching the wall in his room earlier that\nsame day. Youth A stated Staff 3 was with him when he punched\nthe window. He could not recall what Staff 3 did or said in that\nmoment. Youth A could not remember if any staff had asked him\nto go with them to get medical attention for his hand after this\noccurred, and he did not think he refused to go either. Youth A\nstated he received Motrin the following day from an unknown staff\nmember to help with the pain in his hand. He stated he did not\nreceive any ice for his hand until the following Monday at school.\nYouth A recalled his hand appeared to swell that same night after\n3",
    "the incident occurred. He could not recall if he told anyone that\nhis hand hurt. Youth A stated he had been wrapping his hand in a\nshirt over that weekend and Staff 2 helped him wrap his hand at\nsome point, but he could not recall when.\nA video conference meeting was arranged by the DHHS Foster\nCare Worker for Youth A for 06/06/2024. During this meeting it\nwas confirmed Youth A was not going to require surgery for the\nfracture in his hand and would more likely need a hard cast to help\nit heal. It was also discussed that the wrapping and soft cast that\nhad been provided to him had produced difficulties because Youth\nA would commonly remove them at the facility and at school.\nPrevious injuries for Youth A produced similar behaviors, where\nhe would not keep a soft cast boot on his foot when necessary.\nNurse 1 from the facility stated staff never told Youth A to remove\nhis wrapping or soft cast and he was doing this on his own.\nNurse 2, who works with the school in which Youth A attended\nand not the facility, stated Youth A was commonly coming to\nschool with the wrap undone or too loose and school staff were re-\nwrapping this on a daily basis. She stated Youth A informed her\nhe was not doing this on his own and staff at the facility had not\nwrapped it well or at all on occasion.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker 1 on\n06/06/2024. Staff 3 confirmed he had worked with Youth A on the\nevening when he punched the window. Staff 3 stated Youth A\nbegan to get upset at another youth over the course of the day\nand this is what caused him to punch the door window located in\nthe vestibule of the cottage. Staff 3 recalled hearing Youth A state\nthat his hand hurt after the incident occurred. As an immediate\nremedy, Staff 3 recalled looking for any ice bags and not finding\nany. He believed there was another staff who was going to get\nsome frozen vegetables to act as the same for Youth A. Staff 3\nstated he called Supervisor 1 after the incident occurred to\ndiscuss how to handle it. Staff 3 recalled Supervisor 1 speaking\ndirectly with Youth A, and Supervisor 1 did not give specific\ninstructions to take Youth A for medical attention at that time.\nStaff 3 recalled telling Youth A that “if your hand is still hurting, we\nwill take you to urgent care.” Staff 3 believed Youth A stated in\nresponse “Okay.” Staff 3 interpreted that as Youth A would tell\nhim if he felt like he needed to go, and that the decision to seek\nmedical care was with Youth A at that point. Staff 3 stated he did\nnot work with Youth A until the following Monday afternoon, after\nYouth A received medical attention. Staff 3 confirmed Youth A\nwas not seen by any facility medical staff while Staff 3 was on shift\nbecause the nursing staff does not work on weekends.\n4",
    "Supervisor 1 was interviewed over the phone with DHHS Worker\n1 on 06/06/2024. He confirmed he was the on call supervisor on\nthe weekend where Youth A had this incident. Supervisor 1\nrecalled Youth A not wanting to go to the hospital or urgent care\nafter the incident occurred. He believed Youth A asked if he could\njust take pain medication instead of getting other medical\nattention. Supervisor 1 recalled giving instruction to Staff 3 that if\nStaff 3 assessed Youth A as needing further medical attention, he\nwas approved to transport Youth A to the local hospital or urgent\ncare. Supervisor 1 stated Youth A never expressed to him that his\nhand felt bad enough to need more attention. Supervisor 1 stated\nto Youth A “If you feel like you need to go, just tell me you need to\ngo.” Supervisor 1 recalled Youth A’s behavior being confusing\nbecause he would say that his hand hurt but he would also\nhorseplay and instigate physical activity with other youth and staff.\nSupervisor 1 recalled he never told staff to not take Youth A in for\nmedical attention. Supervisor 1 stated he worked the following\nday and he did not hear Youth A comment about his hand hurting,\nnor did he witness Youth A’s hand and if it was swollen. He could\nnot confirm if he asked Youth A how his hand was feeling.\nSupervisor 1 recalled Youth A horseplaying and playing football\non that Sunday.\nOn a video conference that occurred on 06/10/2024, DHHS\nFoster Care Worker reported that there was concern over the\nfacility’s ability to help Youth A follow medical guidelines after the\ninjury. She stated the week following the incident there was a\nhard insert that was provided to Youth A in lieu of an eventual\nhard cast. DHHS Foster Care Worker stated this hard insert was\nnot wrapped to Youth A’s hand as instructed for that full week until\nher next face-to-face contact with Youth A.\nDuring a video conference meeting on 06/10/2024 DHHS Worker\n1 stated her investigation was not yet completed and did not have\nfindings that could be provided.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Incident report documentation dated 05/11/2024 was\nprovided and reviewed. This was authored by Staff 3 and\napproved by Supervisor 1. It stated Youth A got upset with\nanother youth and punched the front door glass, and in\nresponse was given ice for his hand at approximately\n6:30pm that evening. A question of was the child injured\nwas answered yes, specifically noting the right hand of\nYouth A.\n5",
    "• Notes written by staff working in Youth A’s cottage from the\ndate of 05/11/2024 were provided and reviewed. It was\ndocumented by Staff 3 that Youth A had hurt his hand\nhitting a window and he was given an ice pack.\n• There was no documentation gathered that referenced\nYouth A stating any refusals to go to the hospital or urgent\ncare for medical attention at any point in time, nor was\nthere documentation gathered that detailed any staff\nassessing Youth A as not needing external medical\nattention.\n• Medical documentation dated 05/13/2024 from Youth A’s\nvisit to Ascension St. John hospital was provided and\nreviewed. He was diagnosed with a boxer’s fracture in his\nright hand and follow up attention was needed from an\northopedic surgeon.\n• On 06/06/2024 the Program Director confirmed there was\nno video footage that captured the act of Youth A punching\nany windows or walls from the date of 05/11/2024.\n• Facility policy titled “Medical Emergencies” was provided\nand reviewed. This was last revised on 09/01/2021.\no A section titled “When to call 911” included\ninstruction to seek external medical attention when a\nyouth experiences a fracture.\no Further instruction for staff to not move the injured\npart of their body if swollen.\no There was no instruction written in this policy and\nprocedure on how to determine if medical attention\nis needed when a Youth appears to be in pain but\nalso states otherwise.\no In a section providing instruction on youth injuries\nthat do not require external medical attention it was\nstated that staff are required to write an incident\nreport for all hospitalizations or injuries and where\nthere is any doubt of a situation to document it.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance with the rule cited as there\nwas enough evidence to support Youth A injured his hand to the\npoint of swelling, pain that required over-the-counter medication,\nwrapping to support the hand and the facility did not ensure that\nhe received medical attention from the evening of 05/11/2024 to\nthe afternoon of 05/13/2024, when he was diagnosed with a\nfracture of his hand.\nTechnical Assistance:\nYouth B reported in his interview on 05/16/2024 that he had over-\nthe-counter pain medication in his room and offered this to Youth\n6",
    "A on 05/12/2024 because Youth A was stating that his hand\nhurt. This was not corroborated by Youth A. Attention and\nclarification on the policies and procedures for over-the-counter\nmedications in their provision and storage would help prevent a\nyouth from accumulating medication without staff’s awareness.\nFurther technical assistance was offered in the area of\ndocumentation of a youth’s refusal of medical attention. If this\noccurred it would be best to have clear documentation in the\nincident report or cottage notes of what medical assistance was\noffered to a youth and what their response was, and when staff\nattempted to again offer assistance despite the youth’s resistance.\nConsultation:\nDuring the process of this investigation there was communication\nbetween the facility, case management for Youth A and his school\nregarding the overall care of Youth A. It was apparent there had\nbeen some lack of communication between all parties on sharing\ninformation of medical appointments and teaming of decisions\nresulting from this medical attention, and consultation was\nprovided regarding the importance of that teaming to best\naccomplish any care or medical follow through needed for youth in\nthe program.\nConsultation was also offered around exploring facility procedures\nin the event of a possible injury to a youth over the course of\nafterhours or weekend times. Facility nursing and medical staff\nare not available at those times and any exploration of how to\nassess possible injuries outside of front-line staff’s efforts would\nbe beneficial.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n06/21/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n7/12/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n8"
