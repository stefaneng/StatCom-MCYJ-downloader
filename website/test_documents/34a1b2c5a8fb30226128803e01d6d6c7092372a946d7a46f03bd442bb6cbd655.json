    "Supervisor 1 was interviewed on 04/04/2023 during an\nannounced face-to-face visit at the facility. Supervisor 1 stated\nthat his involvement with the incident began with him being in the\nmain building on campus when he was alerted to an altercation\nbeginning in the unit. He stated that he then ran to the unit. When\nSupervisor 1 entered, he quickly called an “emergency procedure”\nwhich is when every youth goes into their rooms with their doors\nopen to allow for de-escalation to occur with anyone who is\nstruggling. Supervisor 1 stated that he was working to get Youth B\ninto his own room when he turned around and saw the part of the\nincident where Staff 2 and Youth A fell to the floor. At that point in\ntime Supervisor 1 recalled Staff 1 being in their vicinity but not yet\nbeing physically involved in the incident. Supervisor 1 stated that\nhe could not exactly say how or why Youth A and Staff 2 fell to the\nground, but did state that he believed Youth A was very escalated\nand looking to attack either Staff 2 or Youth C at that point.\nSupervisor 1 stated that his first sight was the two individuals\nfalling and seeing Staff 2 on the left side of Youth A. Supervisor 1\nstated that he saw Youth A fall and stay face down on the ground.\nSupervisor 1 believed it only took him a couple of seconds to run\nover to the three individuals. During this entire part of the incident,\nSupervisor 1 stated that Youth A was cussing and swearing and\nthreatening Youth C. Supervisor 1 recalled that when he first\napproached Youth A and Staff 2, he stepped over to Youth A’s\nright side to allow Staff 2 to get off of Youth A and not put any\nweight on him. Supervisor 1 stated that he had his hand on the\nback of Youth A’s shoulder and that he immediately was telling\nhim “We need to get you off the floor” and “May we pick you up.”\nSupervisor 1 stated that his objective in that moment was to get\nYouth A up off the ground fully. Supervisor 1 stated that Youth A\nstill had the pencils in his hand that he had previously tried to\nattack Youth C and/or Staff 2 with, and Staff 1 was able to get\nthose out of Youth A’s hand after an initial struggle, because\nYouth A did not appear to want to give them up. Supervisor 1\nstated that it only took about 45 seconds for Youth A to appear\nready to comply and he and Staff 2 lifted Youth A off the ground.\nSupervisor 1 recalled that Youth A got up under his own power\nand helped walk him to his room. Supervisor 1 stated that he just\nhad his hands around Youth A’s shoulder at this point and that\nYouth A was walking voluntarily. Supervisor 1 stated that Youth A\nwas still very upset after this incident but that there were no other\ninstances of physical contact with him, despite that afterwards.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 04/04/2023 during an announced face-\nto-face visit at the facility. She recalled being involved in the\nincident in question. Staff 1 stated that she was the staff who was\n4",
    "with the youth in the gym when Youth A poured water over Youth\nC’s head, causing him to be upset. Staff 1 stated that there was\nno physical escalation during this part of the incident, and she\nstated that the unit returned to their building sometime later. As\nthe youth were settling down in their rooms with their doors open,\nYouth C went over to Youth A’s room and started to escalate.\nStaff 1 stated that she saw Youth C attempt to throw punches at\nYouth A, but that Staff 2 was in between them with her hands up\nand was able to keep the two youth apart in some form. Staff 1\nstated that she ran over to the situation and in doing so Youth C\nshoved her down into a nearby couch as he walked away. Staff 1\nrecalled hurting her wrist in the fall and it took her a minute to get\nback up and moving around. Staff 1 stated that Youth A was pretty\nescalated at this point in time, yelling at Youth C and threatening\nhim as well as attempting to get past Staff 2. Staff 1 stated the\nnext thing she remembered was that Staff 2 was able to verbally\nredirect Youth C to his own room, only to see Youth A run past her\nwith two pencils in his hands. Staff 1 stated that Youth A tried to\nget around Staff 2 to Youth C and was using a stabbing motion\nwith the pencils. Staff 1 believed that Staff 2 was hit by Youth A\nduring this part of the interaction. She recalled hearing Youth A\nyelling “I’m going to kill” Youth C, as well as how he was going to\n“slice him in his sleep.” Staff 1 stated as she was approaching she\nsaw Youth A and Staff 2 fall to the ground, but could not see what\nexactly caused this. Staff 1 recalled that Youth A was lying face\ndown when he first was on the ground and that she immediately\nattempted to get the pencils out of his hands. Staff 1 stated that\nshe was able to do this after a short struggle. Staff 1 believed that\nYouth A was only on the ground for 30 seconds or so, and that\nStaff 2 and Supervisor 1 were able to calm him and help him get\nup to the point where he was less of a safety risk. Staff 1 believed\nthat Supervisor 1 took Youth A to his room at that point. She was\nnot around Youth A for the next few hours.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 04/04/2023 during an announced face-\nto-face visit at the facility. Supervisor 2 sat in on the interview as\nwell as he is the facility operations manager and the main trainer\nfor their chosen restraint model. She stated that she was with Staff\n1 and the rest of the youth in the unit while at the gym when Youth\nA dumped water on Youth C, and Staff 2 believed that this was\nthe beginning of the entire incident. She stated that there were no\nsigns of pending physical aggression or escalation immediately\nafter that, or as the unit walked back to their building and settled\ninto their rooms. Staff 2 stated that once everyone was back in the\nunit and in the rooms, she was concerned that Youth C was going\nto escalate, and she called Supervisor 1 to ask for assistance.\n5",
    "Staff 2 recalled that Youth C went over to Youth A’s room and\nattempted to fight Youth A. Staff 2 stated that she was able to get\nin between the youth to attempt to prevent any punches from\nlanding and that she caught a punch in the chest from Youth C in\nthe process. She also recalled that Youth A swung a chair and hit\nher in the process of blocking him from hitting Youth C. Very\nquickly Youth C returned to his own room from what Staff 2 could\nrecall. Staff 2 stated that she followed Youth C in an attempt to\nmake sure he stayed in his room and was not directly near Youth\nA at this point during the incident. She stated that she next saw\nYouth A as he was running towards both of them and she noticed\nthat he had pencils in his hands. She stated that she was stabbed\nin her front shoulder by one of the pencils as Youth A was trying to\nget to Youth C, but that this was caused by her attempting to stay\nin between the youth. She stated that Youth A was swinging wildly\nat this point. Staff 2 stated that she attempted to put her hands on\nYouth A near his shirt collar in order to better control him and that,\nin doing so, they both went to the ground. Staff 2 recalled that\nYouth A fell face first and was lying face down on the ground at\nthat point. Staff 2 stated that she moved herself off of Youth A’s\nback and attempted to hold his wrist down so that Staff 1 could\ntake the pencils away from him. Staff 2 recalled Youth A was\ncussing and screaming, stating something to the effect of “I’m still\ngoing to kill” Youth C. Staff 2 stated that she was still over the\nback of Youth A at this point, but that she was on her knees and\ndoing everything she could to not put weight on him. She recalled\nthat Supervisor 1 quickly came over and Staff 2 was able to let go\nof Youth A’s right wrist, so that Supervisor 1 could take it and\nassist in trying to de-escalate Youth A. Staff 2 stated that this part\nof the incident lasted only about a minute and that Youth A got up\nunder his own power and Supervisor 1 assisted in removing Youth\nA from the area near Youth C’s room. Staff 2 recalled that Youth A\nattempted to shove her on his way, getting up from being on the\nground, and that she instinctively pushed him back. At that point\nStaff 2 stated that she intentionally walked away from the\nsituation, as Supervisor 1 was with Youth A in order to swap out\nand ensure that Youth A did not continue to escalate because of\nher presence. She stated that, even though she had tried to move\naway from the situation, she was still concerned that he might\nattempt to go back to Youth C, but he did not in that moment. Staff\n2 stated that her immediate role after the incident was to help\nmanage the rest of the youth and that other staff worked with\nYouth A as he was still upset.\nDocuments reviewed:\n6",

All three staff are up to date on training for\nthis chosen restraint model.\n No discipline in personnel files were noted for Supervisor 1,\nStaff 1 and Staff 2.\n Training materials from the facility were reviewed.

In the facility’s policies and procedures, it states\nthat staff can only utilize physical management “if there is\nan unanticipated or severe threat of danger to an\nindividual.”\n Two incident reports specific to Youth A and Youth C dated\n03/18/2023 were provided. Specific to the restraint and fall\nto the floor, the incident report regarding Youth C states\n“Staff 2 attempted to place Youth A in a standing hold.\nThey were unsuccessful in doing so. Staff 2 put her hands\naround the shoulder area of Youth A and used an improper\ntechnique. This caused both to go to the ground.”\n Video footage of the incident in question was viewed. The\nspecific moment pertinent to this rule occurs at\napproximately 12:11. During the altercation Staff 2 ended\nup standing directly behind Youth A with her arms over his\nshoulders. Her arms are reaching over his shoulders and\nStaff 2 throws Youth A to the ground in a clockwise motion,\ncausing her to fall to the ground over the top of him at the\nsame time. After Youth A is brought to his feet, he appears\nto be more calm. Staff 2 pushes Youth A in the chest.\nYouth A is able to stay on his feet and is then escorted to\nhis room by Supervisor 1.\nAnalysis Through interviews with staff and youth, video and documentation\nreviewed, it is found that there was a violation to this rule as Staff\n2 throws Youth A down to the ground A and then pushes Youth A.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Resident restraint.\nSection (2) The following restraints are strictly prohibited:\nDescription (e)Restraining youth in a prone position or any restraint that\nrestricts the youth’s airway.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation During the course of the restraint Youth A was prone on the\nground for a period of time.\nInvestigation Through the interviews with Youth A, Supervisor 1, Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 it was determined that Youth A fell face down on to the\nground during the physical interaction with Staff 2 and remained\n7",
    "there until he was helped to his feet roughly a minute later. While\nlying on his stomach in a prone position Staff 2 and Supervisor 1\nhad their hands on Youth A until he got up on his feet.\nDocuments reviewed:\n Training materials from the facility were reviewed. The\nfacility uses an approved model for restraints, Nonviolent\nCrisis Intervention training through Crisis Prevention\nInstitute. Excerpts from the facility’s policies state that “in\nthe event that a restraint ends up on the floor due to the\nstudent struggling the staff have the following options:\n1) Disengage with the youth. If the youth is still\nexhibiting dangerous behaviors and meets the criteria\nfor physical management, staff are able to reengage\nthe student once he stands up.\n2) Help bring the student back up to his knees or\nstanding position. This needs to be done without the\nuse of force.\n3) In extenuating circumstances students may be\ntransitioned to a supine position per the NCVI\nadvanced skills.”\n Incident report for Youth A for the incident in question. This\ndocumentation corroborates the length of time that Youth A\nwas on the floor with staff and youth interviews.\n Video footage of the incident in question was viewed.\nYouth A and Staff 2 fall to the ground at the 12:11 mark of\nthe video. Youth A is in a prone, face down position from\nthis point until 12:12.

At 12:12 Staff 2 moves her right leg over the\nbackside of Youth A and kneels next to him.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face interviews with youth and staff, video and\ndocuments reviewed it is determined that there was a rule\nviolation because Youth A was in a prone position and an\nalternative physical intervention was not immediately used.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2022C0103008 dated 03/21/2022, CAP Approved 04/06/2022\nSIR 2021C0103033 dated 10/11/2021, CAP Approved 10/26/2021\nSIR 2021C0214025 dated 10/20/2021, CAP Approved 11/15/2021\nSIR 2021C0207017 dated 07/06/2021, CAP Approved 08/04/2021\n8",
