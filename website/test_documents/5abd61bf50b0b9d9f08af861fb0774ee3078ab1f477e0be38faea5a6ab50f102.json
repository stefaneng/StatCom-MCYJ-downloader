Consultant 1 reported this is a recently licensed short term facility with little\nplacement history.\n2",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 04/13/2021. Staff 1 stated she is a direct care staff\nand is also an educational liaison. Staff 1 aided in providing related documentation that\nwas requested. Staff 1 reported that Youth A told Staff 1 that Youth A wanted to go to\nthe hospital for an HIV test. Staff 1 asked why, and Youth A reported he wasn’t feeling\nwell, had an upset stomach and Youth A and Youth B had sex the previous night. Staff\n1 stated Youth A alleged he performed oral sex on Youth B and Youth B performed anal\nsex on Youth A. Youth A alleged it happened around midnight on 03/27/2021 and they\nwere done by 12:20 AM on 03/27/2021. Staff 1 interviewed Youth B about activities the\nprevious night without presenting the allegations by Youth A. Youth B reported he used\nhis computer and the only interaction between Youth A and Youth B was their typical\nconversation. Staff 1 documented checking with other staff and reviewing the logbook\nand based on their conversations the staff had doubts about the truth of Youth A’s\nallegations but referred it to Administrator 1 for follow up.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 at the facility on 04/13/2021. Administrator 1 stated that\nboth youth involved in the alleged incident have been discharged from the facility.\nAdministrator 1 provided contact information for me to contact the youth involved.\nAdministrator 1 stated he contacted the parents of Youth A and Youth B about the\nallegations. Administrator 1 described Youth A as having a history of inappropriate\nsexual behaviors or allegations.\nAdministrator 1 reported he interviewed Youth B about Youth A’s allegations.\nAdministrator 1 stated Youth B stated he was straight and denied the allegations.\nAdministrator 1 described Youth B’s body language as being consistent with telling the\ntruth. Youth B admitted he was on his computer and showed Administrator 1 his you\ntube history and emails. There were no emails to Youth A.\nAdministrator 1 reported he interviewed Youth A about the allegations. Youth A\nreported Youth B asked Youth A via email if Youth A wanted or did oral sex. Youth A\nalso alleged Youth B penetrated Youth A but did not say where or with what. Youth A\nstated it was consensual.\nI interviewed Youth A’s mother by telephone on 05/27/2021. Youth A’s mother said she\nhas heard Youth A’s “side of the story” and reported that to her knowledge the police\nare not involved. I interviewed Youth A by telephone on 05/27/2021. Youth A did not\ngo into detail about what allegedly happened. Youth A stated the staff were doing room\nchecks every 15 minutes. Youth A stated the incident was only once and lasted about\n10 minutes. Youth A stated they were both in the same room with 5 beds in the room.\nYouth A stated he was at the facility for 30 days and it was helpful. Youth A did not say\nanything negative about the facility and staff and seemed to be concerned that Youth\nA’s allegations would have a negative impact on the facility.\nI interviewed Youth B’s father by telephone on 05/27/2021. Youth B’s father stated the\npolice had spoken to Youth B and indicated they would not be pursuing any action as\nYouth B denied the allegations. I interviewed Youth B by telephone on 05/27/2021 and\n3",
    "Youth B denied the allegations and did not know why Youth A would have made the\nallegations. Youth B also stated the staff were making room checks at the facility.\nThe room check log was reviewed and indicated room checks were being completed.\nThe time period in question indicated that at 12:00 and 12:15 all the youth were asleep.\nYouth A was awake at 12:30 and Youth A did get up at 12:40 to go to the bathroom.\nAdditional room check times were 10:15, 10:30, 10:45, 11:00, 11:12, 11:29, 11:45,\n12:40, 12:43, 1:00, 1:14, 1:28, 1:47, 2:01, 2:17, 2:30, 2:45, 3:01, 3:15, 3:30, 3:40, 3:58,\n4:13, 4:30, 4:47, and 5:03.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval\nchecks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nANALYSIS: The findings of this investigation did not provide adequate\nevidence to substantiate the allegations made by Youth A.\nYouth B has consistently denied the allegations. The facility did\nprovide documentation that room checks were being completed.\nBoth Youth A and Youth B reported the staff were providing\nappropriate supervision and they described their time at this\nfacility as helpful/beneficial. The room check logs documented\nthat some room checks were being completed at intervals of\nfifteen minutes or less, but some room checks were\ndocumented as being completed outside the fifteen-minute\nparameter established by this rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend with the submission and acceptance of an approved corrective action\nplan the current license status of this child care institution-private be maintained.\n05/28/2021\n________________________________________\nMark R.
