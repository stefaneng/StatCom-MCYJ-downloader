A copy of the\ncourt order was received 4/17/2024.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator and Foster Care Worker by\nphone on 6/11/2024. Chief Administrator and Foster Care Worker\nboth reported parenting time had been implemented for Mother of\nYouth A following a court hearing on 4/16/2024 that authorized\nMother of Youth A to have parenting time with Youth A.
