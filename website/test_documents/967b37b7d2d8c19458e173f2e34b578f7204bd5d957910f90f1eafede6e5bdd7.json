    "• During the time of the onsite audit there was no consultation provided.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were 1 substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. This was within investigation report 2024C00008891SI dated 11/06/2023\nwhich found the facility in non-compliance of a staff member shoving a youth when\na youth was escalated. A corrective action plan dated 01/02/2024 was approved\nthat included the staff member involved being terminated from employment and\nimplementation of training and burnout check ins with supervisors.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nreview period begins September 18, 2023, until current. The agency was granted a\n1st Provisional License on September 18, 2023, due to Special Investigation\nReport 20223C0000595. Prior to the Provisional License being granted, there was\ntwo investigations still pending that ended up resulting in a CAP which were due to\nsupervision concerns, emergency restraint techniques not being utilized\nappropriately, and the documentation of the restraint was not completed timely.\nBoth CAPS were approved post the 1st Provisional License and action steps have\nbeen implemented. One CAP was the result of special investigation\n2023C0000753SI resulting in findings for supervision concerns due to a third shift\nstaff member sleeping. The facility implemented a CAP which terminated that staff\nmember who was sleeping, having increase live stream video reviews during third\nshift and a new position of a third shift team lead who would be a staff out of ratio\nto help support staff during third shift. The other CAP was the result of special\ninvestigation 2023C00007791 which resulted in findings as a staff member was\nnot keeping eyes on a youth when they exited the home without permission, going\ninto a restraint post a youth having escalating behaviors and documentation of the\nrestraint not being completed timely. Since this CAP implementation there has\nbeen scenario-based trainings on supervision requirements, increase in staff\ncoaching within increased supervision support, and re-training of the restraint\nmodel. All corrective action plans have been implemented and all action steps\nhave been met in the required timeframes.\nSince the start of the 1st Provisional License, September 18, 2023, there has been\n7 total investigations with 2 investigations resulting in compliance, 1 resulting in a\nCAP, and 4 investigations are still pending. The one investigation resulting in a\nCAP was report 2024C0000899SI as mentioned above. There are still 4 pending\ninvestigations at this time, which involved the following: Investigation\n2024C000088SI involves an incident that allegedly occurred on 9/12/2024, before\nthe facility enter provisional status, of a staff member potentially having an\ninappropriate relationship with a youth. Investigation 2024C0000043SI involves a\ncomplaint from a youth that lived in the facility in 2009-2011 and the staff involved",
    "in this investigation are no longer employed at the facility. Investigation\n2024C0001118 involves concerns of a staff member potentially providing a youth\nnicotine off campus. There is also a potential finding of a staff member being\naware of the situation and not reporting it until a few days later due to fear of that\nstaff member in question. Investigation 2024C00001122SI involves concern of\nstaff supervision during an off campus outing which allowed two youth to have\nsexual intercourse. The pending investigations are either about incidents prior to\nthe first provisional or a situation that occurred off campus grounds which is not\nsimilar to the concerns that led the facility into first provisional status.\nThe facility was placed on a 1st Provisional License due to concerns of staff not\nhaving adequate supervision which has led to youth being in unsafe situation. The\nfacility has implemented all of their CAPS which involve supervisors completing\nvideo review of shifts, quality assurance staff completing video review for every\nincident report and pulling random time video reviews, having in real time video\nreview occurring, and having instant feedback with staff both positive and negative\nin regard to findings from the video review. The facility also completed scenario-\nbased trainings to have staff engaged about importance of supervision guidelines\nand child safety. The facility implemented a third shift lead worker role which\nallows a veteran third shift staff member provide real time training and feedback to\nthird shift staff. This role also allows for a third shift worker to be out of ratio so that\nsupport can be provided. The facility implemented increased supervision with the\nsupervisors and direct care staff. The supervisors also complete a weekly tasks\nchecklist to provide to their supervisors of the individual supervision they have\ncompleted, reviewing checklist completions at the homes, reviewing video footage,\nreviewing specifically third shift video footage, and also completing reviews of daily\nobservation records. Majority of the facilities special investigation were reported to\nstate licensing by the facility staff themselves. They took appropriate steps when\nan investigation occurred by putting any at risk staff on leave immediately and\nterminating when found staff were not completing their duties appropriately. The\nfacility is working on proactive solutions including changing their hiring process to\ninclude specific questions for potential candidates of scenario basis. The facility\nhas had a change in leadership with downsizing and letting go their program\nmanager. The previous program manager did not have experience with the child\ncaring institution rules which posed barriers within his role. The Chief Administrator\nnow directly oversees the four supervisors. The Chief Administrator and home\nsupervisors will be involved in hiring the direct care staff. They are implementing\nthe Safety Systems: Abuse Prevention screening into their hiring process.\nSince being under a First Provisional License the facility completed weekly\nscheduled onsite meetings with this consultant and complied with monthly\nunannounced visits. The weekly scheduled onsite meeting occurred at the start of\nthe provisional September 19, 2024, and lasted until January 16, 2024. During\nthese weekly meetings, DCWL met with RCTAU and leadership at the facility.\nThese meetings consisted of review of CAPS and in the moment consultation or\ntechnical assistance that may be needed. Safety checks were also completed with",
    "all the youth who reported feeling safe at the facility and noted increased\nsupervision was occurring with staff.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility’s\nbudget and the agency’s financial audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator reported, \"The provisional CAP has been successful in\nachieving proper supervision of youth and ensuring staff issues are managed in a\nmore timely manner.\" The Chief Administrator notes that the video review process\nthat was noted in majority of the facility's CAPS has greatly improved real time\nfeedback to staff so they can remedy problems quickly. It has also provided an\nopportunity to provide positive feedback to staff, to reinforce positive behaviors.\nThe Chief Administrator plans to have continued video review variable home/shifts\nto ensure staff compliance with policy and procedure. The goal would be to have\nthe Quality Improvement Specialist review at least one time per month each direct\ncare staff member on shift. The facility also plans to incorporate the Safety\nSystems: Abuse Prevention Screen and hiring process to improve in hiring staff of\nhigh integrity.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff have reported they feel very supported by leadership and feel that when they\nhave a concern or question their voice is heard. Staff reported since going on a\nfirst provisional, there has been a shift in culture of working as a team and putting\nchild safety first. The staff reported they have enjoyed the scenario-based trainings\nas it more applicable to their jobs.\nYouth interviews were conducted during the inspection and no issues or concerns\nwere raised. The youth reported staff have been more on top of them with their\nroom checks and complete mental health checks with the youth. The youth\nreported they feel safe and have a positive relationship with the staff. They all\nreported whenever they have a concern and they express it to staff, the staff take it\nseriously and look into the situation.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nAn on-site inspection and walkthrough of the facility occurred on February 6, 2024.\nThere were no issues or safety concerns noted.",
