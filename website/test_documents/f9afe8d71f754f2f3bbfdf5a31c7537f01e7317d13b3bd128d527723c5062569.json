    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Resident restraint\nTitle\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10177.1\nSection (1) The facility shall establish and follow written policy and\nDescription procedures specifying the use of resident restraint.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 body slammed Youth A up in the air on the concrete inside\nof Unit SHU. Youth A was screaming and complaining of shoulder\nand arm pain. Youth A was not taken for medical attention nor\nwas Youth A medically evaluated at the Juvenile Detention\nCenter. Youth A’s whole body was shaking all day on 05/22/2024.\nInvestigation Several attempts were made to contact and interview\nComplainant but after leaving voice messages, Complainant\nnever responded.\nAdministrator 1 and Administrator 2 were interviewed face-to-\nface at the facility on 5/28/2024. Both reported the allegations\nare “misinformation” and it appears the complainant doesn’t really\nknow what is occurring with Youth A. They also reported the\nfacility has medical records indicating Youth A does not have a\nseizure disorder and this has been confirmed through medical\nassessments at the hospital. The facility is taking the appropriate\nsteps to provide for the care of Youth A especially with the serious\nproblems Youth A presents. Youth A is presenting with a very high\nsuicidal ideation and engages in self-harming behaviors quite\noften. Youth A tried to jump off Youth A’s bed in an attempt to\n“smash” Youth A’s head against the wall or mirror. Both report\nYouth A has been “relentless” in efforts for self-harm. The incident\noutlined in the allegations began in the school when Youth A took\na laptop computer and smashed it against a white board and\nstomped on it while the computer was on the floor. After receiving\na consequence for this behavior, Youth A was placed in Youth A’s\nroom. Once in Youth A’s room, Youth A stood on the bed and did\na “freefall” to the floor. This resulted in Youth A being taken to the\nhospital where Youth A was assessed for mental illness issues\nand sent back to the facility 3 hours later. They also reported\nYouth A was very calm at the hospital and Youth A is reported to\nhave told a supervisor (unidentified) that Youth A will continue with\nself-harming behaviors if returned to the facility. Youth A has been\non one-to-one supervision since the return from the hospital.\nAdministrator 1 and Administrator 2 reported meeting with the\n2",
    "Psychiatrist, nursing staff, and therapists of Network 180 to\ndevelop a plan to keep Youth A safe from himself. They have\nplaced mattresses on the floor so if he jumps off the bed again,\nthere is less chance of injury. Youth A is wearing a suicide vest.\nAll of these precautions have been recommended by Network 180\nstaff. They reported Youth A is allowed out of the bedroom and\ninto the program (school and other activities) as long as Youth A\npromises to not engage in self-harming behaviors. If Youth A\nengages in self-harming behaviors, Youth A is returned to his\nbedroom. Administrator 1 and Administrator 2 were\ninterviewed again face-to-face at the facility on 5/30/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. They provided a copy of the\nvideo recording and reported watching the video recording.\nNeither had any concerns with the restraint and reported\nSupervisor was present during the whole incident. Staff 1 took\ncontrol of the situation and had to readjust the hold which caused\nthem to flip over and place Youth A on the floor. Both reported\nStaff 1 is “one of the best and does things by the book”. They will\nuse Staff 1 to help train other staff because he is “just that good at\nit”. They reported Youth A is allowed normal activities during the\nday if he is not threatening self-harm but at night Youth A will\nsleep in the observation room.\nYouth A was observed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/28/2024. Youth A did not respond to “hi” and was laying on 2\nmattresses on the floor of Youth A’s room. Staff (unidentified) was\nsitting in the doorway of the room. Youth A was attempted to be\ninterviewed again face-to-face at the facility on 5/30/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth A refused to be\ninterviewed when asked.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/28/2024. He reported responding to a call for assistance on the\nSHU unit where Youth A was lodged. Upon arriving to the unit,\nStaff 1 observed Youth A in the bedroom (observation room) with\nthe door closed. Staff 1 had been told (did not identify source) that\nYouth A had placed items in front of the camera and was\nobstructing the view. Staff 1 reported opening the door to the room\nand attempting to deescalate Youth A. Staff 1 informed Youth A\nthat the bedding will be removed (self-harm process) and Youth A\ntold Staff 1 that Staff 1 can’t take the bedding. Youth A grabbed\nthe sheets and mattress. Staff 1 reported the other staff (unsure\nwho this individual was) in the room grabbed the mattress and\nStaff 1 began the standing hold of Youth A because Youth A was\nhiding items on Youth A’s person. Staff 1 attempted to place\nYouth A in a neutral floor position but because Youth A was close\n3",
    "to the bed and toilet they had to back up before Staff 1 placed\nYouth A in a neutral position on the ground. Staff 1 reported\nhaving to modify his hold and take down of Youth A because of\nthe obstacles including the toilet and bed. Staff 1 reported being\nbetween Youth A and the ground when they went to the ground\nduring the restraint. The items were removed from Youth A and\nafter Staff 1 released the hold and stood up, Youth A said “I still\nhave stuff”. Staff 1 reported Youth A had no injuries and never\ncomplained or said Youth A was hurt. Staff 1 reported having a\ngood relationship with Youth A and has been involved in several\nincidents to help deescalate Youth A and get Youth A back into\nthe program appropriately. Staff 1 reported hearing (unable to\nidentify from whom) that Staff 1 body slammed Youth A to the\nfloor but denied doing such behavior. Staff 1 identified Supervisor\nand Staff 4 present at the time of the restraint.\nSupervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nbeing present during the restraint outlined in the allegations and\nidentified Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 4, Staff 6, Staff 7, Staff 8, and\nAdministrator 3 being present. He reported Staff 3 and Staff 5\nwere monitoring the situation from the control room using video\nfeeds. He reported the restraint took place at approximately\n10am, after Youth A earned a consequence while in school. When\nYouth A got to his bedroom, Youth A began to threaten diving off\nthe bed before sticking toilet paper over the camera. Youth A then\nput toilet paper into his pants and tied his shirt around the neck at\nwhich time staff (unknown) informed Network 180 of Youth A’s\nactions. Supervisor was trying to deescalate Youth A, but Youth A\nrefused to give up his clothing which was recommended by\nNetwork 180. Supervisor reported Youth A engaged in “seizure”\nactivity by laying on the ground and holding Youth A’s breath and\nshaking. At this time, medical staff showed up and gave Youth A\noxygen. Supervisor reported being informed by Administrator 1 to\nplace Youth A in a supine neutral position when restraining to\nkeep Youth A from harming self. Throughout this time, staff\ncontinued to try and deescalate Youth A through verbal prompts.\nYouth A was restrained twice during this time with the first\nrestraint being conducted by Staff 1 and the second restraint\nbeing conducted by Staff 4. Supervisor reported Staff 1 had to\nmodify the technique used because of the small space and not\nwanting Youth A to hit the toilet or bed. Staff 1 was able to place\nYouth A in a supine neutral position once adjusting for the space.\nSupervisor reported not having any issues with the modification\nStaff 1 used to ensure Youth A was safe. The purpose of the first\nresistant to was obtain the items Youth A had in his possession.\n4",
    "Supervisor reported the second restraint was initiated to remove\nYouth A’s clothing and this involved Staff 4. Staff 4 used\nappropriate techniques to remove Youth A’s clothing and place\nYouth A in a protective suicide vest. Supervisor reported\nmechanical restraint items were used to transport Youth A to the\nhospital on a gurney. He reported Youth A never said anything\nabout any injury or that Youth A was hurt. Administrator 3 checked\nYouth A prior to the transport to the hospital.\nAdministrator 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nbeing present during the restraints outlined in the allegations. She\nreported that if staff did not hold Youth A in a neutral position,\nYouth A would get on the bed and jump off hitting Youth A’s head\ncausing Youth A to harm self. She reported no concerns with the\nrestraints and believed staff were being very gentle with Youth A.\nShe reported Staff 1 was very calm during the restraints and has a\ngreat reputation working with youth at the facility. Youth A never\ncomplained of any injury or pain during or following the 2\nrestraints. Once Youth A presented with seizure activity,\nAdministrator 3 called the doctor to get orders for Youth A to be\nadmitted to the hospital and Youth A went to the hospital in an\nambulance. She reported Youth A has been assessed and does\nnot present with the brain patterns to support a seizure. She\nbelieved Youth A will hold his breath until passing out claiming it is\na seizure. Network 180 and the facility administration has\ndeveloped a special program for Youth A which involves getting\nYouth A into the program activities as long as Youth A is not\nthreatening or attempting self-harming behaviors. This also\ninvolves having staff with good relationships with Youth A working\nwith Youth A as much as possible. Youth A is allowed to go to\nYouth A’s room if feeling frustrated so Youth A can relax and calm\ndown before behaving in a way that will result in a consequence.\nAdministrator 3 reported mattresses are to be placed on the floor\nto keep Youth A from hitting Youth A’s head against the floor\nwhen diving off the bed and Youth A is on one-to-one supervision.\nAdministrator 3 reported Youth A has stated that Youth A will\ncontinue with the self-harming attempts until death and then Youth\nA will watch the facility on the news from Heaven.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nbeing present but not involved in the restraint. He reported Staff 1\ndidn’t use the normal (taught) restraint technique when taking\nYouth A to the floor at the beginning of the restraint. He was\nunable to identify why Staff 1 would “modify” the technique and\n5",
    "believed this caused Youth A to move more towards the back wall\nof the room. He reported never hearing Youth A say anything\nabout being hurt during or after the restraint. He reported the\nrestraint was initiated after it was identified (on the radio to staff\nand unknown from who) as a safety risk because Youth A was\nusing toilet paper to cover the camera view and Youth A had a\nhistory of self-harming behaviors. Staff 2’s biggest concerns were\nthe use of mechanical restraint items when restraining Youth A.\nHe reported this began after Youth A was return from the hospital\nand increased supervision techniques were introduced. He\nreported being verbally informed by administration that the use of\nmechanical restraint technology would be used and would have\npreferred this information was presented in a written policy change\nwith “clear guidelines”.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 3 reported\nworking in central control and observing the restraint on camera.\nAfter observing Youth A being escorted back to the observation\nroom and putting wet toilet paper over the camera lens to obstruct\nviewing, Staff 3 called for floating staff to go to the observation\nroom for support. After observing Staff 1 engage in the restraint\nwhen Youth A refused to give up the toilet paper Youth A had in\nYouth A’s pants, Staff 3 reported the technique used by Staff 1\ndidn’t appear to be a “handle with care” technique. He reported\nStaff 1 had his arms over the top of Youth A’s arms which is not a\ntrained technique. Staff 3 believed the initiation of the restraint by\nStaff 1 was not done according to the Handle with Care training\nbecause Staff 1 used a “bear hug” before grabbing Youth A’s\narms. Staff 3 reported observing other restraints by Staff 1 and\nStaff 1 has always used appropriate techniques. Staff 3’s other\nconcern was the use of mechanical restraints because staff have\nnot been provided policy in writing on this change and several\nstaff (unidentified) are uncomfortable.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nbeing present when the restraint occurred. He reported working as\na floating staff and received a radio call that staff need support for\nYouth A in the observation room. When getting to the room, Staff\n4 observed Youth A making self-harming treats “I can fall\nbackwards and bust my head on the window”, and stated other\nscenarios of what Youth A could do to self-harm. He reported staff\nwere waiting for the Network 180 staff to show up because the\nNetwork 180 staff wanted Youth A placed in a suicide suit to help\navoid self-harming behaviors. Staff 4 reported Youth A took toilet\n6",
    "paper and covered the camera lens while also stuffing toilet paper\nin Youth A’s pants and under the mattress. Staff 1 initiated the\nrestraint and Staff 4 attempted to tell Staff 1 that Staff 4 was able\nto do the restraint, but Staff 1 still engaged. Staff 4 reported not\nwanting to argue in front of Youth A, so he didn’t confront Staff 1\nat the time. Staff 4 reported Supervisor was present at the time to\nobserve staff’s interactions with Youth A. Staff 4 reported Staff 1\ngrabbed Youth A’s right arm with Staff 1’s two arms but normally\nthe technique is to put an arm under the youth’s arm and turn\nwhile putting staff’s other arm under the youth’s other arm. Staff 4\ndoesn’t believe this was a taught technique to initiate a restraint.\nStaff 4 denied hearing Youth A complain of any pain and reported\nYouth A was laughing during the restraint. Staff 4 reported not\ntelling anyone of his concerns of the restraint because he doesn’t\nbelieve Staff 1 did anything with malignant intentions and the\nphysical condition of the room (space between bed and toilet) did\nnot allow Staff 1 to get behind Youth A as trained. Staff 4’s other\nconcern is the lack of a written policy on the use of mechanical\nrestraints because staff are fearful of getting in trouble if using this\ntechnology.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nworking in central control and observing the restraint of Youth A\nby Staff 1. He reported the restraint of Youth A by Staff 1, “didn’t\nlook clean”. Staff 5 reported the initiation of the restraint looked\nlike more of a “bear hug” rather than Staff 5 grabbing Youth A’s\narms as taught with the Handle with Care. He reported having no\nconcerns about Staff 1’s restraints in the past. Staff 5 reported a\nconcern of the use of mechanical restraints because there is no\nwritten policy and staff are fearful of getting into trouble. He\nreported feeling “burnt out” over the stress of trying to keep Youth\nA safe when Youth A keeps trying to self-harm.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 6 reported\narriving on the scene when Staff 1 was trying to place Youth A in a\nstanding hold and observed Staff 1 turn Youth A and place Youth\nA in a neutral position on the floor. Staff 6 believed the techniques\nused by Staff 1 were appropriate because “you just have to do the\nbest you can”. Staff 6 reported not hearing Youth A complain of\nany pain or injury.\nStaff 7 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 7\nreported being present during the restraint of Youth A by Staff 1.\n7",
    "He was working a different unit when receiving a call for support to\nYouth A’s observation room. When getting to the location, Staff 1\nhad Youth A in the restraint and placed Youth A on the floor. Staff\n7 reported the restraint was different because of the situation with\nthe toilet and bed taking up space. Staff 1 lifted Youth A up off the\nground as Youth A’s feet came off the ground and Staff 1 placed\nYouth A on the ground. Because Staff 7 had been on the job for\nonly a short time, he didn’t question the restraint techniques used\nuntil completing his training 2-days later. After completing the\nrestraint training, Staff 7 now believed the techniques used by\nStaff 1 were not appropriate. Staff 7 reported the hip thrust when\npicking up Youth A was inappropriate but understands this took\nplace so Youth A would not hit Youth A’s legs on the toilet nor hit\nYouth A’s head on the wall.\nStaff 8 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nnot being present during the restraints but was present prior and\naware the safety issues that were put into place because of Youth\nA’s threats to self-harm. When she was in the observation room of\nYouth A, Youth A was standing against the wall smiling and\nstating that Youth A was happy because Youth A was going to kill\nhimself and get the facility into trouble for Youth A’s death. After\nYouth A made a gesture of jumping off the bed, Staff 8 informed\nSupervisor that Youth A needs to be placed in the suicide vest.\nStaff 8 left the room prior to the restraints. She reported Youth A\nhas been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 with psychotic features and\nmajor depressive disorder. She reported Youth A is allowed into\nthe normal program if Youth A promises to show positive\ncooperative behaviors and follows through with this change. Youth\nA is only placed in high-risk protocol when showing self-harming\nbehaviors and then only as long as these behaviors persist.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n5/30/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth B\nreported living on the same unit (SHU) as Youth A and was\npresent with the situation began in the classroom with Youth A.\nYouth B described Youth A as talking about inappropriate things\nand not following directions from staff. Youth B reported never\nobserving staff being inappropriate with Youth A. Youth B reported\nthe program is helping and Youth B feels safe at the facility.\nVideo Review\nThe video is dated 5/21/2024 and there is no time stamp. The\nview is from above the door leading into the observation room\ntowards the back wall where the toilet is located. Within this view,\n8",
    "the bed is observed against the right back wall. Youth A is\nstanding close to the back wall, between the toilet and bed with\nYouth A’s hands clinched and held down at Youth A’s sides.\nYouth A has toilet paper in Youth A’s left hand. Supervisor and\nStaff 1 are standing to the right side and in front of Youth A as the\nvideo begins. Both Supervisor and Staff 1 back away from Youth\nA to the doorway. Supervisor and Staff 1 walk back into the room\nand Staff 1 moves to Youth A and grabs Youth A by the shoulders\nwith Youth A backing up to the back wall. Staff 6 enters the room\nfollowing Supervisor and Staff 1. Staff 4 quickly enters the room,\nmoving past Staff 2 and stands right behind Staff 1 who is\nengaged in the standing hold of Youth A who is against the back\nwall. Staff 4 attempts to grab items out of Youth A’s left hand but\nYouth A pulls his left arm away from Staff 4. Staff 2 has moved\ninto the room behind Supervisor, Staff 1, and Staff 4. Staff 1 is still\nholding Youth A from the front, when he, Youth A, and Staff 4\nbegin to walk towards the middle of the room before Staff 1 begins\nto move towards the floor, taking Youth A with him. Staff 4\nappears to get the item from Youth A’s left hand. Staff 4 backs\naway and Staff 1 holds Youth A by the shoulder and turns to his\nleft flipping Youth A while Youth A’s feet leave the ground and\nplacing Youth A on the floor between the toilet and bed with Staff\n1 above Youth A. Youth A appears to be on Youth A’s left side\nwith Staff 1 straddled above Youth A in a kneeling position.\nSupervisor moved to the left of Staff 1 and Staff 6 moves to the\nright of Staff 1. Staff 4 has left the room. Staff 6 moved to a\nkneeling position and holds Youth A’s legs. Staff 2 enters the\nroom and stands behind Staff 1 and Youth A.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nMedical Patient Note for Youth A dated 5/21/24 and authored\nby Staff 9. This document outlines medical staff’s (Staff 9)\nassessment of Youth A on 5/21/24. Youth A was assessed for\n“seizure” behaviors in Youth A’s room. Youth A’s breathing was\nwithin normal range for the movements of Youth A’s body. Youth\nA presented with O2 saturation of 99% and was attempting to hold\nYouth A’s breath before beginning to breath normally again. Youth\nA did not present with any symptoms of a seizure and Youth A’s\nbehaviors of a seizure appear to be behavioral rather than\nmedical.\nOff-site Emergency Referral ER-9.0 dated 5/21/24. This\ndocument outlines the emergency services provided for Youth A.\nIt is documented the ambulance was provided for transportation of\nYouth A to the Trinity Health emergency room. The reason for this\nreferral is staff’s observation of Youth A on the SHU unit. Youth A\n9",
    "was presenting with self-convulsing body only and limbs were not\nnoted to be shaking, respirations were in normal range for Youth\nA’s body movements, and Youth A had a O2 saturation of 99%.\nYouth A attempted to hyperventilate but then slowed breathing to\nnormal breathing pattern. Youth A’s eyes reacted to his eyes\nbeing opened. It is documented that this is observed as behavioral\nrather than medical.\nIncident 179109 for Youth A dated 5/21/24 authored by Staff 8.\nThis document outlines the observation of Youth A by Staff 8\nwhen she entered the observation room after Youth A had\nbecome dysregulated. This matches the report provided in the\ninterview of Staff 8.\nIncident 179110 for Youth A dated 5/21/24 authored by\nseveral staff.\n• Primary authored by Staff 10. This narrative outlines the\nincident in the classroom that led to Youth A going to the\nobservation room for violation and aggressive behaviors.\nThis begins and ends in the classroom where Youth A is\ndocumented as throwing the laptop at a large screen\ntelevision.\n• Supplemental authored by Staff 1. This narrative is\nconsistent with what was reported by Staff 1 during his\ninterview. Staff 1 described the restraint as a Primary\nRestraint Technique (PRT) in response to Youth A refusing\nthe directions given by Supervisor over removing all items\nfrom the room.\n• Supplemental authored by Staff 2. This narrative is\nconsistent with what was reported by Staff 2 during his\ninterview. Staff 2 described the restraint as Staff 1 placing\nYouth A in a PRT before placing Youth A in a “neutral\nposition”.\n• Supplemental authored by Staff 6. This narrative is\nconsistent with what was reported by Staff 6 during his\ninterview. Staff 6 documents Staff 1 placing Youth A on the\nfloor in a neutral position as a result of Youth A refusing to\ncomply with the directions provided by Supervisor.\n• Supplemental authored by Supervisor. This narrative\ndocuments that Youth A was placed in a safety vest due to\nthreats and attempts at self-harm.\n• Second Supplemental authored by Supervisor. This\nnarrative outlines the actions taken by Youth A prior to the\nrestraint with Staff 1. It is documented that Supervisor\n10",
    "asked several times that Youth A provide the paper hidden\non Youth A’s person before Supervisor authorized the\nrestraint in an effort to retrieve the paper which was\nretrieved during the restraint by Staff 1. The type of\nrestraint or further description was not identified in this\nnarrative. Further narrative outlines the second restraint to\nremove Youth A’s clothing and placed in a safety vest.\nFinally, it is documented the process of Youth A’s order for\nan assessment at the emergency room.\n• Supplemental authored by Staff 7. This narrative is\nconsistent with was reported by Staff 7 during his interview.\nStaff 7 described the restraint as Youth A being placed in a\nPRT (unknown who the staff were) and Staff 1 and Staff 4\nhaving Youth A in a neutral position.\nDetention Procedures Manual – Resident Management 600.16\ndated 8/24/2016. This document outlines the use of\nphysical/mechanical restraint by staff with youth in the facility.\nStaff are to use the approved Handle with Care behavior\nmanagement system when applying behavior management and all\nstaff are to be trained on the appropriate techniques of this\nprocess.\nHandle with Care Behavior Management System physical\nintervention manual for participants dated 2012. This manual\noutlines the different strategies when engaging in a physical\nintervention. It is documented that the “Solo Takedown” which\nStaff 1 engaged in should occur with the staff standing behind the\nyouth locking the staff’s arms under the youth’s arms with the\nstaff’s hands placed on the upper back of the youth. Staff are to\nbe standing behind the youth before beginning the “takedown”.\nThe next action by staff is described as taking a long step back\nlowering staff’s center of gravity, drawing the youth off balance.\nStaff’s palms are against the youth’s back to support the youth’s\nweight. Staff are then to lower their knee to the floor, slowly\nstaging the youth’s descent to a sitting position before staff drops\ntheir other knee to the floor. This final action by staff will bring the\nyouth to a sitting position on the floor. Staff are then to “pivot their\nknee” and gently turn the youth 180 degrees to the neutral\nposition.\nStaff 1’s personnel file: Documentation indicates Staff 1 was\nhired in 8/8/2016 and there is no disciplinary action documents in\nthe file. Documentation in the file indicates Staff 1 completed\nbehavior management refresher (HWC 4 hours) on 10/17/23. Staff\n1 is current on all training requirements.\n11",
    "Analysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per video review,\nStaff1 did not utilize an approved restraint technique when he bear\nhugged Youth A, lifting Youth A off the ground and then bringing\nYouth A to the ground. Several staff interviewed reported the\ntechnique used by Staff 1 was not appropriate and Staff 1\nadmitted during the interview that he “modified” the technique.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered in regard to providing written\npolicies and procedures to staff using the approved mechanical\nrestraint equipment when needed with Youth A. Staff presented as\nfearful of incurring consequences when using the mechanical\nrestraint equipment with Youth A and also fearful of Youth A\nfollowing through with the treats to self-harm.\nTechnical assistance was also offered in regard to staff’s fear of\nproviding enough care to keep Youth A from self-harming as\nthreatened by Youth A. It was recommended that the\nadministration provide training in dealing with mental health issues\nthat Youth A presents and allowing staff to have a voice to share\ntheir concerns.\nConclusion REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2023C0000413 dated 4/19/23, CAP approved 6/12/23\n12",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
