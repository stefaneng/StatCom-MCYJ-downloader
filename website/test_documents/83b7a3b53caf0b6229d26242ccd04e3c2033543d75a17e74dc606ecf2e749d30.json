    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Compliance with the child protection law\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12214\nSection • (1) An agency shall comply with the child protection law,\nDescription 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency failed to report an incident of suspected\nabuse/neglect that occurred while a child had an unsupervised\nvisit with a parent.\nInvestigation On 4/23/24 Complainant reported an allegation that someone\ninserted a rock into Youth A’s bottom. This reportedly occurred on\n4/7/24 while Youth A was visiting his mother. The agency failed to\nreport this allegation to Centralized Intake until 4/19/24.\nInterviews:\nChief Administrator was contacted via email on 4/24/24. Chief\nAdministrator did not have any direct knowledge of the incident\nand provided contact information for involved staff. Chief\nAdministrator did not have any additional questions.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via Teams on 4/26/24.\nFoster Care Worker reported she was informed of the concern by\nFoster Parent on 4/7/24. Foster Parent called that evening and\nreported Youth A said a “rock bug went into his bottom”. Foster\nParent reported Youth A did not provide any other information, but\nshe observed that his bottom was itchy. Foster Care Worker\ninstructed Foster Parent to take Youth A to the doctor to\ndetermine if he was bitten by a bug, or if something else was\ncausing the itch.\nFoster Care Worker visited Youth A the following day to attempt to\ngather additional information. When asked for more information,\nYouth A answered that he did not know what a “rock bug” was, or\nhow it got there. Youth A could not describe the rock bug and did\nnot report that anyone touched him or put anything in his body.\nYouth A was seen by Pediatrician on 4/8/24. Pediatrician did not\nidentify any concerns from the physical exam. As Youth A denied\nknowing what a rock bug was and did not report anyone touched\nhim, Foster Care Worker did not believe there was alleged abuse\nto report. Foster Care Worker stated she did not have any other\n2",
    "information that would cause her to suspect abuse occurred while\nYouth A visited his mother. In addition, Foster Parent reported to\nFoster Care Worker that Youth A had been itching his bottom for\nseveral days, prior to the visit with his mother. The discomfort with\nhis bottom was not something new from the visit.\nFoster Care Worker was unsure of where the information came\nfrom that was later reported to DHHS, regarding someone putting\na rock in Youth A’s behind. Foster Care Worker stated Youth A\nnever made that statement to her.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via Teams on 4/29/24.\nProgram Manager stated Foster Parent called the agency on-call\nphone on 4/7/24 to report a concern about Youth A. Foster Parent\nwas unable to reach someone via the on-call phone and contacted\nFoster Care Supervisor directly to report the concern. Foster Care\nSupervisor notified Foster Care Worker, who then contacted\nFoster Parent to discuss next steps. Program Manager did not\ndirectly speak with Foster Parent. After the call, Foster Care\nWorker reached out to Foster Parent to gather additional\ninformation. Foster Care Worker informed Program Manager that\nYouth A had itching and soreness in his bottom. A medical\nappointment was scheduled to determine what was causing the\nproblem. The medical evaluation was completed on 4/8/24 and did\nnot note any concerns.\nOn 4/19/24 Program Manager was informed an investigation had\nbeen initiated by DHHS regarding Youth A’s Mother. The DHHS\nintake stated “a rock was inserted” in Youth A’s bottom. Program\nManager spoke with Foster Care Worker to gather additional\ninformation. The Foster Care Worker stated the information she\nreceived from Foster Parent and Youth A, did not match the\nDHHS intake. Although, the information differed from the DHHS\nintake, Program Manager decided to call Centralized Intake to\nmake a report.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed via Teams on\n4/29/24. Foster Care Supervisor reported that she received a call\nfrom Foster Parent after Youth A returned to the home from\nvisiting his mother on 4/7/24. Per Foster Parent, when Youth A\nwas asked to take a bath, he refused, and indicated his bottom\nhurt. Foster Parent reported Youth A said a “rock bug went in his\nbehind”. Youth A did not state anyone put it there and did not\nstate when it happened. Foster Parent could not elaborate as\nYouth A did not provide any further information. Per Foster Parent,\nYouth A was scratching and digging at his bottom for a few days\nprior to the visit with his mother. Youth A took an oatmeal bath to\nalleviate the itching and Foster Parent scheduled an appointment\n3",
    "with his doctor. Youth A saw Pediatrician the following day, 4/8/24.\nPediatrician did not find anything of concern.\nFoster Care Supervisor spoke with Youth A’s Mother and asked if\nshe was aware of any reason why Youth A was itching his bottom.\nYouth A’s Mother stated Youth A has very dry skin and itches at\ntimes. Youth A had an ointment that was used at home, but it was\ncurrently out. A follow-up call occurred with Foster Parent, where it\nwas determined they would change the laundry detergent and\naddress the dry skin.\nA few days later, Foster Care Supervisor became aware of the\nDHHS investigation where the allegation stated someone “put a\nrock in” Youth A’s bottom. Foster Care Supervisor stated she was\nnot sure where that information came from as, to her knowledge,\nYouth A never said someone put a rock in his bottom. Youth A\nnever expressed anyone touched him or put anything near or in\nhis body. Youth A did not name any people or identify a time when\nanything was put in his bottom.\nTherapist was interviewed by phone on 5/21/24. Therapist\nconfirmed Youth A as a client. Therapist stated she was informed\nby Foster Parent that Youth A said a hard rock was “put in” his\nbottom. Therapist attempted to discuss this with Youth A.\nHowever, Youth A did not provide any additional information.\nFoster Parent was interviewed by phone on 5/24/24. Foster\nParent was asked to clarify what Youth A specifically said about\nhis bottom. Foster Parent reported Youth A said it was a “rock\nbug” not a rock. When Foster Parent asked questions to\nunderstand what Youth A meant, Youth A guessed that someone\nmust have put a rock bug in his bottom while he was sleeping.\nYouth A described the rock bug as being hard and brown. Foster\nParent stated with Youth A only being 5 years old, she was unsure\nif he was referring to a hard piece of feces, or something else.\nYouth A never indicated his mother did anything and did not\nidentify any other person that was present. Youth A did not say\nwhen this occurred. Youth A did not say what happened to the\n“rock bug”. Youth A answered most clarifying questions with “I\ndon’t know”.\nFoster Parent contacted the agency on 4/7/24 and reported Youth\nA said a “rock bug went in his butt”. Foster Parent was unclear\nabout what that meant but wanted to notify the agency. As she\ndiscussed with Foster Care Worker on the phone, she mentioned\nthat Youth A had some itching in his bottom over the past few\ndays, prior to visiting his mother. Foster Care Worker advised\nFoster Parent to take Youth A to the doctor to make sure there\nwasn’t a bug bit or other skin condition that needed to be treated.\n4",
    "Foster Parent took Youth A to Pediatrician to be examined on\n4/8/24; they did not find anything of concern.\nFoster Parent added that Youth A’s mother reported the child had\na history of being itchy at times due to dry skin. Foster Parent\nbathed Youth A in an oatmeal bath and changed the brand of\nlaundry detergent. There have been no further issues with Youth\nA itching or mention of “rock bugs”.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Human Resources file for Foster Care Worker- There was\nno disciplinary action on file for this staff regarding the Child\nProtection Law.\n• Case Contacts-\no 4/7/24 Foster Care Supervisor received a phone call\nfrom Foster Parent. Foster Parent reported Youth A\nsaid a “rock bug” went in his butt. However, he did\nnot provide any clarification.\no 4/8/24 Foster Care Worker spoke with Foster\nParent. Youth A was itching his bottom and stated a\n“rock bug got inside”.\no 4/8/24 Foster Care Supervisor called Youth A’s\nMother and she did not know what a rock bug was.\nShe reported Youth A had been itching, but she did\nnot know if it was a bug bite or dry skin.\no 4/19/24 Foster Care Worker informed of DHHS\ninvestigation. Foster Care Worker contacted Youth\nA’s Mother and Foster Parent to discuss the safety\nplan.\no 4/22/24 Foster Care Worker spoke with Youth A.\nYouth A stated he did not know what a rock bug\nwas. Youth A did not provide any additional\ninformation.\n• Letter from Pediatrician dated 4/11/24- Youth A was seen\nin the office on 4/8/24 with Foster Parent. Youth A was\nevaluated for pain in the buttocks. No medication or labs\nwere ordered. No concerns were noted.\n• Incident Report completed by Foster Care Worker on\n4/23/24- The incident report was consistent with the case\ncontact in MiSACWIS.\n• Incident Report completed by Foster Care Supervisor on\n4/22/24- The incident report was consistent with the\ninformation provided in the interview on 4/29/24.\n• DHHS intake dated 4/18/24. DHHS Worker contacted\nFoster Parent. Foster Parent reported Youth A said while\nhe was asleep at his mother’s home “a rock bug got\n5",
    "pushed up his butt”. Youth A reported that only his mother\nwas in the home when he visited.\n• DHHS case contact on 4/22/24- During an interview Youth\nA reported he stayed at his mother’s home overnight and\nslept in his own bed, but then went into his mother’s\nbedroom and watched television. Youth A was asked about\nthe rock bug. Youth A denied knowing what a rock bug was\nand stated he never said those words.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as interviews with Foster\nParent and agency staff concluded the agency did not suspect\nabuse when they initially received information from Foster Parent\non 4/7/24. Therefore, a report was not made to centralized intake.\nAll interviews determined Foster Parent initially reported that\nYouth A said a “rock bug” went in his bottom. This is different from\nthe third-hand information reported to DHHS on 4/18/24 that\nstated “someone inserted a rock” in Youth A's bottom while visiting\nhis mother.\nWhen agency staff initially attempted to gain clarification about the\n“rock bug”, Youth A could not explain what it was and did not\nindicate involvement by anyone else. No one observed a rock or\nrock bug, and Pediatrician did not observe any physical signs that\nwould have indicated possible abuse. In addition, Foster Parent\nand Youth A’s Mother reported Youth A was itching his behind for\nseveral days prior to visiting his mother, indicating the itching\nbehavior was not caused by something that occurred during the\nvisit.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
