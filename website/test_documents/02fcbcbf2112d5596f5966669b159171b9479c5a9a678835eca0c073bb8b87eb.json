    "summary": "A Michigan child placing agency failed to notify a biological parent of her child's urgent medical visit and a scheduled dental appointment, violating rules requiring parental involvement in healthcare decisions. The failures stemmed from outdated contact information in the state database and a lack of timely communication from both the foster parent and the agency's caseworker. The investigation concluded the agency is ultimately responsible for ensuring proper notification, establishing a clear violation of policy.",

    "level": "severe",
    "justification": "The report substantiates that the biological parent was not informed or included in medical/dental treatment and decision-making for their child, including failure to notify the parent about a visit to Urgent Care and a scheduled dental appointment. This constitutes a medical and mental health concern due to missed medical care, unmet treatment needs, and lack of parental involvement in critical health decisions, aligning with the 'severe' category for medical and mental health concerns."
