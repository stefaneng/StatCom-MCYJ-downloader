DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nMuskegon County Juvenile Transition Center was formerly licensed as a Child\nCaring Institution (CCI), CE610366886. Muskegon Juvenile Transition Center\n(MJTC) requested to close their CCI license and open under a Court Operated\nFacility as the administrative authority was transferred from the Muskegon County\nBoard of Commissioners to the Muskegon County Family Court. This is 32 bed,\nsecure juvenile detention facility built in 2014. It is divided into two wings (A & B)\neach wing consisting of two pods for a total of four pods – each able to\naccommodate eight youth. Each pod consists of two single rooms and three double\nrooms. Each room has an attached bathroom with locked door. Each of the pods is\nable to accommodate a co-ed population, as census varies. Each room has the\nability to provide seclusion for one youth and is audio and video monitored.\nThe facility also has an intake and mental health assessment area, medical/dental\narea, a family services and visitation area, three classrooms and a computer lab, a\ngymnasium, a courtyard and outdoor recreation area, and two flexible living areas\nthat confine up to sixteen residents to a four room daytime living area. The facility\nhas a warming kitchen. Food is prepared off site and transported to the facility in\nfood warmers. Currently the facility contracts with Canteen Food Service. There is a\nlaundry area as well.\nThere is good visibility between areas that allows staff to view not only their own pod\ngroup, but to observe other pod groups to insure orderly operation throughout the\nfacility. All doors in the facility are electronic, with staff carrying key fobs to open\ndoors. The four exterior doors in the facility are not controlled by these fobs. A shift\nsupervisor area allows all pods to be observed simultaneously via cameras. Exterior\ndoors are controlled by the shift supervisor.\n2",
    "An Environmental Health Inspection on 12/09/2016 resulted in an “A” rating, as did\nthe Fire Safety Inspection conducted on 12/22/2016.\nB. Program Description\nMJTC Mission Statement is “The Muskegon County Juvenile Transition Center\nprovides safety and security in a learning and caring environment”. The facility\nserves youth ages 10-17 both male and female. The facility will address any\ntransgender youth based on the youth’s preference. The facility has many\ncommunity partners that help provide a continuum of care for youth while residing at\nthe facility and upon discharge including HealthWest (CMH), Muskegon Family Care\n(for medical services), and Muskegon Area Intermediate School District.\nAccording to their Policy and Procedure Manual the facility programming is as\nfollows:\nThe Muskegon County Juvenile Transition Center is a secure co-educational\nfacility which functions under the auspices of the Muskegon County Family Court.\nYouth are referred to the Juvenile Transition Center by Family Court or one of its\ndesignates. Only youth who are accused of or adjudicated for law violations are\nplaced in the facility. The facility assures that all legal rights of the youth are\nprotected while in custody and that confined youth live free from fear of assault or\nintimidation by staff or other juveniles. Juvenile Transition Center personnel are\nresponsible for the care, guidance, and control of youth placed in their custody.\nYouth are released only upon authorization of the Family Court or its designates.\nThe Muskegon County Juvenile Transition Center provides a short-term,\nphysically restrictive, safe, and humane environment for incarcerated youth. The\nMuskegon County Juvenile Transition Center offers an individualized education\nprogram that is qualified to meet special educational needs. All youth are\nrequired to participate in the school program. Residents receive three nutritionally\nbalanced meals, an afternoon, and evening snack each day. The Juvenile\nTransition Center provides a variety of recreational and physical activities which\nare available to each resident. There is strong emphasis on individual and\ncommunal hygiene and youth are required to shower daily, change clothing and\nbedding often, and maintain their rooms in a clean and healthy manner.\nThe Juvenile Transition Center program components are designed to meet each\nindividual youth’s nutritional, emotional, spiritual, educational, recreational, and\nphysical needs.\nGuided Group Interaction:\nGuided Group Interaction uses this proactive approach in dealing with negative\nbehaviors. Residents are at the center of the program. They are the ones\nresponsible for dispensing advice, correction, and praise. This does not mean\nthat staff members give up complete control to the residents and dismiss\n3",
    "expectations, rules, and regulations. There are, and always will be, established\nexpectations and measures of discipline. Discipline will always be implemented\nby staff. However, the program focuses on problem solving rather than problem\ncontrol. The underlying theory being that adolescents are naturally in an\noppositional phase of development, and thereby rejecting the advice and counsel\nof adults in favor of that of their peers. In GGI, residents should perceive their\npeer group as their primary source of help and support.\nThe staff’s most important role with regard to the program is to encourage, teach,\nand guide the residents to help their peers in a caring and respectful manner. The\nstaff member role is NOT to control the residents but to teach the residents to\ncontrol themselves. When given proper direction, youth are not only willing to\nhelp themselves, but also willing to help others. The group will function only as\nwell as the staff members develop them. As with individual growth and\ndevelopment, the groups need firmly and sensitively set limits, encouragement,\nand permission to make mistakes. Problems must be viewed as opportunities for\nchange.\nResponding to Negative Behavior:\nResidents are expected to “give help” in an appropriate manner when they\nobserve their peers behaving in a way that is against expectations. What does\n“giving help” mean and what does it look like?\n Informal means of reminding or “cueing” a resident that their behavior is not in\nline with program and facility expectations\n Informal means of offering suggestions to a resident to control his/her behavior\n(time out, deep breathing, etc.)\n Must be done in a positive, helpful manner\n Should be done by residents!\n If residents are not taking responsibility for helping their peers, they may need\nprompting – staff should only give help when they are the only one to witness\nthe behavior or the group is not functioning in a manner where they are being\nhelpful to each other.\nFor the most part, this informal means of reminding is sufficient to correct the\nproblem, at least temporarily. Occasionally, a resident doesn’t respond to help,\nthe behavior may continue or repeat even after several helps, or the behavior may\nwarrant something stronger than a help. It is in such instances that the formal\nproblem-solving process, Group Assistance, is used.\nGroup Assistance:\nThe Group Assistance (GA) process is the formal problem solving process used in\nGuided Group Interaction (GGI). When a resident is not following expectations, a\ngroup member or staff should offer them help by reminding them of expectations.\nIf a resident has not responded to help offered, a Group Assistance should be\ncalled.\nWhat is the purpose of a Group Assistance?\n4",
    " Help residents understand and solve problem behavior\n Teach residents to take responsibility for their own actions\n Eliminate inappropriate behavior\n Build group cohesiveness\n Problem solve within the group\n Positively deal with behaviors immediately\n Behavior management\n Give residents opportunity to express themselves\n Give staff opportunity to show care and concern\n Help build staff trust and rapport with residents\n Opportunity to work on communication skills\n Encourage problem solving rather than problem control\nA resident who has a GA called for him/her and works the GA positively, taking\nresponsibility for his/her behavior and coming up with a viable resolution, will be\nconsidered to have “resolved” the GA – with no resulting consequence. If not, the\nGA will be “unresolved”, and will result in a consequence, the severity of which is\nbased on the seriousness of the infraction as well as other considerations. In\ntheory and practice, the residents and staff must see the GA as a helping process,\nand not as a punishment or a means of deciding punishment, or the process\nbreaks down. For this reason, one of the Youth Specialist’s main tasks is to\nconstantly teach and encourage the residents in the proper application of the\nprocess. Teens being teens, there will naturally be many GAs. Ideally, the vast\nmajority of them will be resolved, as individual residents gain more insight not only\ninto the process, but also into their own behaviors.\nFormal Group:\nFormal group is held daily. It is a formal group setting where residents are to\ndiscuss individual as well as group problems and successes. It is a time for the\ngroup to discuss and resolve their issues. Residents are expected to assist each\nother in problem solving and help each other understand the program. Care,\nconcern, and respect should always be practiced during this time. It is also a time\nfor residents to select a daily group goal and individual goals. Formal group is a\nplace where residents can express themselves appropriately and contribute to a\npositive and safe group experience. Expectations for Formal Group are:\n Residents will recognize the group issues as well as their own\n Group members are expected to give and receive feedback in a caring and\nrespectful way\n Goals should be specific, meaningful, and related to program issues\n Residents are expected to participate and stay focused during this time\n Residents are expected to help solve individual as well as group problems\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe agency is in compliance with all rules and statutes.\n5",
