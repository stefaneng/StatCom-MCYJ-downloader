The Youth went to a\nhospital emergency room in New York on 10/29/21, as he was not feeling well. The\nYouth did not have any injuries. The Youth reported to the hospital that he was\nvisiting his uncle, however that information could not be verified. The hospital\ndetermined the Youth was from Michigan and had been AWOL for approximately 10\ndays. Law Enforcement was called to the hospital and provided supervision to the\nyouth. The foster care worker was contacted and made arrangements to fly to New\nYork to escort the Youth back to Michigan.\n2",
    "A follow-up phone call to the source was attempted on 11/1/21. However, they were\nunavailable.\nChief Administrator(CA)\nOn 11/1/21 the CA was contacted and notified of the allegations. The CA provided\ncontact information for the foster care worker and supervisor.\nCase file review\nOn 11/1/21 the Youth’s case file was reviewed in MiSACWIS. The Youth was placed\nin an apartment as an Independent Living placement on 7/6/21 as an\nUnaccompanied Refugee Minor (URM). Home visits and phone contact occurred\nmonthly between the Youth and the Foster Care Worker (CM) through September as\nrequired. October contacts were not entered at the time of the file review. In addition,\nit was noted that some contacts were entered into MiSACWIS outside of the\ntimeframe required by the MDHHS contract.\n 7/16/21 FCW and youth texted throughout the week.\n 7/16/21 FCW and youth texted throughout the week regarding food card.\n 7/20/21 (entered 8/26/21) FCW was able to visit the youth’s home.\n 8/02/21 (entered 8/16/21) Youth was picked up for court by FCW.\n 8/14/21 FCW and youth have been communicating via text message.\n 8/16/21 FCW met with youth to drop of check.\n 8/24/21 FTM with youth\n 8/24/21 (entered 10/5/21) FCW went to youth’s new placement.\n 9/16/21 Youth contacted FCW about check.\n 9/19/21 Contacted Youth via WhatsApp about school.

These visits have\nnow been entered into MiSACWIS. The PM reported the attempted visit on 10/29/21\nwas due to the FCW planning to take the Youth for a dental appointment. The FCW\nhad confirmed by text on 10/26/21 that she would pick the Youth up on 10/29/21.\nThe FCW arrived at the apartment and the Youth was not present. The FCW\nattempted to text the youth, but he did not answer. The PM confirmed the Youth is\nnot living in staff supported IL housing. The Youth lives on his own, with a peer.\nThe PM was informed that several face-to-face contacts in MiSACWIS appear to\nhave been entered late. The PM reported to be aware of this issue and stated the\nagency is addressing it. The PM explained they have two staff on maternity leave,\nwhich has caused remaining staff to cover their workloads. Staff have tried to be on\ntop of it, but timely contact entry continues to be something they have difficulty with.\n3",
    "Foster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 11/3/21 a phone interview occurred with the FCW. The FCW reported receiving\nthe case in August 2021. The FCW stated that home visits have been completed\nmonthly as required, in addition to frequent texts and phone calls. Some contacts\nwere entered late, but everything is now up to date in MiSACWIS.\nThe FCW reported texting with the Youth on 10/26/21. At that time, the Youth asked\nif he could travel to New York. The FCW checked with her supervisor and told the\nYouth he would need to provide an address and the name of the person he would be\nvisiting, before going. The Youth seemed to understand and provided some\ninformation. The worker told the Youth that approval would be needed before\ntraveling. The Youth never responded. Therefore, the FCW never knew the Youth\nleft. The FCW reported she became aware the Youth was in New York on 10/29/21.\nThe Youth later reported that he arrived in New York on 10/25/21.\nMiSACWIS review\nOn 11/4/21 newly entered contacts in MiSACWIS were reviewed and the following\nwas noted:\n 10/08/21 (entered 11/2/21) home visit with the Youth\n 10/26/21 Text with youth\n 10/29/21 Attempted announced HV- Youth was not present.\n 10/29/21 Received a phone call that the Youth was in a hospital in New York.\n 11/01/21 FCW visited youth’s residence for a home visit.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12505 Supervision.\n(2) An agency shall provide the following minimum\nsupervision:\n(a) Face-to-face contact between the social service\nworker and the youth in independent living at least once\neach month at a youth's place of residence.\nANALYSIS: Case contacts were reviewed and found the foster care case\nworker made monthly contacts as required. As this is an\nindependent living youth, placed in an apartment that is not staff\nsupervised, there is no violation found regarding the youth being\nabsent from the placement and the worker being unaware.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n4",
    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nA review of MiSACWIS case contacts determined some face-to-face contacts were\nnot entered within the required timeframe.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06H Case Contacts\nPage 19\nThe caseworker must enter the required face-to-face contacts\nlisted below in MISACWIS within five business days of the\ncontact. This includes attempted and missed face-to-face\ncontacts.\nANALYSIS: A violation was found due to case contacts being entered into\nMiSACWIS outside of the required timeframe.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n10/14/2019 INTERIM, CAP approved 10/30/2019.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\n_ ________________November 8, 2021____________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 9, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
