They are her\ngranddaughter (Child 4) whom she is in the process of adopting and three foster\nchildren. Two of the foster children, Child 1(age 7) and Child 2(age 4) are siblings.\n3",
    "Both children have been placed in her foster home since 2/19/2020. Child 1 and\nChild 2’s sister, Child 3 is placed in another foster home due to Child 3’s special\nneeds. Foster Parent 1 reported making special efforts to maintain sibling contacts.\nShe made a pack with Child 3’s foster parent, Foster Parent 2 to have such contacts\nand she cared for Child 3 during times Child 3’s foster parent had to work in April\n2020. Foster Parent 1 said she applied for a group home license in March 2020\nbecause these children’s birth mother wanted her to try to get Child 3 placed within\nher (Foster Parent 1’s) foster home. Foster Parent 1 said, she turned in all the\nrequired paperwork and the agency denied her. The agency said she didn’t have an\nadequate vehicle with a third-row seat to accommodate and transport all the\nchildren. She said because of that she purchased a larger vehicle. She also\nobtained help via a nurse. She said she turned in paperwork again for group home\nlicensure and the agency denied her. She insisted she completed an application for\na group home license more than once. She did not believe the denial went through\nthe state department. The agency denied her internally. She said Ennis denied her\napplication by way of Licensing Worker D sending her a long text message.\nLicensing Worker D said the agency thought she would be taking on too much.\nFoster Parent 1 reported that was not true. She said she had all the children\nservices in place.\nShe said the agency had a family team meeting in March and April to talk about the\nchildren, their placement plans and did not invite her. They told her they will not\nlicense her. Ennis never acted on her foster group home application. Additionally, to\nprevent her efforts to obtain placement of Child 3, the agency tried to intervene with\nChild 4’s adoption being expedited so that she could not free up a placement bed for\nChild 3. They also open a special investigation on her, alleging she had contacted\nthe birth parent about them allowing her to get guardianship of the children, which\nwas not true. She believes this was another agency effort to delay her adoption\nprogress, her opening up a bed in her home Foster Parent 1 acknowledged the\nagency did move forward with obtaining consent for Child 4’s adoption.\nOn 10/27/2020 I spoke with Chief Administrator A and Administrator B face-to face\nvia a Team’s meeting. Chief Administrator A advised he had a telephone\nconversation with Foster Parent 1 about her interest and the agency explored it, but\nFoster Parent 1 never submitted a group home license application to Ennis. He and\nAdministrator B both reported they would have acted on such an application. Both\nadministrators acknowledged there were/are concerns related to all three siblings\nbeing placed with Foster Parent 1 but that would not have caused them to have not\nacted on a submitted application. They would have and if warranted, based on\nconcerns, would have not recommended the license change.\nAdministrator B reported being advised by the department that a group home license\nwas not necessarily required, and what impact a denial could have on a current\nlicense. The agency was advised a variance to the foster home’s license could\nachieve the same results for increasing the foster home’s licensing capacity if\nwarranted. Administrator B reported this information, as well as the agency’s\n4",
    "concerns were discussed with Foster Parent 1; and Foster Parent 1 said no to the\nvariance.\nBoth administrators reported discussing the agency’s concerns with Foster Parent 1\nafter she voiced an interest in placement of Child 3. They advised Foster Parent 1\nthey could not recommend placement of Child 3 into her home, for all three siblings\nto be permanently placed in the home given the level of Child 3’s needs, and Foster\nParent 1’s level of responsibilities with the other children in her care. They\ndenied slowing down Foster Parent 1’s adoption of her granddaughter (Child 4) or\ngenerating a special evaluation to slow anything down or create a problem for Foster\nParent 1. Chief Administrator A advised the adoption flow was impacted by the\nspecial evaluation which came up and had to be explored, and with information\nprovided to MCI (Michigan Children’s Institute). He reported expediency of Child 4’s\nadoption/consent was not a delay by Ennis but was impacted due to Foster Parent\n1’s age. Departmental Policy mandates that an adoption consent cannot be\nexpedited if the applicant is over 60, as is the case for Foster Parent 1. None of\nthose matters outlined were delays initiated by Ennis. Nor was the special\nevaluation allegation, which Administrator B advised was reported to the agency.\nThe allegations that Foster Parent 1 contacted the birth parents about getting or\ngranting guardianship of the siblings to her, came from the outside and the matter\nwarranted investigation. Administrator B questioned whether Foster Parent 1 may\nhave gotten confused about matters. She reported, Foster Parent 1 will at times,\nwhen speaking with different people, tell them different things about the same\nmatter. Or Foster Parent 1 may distort what she reported. Foster Parent 1 once told\nsomeone the agency sent out a whole file on her when the agency had not.\nGAL E and Therapist F were interviewed separately by me via telephone on\n11/5/2020. Both reported Foster Parent 1 reported either that Ennis mislead her\nabout getting a group home license or that she was getting a group home license.\nGAL E said Foster Parent 1 knew the plan for the siblings was to get them all\ntogether. GAL E said Foster Parent 1 reported Foster Parent 1 was going to get her\ngranddaughter adopted to free up a space in her home, for Child 3; but GAL E knew\nno other specifics. She nor Therapist F knew whether Foster Parent 1 had applied for\na group home license.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)C was interviewed by me via telephone on 11/5/2020.\nFCW C only knew that a group home license was explored. Foster Parent 1 said, she\nwas going to look into getting a group home license, would talk with Licensing Worker\nD about it. Foster Parent 1 nor Licensing Worker D never specifically told FCW C\nthat Foster Parent 1 submitted a group home license application.\nI interviewed Licensing Worker D and Licensing Supervisor G on 11/10/2020 via a\nTeam’s meeting while I was on-site at the agency and they were at other locations.\nBoth basically corroborated the information as reported by Chief Administrator A and\nAdministrator B related to the goal for the children at placement with Foster Parent 1\nand non-submission of a group home application.\n5",
    "Licensing Worker D acknowledged there were at least two prior discussions with\nFoster Parent 1 about a group home licensing. One in March 2020 that came from\nthe foster care worker and another in July 2020 during the time of Foster Parent 1’s\nannual foster home inspection During the latter discussion Licensing Worker D\nexplained the process and Foster Parent 1 seemed to understand it and the impact\ncaring for another child would have on her and the family. At that time Foster Parent\n1 seemed okay with her license remaining as it was. She talked about her stressors\nand challenges, of caring for the children. Foster Parent 1 did not ask to change her\nlicense at that time or to increase her placement.\nLicensing Worker D and Licensing Supervisor G denied Foster Parent 1 submitting\nany paperwork for a group home license once, let along two or three times. Licensing\nSupervisor G said Foster Parent 1 may have gotten confused with paperwork she\nsubmitted for adoption. Additionally, that Foster Parent 1 has reported incorrect\ninformation. Foster Parent 1 once said she submitted paperwork via FCW C to\ntransfer her license. When FCW C was asked about it, FCW C reported Foster\nParent 1 had not.\nReviewed:\nMISACWIS case file documents and the agency’s physical file for Foster Parent 1:\n Neither records showed documentation of an application for a group home\nlicense, which would be for five to six children.\n The last application dated 4/19/2019 was for a foster family home license for\none to four children.\n MISACWIS showed a social work contact dated 9/11/2020 by Licensing\nWorker D indicating a telephone contacted to Foster Parent 1 regarding her\nwanting to increase her license to care for the sister of the two children already\nplaced in her home. During that conversation Foster Parent 1 reported an\ninterest in pursuing a license change to accept placement of the additional\nchild. Foster parent 1 reported her adoption was processing and she\nanticipated having the adoption completed by the second week of October. If\nthat was accurate, she reported being okay with waiting until the adoption was\ncompleted to make any placement changes.\n No documentation showing Foster Parent 1 had submitted an application for a\nfoster family group home.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR400.12308 Application submission\n(1) An agency shall act on a completed and signed\napplication. `\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: The evidence does not support the allegations. There is no\nevidence showing Foster Parent 1 submitted an application or\npaperwork for a foster family group home; or that the agency\nfailed to act on such.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency would not work with the foster parent on maintaining the children placed\nin her foster home. The agency also gave false information related the children’s’\ntherapist’s recommendation pertaining to placements for the siblings.\nINVESTIGATION:\nFoster Parent 1 reported the children’s Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) got involved and\nhad Ennis to remove Child 3 from Foster Parent 2’s home. Foster Parent 1 said\nChild 3 was moved abruptly because school and optically needs were not been\nacted on by Child 3’s foster parent. Then Ennis sent her(Foster Parent 1) a letter\nadvising her they were going to remove Child 1 and Child 2 from her care because\nthe goal was permanent custody and the new foster parent for Child 3 would be\ntaking all three siblings. Foster Parent 1 said, she was open to taking all three girls,\nbut instead of placing all three of the siblings with her, Ennis was seeking to remove\nChild 1 and Child 2 from her care. She reported there was an FTM on 10/9/2020,\nwhich she was invited to attended, but the children’s therapist was not. At that FTM\nFCW C reported Therapist F said it was in the best interest of Child 1 and Child 2 to\nbe moved with her sister; and Ennis said they were going to be moving the girls right\naway. Foster Parent 1 said Therapist F had never told her what Ennis reported\nTherapist F reported. She said she was attacked at the team meeting for not wanting\nto get the siblings together, which she denied was the case. She wanted to get all\nthree girls together in her home. She said, the group brought up the fact she filed\nfor a Foster Care Review Board (FCRB) hearing, and Children Ombudsmen\ncomplaint. They said they would let the FCRB settle the situation. The FCRB sided\nwith her on keeping the two girls in her care; and then a court hearing was\nscheduled to review the siblings’ placement plan.\nFoster Parent 1 telephoned me on 11/6/2020 of the court hearing’s outcome and\nconcern with reporting by Ennis at the hearing. The court ordered Child 1 and Child\n2’s placement with Child 3 in Foster Parent 3’s foster home. Foster Parent 1\nexpressed concern that the agency had advised the court that a licensing specialist,\ntold them Foster Parent 1 was too old. Foster Parent 1 thought the agency was\nreferring to me. I re-advised her that my role was to complete the agency’s special\ninvestigation related to alleged rule violations not make child placement decision on\nthis case. I would not be the licensing specialist the agency referenced in court.\nChief Administrator A and Administrator B as mentioned earlier in this report,\nacknowledged there were/are concerns related to all three siblings being placed with\nFoster Parent 1. There were agency discussions about such and with Foster Parent\n7",
    "1. Both administrators reported the agency stressed to Foster Parent 1 the plan was\nto have all three siblings placed together. This plan was explained to Foster Parent\n1 and Foster Parent 2 when the children were placed from a relative home to each\nrespective foster parent’s home in February 2020. Foster Parent 1 was never told\nshe needed to get a bigger vehicle in order to have placement of Child 3/being able\nto care for all the children. The agency never stopped working with Foster Parent 1\non Child 1 and Child 2’s needs. The GAL, Court and Ennis were in support of\nfinding a home that could take all three siblings and be able to meet their needs. A\nfoster home that could take all three children was also supported by the children’s\nbirth parents and Therapist F. Administrator B acknowledged that with Therapist F,\nTherapist F has wavered on whether the three children’s placement together should\nor should not be with Foster Parent 1. Therapist F had reported at a past provider’s\nmeeting that Foster Parent 1 was overwhelmed with the care of the children and\ncouldn’t handle it. Therapist F has since indicated it’s not her role to make child\nplacement decisions.\nBoth administrators reported Child 3 had to be replaced due to issues of her medical\nand educational needs not being met in Foster Parent 2’s home. The court\nauthorized that move. The agency’s intent with that replacement was that Child 1\nand Child 2 would also be placed within the new foster home. Foster Parent 1 was\nadvised Child 1 and Child 2’s replacements were pending. Foster Parent 1 appealed\nto the FCRB. On 10/13/2020 the FCRB indicated it would not be in Child 1 and\nChild 2’s best interest to be replaced from Foster Parent 1’s home. Thereafter, the\nmatter was scheduled with the court for a ruling about Child 1, Child 2, and Child 3’s\nplacements and that hearing was scheduled for 11/6/2020.\nOn 11/10/2020 during on an on-site agency visit, Administrator B reported the court\nordered placement of Child 1 and Child 2 in the new foster home, uniting the two\nwith siblings with Child 3. Foster Parent 1 did not take the matter well. The licensing\nworker is working with Foster parent 1 on moving Child 1 and Child 2 within the next\n30 days. Administrator B denied the agency reporting to the court anything related\nto me and a reporting by me. Administrator B did not know what Foster Parent 1\nmay have been referencing pertaining to a licensing person saying she was too old.\nOn 11/5/2020 I interviewed GAL E via telephone. GAL E reported, Child 1, Child 2\nand Child 3 were removed from their aunt’s care in February 2020. The department\nwas not able to place them with the grandmother, but the plan was always to keep\nthe siblings together. Ennis did not have a home for all three siblings initially but\nreported they would work on getting a home. A few weeks ago, Ennis reported\nhaving a home able to take all three siblings. Child 3 had to be moved from Foster\nParent 2’s home and was placed in the new foster home. As reported earlier, GAL E\nknew Foster Parent 1 was trying to pursue placement of Child 3. GAL E was not\nsupportive of that. She had concerns due to the fact Foster Parent 1 is over 60,\nwould have five children under 10 with special needs. GAL E questioned Foster\nParent 1’s ability to care for the three siblings given her age and the girls’ individual\nneeds. She supports Child 1 and Child 2’s move. She knew Foster Parent 1 reported\n8",
    "Therapist F was supportive of Foster Parent 1 obtaining placement of Child 3. Foster\nParent 1 said she had a letter from the therapist, but GAL E never saw or received\nsuch a letter from the therapist. GAL E reported the agency continues to work with\nFoster Parent 1 around the children and what they need.\nOn 11/5/2020 I interviewed FCW C by telephone. FCW C reported Foster Parent 1\nnever complained about the adoption of her granddaughter being delayed or\nconcerns about it with respect to trying to get placement of Child C. FCW C\nreported when the three siblings were placed on 2/19/2020, it was reported to both\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 the goal was to reunite the siblings. Both\nfoster parents had at one point, voiced wanting to get all three girls, but were not\nable to do so due to physical spacing issues and or the needs of the individual\nchildren in their care. Foster Parent 1 thought she could, but multiple service\nproviders working with Foster Parent 1 and the children in her care, did not think that\nwas a good idea. Those individuals included, herself, other agency staff, Child 1’s\nschool and the GAL. Therapist F, who was working with Child 1, Child 2 and Child\n3 in the home also felt Foster Parent 1 would not be able meet all three children’s\nneeds because of what Foster Parent 1 had “on her plate”/responsibility for her.\nHowever, Foster Parent 1 thought Therapist F believed Foster Parent 1 should have\nall three siblings. Therapist F never reported that to FCW, and Therapist F never\nsubmitted written monthly or quarterly therapeutic reports.\nFCW C reported the agency was always upfront with Foster Parent 1 related to the\nchildren’s needs, addressing her questions, concerns and working with her. FCW C\ndenied making false reports related to Therapist F recommendation but admitted\nTherapist F seems reluctant now to report a clear statement about placement\nrecommendation for the children. However, everyone supports all three children\nbeing together. FCW C reported, Foster Parent 1 was invited to and was a part of\nthe 10/9/2020 SAFE (Safety and Facilitation Expert)-FTM where the children’s case\nwas discussed. She said, all expressed information about the children, their needs\nand placement recommendation. Foster Parent 1 was never left out of the\ndiscussion. But the agency did not support having the children in long term\nplacement with Foster Parent 1 due to the children’s needs and Foster Parent 1’s\nspecific situation and the impact those could have to all three children’s need being\nmeet.\nOn 11/5/2020 I interviewed Therapist F by telephone. She reported seeing Child 1\nand Child 2 since January 2020. She only worked with Child 3 for two months;\n7/7/2020-10/9/2020. She was not aware of any agency staff making a false\nstatement pertaining to a recommendation she made or supported. She reported\nshe did not really make a placement recommendation. She said Child 1 and Child 2\nappeared to be doing well with Foster Parent 1; but she had only had a couple of\nsessions with Child 3. She expressed to the agency and Foster Parent 1 that it\nwould likely be less traumatic to move one child into the foster home with the two\nchildren as opposed to moving all three to another home. She left the placement\ndecision to Ennis’s foster care and licensing programs. She admitted expressing a\n9",
    "concern to FCW C related to Foster Parent 1 taking on another child, in that it would\nbe a lot for Foster Parent 1 to take on. However, Foster Parent 1 had reported\nFoster Parent 1 had support. Therapist F said she just said okay to the statement\nFoster Parent 1 had made about support. Therapist F reported her statements were\nacknowledgements not her recommendation for or against Foster Parent 1 over\nanother placement. She thought the agency should look at whether the children\nwould be going home. Whether it was absolutely necessary for them to be replaced.\nIf the children were going home, why replace them temporarily. If they were not\ngoing home, then yes, the three siblings should be placed together. Therapist F\nreported understanding that a lot goes into placement decisions, and that’s why she\nfelt it’s the agency’s decision and recommendation related to the children’s\nplacements.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\nANALYSIS: The evidence does not support the allegations. The agency was\nworking with all parties related to the children, their needs and\nplacement potentials. Foster Parent 1 disagreed with the\nagency does not recommending her for the siblings’ placement\nThe court ultimately made the decision related to all three\nchildren and their placement.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency did not invite the foster parent to a March and April 2020 FTM (Family\nTeam Meeting) which she was the subject of. Additionally, the agency did not invite\nthe children’s therapist to an FTM held on10/9/ 2020.\nINVESTIGATION:\nFoster Parent 1 reported the agency intentionally denied her an invitation to a March\nand April 2020 FTM. She said she was the subject of the meetings, so she should\nhave been invited. She reported the agency also did not invite Therapist F to a\n10/9//2020 FTM.\nOn 10/19/2020, MISACWIS case file documentation was reviewed, and the record\ndid not show documentation of a March or April 2020 FTM. An FTM was\n10",
    "documented for 2/18/2020 prior to the Child 1 and Child 2’s placement with Foster\nParent 1 related to placement and safety concerns. Another FTM was documented\nfor 5/27/2020, which showed Foster Parent 1 participated in. A 10/9/2020 SAFE\n(Safety and Facilitation Expert)-FTM was also documented, which Foster Parent 1\nreported participating in.\nChief Administrator A, Administrator B, and FCW C all reported there were no FTM\nheld in March or April 2020. They reported Foster Parent 1 was made aware of and\nattended FTMs held related to the siblings. This was inclusive of a 10/9/2020 SAFE-\nFTM that was facilitated by a trained departmental facilitator, not Ennis.\nAdministrator B and FCW C reported there was a concern mentioned that Therapist\nF was not invited or in attendance at the 10/9/2020 SAFE- FTM. Both explained that\nthe SAFE Facilitator not Ennis schedules and sent out the invites to these meetings.\nEnnis provides input as to who should be invited. As it relates to the 10/9/2020\nSAFE- FTM a mix-up occurred. This SAFE-FTM was actually scheduled for an\nearlier date. Therapist F was on the email/invite for the meeting set for earlier in\nOctober 2020. The date was changed to 10/9/2020 and Therapist F was left off the\nnext invite email. During the 10/9/2020 SAFE -FTM someone mentioned, or it was\nrealized Therapist F was not in attendance. During the meeting, they paused and\nFCW C called Therapist F. Therapist F did not answer and FCW C left a message\nasking Therapist F if she would be jointing the meeting. Therapist F called her back\nafter the meeting and spoke with FCW C. Therapist F said she was not aware/did\nnot get the updated invite.\nGAL E could not recall an FTM in March or April 2020. She recalled a 3/18/2020\ntelephone call with Foster Parent 1 and a 4/28/2020 court hearing. As for Therapist\nF being at or not being invited to the 10/9/2020 SAFE-FTM, GAL E said there were a\nlot of people in attendance. She said this meeting was not facilitated by Ennis. She\nsaid, it’s just workers, birth parents, parents’ attorneys, and GAL during FTMs.\nDuring the 10/9/2020 meeting Foster Parent 1 mentioned Therapist F being opposed\nto the children’s move; and it was realized Therapist F may not have been invited to\nthe meeting.
