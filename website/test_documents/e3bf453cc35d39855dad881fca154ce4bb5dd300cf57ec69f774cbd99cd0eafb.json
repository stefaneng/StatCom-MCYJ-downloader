Office areas are comfortable and sizable for clients and employees.\nSome offices are set up and furnished for seating for multiple clients and\nassociates. Offices are comfortable and functional. Lifeline files will be stored in\nthe back-office area on first floor. Lifeline plans to digitize all files as well. There\nare two bathrooms.

Program Description\nThe following information was provided by the agency and reviewed: Policies and\nprocedures, all annual budgets, and financial accounts for the fiscal year. Also\nreviewed were the agency statement of need, articles of incorporation document\nand non-profit status.\nLifeline will be placing children for adoption and evaluating applicants for\nadoption. Lifeline program statement says, the agency exists to equip the Body of\nChrist to manifest the gospel to vulnerable children, such as children who have\nexperienced trauma or children who are orphans. Lifeline defines orphan as the\nchild must have no parents, or a sole or surviving parent who is unable to care for\nthe child and has, in writing, irrevocably released the child for emigration and\nadoption. Orphan care is serving orphans through adoption, education,\ndiscipleship, life skills, etc. Additionally, Lifeline defines vulnerable children by any\nchild the agency serves outside of the orphan definition who have experienced,\nhurt, trauma, homelessness, etc. that are not available for adoption. Lifeline’s\npurpose is to provide a hope and a future through the gospel for vulnerable\nchildren around the world by discipling, engaging, and equipping the body of\nChrist. Lifeline of Michigan will achieve this through domestic and international\nadoption programs, as well as equipping the church to provide support and\n3",
    "training to families in need. Lifeline believes vulnerable children and their\ncommunities are transformed by the gospel and are making disciples. The core\nvalues of Lifeline are gospel-driven, discipleship-focused, excellence-directed,\nbiblically integrous, local church-centered, birth parent reconciliation and\nredemption, global compassion, and holistic care.\nLifeline seeks to help families in Michigan who wish to grow their family through\nadoption. This will be completed through home studies, training and education,\npre-placement and post placement support, and post adoption services including\ncounseling. Most adoptions are from private clients which is a part of the agency\nreferral source. Lifeline will determine adoption eligibility through an orientation\nand home study process to ensure that Michigan regulations and Lifeline\nrequirements are met before completion. Lifeline is a faith-based nonprofit\nministry which partners with families who align with the agency faith and the\ntenets of their beliefs. The agency process includes a pre-application including the\nrequirement of agreement with the statement of faith, which is based on orthodox\nChristian doctrine; these include both marriage and faith. If both spouses cannot\nagree with the agency statement of faith or have different views or beliefs than the\nagency, the agency respects that and will gladly connect the family with an\nagency that more closely aligns with their beliefs and interests. The agency will\nwork with single women in select countries and will partner with their international\nadoption programs for additional services.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nNone.\n4",
