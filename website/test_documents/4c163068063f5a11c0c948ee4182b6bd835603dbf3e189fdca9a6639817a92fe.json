    "II. ALLEGATION:\nViolation\nEstablished?\nStaff punched 18-year-old youth in the face in response to the Yes\nyouth spitting in his face\nAdditional Findings No\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n02/17/2022 Special Investigation Intake\n2022C0108014\n02/17/2022 Special Investigation Initiated - On Site\nViewed video; interviewed youth and staff; reviewed incident\nreport; nursing assessment; witness statements\n02/22/2022 Contact – Telephone call received\nInterviewed staff\n02/22/2022 Contact – Telephone call made\nPlacement Coordination Unit (PCU) phone conference\n02/24/2022 Pre-exit with Director 1\nALLEGATION:\nStaff allegedly punched 18-year-old youth in the face in response to the youth spitting in\nhis face.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI viewed video of the incident on-site and Director 1 also provided a hard copy via\nflash drive. Prior to the start of the video, Director 1 said Youth D had already\nremoved his shirt, pulled the sprinkler system in his room causing it to flood and staff\nremoved all of the other youth off the pod as a precaution. Director 1 explained that\nYouth D had a court hearing the day after the incident and “tends to assault people\nbefore court.”\n2",
    "Video of Pod 4 on 2/16/22\n1:38:31 – Youth D is sitting shirtless in the general area on top of a table. Staff 1 is\nstanding in a puddle of water looking through the window of Youth D’s room.\nSupervisor 2 is exiting the pod, leaving Staff 1 alone with Youth D. As Supervisor 2\nexits, Youth D hops off of the tabletop and approaches Staff 1.\n1:38:35 – As the exit door closes behind Supervisor 2, Staff 1 approaches the same\nexit door with Youth D walking beside him.\n1:38:44 to 1:39:17 - Staff 1 and Youth D stand at the exit door talking.\n1:39:18 – With Youth D standing beside him, Staff 1 unlocks the door and starts to\nexit the pod, which would have left Youth D alone in the general area.\n1:39:20 to 1:39:28 Youth D pushes the left side of his body into Staff 1’s right side\nand attempts to exit the pod with Staff 1. Supervisor 2 is on the outside of the door.\nHe pushes the door closed from the outside and remains in the hall. Staff 1 faces\nYouth D, grabs his wrists, raises his arms above his head and attempts to restrain\nthe youth against the wall.\n1:39:28 – Supervisor 2 re-enters the pod and attempts to physically intervene by\ngrabbing at or holding one of Youth D’s wrists for the next 11 seconds while the\naltercation continues.\n1:39:39 - Supervisor 2 steps back and calls on the radio for assistance while Staff 1\nand Youth D continue to tussle, interlocked with one another.\n1:39:39 to 1:40:26 – Using his weight and momentum, Staff 1 pushes Youth D\nagainst the wall several times while Supervisor 2 holds Youth D’s right wrist but is\nunable to stop the altercation.\n1:40:27 – Security Supervisor 3 enters the pod. Staff 1 swings his right fist toward\nYouth D’s face and then sends an uppercut with his left fist.\n1:40:32 to 1:40:37 Staff 1 steps back while both supervisors huddle around Youth D\ntrying to protect him. Staff 1 appears to be exiting the pod, but suddenly turns back\nand swings again at Youth D while Supervisor 1 extends his arm to block Staff 1.\n1:40:37 – Security Supervisor 3 motions for Staff 1 to exit the pod. Staff 1 exits into\nthe hall but stands in the doorway with the pod door open.\n1:40:51 to 1:41:10 – Staff 1 re-enters the pod approaching Youth D who has moved\nwith the supervisors into the general area. Youth D re-escalates. Supervisor 1 hand\ngestures for Staff 1 to halt. Staff 1 disregards the supervisor’s direction, and\n3",
    "approaches the youth anyway, appearing to taunt him. Both supervisors struggle to\nhold Youth D back from physically re-engaging with Staff 1.\n1:41:10 – Security Staff 4 enters the pod. Staff 1 exits the pod door again, this time\nclosing the door behind himself.\n1:41:10 – 1:41:25 – Youth D deescalates and sits back on the top of the table.\nDocumentation\nAn incident report by Facility Manager 1 dated 2/16/22 indicates the following:\n“While on Pod 4, Youth D became upset and began pacing the pod threatening\nstaff. As Staff 1 tried to exit the pod through the resident’s pod door, Youth D\nassaulted Staff 1 trying to force his way out of the door into the hallway. Security\ncalled for assistance Supervisor 2 arrived on the scene and intervened by\nattempting to separate the two unsuccessfully. Youth D resisted attempts and\nbegan to throw punches at Staff 1 and spit in Staff 1’s face. Staff 1 then began to\nexchange punches with Youth D before Supervisor 2 and Security Supervisor 3\nwere able to separate them.\nAfter review of the incident via camera, Staff 1 was immediately released from\nhis duties and the facility. Director 1 was notified immediately. Youth D’s CMO\nworker was contacted at 3:45pm. Youth D was examined by the medical\ndepartment for further evaluation. He did not sustain any injuries and chose not\nto press charges. Licensing and CPS were contacted. A safety plan is in place\nas Staff 1 has been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.”\nA written statement by Staff 1 dated 2/16/22 indicates: “Was walking out of this pod\nwhen Youth D tried to escape. I pinned against the wall. Supervisor 2 stop\nrestraining and he hit me so I pin him back against the wall and he started spitting.”\nA written statement by Security Supervisor 3 dated 2/16/22 indicates:\n“Security was called to Pod 4. I immediately ran down to the pod. Once I arrived to\nthe resident door, I opened it to find Youth D being physically aggressive with staff\non the pod. I intervene removing resident back toward the dayroom and away from\neveryone else. From there I work on deescalating Youth D.”\nA note by Nurse 1 dated 2/16/22 indicates:\n“Called to pod by Facility Manager 1 to see Youth D after some kind of physical\naltercation. Resident refused to be seen…Agitated, irritable, dismissing of writer and\ncare…Refused to be seen by writer.”\nTraining records indicate Staff 1 attended “Handle with Care” verbal de-escalation\ntraining on 1/21/22 and physical intervention training on 1/22/22.\n4",
    "Interviews\nI interviewed Youth D, age 18. He said he has been at the facility for 2.5 years.\nSpeech difficulties were evident. I asked Youth D about the incident with Staff 1. He\nadmitted he pushed against Staff 1 in an attempt to exit the pod. He did not know\nwhy he wanted to exit. After that, Youth D said he and Staff 1 were grabbing each\nother and he was holding onto Staff 1’s shirt. He denied that Staff 1 punched or\nswung at him, adding “I’ve got short-term memory loss…I got a head injury when I\nwas age 2.” Youth D said he had no injuries resulting from the altercation.\nAccording to Director 1, Staff 1 has only worked at the facility for one month. He\nwas suspended immediately following the incident and his employment will likely be\nterminated. I was unable to interview him because the facility was unable to reach\nhim or leave a message.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 who has worked at the facility for five months. Asked\nwhy he left Staff 1 alone with Youth D just prior to the incident, he said he left\nbecause he assessed that Youth D was “fine.” After exiting, he heard commotion\nfrom the hall. Supervisor 2 looked through the door window and “it looked\naggressive.” “Youth D was being assaultive, reaching at Staff 1. I came in and tried\nto separate them at first. Youth D spit toward Staff 1 and on me. It landed on my\nneck. Staff 1 was upset. I stood between them. Staff 1 threw a couple punches…I\ndidn’t see if it connected.”\nI interviewed Security Supervisor 3 by phone. He has worked at the facility for five\nyears. Security Supervisor 3 said he was called to Pod 4. Upon entering, he saw\nYouth D “being aggressive” and separated him from Staff 1. Security Supervisor 3\nsaid he did not see Staff 1 punch or swing at Youth D. He denied that Staff 1 was\nphysically aggressive toward the youth. After Youth D and Staff 1 were separated.\nSecurity Supervisor 3 said Youth D spit in Staff 1’s direction causing Staff 1 to\nbecome “verbally aggressive.” “I asked him to leave. He didn’t leave right away.\nHe was told again.”\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(a) Any type of corporal punishment inflicted in any\nmanner.\nANALYSIS: Video footage shows Staff D threw two punches toward Youth\nD’s face and chest. After assistance arrived and the two were\nphysically disengaged, Staff 1 reapproached the youth twice\nmore, swinging at him a third time and provoking the youth with\nhis presence.\nIt could not be determined by the video whether or not Staff 1’s\nswings connected with any part of the youth’s body. Youth D\nsaid he did not remember being punched due to short-term\nmemory loss stemming from a head injury at age 2.\nAfter the incident, Youth D refused to be examined by the nurse,\nbut denied any injuries resulting from the altercation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: When Youth D pushed his left shoulder against Staff 1’s right\nshoulder attempting to exit, Staff 1 grabbed and held the youth’s\narm(s)/wrist(s) above his head against the wall, restricting the\nyouth’s movement. This is not an approved physical\nmanagement technique.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
