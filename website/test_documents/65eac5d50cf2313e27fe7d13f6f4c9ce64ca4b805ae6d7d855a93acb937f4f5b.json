INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n1",
    "(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 allegedly put her hands around Youth P's neck causing\nbruising.\nInvestigation I notified Foster Care Worker of this investigation assignment.\nShe expressed no concerns about the facility.\nI coordinated a joint investigation with Government Worker 1.\nI contacted Rights Officer who said Youth P made a verbal\ncomplaint about the alleged incident last week. He looked into the\ncomplaint and found no evidence that it occurred, but Youth P\ndisagreed with his findings and called in the complaint herself.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nThere are no cameras in the laundry room.\nVIDEO of hall\n3:31pm Staff 1 unlocks the laundry room door for Youth P and\nstands in the hall using her foot to prop open the door. Youth P\nenters the laundry room alone.\n3:32 – 3:34pm Youth P is in the laundry room alone. Staff 1 is in\nthe hall propping the door open.\n3:34pm Staff 2 walks through the hall, enters the laundry room,\nexits with a broom and sweeps the hallway.\n3:35:40pm Youth P exits the laundry room.\nYouth P is the complainant. I interviewed Youth P jointly with\nGovernment Worker 1 on 7/13/23. She has been at Vista Maria\nfor one month. On 7/2/23 Youth P said she and Staff 1 were\nconversing inside of the laundry room. “I asked why she (Staff 1)\nhad to watch me do laundry. She got snippy and put her hand like\nthis.” Youth P demonstrated by putting her hand against her right\nclavicle. “There was a bruise (that no one saw) but it’s gone\nnow…I couldn’t lift my shoulder for two days.”\nYouth P said no other staff or youth saw this occur. “She (Staff 1)\ndid it in the laundry room where there’s no cameras.” Youth P\n2",
    "said she filed a complaint with Rights Officer. “He (Rights Officer)\nchecked the cameras in the hall and didn’t see it.” Youth P\nadmitted that prior to this incident, she and Staff 1 did not get\nalong well.\nA medical progress note dated 7/6/23 indicates Youth P\ncomplained of shoulder pain that originated on 7/3/23. “Doctor\nstated youth has a muscle strain and should rest.” Rights Officer\nreported Youth P had been swimming several days previously\nwhich could explain the muscle strain.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Quality\nManagers 1 and 2 present. Staff 2 has worked at the facility over\na year. She did not recall seeing anything unusual between Staff\n1 and Youth P. However, she said at some point, Staff 1 was\n“agitated” with Youth P after the youth called her “grandma.”\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker 1 and\nQuality Managers 1 and 2 present. She has been an afternoon\nshift supervisor for two years. Supervisor was unaware of any\nincident in the laundry room. However, she said Youth P has been\nvery “disrespectful” to Staff 1 and other staff.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Quality\nManagers 1 and 2 present. She has worked at the facility part-\ntime for a year. Government Worker 1 read the allegation aloud to\nStaff 1. Staff 1 responded, “None of that happened. I never\ntouched her…I wasn’t ever alone in the laundry room with her. I\nstood outside the door having a conversation…Rights Officer\ninvestigated and said there’s no evidence.”\nStaff 1 explained that prior to Youth P making this allegation,\nYouth P had made racial slurs toward her calling her a “stupid\nblack bitch.” “She (Youth P) had been arguing with me. I asked\nSupervisor to be removed from the wing.”\nStaff 1 became increasingly escalated during the interview saying\nshe will not tolerate disrespect from youths. She referred to\n“being lied on” by Youth P and was still visibly angry toward her.\nStaff 1 was also visibly offended when Government Worker 1\nasked her routine mandatory questions about her personal life.\nThere are no disciplinary write-ups in Staff 1’s employee file.\nRights Officer’s written notes dated 7/6/23 indicated Supervisor\nreported Youth P uses the word “rachet, asked if her food was\n3",
    "made by “a black person,” and makes offensive comments toward\nmultiple staff.\nStaff 1 said Youth P repeatedly uses the “N word” and targets\npeople’s race and sexual orientation. “She talks about nasty shit\nwhen she finds out about my romantic partner and threatens to\n“get one of these black mother fuckers fired.”\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings to their investigation.\nAnalysis Evidence does not support the allegation.\nCONSULTATION\nIt appears Staff 1 has strong feelings about Youth P disrespecting\nher. I recommend they do not work together until a mediation/\ndebriefing session can be held and feelings resolved and possible\nsome additional training for Staff 1.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJuly 27, 2023\n_____________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 7, 2023\n_____________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
