What we do\nteach is defensive positioning, which is putting your hands up in\nfront of you should you need to fend off any attempted strikes.\nWe do not push or strike a client while doing this, but we can\ndemonstrate and role model how much space is appropriate. We\nalso position ourselves to keep everyone safe by doing a\nnumber of things, including backing up from an aggressive client,\nstanding not directly in front of an aggressive client, and creating\nas much space as is necessary to maintain everyone’s safety.\nThis also includes staff using a hand up to role model\nappropriate space.” From this email is consistent with Staff 1’s",

When an environment that\nis excessively controlled by the staff is at risk for disruption and\noffers fewer opportunities for youth to make choices and\nexercise the responsibility of self-control. The treatment team\nshould develop skill and finesse in each of its members in\nsensing when it time to step in, when to selectively ignore, and\nwhen to encourage alternatives.\n• Wedgwood Crisis Management Procedures- Physical\nManagement may only occur with a client whose behavior is\nsignificantly dangerous to self or others. Physical Management is\nperformed according to the current techniques of the “Aegis\nSystem”, Wedgwood’s approved crisis intervention program.
