    "ALLEGATION:\nA staff member attempted to place youth in an approved physical management due\nto youth's aggression. It was alleged that staff placed youth in a hold and became\nphysically assaultive causing several scratches and bruising on youth's neck,\nshoulder, side of rib cage, arms, and behind ear.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker by phone on 3/29/2021. She reported already being\nmade aware of the allegations and that she is planning on visiting with Resident A later\ntoday.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 at the facility in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist\non 3/29/2021. He provided several documents including incident reports, policy/procedures\nand face sheets on the residents that would be interviewed. He also provided Staff 1’s\npersonnel file for review which included his training history. He reported that Staff 1 has not\nworked with Resident A since the incident took place.\nI interviewed Resident A at the facility in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist on\n3/29/2021. He reports remembering the incident which began in the gym. He gave recall of\nthe incident.\nIt happened in the gym after I got into a fight with another kid. I was pissed that day. I\nwas sitting in the office with Staff 1 talking about what happened in the gym. He was not\nprocessing the incident with me; he was just telling me I was going to get a consequence\nfor just getting into a fight. He was just trying to give me a consequence not trying to\ndeescalate me. I told him that I’m not afraid of anyone in this place and he said that if I\nhit him, he would box me. He just kept trying to make everything my fault. So, I threw a\ncoffee pot on the floor and told Staff 1 to clean it up. It was glass and broke. Then I went\nout and slammed the door behind me. Staff 1 came out of the office and said again that\nif I hit him, we would box, and he started staring me down. I started hitting him and he\ntried to restrain me. He also said “shit isn’t sweet around here”. A couple of times I\ncouldn’t breathe, and everything became a blur. At some point he took me to the ground\nafter pushing me up against the corner of the wall. While we slid to the ground, he had\nhis hands behind my neck. Once we were on the floor, I started headbutting him and this\nis when Staff 2 started to help.\nResident A reported that Staff 2 “did not do anything he was not supposed to do”. He also\nreported that Staff 2 told Staff 1 to “get him off the ground”. He stated, Staff 2 was present\nthroughout the whole restraint” and “Staff 2 was trying to deescalate me, but Staff 1 was\nnot”. Resident A reported that Supervisor 1, Resident B, Resident C, and Resident D all\nwitnessed the restraint noted in the allegations. Resident A reported “during the restraint I\nstarted crying because I felt helpless, and Staff 1 said ‘oh shit you don’t get to cry now’”.\nResident A reports having no contact with Staff 1 since the incident, and he ended by\nreporting that he feels safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Resident B at the facility in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist on\n3/29/2021. He reports being present during the restraint noted in the allegations. He stated,\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "I know Staff 1 and Resident A were in the office processing the earlier incident when I\nheard glass break. Then I heard the door slam and a loud “fuck you”. This is when I\ncame out of the game room and saw Resident A trying to fight Staff 1. Both staff seemed\naggressive, but Staff 1 was using a lot more force with Resident A. Then Staff 1 pushed\nResident A against the wall and had his arm against Resident A’s neck, holding him\nagainst the wall.\nResident B reported hearing Staff 1 tell Resident A he would box him. He also reported\nhearing Staff 1 say to Resident A “why are you crying now” after Resident A began to cry\nduring the restraint. He reported hearing Staff 1 say “not the right staff to hit”. Resident B\nreports that Staff 2 was “calming down Resident A” and “helped him stop being mad”.\nResident B ended by reporting that although he doesn’t like being in the program because\n“they take privileges away for little things”, he still feels safe.\nI interviewed Resident C at the facility in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist on\n3/29/2021. He reports remembering the restraint noted in the allegations. He stated, “I’m not\nsure what happened” but I “saw a little bit of the restraint”. He also reported a belief that\nStaff 1 antagonized Resident A, but he was unable to identify what he based this belief on\nother than Resident A being very upset. Resident C gave the following description.\nI heard the coffee thing break and when I looked, Staff 1 was restraining Resident A but\nnot in the right way. Staff 1 was being very aggressive and holding Resident A too tight.\nResident A said that he couldn’t breathe. Staff 2 tried to get in and pull Resident A away\nfrom Staff 1.\nResident C ended by reporting that he has not seen Staff 1 since the incident and that he\nfeels safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Resident D at the facility in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist on\n3/29/2021. He reports remembering the restraint and was present for part of it. He gave the\nfollowing description.\nResident A broke a glass thing and came out of the office using curse words. Resident A\nstarted hitting staff and Staff 1 started to restrain him. Staff 2 helped with the restraint.\nI’ve never seen a restraint like that before. Staff 1 seemed very upset and was very\naggressive. He seemed to be mad that Resident A was hitting him. I heard Resident A\nsay he couldn’t breathe three to four times and just before they went to the floor. I also\nheard Staff 1 say that he would do boxing on Resident A and Staff 1 told Resident A\ndon’t be crying now, when he started to cry.\nResident D reported that he observed marks on Resident A’s head when he saw him later.\nResident D ended by reporting that he feels safe at the facility.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist on\n3/29/2021. He reports remembering the restraint of Resident A and gave the following\ndescription of the incident.\nWe went into the office to talk about what happened in the gym earlier. I was going to\nprocess the incident with him, but he just started saying how he hates everything here. I\npointed out his behaviors are keeping him down and he responded by saying he doesn’t\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "want anyone to control him. I told him I’m not against trying to help him, but he stayed\nfocused on ‘tired of being here with these fucking kids’. He also said that he would shoot\nanyone in the street if they confronted him and he made the symbol of a gun with his\nfingers. I told him I’m done talking and that the shift supervisor will handle his\nconsequences for his behavior in the gym. He got upset over the idea of having\nconsequences and got up and pushed past me. The next thing I heard was glass\nshattering at my feet and he stormed out of the office, slamming the door behind him.\nStaff 1 reported that when he went out of the office, Resident A hit him on the left side of his\nhead with his fist. He also reported that Resident A was “outraged”, and Staff 2 tried to\nrestrain Resident A. He continued his recall of the incident once outside of the office.\nHe kept coming at me and I was trying to help Staff 2 restrain him. Resident A went for\nmy face and grabbed my nose. He even kicked me in my arm. We finally got him in a\ntwo-person standing hold. Resident A said his neck or wrist hurt so I released his arm\nand he swung at me again. He was headbutting me when we slid to the floor. We went\nto the floor because Resident A dropped his weight. I had my arms over his arms and\nnot behind his head.\nStaff 1 reported that he and Staff 2 were both talking to Resident A throughout the restraint\nin an effort to deescalate him. He also admitted that he did say “you can’t hit me and cry\nagain”. He reported a belief that the restraint and Resident A’s acting out had nothing to do\nwith him. He did not recall hearing Resident A say he couldn’t breathe.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist on\n3/29/2021. She reports being present for part of the restraint but that she was also involved\nin supervision of other residents so she “didn’t see a lot of it”. She also reports being in the\nkitchen “working on lunch” when she heard the glass break. She stated, “when I went to the\narea, Staff 1 and Staff 2 had Resident A in a 2-person standing hold. Resident A started\nheadbutting them, so I put my hand up to block his head.” She reported that when Resident\nA dropped his weight, Staff 2 let go but Staff 1 continued to hold him. She ended by\nreporting overhearing Staff 1 say “you better not be starting that crying shit again”, which\nshe reported escalated Resident A. She stated, “at this point, Staff 2 took over and escorted\nResident A to his room”. She also stated, “Staff 1 tends to get into power struggles with\nresidents and doesn’t have a good relationship with them”.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist on 3/29/2021.\nHe reports remembering the incident and that he was involved with other residents when he\nheard glass break. He also reports that he observed “the office door being pushed open\nreally hard as Resident A came through it”. Staff 2 gave the following recall of the incident.\nResident A tried to slam the door on Staff 1 and when Staff 1 came out of the office,\nResident A began to punch him in the face. I got the other residents out of the area and\nsaw that Staff 1 dropped his keys on the floor. I picked up the keys and noticed that Staff\n1 had Resident A in a 1-person standing hold with his arm on Resident A’s neck. I\nmoved his forearm from Resident A’s neck, and we moved to a 2-person standing hold.\nResident A dropped his weight and I let go of him. When Resident A stood back up, he\nbegan to cry and that is when Staff 1 said ‘you can stop all that crying shit now”. This\nstatement only caused Resident A to become escalated again and he started punching\nStaff 1 again. I got between them and took Resident A to his room.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "Staff 2 reported that Staff 1’s use of his forearm on Resident A was not a correct behavior\nmanagement technique. He also reported a belief that Staff 1 “let what happened in the\noffice get to him”. He reports not hearing Staff 1 say he would box Resident A but being told\nby Resident A that Staff 1 said “something like that”.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 by phone on 4/19/2021. She reports being the facility trainer\nfor the behavior management system. She provided copies of the techniques that are\napproved for the use with residents. She reported that all staff were retrained on the\ntechniques on the Thursday prior to the Sunday incident that occurred. She also reported\nbeing aware of the allegations and that the use of a forearm on the torso of a resident is a\nprohibited technique and “should never be used”.\nDocuments reviewed:\nPersonnel file of Staff 1: I reviewed the personnel file of Staff 1 and the following\ndocumentation was found. There was a “Growth Plan” dated 11/11/2020 which documented\nthe following.\nStaff 1’s probationary period is scheduled to end on November 13th, 2020. During this\nprobationary period, the Home and Assistant Supervisor have engaged staff in several\ncoaching conversations. The coaching conversations focused on staff’s hesitancy or lack\nof redirecting client and taking preventative actions to avoid or deescalate situation\nwhich could lead to crisis.\nThis document also lists the “Action Plan” for improvement with Staff 1. The following\nactions are to be accomplished by Staff 1 during his extended probationary period.\nStaff will be expected to report to all shifts as scheduled. This includes any mandatory team\nmeetings or trainings.\nStaff will be expected to develop a therapeutic rapport/relationship with all program\nclients.\nStaff will be expected to monitor client’s behavior and hold them accountable to the\nprogram’s rules and expectations using established agency interventions.\nStaff will be expected to demonstrate timely use of non-violent interventions through\nverbal de-escalation. He will also be expected to engage in approved agency physical\nmanagement techniques when clients are in danger of harming themselves or others.\nStaff will be expected to meet with Home and Assistant Supervisor weekly to discuss his\nprogress or issues related to this Growth Plan.\nI reviewed a document titled “Probation Removal Letter” dated 1/8/21. This document\nindicates that Staff 1 successfully completed his “extended probation period”. It states, “have\nbeen evaluated and rated by your supervisor. You have been found competent to perform\nthe expectations of the position. As a result you are being removed from probation effective\n1/8/21.”\nDocumentation of training hours was reviewed, and Staff 1 has completed 94 hours of\ntraining over the past year. Documentation also indicates that he completed three hours of\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "“Crisis Prevention & De-escalation training on 3/25/21 and scored a 100% on the final exam.\nThis same training is documented as being completed by Staff 1 on 11/7/2020 with the\nsame 100% final test score.\nIncident Report. I reviewed the incident report for the allegations. This document is dated\n3/28/21 and is identified as “Report # 10684”. This document is very similar to the reports\ngiven by the staff and residents present. Prior to the physical intervention it is stated, “Staff 1\nfelt that the conversation was heading nowhere, so he told him, \" I'm done. I am going to let\nyou talk to the shift supervisor, and he will discuss your consequences with you\".” It noted in\nthis document that “At one point it appeared as if Staff 1 had Resident A in a choke hold.\nResident A was still being combative with Staff 1 and fighting off the attempted one person\nEBR. Resident A kept going after Staff 1. It is also noted “The physical management was\nended at 1:25 pm. Client stood up and went to give Staff 2 a hug and started crying. Staff 1\nsaid to client that he better not be doing that “crying shit now\". Client escalated again and\nattempted to attack Staff 1, but Staff 2 was able to step in between and help client de-\nescalate and get client to his room to further de-escalate.”\nPolicy/Procedures. I reviewed the following policy/procedures:\nBehavior Management Procedures 05-01 states “Whenever clinically advisable, staff\nmembers are to first employ preventive and/or supportive behavior management\ntechniques, including a variety of de-escalation approaches and activation of client\nself-control plans.”\nBehavior Management Procedures Recommended Techniques 05-01.1 states\n“Power of the Question: An emotional client can be unsafe to self/others. Ask a\nquestion to enhance a cognitive response thereby increasing safety.”\nBehavior Management Procedures Prohibited Techniques 05-01.2 states “Use of\nprofanity or sarcasm against a client. This method is considered morally\nunacceptable and is counterproductive in a treatment setting.” “Excessive physical\nrestraint: During physical restraint, only as much force as is necessary to contain\naggressive behavior may be applied.”\nCrisis Management Techniques 05-02 states “Wedgwood staff members are expected to\navoid the use of physical management whenever possible.”\nBehavior Management Techniques. I reviewed the behavior management techniques that\nstaff are trained on. The facility uses the approved Aegis System for behavior management.\nThe description for the “Emergency Benevolent Restraint” is when the single staff moves\ntheir arms in an effort to get behind the resident. There is no description of staff placing their\nforearm on the chest or torso of the resident.\nDHHS investigative pre-disposition call. The other DHHS investigator found a\npreponderance of evidence to support that abuse/neglect occurred.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
