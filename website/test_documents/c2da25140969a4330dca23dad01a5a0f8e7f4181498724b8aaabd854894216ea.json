Youth A was\nrestrained on 3/7/2023 however a different situation in the\ncafeteria and Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3 were not involved.\n• Staff Safety Plan for Staff 1 effective 1/19/2024-3/31/2024:\nStaff 1 is not to be alone with any youth at any time. Staff 1\nwill not engage in any physical restraint unless she is the\nonly staff available and will remove herself as soon as\npossible. If an occurrence requiring CPI to de-escalate or\nphysically manage arises, Staff 1 should be removed from\nthe situation as soon as possible.\n• Wolverine Human Services Employee standards of\nconduct: WHS Staff shall uphold legal and accepted\nmoral codes pertaining to professional conduct including\nthose imposed by the Department of Child Welfare\nLicensing (DCWL).

They are only used to protect client or others\nfrom unanticipated or severely aggressive behavior that\nplaces them at serious threat of violence or injury if no\nimmediate intervention occurs.\n• Wolverine Human Services PREA Policy: When staff of the\nopposite gender enters the youth sleeping area and\nbathroom areas of the house, they must announce their\npresence. When a staff of the opposite gender is assigned\nto work with the group staff must announce their presence\nwhen entering a resident housing unit.\n• Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4’s personnel file: There\nwas no disciplinary record for Staff 2.

It also does not appear Staff\n4 ever worked a night shift as he was a second shift supervisor\nand never worked any shifts alone.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is recommended the facility update Wolverine Human Services\nPolicy and Procedure for TCI in Residential Programs as the\npolicy also references CPI. It is recommended the facility address\nin the policy how staff are to respond when a youth is not fully\nclothed in restraints.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n3/6/2024\n______________________________________\nJennifer Pastorick Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 8, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
