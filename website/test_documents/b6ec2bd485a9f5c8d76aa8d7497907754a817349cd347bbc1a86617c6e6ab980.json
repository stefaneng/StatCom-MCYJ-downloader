    "10/10/2022 Contact - Document Sent\nEmail exchange with CA.\nALLEGATION:\nWithin the last week, a staff dragged youth across the carpet which resulted in\ncarpet burns on youth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received 09/08/2022 and investigated in collaboration with\nDHHS Specialist\nI interviewed Chief Administrator on 09/09/2022 at the facility, in collaboration with\nthe DHHS Specialist. CA reported Nurse 1 called her on 09/08/2020 and informed\nthat Youth A had a scab mark on his arm, but no medical treatment was required.\nShe said the therapist spoke with Youth A and Youth A reported that he was doing\nsomething he was not supposed to and that’s when Staff 1 pulled him by the leg.\nYouth A could not remember when this incident occurred. CA said Staff 1 has been\nemployed at the facility since 05/23/2022 and has no discipline reports.\nI interviewed Youth A on 09/09/2022 at the facility, in collaboration with DHHS\nSpecialist. Youth A was observed to have a scab on his left arm. Youth A reported\nhe got the scab, because he was not listening, and Staff 1 grabbed him by the leg.\nHe could not recall which leg was grabbed or when the incident occurred. He initially\nsaid it happened two weeks ago and then said maybe was three weeks ago. He said\nStaff 1 didn’t mean to hurt him and this happened by accident. Youth A could not\nrecall if anyone witnessed the incident, but he thinks maybe Staff 2 was working on\nthe day of the incident. Youth A said he didn’t tell anyone about the bruise when it\nhappened.\nI interviewed Youth B on 09/09/2022 at the facility, in collaboration with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Youth B reported he gets enough to eat, gets his medication daily, and\nfeels safe. He denied witnessing staff do anything to hurt Youth A or to any other\nyouth at the facility. He said his favorite staff member is Staff 1. Youth B was eager\nto go back outside, so he would not miss recess time.\nI interviewed Youth C on 09/09/2022 at the facility, in collaboration with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Youth C has been at the facility for five years and his favorite staff\nmember is Staff 1. Youth C reported Staff 1 always makes time to listen to him and\nhe is nice. Youth C denied witnessing any staff member drag or doing anything to\nhurt Youth A. Youth C said Youth A is very aggressive with staff and Youth A does\nnot like it when he does not get his way, but he has never witnessed staff do\nanything to hurt Youth A. Youth C reported feeling safe and expressed no concerns.\n3",
    "I interviewed Nurse 1 on 09/09/2022 at the facility, in collaboration with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Nurse 1 reported she was doing a medication review for Youth A and\nthat’s when Youth A said he had a bruise on his arm. She examined Youth A and\nobserved a healing abrasion on his arm. Youth A told her that the staff did not do it\non purpose. Youth A did not provide specific details about when the incident\noccurred. Nurse 1 reported the bruise had scabbed and it could not be determined\nwhen it happened.\nI interviewed Complainant/Therapist on 09/09/2022 at the facility, in collaboration\nwith the DHHS Specialist. Therapist reported he has been working with Youth A for\ntwo months and Youth A had not reported any previous concerns regarding Staff 1\nor any other staff. He reported Youth A struggles with being told “no” and will have\noutbursts and tantrums when he does not get his way. Youth A told him on\n09/06/2022 about the bruise on his arm and that it was caused by Staff 1.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 09/09/2022 at the facility, in collaboration with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Staff 1 has been working at the facility for 3 months and has completed\nall his training including CPI. Staff 1 recalled a few days ago he took a marker away\nfrom Youth A, because he was writing on his face. Youth A got upset, was crawling\non the floor, and tried to grab a pencil, so he grabbed him by his left ankle and\nmoved him away from the pencil. He moved him less then a foot away from the\npencil. Staff 1 said Youth A has a history of self-harming and he was trying to\nprevent him from grabbing the pencil. He denied dragging or causing any injuries.\nStaff 1 said Youth A did not report having any injuries or complained about being in\npain. He did not complete an incident report, because Youth A did not get to the\npencil, he was not injured, and Youth A did not report being hurt. Staff 1 said the\nother youths were in their bedrooms and did not witness the incident.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 09/09/2022 at the facility, in collaboration with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Staff 2 denied witnessing any staff member dragging or doing anything to\nhurt Youth A. He said Youth A is easily triggered and aggravated when he does not\nget his way, so staff does redirect by talking to him. Youth A did not report being hurt\nor having any injuries. Staff 2 said he has not had to restrain any youth and has not\nwitnessed staff restrain a youth.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 on 09/09/2022 via telephone, in collaboration with the\nDHHS Specialist. Supervisor 1 reported he is not aware of any incident involving\nYouth A being dragged on the floor and having injuries. Supervisor 1 said Youth A\ndoes require a lot of redirecting because he is easily triggered when he does not get\nhis way. He said Youth A is manipulative and does not always tell the truth.\nSupervisor 1 reported he has never observed Staff 1 grab or doing anything that\nwould hurt the youths. He said Staff 1 goes above and beyond in doing his job to\nensure the safety and wellbeing of the youths. Staff 1 does not have any discipline\non file.\n4",
    "I Interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Specialist via telephone on 09/16/2022. She\nreported Youth A has been at the facility for 3 months and has been making\nprogress. Youth A does have a history of threatening to hurt himself and make false\nallegations, when he does not get his way, or he is redirected. She had been\nmeeting weekly with Youth A and he had not reported any concerns.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Facility’s Residential Treatment Overview/ Behavior management policy.\n• Body chart for Youth A completed by Nurse 1 on 09/06/2022. Youth A had a\nhealing scab on his right forearm and lower back. No medical treatment\nneeded.\n• Incident report dated 07/04/2022, completed by Staff 3. Youth A was upset\nbecause staff offered him a snack and it was not what he wanted. Youth A\nstarted to scream and throw things. Staff removed all the items out of Youth\nA’s room for his safety. Youth A escalated more and tried to stick himself with\na pencil. Staff took the pencil away. Supervisor talked to Youth A and calmed\nhim down.\n• Incident report dated 07/10/2022, completed by Staff 1. Youth A was\ntriggered because he lost his privilege to go offsite. Youth A was being\ndestructive by trying to break the heat vent and window. Staff 1 talked to\nYouth A and helped calm down.\n• Youth A treatment plan. Youth A has a history of aggressive behavior toward\nstaff and peers. When Youth A is triggered, he will punch, bit, push, throw and\nbreak things. Youth A has been reported to threaten adults who reprimand\nhim or redirect him by saying he will report them for abusing him.\n• Staff 1 employee file, No discipline reports\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(2) At a minimum, the behavior management system shall\ninclude all of the\nfollowing:\n(b) Positive intervention strategies to assist residents in\ndeveloping improved problem solving, self-management,\nand social skills.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule. Staff 1 admitted to grabbing\nYouth A by his left ankle to move him and prevent him from\ngrabbing a pencil because he thought Youth A might hurt\nhimself due to Youth A’s history of self-harming. This is not a\npositive intervention strategy.\nThere is insufficient evidence that the healing abrasion on Youth\nA’s arm was a result of Staff 1 grabbing Youth A by the ankle.\nYouth A alluded to the nurse that the abrasion was caused by\nstaff 1 when he pulled his leg. Youth A was unable to provide a\ntimeline for when the incident occurred and said this happened\nby accident. Staff 1 denied any prior knowledge that he caused\nthe abrasion. There were no witnesses, therefore it could not be\ndetermined that the healing abrasion was caused by Staff 1\ngrabbing the youth’s ankle.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2021C0219004 - intake 10/08/20; CAP approved 11/23/2020\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nOctober 17, 2022\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 24, 2022\n______________________________________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n6"
