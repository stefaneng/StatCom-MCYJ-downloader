The treatment plan either stated “progress-no” or\n“progress-some”. The intent of this rule is to assure that children\nin care are evaluated and receive the appropriate services to\nmeet their needs, that they are not in care longer than\nnecessary or the duration of the court order, and that they\nachieve timely permanence. A generic statement not outlining\nwhere the resident is in achieving the previous goal does not\nallow the reader to determine what services have been provided\nto the resident, based on the agency’s program statement, and\nhow far away or how close they are to achieving those goals. It\nwas discussed with the agency that the report needs to address\nthe services the resident has been receiving to accomplish the\ngoals as well as describe where the resident is at in completing\nthe action steps, specified by the time frames noted in the\nreports.\nR 400.4166 Discharge Plan\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional\ncare, all of the following:\n(d)Any services that will be provided by the facility after\ndischarge\nNone of the closed resident files provided a statement\nnoting whether services would be provided after\ndischarge or not.

The agency was\nunaware of the services that needed to be provided to the\nresidents under the abuse/neglect contract. Because of\nthis, they were not providing any statement in the\ndischarge plan because they did not believe it applied to\n13",
    "them. The agency will need to write a statement in the\ndischarge plan outlining the services they will provide or a\nstatement acknowledging that no services will be\nprovided.\nR 400.4144 A d m i s s i o n h e alth screening; physical examinations.\n(1) An initial health screening shall be completed for each\nresident within 24 hours of admission to a facility.\nThe agency medical policy was reviewed. No information was\ndocumented concerning an initial health screening. There were no\nforms in any of the open residential files noting an initial health\nassessment was completed. Information could be gathered from\nmultiple documents in the file that could collectively be an initial\nhealth screen. It was discussed to add Initial health screening in\nthe policy. A form may need to be created, depending on how the\npolicy is written.\nRFCAN Contract Oct 17: 2.10.d. page 13 Contractor\nResponsibilities-Services to be Provided-Staffing: The\nContractor shall designate individual(s) trained in making\ndecisions using the reasonable and prudent parent standard\nand who are authorized to consent to the youth's\nparticipation in activities. A designated individual(s) is to be\nonsite to exercise the reasonable and prudent parent\nstandard. The designated individual shall take reasonable\nsteps to determine the appropriateness of the activity in\nconsideration of the child's age, maturity, and developmental\nlevel. The designated individual(a) is to consult with social\nwork or treatment staff who are most familiar with the child at\nthe residential program in applying and using the reasonable\nand prudent parent standard.\nREASONABLE AND PRUDENT PARENT STANDARD: Foster\nchildren have the right to participate in age and\ndevelopmentally appropriate activities that are accepted as\nsuitable for children of the same chronological age or level of\nmaturity. The Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard is a\nstandard of decision making that allows a caregiver to make\nroutine parenting decisions regarding the participation in\nextracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities.\nThe standard is characterized by careful and sensible\nparental decisions that maintain a child's health, safety, and\nbest interests while encouraging the emotional and\ndevelopmental growth of the child. Caregivers may make\ncertain decisions, similar to daily decisions that a parent is\nexpected to make, regarding the child's participation in\nactivities without prior approval of the child’s caseworker, the\nlicensing or approval agency, or the juvenile court.\n14",
    "Employees are not being trained on the above standard. It was\ndiscussed that the supervisors of direct care workers could\ncomplete the training, and this would then be in compliance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nSIR-2017C0325009: The agency did not have policies on the staff members’\nroles in the school.\nThe agency created a policy outlining staff roles in the school.\nInterim 2017:\nR 400.4152: NO REPEATS\nR 400.4155 (3) (4): REPEAT VIOLATIONS\nR 400.4156 (2) (3): REPEAT VIOLATIONS\nR 400.4166 (1): REPEAT VIOLATIONS\nRFCAN 2.10.i.: REPEAT VIOLATIONS\nRFCAN 2.10.R: NO REPEATS\nThrough file review it was determined the agency has organized files, both with\nemployee records and residential files. The intake process for a resident is done well\nand all documentation is completed thoroughly. The agency also completes an\n“Admissions Assessment Form” which is detailed and helpful to any reader of the\nresident files. Treatment plans had excellent client centered goals and action steps.\nThrough interviews with residents and staff, it was clear services are being provided. All\nresidents reported they liked where they were placed and have been receiving help\nthrough the variety of services provided.\nIn the upcoming year, the agency will need to attend to report writing. Repeat violations\nwere cited in the initial treatment plans, updated treatment plans and discharge plans.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MSA requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n15",
