    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4144 Admission health screening; physical examinations.\n(1) An initial health screening shall be completed for each\nresident within 24 hours of admission to a facility.\nOne of three youth files reviewed did not have an admission health screening\ncompleted within 24 hours. The youth was admitted on 02/18/22 and the health\nscreening was completed on 02/21/22.\nR 400.4152 Initial documentation.\nAt the time of admission, all of the following shall be in the\nresident's case record:\n(i) Documentation that the grievance policy was provided\nas required in R 400.4132.\nOne of three youth files reviewed lacked documentation that the grievance policy\nwas provided to the youth.\n2.) This facility is non-contracted with Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices therefore, MISEP requirements are not applicable.\n3.) This facility is non-contracted with Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices, therefore, MDHHS Policy/MDHHS contract are not applicable.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Bethany Christian Services has four child caring institution licenses as well as\na child placing agency license. A youth transferred between different licenses,\nand some of the admission documentation was not completed as the youth\nwas not consider a new admission. The facility was informed that youth\ntransferring from one license to another needs to be treated as a brand-new\nadmission to the program and all licensing rules apply.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n Bethany Christian Services has come across some difficulties with local dental\noffices treating the youth timely due to insurance/payment issues. The facility\nwas informed to document their attempts and maintain any written\ncommunication to show efforts being made to schedule dental appointments.\n1",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility had one corrective action plan during this licensing period for the Renewal\nInspection completed February 4, 2021, for rule 400.4166 (1) Discharge plan. A\ncorrective action plan dated February 18, 2021, was approved that included\ncompleting a residential closing document being added to the discharge checklist.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator reported no barriers or systemic factors that have impacted\nrule compliance for the facility. COVID positive staff challenged the facility’s ability to\nstay in ratio, but the case manager helped cover shifts for the facility to stay in ratio.\nThe facility implemented independent outings into the community and helped the\nyouth create a resident council. The facility is renovating the lower level of the home\nto increase their capacity to care for 12 youth. An inspection report completed by the\nDepartment of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs was completed on February 16, 2022\noutlining what needed to be taken care of for final approval.\nInterviews\nI interviewed three youth during the onsite visit. The youth interviewed reported\nfeeling safe, having someone to talk to at the facility and working on independent\nliving skills. The youth were enrolled in school. I spoke with staff who reported\nfeeling supported in their job and enjoying their work. There were no concerns noted\nby youth or staff.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility continue on their regular license.\nMarch 15, 2022\n________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 16, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n2"
