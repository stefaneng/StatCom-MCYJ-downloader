    "summary": "The investigation found no definitive evidence that a staff member intentionally 'body-slammed' a youth during an altercation, as accounts differed on whether it was an attempted restraint that resulted in a fall. However, multiple witnesses, including other staff, confirmed that the staff member escalated the situation by approaching the youth in an aggressive manner and failing to use proper de-escalation techniques, which violated the facility's required policies and procedures. Therefore, while the facility was found compliant on the physical intervention allegation, it was found non-compliant for failing to follow its own program statement policies regarding care and supervision. The agency is culpable for a violation due to a staff member's inappropriate conduct that contravened established de-escalation protocols, necessitating a corrective action plan.",
