    "INVESTIGATION:\nAdministrator 1 and Administrator 2 were interviewed face-to-face at the\nfacility, on 7/21/22. They reported Youth A is lodged under the West Campus\nlicense and Staff 1 is employed under the East Campus license with the incident\ntaking place in the Lighthouse school which is located at the Kentwood license. The\nteacher in the classroom is not an employee of the Wedgwood programs. Staff 1 has\nbeen suspended and placed on leave while the investigation is ongoing. Both report\nunderstanding Staff 1 did not punch Youth A but spoke as if she would. A\n\"restorative\" meeting has taken place and Staff 1 apologized to Youth A.\nEducation Coordinator/Complainant was interviewed face-to-face at the facility\non 7/21/22. She reported being \"two rooms down\" in another classroom when she\noverheard an argument. She described the noise as loud voices arguing. She gave it\na minute before walking to the classroom the noise was coming from. When she\nwent into the classroom, she observed Staff 1 and Youth A arguing. Each were\ntelling the other to \"shut up and stop talking to me\". Staff 1 told Youth A to respect\nher because she was the adult, and both began to use aggressive words with Youth\nA saying he would beat other ups and Staff 1 responding with something like \"when I\npunch you in your chest\". Neither stood up and as Youth A was removed from the\nroom, Staff 1 continued with challenging words towards him. She believes, Staff 1\nwas escalating the situation and never engaged in calm or therapeutic conversation\nwith Youth A. She also reported speaking to Staff 1 about the incident later in the\nday and Staff 1 was surprised at what she is reported to have said. Education\nCoordinator/Complainant believes, Staff 1 appears to have lost control of her\nemotions during the moment.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/21/22. He reported\nbeing present the day of the incident but does not remember \"anything like\" the\nallegations.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/21/22. He reported\nbeing present the day of the incident but \"didn't see or hear anything\".\nYouth D was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/21/22. He denied being\npresent in the classroom at the time of the incident.\nYouth E was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/21/22. He reported\nbeing present during the incident and hearing a lot of yelling. He believes it started\nbetween Youth A and Youth F with Staff 1 observing the classroom at the time. Staff\n1 questioned Youth A about being aggressive and began to argue with Youth A.\nStaff 1 told Youth A to leave her classroom and not speak to her. Youth E never\nheard treats of violence but believed Staff 1 was not listening and Youth A was not in\nthe wrong.",
    "Youth F, Youth G, and Youth H were interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n7/21/22, separately. They all reported being present in the classroom at the time of\nthe incident but denied hearing any arguing.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/21/22. He reported the\nincident began when he was speaking with a peer, and both were laughing when\nYouth C told them to stop talking. Youth A told Youth C to say it out loud and not\nunder his breath. He also reported Staff 1 became engaged and stated, \"don't worry\nabout it because I can fight\" just before she told him she would punch him in the\nchest. He responded with \"bitch you ain't going to do shit\". Staff 1 continued to talk\nto him as he left the classroom.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/21/22. She reported being\nin another classroom when the incident began and leaving her classroom to\ninvestigate the yelling she heard. She wanted to see if someone needed help and\nshe heard Youth A yelling and Staff 1 saying \"you think your tough\". Staff 2\npositioned herself between Youth A and Staff 1 and told Youth A to leave the room.\nStaff 2 also reported as Youth A was leaving the room Staff 1 continued to say\nthings like \"you think your tough\" in a very disrespectful way. As Youth A was\nleaving, he stood in the doorway threatening Staff 1 and Staff 1 stood up and started\nto move towards him, so Staff 2 got Youth A outside and shut the door. Staff 1\nopened the door twice with the second time to come out and use the restroom.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/21/22. She reported being\nin the classroom during the incident and Staff 1 responded to Youth A saying\nsomething. Staff 1 responded with \"who do you think your talking to”, and more\nwords exchanged but neither moved from their seats. Staff 3 was unclear about the\nspecific words Staff 1 used but it was said loudly and something like punching Youth\nA. Staff 1 did nothing to deescalate Youth A. She also reported Staff 1 tends to\n\"always pick up the rope\" which means she does not let things go when she arguers\nwith a youth. Staff 1 always tries to let youth know she is not scared of them and\nwants them to know she could do something but will not.\nTeacher was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 7/21/22. She reported not\nhearing what Youth A said to Staff 1 but she reported hearing Staff 1 respond by\ntelling Youth A it was disrespectful and began to yell at Youth A. They were yelling\nback and forth when Youth A swore at Staff 1 and Staff 1 responded by telling him\nshe was going to punch him in the stomach or gut. Teacher also reported at this\npoint, Youth E started to argue with Staff 1, and she argued back. Teacher was\nunable to recall what was specifically said. Teacher gave her description of Staff 1\nsince she has had numerous interactions with her. Staff 1 wants to be one of the\nkids and be at their level. Arguing with youth is not uncommon for her.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via video telephone on 7/22/22. She reported Youth A\nand another youth were talking and they began to argue and threaten to fight each\nother. She told Youth A \"not to come into the classroom and drain the energy\".",
    "Youth A responded with \"bitch don't talk to me because I will go off the rails\". Staff 1\nreported meeting Youth A at the same level and told him to calm down because no\none is scared of him. Youth A then told her he could beat up everyone. She\nresponded by telling him she was going to \"knock some sense into him\". Youth A\nwas removed from the room while Staff 1 was still talking to him. She also reported\nspeaking to the \"School Supervisor\" and stating that she was alright but could have\nhandled the situation differently. She denied saying she would punch Youth A but\nsaid she would knock sense into him as a figure of speech. She agreed she said\nthings she should not have said. She believed Youth A was being disruptive in the\nclassroom and wanted him to try a different classroom. She also believed she was\ngetting the message that he \"needs to respect and not threaten others\".\nDocuments Reviewed:\nSuitable Treatment and Freedom of Movement Procedures dated 4/13/18. This\ndocument outlines the treatment of youth in the program. It begins with the\nstatement \"treatment with dignity and respect\" and also states, \"treatment without\nemotional harm to youth\".

Documentation in the file indicates Staff\n1 received a \"verbal warning on 5/2/22 for being late to work on three days\nbeginning with Tuesday 4/26, Wednesday 4/27, and Friday 4/28. The expectation is\nStaff 1 will incur no future tardy days to work. The other disciplinary action in the file\nis Staff 1's termination from employment due to her actions occurring in the\nallegations in this investigation.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\n(1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow\nwritten policies and procedures that prohibit the following\nforms of intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(iv) Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a\nyouth’s background or appearance or mental state.
