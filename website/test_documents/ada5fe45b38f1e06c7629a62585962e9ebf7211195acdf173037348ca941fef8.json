DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Variance- The agency was advised to contact their accreditation authority,\nCouncil On Accreditation (COA) or Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)\nregarding a variance for some of their rules that are stricter that DCWL rules for\nfoster homes. If a variance is not approved by COA or ORR, a variance for\nDCWL rules will be considered.\n• Annual foster home evaluations need to be completed by the renewal date of the\noff year. For example, if the license expires 9/4/24, the annual is due by 9/4/23.\n• Special Evaluations- Documents related to the Special Evaluations must be\nuploaded to the document section of CWLM. This includes items required by rule\n327, such as notifications to foster care worker and foster parents.\n• Employee files- A copy of the job description must be located in the file. An\nacknowledgment by the worker that they have viewed the job description does\nnot meet this requirement.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• None requested.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during\nthis period under review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed on-site. The\nChief Administrator (CA) reported the agency is still very involved in addressing\nCOVID with the refugee population they serve. Positive cases and isolation\ncontinue to affect some timelines to complete tasks with youth. The agency\ncontinues to use phone, email, and video chat, to complete some tasks as they\nare able. The CA also identified a barrier with providing medical care to youth, due\nto the type of insurance they have. There are limited providers that accept their\ninsurance. Therefore, scheduling appointments has been difficult. In addition,\nmany youth are teenagers or young adults and sometimes forget or refuse to\nattend appointments. Another area that has been challenging is staffing shortage.\nCases have been reassigned in order to maintain compliance. However, turnover\nhas created some difficulty in meeting required timeframes. The CA also noted\nthere has been a delay with court, due to immigration attorney reassignments and\nspecial findings orders. This is an ongoing issue due to federal changes regarding\nimmigration. Despite these challenges, the CA indicated the agency is working\nhard to maintain compliance. The agency did not have a Corrective Action Plan\nfrom the 2022 review. However, they continue to utilize previous activities that\nhave assisted in maintaining compliance. A quality improvement team meets\nmonthly to discuss solutions to barriers. The Unaccompanied Refugee Minor team\nmeets bi-weekly to review case compliance. Trainings are occurring frequently\nwith staff to ensure everyone is updated on changing policies.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nOne staff was interviewed on-site. They reported being satisfied with their position\nat the agency. Their supervisor is supportive, hard-working and helpful. There\nwere no concerns reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in an office building in Lansing. The office\nhas adequate space for staff to work or meet with clients. There is sufficient locked\nstorage for files and sensitive information.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNot applicable. This is a non-contracted facility.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes. It is recommended that the agency be issued a renewal of their\nregular license.\n_ __________August 29, 2023__________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 29, 2023\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
