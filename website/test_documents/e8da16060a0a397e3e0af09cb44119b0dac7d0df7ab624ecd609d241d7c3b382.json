They advised that the supervisor named in\nthis complaint, Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) 1 is no longer\nemployed with the agency as of March 2024.

The\ncourt order was signed 9/1/2023.\nSection Manager reported FCW 2 is on medical leave but FCW 1\nand FCS 2 are available to speak with me about the allegations.\n2",
    "FCW 1: I interviewed FCW 1 by telephone on 7/15/2024. FCW 1\ndenied ever threatening the child or birth mother. She affirmed\nSection Manager’s reporting related to her obtaining a PPO and\nthe case being transferred from her and why. She reported there\nwas no threat to the birth mother by her, FCS 1 or anyone. She\nreported the threats were from the birth mother toward her. The\nbirth mother was very confrontational and was making threats to\nher via email. FCW 1 said she went on medical leave from\n5/20/2023 and when she returned on 11/20/2023 the case was\nclosed.\nFCS 2: I interviewed FCS 2 by telephone on 7/18/2024. She was\nnot aware of any threats to the foster child or birth mother by any\nfoster care staff. She affirmed staff’s assignment of the case as\nreported by Section Manager. She reported both FCW 2 and FCW\n3 are on leave of absence now and this case was closed out in\nSeptember 2023 due the judge giving full custody to the birth\nfather who had placement of Child A.\nFCS 2 reported when the child’s case was under her supervision,\nshe primarily had the contacts with the birth mother due to the\nbirth mother’s making threats to workers. She reported during her\ncontacts with the birth mother, the birth mother would bring up\nFCW 1. Such as FCW 1 did not like her, or FCW 1 did not provide\nher services, but never that FCW 1 threatened her, or threatened\nto harm Child A.\nDocumentation Review:\nChild A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• Child A entered care on 9/8/2020 and was placed with her\nnonrespondent legal father on 9/3/2021.\n• A DHS-69 Foster Care Action Summary dated 9/12/2023\ncompleted by FCW 3 that showed Child A’s foster care\ncase closure for an 8/10/2023 effective date.\nAnalysis Based on information from interviews and documentation\nreviewed, the evidence does not substantiate the allegations or a\nlack of responsible character by the staff suitable and able to meet\nthe needs of children and families served by the agency.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nRule Code Privacy safeguard\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12211\nSection (1) An agency shall safeguard the privacy of a child and his or her\nDescription family.\n3",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The worker gave confidential information about the birth mother,\nsuch as social security number, to other people outside the\nagency.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant: I made several attempts to reach the Complainant\nfor an interview without success.

Section\nManager reported Child A was already placed in the legal father’s\nhome and on 8/10/2023 the court legally ordered that placement.\nThat court order was signed 9/1/2023.\nNeither Chief Administrator nor Section Manager were aware of\nconfidential information related to the birth parents or this case\nbeing inappropriately shared.\nFCW 1: I interviewed FCW 1 by telephone on 7/15/2024. FCW 1\ndenied the allegation. She reported no contact with the birth\nmother since sometime in May 2023 prior to her medical leave on\n5/20/2023. She reported there were no reports or documents that\nshe would have written to anyone or provided to service providers\nthat would have contained the birth mother’s social security\nnumber or protective confidential information.\nFCS 2: I interviewed FCS 2 by telephone on 7/18/2024. She was\nnot aware of confidential information, such as social security\nnumbers related to the birth mother being released or provided to\nanyone inappropriately.\n4",
    "Analysis Based on information from interviews the evidence does not\nsubstantiate the allegation or that the privacy of the child and his\nor her family was not safeguarded.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nIV.
