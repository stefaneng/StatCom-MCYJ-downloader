Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nFacility has not submitted records to MDHHS for permanent retention one year\nfollowing the final order of adoption as required.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/20/2022 I was assigned to investigate allegations submitted by Complainant\nthrough the DCWL on-line compliant form. Complainant stated that 53 closed\nadoption files were identified for which the licensee has not submitted the finalized\nadoption files to MDHHS for permanent retention one year following the finalization\norder.\n2",
    "On 5/24/2022 I requested a list of the 53 case names from the complainant, which I\nreceived through email the same day. Additionally, I asked the complainant to verify\nif all 53 files were associated with the LAS-Lansing license, to which she responded\nthat she did not know to which license each file was attached; therefore, all 53 files\nare addressed within this report.\nINTERVIEWS\nOn 6/2/2022 I conducted an on-site visit, viewed the storage of closed adoption files\nand interviewed Supervisor A.\nSupervisor A reported each satellite office maintains their own closed adoption files\nand they are currently working on establishing a uniform method of documenting and\ndisseminating closed adoption files as the method they were previously using was\nnot effective. Supervisor A reported there were plans to bring several files to local\noffices prior to the statewide stay-at-home order in 2020 and now that they are back\nin the office, they are working to get the files to the local offices as required. She\nreported she is in the process of boxing up all closed adoption files and labelling\neach box with the year and month of the finalization as well as the month and year\nthe files must be sent/brought to the applicable local office. She showed me the\nboxes which were labelled as indicated. She stated that, as she boxes up the files,\nshe is making note of any files that are overdue for transport to local offices and I will\nbe provided with that list once she is completed.\nOn 6/24/22 I held a virtual meeting with Chief Administrator, Program Manager 1,\nand Program Manager 2.\nChief Administrator 1 reported Lutheran Adoption Services is currently undergoing\nan effort statewide to develop a uniform procedure for tracking and distributing\nfinalized adoption files in order to achieve and maintain compliance in each office.\nChief Administrator 1 reported compliance has been a challenge due to Lutheran\nAdoption Services having offices throughout the state of Michigan and the tight\ntimeframe of bringing files to local offices between the 12-13th month following\nfinalization can present challenges if the office who provided the adoption service is\nlocated several hours from the county DHHS where the file must be brought.\nProgram Manager 1, who works under the LAS-Lansing license, reported that she\ncompiled information about the 53 cases named by the complainant. She stated that\nsome of the files were not located in the agency database, so it is believed these\nwere identified as being Lutheran Adoption Services cases in error. Program\nManager 1 stated she was able to identify to which office each of the applicable files\nbelonged and where those files were in the process of being returned to the local\noffices. Program Manager 1 reported that the staff member who was responsible for\nthe tracking of finalized adoption files went on leave after which she passed away.\nSince that time, they have continued to struggle with low staffing. Additionally, some\ncounty local offices have not always been receptive to receiving the finalized\n3",
    "adoption files as they have reported either not having the staff or space to take the\nfiles.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nOn 6/10/2022 I received and reviewed a spreadsheet from Program Manager 1\nidentifying the following information about each of the 53 cases named in the\ncomplaint:\n1.

Of those 27, 22 were not delivered to the\napplicable local office within the required timeframe.\nOn 6/21/2022 I completed a review of the files of Youth’s D and AAA in MiSACWIS\nand determined that neither case was managed by either of the Lutheran Adoption\nServices licenses.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nADM 1030 Disposition of Records for MDHHS Supervised Children\nFor both MDHHS and contracted adoption agency cases, the\nlocal MDHHS office or contracted agency must retain all\nadoption case records for one year after finalization of the\nadoption. One year (between 12-13 months) past the adoption\nfinalization date, a contracted adoption agency must send the\noriginal record to the local MDHHS office; copies must not be\nmaintained by the contracted adoption agency; see licensing\nrule R400.12713-Adoption Placement Record.\nANALYSIS: The licensee is in violation as 22 files were not sent to the local\nMDHHS office between 12-13 months of finalization.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n5",

RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change in the license status.\nJune 27, 2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
