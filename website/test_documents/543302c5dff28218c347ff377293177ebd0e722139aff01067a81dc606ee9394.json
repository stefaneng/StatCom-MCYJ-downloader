She\nreported she received all her information about the case from\nwatching social media. She did not have any first-hand\ninformation. No additional information was added.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed on 1/23/25, via\nvideo conference and face-to-face on 2/18/25. She reported\nCatholic Charities Southeast Michigan (CCSEM) did not hold the\nfoster care portion of Adoptive Child A’s case. This was managed\nby Oakland County DHHS. She reported on 9/21/17, an Order of\nAdoption for Adoptive Child A was signed by Wayne County\nCourt. CA reported Foster Parent of Adoptive Child A became a\ngeneral licensed foster parent with CCSEM on 4/27/18. At this\ntime, Foster Parent was already the Adoptive Mother of Adoptive\nChild A, who is her granddaughter. CCSEM had no assigned\nresponsibility for Adoptive Child A per Licensing Rules for Child\nPlacing Agencies.\nFoster Parent is the adoptive mother to Adoptive Child A and will\nbe referred to as Foster Parent from here on.\nCA reported the last placement from CCSEM into Foster Parent’s\nhome was Foster Child A (FCA).

CA said upon receiving the information that\nAdoptive Child A was missing, the agency discussed this news\nwith their administrative staff and reviewed the foster home rules\nto make sure every foster home rule was followed regarding their\nrole under the rules. She said it was determined based on a\nreview of MiSACWIS history, DHHS policy and Child Placing\nAgency rules that there was no established policy or rule for the\nagency to follow or act on. Adoptive Child A was not an active\nfoster child, thus foster care protocols did not apply.\nCA reported there is currently an active investigation on the Foster\nParent with CCSEM, in conjunction with MDHHS.\nCA reported CCSEM has had no knowledge or awareness of\nPerpetrator, including his connection to the family or concerns\ntowards Adoptive Child A’s safety or her alleged relationship with\nhim.

LS spoke with Foster Parent about\nAdoptive Child A’s disappearance. Foster Parent reported she\nwent to the school to see if the school knew anything about\nAdoptive Child A’s disappearance or her where abouts and the\nschool called the Detroit Police Department (DPD). LS said Foster\nParent waited at the school to speak with DPD and shared that\nAdoptive Child A did not come home on 1/9/24 nor called Foster\nParent, and she has never done this in the past.\nThe agency did not receive any updates from the law enforcement\ninvestigation, and it is unknown when their investigation began\npertaining to the criminal involvement. MDHHS began their\ninvestigation approximately on 1/12/2025 pertaining to the\nallegations of abuse or neglect by Foster Parent.\nLS reported upon the case becoming public knowledge that\nAdoptive Child A was presumed deceased the agency again\nreviewed Child Placing Agency Rules to determine their agency’s\n3",
    "compliance. LS reported when the information became public\nknowledge on social media, a contact was received by MDHHS\nasking if Foster Parent was still licensed with CCSEM and if\nFoster Parent had any children placed in her home. LS reported\nthat the MDHHS representative was informed that Foster Parent\nwas still licensed with the agency and no children were placed in\nher home.

She reported she was looking\nin MiSACWIS and saw that an investigation was initiated on\nFoster Parent by MDHHS. PM reported LS reached out to the\nassigned Lead MDHHS Worker upon learning of an investigation\nof Foster Parent that was initiated in MiSACWIS. The Lead\nMDHHS Worker shared with PM that she was a new worker and\nwas recently assigned to conduct the investigation on Foster\nParent regarding the disappearance of Adoptive Child A and any\ninvolvement Foster Parent may have had in this disappearance.\nThe Lead MDHHS Worker explained to PM she did not know she\nwas to contact the private agency and inform them an active\ninvestigation was opened on Foster Parent.\nPM reported the Lead MDHHS Worker had not yet made a\ndetermination of abuse or neglect regarding Foster Parent based\non information learned at that time.\nLicensing Worker (LW) was interviewed on 3/24/25, via\ntelephone. LW has been working with Foster Parent since Foster\nParent’s home was licensed with CCSEM on 4/27/18. She\nreported when she went to the home of Foster Parent on 9/24/24,\nshe discussed with Foster Parent about the completion of a\nmissing person report for Adoptive Child A. Foster Parent said she\nhad completed the report on 1/10/24 because she thought she\nhad to wait 24 hours to report a missing person. LW reported\nFoster Parent reported Adoptive Child A had never been late\nreturning home from school, nor had she indicated that Adoptive\nChild A had ran away from home in the past. LW reported Foster\nParent then told her she believes that Adoptive Child A had ran\naway and has not contacted her to discuss her where abouts. LW\nreported she advised Foster Parent to maintain open\n4",
    "communication with the local police department regarding\nAdoptive Child A’s disappearance and to keep the agency abreast\nto any information or changes regarding Adoptive Child A.\nLW reported during the last year's home assessment, the home\nremained clean and maintained, and she did not observe any\nsafety issues in the home. LW reported at no time did Foster\nParent discuss with her that she knew the Perpetrator and that\nany allegations of abuse/neglect ever occurred in her home. LW\nreported the only thing Foster Parent said to her was Adoptive\nChild A was missing, she believed she had run away and she was\nvery worried about Adoptive Child A’s disappearance. Foster\nParent A reported to LW that Adoptive Child A disappeared on\n1/9/24. However, Foster Parent did not share this information with\nCCSEM until LW went to the home to complete a home visit for\nthe upcoming renewal on 2/14/24.\nFoster Parent was interviewed on 3/24/25 via telephone. She\nreported there has never been abuse/neglect in her home and her\nadoptive children were well taken care of. She reported she had\nno knowledge of Perpetrator’s involvement of any criminal sexual\nconduct (CSC). She reported she never gave Adoptive Child A\npermission to go anywhere with Perpetrator. She said this\ndecision was made by Foster Parent’s Daughter. Foster Parent\nreported Perpetrator never came into her home and she did not\nhave a relationship with him. Foster Parent reported when LW\ncame to her home on 2/14/25 and she shared with LW that\nAdoptive Child A went missing on 1/9/24. Foster Parent said she\nnever shared anything with CCSEM regarding Perpetrator\nbecause she did not know him and did not have any type of\nrelationship with him.\nFoster Parent Daughter was interviewed on 3/24/25, via\ntelephone. She reported she is the daughter of Foster Parent.\nFoster Parent Daughter reported she had a long-standing\nrelationship with Perpetrator and produced five children. She\nreported the only information she had regarding Perpetrator’s\ncriminal history that came from Perpetrator was that he spent time\nin jail for carrying a concealed weapon and had a gun charge.\nShe reported prior to that, when she got pregnant with her first\nchild at nineteen years old, her aunt took her to get a pregnancy\ntest and asked her if she knew Perpetrator. She reported she told\nher aunt that Perpetrator told her he had a gun charge. She said\nher aunt told her when the two of them returned home, she was\ngoing to look Perpetrator up on the website. Foster Parent\nDaughter said her aunt told her that Perpetrator had an Criminal\n5",
    "Sexual Conduct (CSC) charge. She said she mentioned this\ninformation to Perpetrator, and he told her he was dating a person\nwho lied about her age, and nothing occurred with the CSC\nincident. Foster Parent Daughter reported she never told anyone\nabout the discussion she had with Perpetrator about his CSC\ncharge. She said Perpetrator denied he had a charge with CSC,\nand she believed him. She said the two of them never mentioned\nan allegation of CSC again. She reported she has had an eleven-\nyear relationship with the Perpetrator off and on and to her\nknowledge, he had not had any contact with young girls. She said\nhe had a lot of female relationships during their courtship. She\nreported she was not married to him, and he dated other women\nand there was nothing she could do about it.\nFoster Parent Daughter reported she never lived with Foster\nParent during the time she was dating Perpetrator, but she spoke\nwith Foster Parent often and occasionally visited Foster Parent in\nher home. She reported Perpetrator had a car shop and he asked\nif any of the children wanted to make some money by cleaning up\nthe shop. She said she told him their eleven-year-old daughter\nthey had together could clean the shop with her cousin, Adoptive\nChild A. She said she called Foster Parent and asked for\npermission for Adoptive Child A to help clean up the shop with her\ncousin and she was granted permission from Foster Parent due to\nFoster Parent Daughter knowing Perpetrator and Perpetrator was\nthe father of Foster Parent Daughter’s eleven-year-old daughter.\nFoster Parent Daughter reported at no time did Perpetrator go into\nFoster Parent’s home.

No information,\nincluding a telephone number was provided for her.\n6",
