Administrator 1\nreported Staff 1 oversees inventory for youth in the program. Staff\n1 will document if youth need clothing and fulfil that need. She\ncompletes this responsibility weekly.\nYouth A was interviewed on 1/22/25. I observed Youth A and her\nclothes fit well. Youth A reported she needed two sweaters, one\npair of shorts, and one pair of sweatpants. Youth A reported she\ncompleted an inventory sheet a week ago expressing this need.\nYouth A reported her clothing is too big. Youth A reported the staff\ngave her size XL and this was too big for her. Youth A reported\nshe wanted a different size.\nYouth B was interviewed on 2/10/25. Youth B reported a week\nago she did not have enough clothes but was provided clothing a\ncouple days ago. Youth B reported she was missing two sweaters,\ntwo shorts, and one t-shirt. Youth B reported she completed an\ninventory sheet, and the agency did not provide her with the\nclothes that she requested right away. Youth B reported that every\nSunday the group completes inventory and lays their clothing on\nthe bed. Staff go around and check to see if they need anything.\nYouth B reported on Monday’s Staff 1 comes around and gives\n2",
    "clothing. Youth A did not express that anyone refused to give her\nclothes, just that it took too long.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 1/22/25. Staff 1 reported she oversees\nintakes and inventory for all youth. Staff 1 reported each youth\nreceives a specific amount of each clothing item. This is outlined\non the inventory sheet. Staff 1 reported the youth complete their\ninventory sheets and each Monday she comes to the unit and\nlooks at their forms and clothing to ensure what they are\nrequesting is needed. Staff 1 reported Youth A requested one pair\nof shorts and one sweatshirt on 1/13/25. These items were\nbrought to her, but she refused them due Youth A wanting a size\ntoo small.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via telephone on 1/27/25.\nSupervisor 1 reported Staff 1 comes weekly to the units to check\ninventory of all youth. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 sits with each\nyouth and goes over the form and looks at their clothing.\nSupervisor 1 reported Staff 1 will give clothing when it is needed.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A was given clothing items but did\nnot want them because she wanted a smaller size. Supervisor 1\nreported the size she wanted was too small. Supervisor 1 reported\nYouth B has never reported to her that she didn’t have enough\nclothing.\nDocuments:\n• Staff 1 and I reviewed the inventory sheets for Youth A for\nthe month of December 2024 and January 2025. We\nlooked at inventory for 12/19/24. Youth A had requested\nclothing items. There are no documents stating she\nreceived those until 1/13/25. Youth B did not have an\ninventory sheet.\n• I reviewed the inventory sheet. Youth are to receive four\neach of sweatshirts and sweatpants; five each of shorts;\nand six each of t-shirts.\n• I reviewed the Intakes and Personnel Items policy. The\nagency is to provide items at intake and the “warehouse”\nwill fill immediately if youth are missing items.\nTour Observation:\n• On 1/22/25, I observed the warehouse that stores the\nclothing items. The agency has an abundance of clothing\nitems.\n• I went into the unit on 2/10/25 and looked at all the youth’s\nclothing to ensure all youth had the allotted clothing. All\n3",
    "youth had at least the minimal clothing allotment, if not\nmore.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Youth A and Youth B both\nhad enough clothing and the clothing fit. Youth A had refused\nclothing due to wanting to wear a smaller size. The agency\ndetermined the smaller size would not fit her and offered her the\nappropriate size. Youth B’s request for clothing was given to her\nwithin a week.\nTechnical Assistance:\nStaff 1 was not documenting on the inventory sheets when she\ndetermined the request from the youth did not warrant more\nclothes. Leaving this blank on the inventory sheets, made it\nappear that the youth were not given items they needed. Youth\nA’s inventory appeared as if she had not been given clothes for\nalmost a month. Technical assistance was provided that the\nagency note why items were not given and note when items were\ngiven. If the agency notes the youth did not receive items\nrequested, the reason the request was denied is to be noted.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nDescription service policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was not seen by a nurse when she smashed her finger.\nOn 1/14/25 she asked to be seen by the nurse for her finger and\nthe facility refused.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAll interviews were completed at the facility unless otherwise\nstated.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed on 1/22/25. Administrator 1\nreported that all youth who need medical can fill out a form and\nplace in the medical drop box. The nurse will then read the form\nand see the youth to assess.\nYouth A was interviewed on 1/22/25. Youth A reported she asked\nstaff to put a “note” into the nurse so that she can have her finger\nassessed. Youth A reported she hurt her finger at a different\n4",
    "facility and now it looked like her nail was coming out. Youth A\nreported the staff refused to create the note for her. Youth A did\nnot mention specific staff. Youth A reported she does have access\nto medical request documents. Youth A reported those documents\ncan be filled out and dropped into the medical box. Youth A\nreported she did not complete one. Youth A reported she felt this\nwas a medical emergency, so she told the supervisor instead of\nfilling out a paper. Youth A reported she did end up seeing the\nnurse and then was taken to urgent care. Urgent care couldn’t do\nanything, so they left.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via telephone on 1/27/25.\nSupervisor 1 reported she is unaware of anyone refusing any\nyouth medical care. Supervisor 1 reported a youth has access to\nmedical requests documents. They are to fill them out and place\nthem into the medical box. Supervisor 1 reported the nurse will\ncome and see the youth after she reads the form.\nNurse 1 was interviewed on 2/10/25. Nurse 1 reported as soon as\nshe was made aware that Youth A requested medical attention\nshe saw her. Nurse 1 reported she had slammed her finger in a\ndoor at her previous placement. Youth A’s nail was lifting off of the\nnail bed. Nurse 1 reported she sent her to urgent care and urgent\ncare refused to see her. Nurse 1 reported urgent care did not\nprovide a reason why but provided her with a document stating\nthey didn’t see her. Nurse 1 reported she contacted the manager\nat the urgent care and Youth A went back to urgent care and was\nseen.\nDocuments:\n• I reviewed the case note completed by Nurse 1 dated\n1/14/25. Nurse 1 assessed Youth A and requested her be\nsent out to urgent care. Youth A had requested medical on\n1/13/25.\n• I reviewed the document from the Covenant MedExpress in\nFrankenmuth. The letter reported Youth A was “brought in\nbut not seen.”\n• I reviewed the After Visit summary dated 1/16/25 for Youth\nA. On 1/16/25 she was seen at the Covenant MedExpress\nat Frankenmuth. Manage pain and swelling was\nrecommended.\n• I reviewed the Health and Dental policy. The policy does\nnot outline how youth are to be seen by the medical team,\nbut does state the “staff and clients of the program are\noriented to the methods of accessing health, medical,\ndental, and clinical services…”\n5",
    "Analysis The agency is compliant with this rule. The procedure verbalized\nby Youth A, Supervisor 1, and Administrator 1 was not followed by\nYouth A. All reported a medical request is to be completed and\nplaced in the medical box. Nurse 1 notes reported she requested\nto see her on 1/13/25 but did not complete a medical request.\nYouth A was seen after she filed a complaint with the Division of\nChild Welfare Licensing. This complaint was filed on 1/14/25 at\n8:03am. She was seen at 1:10pm on 1/14/25. Youth A did not fill\nout a medical request though. Policy states that all youth are\noriented to the method of receiving health services and through\ninterviews it was determined Youth A did know this procedure, but\ndid not follow this procedure.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was provided for the Health and Dental\npolicy to be updated as it currently states all youth are oriented to\nthe procedure for receiving health care but does not outline what\nthat procedure is. The agency needs to outline the procedure of\nreceiving health care.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n2/28/25\n___________________________________\nVenus M.

    "summary": "The investigation addressed allegations of inadequate clothing and denied medical care at a youth facility. Investigators found the facility had sufficient clothing and proper procedures for both clothing requests and medical access, though documentation and policy clarity needed improvement. Youth A's clothing issue stemmed from a preference for a smaller size than recommended, and her medical care was delayed because she did not follow the correct request procedure, not due to staff refusal. Overall, no policy violations were substantiated, and culpability for the alleged failures was not found on the part of the facility.",
