He stated this occurred\nfor a minute or so, and staff did not appear to notice despite sitting\nnearby. Youth C recalled Youth A and Youth D being quiet while\nthis was occurring.

Youth D recalled\nthere being rules in the facility about youth not touching each\nother in any manner. She also stated there were not any rules\nabout youth sitting next to each other.

Over the course of about two minutes both\nYouth A and Youth D could be seen reaching under the\ntable to touch the other. It did not appear they were able to\ndo so underneath their clothing as the arm movements of\nboth youths were quick and not demonstrative, and it did\nnot appear that their clothing moved around.

This documentation is provided to youth at\nthe time of placement and stated that “there must be no\nphysical contact among residents.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews, documentation and video reviewed. There was no\nevidence found that staff were not providing supervision of the\nyouth as described in the rule.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility is advised to use this incident as training\nmaterial regarding staff supervision of youth, focusing on\nadherence to expectations provided to youth, placement of\nyouth or sitting areas to help reduce the chance of youth’s\n4",
