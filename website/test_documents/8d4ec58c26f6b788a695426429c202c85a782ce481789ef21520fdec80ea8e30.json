    "Youth A was released from Wayne County Juvenile Detention and\ndid not have asthma issues when he was there.\nYouth A was interviewed on 11/13/2024 at Wayne County\nJuvenile Detention. Youth A was asked about having asthma.\nYouth A stated he has asthma and does not currently have access\nto an inhaler.

Doctor stated youth with well controlled\nasthma will be prescribed albuterol nebulizer for as needed use\nand youth with active asthma will be prescribed albuterol nebulizer\nfor use at prescribed times.\nDocumentation\n• 11/04/2024 Youth A was admitted to Wayne County\nJuvenile Detention. Youth A’s initial nursing assessment\nwas completed. It does not document Youth A has asthma\nor has an asthma inhaler.\n• 11/12/2024 Youth A’s physical exam was completed. Youth\nA’s assessment states asthma and “albuterol neb” is written\nfor plan.\n• Youth A’s medication administration record lists “albuterol\nneb” as needed every 4-6 hours with a start date of\n11/13/2024. The medication administration record is blank\nfrom 11/13/2024 to 11/30/2024 for albuterol neb.\n• Wayne County Juvenile Detention policy and procedure\n17.12 Use of Pharmaceuticals states youth arriving with\nmedication may have their medications continued with the\napproval of the responsible doctor. The reason and\nduration of the treatment must be documented in the\nyouth’s chart by the doctor. It further states the medication\n4",
    "must be in the original medication bottle with the name of\nthe prescribing doctor and telephone number and the name\nof the pharmacy for the medication to be verified.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as documentation indicated\nYouth A was assessed for asthma, prescribed, and was offered\nasthma medication.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nClear documentation for as needed medication is required to\nverify that it was offered. Nurse initials on medication\nadministration record for as needed medication indicates the as\nneeded medication was offered, dispensed and taken. Another\nnotation, such as “D” for decline on the medication administration\nrecord, would indicate the as needed medication was offered and\ndeclined by the youth. Leaving as needed medication blank on the\nmedication administration record makes it impossible to determine\nif the as needed medication was not needed, not offered or\ndeclined.\nCONSULTATION\nRescue inhalers if prescribed are to be available for immediate\nuse when needed. Rescue inhalers may be kept in the nursing\nmedication room, however, rescue inhalers kept in a secure and\nlocked area on the unit or in an agency issued fanny pack for staff\nto carry at all times may facilitate faster access and be a lifesaving\nresponse.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n1/21/2025\n______________________________________\nVivian D Malleck Date\nLicensing Consultant\n5",
