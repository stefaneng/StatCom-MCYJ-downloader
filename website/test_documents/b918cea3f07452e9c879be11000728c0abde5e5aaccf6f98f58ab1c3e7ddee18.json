On 5/2/2022, Foster Parent A’s home was\nobserved to have unsuitable conditions for a foster home: including animal feces and\nfood on the floor, urine odor throughout, missing ceiling tiles and a broken door; as\nwell as flies and dirty dishes in the kitchen, and clothes piled up. There is a concern\nthe agency was aware of these foster home concerns and had not appropriately\naddressed them.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/11/2022 I reviewed the complaint; and on 5/12/2022 I spoke with the\ncomplainant by telephone.",
    "Complainant\nDuring my 5/12/2022 telephone interview with the Complainant, the Complainant\nprovided a history on how she and the department came to have contact with Foster\nParent A’s home. The Complainant reported that Administrator 0 reached out to\nDistrict Manager/Deputy Director X related to concerns with Foster Parent A’s home;\nand the agency’s licensing department looking to do revocation of the foster home’s\nlicense. While the department was exploring the matter, District Manager/Deputy\nDirector X recalled that Child B had been placed in Foster Parent A’s home and\nChild B was replaced because it was determined the home was not appropriate for\nhim. This realization led the department to check Child C’s (who remains placed in\nFoster Home A) and the foster home’s files. They saw that there were minimum\nsocial work contacts listed; and what was there was not addressing conditions of the\nhome. The department questioned, that if this home was not appropriate for Child B,\nhow could it be for Child C, especially given the fact the department was paying a\nhigh difficulty of care rate to Foster Parent A for Child C’s care. Additionally, there\nwere some rejected and unrejected complaints which had come in related to the\nfoster home. All those things, coupled with the agency’s own concerns about the\nhome lead District Manager/Deputy Director X to ask the Complainant and the POS\n(Purchase of Service) Monitor to make a safety check to verify Child C’s well-being\nand Foster Parent A’s home condition. District Manager/Deputy Director X informed\nAdministrator 0 the department was going out to the foster home.\nThe Complainant reported, she and the POS Monitor made a visit to Foster Parent\nA’s home at 5:00pm on 5/2/2022. During the home visit, upon entry into the home,\nthere was a strong urine odor and many flies flying throughout the home. The floor\nwas sticky. Bedrooms were cluttered. The kitchen had an abundant food, however,\nthere were dirty dishes piled up in the sink and the counter space. There were\nmultiple flies in the kitchen. There was open cat and dog food on the kitchen floor, as\nwell as the litter box. The door to the basement was broken and would not open all\nthe way. In the basement there were missing ceiling tiles, dog feces, and a urine\nodor. There were clothes piled up in the basement to where one could not walk\nfreely around. The Complainant reported the issue of a poor, unsuitable home\ncondition has been a recurring situation for Foster Parent A. The Complainant\nreported Spectrum licensed this home and should have had an idea of the foster\nhome’s conditions; and that the foster home is in violation R400.9301, R400.9307;\nand the agency of its contract with the department. Additionally, that the agency\nshould have been more active and involved related to Foster Parent A’s\ninappropriate home conditions, and the safety it posed to Child C. Especially, since\nthere was a 12/14/2021 social work contact entered by a prior agency’s worker, that\nspoke to the foster home’s kitchen floor being sticky, flies, and there being a urine\nodor in the home.\nThe Complainant reported a meeting was held with Spectrum via TEAMs on\n5/10/2022 related to this complaint matter. At that time Spectrum reported they had\na foster care worker (FCW) to contact Foster Parent A. The worker reportedly was to\nask Foster Parent A to clean up, but the worker did not go out to the home until",
    "5/11/2022. Spectrum also reported that they would conduct weekly unannounced\nhome visits to see if Foster Parent A’s home conditions have improved. Additionally,\nSpectrum planned to do a placement stability Team Decision Meeting (TDM) referral\nrelated to a placement change for Child C. The agency had a Family Team Meeting\n(FTM) with Foster Parent A, and but did not invite the department.\nOn 5/19/2022 I interviewed Administrator/Division Director 1, Program Supervisor 2\nand Director of Administrative Operations 3, onsite. All three-agency staff denied\nawareness of the condition of Foster Parent A ‘s home condition, or that Child B was\nremoved from the foster home due it being inappropriate.\nAdministrator/Division Director 1\nAdministrator/Division Director (ADD) 1 admitted Foster Parent A has had a number\nof complaints about her home and its upkeep, but Foster Parent A always corrected\nthe conditions. ADD 1 denied being aware of the multitude of inappropriate housing\nissues for Foster Parent A until this complaint. She reported Last Foster Care\nWorker 7 (who had Child C’s case from November 2021 until March 2022); Past\nFoster Worker (FCW) 6(who recently resigned/had Child C’s case from 3/11/22-\n5/16/22); the most recent supervisor, Supervisor 8 (who resigned 4/29/2022); nor\nPast Foster Care Supervisor (PFCS) 5(who carried Child C’s case prior to FCW 6)\nreported any such concerns to her. She denied seeing a 12/2021 social contact\nindicating documentation of a sticky floor, flies, and the home smelling of urine. She\nstated that information much have not been taken to their licensing department. She\nreported she did not know, because no one was reporting what was going on in\nFoster Parent A’s home. She did not know why the staff would not have been\nreported this information. She reported the agency has had a major problem with\nstaff turnover; and she attributed this as a part of the problem.\nADD 1 reported Foster Parent A has also had some struggles around taking on too\nmuch and the agency has worked with her. The agency offered Foster Parent A\nsupport, by way of offering respite, and connecting her with Children Center around\nworking with traumatized children. The agency also reduced Foster Parent A’s\nlicense capacity (Foster Parent A used to be licensed as a group home), to better\nenable her ability to care for Child C. ADD 1 denied Foster Parent A not being able\nto meet, the previous child, Child B’s need or DHHS asking for Child B’s removal\nfrom Foster Parent A’s home due to the home being inappropriate. ADD 1 said\nFoster Parent A requested Child B’s removal, because Foster Parent A reported\nFoster Parent A could no longer handle Child B’s behaviors. A TDM was held and\nthere was a whole plan around his removal in latter February or early March of 2022.\nChild B’s POS monitor was involved the process. As for Child C, ADD 1 did not\nexpress concern that his needs are not being met in the foster home. She reported\nChild C’s remains in the home, and they are not looking to replace him at this time.\nChild C has numerous special needs and there are no known placement prospects\nfor him yet.",
    "Program Supervisor 2\nProgram Supervisor 2 reported she is temporarily covering Child C’s case until a\nworker is hired. In terms of foster care workers not knowing about the conditions of\nthe foster home, Program Supervisor 2 reported Foster Parent A had COVID at one\ntime and the workers may have completed safety visits whereby they would not have\ntoured the foster home. She also denies anyone reporting these serious foster home\nconditions to her.\nAs for Child B’s removal from the foster home, she said DHHS was aware of Child\nB’s issues because DHHS teamed up with the agency around supervision when\nChild B was hospitalized.\nDirector of Administrative Operations 3\nAs previously stated, Director of Administrative Operations (DAO) 3 was interviewed\nby me in person on 5/19/2022. Email correspondences were also had with her as\ndocumented in the mythology section of this report. DAO 3 reported stepping in to\nassist the agency’s foster care/licensing department in late February or early March\nof this year. She has not yet completed licensing training as the agency hopes to fill\nthe licensing supervisor position quickly; and much of the supervisory tasks have\nbeen completed by Administrator 0 and ADD 1 who both have completed the\ntraining. However, because of the hiring crisis, DAO 3 was enrolling in supervisor’s\nfoster care and licensing training on 6/22/2022.\nDAO 3 reported Foster Parent A has been licensed with the agency for some time;\nand it is known that historically, Foster Parent A is not the best housekeeper. DAO 3\nsaid, what “DHHS discovered on 5/2/2022 was not known to us”. She reported that\nsince the last complaint the agency received on Foster Parent A’s home, something\nmust have occurred in/to the home. Such as Foster Parent A’s sewage backing up\nand a pipe busting in the basement. DAO 3 reported, Foster Parent A had not\nreported those things to the agency. DAO 3 was not sure why foster care workers\nwould not have noticed these issues. DAO 3 injected, that maybe a worker had,\ngiven there was a prior complaint. She reported the urine smell in the home may\nhave been due to both Child B and Child C having enuresis. She reported\ninformation like ADD 1 related to Foster Parent A’s pattern; which was that the\nagency would notice an environmental concerns in the home; they would mention\nthe matter to Foster Parent A; and Foster Parent A would fix the matter. Foster\nParent A had a hard time maintaining the standard for a long period of time. DAO 3\nreported as of 5/13/2022 all of Foster Parent A’s home issues have been rectified.\nThe pipe and sewage are fixed, the bedrooms are not cluttered, files are gone, and\nthe floors are clean. The basement where Foster Parent A’s adopted adult children\nlives is also clean.\nDAO 3 admitted the agency has had a few meetings to discuss, Foster Parent A’s\nsystemic history; to explore what support or assistance and resources could be\noffered Foster Parent A. At times Foster Parent A was accepting and wanted the\nassistance; and many times, Foster Parent A wanted to do things on her own. DAO",
    "3 reported, prior to DHHS’s 5/2/2022 visit, the agency was planning to discuss with\nFoster Parent A that perhaps it was time to retire her license. In the interim, the\nagency wanted to do more preparation around Child C’s replacement first. The\nagency did not want a situation similar to Child B’s to occur. Child B was replaced\nfrom Foster Parent A’s after the foster parent put in a 30-day notice. Child B went to\na relative but returned due to the relative inability of to care for him. Child B\ndeteriorated after coming back to Foster Parent A’s home; and then was\nhospitalized. The agency does not want that same faith for Child C; and is trying to\ndo more preparation and planning for his replacement from Foster Parent A’s home.\nPast Licensing Supervisor 4\nOn 6/14/2022 I interviewed Past Licensing Supervisor (PLS) 4 by telephone. PLS 4\nrecalled Foster Parent A and special issues related to the foster parent’s home and\nlicensure. She reported Foster Parent A was always getting a specialized rate for\nthe children Foster Parent A’s cared for, inclusive of, Child B, and Child C, but\nFoster Parent A did not always provide all that the children needed developmentally\nand or supervisory wise. She said the agency had knowledge of this and of Child\nC’s needs for extra supervision greater than what Foster Parent A was providing.\nShe reported an example of such by indicating staff had observed Child C beating\nup on Foster Parent A in the office. She reported the agency gave the appearance of\nproviding support to Foster Parent A, but they did not fully follow through. PLS 4\nreported speaking out about these concerns when she was on staff at the agency.\nThis included recommending a reduction in Foster Parent A’s license, when Foster\nParent A was licensed as a group home/had five special needs children placed in\nthe home. She reported she also advised foster care workers of what to look for\nduring foster home visits. Additionally, that she recommended revocation of Foster\nParent A’s license in 2021.\nPLS reported Foster Parent A has had a number of poor housekeeping complaints\nin the past. Additionally, that the home has smelled of urine and that the dogs/pets\nwere also peeing the floor. She said, Foster Parent A does well when workers give\nFoster Parent A the lists of noncompliance to fix. Foster Parent A follows up and\ntakes care of the noncompliance. Additionally, that as long as Foster Parent A\nknows “you are watching her, she will spruce things up” but it always ends back up\nin a deplorable situation. PLS believed Foster Parent A’s faulted home conditions\ncame about due to a lack of close supervision and monitoring. She indicated Foster\nParent A overextends herself, was overwhelmed with Child B and Child C. She said\nthe agency has always known of these housing issues. She denied knowledge of\nFoster Parent A’s home to have dog feces on the floor or flies.\nPrior Foster Care Supervisor 5\nOn 6/15/2022, I interviewed Prior Foster Care Supervisor (PFS)5 by telephone. PFS\n5 reported leaving the agency on 4/10/2022. She admitted being the prior supervisor\nand to carrying case responsibility for the foster children’s cases, at times. She\nrecalled Foster Parent A having housekeeping concerns when the agency’s\nlicensing department completed Foster Parent A’s annual home inspection in",
    "November or December of 2021. She said the licensing staff gave Foster Parent A a\nlist of concern to address. PFS 5 also reported historical maintenance issues for the\nfoster home. She said the home was never in perfect condition; licensing was\naddressing the concerns, and possibly issuing a corrective action plan. She reported\nmaking a home visit to Foster Parent A’s foster home in November and December of\n2021, and January and February of 2022. During each of those reported home visits,\nshe noticed that the home smelled of urine. She said she knew Child B was getting\nup in the middle of the night and peeing in the closet; and would also hide his\nsoaked clothes under his mattress. Child C also had bet wetting issues. She said\nthe house was also cluttered but not unsafe. She said, the pet litter box was out by\nthe bathroom, but there was no pet waste on the floor. She said Child B would also\nput food under his bed, and the floor might be sticky. PFS 5 said she instructed\nFoster Parent A to clean up. She said in November or December of 2021 Foster\nParent A sent her pictures showing Foster Parent A had completed a deep cleaning\nof the wooden floors, closet; and also sent pictures of the bedroom. PFS 5 did not\nreport whether some type of safety plan was done to address Child B and Child C’s\nongoing enuresis issues. She said her last visit to the foster home was on 3/16/2022\nand the home was not as described in the complaint.\nPFS 5 reported concerns the agency had with Foster Parent A were due to Foster\nParent A feeling stressed over caring for Child B, which PFS 5 also said lead to\nreplacement efforts for Child B. PFS also admitted the agency explored the matter\nof Foster Parent A not having foster children. This exploration was had by her, ADD\n1, PLS 4, and the prior licensing worker, in November 2021. The outcome of that\ndiscussion was that Foster Parent A was overwhelmed, and the agency would put in\nsupports, as well as, that Foster Parent A would explore getting community living\nrespite services for Child C. PFS 5 also admitted there was a period of time Foster\nParent A was in the hospital due to COVID and this was when extra services were\nexplored and provided to Foster Parent A. PFS 5, said, Foster Parent A’s adult\nAdopted Son D was with Child B and Child C. She was going out every weekend to\ncheck on the family. She was also taking food; and another supervisor transported\nChild B to school. Adopted Son D, walked Child D home from school and a bus\ntransported Child C to and from school. PFS 5 said the placement was still\nappropriate at that time.\nPrior Foster Care Worker 6\nOn 6/15/2022, I interviewed prior Foster Care Worker (FCW) 6 by telephone. FCW 6\nwas the foster care specialist for Child C’s case from 4/19/2022- 5/16/2022. She\nwas aware of the complaint this special investigation relates to. She made an\nunannounced foster home visit on 5/11/22 with Program Supervisor 2, after DHHS\ndisclosed information related to DHHS’s visit to Foster Parent A’s home on 5/2/2022.\nFCW 6 addressed the housing concerns with Foster Parent A and put in a safety\nplan. Foster Parent A said, Foster Parent A did not realize how bad the basement\nliving conditions were; that she was still recovering from COVID and had not venture\ndownstairs. Foster Parent A reported the flies in her home were due to a broken\npipe drain. Foster Parent A said the matter started out as a leaky pipe, built up, and",
    "then the flies came. Foster Parent A reported she had different repair people out;\nand fixed what was reported. Then one day there was a big gush of water, and\nFoster Parent A realized the pipe had rusted out. On 5/12/2022, Foster Parent A\nreported a person was coming out to repair the pipe.\nFCW 6 admitted to observing sanitary issue with Foster Parent A’s home prior to\nDHHS’s 5/2/2022 home visit. She made a foster home visit on 4/27/2022. At that\nApril 2022 visit, FCW 6 said the floor was sticky, there were flies in the house,\nclothes were piled up on the couch. Foster Parent A reported, Foster Parent A was\ndoing laundry and FCW 3 accepted that for the clothing clutter. As for the dishes,\nFCW 6 took it that Foster Parent A was behind on her housekeeping and was\noverwhelmed. She admitted to seeing cat food about, but she did not see a cat or\ndog. Nor did she ask the foster parent whether there were pets in home. Nor did\nshe go into the basement. She said she was a new worker and was not completely\nabreast on what constituted poor and unsafe housing standards. She said she had\na conversation with Supervisor 9, about the 4/27/2022 foster home visit and\nSupervisor 9 told her Foster Parent A was dealing with a lot. Supervisor 9 did not\naddress whether FCW 6 needed to do anything further. FCW 6 denied an\nawareness of a meeting with Foster Parent A prior to this complaint related to Foster\nParent A’s poor housekeeping. She recalled an agency meeting related to Foster\nParent A’s interaction with Child C due to Child C’s special needs/Child C being a lot\nto handle. FCW 6 said she was never advised that Foster Parent A required\nassistance with housekeeping, only help related the behavioral needs of Child C.\nReviewed:\nFoster Parent A MISACWIS provider record- I reviewed:\n Social work contact from 5/1/2021-6/30/2022 which showed nine\ncontacts, three (5/14/2021,5/26/2021 and 6/3/2021) were non-face- to-\nface related to special evaluations by the licensing supervisor or\nlicensing worker at the time. The remaining contacts were contacts by\nChild B’s adoption specialist, and one (10/26/2021) was a foster home\nvisit by that adoption worker. None of the contacts indicated a foster\nhome safety concern.\n Foster Parent A’s 11/8/2020- 11/7/2021 Foster home reevaluation\n(DCWL 4004) completed 10/22/2021. The reevaluation indicated there\nto be no changes in the appearance and cleanliness of the home since\nthe last evaluation; and that the home continued to be appropriate for\nfostering. The reevaluation documented social work contacts with\nFoster Parent A for 8/30/2021, 10/30/2021 and 10/14/2021.The latter\ncontact was for a home visit. These contacts are not listed in\nMISACWIS.\n Three pending special evaluations for intakes on 10/6/2021,11/7/2021,\n2/11/2022 and 4/15/2022. The 2/11/2022 intake included allegations\nthat Foster Parent A was hospitalized with COVID, leaving the foster\nchildren home alone. Additionally, that Child B and Child C have been",
    "urinating and defecating throughout the home. The home is in poor\ncondition and smell very badly.\n Child C’s MISACWIS case record (and viewed social work contacts for 5/1/2021-\n5/30/2022) which showed:\n There were four separate workers (one of whom was Past Foster Care\nSupervisors 5) during the time frame listed above.\n Spectrum foster home visit dates of 5/18/2021, 6/4/2021, 7/26/2021,\n10/8/2021, 10/27/2021,12/14/2021, 12/21/2021, 1/19/2022, 2/28/2022,\n3/16/2022, 4/27/2022, 5/2/2022(by DHHS) and 5/11/2022.\n Two of the Spectrum home visits (10/27/2021 & 5/11/2022) listed above,\nas well, the 5/2/2022 DHHS visit, were unannounced foster home visits.\nWith the except of the 5/2/2022 DHHS foster home visit, and the agency’s\n10/8/2021 12/14/2021, and 4/27/2022 foster home visits, a consistent\ndescription of interaction within the home, what was observed or whether\nthere were any safety concern in the home, that observation of the child’s\nbedroom occurred was not documented.\n The record did not show documentation of an August, September or\nNovember 2021 foster home visit with Foster Child C and the foster\nparent.\n The foster home visit documentations for 12/14/2021 and 4/27/2022\nindicated concerns within the home.\n The 12/14/2021 visit indicated the “worker entered the home and\nnoticed what appeared to be a urine smell in the home. The house\nalso had a lot of flies, and the floor was sticky. Foster Parent A was\nspraying the shelves with what appeared to be a bleach product.”\n The 4/27/2022 visit indicated the home had “a few flies in it and\nsome clutter, but other than that there were no safety concerns”\n These two-home visit documentations did not indicate whether or\nnot the concerns were discussed with Foster Parent A.\n A DHS-1105 for a FTM Activity report which indicated an FTM was held\non 5/9/2022, which showed FCW 6 and Supervisor 9 in attendance along\nwith Foster Parent A. During this FTM, Child A’s, development; family and\nkinship relationships, mental health and well-being, and Foster Parent A’s\nhousing concerns from DHHS’s home visit were discussed. The\nrecommendation section of this DHS-1105 indicated it was recommended\nthat Foster Parent A clean up her house, as per DHHS requirements.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,",
    "and review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\n(b)Assessing and certifying private family homes for\nlicensure and supervising the home\nANALYSIS: There is sufficient evidence to support that the agency knew\nabout the foster home’s very poor housing condition prior, as\nrecent as 4/27/2022 when the foster care worker observed\nhousing concerns like what the complaint indicated. The foster\ncare worker, the supervisor, nor a licensing staff addressed\nthose concerns at the time. Nor was there housing safety\nplanning with the foster parent in December 2021 when the\nhome was observed to be smelling of urine and having flies.\nAdditionally, the agency staff did not adequately assess the\nhome, or document consistent quality visits during foster home\nvisits. Nor did the agency complete foster home visits in August,\nSeptember or November 2021; and did not provide sufficient\nfoster home supervision or timely follow up on the 2/11/2022\ncomplaint related to the alleged poor foster home conditions.\nThe agency’s lack of, oversight, timely intervention and direct\nwork with relevant individuals, likely contributed to the home\ngetting to the point it had on 5/2/2022.\nRepeat Violation- 2022C0420002-October 2021,\n2021C0420042- September 2021.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency has not been consistently documenting its contacts related to the foster\nhome and visits.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/12/2022 I interviewed the Complainant by telephone. The Complainant\nreported, Spectrum has minimum social work contacts in MISACWIS related to Child\nC’s case. The Complainant reported Spectrum’s administrators’ had a limited\nresponse for those lack of contacts. The administrator reported it was due to worker\nturnover; and that the workers who the contacts are no longer with the agency.\nADD 1 was interviewed onsite on 5/19/2022. She reported worker turnover\ncontributed to inconsistent social work contact documentation.\nReviewed:\nMISACWIS case record for Foster Parent A and Child C as referenced earlier in this\nreport.",
    " Foster Parent A’s record showed:\n No documentation of a in person contact related to the 2/11/2022 and\n4/15/2022 special evaluation intake complaints.\n The foster parent’s reevaluation documented social work contacts with\nFoster Parent A for 8/30/2021, 10/30/2021 and 10/14/2021(this one is\nlisted as a home visit). These three contacts are not listed in MISACWIS.\n Child C’s record showed:\n Various social work contacts did not contain information required related\nto documenting a quality visits.\n Various contacts were not entered in MISACWIC within the five-business\ndaytime frame for face-to-face contacts. A 10/27/2021 home visit contact\nwas not entered until 3/28/2022.\n The record did not show documentation of an August 2021, September\n2021 or November 2021 foster home visit with Foster Child C and the\nfoster parent.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-5 Case Documentation.\nMDHHS and private child placing agencies must maintain all\ncase documentation in the child's electronic case record in\nMiSACWIS.\nANALYSIS: Social work contacts/efforts with the foster parent and or other\nrelevant parties related to the Foster Parent A’s three open\nspecial evaluations were not documented in MISACWIS.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-6H Case Contacts\nTimeframe:\nThe caseworker must enter the required face-to-face contacts\nlisted below in MISACWIS within five business days of the\ncontact. This includes attempted and missed face-to-face\ncontacts.\nQuality visit:\nA quality visit is defined as one in which the caseworker:\n• Views the child's bedroom and sleeping arrangements. •\n• Assesses each child’s educational, medical, dental, mental\nhealth and other needs and takes appropriate action or offers\nservices in response to the identified needs of each child.\nRequired discussion:",
    "The caseworker must discuss the following topics monthly with\nthe child's caregiver and document the information provided by\nthe caregiver in the appropriate work area in MiSACWIS. This\ndiscussion may occur at the monthly home visit:\n• Medical, dental, and mental health concerns, appointments,\ntreatment, follow-up care, and progress updates.\n• Child behaviors, concerns, developmental milestones.\n• Educational or school status, efforts, behaviors, and services\nprovided.\n• Caregiver's tasks to meet child’s needs, including any ongoing\nextraordinary care required of the caregiver; see FOM 903-03,\nPayments for Foster Family Care.\n• Child's adjustment to the caregiver's family.\n• Caregiver needs to support the child’s placement.\n• Permanency plan.\n• Safety plan, if applicable\nANALYSIS: Various contacts were not entered in MISACWIC within the five-\nbusiness day time frame for face-to-face contacts; inclusive of a\n10/27/2021 home visit not being entered until 3/28/2022.\nAdditionally, social work contacts, if any, related to actions taken\non Foster Parent A’s special evaluations after contact to DCWL,\nwere not entered. Also, many foster care social work contacts\ndid not contain information required related to documenting a\nquality visit. Such as viewing the child’s bedroom, other worker\nobservations, or what the worker discussed with the caregiver,\nand or the child, related to the child’s needs or placement\nadjustment, all so as to assess the child’s needs, safety and\nappropriateness of the placement to meet the child’s needs.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency has special evaluations it has not completed timely.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant\nOn 5/12/2022 I interviewed the Complainant by telephone related to this complaint.\nThe Complainant reported, Spectrum has a 10/7/2021, 11/2/2021; 2/11/2022; and\n4/15/2022 special evaluation intake listed in MISACWIS that have not been\ncompleted. The Complainant reported being unsure as to whether the lack of\ncompletion related to the agency’s staff turnover issues. Nor did the Complainant\nrecall whether the agency reported they would open a new special evaluation related\nto Foster Parent A’s inadequate home condition or add it to one of the exiting special",
    "evaluations related to Child C’s case. The Complainant reported a licensing worker\nwas not on the 5/10/2022 call the department had with the agency. The Complainant\nreported ADD 1 did not recall the status of each of the special evaluations.\nAdministrator/Division Director 1\nOn 5/19/2022 I interviewed Administrator/Division Director (ADD)1 onsite related to\nthis allegation. ADD 1 acknowledged that the agency has special evaluations it has\nnot yet completed. She said Licensing Worker 10 quit, on the spot on 3/25/2022, left\nwithout completing the investigations. The agency’s licensing supervisor also\nresigned one day in earlier March 2022 without notice, and the agency did not have\na staff to assign the investigations to. She reported the agency has made some\nadjustments and DAO 3 stepped in to fill the void. ADD 1 reported there are four or\nfive special evaluations listed in MISACWIS, but one is a duplicate. The oldest one is\nfrom October 2021. ADD 1 said she has put a timeframe on getting these special\nevaluations completed, but she did not report what is that time frame. She reported\nsince the complaints are listed under Licensing Worker 10 the complaints must be\ndeleted and restarted under whatever worker that will be assuming them. She said,\nLicensing 10 did not enter any social work contacts that Licensing Worker 10 may\nhave completed on the special evaluations. Licensing Worker 10 did leave notes, but\nreading them is “a mess”, difficult.\nDirector of Administrative Operations 3\nOn 5/19/2022 I interviewed Director of Administrative Operations (DAO) 3 onsite.\nDAO 3 also provided information to me by email as indicated in the methodology\nsection of this report. DAO 3 affirmed the information reported by ADD 1 related to\nher stepping in to assist the agency foster care/licensing department, the licensing\nstaff departures and pending special evaluations. DAO admitted that she has yet to\ncomplete certification and complaint training, but she plan to do so. She said they\nhave a licensing worker, Licensing Worker 11, a 10-year veteran with the agency;\nand so, the agency hopes to have information entered in MISACWIS related to the\nspecial investigations, within 15 days of the help desk giving access to Licensing\nWorker 11.\nReviewed\n Foster Parent A MISACWIS record, which showed:\n Four pending special evaluation for intakes on 10/6/2021,\n11/7/2021(which is a duplicate for 10/6/2021), 2/11/2022 and 4/15/2022.\n Neither of the three special evaluations have been completed; and there\nis no documentation in MISACWIS as to the status of these\ninvestigations, what contacts have been made, or with whom\n Special evaluation 2022C0630103 for intake 10/6/2021 related to\nallegations that Foster Parent A’s adult adopted sons are hitting Child B\nand Child C for either sneaking food into their room or talking back. The\nrecord showed the agency notified DCWL (Division of Child Welfare\nLicensing) on 10/13/2021. Also, that the special evaluation was initiated",
    "on 10/7/2021. The record did not show documentation as to when or\nhow Foster Parent A was notified of the complaint. A social work contact\nnor a letter denoting the notification was not listed or uploaded in the\nMISACWIS record.\n Special evaluation 2022C0630534 for intake 2/11/2022 related to\nallegations that Foster Parent A was hospitalized with COVID, leaving the\nfoster children home alone. Additionally, that Child B and Child C have\nbeen urinating and defecating throughout the home. The home is in poor\ncondition and smells very bad. The record showed DCWL was notified\nof the complaint on 2/18/2022. A special evaluation initiation date was not\ndocumented; nor how or when Foster Parent A was notified of this special\nevaluation. A social work contact, nor a letter denoting the notification\nwas not listed or uploaded in the MISACWIS record.\n Special evaluation 2022C0630767 for intake 4/15/2022 related to\nallegations that the previous foster child in Foster Parent A’s home had\nbeen locked in his room and would go days without eating. The record\nshowed DCWL was notified of the complaint on 4/20/2022. A special\nevaluation initiation date was not documented; nor how or when Foster\nParent A was notified of this special evaluation.

The total time for the\ncompletion of the investigation shall not exceed 90\ncalendar days without written approval from the chief\nadministrator of his or her designee.",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency admitted the special evaluations related to Foster\nParent A’s foster home have not been completed.\nFoster Parent A’s MISACWIS record does not show progress\nrelated to the special evaluation for 2022C0630103,\n2022C0630534, and 2022C0630767. All three special\nevaluations have surpassed the 45-calendar day mark; and\nthere is no documentation in the record that the foster parent\nwas informed in writing that an extension is needed.\nSpecial evaluations, 2022C0630103 and 2022C0630534 have\nsurpassed the 90-calendar day mark and written approval from\nthe administrator of his or her designee is not documented.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when, anyone in\nthe agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(b)Initiate a special evaluation of the foster home as soon\nas is indicated, based on the information received, but not\nlater than 7 calendar days after receipt of the information.\n(d) Notify all social services workers who have children\nplaced in the home that a special evaluation has been\ninitiated\nANALYSIS: Foster Parent A’s MISACWIS record did not show\ndocumentation of the date special evaluation 2022C0630534\nand 2022C0630767 were initiated/that the initiation occurred\ntimely, per the rule.
