    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A experienced an injury and infection to their foot and the\nfacility did not act on their need for medical attention promptly.\nInvestigation Youth A was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 04/10/2025\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. Youth A\nconfirmed that she had been released back to the facility from the\nhospital the day prior. Youth A detailed the course of events that\nled to her foot being infected. It began as a result of an injury that\noccurred when she jumped off of the balcony next to her bedroom\nand fell approximately 10 feet to the ground. This occurred in\nJanuary 2025. Youth A reported several medical procedures and\nsetbacks that had occurred since and noted she had been\nadditionally in and out of psychiatric settings since the initial\ninjury. Youth A described coming back to the facility in mid-March\nto resume her placement. She was using crutches, and her foot\nwas still healing. Youth A reported being provided prescribed pain\nmanagement medication and did not recall any concern with those\nbeing provided to her as directed. Youth A voluntarily stopped\ntaking this medication because she didn’t feel like it was helping\nher. She was prescribed a walking boot after the use of her\ncrutches ended, and she only used that boot for a few days before\ndiscontinuing its use. Youth A recalled an appointment with an\northopedic specialist where she was told her foot surgery had\nprogressed well, and the pins were taken out of her foot. Youth A\nbelieved that an infection in her foot began at that time and was\nlater told by the orthopedic specialist that the pin pulling procedure\nlikely caused the infection. Youth A noticed a growth on the top of\nher foot and then her skin bubbling up with fluid. She believed it\ntook about a week for her to be taken in to receive medical\nattention for the possible infection. She believed she had told staff\nabout it and she felt like they were ignoring her. Youth A could not\nprovide any specific names other than Nurse 1 and Chief\nAdministrator in which she spoke about this. Youth A believed\nshe received help for medical concerns when she asked, but also\n2",
    "received a response with a negative attitude from staff. This\nconsisted of facial expressions such as smirking and times when\nshe believed she saw staff whispering to each other about\nher. Youth A remarked that the foot infection has since\nsubsided. Youth A described the nursing services provided by the\nfacility, noting Nurse 1 and Chief Administrator normally act as\nnursing staff on a day-to-day basis. She stated a doctor visits the\nfacility once per month to address the medical needs of the\nyouth. Youth A was not sure if this doctor had given attention to\nher foot infection while it lasted.\nYouth B was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 04/10/2025\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She was\nasked about medical services provided at the facility. Youth B\ndescribed concern regarding an instance of a possible ear\ninfection. Youth B told Chief Administrator about the concern, as\nwell as the visiting doctor. Youth B reported over the counter\ntreatment was provided for her ear pain. Youth B recalled going\nto the hospital at a later date and received treatment for her ear at\nthat time as well. Youth B stated being aware of Youth A’s foot\ninfection and the other complications that resulted from the broken\nfoot in January. Youth B expressed concern over the promptness\nof medical treatment provided to Youth A but could not provide\nfurther details.\nNurse 1 was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on 04/10/2025\nduring an announced, face-to-face visit to the facility. She\ndescribed her role as an on-call nursing staff for the facility. She\noften speaks with direct care staff regarding possible medical\nneeds for youth and sometimes speaks to the youth\nthemselves. Nurse 1 recalled participating in the ongoing\ntreatment of Youth A’s foot since it was broken in January. Nurse\n1 recalled the specific timeframe when Youth A returned to the\nfacility from the hospital and then developed the infection in her\nsurgically repaired foot. At that time Youth A began to show\nCOVID related symptoms and was provided over-the-counter\ntreatment. Youth A was also picking at her surgical wound and\nnot keeping it regularly wrapped, and nursing staff were\nattempting to have her stop doing so. As Youth A developed\nmore of a low-grade fever, Nurse 1 recalled seeing Youth A’s foot\nshow some swelling and clear drainage. She believed Youth A\nhad an upcoming medical appointment with the orthopedic\nsurgeon. Nurse 1 helped clean the wound. Nurse 1 did not\nbelieve she had any other contact with Youth A after that date\nbecause Youth A went to the hospital and only recently returned\nto the placement. Nurse 1 did not believe there ever were times\n3",
    "she was contacted regarding a medical need for a youth and\nattention was not provided to that need in a timely manner. Nurse\n1 expressed concern youth at times would only be interested in\nleaving the facility for medical attention when whatever was\noccurring could be treated internally.\nChief Administrator was interviewed with DHHS Worker 1 on\n04/10/2025 during an announced, face-to-face visit to the\nfacility. She provided a timeline of the time period in March when\nconcern raised of an infection of Youth A’s foot. Youth A’s foot\nwas assessed on 03/06/2025 by the facility doctor. On\n03/07/2025 Chief Administrator recalled Youth A attending an\nappointment with the orthopedic surgeon that had previously\npulled the pins from Youth A’s foot. An MRI was ordered at that\nappointment. Chief Administrator confirmed Youth A had a home\nvisit with a prospective adoptive family from 03/07-03/09, and she\nsaw Youth A for her foot on 03/10. Chief Administrator recalled\nYouth A’s foot looking worse at that time, and Nurse 1 provided\nover-the-counter treatment for it. When Chief Administrator\nwitnessed Youth A’s foot not improving on 03/11, she called the\northopedic professionals that had been treating Youth A for their\ninput, as well as sending pictures. She was informed that lab\nwork was ordered, and that the orthopedic office would attempt to\nmove up the previously scheduled MRI for Youth A. Chief\nAdministrator recalled seeing Youth A’s foot the following day and\nbelieving it looked more inflamed and reported making multiple\ncalls to get more information on what course of action to\ntake. Youth A then proceeded to AWOL in the evening of\n03/12/2025. Chief Administrator stated this was notable because\nYouth A’s foot was showing signs of swelling, but Youth A also ran\non it a significant distance leaving and coming back to the\nfacility. Chief Administrator recalled ensuring Youth A soaked her\nfoot upon return from AWOL. She also remarked there was\nconsideration given to taking Youth A to the emergency room prior\nto the AWOL on 03/12/2025, but ultimately that was not the\ncourse of action taken because Youth A was moving on her foot\nwell, was not complaining of pain and other symptoms had not\ngotten worse in the days prior. Chief Administrator expressed\nconcern that taking Youth A to the emergency room prior to\nconsultation with the orthopedic doctor would only cause the\nemergency room services to be cut off until that consultation could\noccur. She then stated receiving a call from the orthopedic office\nthe following morning on 03/13/2025. The doctor instructed Chief\nAdministrator to take Youth A to the emergency room for medical\ntreatment. Upon admittance to the hospital Youth A showed signs\nof escalation and was eventually admitted for psychiatric\n4",
    "treatment while also receiving care for her foot. Chief\nAdministrator expressed never hearing youth state that their\nmedical concerns were not being addressed.
