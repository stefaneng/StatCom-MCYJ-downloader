    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one substantiated incident of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nSIR#2018C0219064 initiated on 08/14/2018 resulted in the substantiation of physical\ndiscipline when a staff began punching a resident after being repeatedly punched by\nthe resident, as well as restraint technique and staff failure to implement restraint\nwhen needed.

The corrective action plan successfully addressed the following citations as\nno repeats are noted: Annually updated central registry checks and annually updated\nTB tests for staff, documentation of legal right to provide care, chief administrator\nannual assessment, and prudent parenting trained staff on site. There are no repeat\ncitations noted.\nSIR#2019C0219007 initiated on 12/21/2018 substantiated the facility for failing to\nimmediately contact the assigned worker or birth parent when the resident required\ninpatient hospitalization. Corrective action included additional policy related training\nto staff. No repeat citations are noted.\nSIR#2019C0219008 initiated on 12/27/2018 substantiated the facility for staff abilities\nwhen staff grabbed hold of a resident by the shirt while escalated.

No\nrepeat citations are noted.\nSIR#2019C0219020 initiated on 02/20/2019 substantiated the facility for failing to\ntransfer a resident’s medications to his new placement after a stay in the hospital.\nCorrective action included additional staff training regarding medication transfers. No\nrepeat citations are noted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n7",
