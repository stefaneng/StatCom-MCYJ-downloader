TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The agency did not request or require technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• The agency did not request or require consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans during this\nlicensing period. This corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2023 renewal\ninspection, where the agency received 25 citations of which 12 were repeat\nviolations from the prior two years. This 2025 renewal inspection the agency\nreceived 18 rule violations, of which 4 are repeat violations from the last renewal\ninspection. The agency’s corrective action plan compliance around these 4 rule\nviolations is as follows: the number of individual cases cited for R400.12212(2)(e)\nand R400.12418(2)(a) have decreased. With respect to the other two repeat\nviolations R400.12418(2)(b) and R400.12418(5) the number of individual cases\ncited increased.\nAs it relates to the action steps in the 2023 corrective action plan, the agency has\nimplemented, completed or initiated the majority of action steps indicated in the\ncorrective action plan with respect to personnel, licensing, foster care, and\nadoption. As it relates to the agency’s financial stability violation, the agency has\ncompleted the action steps related to that citation, but it continues to have financial\nstability concerns. The agency reports it continues to work on this area.\nIt is noteworthy the agency’s financial issues brought forth another special\ninvestigation related to financial instability in November 2024. This special\ninvestigation, 2025SIC0000151 stemmed from a financial memo to DCWL with\nrespect to the agency 2023 independent financial audit and an ongoing concern\nnoted within that financial document. The 2025SIC0000151 special investigation\nreport found the agency continues to have financial liabilities, with large debts in\nsome specific areas. The evidence also showed that the agency is managing\nthese debts and paying its debtors timely. Only through additional time, and with\nincreased revenue may it be proven that agency’s financial progress will or will not\ncontinue.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s report dated 12/20/2024. This report\nindicated information as to how the agency’s second provisional license came to\nbe; and its connection to the agency’ 2022 special investigation that brought on\nthe first provisional license due to allegations of financial instability. The chief\nadministrator reported verbally and within this report that financially since its\nliabilities have exceeded its assets the agency will continue to operate as a going\nconcern until all its debts are satisfied. The chief administrator reported it is\nworking on these debts. She further reported all its bills are current and its\naverage bank balance is $90,000 with a current balance of $132,100. The chief\nadministrator indicated in this report that the agency is planning to absolve past\nliabilities through crowd funding. The chief administrator expressed concern that\nbeing on provisional licenses and being investigated related to the agency’s\nfinances when it has been able to continue to operate and pay its bills, has",
    "impacted staff morale as well as foster parent and adoptive parent retentions and\napprovals.\nThe agency indicated with respect to other areas cited during the past renewal\ninspection that the agency has not had any borrowed beds placement since the\nlast inspection and the agency continues to do the work on compliance in all areas\nby way of task checklists, in service training, monthly supervision agendas, and\nemail reminders to employees related to various tasks and due dates.\nFinancial Overview\nI received and reviewed a copy of the 2024 annual operating financial budget, and\nan end of the year 12/31/2023 independent financial audit report. The agency was\non a 1st and 2nd provisional license for financial concerns, but over the past several\nmonths they appear to be moving in a positive direction, they have set up payment\nplans and are paying down debts.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, as well as, the licensee\ndesignee, who serves as the licensing/adoption supervisor, I interviewed two\nfoster care workers, an adoption worker, licensing worker, and the foster care\nsupervisor. The employees interviewed reported feeling appreciated and\nsupported, that the administrators have maintained an open-door policy, that there\nis good agency communication, and the work environment is family oriented and\nwelcoming. Some areas these employees viewed as areas for growth included\nupgrading the agency’s technology, having more than one person trained/being\nresponsible for a major agency task/a significant agency function, more\nadvertising and involvement with other entities to establish a community presence\nand recruit families, and more funding so as to allow the agency to do more for\nchildren and families.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility did not indicate any concerns or safety issues. The\nagency has space and equipment for its staff; and files were properly stored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two identified safety alerts.\nSafety Alert 1: An unlicensed relative caregiver’s home did not have an operable\nsmoke detector on each level of occupancy and/or near all sleeping areas. Also,\nthere was no operable carbon monoxide detector in the home.\nResolution: The agency made contact with the relative caregiver on 12/20/2024 and\npurchased a smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector for the home. The\nfoster care worker went back to the family’s home on 1/6/2025 and verified that the\nsmoke/carbon monoxide detector was installed.",
    "Safety Alert 2: A foster home’s smoke detector on the second level of the home\nbetween the sleeping areas is beeping.\nResolution: The agency reported it contacted the family about changing the battery\nin the smoke detector on 1/14/2025; and it opened a special evaluation on the foster\nhome. The agency reported that the family indicated the smoke detectors are hard\nwired and all batteries needed to be replaced at the same time. The agency reported\nthe family had an electrician come out; and a licensing worker verified installation of\na functional smoke detector on 1/22/2025.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, the issuance of a regular\nlicense is recommended.\nMay 16, 2025\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 16, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
