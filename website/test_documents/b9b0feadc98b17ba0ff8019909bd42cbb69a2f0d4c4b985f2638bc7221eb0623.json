    "Review documentation in MiSACWIS regarding Foster Youth case\nrecord.\n06/30/2022 Comment\nPreliminary exit.\nALLEGATION:\nFoster Care Worker failed to file a 3200 when they were made aware of\nconcerns of neglect. Foster care agency has allowed Foster Youth to remain\nin placement with safety concerns due to lack of placement options. Foster\nCare Worker failed to follow protocol and has disregarded policy multiple\ntimes.\nINVESTIGATION:\n Foster Youth, age 16, was not interviewed for this investigation as her\nwhereabouts were unknown during this investigation. She was on AWOL status.\n Foster Youth is an MCI ward and at her last known address, she was living with\nan unlicensed relative.\n Foster Youth was placed with the agency on 3/17/2021.\n I reviewed Foster Youth updated service plan dated 11/14/21 – 2/11/22. The\nreport documented Foster Youth AWOL status as well as contacts with the\nsheriff office and the State police coordinating efforts to locate Foster Youth.\n It should be noted that the agency Foster Care Worker assigned to Foster Youth\ncase no longer works for the agency as she resigned from her position January\nof 2022. She was not interviewed for this investigation.\nI interviewed the Reporting Source regarding this allegation. She reported she had\nseveral concerns regarding the private agency case management. She said Foster\nYouth was absent without legal permission (AWOLP) from 10/2/2021 – 3/21/2021\nand again from 3/22/2022 – 3/25/2022, and 4/5/2022. She said when Foster Youth\nwas located, she was placed with unlicensed relatives. The Reporting Source\nalleged that the agency did not file a missing person report regarding the AWOL of\nFoster Youth. The Reporting Source reported that Foster Youth was located on\n3/28/2022 at the unlicensed relative home and admitted that she had a verbal\naltercation with her relative and that she left the home on her home and without the\napproval of her relative. The Reporting Source reported that Foster Youth reported\nto her during her AWOL, she was living with her cousin, grandparents, and\nbiological mother.\nThe Reporting Source said a special investigation was initiated on the unlicensed\nrelative home and during the duration of the investigation several concerns such as\nFoster Youth getting into verbal altercations and leaving without permission, safety\nplanning and appropriate placement of Foster Youth. The Reporting Source said\ndespite the concerns with the unlicensed relative, the agency placed Foster Youth\n3",
    "back into the home of the unlicensed relative. The Reporting Source said a Team\nDecision Meeting (TDM) was scheduled to discuss Foster Youth case. She said\nshe learned at the TDM that while Foster Youth was on AWOL status Foster Youth\nwas engaging in delinquent and risky behaviors causing additional concern for\nFoster Youth overall well-being as well as her future and improper supervision.\nI interviewed the agency Director regarding the allegations. She reported she was\ndiscussing the placement of Foster Youth with a DHHS Worker and informed the\nDHHS Worker that she wanted to schedule a TDM to discuss Foster Youth case\nand placement. The Director said due to Foster Youth consistently going AWOL,\nshe felt her agency could not keep Foster Youth safe, and she questioned whether\nFoster Youth was placed appropriately given her behaviors of constantly going\nAWOL. The Director said she requested a 30-day removal of Foster Youth from\nher agency at the TDM. The Director said there were a lot of disagreement between\nher and the DHHS Worker at the TDM and when she (The Director) expressed her\nconcerns about Foster Youth behaviors and finding another placement for Foster\nYouth. The DHHS Worker filed a 3200 while the meeting was occurring and\naccused her agency of knowing information about Foster Youth and her current\nplacement and not filing a 3200 report. The Director said she filed a 3200 report on\n05/06/2022 but that the DHHS Worker filed the 3200 report during the TDM\nregarding the agency concerns about Foster Youth.\nThe Director provided a timeline of Foster Youth’s behavior while place with their\nagency. A summary is as follows:\n 03/15/2022 Foster Youth found after being AWOL for 6 months.\n 03/17/2022 Foster Youth placed with Unlicensed relative.\n 03/22/2022 Foster Youth ran from Unlicensed relative home. Missing person\nreport filed DHHS, and law enforcement was contacted, and the following email\nwas sent to Guardian Ad Litem (GAL), Program Manager DHHS, POS Monitor,\nFoster Youth attorney, Agency Foster Care Worker, DHHS Foster Care\nSupervisor, and the agency Vice President.\n A home call was completed at the relative home on 03/23/2022. She said the\nrelative reported that Foster Youth left voluntarily, that she was concerned that\nFoster Youth was using Fentanyl and would not abide by her rules. She said the\nFoster Youth was threatening to hurt the relative and was having contact with her\nbiological mother. The relative reported that Foster Youth was at her aunt’s\nhome.\n The Director said clearances were ran on the relative and her boyfriend due to\ntheir Child Protective Services and criminal history, her agency was not\napproving placement.\n On 03/23/2022 Foster Youth was spoken to by her agency worker and Foster\nYouth shared that she and unlicensed relative argued, and the relative boyfriend\nthrew her things out of the house, and she was living with her cousin. The Foster\n4",
    "Youth told her worker that she was told she could not stay there. The Foster\nYouth said she talked with her grandfather and that he is willing for the Foster\nYouth to stay at his home.\n The grandparents are willing to keep Foster Youth temporarily. Efforts will be\nmade to file an Incorrigibility Petition tomorrow in Sanilac County DHHS office.

Foster Youth knows she must follow the household rules, is not to\nhave contact with her mother, needs to tell relative where she is and when she\nwill return, and will not use substances. Foster Youth would like to attend Port\nHuron High School and see what she can do for credit recovery.\n 04/26/2022 Phone call from relative boyfriend. He reported he and his girlfriend\ngot into a screaming match. Foster Youth called the police, no one was arrested,\nhe left the home and that the unlicensed relative may be evicted. A Safety plan\nwas put in place.\n 04/27/2022 Home visit made. Unlicensed relative stated she and her boyfriend\nwere arguing, safety plan was put in place for Foster Youth.\n 05/05/2022 at 10:00 am TDM held, requested by the private agency.\nPlacement stability TDM was held. Counseling Services, communication with\nagency, education, medical/dental appointments, and placement were all\ndiscussed with the participants.\n 05/06/2022 The agency contacted Centralized Intake regarding concerns from\nthe TDM.\nThe Director said DHHS, and her agency agreed with moving Foster Youth to\nanother placement due to safety concerns but Foster Youth attorney and the GAL\nwho was in the TDM did not support the removal of Foster Youth and they wanted\nher to remain at the home of the unlicensed relatives. The Director said her agency\nwas having a hard time placing Foster Youth and they could not find her a different\nplacement. She said all parties including the referee on the case was aware of the\nconcerns the agency had with Foster Youth and her placement. The Director said at\nthe conclusion of the TDM it was decided that Foster Youth would be removed from\nthe unlicensed relative home. Foster Youth could not live with her foster parents.\n5",
    "The agency would complete the residential paperwork and send the information to\nDHHS. She said the paperwork was completed and sent to DHHS. The Director\nsaid DHHS requested that Foster Youth case be returned to the Department, and\nthey will find her a suitable placement. She said Foster Youth was removed from\nthe unlicensed relative home on 5/25/2022 and placed in an Independent Living\nPlacement. On 6/30/2022, Foster Youth was on AWOL status.\nI reviewed the documentation the agency had on Foster Youth case. There were\ndocuments and case worker notes detailing the AWOLs of Foster Youth and each\ntime she went AWOL. A missing person report was filed with the local law\nenforcement and all parties pertinent to the case was notified.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12214 Compliance with 1975 PA 238.\nAn agency shall develop a written plan and implement the\nplan to assure compliance with 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.621,\nand known as the child protection law.\nANALYSIS: It was documented in case records missing person reports and\nthe efforts the agency made in attempting to locate Foster\nYouth. This information was also documented in MiSACWIS. In\nreview of documentation, protocols were followed regarding\nfiling a missing person report, notification to pertinent individuals\nassociated with the case. However, the agency failed to file a\n3200 report prior to requesting a TDM regarding Foster Youth\nbehaviors of having a verbal altercation with the unlicensed\nrelatives and the police being called. DHHS filed the 3200 the\nday of the TDM, 5/5/2022 and the agency filed a 3200 of the\nsame issues on 5/6/2022 regarding Foster Youth.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
