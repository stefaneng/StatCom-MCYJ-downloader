    "summary": "A special investigation was initiated at Vista Maria mental health facility following a specific allegation of sexual assault, made by Youth A, involving a male staff member entering her room at night and causing physical pain and pregnancy concerns. The investigation found no evidence to substantiate the specific assault allegation; Youth A recanted details in a forensic interview and video footage showed no male staff entering her room, leading to a finding of no violation for insufficient staff/supervision. However, the investigation did substantiate a separate violation: facility staff failed to report Youth A's concerning statements as suspected abuse or neglect as required by the Child Protection Law and internal policy, shifting the primary culpability from an individual assault to a systemic failure in mandatory reporting protocol.",
