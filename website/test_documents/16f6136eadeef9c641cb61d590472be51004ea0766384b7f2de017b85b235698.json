INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction, prevention;\nTitle prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159\nSection (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nDescription manner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Unknown staff restrained Youth A and caused multiple bruises\nand scratches on Youth A.\nInvestigation On 6/25/24, I spoke to DHHS Worker 1; scheduling and\nallegations were discussed.\nOn 6/27/24, I left a voicemail for Complainant 1. Phone call was\nnot returned.\nOn 6/27/24, I left a voicemail to Foster Care Worker 1. Phone call\nwas not returned.\nOn 6/25/24, the following interviews were conducted face to face\nat the facility:\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was restrained on 6/24/24. Staff 1\nreported he was not assigned to the same unit where Youth A\nresides but did come over to assist. Staff 1 reported Youth A was\nwalking around the campus and threw tables and outside grills.\nStaff 1 reported both, Supervisor 1 and Staff 2 were near Youth A.\nStaff 1 reported as he walked towards them it appeared as if\nYouth A was getting ready to punch Supervisor 1. Both Supervisor\n1 and Staff 2 initiated a restraint, and they placed Youth A on the\nground. Staff 1 reported he then went to help restrain Youth A by\nholding his legs. Youth A’s arms were held to the ground by both\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 2. While on the restraint, Youth A was\nagitated and took approximately 20 minutes to deescalate. Staff 1\nreported he did not have any concerns about how the restraint\nwas completed. Staff 1 reported he did not see any marks or\n2",
    "bruises on Youth A and denied anyone used inappropriate\nlanguage towards Youth A.\nSupervisor 1:\nSupervisor 1 reported he started his shift at 3:30pm on 6/24/24.\nYouth A demanded that staff supervising him for the day be\nchanged and he be permitted to go on an outing. When told, “no”,\nYouth A left the building and began walking around the campus,\nflipping picnic tables and throwing outside grills. Supervisor 1\nreported he began to follow Youth A, and Staff 2 joined him.\nYouth A stopped in front of one of the residential buildings\n(shelter) and continued to knock over grills and tables. Youth A\nverbally threatened staff, stating he is going to “beat their ass.”\nYouth A came towards them with his fist clenched and made\nverbal threats to them. Supervisor 1 reported he attempted to\nplace Youth A into a standing hold, lost his footing due to the\nuneven ground and they fell to the ground. Supervisor 1 reported\nboth he and Staff 2 held his arms down in the floor restraint\nposition. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A did struggle in the\nrestraint and yelled and threatened while on the restraint.\nSupervisor 1 reported he did not grab Youth A’s neck or choke\nhim, nor did he see anyone else do this. Supervisor 1 reported\nYouth A is an aggressive youth and does not do well when told\n“no.” Supervisor 1 reported once Youth A is escalated, he usually\nis unable to deescalate without some form of aggression.\nSupervisor 1 was able to verbalize the different methods to help\ndeescalate Youth A, yet Youth A was already in an outburst.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A did have a “nick” on his right eye\nand on neck but accounted this to the scuffle in the restraint. He\ndenied anyone using inappropriate language towards Youth A.\nStaff 2:\nStaff 2 reported there was a code called during his shift on\n6/24/24. He went to assist Supervisor 1 with Youth A. When he\narrived, Youth A had his fists balled up and flipped picnic tables\nand outside grills. Youth A was threatening staff and stating, “I will\nbeat your ass.” Staff 2 reported, as he approached Supervisor 1\nand Youth A, he noticed Youth A coming close to Supervisor 1\nwith his fists balled up but couldn’t be certain if Youth A jumped\ntowards Supervisor 1. Staff 2 reported Supervisor 1 attempted to\nplace him in a “high hold” and they both fell to the ground. Staff 2\nreported the ground was uneven which may have caused for the\nfall. Staff 2 reported he grabbed one side of Youth A’s arms while\nSupervisor 1 grabbed his other side. Staff 2 reported Supervisor 1\ntried to verbally deescalate Youth A, in which Youth A was not\n3",
    "listening. On the restraint, Youth A continued to struggle but was\nable to calm down. Staff 2 reported he never saw Supervisor 1\ngrab Youth A’s neck or choke him, nor did he see anyone else do\nthis, including himself. Staff 2 was unaware of any marks on Youth\nA. He denied anyone using inappropriate language towards Youth\nA.\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported he was restrained by staff and could not\nremember who they were. Youth A reported the individuals who\nrestrained him called him, “ho ass nigger” and stated, “I would\nhave shot you by now” and “fuck this nigger.” Youth A was\nsporadic in his conversation and was more concerned about a pair\nof shoes that he was missing from a previous placement. Youth A\nreported after he was restrained, he went to his therapist and the\nhospital. Youth A was able to verbalize that he was upset on\n6/24/24 and wanted to have a different staff supervising him\nthroughout the day and did report he flipped tables and grills.\nYouth A was unable to provide any other details to the restraint.\nYouth A reported he received a scratch on his eye. (I observed a\nslight nick on his right eyelid). Youth A reported he was not hurt.\nVideo Reviewed:\nI reviewed the video (no audio) for 6/24/24. The video started at\n3:33:27 and ended at 3:33:49. The video is consistent with\nSupervisor 1’s interview. A standing hold was attempted by\nSupervisor 1, and then a team control. Youth A and staff fell to the\nground, ending in a supine restraint. The video did not show\nanyone choking Youth A.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• The agency behavior management policy outlines the\nrestraint techniques outlined in CPI.\n• Supervisor 1, Staff 1 and Staff 2 personnel files pertaining\nto training and clearances. All were up to date. There were\nno discipline in the files.\n• Incident report dated 6/24/24. The incident report was\nconsistent with interviews and video. The incident report did\nnot note a hospital visit only the onsite nurse examined\nYouth A. The incident report does state, “has superficial\nscratches on neck and face, areas cleaned, antibiotic\noffered…”\n• Nurse Note dated 6/24/24 at 4:45pm: “has shallow\nscratches under right ear, right eye, left neck and mid\nforehead. No bleeding, no swelling, no discomfort, still\n4",
    "appears agitated and uncooperative.” No bruises were\nnoted.\n• Nurse note 6/24/24 at 8:15pm was sent to the hospital for\nsuicide assessment.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and video observation, the agency is\ncompliant. Youth A was aggressive physically and verbally and\nstaff engaged in an appropriate restraint for the safety of the youth\nand staff involved.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n8/15/2024\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
