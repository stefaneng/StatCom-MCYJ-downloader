I told\nComplainant that I would review staff supervision in relation to\nYouth A’s truancy form Wolverine Center. I also explained to\nComplainant that Wolverine Center is an open program.

Administrator 1 stated he\nand his staff follow Youth A on his truancies until line of sight is\nlost.

Each\ntime staff were aware of the truancy and followed Youth A until\nYouth A returned to the facility or line of sight was lost. Wolverine\nCenter is an open program, which requires exit doors open in one\ncontinuous motion and maintained in an unobstructed manner.\nYouth A’s truancy pattern is alarming and what happens during his\ntruancy time is unknown, but Wolverine Center provided the\nneeds, protection, and supervision of Youth A when he was at the\nfacility.\nCONSULTATION\nWolverine Center’s Department of Child Welfare Licensing\nConsultant met with Administrator 1 on 06/26/2023.
