    "ALLEGATION:\nA male has been sneaking into resident's room every night at the facility.\nINVESTIGATION:\nResident A was interviewed face to face at the facility on September 3, 2020.\nResident A said Resident B has been sneaking into her room for the past four or five\nweeks about once per week. Resident A said Resident B will climb into South Bluff\nthrough Resident C’s window and then cross the hallway and come into her room.\nResident A said Resident B will usually come around 11pm and then leave around\n5am. Resident A said she and Resident B will spend time talking and listening to\nmusic. Resident A said they are always fully clothed and denied anything sexual\nhappening. Resident A said when she hears staff near her door for a room check\nResident B will hide under the bed or in the closet and staff have never seen him.\nResident A said when he leaves, he jumps out her window. Resident A said\nResident C is aware of all the times that Resident B has snuck into South Bluff and\nhas helped him do so on several occasions. Resident A said the South Bluff\novernight staff always come and open her door and check on her throughout the\nnight, however she is unaware of the exact timeframes this occurs, stating “I don’t\nknow when, but a lot”.\nResident B was interviewed face to face at the facility on September 3, 2020.\nResident B said he has snuck out of Indian River and into South Bluff at least two\ndifferent times. Resident B said he goes out of his window and then into the window\nof the bedroom across from Resident A in South Bluff. Resident B said he leaves\npillows and blankets stuffed in his bed at Indian River so that staff think he is in his\nbed when they do a room check. Resident B said he has stayed all night at South\nBluff spending time with Resident A and Resident C. Resident B said he will jump\nout of Resident A’s window when he is leaving South Bluff. Resident B said he\nleaves a card wedged in the doorjamb of the door next to his bedroom at Indian\nRiver so that it does not locked and he sneaks back into the house through that door\nand back into his bedroom. Resident B said he was caught one time outside his\nwindow by staff but otherwise has never been seen or caught while inside South\nBluff. Resident B said he is able to hide in the closet or under the bed when he and\nResident A hear staff coming to do a room check. Resident B said while in Resident\nA’s room he normally sits by the closet because he and Resident A do not know\nwhen a staff might come into the room and that way he is hidden. Resident B said\nhe has never met Resident A or Resident C outside, and it has always been him\nsneaking into South Bluff.\nResident C was interviewed face to face at the facility on September 3, 2020.\nResident C said she has not participated in sneaking Resident B into South Bluff.\nResident C said she has not gone into Resident A’s room during the night to talk or\nspend time with Resident B and Resident A.

Resident C said the overnight staff at\nSouth Bluff randomly check on her throughout the night.\nSupervisor Z was interviewed face to face at the facility on September 3, 2020.\nSupervisor Z said all staff are trained the same for overnight shifts. Supervisor Z said\nstaff are told they must complete room checks within 15 minutes at variable\nintervals. Supervisor Z said that staff are to look into rooms but are not supposed to\ngo into the bedrooms due to a lack of cameras in the bedroom. Supervisor Z said\nthat all staff are to see a body part or see breathing in order to verify the resident is\nactually in the bed. Supervisor Z said he does not do additional video checks to\nensure the room checks are being completed appropriately.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on September 30, 2020. Staff 1 said she\nhas been working the overnight shifts for a couple of months and received full\ntraining on the overnight responsibilities. Staff 1 said she is to do room checks at\nvarying intervals not to exceed fifteen minutes. Staff 1 said she is required to see a\nbody part in the bed to ensure the youth is in the bed. Staff 1 said Resident A had\nvarious patterns overnight and at times would be awake all night, other times sleep\nall night, and then at times be awake on and off throughout the night. Staff 1 said it\nwas not unusual to do a room check on Resident A and find her awake in her room.\nStaff 1 said on nights when Resident A would be awake she would come in and out\nof her room, however Staff 1 said even if she saw Resident A in the hallway or gave\nher a drink of water she would still go down to Resident A bedroom and do a room\ncheck in her bedroom. Staff 1 said she never suspected Resident B was in the\nhouse and never saw him when she did her room checks.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on October 12, 2020. Staff 2 said she was\nhired and trained as an overnight staff. Staff 2 said she does room checks within\nfifteen minutes at varying times for each of the residents. Staff 2 said if a resident\ncomes out of their room she still goes and does a check of them in their room. Staff\n2 said she was trained not to go into the bedrooms of any of the residents because\nthere are no cameras in the bedrooms. Staff 2 said she goes to the bedrooms and\nlooks into the room and ensures a resident is in the room by viewing a body part.\nStaff 2 said there were nights with Resident A would not go to sleep and would sit in\nher room quietly. Staff 2 said it was not unusual for Resident A to have sleepless\nnights every once and a while. Staff 2 said she had no knowledge of Resident B\nsneaking into South Bluff until after it was brought up on September 3, 2020.\nDirector of Maintenance was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nSeptember 3, 2020.

    "ANALYSIS: According to interviews, video footage reviewed, and documents\nreviewed South Bluff staff were doing appropriate room checks\nof Resident A and Resident C. Resident A denied ever telling\nany staff and stated staff never knew Resident B was in her\nroom during their room checks. The Staff at South Bluff did their\nroom checks appropriately. Indian River is being cited in a\ncompanion investigation for not knowing that Resident B was\nnot in his room when they conducted their room checks.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe agency policy for Room Check, dated 7/24/2020, and specific to alarms states:\n1.
