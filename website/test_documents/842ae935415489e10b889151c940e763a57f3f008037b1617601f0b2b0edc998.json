DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nCCI Rule 400.4113 Employee Records\n(1) An institution shall maintain employee\nrecords for each employee and shall include\ndocumentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time\nspecified in this rule.\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan\ndepartment of human services, the equivalent\nstate or Canadian provincial agency, or\nequivalent agency in the country where the\nperson usually resides, that the person has\nnot been determined to be a perpetrator of\n2",
    "child abuse or child neglect. The\ndocumentation shall be completed not more\nthan 30 days prior to the start of employment\nand every 12 months thereafter.\nTwo of sixteen new employee files had a central registry clearance completed\nmore than 30 days prior to the employee’s hire date. One employee was hired\n4/12/23, but the central registry check was completed on 3/9/23. A second\nemployee was hired 4/18/23, but the central registry check was completed on\n3/17/23.\nCCI Rule 400.4114 Tuberculosis screening for employees and\nvolunteers.\n(1) The licensee shall document, prior to\nemployment, that each employee and\nvolunteer who has contact with residents 4 or\nmore hours per week for more than 2\nconsecutive weeks is free from communicable\ntuberculosis. Freedom from communicable\ntuberculosis shall be verified within the 1 year\nperiod before employment and shall be\nverified every 1 year after the last verification\nor prior to the expiration of the current\nverification.\nFour of sixteen new employee files did not contain verification of a negative\ntuberculosis test prior to hire. Two staff members completed tests, but never\nwent back to have the test results read so it is unknown if they were negative.\nA third staff does not have a TB test on file at all. A fourth staff cancelled his TB\ntesting appointment and there is not a test or result in the employee’s file.\nCCI Rule 400.4145 Periodic physical examinations\n(1) An institution shall provide and document\nperiodic physical examination for each\nresident as follows, unless greater frequency\nis medically indicated.\n(b) At least once every 14 months for residents\n1 year of age or older.\nOne of six active youth files reviewed did not have an annual physical in the\nfile.\nCCI Rule 400.4155 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter\ncare institutions; initial treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign,\nand date an initial treatment plan for each\nresident within 30 calendar days of admission.\n3",
    "One of six active youth files reviewed had an initial treatment plan completed\n34 days after admission. The ITP dated 4/13/23-5/12/23 was due completed on\n5/16/23 but was due by 5/12/23.\nRepeat Violation Established\n2021 Interim, CAP approved 10/6/21\nCCI Rule 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter\ncare institutions; updated treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign,\nand date and updated treatment plan for each\nresident at least once every 90-calendar days\nfollowing the initial treatment plan.\nTwo of six active youth files reviewed had an updated treatment plan\ncompleted late. One youth’s UTP dated 9/22/22-12/20/22 was completed on\n12/23/22 but was due by 12/20/23. A second youth’s UTP dated 11/30/22-\n2/27/23 was completed on 3/3/23 but was due by 2/27/23.\nRepeat Violation Established\n2021 Interim, CAP approved 10/6/21\nCCI Rule 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter\ncare institutions; updated treatment plan.\n(5) The social service supervisor shall approve,\nc ountersign, and date the updated treatment plan.\nOne of six active youth files reviewed had an updated treatment plan not\nsigned by the social services supervisor.\nCCI Rule 400.4166 Discharge Plan\n(1) When a resident is discharged from\ninstitutional care, all of the following\ninformation shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n(a) The date of and reason for discharge, and\nthe new location of the child.\n(b) A brief summary or other documentation of\nthe services provided while in residence,\nincluding medical and dental services.\n(c) An assessment of the resident’s needs that\nremain to be met.\n(d) Any services that will be provided by the\nfacility after discharge.\n(e) A statement that the discharge plan\nrecommendations, including medical and\ndental follow up that is needed, have been\n4",
    "reviewed with the resident and with the\nparent and the responsible case manager.\n(f) The name and the official title of the person\nto whom the resident was discharged.\nOne of two closed youth files reviewed did not have a discharge summary\noutlining subsections (a)-(f) in the file. The summary was later provided upon\nrequest.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Provided the facility with the TB Variance information again to ensure the\nrequirements of the variance are complied with.\n• Provided the facility with a reminder of Rule 400.4115 regarding CPR/First\nAid training to ensure the facility is scheduling staff on shift accordingly.\n• The clothing inventories for Ridgeview youth need to be kept in youth files\n(initials and discharge).\n• One open youth file did not contain a dental exam completed within 12\nmonths prior or 90 days after admission. The youth's dental exam was\ncompleted 6/3/22 & his admission date was 2/24/22. This dental was due\nprior to the timeframes of this audit, so it does not count as a violation.\nHowever, the agency needs to make sure medical and dental exam\ndocumentation for 12 months prior to admission follows the youth's file to\neach CCI within Bethany Christian Services.\n• The facility should not delay putting a discharge summary into the youth's\nfile while waiting for the new case management team to sign it. As long as\nthe current case manager and case management supervisor sign, that is\nsufficient.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• The quarterly file reviews aren't occuring for youth in TLC. The file review\nform is in each of the youth files, but no one is signing off or dating they've\ncompleted the quarterly review. Although this isn't a licensing requirement,\nit is part of the facility's process and should be followed to ensure an\naccurate and complete file for the youth.\n• Face sheets for files aren't being completed for TLC youth files. Although\nthis isn't a licensing requirement, it is part of the facility's process and\nshould be followed to ensure an accurate and complete file for the youth.\n• The Closing file review for discharged TLC youth wasn't done per the file\nreview signature page. The youth discharged in September 2022. Although\nthis isn't a licensing requirement, it is part of the facility's process and\nshould be followed to ensure an accurate and complete file for the youth.\n5",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had two special investigations during this period under review. One\ninvestigation (2023C0000016) resulted in a corrective action plan, but the other\ninvestigation (2023C0000557) is ongoing. The corrective action plan for SI\n2023C0000016 dated 1/25/23 addressed rule violations for 4109(1)(c) Program\nStatement and 4132(4) Grievance Procedures. The facility updated their cell phone\npolicy to reflect how staff are to use their personal cell phones at work. In addition,\nthe facility updated their grievances policy and procedure as well as created a\ngrievance tracking form. Since implementing the CAP, the facility has been\nsuccessful in training staff on the new cell phone policy, supervision of youth has\nimproved and the overall culture on the units has improved. The facility has been\nsuccessful in ongoing implementation and monitoring of their CAP and provides the\nappropriate documentation when requested.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's 2023 financial budget and Bethany Christian Services' 2022 financial\naudit were reviewed. There were no concerns noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nThe MDHHS Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) compliance monitoring report\nwas completed on 12/15/22 and the facility was found in compliance with all\nstandards.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted Bethany Christian Services Residential program\nhas been in licensing and contract compliance, but there are two systemic factors\nthat have an impact on keeping all youth safe and providing the best treatment for\nthem. The first is the lack of alternative placements for youth whose behavior\nwarrants placement in a different level-of-care setting and the second is continued\nstaffing issues. As with most residential facilities, the wages and hours have had a\nsignificant impact on staffing. CA reported they continued to partner with Human\nResources to design engaging job postings, advocate for a review of youth\nspecialist wages, partner with current staff to recruit staff from their network and\ncontinue to offer recruitment incentives for current staff to recruit friends in their\nnetwork to work for Bethany. CA noted there was one corrective action plan (CAP)\nimplemented over the last year in relation to a special investigation. CA reported\n6",
    "the updated policies as a result of the CAP have had a positive impact. Staff are\naware of the updated cell phone policy and are not being distracted from\nsupervising youth. In addition, grievances are now being tracked and none have\nbeen lost or unaddressed.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported there is good communication when there are changes,\npolicy updates, incidents, etc. Staff reported being short staffed has been difficult at\ntimes, but they know the facility is consistently trying to improve staffing by\ninterviewing and hiring. A couple staff reported they feel there could be more\nconsistency between Ridgeview-East and Ridgeview-West because staff\nsometimes work on different units. Staff feel they are supported, can bring up\nconcerns when needed and will be heard regarding those concerns. Staff feel\ncompensation can always be improved due to the rising costs of living, but they like\ntheir jobs and that's why they stay employed with Bethany.\nThree youth from Ridgeview and two youth from TLC were interviewed on 6/28/23.\nThe youth from Ridgeview did not have any concerns. They reported they felt safe\nat the facility, feel they have a voice, feel staff listen to them, feel staff care about\nthem, and they feel staff do everything possible to intervene during situations that\narise. The two youth from TLC stated they feel safe at the facility and have no\nconcerns with interactions with staff. Both youths stated they would like to have\nmore access to WiFi to make calls due to the differences in time zones between\nMichigan and where their families reside. They also stated they used to have\nweekly house meetings but feel the meetings have been less consistent lately.\nThey want to have consistent house meetings to ensure their voices are heard. The\nyouth also stated they want to have more outings and outdoor activities since it is\nsummer.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA tour of the facility occurred during the inspection on 6/28/23. The facility was\nclean and in good condition. There were no safety concerns noted during the\ninspection.\n7",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJuly 14, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 18, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
