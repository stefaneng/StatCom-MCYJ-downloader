Facility did not provide supervision of youth while at the\nhospital\nInvestigation Interviews:\nHospital Social Worker was interviewed via phone on May 30,\n2024. Hospital Social Worker reported Youth A was brought to the\nhospital via ambulance on May 29, 2024, due to behavioral\nconcerns. She reported Foster Care Worker was present and was\nasked to stay with Youth A while he was in the hospital. Hospital\nSocial Worker reported Foster Care Worker reported she could not\nstay and stated that Hospital Social Worker needed to call\nAdministrator 2 as Youth A was placed at their facility. She reported\nshe called Administrator 2 who reported the facility was issuing an\nemergency discharge notice of Youth A from their facility as their\nprogram is not equipped to handle Youth A’s behaviors. Hospital\nSocial Worker reported Youth A was placed at the facility less than\ntwenty-four hours before arriving at the hospital. She reported\nAdministrator 2 did not have a clear report from Foster Care Worker\nof Youth A’s behavior before accepting the youth into the program.\nHospital Social Worker reported Youth A has been cleared for\ndischarge from the hospital as of 3pm on May 29, 2024, and there is\nno one at the hospital providing supervision or willing to pick up\n2",
    "Youth A. She reported did not ask directly for Administrator 2 to send\nsomeone to supervise Youth A as she reported Youth A was\ndischarged from the program.\nFoster Care Director was interviewed via phone on May 30,\n2024. Foster Care Director reported he is aware of the situation with\nYouth A as Foster Care Worker called him on May 29, 2024, asking\nwhat to do since Hospital Social Worker was asking her to stay. He\nreported he gave the direction that it was the residential facility’s\nresponsibility to provide supervision as they cannot do an emergency\ndischarge of Youth A. Foster Care Director reported Foster Care\nWorker was at the facility on May 29, 2024, to visit Youth A as he just\nmoved there on May 28, 2024. He reported while Foster Care\nWorker was at the facility, Youth A escalated and the facility had an\nambulance transport Youth A to the hospital. Foster Care Worker\nwent to the hospital as a courtesy as the facility stated they were\nunderstaffed and could not go. Foster Care Director reported there\nwas a meeting scheduled with Administrator 2 and Therapist for 3pm\non May 29, 2024, to discuss the situation and Administrator 2\ncanceled the meeting five minutes before it was to begin stating she\nhad something come up. He reported he has not received anything in\nwriting from the facility requesting the discharge of Youth A and\nstated it took the facility three weeks to review Youth A’s referral\npacket before acceptance. Foster Care Director reported all\ndocumentation about Youth A’s behaviors was provided to the facility\nfor review and with that knowledge of his behaviors still accepted\nhim. He reported Youth A has unsafe behaviors and requires a two-\nperson transport with the foster care team. Foster Care Director\nreported when Youth A was being transported to the facility on May\n28, 2024, Youth A attempted to sexually assault one of the foster\ncare workers by trying to kiss her. He reported he is frustrated with\nthe facility as they have not sent any formal request for Youth A to be\nmoved from their facility and stated the contract does not allow the\nfacility to do emergent discharges.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed via phone on June 3, 2024.\nAdministrator 2 reported she was present at the facility when police\narrived on May 29, 2024, to help de-escalate Youth A. She reported\nwhen she arrived on the scene Foster Care Worker also arrived\nbecause she had scheduled a home visit with Youth A. She reported\nthey went inside the home to process more about the situation that\nhappened before Foster Care Worker arrived and Youth A began to\nescalate again. Administrator 2 reported Youth A was causing\ndamage to vehicles outside, and law enforcement had to restrain\nhim. Administrator 2 reported Foster Care Worker helped de-escalate\nYouth A by providing him candy bars, as the Foster Care Worker\nnoted Youth A’s grandmother would use this trick to help Youth A’s\nbehaviors stay calm. She reported Foster Care Worker was going to\n3",
    "leave the facility because she needed to get back as she was off of\nwork at 1pm. Administrator 2 reported she asked Foster Care Worker\nnot to leave yet as there needs to be a conversation about how to\nkeep Youth A safe as the facility is not equipped to manage his\nbehaviors. Foster Care Worker called Foster Care Director about the\nsituation and the plan was for Youth A to go to the hospital for a\npsychiatric assessment and Foster Care Worker would go up to the\nhospital. Due to Foster Care Worker’s relationship with Youth A,\nknowledge of his case history, and Youth A was only responding to\nredirection from her, she was asked to also go to the hospital to\nprovide more information. Administrator 2 reported she overheard\nFoster Care Worker on the phone with Foster Care Director stating\nshe did not want to get stuck at the hospital and did not feel\ncomfortable transporting Youth A. It was determined an ambulance\nwould transport Youth A. Administrator 2 reported about two hours\nlater she received a phone call from Hospital Social Worker stating\nYouth A was ready for discharge. She reported she told the Hospital\nSocial Worker that an emergency discharge request was being sent\nas they were unable to keep Youth A safe with his behaviors.\nAdministrator 2 reported she was never asked by Hospital Social\nWorker to come sit at the hospital with Youth A. She stated that she\ndid not mention an emergency discharge until she talked to the\nHospital Social Worker because the facility was open to potentially\ntaking him back to the facility if he received some psychiatric\ntreatment but since it was behavioral concerns, he met the criteria for\ntheir emergency discharge request. Administrator 2 reported she\nwould have sent staff to the hospital but because Youth A was at the\nfacility less than twenty-four hours and Youth A only responding to\nFoster Care Worker, she thought that it would be best Foster Care\nWorker attend. She reported she never expressed it was because\nthe facility was understaffed and stated the facility has taken youth to\nthe hospital in situations before and they make the staffing work.\nAdministrator 2 reported Therapist sent the emergent discharge letter\non May 30, 2024, to Foster Care Director and prior had multiple\nconversations with the foster care department of how the facility\ncannot keep Youth A safe at the facility due to his behaviors. She\nreported she understands the letter should have been sent earlier but\nshe wanted to make sure there was support provided to the team\nthat experienced Youth A’s aggressive behavior as this is not\nsomething the facility ever experiences. She reported the facility did\nnot receive all information about this youth as it was noted that he did\nnot have any behavioral issues for two months before being admitted\ninto the program, but she found out after placement that he had\nbehavior issues a week before placement that would have met the\ncriteria for him not to be accepted. Administrator 2 reported the\nfacility is not able to restrain a youth and they have lower functioning\nyouth at the facility that would be in danger of Youth A’s behaviors.\nShe reported she met with the Foster Care Director on Friday, May\n4",
    "31, 2024, to talk about this youth and she continued to get pushback\nthat they are not following the contract and they did not give him a\nchance.\nFoster Care Worker was via phone on June 7, 2024. Foster Care\nWorker reported on May 29, 2024, she was at the facility for a\nrequired home visit with Youth A.

Foster Care Worker\nreported she was asked by Administrator 2 to go to the hospital with\nYouth A due to staffing concerns. She reported when she had to\nleave the hospital, she told the Hospital Social Worker to call the\nfacility. Foster Care Worker did not call and talk to the facility when\nshe left.

She\nreported Youth A went into his room and when she checked on him,\nhe ran into his bed and started to masturbate. Staff 2 reported Youth\nA began to throw around things in his room and damage property\nwithin his room.

They reported police were called\nbut throughout all of these behaviors Staff 1, Staff 2, and Therapist\nattempted to verbally de-escalate Youth A.
