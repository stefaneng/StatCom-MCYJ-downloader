CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first Corrective Action Plan (CAP) was approved on 6/30/16 and addressed the\nfollowing violations:\n R 400.12205 Required staff for staff being over in case load sizes.\n R 400.12207 Staff responsibilities due to an agency assessment not being\nsubmitted.\n R 400.12209 Orientation and training was cited because 2 new employees did\nnot have documentation that they received orientation.\n R 400.12312 Foster parent training was cited due to a foster parent not having\nthe required hours of training.\n R 400.12324 Reevaluation due to a reevaluation being completed late and not\nhaving all the necessary information.\n R 400.12326 Borrowed home because the agency had no0t endorsed the reports\nsubmitted by the certifying agency.\n R 400.12505 Supervision was cited because Independent Living files did not\nhave all required visits documented.\n MSA VII A 5 Assessments and Service Plans because of a lack of signatures.\n MSA VIII B 3 Medical Files due to incorrect information on the medical passport.\n MSA VIII D 2 Foster and Adoptive Home Recruitment, Retention, and\nSupport was cited because the agency did not submit a plan.\n DHHS Policy FOM 722-8 Supervisor Signature on ISP due to a supervisor\nsigning the report late.\n11",
    " DHHS Policy FOM 722-8C Required Participation of Foster Parents in the\nDevelopment of Service Plans due to missing foster parent signatures.\n DHHS Policy FOM 722-6H Home Visit due to missing visits.\n DHHS Policy FOM 722-6H CASEWORKER CONTACT WITH CHILD IN OUT-\nOF-HOME PLACEMENT due to a missing second visit in the second month of\nplacement.\n DHHS Policy FOM 722-6H Unannounced Home Visit due to missing\nunannounced visits.\n DHHS Policy ADM 300 Required Information in an Adoption Assessment\nbecause CAA’s were completed late.\n DHS Policy ADM 980 Closing due to a missing closing summary.\n DHS Policy ADM 980 Closing Letter because of a missing closing letter.\nThe number of violations and repeat violations has decreased significantly this year.\nThis indicates the agency’s corrective action plans are working. Some adjusting of\nindividual corrective actions may be necessary to gain full compliance.\nSpecial Investigation 2016C0103029 was initiated when it was alleged that a Foster\nChild was staying with an unlicensed caregiver when she was supposed to be in a\nlicensed foster home. It was found that the unlicensed provider was only a substitute\ncare provider and the child was not living there. The agency was not found in violation\nin regards to the allegation however an additional finding of R 400.12420 Updated\nservice plans was cited due to a lack of contacts in the case file. The agency\nappropriately addressed the violation in a corrective action plan that was approved on\n11/17/16.\nSpecial Investigation 2017C0103012 was initiated when it was reported that the\nagency did not address a notice to have a youth moved timely. It was found that the\nworker on the case did not have the ability to complete her duties. The agency was\nfound in violation of R 400.12206 Staff qualifications with an additional finding of R\n400.12204 Facilities due to the agency having on-going issues with internet, e-mail,\nand fax systems. The agency appropriately addressed the violations and their\ncorrective action plan was approved on 3/17/17.\nVII. SUMMARY OF ANALYST VISIT\nConcerns about the agency were brought up by Foster Parent 2. Foster Parent 2’s\nconcerns had been brought up previously and addressed with the agency and the\nFoster Parent.\nSafety concerns brought up by the field analyst were addressed by the agency. A\nmissing heating vent cover and ceiling tile were replaced. The smoke detectors that\nwere indicated as missing were not actually missing but were hanging in a different\nlocation. The previous detector holders remained on the wall making it look like there\nwere missing detectors.\n12",
    "Relative Placement 1 had concerns that were addressed with the agency, however\ndocumentation in the file indicated the family was supplied with information about\nrelative home support. The children have since been removed from the home and\nservices are being sought for them.\nThe agency is being cited for misrepresenting that Relative 1 had enough beds for\neveryone in the home. The agency indicated they were ordering a bed and because of\nthis they thought it was okay to indicate the home had enough beds.\nOther concerns brought up about lack of support to foster/relative parents were\naddressed with the agency during the exit conference.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes, rules, ISEP and contract requirements. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n6/19/17\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 27, 2017\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n13"
