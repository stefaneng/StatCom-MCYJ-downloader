EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. Although this inspection found a foster parent spanked a youth and was\nfound in compliance which is not consistent with findings of fact and will be\naddressed in the agency’s corrective action plan. The foster home license is\nclosed.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nDuring this licensing inspection period the agency submitted one acceptable\ncorrective action plans. That corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024\nRenewal inspection where it was found in violation of 25 rule violations. During this\n2025 Interim 11 violations were repeat violations from the 2024 Renewal\ninspection; and 6 are repeat violations from the 2023 Interim inspection. The\nagency’s corrective action plan compliance around the 11 rule violations is as\nfollows: the number of individual cases cited decreased by 1 related to three rule\nviolations; decreased by 2 related to one rule violation; increased by 1 related to\n10",
    "five rule violations; and increased by 2 related to two rule violations. With regards\nto the 6-repeat violation from the 2023 Interim inspection; the number of individual\ncases cited increased by 1 related to two rule violations, remained the same\nrelated to two rule violation; and decreased by 2 related to two rule violations. The\nagency contributed various repeat violations to their staff still learning how to\nbetter organize their work; and the corrective action was not approved until August\n2024, which in turn delayed in its implementation.\nA review of the agency’s 2024 Renewal corrective action plan showed the agency\nhas implemented all aspects of the corrective plan. That implementation did not\nresult in complete compliance of all licensing rules during this inspection. The\nagency reported further corrective action planning is now occurring via quarterly\nmeetings on rule issues, as they strive for compliance to all rules.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s (CA) report dated 5/1/2025. The CA\nreport indicated the bulk of its past non-compliance were due to report timeliness\nand accuracy of forms. The CA further indicated that staff are still learning how to\norganize their work to get their work completed timely. The CA reported as a\nresult of the corrective action plan (CAP), training was provided to staff to help\nthem better understand policies and procedures. Also, they learned after the fact\nthat some of their corrective action plan’s action steps and verifications were not\nwritten in a way that were verifiable. Additionally, the CA reported the agency was\nworking to implement better tracking of reports; and supervisors were\nimplementing quarterly CAP reviews to ensure for oversight and compliance\ntracking.\nThe CA identified the agency’s strengths as their improvement in staff retention;\nimplementation of case contact meeting which has helped with improvement of\nvarious key performance indicators; and their use of a case aide related to\nreminders and transportation with respect to medical and dental examinations.\nAreas of focus identified by the CA were more timely signatures on treatment\nplans for service plans with the aid of electronic software, and timeliness of action\nsummaries.\nThe agency is advised to continue all it efforts to ensure for greater rule\ncompliance.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a 2025 annual foster care and adoption budget; as well as\na copy of its 12/31/2023 independent financial audit. A review of these documents\ndid not show indications of any notable areas of concern.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, program manager,\nlicensing/adoption supervisor, and foster care supervisor, I interviewed the\nsupervisor of independent living youth advocates, a foster care worker, a licensing\n11",
    "worker, adoption worker, and independent living youth advocate. The staff\ninterviewed reported good, strong, agency communication; teamwork; caring,\nsupportive managerial staff who hear the staff; flexibility around staff schedules,\nand the agency always striving to improve amongst the agency’s strengths. Areas\nof growth reported, related the agency seeking to gain more information on new\ncases at the time the referral is accepted, dress code issues, and greater\norganization of paperwork within the independent living house.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA tour of the agency’s office did not reveal any concerns or safety issues. The\nagency appears to have sufficient equipment for its staff, and agency records are\nsecurely stored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one identified safety alert:\nSafety Alert: The safety of the child and home could not be assessed.\nResolution: A special evaluation was opened on the foster home on 3/20/2025. The\nagency visited the foster home on 3/20/2025 and no concerns were noted. The youth\nin the home was interviewed and was reported as happy and safe. The special\nevaluation on the home was targeted to be completed by 5/4/2025.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJune 12, 2025\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 13, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n12"
