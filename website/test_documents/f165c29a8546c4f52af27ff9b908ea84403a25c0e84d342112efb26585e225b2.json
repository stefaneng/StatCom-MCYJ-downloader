Staff 1 said she was working with two other\n“new” staff and one staff that was in training the night that Youth A,\nYouth C, and Youth D were in the altercation. Staff 1 said all the\nyouth agreed on a movie to watch however then began to\ndisagree about it once staff started it. Staff 1 said Youth C began\nto make “nasty statements” about Youth A’s hygiene. Staff 1 said\nYouth A began to argue back with Youth C and all of a sudden\nYouth D “charged” Youth A. Staff 1 said she and the other staff\npositioned themselves between the youth and attempted to stop\nYouth D from assaulting Youth A.

Staff 1 said one of the new staff rode to the hospital\nwith Youth A however then Staff 2 met him and took over the\nsupervision at the hospital. Staff 1 said Medical Technician\npurchased a dress, fanny pack, and “a lot of other items” for Youth\nA out of her personal money. Staff 1 said the reason she believes\nthe dress was bought from Medical Technician’s money is\nbecause Youth A was trying to hide it under her shift from Staff 3\nwhen she returned to the house. Staff 1 then clarified that she was\nnot working that day and had only heard about the incident. Staff 1\nthen said she was present when Youth A returned from a medical\nappointment with a new fanny pack. Staff 1 said she was told that\nYouth A was bought the fanny pack to bring her inhaler back and\nforth to cheerleading. Staff 1 said she was told by Director that\nwas not a purchase off the facility card and there was no receipt\nhanded in for it. Staff 1 said Youth A had been with Medical\nTechnician when the fanny pack was purchased and therefore it\nhad to have been bought with personal money. Staff 1 said when\nshe began working at New Hope Youth Center she was training to\n5",
    "be the medical technician however was not able to be trained\nwhile on shift so would call Medical Technician in the evening for\ntraining. Staff 1 said Medical Technician sounded intoxicated\nduring the phone calls and would be asked two questions and she\nwould ramble on for two hours and never answer the questions.\nStaff 1 said after the training calls Medical Technician would say\nthings were never discussed during the calls that clearly had been\ntalked about. Staff 1 said she has never seen Medical Technician\nintoxicated at work. Staff 1 said Medical Technician is the support\nperson for many youth that will call her at night, but she is not\naware of any times when Medical Technician would answer while\nintoxicated.\nStaff 2 was called on August 13, 2024, and August 20, 2024.\nStaff 2 did not answer her phone or return the voicemails left for\nher. Staff 2 is no longer employed at New Hope Youth Center,\ntherefore was not interviewed.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via telephone on August 21, 2024.\nStaff 3 said she has no knowledge of Medical Technician buying\nYouth A or any other youth clothing or any other items out of her\npersonal money. Staff 3 said Medical Technician was previously\nthe program director and, in that role, would handle the youths\n“needs requests” where they will fill out a request asking for\nanything they need or want and Medical Technician would\ndetermine if it was approved and if so, would go to the store and\nbuy the item with the agency credit card. Staff 3 said Medical\nTechnician would frequently buy youth items and bring them back\nto the agency for the youth. Staff 3 said there was a shift she was\nrunning where Youth A had been having poor behaviors that day\nand the days prior, destroying the house, not following the rules,\nand being disrespectful towards staff, and began to demand to be\nbrought to Rue 21 for a new shirt. Staff 3 said she told all staff,\nMedical Technician included, that Youth A was not allowed to go\nshopping due to her behaviors. Staff 3 said Youth A went on a\ntransport with Medical Technician and when she came back, she\nhad on a dress Staff 3 had never seen. Staff 3 said she called the\nAssistant Facility Administrator and asked her to watch camera to\nsee if Youth A had the dress with her when she left for the outing.\nStaff 3 said it was unable to be determined if she had the dress,\nbut it appeared she did have something under her shirt when she\nleft for the outing. Staff 3 clarified the concern in that situation was\nnot that Medical Technician had bought her the dress out of her\nmoney, it was if Youth A was indeed brought shopping after Staff 3\nsaid she was not allowed to go. Staff 3 said she has worked many\nshifts with Medical Technician and has never been concerned that\n6",
    "she was intoxicated. Staff 3 said she has had to call Medical\nTechnician after hours for different reasons, and she has never\nbelieved Medical Technician was intoxicated during those calls.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Medical Technician’s personnel file: There was no\ndisciplinary record and Medical Technician completed\ntraining on Youth-Staff Boundary policy in June 2024.\n• New Hope Youth Center’s Youth-Staff Boundary policy was\nreviewed. The policy states “Under no circumstance is an\nemployee, regardless of position, to do any of the following:\nDemonstrate or exhibit special treatment to youth or give\ngifts to you as special consideration. The facility may issue\npolicies for gift giving that are consistent for all youth and\ndirectly from the facility budget and not any single staff\nperson.”\n• New Hope Youth Center’s Standards of Conduct policy was\nreviewed. The policy states “While not intended to list all\nthe forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in\nthe workplace, the following are examples of rule\ninfractions or misconduct that may result in disciplinary\naction, including termination of employment. Working under\nthe influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.”\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as per staff and youth\ninterviews there is no evidence to believe Medical Technician is\nbuying Youth A items out of her personal money, or that Medical\nTechnician has been intoxicated while working.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
