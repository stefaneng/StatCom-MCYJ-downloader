    "emotionally stable and of suitable health, ability, experience,\nand education to perform the duties assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff allegedly made sexual advances towards youth and either\ntouched the youth or attempted to touch the youth. Staff told youth\nshe could move in with him.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on 7/16/25. No\nadditional information was provided.\nThe following interviews were conducted face to face in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker at the facility on 7/16/25:\nAdministrator reported they received a grievance from Youth A\nconcerning Staff 1. The allegations did not involve sexual touching\nonly that Staff 1 was verbally inappropriate towards Youth A.\nAdministrator reported Clinical Director reviewed the grievance\nand completed her process. Administrator reported Youth A has a\nhistory of being sexually promiscuous and making allegations the\nstaff are all pedophiles. Administrator reported Staff 1 does not\nusually work with Youth A as he is a floater and would only cover\na pod if they needed assistance. They reviewed video footage of\nthe interactions Youth A might have had with Staff 1 and Staff 1\nwas never near her or displayed any sexual advances.\nClinical Director reported she received a grievance June 30,\n2025, from Youth A. The grievance noted that Staff 1 had stated\n“inappropriate things” to her and that he had asked her to move in\nwith him. The inappropriate comment Youth A stated was after her\nshower. She stated Staff 1 asked her, “Did you clean up the\nshower knowing what you did in there?” Clinical Director said\nthere was never allegation of Youth A being touched by Staff 1.\nClinical Director reported Youth A was on wing restriction during\nthis time. This meant Youth A would have been in her room and\none staff sitting outside of her room. Clinical Director reported\nStaff 1 is a floater so he might come in and check on her. Clinical\nDirector reported that when Youth A gets upset, she tends to\nmake up stories to get others into trouble. Clinical Director\nreported Youth A tends to write grievances just so she can talk to\nsomeone. Clinical Director reported Youth A has called male staff\npedophiles when she gets upset. Clinical Director reported she\nreviewed camera footage on or around 6/30/25 and there was\nnothing on the camera to validate Youth A’s allegations. Clinical\nDirector reported she talked to Staff 1, and he denied the\n2",
    "allegations. Clinical Director reported they received another\ngrievance from Youth B on 7/3/25 stating the same things as\nYouth A. Clinical Director reported she never got to interview\nYouth B because they terminated Staff 1 on 7/5/25 due to an\nincident report they received stating Staff 1 gave out personal\ninformation concerning Staff 2.\nSupervisor reported he supervises Staff 1. Supervisor reported\nStaff 1 had some boundary issues with youth. These were\ndescribed as Staff 1 acting more of a friend at times than staff and\nfailing to provide structure. Supervisor preferred Staff 1 being a\nfloater instead of full time staff in a unit. Supervisor reported\nbecause of Staff 1’s lack of structure with the group he had not\nreceived a permanent spot in a group yet.\nAdministrator, Clinical Director, and Supervisor all reported\nwhen they received the allegations, they didn’t allow Staff 1 to be\non the pod with Youth A. All three reported that on 7/5/25 they\nreceived an incident report that a male youth knew too much\npersonal information about Staff 1 and Staff 2, alleging Staff 1 told\npersonal information to the youth. Due to this, the previous\nconcerns of lack of structure, and the grievance, they terminated\nStaff 1.\nOn 7/23/25 the following interviews were conducted face to face in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker at the facility.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 is a float staff. Youth A reported Staff 1\nhas never been their group staff and she has never been alone\nwith Staff 1. Youth A reported she was in the gym playing\nbasketball with Youth B and Staff 1 came over and wiped his\nforehead and said, “that looks like lube.” Youth A reported he\nnever explained what he meant, but she thought he was referring\nto lubrication you use for sexual gratification. Youth A reported\nanother time she was showering, and Staff 1 said to her, “Make\nsure you clean up - don’t want anyone else to slip and fall.” Youth\nA reported she thinks Staff 1 was implying Youth A was\nmasturbating, and someone would slip due to this, but Staff 1\nnever explained what he meant. Youth A reported Staff 1 gave his\nInstagram account information to her. The account was\n“DCmarvel.” Youth A gave us her Instagram and stated she was\nfriends with him. Her account was “duh_unwanted.” Youth A\nreported she also gave Staff 1 her girlfriend’s Instagram which\nwas “mera_essence”. Youth A reported Staff 1 stated he would\n“give her a joint” when she gets out and she could come live with\nhim when she leaves. Youth A reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 had a\n3",
    "relationship and one day Youth A told Staff 2 about the\nconversation she had with Staff 1, and it made Staff 2 cry. When\nStaff 2 started crying she questioned Staff 2, “Why are you\nupset?” Youth A reported Staff 2 left the unit and another staff\nfilled in. Youth A reported she didn’t mind the conversations with\nStaff 1 but then felt like it was getting weird, so she filed a\ngrievance. Youth A reported Staff 1 never touched her or\nattempted to touch her. Youth A reported she has called staff\n“perverts and pedophiles” when she is upset with them. Youth A\nreported she did not know Staff 1’s address or phone number.\nYouth B reported Staff 1 had an inappropriate conversation with\nher a “week or two ago.” Youth B reported Staff 1 is usually a\nfloater. Youth B reported she went up to him and said, “What’s the\nword? I heard you said Youth A can move in with you?” Youth B\nreported he told her she could move in too. Youth B couldn’t\nprovide any details about who else was around or where this took\nplace. Youth B reported they had another conversation where\nYouth A and Staff 1 were together and Staff 1 asked, “What are\nyour types?”, which Youth B said meant “what type of guys you\nlike?”. She reported Staff 1 had asked them how many guys they\nslept with. Youth B reported he had told them about his girlfriend\nand discussed his sexual experience with her. Youth B reported\nshe had played cards with him one day and he asked for her\nInstagram information and she gave it to him. Her Instagram\naccount was “EBK._slime_da_city.” Youth B reported Staff 1 only\ntalked about these things in private with them. Youth B reported\nhe never touched or attempted to touch her. Youth B reported she\ndoes not know Staff 1’s phone number or address. Youth B\nreported she didn’t file a grievance until after Youth A filed hers\nbecause she wanted to support her.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Worker on 8/5/25. Staff 2 reported she wrote an\nincident report on 7/3/25 noting Youth A and Youth B spoke to her\nand stated Staff 1 had made inappropriate comments towards\nthem, making them uncomfortable. They alleged he exchanged\nsocial media information, told them they could live with him, and\ndiscussed sexual comments about “lube.” Staff 2 did not hear\nthese comments from Staff 1. Staff 2 admitted she was upset with\nthe things the youth were saying because they kept “poking” at\nher by stating Staff 1 also told the boy units Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere in a relationship and Staff 2 doesn’t wear any underwear.\nStaff 2 reported she was friends with Staff 1, and she hung out\nwith him after work. Staff 2 was adamant she did not have a\nromantic relationship with him. Staff 2 reported she had to leave\n4",
    "the unit due to the things Youth A and Youth B were saying\nbecause it upset her. Staff 2 reported she had never heard Staff 1\nspeak inappropriately with any youth but said Staff 1 was more of\na friend than staff and allowed personal conversation to be\ndiscussed. Staff 2 reported the conversations she heard were\nnever sexual in nature or to the level that she would let\nadministration know.\nOn 8/20/25, I attended a telephone interview with Staff 1. Staff 1\nagreed to meet with DHHS Worker in the community. Staff 1 did\nnot have a residence and was living in his car. Staff 1 reported he\nwas terminated from his position at the facility. Staff 1 was not\ncompletely sure why he was terminated but they had told him\nthere were “several violations.” Staff 1 reported he was a floater\nmostly on the boys’ unit. He would sometimes complete “wing\nrestrictions” where a youth would be placed in their room and he\nwould sit on the outside supervising. Staff 1 reported he knew a\ngrievance was filed on him by Youth A for making a shower\ncomment about a mop. Staff 1 reported he has everyone mop up\nafter showers because the youth pee in the showers. Staff 1\nreported he never had 1 on 1 conversations with Youth A or Youth\nB. Staff 1 reported Youth B never had a conversation with him\npersonally. Staff 1 reported she would just come around the table\nwhere he would be when playing chess, but that was it. Staff 1\nreported he had “life conversations” with the youth. They (youth in\ngeneral) would talk to him about their life outside of the facility and\nwhat they are going to do when they leave. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA talked about where she was going to live when she left the\nfacility, which was at her girlfriend’s. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nwould talk in a sexual nature about her girlfriend and another\nwoman. Staff 1 reported he would not engage in that\nconversation, but he also didn’t stop it. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nwanted him to use his Instagram account to send a message to\nher girlfriend. Staff 1 reported he did not do that. Staff 1 reported\nhe never received Youth A or Youth B’s Instagram account or\ngave out his. Staff 1 reported he has played basketball in the gym\nwith the youth but never talked about “lube” with any youth. Staff 1\nreported he was in a relationship with Staff 2, and it was romantic.\nStaff 1 reported the boys asked him if Staff 2 wore underwear and\nhe would not engage with the conversation. Staff 1 reported he\ndidn’t engage in the conversations the youth had but allowed them\nto talk. When they were done, he would change the topic.\nThe following youth were interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/20/25 by me:\n5",
    "Youth C, Youth D, Youth E, and Youth F all reported they have\nbeen staffed by Staff 1. All reported they have never heard Staff 1\nstate inappropriate sexual comments to them or to the females on\nthe unit. All reported he was never alone with females on the unit.\nAll reported they never saw him close or touching females on the\nunit. None of the youth knew where he lived or what his phone\nnumber was nor his Instagram account.\nYouth C and Youth D reported they could talk to Staff 1 about their\nlives, and he would listen.\nVideo Observation:\nThe grievance was filed on 6/30/25 by Youth A. Due to Youth B\nreporting the conversations happened about a “week or two ago” I\nreviewed the schedule for Staff 1 in the month of June. He was\nonly scheduled on 6/27/25 and 6/29/25 with Youth A and Youth\nB’s pod; therefore, these dates were watched. Staff 1’s shifts were\nfrom 2:30pm-10:30pm. It should be noted the video does not have\naudio.\n6/27/25: Staff 1 never interacted with Youth A or Youth B. Youth A\nwas in wing restriction and he was not the staff supervising her.\n6/29/25: Staff 1 is seen playing cards with Youth D at the table in\nthe unit and both Youth A and Youth B are not near them or\nengaged in any type of conversation with them. At 7:37pm, Staff 1\nis in the gym with the unit and playing basketball. He sits down at\na table and Youth A and Youth B sit on both sides of him. Staff 1\nis never seen wiping his forehead and showing them anything on\nhis hands. Staff 1 sits on the sidelines while the group is playing\nbasketball. He sits there until 7:50pm and gets up. Youth B leaves\nand then Staff 1 and Youth A are standing there until 8:13pm.\nDuring this time, they are engaged in a conversation. Staff 1 is at\nan acceptable distance from them and there are no sexual\ngestures seen. After this there is no other interaction until 9:30pm.\nYouth A comes out of the bathroom, Staff 1 and Youth A\nexchange words quickly and she goes back into the bathroom.\nThat was the last interaction Staff 1 had with Youth A.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n• Youth A’s face sheet. Youth A was placed on 6/16/25.\n• Youth B’s face sheet. Youth B was placed at the facility\non 6/8/25.\n6",
    "• Youth A’s grievance signed on 6/3025, received by\nClinical Director on 7/4/25.\n[Staff 1] has had a lot of inappropriate conversations with\nme mainly all sexual he also stated to me and I quote\n“when you leave out of here, you’ll be 18 and you could\ncome live with me.” He also said to me, “did you clean the\nfloor up someone might slip known what you do in there.”\nHe said this, because of an earlier conversation where I\nstated [the shower] has two shower heads one up top and\nthe bottom. I also stated that’s the only place I’m a do some\nsexual at.”\n• Incident Report: Youth B did not file a grievance, but Staff\n2 wrote the Incident report dated 7/3/25, when both Youth\nA and Youth B sat down with her during her shift and both\nexplained Staff 1’s behaviors. The Incident report noted\nStaff 1 had made inappropriate comments towards them,\nmaking them uncomfortable. He exchanged social media\ninformation, told them they could live with him, and\ndiscussed sexual comments about “lube.”\n• Personal Boundaries Policy. The policy states that all\nemployees are to maintain professional boundaries.\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: All criminal clearances were up to\ndate with the last one completed on 10/23/24. Training was\nup to date and Staff 1’s most recent boundary training was\ncompleted on 10/24/24. Staff 1 resigned on 7/12/25.\n• Instagram accounts were looked up and none of the\naccounts were following each other.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Staff schedule, video\nobservation, and interviews with Supervisor and multiple youth\nreveal Staff 1 physically had boundaries with Youth A and Youth\nB. Multiple youth interviewed never noted Staff 1 as having\ninappropriate conversations and reported he was never alone with\nfemale youth.\nVideo observation does not provide many interactions with the\nyouth. Only during the basketball game is Staff 1 seen sitting near\nthe youth, but there is no audio to determine if there were\ninappropriate conversations and both Youth A and Youth B did not\nreport the conversations happening in the gym. Staff 1 is not seen\nwiping his forehead and showing Youth A and Youth B anything\non his hands.\n7",
    "Staff 1 denied stating he asked the youth to move in with him and\nno other youth or staff witnessed this.\nTechnical Assistance:\nStaff 1 admitted he allowed Youth A to talk about her girlfriend. He\nadmitted he thought it was inappropriate and waited for her to be\nfinished and then redirected the conversation. These actions allow\nyouth to think staff are engaged in the conversation and this type\nof conversation is appropriate. It would benefit the agency to\ndiscuss how to stop inappropriate conversations youth initiate and\nhow to ensure the youth know those topics are not appropriate. If\ninappropriate conversations are initiated and labeled as such,\nthere should be logging of the conversations so that all staff are\naware and ready to label it as inappropriate if the youth continue\nwith them in the future.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the investigative findings the facility is compliant with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n9/5/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
