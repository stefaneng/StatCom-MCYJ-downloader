DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\na. Physical Description of Facility\nGail’s House was formerly licensed as the Child Caring Institution “Gail’s House\n(CI390201232)”. “Gail’s House” requested a change in their license (CCI to TCCI) to\nreflect the change in their program services. Gail’s House is located on the east side of\nKalamazoo, in a mixed residential and industrial setting. The home is a single story\n3,300 square foot brick structure that appears to be in very good condition. The facility\nwas built in 1993 and has six individual bedrooms. The bedrooms are located near the\ntwo common bathrooms, laundry room and have a small common area where staff will\nbe stationed during the evening hours. The smaller common area is connected to the\nlarger common area by a short hallway. Within the rest of the structure, there is a large\ncommon area that serves as a recreational, dining, and social area. Located next to the\nlarge common area is the kitchen which has a partial wall providing a line of sight into\nthe common area. Also connected to this large common area is the staff office and staff\nbathroom. Another hallway leads from the large common area to a door leading to the\nattached 500 square foot two vehicle garage. The garage is used as an activity space.\nJust before the door to the garage is a storage room. There are two emergency exits in\nthe house, one in the bedroom area and the other at the other end of the building.\nOutside of the home is a fenced in playground area. The Fire Inspection was completed\nwith an “A” rating on December 14, 2016 and the Environmental Health Inspection was\ncompleted with an “A” rating on November 28, 2016.\nb. Program Description\nGail’s House will provide short-term residential services for residents who have a\nprimary mental health diagnosis and are experiencing an acute psychiatric crisis. This\ntreatment program is intended to provide short term care as an alternative to inpatient\npsychiatric services or to avert an inpatient psychiatric admission. The focus will be on\nproviding a temporary separation from the resident’s natural environment to prevent the\nrisk of deterioration of their mental health condition or harm to themselves or others.\n2",
    "Gail’s House will provide residential services to both genders of residents, covering\nage’s five to seventeen. The program will be licensed to provide care for six residents at\na time, and the assessment process will focus on keeping residents in the program that\nare in the same developmental age range. The agency believes that given the nature of\nthe program, their primary referrals with be older residents with the occasional sibling\ngroup involving younger ages. The initial assessment will be used to screen the age\nrange of the resident with a focus on accepting those of a similar developmental age\nrange. The focus for the agency will be to only accept those residents of a similar\ndevelopmental age range and similar presenting problem issues. The agency will not\nmix populations of different developmental age ranges, given the difficulties that would\nbe presented with the supervision of multiple developmental age ranges. If the agency\nencounters a referral involving a sibling group with a wide developmental age range,\nthen the appropriate staffing model will be made available. This might involve on-on-one\nsupervision for the younger resident with a more basic supervision ratio for the older\nresident. This situation is considered to be unlikely since the agency will be screening\npotential residents at the initial assessment. The general length of stay can vary and\nmay range from forty-eight hours of respite to several days, depending on the needs of\nthe resident, parent, and situation surrounding the referral. Crisis residential stays may\nnot exceed fourteen nights and will typically last two to fourteen days. The program is\ndesigned to treat residents with behaviors that are difficult to manage or that require\nconstant supervision. These behaviors are described as; verbally aggressive, property\ndestructive, noncompliance, withdrawal, and inappropriate or a lack of social skills. The\nprogram is also designed to help residents experiencing a Serious Emotional\ndisturbance (SED), having a possible diagnosis of Developmental Disability (DD), and\nsuffering unspecified trauma. The SED resident may be diagnosed with Attention\nDeficit-Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder, Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder or Intermittent Explosive Disorder.\nSome of the DD diagnoses may include one of the following: Cerebral Palsy, Autism\nSpectrum Disorder, or Intellectual Development Disorder. The focus of treatment will be\non providing a safe, nurturing, and structured environment in which the resident can\nlearn appropriate ways of coping (healing), resolving, and developing methods of\novercoming the challenges that brought them into care. Another focus of treatment is to\noffer opportunities for socialization, recreation, and skill enhancement for each resident.\nIndividualized treatment goals will be determined through the circumstances that\nbrought the resident into care, the intake assessment, and background information\nprovided by the parents and the referral source. The resident and parents will both be\ninvolved in the different skills building in an effort to help the resident’s caretaker\nunderstand positive and healthy ways of being a support for the resident. Although the\nparent will not be the primary focus, providing them with the necessary knowledge and\ntools to cope with the resident is a central focus of the program. Schooling for school\nage residents will be provided to the resident if their stay is during a school day.\nEducation will be provided by the resident’s school, local, or intermediate school district\nat established community schools as coordinated by the referring worker. If a resident is\nhomeschooled, Program staff will work with the resident to complete school work as\ndirected.\n3",
    "The treatment program at Gail’s House utilizes the Positive Behavior Support (PBS)\nsystem, which has a focus of reinforcing a resident’s positive behaviors. This treatment\nprogram also involves engaging the resident in numerous on-site and community\nactivities (depending on the age and development abilities of the resident). Activities\nthat are identified are those activities that support the treatment goals and help to build\npositive skills within the resident. On-site activities include the “Activity Center”, gym,\nand utilizing outdoor space (walking track or basketball court).\nGail’s House treatment team consists of highly trained (licensed where required)\nprofessionals (Program Director, Program Manager, Direct Care Staff Supervisor,\nClinical Staff, Specialists, Support Staff, and Direct Care Staff) with skills in treatment\nplan development, de-escalation techniques, crisis intervention, and skills development\nfor the residents. Each of the treatment staff are required to attend significant training on\ndifferent interventions and methods of positive interventions. Staff to resident ratio range\nfrom 1:1 to 1:6 during awake hours with a maximum of 1:6 during sleeping hours.\nStaffing ratios will change depending upon the need to ensure adequate supervision,\nsafety, service quality, and to facilitate positive peer interactions.\nBecause this program is being licensed as a Therapeutic Group home, the staff is fully\naware that physical management, seclusion, and the use of behavior management\nrooms are not allowed. Therefore, the administration of this program is very aware that\nteaching appropriate, non- physical intervention techniques is required. The staff will be\nprovided training in the “Mandt System” which utilizes numerous de-escalation\ntechniques and non-physical intervention methods. Oversight to the levels of staff is\nprovided, and team meetings support a strong team approach to providing services to\nthe resident and their families.\nAt this time, Gail’s House will receive referrals from two primary sources; Community\nMental Health Services Program and Private Payer.\nc. Rule/Statutory Violations\nNone\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that an initial provisional license be issued to this Child Caring\nInstitution.\n4",
