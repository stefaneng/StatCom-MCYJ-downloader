The staff has been terminated. I did not get any\nother details.\nInvestigation Complainant was emailed about further information on 1/10/2023.\nShe responded with the Chief Administrator’s phone number and\nidentifying him as being the individual who left her a voice message\nabout the incident.\nAdministrator was interviewed via telephone, on 1/10/2023. He\nreported calling Complainant with the information. He also reported\n2",
    "firing Staff 1, “the minute” he found out about the incident. Youth A is\nstill in the program on campus.\nAdministrator was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n1/11/2023. He reported understanding that the incident took place\n“towards the end of the night” on 1/6/2023. When Staff 1 informed\nYouth A that she would have to check with the supervisor before\nallowing him permission to call his mother, Youth A asked again to\nspeak to his mother. Youth A then told Staff 1 if she did not allow him to\nspeak to his mother right now, he would punch Youth B in the face.\nYouth B and Staff 1 were engaged in a conversation at that time. Youth\nA then punched Youth B causing staff to engage in separating the\nyouth. A short time later, Youth A and Staff 1 began a verbal\nconfrontation resulting in Youth A cursing at Staff 1. Staff 1 was\nreported to respond with something like “I will have someone come up\nhere and take care of you”. Supervisor and Staff 2 were present and\nwitnessed the interaction. Supervisor called Administrator and\nAdministrator told him to “remove her from the house”. Administrator\nreported Staff 1 did not work the next day and when coming into work\non Monday, he met with her and Supervisor to discuss the situation. It\nwas at this time Administrator “let her go” as an employee. He also\nreported she had no further contact with any youth after leaving work\non Friday.\nSupervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n1/11/2023. He reported Youth A and Youth B had gotten into a fight and\nwhen he arrived on the scene, staff had the youth separated. He went\ninto the office to secure another staff for the shift and when leaving the\noffice, he witnessed Youth A and Staff 1 engaged in a verbal\nconfrontation. “Youth A was blowing up and Staff 1 was screaming at\nhim.” He also reported Staff 1 was upset and said, “I’m going to get my\nbrother to come out here and he will kill you”. Staff 2 was present and\npulled Staff 1 away from Youth A. Supervisor also reported calling\nAdministrator about the situation, and he confirmed Administrator told\nhim to keep Staff 1 away from Youth A. Staff 1 took a “cool down time”\nand went to the gym with Youth B after this. He reported this all took\nplace at the end of the shift, around 10:40 pm with the shift ending at\n11:00 pm.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 1/11/2023.\nHe reported remembering the incident and how he was deescalating\nwhen Staff 1 began to yell at him. He was cursing at Staff 1 and Staff 1\nkept screaming louder at him. He stated, “Staff 1 said her brother would\ncome up and put me six feet under. Someone will come up here and kill\nyou.” He also reported Staff 1 had to be stopped by other staff because\n4",
    "she was “coming after me physically”. He is now talking to his therapist\nabout his fear of Staff 1’s brother coming to harm him.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 1/11/2023.\nHe reported talking with Staff 1 when Youth A came up and punched\nhim “out of the blue”. He also reported knowing nothing else about the\nsituation and was removed from the house for a while after being hit.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 1/11/2023.\nShe reported being present during the situation between Youth A and\nStaff 1 and when Youth A punched Youth B. She stated following the\nfight, “Staff 1 said she was going to have her brother come up here”.\nShe also reported not being sure of the reasons for the argument nor\nwhy Staff 1 was involving her brother. She denied any physical\naggression by Staff 1 but did believe Staff 1 was not using de-\nescalation techniques as trained. Staff 2 viewed Staff 1 as acting\ninappropriately in dealing with Youth A before being removed and\n“taken outside to calm down”.\nJJ Case Worker was interviewed on the phone, on 1/11/2023. She\nreported being made aware of the incident on 1/9/2023 by the facility.\nShe also reported having no concerns about the program and is\nspeaking with Youth A weekly. She believes he is getting his weekly\ntherapy and he has a habit of “complaining about everything he can”.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on the phone, on 1/17/2023. She reported\nbeing terminated from her employment at the facility on 1/9/2023\nbecause she had a “heated argument with Youth A”. She was unable to\nrecall specifically what she said but admitted she said something\ninappropriate to make herself feel better. She also reported she had let\nher anger get the best of her in the “heat of the moment”.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nStaff 1’s HR file was reviewed. She is current on her training as\nrequired. Other documents within this file included:\n• Verbal Reprimand email dated 12/6/2022. This reprimand was the\nresult of a youth reporting Staff 1 had made unneeded comments and\nwas antagonistic towards him. She admitted to these claims. She was\ninformed of disciplinary action if similar behavior occurred in the future.\n• Performance review dated 1/22/2022 was reviewed. This covered a\ntime of 1/22/2021 to 1/22/2022 and was documented as an” annual”\nreview. “Teamwork and communication” are documented as “needing\nimprovement”. Her goals consisted of the development of self-\n4",
    "awareness and being more mindful of body language and verbal\npresentation when interacting with Youth under high stress.\n• Termination letter dated 1/9/2023. This letter was in the file and\ndocumented her employment was terminated on 1/9/2023. The reasons\nfor the terminated are noted as, “An altercation with Youth A on\n1/6/2023”. Her behavior is documented as resulting in a “type A\nmisconduct”. The other reason for her termination involves an\naltercation between herself and other youth during December 2022.\nDiscipline policy/procedures without a date. This document outlines\n“unacceptable consequences” with working with the youth in care.\nVerbal abuse is listed as one of the unacceptable consequences.\nUpdated Residential Treatment Plan with a report period of 7/26/22\nto 10/21/22. This document outlines the treatment goals for Youth A\nand these goals address the presenting problems identified. His\nprogress/lack of progress is documented as are the objects and staff's\nintervention in helping him achieve his goals.\nVideo Recording dated 1/6/23 at 10:26 pm. The video recording is of\nthe common area in the house where Youth A is lodged. In the opening\nscene Youth A, is walking around the room next to Staff 2 and he is\nusing significant arm gestures suggesting he is upset. Staff 1 is\nstanding in a doorway. Approximately 30 seconds later, Staff 1 leaves\nthe doorway and walks towards Youth A and Staff 2. Staff 1 appears to\nbe making numerous gestures with her arms suggests being upset\nbefore Staff 2 stands between Staff 1 and Youth A. Staff 2 pushes Staff\n1 out of the room and Staff 1 continues with her arm/hand gestures\ntowards Youth A. Staff 1 exits the scene 10 seconds later.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews and video recording, there is evidence to\nsupport Staff 1 engaged in verbally abusive language and gestures\nwhen interacting with Youth A on 1/6/2023.\nIt should be noted, the facility took appropriate action with Staff 1 once\nAdministrator was made aware of her behaviors. She was separated\nfrom Youth A and had no further contact with any of the youth after the\nend of her shift the day of the incident. There is no technical assistance\nor consultation because the facility is self-reporting in an effort to stay in\ncompliance with licensing rules.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the that the current license status be continued.\n01/26/2023\n_________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n01/26/2023\n__________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n4"
