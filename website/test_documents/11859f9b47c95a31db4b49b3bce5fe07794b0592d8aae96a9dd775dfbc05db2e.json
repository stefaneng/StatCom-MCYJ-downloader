METHODOLOGY\n11/26/2019 Special Investigation Intake\n2020C0114009\n11/26/2019 Special Investigation Initiated - Letter\nEmail to complainant\n11/26/2019 Contact - Face to Face\nInterview complainant\n01/06/2020 Contact - Face to Face\nInterview staff\n01/06/2020 Contact - Document Received\n02/03/2020 Contact - Face to Face\nInterview staff\n02/20/2020 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\n02/20/2020 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that an adoption took 18 months to complete.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn November 26, 2019 a special investigation was initiated into the allegations\ndescribed above. A foster parent and agency staff were interviewed. Documents\nwere received and reviewed. What follows is information obtained from the\naforementioned sources.\n2",
    "On November 26, 2019 Foster Parent 1 was interviewed. She offered the following\ninformation. The agency started work on the adoption in May 2018 and the adoption\nwas not finalized until October 10, 2019. Foster Parent 1 reported that the agency\nwould lose paperwork and there were multiple changes in adoption workers which\nheld up the adoption process.\nOn January 6, 2020 the Chief Administrator for the agency was interviewed. The\nChief Administrator acknowledged that the adoption process did take 18 months to\ncomplete. She reported that child assessments were not completed on time and this\nheld up the adoption process. The Chief Administrator reported that the adoption\nprocess started in March 2018 and the adoption was finalized on October 10, 2019.\nOn January 6, 2020 and February 3, 2020, the Program Supervisor was interviewed.\nThe Program Supervisor reported that the children were referred for adoption on\nMarch 26, 2018. She reported that various factors occurred which held up the\nadoption process. The Program Supervisor cited staff turnover and a failure on the\npart of the agency to complete required paperwork on time resulted in the length of\ntime for the adoptions to be finalized. The Program supervisor reported that the\nDHHS -1927 child evaluations were not competed until June 4, 2019.\nA review of the files indicate that the child assessments were not completed until\nJune 4, 2019. The children were referred for adoption on March 29, 2018.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12708 Child evaluation.\n(1) A social service worker shall complete a written\nassessment of each child available for adoption\nwithin 60 days of the child being referred for\nadoption. The assessment shall include all\ninformation available in the foster care file from the\ndate the child entered care and shall meet all\nrequirements of section 27 of 1939 PA 288, MCL\n710.27.\nANALYSIS: The children were referred for adoption on March 29, 2018. The\nchild assessments were not completed until June 4, 2019, a\nperiod of 14 months beyond the 60 day time frame as required\nby the rule. This factor contributed to the 18 months it took to\ncomplete the adoption process.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",
    "ALLEGATION:\nIt is alleged that the foster parent was not receiving payment for the children in her\ncare.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the onsite visit on February 3, 2020 the Chief Administrator provided me with\na series of emails that occurred between the Iosco/Alcona DHHS office and Child\nand Family Services Northeast. An email dated November 18, 2019, from a BSC 1\nLeader to interagency DHHS personnel and the agency Chief Administrator\nindicates that payment for 10-11 days for one of the children in the care of the Foster\nParent 1 was withheld. The email indicates payment was interrupted because the\nlocal office was unable to amend a service authorization. An email dated December\n5, 20019 from the BSC 1 Leader to interagency DHHS personnel and the agency\nChief Administrator indicates that the service authorization was amended but the\nBSC 1 Leader could not tie in a funding source to allow for reimbursement. An email\ndated December 5, 2019 from DHHS Worker 1 indicates that the funding source\nproblem was resolved. An email dated December 5, 2019, from the BSC 1 Leader to\ninteragency DHHS personnel and the agency Chief Administrator indicates that\npayments should show overnight. An email dated December 6, 2019 from the BSC 1\nLeader to interagency DHHS personnel and the agency chief Administrator indicate\nthat payments for the foster child are pending to CFSNE for the September 30, 2019\nto October 9, 2019 time period.\nDuring the February 3, 2020 on site visit the Chief Administrator provided me with\ndocumentation of a Chemical Bank check from Child and family Services Northeast\npayable to Foster Parent 1 for a sum of $665.64. The Chief Administrator reported\nthat this check was provided to Foster Parent 1 to compensate and assist the family\nuntil the funding problem was resolved. An email dated November 19, 2019 from the\nChief Administrator to Foster Parent 1 asks the Foster Parent 1 if they had received\nthe agency check. An email dated November 19, 2019 from Foster Parent 1 to the\nChief Administrator states they received the check and they thanked the agency.\n4",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 903-03 Payment for foster family/relative care\nPayments for the care of a child in a placement from child care\nfund (CCF), state ward board and care (SWBC), title IV-E, limited\nterm emergency foster care and Unaccompanied Refugee Minor\n(URM) fund sources are routed, approved and amended in\nMISACWIS. For age appropriate rates see FOM 905-3, Foster\nCare Rates.\nThe entire rate paid to the placement agency foster care (PAFC)\nprovider for maintenance, clothing allowance and any\ndetermination of care (DOC) shall be paid by the PAFC provider to\nthe foster families/relatives providing the care.\nANALYSIS: Evidence indicates that the failure of payment to the foster\nparent for the time period from September 30, 2019 to October\n9, 2019 was due to a systemic problem beyond the control of\nthe agency. The agency was working closely with the BSC 1\nLeader to correct the problem which was accomplished on\nDecember 5, 2019. In the interim the agency provided Foster\nParent 1 with a check to cover child care expenses until the\nproblem was resolved.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe Chief Administrator reported that due to the length of time, the foster\nparent/adoptive family fingerprints for Foster Parent 1 had expired and the foster\nparent had to be re-fingerprinted. and this also held up the adoption process. The\nChief Administrator reported that the adoption process started in March 2018 and\nthe adoption was finalized on October 10, 2019.\nThe Program Supervisor also reported that the adoptive parent fingerprints had\nexpired on June 7, 2019 and the parents were not re-fingerprinted until July 24,\n2019.\nThe file indicates that fingerprints for Foster Parent 1 had expired on June 7, 2019.\nFingerprints were then completed on July 24, 2019.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nSRM - 200 Fingerprints\nFingerprints are required for all individuals applying to\nbecome licensed foster parents or adoptive parents in the\nstate of Michigan, in addition to chief administrators and\nlicensee designees of Child Placing Agencies (CPA) and\nChild Caring Institutions (CCI).\nANALYSIS: The foster/adoptive family fingerprints expired on June 7, 2019\nand the parents were not re-fingerprinted until July 24, 2019.\nThis factor also contributed to the length of time it took to\ncomplete the adoption process.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan the recommendation is for\ncontinuance of the regular license.\nFebruary 21, 2020\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 21, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
