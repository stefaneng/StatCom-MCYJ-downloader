    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program Statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nDescription program statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff allegedly hugged and kissed a youth. Staff allegedly sent\nyouth a picture of his genitals.\nInvestigation On 8/30/23, I interviewed Complainant 1. No new information was\nprovided.\nThere is no video of the allegations.\nYouth A was in the facility previously and was discharged on\n6/7/23. She then returned to the facility on 7/6/23. This incident is\nsaid to have occurred on two different time frames. The picture of\nthe genitals is said to have occurred after Youth A’s discharge on\n6/7/23 and the kiss occurred on 8/27/23.\nInterviews:\nOn 8/30/23, I interviewed Administrator 1. Administrator 1 reported\nthat Staff 1 is a good staff who does a lot of things for the agency.\nAdministrator 1 reported that Staff 1 did kiss Youth A, but in a\n“fatherly” manner. Administrator 1 reported that Staff 1 did admit\nthis to him when he talked to Staff 1. Administrator 1 reported that\nStaff 1 does not have discipline in his file.\nDue to police involvement all interviews were stopped until\nSeptember 8, 2023. Police determined they are not pursuing.\nAll interviews were conducted with DHHS unless otherwise noted.\nOn 9/25/23, I interviewed Youth A. Youth A reported she has an\n“on and off” relationship with the staff that work with her. Youth A\nreported it is due to her behaviors. Sometimes she gets along with\nstaff and sometimes she does not. Youth A reported that Staff 1\nwould give her side hugs, whisper in her ears when hugging her.\nYouth A reported that Staff 1 told her she was pretty and kind\nbefore. Youth A reported that Staff 1 gave her his phone number\n2",
    "in June 2023. Youth A reported she texted Staff 1 and asked what\nhe wanted, and Staff 1 sent her a picture of his genital area. Youth\nA reported she thinks it was an internet picture, not his personal\ngenital area. Youth A reported she does not know her phone\nnumber, or Staff 1’s phone number and does not have the phone\nanymore. Youth A reported that was the only contact via text\nbetween Staff 1 and herself. Youth A was asked if she showed\nanyone this picture and she stated her sister. Youth A reported\nthat her sister wouldn’t tell anyone about it though, because her\nsister is “loyal” to her. Youth A reported she did not tell anyone\nabout the text at the facility. Youth A reported that on 8/27/23 she\ntold Staff 1 that she may be leaving the facility soon and Staff 1\ngave her a side hug and then kissed her on the cheek. Youth A\nstated it “weirded” her out. Youth A reported that staff are not\nallowed to hug but he always hugged her.\nYouth B, Youth C, Youth D, and Youth E all reported they have\nnever seen Staff 1 hug anyone. All reported that staff are not\nallowed to hug anyone.\nStaff 2 reported she has never seen Staff 1 hug Youth A or show\nher special treatment. Staff 1 reported there were times that Youth\nA was the only youth on her pod so she might have felt that Staff 1\nwas giving her special attention because he had to come to every\npod and check on them. Staff 1 reported that Youth A did come to\nher and stated the allegations to her. Staff 1 reported that Youth A\ntold her Staff 1 hugged her and kissed her on the cheek because\nhe thought she was leaving the facility. Staff 2 reported it is not\ncommon practice to hug youth and to kiss youth.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A has been with the agency on and off.\nStaff 1 reported that Youth A does has behavioral issues and that\nthey tend to focus on wanting good shifts, so the staff are to “push\nher along” and “keep her happy.” Staff 1 reported he only sees her\nmedication administration time and at dinner. Staff 1 reported that\nthis time around in the agency she has not had as many\nbehavioral issues but in the past she has. Staff 1 reported he gave\nYouth A side hugs. Staff 1 reported that when Youth A reported\nthat she was leaving the facility on 8/27/23, that he was extremely\nhappy that she was finally leaving that he went to hug her, and\nYouth A got up and jumped into him. Staff 1 reported that instead\nof a side hug, it became a frontal hug. Staff 1 reported that when\nhe went to pull away from the hug, his lips brushed up against her\ncheek. Staff 1 reported he did not mean to kiss her. It was not\nintentional. Staff 1 reported he has never given her his phone\nnumber and never sent pictures to her.\n3",
    "Documents:\nI reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. All clearances and trainings\nwere up to date. Staff 1’s performance evaluation was completed\nand no issues were noted.\nI reviewed the “Examples of Unprofessional Boundaries” Policy:\nProhibited activities and relationships that are indicative of an\nunprofessional relationship include but are not limited to:\n• Establishing inappropriate boundaries with residents where\nin the boundaries of a staff/resident relationship are blurred\nDHHS Worker reported there are no findings in his investigation.\nAnalysis Administrator 1 reported that Staff 1 did express he kissed Youth\nA (in a nonsexual manner). Youth A reported Staff 1 kissed her\nand Staff 1 reported he accidently kissed her. This is in violation of\nthe “Unprofessional Boundaries” policy. It was also noted by Staff\n2 and Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, and Youth D that staff do not\nhug youth and that they do not see staff doing this. Staff 1\nreported he does hug Youth A. Although this particular behavior is\nnot outlined as inappropriate, Staff 1 did not display this behavior\nto other youth; therefore, having the appearance that there was a\nspecial relationship between Staff 1 and Youth A.\nThere is no evidence to validate Staff 1 gave youth A his phone\nnumber or sent text pictures to Youth A.\nTechnical Assistance: Although hugging is not outlined in policy\nas something staff cannot do, staff are to use discretion when\nusing this form of touch. It appears from interviews that hugging is\nsomething that is not common from staff to youth. A training\ndiscussing appropriate boundaries outlining history of youth and\nappropriate times to use different touches should be discussed.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n4",
