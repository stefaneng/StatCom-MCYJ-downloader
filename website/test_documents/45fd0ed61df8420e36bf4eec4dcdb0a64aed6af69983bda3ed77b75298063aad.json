    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth O brought knives into the facility.\nInvestigation I notified Complainant, also Youth N’s School Principal, that I was\nassigned this complaint. She did not express any additional\nconcerns regarding Methodist Children’s Home.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI notified Youth N’s Foster Care Worker that I was the DCWL\nConsultant assigned to investigate the allegations. He expressed\nno additional concerns.\nOn 9/13/23 I notified Chief Administrator (CA) of the allegations\nvia phone and requested names, incident reports, policies, and\nstaff schedules.\nI arrived at the facility unannounced on 9/14/23 and reviewed\nincident reports pertaining to knives and toy cap guns being\nconfiscated.\nOn 8/28/23 Residential Director wrote the following:\n“Residents informed this writer that Youth A was possibly in\npossession of a knife. This writer and Supervisor discovered the\nknife on Youth A and confiscated it.”\nI reviewed three additional reports by Supervisor dated 9/8/23. To\nsummarize, Youths A, O and N returned from AWOL together and\nSupervisor confiscated three knives hidden outdoors and two toy\ncap guns from Youth O’s and A’s pockets.\nI interviewed Residential Director who has worked at the facility\nover one year. He said on 8/28/23, Youth C informed him that\nYouth A was in possession of a knife. Residential Director and\nSupervisor asked Youth A to empty his pockets and Youth A\npulled out a folding knife. Residential Director provided a photo of\n2",
    "the knife confiscated from Youth A. It was a folding knife\napproximately 6-inches long extended with a pointed tip and\njagged edge. Residential Director said Youth A was admitted to\nthe facility on 8/9/23 and had not been off campus except for a\nstaff supervised off-grounds activity to Dollar Tree on 8/27/23.\nI asked Residential Director how and when youths are searched\nfor contraband. He said after returning from school in the\ncommunity, if they have a bag, it is searched. Upon returning\nfrom AWOL or a home visit, staff wand youth with a metal\ndetector. Staff do not search youths when they return from an off-\ngrounds staff supervised activity.\nI reviewed the facility’s search policy. It indicates youths can be\nsearched upon 1) return from school, 2) return from afterschool\nactivities, 3) return from AWOL, 4) return from a visit off grounds\n(supervised or unsupervised), 5) return from on grounds\nunsupervised visits and 6) probable cause which includes\ninformation or suspicion.\nI reviewed the facility’s policy for supervising youth while off-\ngrounds. It indicates staff are expected to be aware of the youth’s\nwhereabouts and within arms-length and earshot of staff. Staff\nmay not leave a youth unattended in the community for any length\nof time.\nI interviewed Supervisor who has worked at Methodist for three\nmonths and has two years of experience at another child caring\ninstitution. Supervisor said Youth A gave up the knife when asked\nto on 8/28/23. He also recalled searching all of Youth A’s\nbelongings upon admission and said there was no knife.\nOn 9/8/23, Supervisor said he searched Youth’s O, A and N upon\ntheir return from AWOL. “Youth A produced a cap gun and did not\nsay where he got it. Youth O reached in his pants and gave up a\nsecond cap gun. Youth N confessed there were knives hidden\nbehind the cottage and took me to them. Youth N told me the\nknives and cap guns came from Dollar Tree. Youth N said Youths\nA and O ‘made’ him steal the knives while AWOL.”\nResidential Director provided photos of the three knives and toy\ncap guns that were confiscated on 9/8/23. The knives were the\nsame type as the single knife confiscated from Youth A on\n8/28/23.\n3",
    "I interviewed Youth N, age 13. He admitted that he, Youth O and\nYouth A “stole a bunch of stuff (two cap guns, two hair dyes and\nthree knives) the last time we went to Dollar Tree on Six Mile Rd.”\nYouth N said Youths A and O removed the plastic covering from\nthe knives inside the Dollar Tree bathroom and referred to his\npeers as “professionals at AWOLing and stealing.” Upon\nreturning from AWOL, Youth N said Youth A hid the knives\noutdoors behind a cottage.\nI interviewed Youth O, age 11. He said the knives and cap guns\nwere stolen on 9/8/23 and blamed Youth A for stealing them.\nYouth O was unwilling to provide additional information.\nI interviewed Youth A, age 11. He denied stealing anything from\nthe store on 9/8/23 and instead blamed Youths O and N. Youth A\ntold a story about Youths O and N dressed in all black and\nwearing Halloween masks when they entered Dollar Tree while\nYouth A remained outside. When I asked Youth A about the knife\nthat was found on his person on 8/28/23, he became angry and\nstormed out of the interview room. As I walked to my car, I saw\nResidential Director verbally de-escalating Youth A outdoors.\nYouth A glared at me and uttered obscenities at me as I drove\naway.\nAnalysis Youth A has only left the property twice since he was admitted on\n8/9/23, once on 8/27/23 and a second time when AWOL on\n9/8/23. The first time off-grounds was on 8/27/23, for a staff\nsupervised off-grounds activity to Dollar Tree. On 8/28/23 a knife\nwas confiscated from Youth A’s person based on information\nprovided to staff by another resident on that date. It can be\nreasonably concluded that Youth A stole this knife during his first\ntrip to the Dollar Tree. However, there is no indication staff did not\nfollow the agency’s policies and procedures.\nOn 9/8/23, Youths A, O and N returned from AWOL, and three\nknives and two toy cap guns were found outdoors on the property.\nOne or more of the youths admitted stealing the contraband from\nDollar Tree and hiding it outdoors until it was confiscated by staff.\nA review of the facility’s search procedures indicates staff followed\nthe policy for searching youths.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "Rule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nSection The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for\nthe continual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth O forced Youth N to perform oral sex.\nWhile AWOL together, Youth O exposed his private parts to\nYouths N and A.\nInvestigation Residential Director said he moved Youth O to another cottage on\n9/11/23 after learning sexual contact may have occurred between\nYouths O and N while they were AWOL together on 9/8/23. He\nestimated the boys were out of staff sight for 50 minutes before\nthey returned to campus. Residential Director said Youth N did\nnot tell anyone at the facility, but instead told his School Principal\nthat Youth O exposed himself or forced him to perform oral sex in\nthe woods.\nWhen the boys went AWOL, Residential Director and Supervisor\nsaid Staff 1 and 2 followed the agency’s supervision and AWOL\npolicies.\nYouth N admitted that on 9/8/23 he, Youths A and O went AWOL\ntogether. In the woods, “Youth O pulled down his pants and\nYouth A pushed me to his front area. I ran back to the cottage.\nYouths O and A came at me with metal poles.” Before reaching\nthe cottage, Youth N said Youth O threatened he “better not say\nanything (to staff).” Youth N cried afterward because he said he\nwas traumatized. “I told the principal at school because I can trust\nher. She’s kinder. I didn’t think the staff would care.”\nYouth N denied that any sexual touching or penetration occurred\nin the woods.\nYouth O denied removing his pants or exposing himself to his\npeers in the woods. All he said was “Youth A pushed me into\nYouth N.”\nYouth A denied that Youth O exposed himself in the woods.\n5",
    "On 9/22/23, I interviewed Staff 1 who has worked at the facility for\neight years. On 9/8/23 he said the boys were huddled up\noutdoors and then ran into the woods together. Staff 1 said he\nwalked behind them but stopped once they got deep into the\nwoods. “I called Supervisor. Staff 2 got in the van (to canvas the\narea) and I stayed back with the other kids.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 9/22/23. As he sat down, he remarked\nthat he felt as if he was about to be “interrogated by the police.” I\nexplained my role as a licensing consultant reassuring him that I\nwas not a police officer.\nStaff 2 said he has worked for the facility for five years. I asked\nhim to recall what the three youths were doing before they went\nAWOL on 9/8/23. He said he did not know. I gave him the\nincident reports he wrote pertaining to the AWOL to refresh his\nmemory. He scanned them and referred me back to the reports\nwhich lacked precipitating factors and other details. After more\nencouragement, Staff 2 said the youths ran toward the south part\nof the property and he followed them on foot. When they reached\nthe woods, he said he got in a vehicle, drove up and down Six\nMile Road searching for them for 15 – 20 minutes, then drove to\nthe police station and filed missing persons reports.\nI reviewed the facility’s AWOL policy. It indicates staff are\nexpected to make all efforts to maintain eyesight of the youth(s).\nIf youths leave the grounds, staff should get a van and follow\nthem. If youths AWOL but stay on campus and go into the woods,\nstaff should contact the supervisor, follow calmly on foot, and\nverbally attempt to return them. Staff must follow youths as far as\npossible without endangering their own safety. If youths retreat\nfurther into the woods and staff lose eyesight of them, the police\nshould be contacted, and a missing persons reports filed.\nAnalysis Staff were appropriately supervising Youths A, O and N before\nthey went AWOL and followed the facility’s AWOL policy after they\nwent AWOL.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nSeptember 26, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 27, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
