Youth B told Youth A to meet him\nin the shower and not to tell anyone or else other youth would\njump him. Out of fear, Youth A met Youth B in the shower where\nYouth B made Youth A get on his knees and perform oral sex.\nYouth B then made Youth A stand, turned him around, and rubbed\nhis private parts. Youth B then shoved \"it\" inside of Youth A who\nstarted crying. Youth B then allowed Youth A to leave out the\nshower. Youth A then went back to his own shower, cleaned\nhimself off, went to his room, and cried himself to sleep.\nOn 3/4/23, Youth B did the same thing to Youth A in the shower\nwithout force. A third similar incident occurred on an unknown\ndate at the facility, but at that time Youth B did not make Youth A\n\"suck it off.\" Staff 1 was on duty on 2/24/23 and 3/4/23 but was\nnot in proper position and did not properly supervise Youth A and\nYouth B when the incident occurred.\nInvestigation Administrator 1/Complainant was interviewed via phone, on\n4/26/2023. It was reported this sexual activity took place three\ntimes and they were able to identify video recording of two of the\nincidents. They are in the process of trying to locate the third\nincident. Both Youth B and Youth C are no longer at the facility.\nAdministrator 1 reported finding out about the additional\nallegations last Friday. He also reported Staff 1 did everything\n2",
    "correctly in supervising the youth until they began showers and\nshe positioned herself in an inappropriate location. Administrator\n1/Complainant was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n4/26/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He provided even\nfurther information about the allegations. He was told of the\nincident from Supervisor 1 who informed him Staff 3 received the\ninformation from Youth A. He reported sexual incidents took place\nthree times with Youth A, with two of them being forced and the\nthird voluntary. They have yet to identify the time of the third\nincident. He also reported meeting with Youth A to gather more\ninformation the day he was informed of the incidents (4/21/23) and\ncalling Law Enforcement after the meeting. Law Enforcement met\nwith Youth A and Staff 3 the same day. He reported having a\nPREA investigation completed and will provide a copy. He also\nprovided the video recording of the incidents. He reported the\nvideo recording on 3/4/23 shows Youth B going into the shower of\nYouth A. Administrator 1/Complainant reported speaking to Youth\nA’s father who informed him Youth A has a history of making\nseveral accusations such as being raped in the past. During his\nmeeting with Youth A, Youth A reported telling Youth D about the\nsituation but in the PREA interview, Youth D denied this every\noccurred. He reported Staff 1 informed him she had heard about\nsomething happening “a while back” but had no specifics. He has\nreviewed the video tape and Staff 1 was the staff supervising the\nunit during both incidents reported by Youth A. When reviewing\nthe video recording, he reported observing Staff 1 out of position\nand not watching the shower area. He reported she was walking\naround and doing things on the unit. He stated, “she should have\npositioned herself to watch the shower area per policy.”\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n4/26/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nbeing informed of the allegations when he received a text\nmessage from Supervisor 1 last Friday or Saturday. He reported\nan incident in the past when Youth A said another youth tried to\nkiss him but after it was investigated, the allegation was found to\nbe false. The facility did move the other youth to another unit to\nprotect Youth A. He watched the two video recordings and found\non the 2/24/23 video, Youth B was observed coming out of Youth\nA’s shower and on the 3/4/23 video, Youth B is observed entering\nand then leaving Youth A’s shower. He stated, “Staff 1 was\nworking the unit both times”. Administrator 2 suggested, the past\ninformation Staff 1 was privileged to may have been when another\nyouth attempted to kiss Youth A, but he is not fully sure. He\nreported being the supervisor who writes annual evaluations for\nStaff 1 with feedback from shift supervisors. He reported Staff 1 is\n3",
    "a newer staff having worked at the facility between six and nine\nmonths. Staff 1 just completed her six-month evaluation and he\nstated, “she would not have passed her probation period if she\nhad issues”.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n4/26/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nbeing told by Administrator 1 that “something” happened. She\nreported being told of Youth A being assaulted in the shower while\nshe was supervising the unit and she was “shocked” because she\ndoes not remember anything from those days. She was not aware\nof the incident and surprised because she has a “very good”\nrelationship with Youth A. She described her actions when\nsupervising the unit during shower time. Youth begin showers\nbetween 8:00 and 8:30 and she will let two of the youth out of their\nrooms at a time. All the other youth are locked in their rooms. Staff\n1 reported Supervisor 4 told her; she can let two youth at a time\nout while male staff are allowed to let three youth at a time take\nshowers. She reported since being told about the incident she\nnow only allows one youth to shower at a time. She understands\nshe is to sit and monitor the youth during shower time, but female\nstaff cannot sit directly in front of the shower, and she reported\nfearing someone would accuse her of looking at the youth when\nshowering. She learned the need to sit during her training. Staff 1\nreported the youth are given seven minutes to shower and during\nthis time she needs to complete notes, complete room checks\n(every 15-minutes), clean up the unit (spray off tables and chairs),\nspray off shower shoes, pass out medication if the nurse shows\nup, and sign off on and pass out snacks when the floating staff\nshows up with snacks. She reported learning to keep line of sight\nbut felt uncomfortable keeping line of sight when youth are in the\nshower. She also reported having someone speak to her over the\nintercom, telling her she cannot sit away from the shower. She\nstated, “I want a supervisor to tell me where to sit” but she has not\nhad a conversation with a supervisor until today. She also\nreported after being told by another youth that Youth C was\ntouching or asking Youth A for a kiss, she spoke to Supervisor 2\nabout this information and Youth C was moved to another unit.\nYouth A was interviewed via phone, on 5/1/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker and Law Enforcement.\nYouth A reported he does not want to talk about the incidents that\ntook place with Youth B. He then reported it occurred three\nseparate times when Youth B was in the shower next to him.\nYouth B told Youth A to come into the shower with him and “other\nstuff happened.” Youth A denied sexual actions took place with\n4",
    "any other youth at the facility. The incidents were reported to have\noccurred three times in the middle of February. Youth A at first\nreported the first time was forced and the next two were not, later\nYouth A changed this statement to report never having a choice.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 was the staff supervising the unit during\nthe first and third incidents and was unable to recall the staff\npresent during the second incident. Youth A reported youth are\npicked at random for showers and given seven minutes to shower.\nYouth A reported knowing where staff stand during shower time\nand somehow knew Staff 1 was walking around completing room\nchecks. Youth A reported other staff “do not do other things, they\njust watch us during showers.” Youth A reported he showers alone\nsince being placed in a new unit at the facility. Youth A reported\nbeing threatened by Youth B if he said anything and Youth B said,\nYouth C, Youth F, and Youth G would beat him up. Youth A\nreported the threats as “blackmailing me and threatening to stomp\nthe shit out of me and break my jaw.” These were the reasons he\ndid not report the incident. Youth A also reported everything\nwritten in the grievance form was true and accurate. Everything\ncame out when Youth A was talking to Youth D and Staff 3\noverheard their conversation. Youth A reported feeling safe at the\nfacility since moving to the new unit. He reported all staff are like\nStaff 1, “they do their job the right way”.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n5/9/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nbeing informed of the sexual assaults by Staff 3 after Staff 3 was\ninformed from Youth A and reported this information to\nadministration. Supervisor 1 spoke with Youth A after obtaining\nthis information and asked him to author a report of the incidents.\nShe found no differences between Youth A’s statement to her and\nwhat he wrote in his report. She reported Youth A stated needing\nsomeone to tell because the situation hit Youth A hard. Supervisor\n1 gave an account of staff’s process during shower time on the\nunit. Staff will choose the youth who are going to take a shower\nand should only chose one youth at a time if feeling\nuncomfortable. Staff should not be walking around. They should\nsit in a location so they can observe if youth are trying to cross the\nroom to the other shower. Staff should not be doing anything else\nwhile youth are in the shower but observe the shower area. Room\nchecks are to take place between youth showering and snacks\ncan wait until shower time is over. Supervisor 1 reported a youth\nspecialist is not allowed to pass medication and the nurse enters\nthe unit and passes medication. She also reported “Central\nControl” who monitors units should have spoken to a Shift\n5",
    "Supervisor if Staff 1 was sitting in the wrong position to monitor\nthe showers rather than saying something directly to Staff 1.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 5/9/2023\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported working as\na Youth Specialist at the facility for the past four years. She also\nreported staff have the option to have one youth at a time go into\nthe showers but if they chose to have two youth in the shower,\nthey must sit in a position so they can ensure the youth stay\nseparated. Staff are not to walk around during showers and must\nsit and monitor, “it’s just common sense.” Staff 2 reported telling\nthe nurse to wait if she has two youth in the shower and she will\nleave the snacks until she has time to pass them out. Room\nchecks are done between showers and especially not done when\nthere are two youth in the shower area. She also reported never\nworking with Staff 1 but did believe Staff 1 may have some\nboundary issues with youth since she has overheard youth call\nher “mom”. Staff 2 does not allow this and after being redirected, if\nthe youth calls her mom again, she will issue a time-out.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 5/9/2023\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported overhearing\nYouth D say to Youth A “you need to report that” twice so she\napproached them and asked what “needs to be reported.” She\nasked Youth A for details and Youth A reported being raped in the\nshower by Youth B. Staff 3 at first though it was a prior incident in\nwhich Youth C asked Youth A for a kiss, however, Youth A stated\nYouth C knew about the rape. Youth A reported to Staff 3 the\nsexual rape occurred three times but was unclear of a time for the\nincidents. Staff 3 informed Supervisor 1 who requested more\ninformation. Staff 3 gathered more information and authored a\nreport about the information provided by Youth A. Staff 3 also\ninformed Supervisor 3 about the information because Supervisor 3\ncompletes PREA reports. Staff 3 described the shower process. If\nyouth get along, Staff 3 will pick them to both shower at the same\ntime and if staff pick two youth to shower at the same time, they\nneed to sit close enough to observe if one tried to go across to the\nother shower. Staff also need to listen to the youth while in the\nshower and pay close attention because, they are not supposed to\ntalk in the showers. Staff 3 reported they try to have only one\nyouth in the shower at a time. Regarding other activities by staff\nwhile youth are in the shower, she stated, “room checks before\nand after showers, snacks before or after, and all medication is\npassed by the nurse not staff.” Staff 3 also reported it is\ninappropriate for youth to call a female staff “mom” because it\n6",
    "crosses boundaries. She did not report being aware of any\nconcerns about Staff 1.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 5/9/2023\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 4 reported being a\nliaison worker from the 180 program and working with Youth A.\nShe reported Youth A informed her of sexual harassment on the\nEcho unit and she informed Administrator 1. She informed\nAdministrator 1 about Youth C asking Youth A for a kiss but was\nunclear when this conversation occurred. She reported not\nknowing if youth showered alone after the documentation\nindicated this was recommended.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via the phone, on 5/12/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported having no\nfirsthand knowledge of the incidents of rape with Youth A in the\nshower of Echo Unit. She also reported hearing about Youth C\nasking Youth A for a kiss and to “suck his D” in a staff team\nmeeting. Youth C was moved to another unit following this\ninformation. She did not know if this information was passed to\nadministration so Youth C would be placed on “three star” statues.\nShe reported three-star status is when a youth is identified having\nsexual issues and needs to shower alone and be watched more\ndiligently.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via the phone, on 5/12/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported conducting the\nPREA investigation after receiving information on the allegations.\nShe also reported Youth A was defensive and when asked the\nsame question in a different form, gave different answers. She\nhad no prior or further interactions with Youth A. Youth A was\nmoved to a different unit after reports of being bullied. She\nprovided the following information about the youth specialist’s role\nduring shower time on the units. The youth specialist is to only\nobserve the showers when a youth is in the shower. They are\nrequired to sit and observe/monitor the showers to ensure the\nyouth are safe. When she has observed/monitored showers,\nSupervisor 3 will stand in the doorway without looking in and have\neach youth raise their hand to identify where they are in the\nshower. She will then sit so she can see their feet under the\nshower curtain and then have them come out of the shower one at\na time. She reported the youth can ask to take a shower alone\nand if they are on “three star” statues, they must take a shower\nalone. Supervisor 3 also reported Staff 1 has boundary issues with\nthe youth and Staff 1 was being groomed by an older youth at one\ntime. She was unable to provide any details other than to suggest,\n7",
    "Staff 1 likes to work with the older youth in the facility. Because\nSupervisor 3 manages the youth grievances she reported\nreceiving grievances about Staff 1 treating some youth with more\nfavor than others.\nSupervisor 4 was interviewed via the phone, on 5/12/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported working mostly\nthird shift and had almost no contact with Youth A or other youth.\nHe was informed of the allegations by Administrator 2 during a\nsupervisor meeting. He also reported being told about Youth C\nasking Youth A to kiss him and “suck his dick” in a meeting. He\ndenied speaking to Staff 1 about the number of youth she can\nhave in the shower at a time and reported she would have learned\nthis information in her training.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nJuvenile Detention Center Status Report Youth A.

This document outlines\nshowers and “clean up” were completed from 9:00 to 10:30 pm.\nRoom checks were documented as being completed every 15-\nminutes during the shower/clean up time.\nEcho Unit Log dated 3/4/23 2nd shift. This document outlines\nshowers/clean up as occurring from 9:00 to 10:30 pm. Room\nchecks were documented as being completed every 15-minutes\nduring the shower/clean up time.\nReview of video recording. A review of the video recording\ndated 3/4/2023 was completed. There are two camera views of\nthe unit shared area of the incident outlined by Youth A. The video\nbegins with Staff 1 giving something to Youth B as both are\nstanding near a table near the staff office. Youth B returns to his\nroom and a few seconds later comes out of the room and heads\ntowards the shower area. Youth A then enters the shared area\nand heads straight to the shower area following Youth B. Staff 1\nnever leaves from standing in front of the table in front of the staff\noffice. Both youth are observed entering the showers and appear\n11",
    "to follow one another into the far shower on the right side of the\nroom. Staff 1 throughout the time of the video is taking an item or\nitems from either the table or a stack of portable drawers near the\ntable and presenting them to different rooms. Some of the rooms,\nshe unlocks and others she just opens the door. Both youth are\nnot visible from either camera view and Staff 1 only twice looks in\nthe direction of the shower room door. At one point she goes\nthrough another door on the far side of the staff office but returns\nto the shared area in a few seconds. The two times she is close to\nthe shower area is to take things to the youth’s rooms who are in\nthe shower. Staff 1 can be heard yelling for both youth to end their\nshowers and when they do exit, she is sitting at the table in front\nof the staff office doing paperwork. She does not appear to look\nup as they head to their rooms. Both cameras provide the same\ninformation.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews, written documentation, and video\nrecording, evidence supports Staff 1 did not follow the facilities\nprocedures in providing protection and supervision of Youth A and\nYouth B when they were in the showers. DHHS reported Staff 1\nwill have a confirmed case.\nCONSULTATION:\nIt was recommended the facility develop a system to ensure\ninformation documented in the shift logs on an individual youth is\npassed along to all staff involved in the supervision of the youth.\nThis was also recommended to be developed in a\npolicy/procedure.\nIt was recommended when an evaluation is completed on a staff,\nall the information gathered from different supervisors be\nincorporated into the evaluation.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2021C0112030 dated 8/3/21; CAP Approved 8/27/21.\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10127 Compliance with child protection law;\nSection development of plan required.\nDescription (1) A facility shall develop and implement a written plan to assure\ncompliance with the provisions of Act No. 238 of the Public Acts of\n1975, as amended, being S722.621 et seq. of the Michigan\nCompiled Laws and known as the child protection law.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 reported being informed of Youth A being raped 15 times\nbut only informed Supervisor 4.\n12",
    "Investigation Staff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n4/26/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 1 reported\nshe was surprised of not knowing the allegations because Youth A\nhas shared issues with her since first entering the program. She\nstated, “the day Youth A entered the program and first met me\nYouth A shared his father raped him.” She reported not doing\nanything with this information other than telling Supervisor 4. She\nbelieved she did not have to take any other action with this\ninformation or the information about Youth A’s report of being\nraped fifteen times by his father.\nSupervisor 4 was interviewed via the phone, on 5/12/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He denied Staff 1 ever told\nhim about Youth A’s report of being raped fifteen times by his\nfather. Supervisor 4 reported if staff are informed of information of\nchild abuse or neglect, they are to report the incident to\nauthorities.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n5/18/2023. Youth A reported never informing any staff (Staff 1 nor\nStaff 3) about being “raped fifteen times” and stated that never\nhappened.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nMental Health History (Network 180) for Youth A dated\n1/27/2023.

The document also states\nobservations by Youth Specialists will be recorded in the youth’s\nclassification record.\nAllegation/Summary PREA investigation. Narrative dated\n4/20/23 from Staff 3. In this document, Staff 3 reported the events\nthat took place on 4/20/2023 involving Youth A. She documented\nYouth A reported being raped 15-times prior to being placed at the\nfacility. This information was passed on to the supervisor per\npolicy for reporting child abuse.\n13",
    "Analysis Based upon interviews and written documentation, evidence\nsupports Staff 1 did not follow the facilities rule 400.10127 about\nreporting suspected abuse. There is no evidence Staff 1 reported\nsuspected abuse to her shift supervisor. The report of fifteen\nrapes appears suspect since it was denied by Youth A even\nthough Staff 1 and Staff 3 reported Youth A claimed this occurred.\nStaff 3 followed the facility policy of reporting to the supervisor.\nTECHNICAL ASSITANCE:\nIt was recommended the facility update their policy regarding the\nChild Protection Law, so the policy matches what is written in the\nrules/laws. This is to ensure staff understand when learning about\nsuspected abuse or neglect they are required to report this\ninformation to authorities not just their supervisor.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2021C0112030 dated 8/3/21; CAP Approved 8/27/21.\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10123-2 Staff Sufficiency\nSection (2) A facility shall maintain a staffing ratio of at least 1 direct care\nDescription worker or supervisory staff for 8 residents at all times when the\nresidents are present and awake.

He reported at the time, Staff 1 was the only staff\nworking on the unit and the unit was on a “half up and half down\nstatus”. He described this as having half of the unit (youth) in their\nrooms thus keeping the unit in ratio. He also reported this practice\nbegan some time ago after staff called in to the point, they no\nlonger had enough staff present to supervisor the youth. There is\nno policy for this practice, and he acknowledge this is “not the\nright thing to do.” Currently, he has stopped this practice and is\nnow mandating staff for coverage.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n4/26/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nbecause of the limited staff, they were on a “half-up and half-\ndown” status and she was the only staff working on the unit that\nshift. During this shift there were fourteen youth lodged on the\nunit. This is when half of the youth stay in their rooms between\n14",

This document indicates Staff 1\nwas working this shift on the Echo unit alone.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews, written documentation evidence supports\nthe facility was not maintaining the required ratio of supervision\nwhen engaging in the “half up and half down” procedure.\nTECHNICAL ASSITANCE:\nThe facility reported stopping this practice and is currently\nmandating staff for coverage. It was recommended the facility\ndevelop this change into a policy/procedure to ensure it does not\noccur in the future.\nConclusion Violation Established\n15",
