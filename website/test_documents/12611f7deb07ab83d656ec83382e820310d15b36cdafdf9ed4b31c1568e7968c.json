    "Youth B denied seeing any peers or staff hurt Youth A. Youth B\nstated that Youth A started fights with peers and spit at people.\nYouth B never saw anyone pick on Youth A. Typically Youth A\nwas the one starting problems.\nYouth B stated that when youth go AWOL, they lose privileges,\nsuch as outings. Some youth, such as Youth A, AWOL all the time\nand do not listen to staff. Staff would follow youth for a while in the\ncommunity, then contact the police for assistance.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 9/20/24.\nYouth C was AWOL when an interview was initially attempted on\n8/19/24. Youth C reported that staff always try to talk youth out of\ngoing AWOL and will follow youth for a while through the\nneighborhood. Youth C reported that staff stop following them on\nfoot after a while, due to safety concerns. Youth C reported the\nsafety concern was due to community members not liking staff.\nWhen staff stop following on foot they will drive around and call\nlaw enforcement to assist. Youth C stated that Youth A would go\nAWOL a lot. Youth C was not aware of any peers bullying Youth\nA. Youth A often started problems with peers by spitting on them\nor getting physical with them. Youth A always had a one-to-one\nstaff that would intervene. Youth C stated that Youth A was never\nalone with other youth, and he felt it was unlikely that anyone hurt\nhim while at the facility.

Staff 1 did not\nwitness any peers bullying Youth A. Youth A had one-to-one\n4",
    "staffing and staff were very aware of the signs Youth A showed\nbefore a “blow up” occurred. Staff would attempt to remove Youth\nA from situations, but he did not always listen. Staff would also\nthen remove the other youth from the area, but Youth A would\nfollow and continue to agitate the youth. Staff 1 stated that Youth\nA can be hard to talk to and connect with at times.\nStaff 1 was aware of the bruises on Youth A, but uncertain where\nthey came from. Staff 1 indicated the marks likely occurred while\nYouth A was AWOL, as he left the facility frequently. Staff 1 stated\nthat staff discourage youth from leaving the property. However,\nYouth A does not listen. Staff have tried to use incentives to\nencourage him to stay, but he would leave anyway. Staff follow\nyouth to a designated perimeter then notify law enforcement for\nassistance. There is not a specific policy for one-to-one staffed\nyouth.\nCase Manager provided additional information on 8/30/24 via\nemail. Case Manager notified Foster Care Worker that additional\nmeetings were needed to discuss a more suitable placement for\nYouth A. Youth A’s mother was very vocal with Youth A about her\nplan to get the facility shut down, which has affected his behavior.\nYouth A has been consistently violent toward staff and made\nthreats to have the facility closed. Youth A’s mother was asked to\nrefrain from making negative comments when speaking with\nYouth A. However, she did not comply with this request. The\nfacility asked that DHHS supervise any future contact. Case\nManager reported that during a call on 8/30/24 Youth A told his\nmother about an altercation with a peer. Case Manager saw the\naltercation and felt the staff effectively managed the situation.\nHowever, Youth A’s mother became irate and threatened to come\nto the facility to confront the staff and youth involved. Youth A’s\nmother stated that a different Wolverine program had been shut\ndown and she would see to it that this one was closed as well.\nCase Manager interjected that the conversation was not\nappropriate. However, Youth A’s mother continued to yell about\ncontacting MDHHS and closing the facility. Case Manager ended\nthe call and Youth A stated, “I’m getting this place shut down.”\nCase Manager stated that staff work diligently to manage Youth\nA’s behaviors daily. Youth A spits, kicks, and uses racial slurs at\nstaff and peers on a regular basis. Youth A defecated and\nsmeared feces at the facility. These behaviors increased as\ncontact has occurred with Youth A’s mother.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility. Staff 2 stated\nthat Youth A was frequently assaultive with peers and staff. Youth\n5",
    "A was not bullied to his knowledge. Youth A had a habit of being\nthe instigator, charging at people, spitting and calling names. Staff\n2 was unsure how Youth A obtained the bruises on his arms but\nbelieved it could have occurred while AWOL. Youth A went AWOL\nseveral times over the past few weeks. Youth A never indicated\nhe was leaving because he was afraid of anyone. Staff 2 stated\nthat when youth would AWOL, staff follow for a while, then contact\nlaw enforcement for assistance. This is the protocol as community\nmembers have been threatening and violent toward staff, due to\nyouth yelling that staff are hurting them. There is not a specific\npolicy for youth that have one-to-one staffing.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility. Staff 3 stated\nthat all youth are encouraged to shower every morning and mor\noften if needed. Youth A sometimes refuses to shower. But some\nstaff have better luck with him than others. Staff 3 reported that\nYouth A instigates situations with peers by spitting and yelling\ninappropriate things at them. Staff 3 was unaware of anyone\nbullying Youth A. Staff 3 was unsure how Youth A received the\nbruises on his arm. Staff 3 stated that when youth go AWOL, staff\ntry to talk to them and encourage them to come back. Staff would\nthen follow them and call law enforcement if needed.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility. Staff 4 reported\nthat Youth A had several incidents of picking up sticks outside and\nusing them as weapons. Most youth tried to avoid Youth A, as he\nwas aggressive towards them. Staff 4 felt that Youth A was not\nbeing bullied by any peers. However, peers were upset with Youth\nA for his behavior at times. Staff 4 never witnessed any staff or\nyouth to be assaultive toward Youth A. Staff 4 reported that Youth\nA always had one-to-one staff, so it would be unlikely that\nsomething would happen without a witness. Staff 4 did not know\nwhere the bruises on Youth A’s arm came from. Staff 4 stated that\nyouth shower every day. Although, some youth refuse, despite\nstaff encouragement. Staff 4 reported the agency procedure for\nAWOL is to try to verbally redirect, then follow the youth until they\nare past the identified boundary. Staff stop following after a certain\nboundary due to community members being hostile toward staff.\nWhen staff stop following by foot, law enforcement is called to\nassist. Staff will also drive the neighborhood to look for youth at\ntimes.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 9/20/24.\nStaff 5 denied seeing any youth bully or physically assault Youth\nA. Staff 5 was unaware of the cause of any bruises on Youth A’s\narm. Staff 5 stated that Youth A went AWOL several times over\n6",
    "the past several months. When he returned, he was often very\ndirty and would shower. Staff 5 stated that when youth AWOL,\nstaff follow on foot for a block, then contacted law enforcement.\nStaff do not follow youth further because community members\nhave been threatening toward staff. Youth have told community\nmembers that staff are hurting them, which has caused people to\nyell, threaten and chase staff. Staff 5 verified there is not a specific\none-to-one policy regarding AWOL. One-to-one staff always\nstayed with youth, until they leave facility grounds and were\ndeemed AWOL.\nStaff 6 was interviewed by phone on 9/24/24. Staff 6 reported\nshe never saw anyone bully or hit Youth A. Staff 6 verified that\nYouth A would go AWOL frequently, even with a one-to-one staff.\nStaff would stay within arm’s reach of Youth A, until he left the\nneighborhood. Then law enforcement would be called. Youth A\nhad a history of refusing to shower or change his clothes, despite\nstaff attempts to encourage him to maintain his hygiene. At times,\nYouth A would return from AWOL with soiled clothing, due to\nhaving an accident. Youth are given the opportunity to shower\ntwice per day.\nStaff 7 was interviewed by phone on 9/24/24. Staff 7 stated he\nworked with Youth A several times and never saw any youth\nassault or bully him. Youth A often did things to irritate peers,\nwhich caused them to avoid him. Youth A went AWOL frequently,\neven though he had one-to-one staff, and staff would try to talk\nwith him and discourage him from leaving. Youth A did not listen\nto staff well. Youth A was also not consistent with showering and\nchanging his clothes, even though there was a reward system in\nplace.\nStaff 8 was interviewed by phone on 9/24/24. Staff 8 stated that\nYouth A would AWOL frequently and staff would follow him until\nthey could no longer maintain line of sight. Youth A would often\nreturn from AWOL very dirty, then shower. All youth are\nencouraged to shower every morning. Staff 8 stated that Youth A\nwas not bullied by peers. Typically, Youth A was the one irritating\nothers and trying to get them to go after him. Youth A’s one-to-one\nstaff was always with him and would intervene if anything\nhappened and call for assistance if needed.\nStaff 9 was interviewed by phone on 10/28/24. Staff 9 never\nheard Youth A indicate he was going AWOL due to bullying. Staff\n9 stated that Youth A would go AWOL often to smoke or look for\nalcohol, not because of peer relationships. Staff 9 recalled that\n7",
    "Youth A was typically the one causing problems with peers and\nstaff would always intervene and remove youth from the situation.\nWhen Youth A went AWOL staff would follow until they lost line of\nsight, then contact law enforcement.\nStaff 10 was interviewed by phone on 10/28/24. Staff 10 never\nheard Youth A complain of being bullied. Staff 10 never saw Youth\nA being bullied. Youth A was typically the instigator in problems\nwith peers. Youth A had a 1:1 and staff would separate youth\nwhenever there was an issue. When Youth A would go AWOL\nstaff would follow until he was out of sight then contact the police.\nStaff 11 was interviewed by phone on 10/28/24. Staff 11 stated\nthat several peers were triggered by Youth A’s behaviors and\nwould react when he would do things to bother him. Youth A and\npeers would argue back and forth. Staff would intervene and\nbreak up any verbal situation before it became physical. Youth A\nwould go AWOL frequently. However, Staff 11 did not believe\nbullying was the reason Youth A went AWOL. When Youth A\nwould leave the facility, staff would follow until they lost line of\nsight. Staff would contact law enforcement after following the\nyouth for fifteen minutes, or when they lost line of sight.\nDocuments reviewed\n• Foster Care record indicated Youth A was placed at the\nfacility from 6/19/24 to 10/11/24. Youth A went AWOL 69\ntimes during that placement.\n• Agency Policy regarding truancy does not address one-to-\none staffing. The policy states the following:\no Staff will make efforts to verbally redirect the\ntruanting client and offer support and alternatives to\ntruancy.\no Staff will immediately notify the supervisor on duty\nwhen line of sight is lost, no later than 15 minutes\nfrom loss of line of sight (when youth is determined\nAWOL).\no Supervisor will ensure law enforcement is notified as\nsoon as youth is determined AWOL.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as staff and youth consistently\nreported that Youth A was not bullied by peers and was given\ndaily opportunity to shower. Youth A reported no peers hurt\nhim. Youth A was unsure where the bruises and scratches came\nfrom.\n8",
