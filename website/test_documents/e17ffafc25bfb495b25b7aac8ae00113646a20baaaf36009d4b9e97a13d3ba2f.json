    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe facility has requested and received a licensing change. They were licensed as\na Therapeutic Child Caring Institution and are now licensed as a Child Caring\nInstitution. This change allows the facility to use approved Behavior management\ntechniques to ensure the safety of youth in their program, which was not allowed\nunder the old license. The facility will also provide shelter care services through a\nshelter care contract.\nIII. Methodology\n8/21/2019 Letter from facility requesting license type change\n8/29/2019 On-site meeting at the facility with Chief Administrator and\nExecutive Director\n8/29/2019 On-site inspection completed\n9/19/2019 Contact - Document Received\nProgram Procedure Manual\n9/19/2019 Contact - Document Received\nReceived Environmental Health Inspection report “A” rating\n9/19/2019 Contact - Document Received\nBehavior Management information\n9/19/2019 Full compliance with Licensing Rules\n10/15/19 Behavior Management Techniques approved\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe facility provided a new program description which includes the changes in the\ntreatment program.\nGail’s House will provide Shelter Foster Care Services for four females primarily\naged 10-15 years old (through exception the ages may be 5-17 and the number\nmay increase to 6 females) who are unable to be placed in a family foster home\nand need temporary placement due to several issues. The issues include:\n2",
    "a. Child presents at removal with significant behavioral challenges or\nother complex factors requiring a comprehensive assessment to\neither reunify or select an out-of-home placement.\nb. Child is currently on a waiting list for a long-term residential program.\nc. Child is in the process of stepping down from hospitalization.\nd. Child has a documented severe score on the Mental Health and\nWell-Being item on the Child Assessment of Needs and Strengths\nwithin the past 90 days and has repeated placement instability and a\nmore thorough assessment is needed to either reunify or make a\nstable next placement.\nGail’s House will accept crisis placement 24-hours a day, 7 days a week and 365\ndays a year. The facility will not reject any youth referred by any MDHHS County\nOffice, PAFC agency, RPU or 24-Hour Unit. The program will be licensed to\nprovide care for six residents at a time in a safe residential environment.\nAt the time of placement, the facility will provide a safe residential environment\nwith a focus on evaluation for services. This will involve gathering information in\norder to facilitate service planning and placement stability.\nEach child will receive a bio-psychosocial assessment upon entry to the shelter\nincluding family members if possible. They will be administrated the Child\nAssessment of Needs and Strengths (CANS) along with the Casey life skills\nassessment. These screening tools will be used to assess the level of supervision\nthe child will need to ensure a safe and nurturing environment is provided. The\nfacility will provide one-on-one supervision of youth if it is determined that this level\nis required. This will be coordinated with the referring agency. At the time of entry\nto the shelter, the initial planning for discharge / transition will begin. The expected\nlength of stay is 30-days, as stated in the contract, but exceptions will be made.\nExceptions can occur if the referring agency is having difficulty finding a treatment\nprogram placement for the youth.\nThe facility will provide the following services for youth in their care:\n Positive Behavioral Supports structured lessons (PBS)\n TARGET focused activity (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide to Education\nand Therapy)\n Clinical Case Management and Crisis Counseling (Family therapy also\noffered)\n Educational activities aimed at keeping the student current with each home\nschool district or arrange for attendance at the local school\n Structured recreational physical activities\n Structured recreational activities such as art projects, team building, and\ngames\n3",
    " Support of family and sibling visits\n Support of family participation in Family Team Meetings (FTM)\n Coordination of Medical/Dental care as needed\n Discharge planning\nBecause the facility is a 6-bed facility, the staffing ratio is designed to be 1:4 or 2:6\nduring awake hours and 1:6 during sleeping hours. If it is determined that a\nresident requires a higher level of supervision, the facility will provide if necessary\n1:1 ratio for those residents. This increased level of supervision will be coordinated\nwith the referring worker and have an ongoing evaluation of the need. Structure is\nprovided for the children while in the program which includes monitoring and\nsupervision through direct contact, eyes on and verbal communication.\nGail’s House treatment team consists of highly trained (licensed where required)\nprofessionals (Program Director, Program Manager, Direct Care Staff Supervisor,\nClinical Staff, Specialists, Support Staff, and Direct Care Staff) with skills in\ntreatment plan development, de-escalation techniques, crisis intervention, and\nskills development for the residents. Each of the treatment staff are required to\nattend significant training on different interventions and methods of positive\ninterventions. The facility will have a Licensed Therapist available on site and/or\non call for crisis counseling. The facility also has an active camera system that will\nprovide additional support for residents and staff.\nUpon admission to the shelter, each resident will undergo a complete assessment\nby the facility so a 7-calendar day preliminary assessment and plan can be\ndeveloped. This involves an assessment which is individualized, strength-based,\ntrauma informed, family-focused, culturally responsive assessment that informs\nand guides service delivery and discharge planning. Assessments are conducted\nface-to-face and include an assessment of natural supports and resources.\nAssessments and plan will include:\n A comprehensive assessment of the child’s physical/mental health needs\n An assessment of the child’s immediate and specific needs and diagnosis\n The specific services to be provided by the contractor and other resources\nto meet the identified needs\n Goals, outcomes and timeframes for achievement\n Placement recommendation\n Barriers to achievement of the recommended placement and plans to\neliminate barriers.\nFollowing admission to the facility, the therapist will work with identified individuals\nsignificant to the resident in the development of the 20-calendar day report. Each\nplan will include the following items:\n A psychiatric history, as necessary\n4",
    " A social history\n A mental status examination\n An assessment of trauma history\n Intelligence and projective tests review, if necessary\n A behavioral appraisal\n Family, environmental, cultural, and religious or spiritual preference\n Behaviors that necessitated a more restrictive placement setting for the\nchild\n Reviewing previous psychotherapeutic and psychiatric assessments and\ntreatment\n An updated assessment of the child’s specific needs and diagnosis\n Placement recommendations\n Recommended service to meet the child’s identified needs.\nThe daily focus of the residents will center on several different aspects. These\naspects include the developmental needs of children:\n Physical Activity\n Competence and Achievement\n Self-Definition\n Creative Expression\n Positive Social Interaction\n Structure and Clear Limits\n Meaningful Participation\n Strong Attachment with Positive Adults\nGail’s House utilizes the Positive Behavior Support (PBS) system, which has a\nfocus of reinforcing a resident’s positive behaviors. This program also involves\nengaging the resident in numerous on-site and community activities (depending on\nthe age and development abilities of the resident). Activities that are identified are\nthose activities that support the treatment goals and help to build positive skills\nwithin the resident. On-site activities include the “Activity Center”, gym, and\nutilizing outdoor space (walking track or basketball court).\nDirect Care Staff are trained in the Mandt System® utilizing nonphysical and\nphysical techniques in a graded and gradual system from least restrictive to most\nrestrictive. Staff will utilize the least restrictive physical intervention techniques,\nincluding physical restraint, for physical aggression or dangerous behaviors which\nplaces the child and/or others at risk. Staff may not use any physical intervention\ntechniques except for the Mandt System® while working in Program, regardless of\n5",
    "certification. Staff are not allowed to engage in physical intervention if they are not\ncurrently certified in the Mandt System®.\nAt this time, Gail’s House will receive referrals from MDHHS County Office, PAFC\nagency, RPU or 24-Hour Unit.\nThe facility has made changes in their services provided to residents. These\nchanges require the facility to use behavior management techniques to provide a\nsafe environment. Because of this need, the facility was not able to provide the\nsafety necessary under the Therapeutic Child Caring Institution license.\nV. Recommendation\nIt is recommended that a new license be issued to this Child Caring Institution.\nOctober 16, 2019\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nOctober 16, 2019\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
