Additionally, the worker/agency did\nnot ensure he had food.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth A resided in a Holy Cross Independent Living home, but his\nfoster care case management was provided by Bethany Christian\nServices.\nComplainant\nOn 4/28/2025 I spoke with Complainant via a translator,\nInterpreter who spoke Arabic. Complainant reported information,\nas reported by Youth A. It is noteworthy initially it was unclear this\ncomplaint was to be assigned to Bethany but complainant confirm\nthe complaint was against Bethany.\nYouth A\nOn 4/28/2025 I interviewed Youth A via the assistance of\nInterpreter who spoke Arabic. Youth A reported he and other\nyouths were living in an independent living (IL)organization\nthrough Holy Cross and the IL placement only took him one time\nto get food. He said staff at the IL placement verbally threatened\nhim, and other boys, which they had a recording of, but nothing\nphysical happened to him. He said the staff at the IL placement\nwere treating him different than the American youth; and that was\nracism. The example Youth A gave for the different treatment was\nthat once he and boys from other countries cooked food, the Holy\nCross staff threw their food out. Youth A reported Foster Care\nWorker 1 (FCW 1) and Foster Care Supervisor 1(FCS 1) knew\nwhat was going on at the IL placement and they did not do\nanything about their mistreatment. Youth A said they asked FCW\n1 and FCS 1 to go to another home and they said, “no”. He said\nthey ran out of food at the house, and he asked FCW 1 and\n2",
    "Bethany for food, and they did not bring food. He reported he and\nhis friends were out begging for food. He reported FCS 1 told him\nhe had one choice to stay in the placement or Bethany would\npresent the paperwork to court to send him back to his country.\nHe reported he was in that placement two months and nothing\nwas done for him. He said FCW 1, and FCS 2 threatened to send\nhim back to his country when he complained about things.\nOn one hand Youth A reported not getting monies for his needs\nwhile he was in the IL placement and not having food; then on the\nother hand, he admitted to getting a onetime payment of $\n1,600.00 from a special fund, then a $800.00 monthly stipend from\nanother source. He also acknowledged Bethany made\narrangements for him to get those funds. He reported the monies\nhe had to buy his food was not enough and when he would\ncomplain about the way he was threatened with being sent back\nto his country. Youth A did not recall a person/consultant like me\nor any other departmental person investigating concerns of him\nand other boys not having food, being threatened or them not\nreceiving funds for their care while he/they lived in the Holy Cross\nIL placement under Bethany. It is worth noting those allegations\nwere investigated via Special Investigation 2025SIC0000298.\nYouth A reported being in a foster home placement now; and\nhaving a different worker than FCW 1. He reported the $800.00\nmonthly fund now goes to his foster parent instead of him. He\nreported feeling he is also treated differently in the foster home\nthan the other children. The example he gave as proof of the\ndifferent treatment is that the foster father drives the other children\nto school regularly and not him. He denied the foster father\nthreatening him or verbally or physically harming him. He denied\nFCW 1 or FCS1 ever verbally or physically threatening or\nmaltreating him. He reported feeling Foster Care Worker 2 (FCW\n2), who is his current worker, is not listening to him, his concerns\nand has insulted him. He reported two weeks prior to this\ninterview he asked FCW 2 to allow him to go to regular school\ninstead of the adult school he attends, and she indicated he could\nnot. FCW 2 told him he needs to go to this current school and if\nhe continues to complain, Bethany will go back to court and tell\nthe court he is complaining so he is sent back to his country. He\nreported he is not trying to complain; he is trying to be heard. He\nalso reported two weeks ago when he and a friend asked the\nworker to stay and talk, they said he held the worker hostage,\nwould not let her leave. Youth A indicated that was not true and he\nbelieved that is the kind of things the agency uses to threaten him.\n3",
    "Youth A reported he just wants to feel comfortable here, to go to\nthe school he wants, and get medical care, and vaccines.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nOn 4/29/2025 I had email correspondences with CA related to the\ncomplaint. She affirmed Youth A’s placement via Bethany, with\nhim currently being in a treatment foster home. She reported\nbeing aware of the allegations and indicated Youth A has made\ncomplaint multiple times. She reported the complaints have been\ninvestigated and not found to be substantiated. She also reported\nYouth A has called the police, children protective service and the\nFBI multiple times stating these same allegations. CA reported the\nagency has a meeting with Youth A this afternoon to discuss\nconcerns; and the agency has had multiple conversations with\nYouth A in the past about concerns and trying to work through\nthings. CA reported it appears when Youth A does not receive an\nanswer that suits him, including a lack of willingness from the\nfoster parent to purchase him a gym membership, he claims\nracism and other false allegations. CA reported they continue to\ntry to work with him to meet his needs and support the placement.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 (FCS 1)\nOn 4/30/2025, I interviewed FCS 1 by telephone. She reported\nshe was the supervisor assigned to Youth A case prior to him\ngoing to a foster home; and FCW 1 was his assigned worker. She\nexplained when Youth A arrived in Michigan he was placed in a\nfoster home temporally for five days. Thereafter, he went to Holy\nCross’s IL-Plus group home, but she and FCW 1 remained the\nassigned supervisor and worker.\nFCS 1 reported Youth A was always provided his stipend. She\nreported Youth A received a stipend twice monthly. He received\n$825.00 monthly, and it was to pay for rent and pay for groceries.\nShe reported Youth A often refused to engage in services at Holy\nCross’s IL group home, but he always received his stipend. Holy\nCross provided Bethany memo’s showing Youth A received his\nchecks. She reported the name of two Holy Cross staff who could\nverify this. She acknowledged Youth A, Youth B and other boys in\nthe refugee program had often made complaints of not having\nfood. She said there were at least two investigations, by Michigan\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and the\nDivision of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL). She reported the\nboys had called MDHHS and the police at least twice complaining\nof that; but Youth A and the other boys were provided funds to buy\nfood. Bethany also provided the boys with gift cards weekly to\npurchase food, the IL staff took the boys to food pantries twice\n4",
    "weekly; and there were food banks. FCS1 reported Youth A was\nencouraged to spend his stipend in responsible ways, but Youth A\ndid not do that. She said sometimes he would spend all his money\nin a day, buying SIM cards, a television and once a cell phone.\nFCS 1 denied ever telling Youth A to go back to his country; or\nbeing aware of FCW 1 or Holy Cross IL staff doing so. She\nreported not knowing why that would be stated because going\nback to his country is not even an option for him. She reported\nshe and FCW 1 never disrespected Youth A or his culture. She\nreported Youth A, Youth B and a couple of other boys would claim\ndiscrimination or racism if they were told they had to wait for\nthings, like it would take two weeks for their checks to start. She\nreiterated that all the allegations by Youth A were previously\ninvestigated, inclusive of an allegation against an IL staff. She\nreported with regards to the allegation against an IL staff, it was\nalleged by the IL youths that a staff threw away their food, told\nthem they are refugees and did not deserve food, and threatened\nthem while a knife was on the table. FCS 1 reported the boys\nconcern about that matter were not ignored, Bethany contacted\nMDHHS about that matter, it was investigated (2025SIC0000382),\nHoly Cross IL terminated that staff, and Bethany replaced Youth\nA, Youth B and Bethany’s other youths from the IL home based on\nthe allegations.\nFoster Care Worker 1 (FCW 1):\nOn 5/5/2025, I interviewed FCW 1 by telephone. FCW 1 was the\nworker for Youth A from 12/18/2024 until 2/19/2025. She affirmed\ninformation as reported by FCS 1 pertaining to Youth A’s stipend.\nAdditionally, she affirmed how Youth A might have spent his\nfunds, him having a $1600.00 overseas account, and his past\ncomplaints about not having food and funds. She confirmed what\nthe IL home and Bethany did related to ensuring that the youths in\nthe IL home had food. She also reported those complaints were\npreviously investigated by DCWL and MDHHS. FCW 1 denied any\nawareness of Youth A and his friends going out and begging for\nfood. She further reported the IL house staff took the children\ngrocery shopping weekly and there were also food trucks that\nvisited the home. She admitted it initially took until approximately\n1/27/2025 to get Youth A’s stipend open. But even after Youth A\nwas getting his $800.00 monthly stipend, he complained about\nfood. She reported Holy Cross and Bethany provided him and\nother youths gift cards via Walmart and Meijer, etc.\nFCW 1 denied discriminating against Youth A or telling him to go\nback to his country. She reported Youth A was either making this\n5",
    "up or misunderstood something he heard. She reported during a\ntime when speaking on the phone with him, via an interpreter she\nwas explaining to him that he needed to sign his IL contract and\nthat he would need to be in compliance with the contract. She\nreported Youth A was refusing to get a medical and the health\ncare would have been included in his contract. She said during the\ncall she advised Youth A that if he was not incompliance with the\ncontract, he ran the risk of being sent back to his country. She\nnever told him he would be sent back, nor threatened to send him\nback to his country.\nFCW 1 also reported during her contact to the IL house, which\ninitially were weekly then every other week, she never observed\nany discrimination against Youth A, or any of the youths. She said\nYouth A shared the IL home with three other youths from Sudan;\nalong with other youths who were primarily African American. She\nnever observed the other children or the staff mistreating Youth A.\nFCW 1 reported when Youth A was assigned to her, due to it\nbeing around Christmas time, Youth A only attended school a\ncouple of days. He then had to be quarantine; and after he was\nreplaced she was not aware of any concerns he may have with\nschool or concerns related his foster home.\nIndependent Living House Program Manager (ILHPM)\nOn 5/9/2025 I interviewed Holy Cross’ Independent Living House\nProgram Manager (ILHPM) by telephone. ILHPM confirmed\ninformation reported by FCW 1 and FCS 1 pertaining to stipends\nfor Youth A and Youth B. He also affirmed information related\nYouth A, and Youth B running out of food due to them spending all\ntheir money; and what Holy Cross and Bethany did by way of gift\ncards; and food trucks; and that both boys were never without\nfood. He said, the IL home even reached out to an Islamic refugee\noutreach which had Mideastern food, so the boys might have food\nof their culture. He said other boys in the home also shared food\nwith them. He reported both Youth A and Youth B received\nstipend payments of $385 every two weeks; and Holy Cross tried\nto help them set of bank accounts. He said he provided Bethany\nproof of the stipends. He said Bethany also assisted the boys in\nobtaining $600 or more from an initial account that was available\nto the boys so that the boys could purchase things. He reported\nthe boys would complain about different things and even called\nthe FBI on Holy Cross alleging they were not providing them\nservices.\n6",
    "ILHPM reported FCW 1, and FCS 1 made sure Youth A, Youth B\nand the other boys received services, but for some reason the\nboys didn’t fully understand the IL placement. They seemed to\nthink they were in prison. ILHHPM denied ever witnessing FCW 1\nor FCS 1 talking negatively to the boys, calling them out their\nnames nor disrespecting them or behaving in a racist manner\ntowards them.\nFoster Care Worker 2 (FCW 2)\nOn 5/19/2025 I interviewed FCW 2 by telephone. FCW 2 has been\nYouth A’s case worker since 2/19/2025, when he was placed in a\ntreatment foster home. FCW 2 reported Youth A has made\nseveral complaints, and she has met with him to discuss his\ncomplaints. She has talked with him and the foster father on more\nthan one occasion to try to better understand concerns and what\nis going on related to Youth A’s feelings and the complaints. She\naffirmed CA’s reporting of the agency meeting with Youth A on\n4/29/2025. She reported they were aided by an interpreter. Youth\nA was frustrated and continued to claim racism and was unable to\ngive the agency specifics as to what he wants or give legitimate\nexamples of discrimination. She also denied ever telling Youth A\nshe would send him back to his country or to disrespect or\ndiscriminate again him nor had she witnessed any other staff\ndoing such. She said Youth A appears to want to return to Grand\nRapids to be with his friends.\nFCW 2 reported Youth A is placed in a foster home with two other\nyouths and his foster father provides good care to him. She\nreported when Youth A was first placed in the foster home he\ncomplained about his overseas funds. There was about $300.00\nleft in that account, and they helped Youth A access those funds.\nShe was not sure what he spent the funds on. Youth A does not\nget a stipend now, he gets an allowance. She reported she has\nvisited the foster home regularly and there is always food in the\nhome; and Youth A has been provided food of his culture. She\nreported there have been no special evaluation warranted on the\nfoster home. She reported Youth A attends an adult education\nschool program. She helped him get into that educational setting\nafter he was in a regular school and complained about wanting to\ngo at a faster pace, so as to graduate sooner. He is doing well in\nthe program; has a tutor and is not struggling. FCW 2 reported\nshe and the foster father have also explained to Youth A why the\nother foster children received a ride to school, their schools being\nmiles away and his three minutes away, which he rides his bike to\nby his choice. The foster father originally gave all of the children\nrides, due to the weather, but now that the weather is warmer,\n7",
    "Youth A can ride his bike. FCW 2 reported Youth A struggles in\nhis placement and that may be tied to culture and emotional\nadjustment issues. The agency has pursued mental health service\nfor him; and they hope with therapy and other supportive\nmeasures Youth A will feel more comfortable and supported.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 (FCS 2)\nOn 5/19/2025 I interview FCW 2 by telephone related to the\nallegations. She denied the allegations and affirmed base\ninformation as reported by FCW 2. She had no knowledge of\nanyone telling Youth A to go back to his country.\nShe also reported the agency assisted Youth A in getting the\nbalance of about $600 from a refugee account that gets\nestablished for youths like him when they enter the county. She\nreported Youth A does still receive monies. He receives an\nallowance as given by the foster parent. She added that when\nshe has meet with Youth A, he has reported wanting another\nperson to have his case due racism, but he has been unable to\ngive examples of the racism. She reported Youth A knows she is\nthe supervisor; and he has never reported FCW 2, or the foster\nparent calling him out his name or disrespecting him in some\nmanner.\nYouth B\nOn 5/30/2025 I interviewed Youth B by telephone with the aid of\nInterpreter. Youth B reported being in the Holy Cross IL placement\nwith Youth A. He reported in that placement it was never about a\nlack of food, (but the kitchen did close at 9:00pm); or him and\nYouth A and other youths not knowing the rules. It was about the\nmistreatment and “no respect”. He described the mistreatment\nand no respect being that they were placed in a bad placement at\nHoly Cross; and then moved to another bad placement. He\nreported the placement was bad because he was not given his\nmoney and when he complained they threatened to kick him out\nthe house. He reported FCS 2 threatened to kick him out the IL\nhouse and then moved him. Youth B could not recall whether a\nperson like me had investigated his concerns in the past.\nYouth B denied FCW 1 or FCW 2 verbally or physically harming\nhim, cursing or calling him out his name nor had he witnessed or\nheard FCW 1 or FCS 1 doing such to Youth A or other youths.\nNotwithstanding this, Youth B continued stating he needs help\ngetting what he wants, which he reported is to move to a better\nplacement.\n8",
    "Documents Reviewed:\nYouth A MISACWIS record which showed:\n• Youth A was an unaccompanied refugee from Sudan and\narrived in the United States on 12/18/2024 where he was\nplacement in a foster home until 12/23/2024.\n• On 12/23/2024 he was placed in a Holy Cross’s\nIndependent Living-plus group home under Bethany\nRefugee program’s supervision.\n• Youth A is a temporary court ward.\n• He was placed in his current foster home placement on\n2/19/2025.\n• He had a medical and dental examination on 1/30/2025.\n• Service plans which showed Youth A’s medical and\nimmunization to be up to date; he had been taken for food,\nclothing, medical care, and financial services were\ncompleted for him.\nSpecial Investigation 2025SIC0000298, which showed:\n• Youth B was the primary youth the allegations related to;\nand all youths in the IL home, including Youth A, were\ninterviewed.\n• The allegations were that FCW 1 was not providing the\nyouth with entitled funding, placed the youth in a shelter\nand told him if he did not like it he can go back to his\ncountry.\n• Youth A during his interview reported he had not received\na last month’s check but understood the program was\nworking on getting the rest of the money.
