She reported the agency currently\nhas 8 boxes full of closed adoption files that were prepared prior to the 2020 stay-at-\nhome order was issued that have not yet been distributed.

    "APPLICABLE RULE\nADM 1030 Disposition of Records for MDHHS Supervised Children\nFor both MDHHS and contracted adoption agency cases, the\nlocal MDHHS office or contracted agency must retain all\nadoption case records for one year after finalization of the\nadoption. One year (between 12-13 months) past the adoption\nfinalization date, a contracted adoption agency must send the\noriginal record to the local MDHHS office; copies must not be\nmaintained by the contracted adoption agency; see licensing\nrule R400.12713-Adoption Placement Record.\nANALYSIS: A violation has been established due to the agency identifying\n33 files that have not been sent to the local MDHHS office within\nthe required timeframe.\nConsultation\nI suggested Chief Administrator reach out directly to DHHS\ndirectors and if she continues to not receive timely or adequate\nresponses, reach out to the applicable BSC Director for\nassistance.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change to the license status.\nJune 27, 2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 29, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
