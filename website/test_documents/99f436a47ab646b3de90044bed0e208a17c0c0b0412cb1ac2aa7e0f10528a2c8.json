She stated that there was never a\nconversation with Therapist that involved any inappropriate topics.\nYouth A stated that she spoke with Therapist within the past week\nabout how he was going to be out on a leave and might miss\nsome sessions with her, but there were no specifics about why he\nwas going to be on a leave that were shared. Youth A stated that\nStaff 1 was recently in a session with her and Therapist but was\nnot sure if that involved a quick conversation about the therapist\nbeing out on a leave. Youth A stated that there has never been a\ntime when Therapist shared any inappropriate information about\nhimself to her, nor was she aware of any details as to why he was\nout on a medical leave. She stated she felt safe with him and that\nhe was helpful to her in his capacity.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 12/05/2023. She\nstated that she has spent a considerable amount of time with\nYouth A as a 1:1 staff. Staff 1 stated that she was sitting in for\npart of a session recently between Youth A and Therapist on the\nday before the Labor Day holiday. Staff 1 recalled that Therapist\ntold Youth A that he was going to miss their next session together\nbecause he was going on a leave for a medical procedure.

    "spent a considerable amount of time working with Youth A and\nYouth A is often inappropriate with other youth and staff.\nTherapist was interviewed over video on 12/13/2023. He stated\nthat he has recently returned from a brief medical leave and that\nhe is no longer assigned to work with Youth A. Therapist recalled\na conversation with Youth A the day prior to his medical leave\nbeginning. He stated Staff 1 was in the room with him and Youth\nA because she was acting as the 1:1 staff with Youth A. Therapist\nrecalled intentionally telling Youth A that he was going to miss a\nsession with her because she has struggled in the past with\nunpredictability. Therapist stated that he did not give Youth A any\ndetails on why he was having a procedure. He recalled that Youth\nA asked him if he was “having a vagina implanted.” Therapist\nstated back to Youth A that was not the case. He also recalled\ntelling her that the procedure was a sensitive topic and it did not\nneed to be discussed. Therapist believed that Youth A also asked\nhim something about the procedure having to do with STDs.\nTherapist recalled that he may have said something to Youth A\nabout having discomfort or pain and that being a reason for\nneeding medical attention, but no other details were disclosed to\nYouth A. He did not believe he made reference to where a\nprocedure was occurring on his body. Therapist denied making\nany reference or motion to his crotch in this conversation with\nYouth A. Therapist recalled being able to redirect the\nconversation. Therapist was not sure if he documented their\nconversation. He stated that he has witnessed Youth A be\ninappropriate with other youth and staff on many occasions, and\nthat is a component of her treatment needs.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• No discipline noted in the personnel file for Therapist.\n• “Chart Notes” documentation for Youth A on 11/09/2023\nwas reviewed. Entries for that date regarding interactions\nwith Youth A were entered by Staff 1 and the Therapist but\nno mention was made of the alleged conversation between\nYouth A and Therapist.\n• Facility policy titled “Employee - Resident Relationships”\ndated 05/18/2022 was reviewed. This policy stated “Staff\nmembers are expected to refrain from sharing details of\ntheir personal lives with residents.”\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed, sufficient evidence was not found that a rule violation\noccurred in the interaction between Youth A and Therapist on\n11/09/2023.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
