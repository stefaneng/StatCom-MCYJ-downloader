Compliance\n06/23/2022 Contact pre-exit with Chief Administrator\nALLEGATION:\nFacility has not submitted records to MDHHS for permanent retention one year\nfollowing the final order of adoption as required. There are 2 records that have not\nbeen submitted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/23/22 it was reported to DCWL that DHHS had not received two closed\nadoption files that were due in 2021. Contact occurred with the complainant to\ndetermine the names on the overdue files.\nChief Administrator\nOn 5/24/22 Chief Administrator (CA) was contacted and informed of the allegation.\nOn 5/30/22 a site visit occurred at the agency and CA was interviewed. CA reported\nmaintaining a spreadsheet of finalized adoptions with due dates for the file to be sent\nto DHHS. CA reported she did not previously have DHHS sign when accepting the\nfile. However, they plan to implement this practice going forward. CA reported that\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic local DHHS offices were refusing to accept case\nfiles, as staff were not working in the office. Therefore, the agency held on to several\nfiles from 2019-2022.\nCA provided the following information for the identified files:\n2",
    " File one: The file was due to DHHS by November 2021. However, it was not\non the spreadsheet and therefore sent late. The file was sent to DHHS on\n4/27/22.\n File two: The file was due to DHHS by December 2021. However, it was not\nsent on time, as the agency planned to send it when the sibling’s adoptions\nwere completed. Unfortunately, those adoptions took longer than expected.\nThe file was sent to DHHS on 5/19/22.\nOn 6/8/22 CA provided a list of all adoption files due from 2020 to 2022. There were\nten files currently overdue. There were forty-two files that were sent late. In addition,\nfrom 2017-2019, seven files were sent to DHHS late and eighteen files were\noverdue but had not been sent yet.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nADM 1030 Disposition of Records for MDHHS- Supervised Children\nFor both MDHHS and contracted adoption agency cases, the\nlocal MDHHS office or contracted agency must retain all\nadoption case records for one year after finalization of the\nadoption. One year (between 12-13 months) past the adoption\nfinalization date, a contracted adoption agency must send the\noriginal record to the local MDHHS office; copies must not be\nmaintained by the contracted adoption agency; see licensing\nrule R400.12713-Adoption Placement Record.\nANALYSIS: A violation was found due to multiple adoption files that were\nlate or remain overdue to DHHS.\nTechnical Assistance\nIt was discussed with the CA there was some confusion about\nfile retention dates and inclusion of the foster care file, when\nsending the adoption file to DHHS. Technical Assistance was\nprovided regarding FOM 722-15 as it conflicts with Rule 422(4)\nregarding file retention. DCWL confirmed that FOM 722-15 must\nbe followed.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",
