She reported finding out about the allegations\nyesterday during a visit Youth A had with Youth A’s mother. Youth\nA informed Foster Care Worker 1 Youth A was informed by staff\nthat “staff don’t lie for staff”. Youth A didn’t disclose the full story of\nthe accident but indicated it occurred after Youth A’s visit to Youth\nA’s grandmother’s home. Foster Care Worker 1 also received an\n2",
    "email (reviewed below) from the facility about the accident on\n4/7/2024.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n4/24/2024. She reported knowing of the incident involving the\naccident but was not present the day it occurred.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n4/24/2024 and interviewed face to face at school on 4/26/2024\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth A reported being in\nthe van on 4/7/24 when Staff 4 flipped the van in a parking lot. He\nreported Staff 4 was doing “donuts” and when the back wheel,\ntires locked, and the van flipped landing on the passenger side.\nYouth A reported asking Staff 4 to do donuts and Youth B, Youth\nC, Youth D, and Youth E agreed with Staff 4 doing donuts. Staff 5\nand Staff 6 said nothing when Youth A asked Staff 4 to do donuts\nand began to drive in this manner. Youth A reported Staff 4 was\n“drifting” the van just before hitting the turn and flipping the van.\nYouth A reported Staff 4 told Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D,\nand Youth E to tell the police and others that Staff 4 was just\ntrying to turn, and the van flipped.

Youth B reported being in\nthe van driven by Staff 4 when the van flipped onto its passenger\nside. Youth B reported the accident took place in the parking lot of\na local park. Youth B believed because of the number of\nindividuals (Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, Youth E, Staff 4,\nStaff 5, and Staff 6) in the van and when Staff 4 turned into the\nparking lot, the shift in weight caused the van to flip. The flip\noccurred because of the weight causing the van to “pop-up” and\nlocked the wheels. Youth B reported the tipping over was slow.\nYouth B reported a belief that the van had mechanical issues and\nneeded maintenance as reasons that contributed to the flipping.\nYouth B reported never observing Staff 4 drive reckless when\nYouth B has been a passenger with Staff 4 driving. Staff 4 nor\nanyone else told Youth B what to say or not say about the\naccident. Youth B reported Staff 4 is his “primary” staff and they\nhave a good relationship with Youth B liking Staff 4 a great deal.\nYouth B feels safe at the facility.\n3",
    "Youth D was interviewed face to face at school on 4/26/2024\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth D reported being in\nthe van driven by Staff 4 on 4/7/24 when the van flipped on the\npassenger side. Youth D reported Staff 4 was “doing donuts and\ndrifting” with the van prior to the van flipping. This occurred in a\nlocal park and Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, Youth E, Staff\n5, and Staff 6 were also in the van at the time. Youth D\nremembered Staff 4 said he was going to do donuts and drift but\ncould not remember Staff 5 and Staff 6’s response to Staff 4 but is\nsure they did say something. Youth D reported Staff 4 had done\n“drifting” in the past (unable to recall specifics) but didn’t flip the\nvan when doing so. Youth D reported Staff 5 and Staff 6 told\nYouth D to tell the truth about the accident and no one told Youth\nD not to tell the truth. Youth D reported feeling safe at the facility.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face to face at the main campus on\n5/8/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nunderstanding the reason for this interview and was present in the\nvan during the incident. He reported the trip in the van began at\nmain campus and the group (Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D,\nYouth E, Staff 4, Staff 6, and Staff 5) were headed back to the\nfacility. Staff 4 was driving and as he drew close to the facility,\nStaff 4 turned into a small park at a high rate of speed, and\nsomeone (unidentified) said “buckle up because here we go”. Staff\n6 reported being hired at the facility approximately a month and a\nhalf ago and that this was the first-time riding in the van with Staff\n4 driving. Staff 6 had the impression that this has occurred before\nbecause of the reaction of Staff 4 and Youth A, Youth B, Youth C,\nYouth D, and Youth E in the van. Staff 4 drove onto the grass and\ndid a couple of donuts before driving to the pavement and doing\nthree donuts. Staff 6 described the situation as like a “monster\ntruck on the grass and a Dodge Charger on the pavement”. Staff 6\nreported sitting in the last seat against the window and when Staff\n4 turned the van in the opposite direction to begin another donut,\nthe van flipped onto its passenger side. Staff 6 reported yelling at\nStaff 4 to stop throughout the incident but believed the youth\n“yelling to go” kept Staff 4 engaged in the reckless driving. Staff 6\nbelieved they were going approximately 65 to 70 miles per hour at\ntimes. Staff 6 reported not knowing if the youth were buckled in\nwith seat belts and believds only Youth B may have been using a\nseat belt. Since Staff 6 just began his employment, he reported\nbeing unsure of the seat belt rules. Staff 6 reported Staff 5 didn’t\nsay anything to Staff 4 during the reckless driving and appeared to\nbe “holding on for dear life”. Staff 6 reported Staff 4 had asked the\nyouth in the van (Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, and Youth\nE) if they saw Staff 4’s moves while driving. Staff 6 reported\n4",
    "hurting his shoulder in the accident and when at the hospital, Staff\n4 confronted Staff 6 and was mad that Staff 6 would tell the truth\nabout the cause of the accident. Staff 6 reported Staff 4 called\nStaff 6 a “snitch and to get the fuck out of his face”. Staff 4\ninformed Staff 6 that Staff 6 will see what can happen to Staff 6\nafter work because Staff 6 will never see it coming. Staff 6 was\nunable to identify which youth were hurt. Staff 6 reported avoiding\ncontact with Staff 4 once back at the facility but did report some of\nthe youth (unable to identify) told him Staff 4 had asked them to lie\nabout the cause of the accident.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the main campus on\n5/8/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nbeing in the van during the incident and reported they were\nheading to the facility from the main campus. Youth A had asked\nStaff 4 to “spin the van” on the way so Staff 4 pulled into the\n“Broom Park”. Staff 5 reported Staff 4 was driving approximately\n50 to 60 miles per hour when pulling into the park and started\ndoing donuts on the pavement. Staff 4 then did donuts in the\ngrass before driving back on the pavement and doing more\ndonuts. Staff 5 believed Staff 4 did 4 or 5 more donuts on the\npavement before the van flipped on the passenger side. Staff 5\nreported sitting on the passenger side just behind the passenger\nseat at the time. Staff 5 reported being upset over Staff 4’s driving\nbut not saying anything to Staff 4 about the reckless driving. Staff\n5 reported having regrets over not speaking up. Staff 5 reported\nnever observing Staff 4 drive reckless before but believed it has\noccurred before because Youth A told Staff 4 to spin the van and\nStaff 4 appeared to understand what Youth A was saying. Staff 5\nwas unsure if all of the youth (Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth\nD, and Youth E) were wearing seatbelts but was sure Youth A\nwas because Youth A was sitting next to Staff 5. Staff 5 reported\nStaff 4 didn’t ask Staff 5 to lie about the accident and Staff 5 never\nspoke to Staff 4 following the accident. Staff 5 was unaware of\nwhat Staff 4 told Law Enforcement after the accident or what Staff\n4 said to the youth (Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, and\nYouth E) following the accident. Staff 5 reported Staff 4 did take\nresponsibility for the accident and called management and told\nmanagement there was an accident.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the school on\n5/8/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth C\nreported blacking out during the accident with the van flipping. He\nreported sitting in the third row behind the driver’s seat. Youth C\nreported Youth A, Youth B, and Youth E all asked Staff 4 to do\ndonuts after they entered the park near the facility. Staff 5 and\n5",
    "Staff 6 didn’t say anything to Staff 4 about stopping the van and\ndonuts. Youth C was unable to identify if Staff 4 said anything\nbecause Staff 4 was playing the music loud at the time. Youth C\nreported believing Staff 4 did approximately 5 donuts in the\nparking lot with some of the donuts on the grass and others on the\npavement. Youth C reported the van flipped on its passenger side\nand he was unsure who was cut by glass but believes someone\nwas. Youth C reported Staff 4 has done donuts when Youth C\nwas in the van in the past. He reported Staff 4 would cut corners\nfast and drifting at times when driving. Youth C was unable to\nrecall who the other youth in the van was at the time this occurred.\nA second time Staff 4 was driving like this occurred in the same\npark when Staff 4 did 6 donuts after picking up Youth C from\nschool. Youth C reported Youth A, Youth B, Youth E, and Staff 9\nalong with a youth, Youth C could not name. Youth C reported\nhaving his seatbelt on, but the other youth (Youth A, Youth B, and\nYouth E) did not have their seatbelts on. Youth C denied Staff 4\nthreaten youth to tell a false story. Youth C reported feeling safe at\nthe facility.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face in the parking lot of a\ngrocery story on 5/8/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS\nworker. Staff 4 denied the allegations of doing donuts, and drifting\nthe van with youth (Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, and\nYouth E) and staff (Staff 5 and Staff 6) in the van. He reported\ndriving a “little fast” but not “speeding much”. He denied driving on\nthe grass and when trying to make a left turn in a narrow part of\nthe pavement, the back wheel “locked” and the van tilted causing\nthe accident. He denied making the skid marks in the parking lot\nbecause they were too small to have been made by the van. Staff\n4 admitted to doing “circles” in the parking lot but not “donuts”.\nStaff 4 reported only going about 15-miles per hour when doing\n“circles” and engaged in this activity to “waste” time before\nreturning to the facility. Staff 4 reported a belief that because of\nthe number of passengers in the van this contributed to the van\ntipping over. Staff 4 reported all of the passengers in the van had\ntheir seatbelts on as required. He reported not threatening or\ntelling the youth what to say when asked by Law Enforcement and\nsuggested he was threatened by Staff 6.\nYouth E was interviewed via phone on 5/10/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker.

He reported being in the facility for\napproximately a year and left a day after the accident. He gave\nthe same information of who was in the van and seating location\n6",
    "as others interviewed. He reported wearing a seatbelt during the\nride but was unsure if other youth (Youth A, Youth B, Youth C,\nand Youth D) were wearing their seatbelts. Youth E reported Staff\n4 turned real fast and this caused the back wheel to lock and\nwhen Staff 4 tried to make the wheel unlock it caused the van to\ntip over. Youth E denied Staff 4 was doing any donuts nor driving\nfast in the park. Youth E reported not paying attention to what was\ngoing on, so he didn’t hear any other youth (Youth A, Youth B,\nYouth C, and Youth D) ask Staff 4 to do donuts. Youth E recalled\nStaff 4 said something after the accident but was unable to recall\nwhat was said. Youth E ended by saying he was not paying\nattention to what anyone else was doing so he didn’t know if Staff\n4 was doing donuts or not.\nStaff 9 was interviewed via phone on 5/16/2024 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported not being\npresent at the time of the accident. He reported never witnessing\nStaff 4 doing donuts when they both worked at the facility.
