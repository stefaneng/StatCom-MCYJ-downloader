    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth J was kissed and touched by a peer implying inadequate\nstaff supervision.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Complainant by phone on 4/2/24.\nI notified Youth J’s Foster Care Worker of the assigned\ninvestigation. She had no licensing concerns pertaining to Vista\nMaria.\nI interviewed Youth J on 4/3/24 with Rights Officer present. She\nhas been at Vista Maria for four months. Youth J said Youth D\nhas touched her thighs under the table in the conference room\nattached to A-wing on an unknown date. She said Staff 1 was\nsupervising but could not see under the table. Youth J said Youth\nD also touched her “boobs” several times on the couch in the\ngeneral living area. Various staff were always supervising on\ndifferent unknown dates and times when this occurred. Youth J\nsaid, “Youth D was sneaky” and that she would cover up with a\njacket so the activity could not be detected.\nMore recently Youth J said she and Youth D planned to meet\ninside the wing bathroom. “I suggested the bathroom where\nthere’s no cameras,” she announced. “I was in the first stall and\nYouth D came in. We kissed. She tried to give me a hickey on\nmy boob. It’s not there anymore.” Apparently, Youth J informed\nsomeone that this happened, and Youth J was transferred to a\ndifferent wing on 3/25/24.\nI interviewed Youth D on 4/3/24 with Rights Officer present. She\nsaid she has been at the facility for two months. Youth D said\nYouth J “grabbed my hand and made me touch her thigh” under\n2",
    "the table in the conference room where staff can’t see.” Youth D\nsaid staff were in the room supervising but she was unsure which\nstaff it was. Asked if she touched Youth J inappropriately on the\ncouch in the general area, Youth J insisted, “No. No. No.” In\nterms of the girls kissing in the bathroom, Youth D said Youth J\n“set that up. She put the shower on and then went into the first\nstall. I went in behind her. She wanted to kiss me. I didn’t want to\nkiss her or meet her in the bathroom. I was forced.” Youth D said\nStaff 2 was supervising the girls outside the bathroom. Staff 2 let\nYouth D use the bathroom because she thought Youth J was in\nthe shower. “We are on a separation plan.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 via Teams on 4/10/24 with Rights Officer\npresent. She has worked at the facility part-time for two years.\nStaff 1 stated she sometimes monitors youth at a table in the\nconference room, but never saw or heard that Youth J or Youth D\ntouched each other’s legs under the table. If youths sit too close\nto one another, she said she asks them to move further away and\nthe same goes for when they are sitting on the couch. Staff 1 did\nnot monitor the youths in the bathroom, but explained two youths\nare allowed to be in there together if they use two different stalls\nor one is in the toilet and the other in the shower stall.\nI interviewed Staff 2 via phone on 4/10/24 with Rights Officer\npresent. She has worked at the facility for seven months. Staff 2\ndenied seeing or suspecting Youth J and Youth D ever touched or\nkissed. She recalled the day the two youths asked to use the\nbathroom. Youth J was in the bathroom and Staff 2 called out to\nher asking if she was in the shower. Youth J responded, “Yes.”\nAfter that Youth D asked to use the toilet and went into a toilet\nstall while Staff 2 stood at the doorway of the bathroom. Staff 2\nsaid she stood there until Youth D exited the bathroom. A few\ndays later “Youth J told me she had lied to me about something in\nthe bathroom, but she would not say what she lied about.”\nAfterward this Youth J was moved to a different wing.\nDocument reviewed:\nBack to Basics – Guidelines, Expectations and Campus-Wide\nRules for Vista Maria Unit Staff which indicates staff must maintain\na position inside the bathroom if two or more clients are present.\nAnalysis Both girls admitted they touched under a table and planned to\nmeet in the bathroom and kiss. Both girls claimed the other forced\nthem to touch and kiss. The youths said a thigh was touched\nunder a table where staff could not see their hands. In the\nbathroom, one turned on the shower pretending to shower, but\n3",
    "she was actually in a toilet stall. The other youth went inside the\nsame toilet stall and the youths kissed. Staff 2 was supervising at\nthe doorway of the bathroom, but Vista Maria’s guideline indicates\nstaff must position themself inside the bathroom if two or more\nclients are present. Staff 2 did not follow the written guideline.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nApril 20, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 29, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n4"

    "summary": "The investigation substantiated that inappropriate physical contact, including kissing and touching, occurred between two residents, Youth J and Youth D, at the Vista Maria facility. The incidents happened due to lapses in supervision, including staff not being able to see under a table and, critically, a staff member (Staff 2) failing to follow the facility's own written policy by not positioning herself inside the bathroom while two residents were present. The facility is ultimately culpable for the violation due to its staff's failure to adhere to established supervision protocols.",
