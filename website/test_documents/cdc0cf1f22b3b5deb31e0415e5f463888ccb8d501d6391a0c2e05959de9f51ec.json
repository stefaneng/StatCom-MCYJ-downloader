They reported being aware of the allegations because the\nfacility called in the report to DHHS. The facility is conducting their\nown investigation and have suspended Staff 1, Staff 2, and\nSupervisor 2 who were involved in the restraint and Supervisor 3\nand Nurse Manager who were observing the restraint of Youth A.\nThey also reported being informed of the incident right after it\noccurred, and it was then they suspended the staff mentioned\nabove. Supervisor 3 and Nurse Manager were suspended\nbecause they observed the inappropriate restrain and failed to\nstop it or report it. They also reported Nurse Manager had\nresigned her position right after being questioned about the\nrestraint.\nYouth A was observed face to face at the facility on 7/27/23 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He showed bruising on his\nupper left arm and wrist area. He reported feeling “alright” at this\ntime and that he was upset prior to the restraint because his\nmother left him.\nDHHS Case Manager was interviewed via phone on 7/28/23.\nShe reported having a face-to-face contact with Youth A earlier in\nthe day and had no concerns at this time. She also reported\nhaving no concerns with the services being provided by the\nfacility. She reported Youth A is struggling to make progress for\nhis “sexual reactiveness” and will likely move to an adult mental\nhealth facility in the future.\n2",
    "Supervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/2/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nwalking into the hallway and once observing the restraint, telling\nStaff 1, Staff 2, and Supervisor 2 to release their hold on Youth A.\nShe did this because they were holding him in a prone position\nwhich is not allowed. Staff 1, Staff 2, and Supervisor 2 all released\nYouth A in seconds after she told them to release. Nurse Manager\nwas present, and Supervisor 3 was pacing the hallway when\nSupervisor 1 entered the hallway. She reported saying to Staff 1,\nStaff 2, and Supervisor 2 who were holding Youth A, “what the hell\nare you doing, turn him over”. She was unsure who told her the\nstaff had to put him into this hold because Youth A was trying to\nstab staff and “they had no choice”. Once released, Youth A sat\nup and leaned against the wall while crying. Supervisor 1 did not\nsee any pencil nor any injuries on Youth A. Staff 1, Staff 2, and\nSupervisor 2 all told her Youth A was in the restraint for 20 to 21\nminutes. Immediately after administrating the medication to Youth\nA and leaving the area, Supervisor 1 called “Risk Management”\nand the Chief Operating Officer about the inappropriate restraint.\nSupervisor 1 also reported all staff have yearly refresher training\non restraints and they are told to never use the prone position.\nComplainant was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/2/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nhaving no firsthand information about the incident. She is in\ncharge of Recipient Rights at the facility and was informed of the\nrestraint by Administrator 2 who informed her he received the\ninformation from Supervisor 1 the day of the incident. She\nreviewed the video recording of the incident and identified Staff 1\nholding Youth A’s left arm and side, while Staff 2 held Youth A’s\nright arm and side. Supervisor 2 held Youth A's legs during the\nprone restraint with Nurse Manager holding Youth A’s legs for a\ncouple of minutes. Supervisor 3 called for medication and\nClinician came to the scene and appeared to speak to Youth A for\nabout 10 minutes before leaving. Complainant also reported the\nincident began when Youth A pushed himself off the wall and\nattempted to kick Staff 1. Staff 1 grabbed Youth A’s leg and Youth\nA fell to the ground in a prone position. When Youth A was on the\nfloor, Staff 1, Staff 2, and Supervisor 2 began the restraint.\nComplainant reported when interviewing Staff 1, Staff 2,\nSupervisor 2, Nurse Manager, and Supervisor 3, they all admitted\nto knowing Youth A should not have been in a prone position for\nthe restraint. All of these staff are trained in appropriate restraints.\nStaff 1 was the supervisor on the floor and “made the call” for the\nrestraint to begin. Complainant also reported it was mentioned\nthat Staff 2 said during the restraint, “Youth A should not be on his\n3",
    "stomach”. She was unable to recall which staff reported this\ninformation. Staff 1 was resistant to moving Youth A from the\nprone position because he believed it was more dangerous to\nmove him given his aggression earlier. Complainant also reported\nYouth A appeared calm throughout most of the restraint.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed again face to face at the\nfacility on 8/2/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He\nreported being informed of the inappropriate restraint on the day it\noccurred (7/25/23) and after talking with Supervisor 1 and\nwatching the video recording, contacting Complainant and\nAdministrator 2. Both Administrator 2 and Complainant began\ninterviews with staff and Youth A on 7/26/23 and having\nComplainant report the incident to DHHS on the morning of\n7/27/23.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/2/23 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported being in the role\nof a residential staff at the time of the incident and that he will\nwork as a supervisor at times during other shifts. He reported\nnoticing Youth A was having some difficulty early in the morning\nand at one point had barricaded himself in the bathroom. After\nbeing asked to assist with Youth A’s hygiene, Staff 1 went to\nassist and found Youth A with a pencil making stabbing motions\ntowards Staff 2. Staff 1 circled behind Youth A and was able to\ngrab the pencil from him from behind. Youth A then grabbed an\neraser, throwing it at Staff 1 before punching Staff 1 a couple of\ntimes. As Staff 1 turned and walked away from Youth A, Youth A\nattempted to kick Staff 1. Staff 1 was able to grab Youth A’s leg\nand when letting go, Youth A fell to the ground in a prone position.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was laying on the ground making hissing\nsounds noting he “makes this type of noise when being\naggressive” and no one was touching him. Staff 1 believed Youth\nA was getting ready to become more aggressive as his “hissing\nwas increasing, and this generally means he is becoming more\nrageful”. Staff 1 secured Youth A’s left arm while Staff 2 secured\nYouth A’s right arm. After Youth A kicked Staff 1 with his knee in\nStaff 1’s side, Supervisor 2 became involved and held Youth A’s\nlegs. Staff 1 reported beginning the restraint because he believed\nYouth A was going to get up and “go after someone else”. Youth A\nkept trying to get up while Staff 1 was trying to keep him calm.\nStaff 1 also reported Youth A was “thrashing around and trying to\npull his arms free”. Every time, Staff 1 attempted to let go of Youth\nA, Youth A would keep fighting and saying he wanted to hurt staff.\nStaff 1 also believed Youth A had a belief that if he got hurt his\nfather would come to the facility and take him home and Youth A\n4",
    "will act out aggressively to “release the fire inside of him”. Staff 1\nbased these beliefs on past statements Youth A has made to staff.\nStaff 1 also reported they were unable to move Youth A into\nanother position because he would kick staff, and someone would\nget hurt. Staff 1 reported there was no safe way to release Youth\nA because he would have been a danger to himself and others.\nStaff 1 had this belief because Youth A was attempting to bite staff\nduring the restraint. Staff 1 reported when Supervisor 1 came on\nthe scene, she told staff she could not give medication to a youth\nin the prone position. When Supervisor 1 came on the scene,\nYouth A stopped struggling and was allowed to sit up. Once up,\nStaff 1 also reported Youth A went to the backdoor and kicked it\nopen. Staff 1 doesn’t’ recall anyone saying Youth A should be let\nup because they were so focused on keeping Youth A in control.\nStaff 1 reported the facility used to use the prone position and they\nare now trained not to use the prone position but sometimes, “the\nyouth just get into that position”. Staff 1 believed they needed\nmore help and sometimes as in this situation, there just isn’t\nenough help.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/2/23 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported prior to the\nrestraint, Youth A got into an argument with a peer twice before\nbarricading himself in the bathroom. Once leaving the bathroom\nhe started kicking doors while yelling and screaming. Staff 2\nstayed in the hallway with him until Supervisor 3 came into the\nhall. Youth A then pulled out a pencil and started punching Staff 1\nin the chest. Youth A also kicked at Staff 1’s legs before he began\nto act like he was stabbing someone. Staff 2 gave the same report\nabout the beginning of the restraint when Youth A pushed off the\nwall and attempted to kick Staff 1. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 said\n“let’s restrain Youth A” while Youth A was in the prone position on\nthe floor. Staff 2 believed Youth A was in “attack mode” because\nhe was struggling. Staff 1 started the restraint and Staff 2 joined\nby grabbing Youth A’s right arm. Staff 2 asked Staff 1 “are you\nsure we are doing this” and was told yes because the nurse is not\nthere yet and there is not a lot of staff present. Youth A is also on\nsuicide precautions which requires more supervision. Staff 2\nreported he was questioning the quickness of the restraint\nbecause “staff should never put a youth in a prone restraint”. Staff\n2 also reported Supervisor 1 came on the scene and told staff\nYouth A cannot be in a prone position, so Staff 2 helped get Youth\nA up to a sitting position. Youth A was still upset when released\nbut he sat on the floor leaning against the wall. Staff 2 shared the\nbelief the facility doesn’t teach staff never to put a youth in the\n5",
    "prone position. He reported staff are taught to not move a youth\nduring a restraint because of safety issues.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/2/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She gave a similar\nreport about the beginning of the incident as Staff 2. She reported\nYouth A wanted a break from school before leaving and returning\nto the classroom. Youth A left the classroom again and barricaded\nhimself in the bathroom. After Youth A came out of the bathroom,\nhe began to walk up the hallway with Staff 1, Staff 2, and\nSupervisor 2. Youth A had his fists clinched before he “took a\nswing at Staff 1. She overheard Staff 1 ask Youth A what was in\nhis hand and when looking she noticed the pencil. Youth A\nbecame aggressive by swing and kicking at staff and when trying\nto kick at Staff 1, Staff 1 grabbed his foot and Youth A ended up\non the floor in a prone position. Supervisor 2 recalled Staff 1\nasked Staff 2 to grab Youth A’s right arm and Staff 2 responded\nwith “are we really going to do this”. Staff 1 asked Supervisor 2 to\nput hands on Youth A’s legs and she was able to “cuff” his legs,\nso his legs were not touching the ground. Supervisor 2 reported\nafter Staff 1 called for the restraint, Youth A began to attempt to\nbite staff. Prior to her grabbing Youth A’s legs and prior to the\nrestraint, while Youth A was laying in the prone position, he was\nnot kicking but once the restraint began Youth A started “horse\nkicking”. Supervisor 3 left the area at the beginning of the restraint\nto call for a nurse. Supervisor 2 acknowledged staff are not to use\na prone position in a restraint because this rule changed a few\nyears ago but she was unsure if they are trained not to use a\nprone restraint. She believed Youth A should have been released\neven if he was still a danger to himself or others but never said\nanything about it. Supervisor 2 reported until Supervisor 1 said\nsomething none of the other staff said anything about their action\nbeing an inappropriate restraint. Even when Clinician came on the\nscene and spoke with Youth A, she said nothing about the\nrestraint position. Supervisor 2 also reported after the restraint,\nStaff 1 told her he was “sorry to have called the restraint”.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/2/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported being\npresent during the incident involving the prone restraint of Youth\nA. She was in the office area with Supervisor 2 when Staff 2\nbrought Youth A to the office indicating Youth A needed a break.\nYouth A kept wandering off even though Supervisor 2 provided\nredirection. Supervisor 2 took Youth A back to the classroom while\nSupervisor 3 remained at the desk. When looking down the hall\nshe noticed Staff 2 was alone with Youth A, so she went down the\n6",
    "hall to provide support if needed. Youth A was kicking doors and\nboth Staff 2 and Supervisor 3 attempted to help him calm down.\nAs Supervisor 3 was moving a desk out of the way, Youth A\napproached her and “tried to push through the door” behind her.\nShe noticed a pencil in his hand and told him to give it up, but he\njust walked down the hall. Down the hall, Supervisor 2 and Staff 1\ncame on scene and Youth A tried to stab Staff 1 with the pencil.\nStaff 1 grabbed the pencil and Youth A began to kick doors again\nbefore moving towards Staff 1. Staff 1 blocked a kick from Youth A\nand Youth A fell to the floor. Supervisor 3 reported not observing\nthe whole restraint but once Youth A was on the floor, she got on\nthe floor with him. Staff 1 informed her she needed to call the\nnurse, so she left to call the nurse. Nurse Manager called\nSupervisor 1 and Supervisor 1 arrived with the injection form of\nmedication. While waiting, Supervisor 3 observed the restraint and\nStaff 1 informed everyone that Youth A keeps fighting and will not\ncalm down. When Supervisor 1 came on scene, she talked to\nYouth A, and he calmed down. Supervisor 3 believes Youth A\ncalmed down because Supervisor 1 was not part of the restraint.\nSupervisor 3 reported Supervisor 1 informed staff she will not give\nthe injection because the prone position was inappropriate, and\nSupervisor 3 was unaware that a prone position was\ninappropriate. She is unaware if prone position is taught in training\nand not all staff are aware that you can’t use a prone position. She\nwas unsure why she didn’t stop the restraint and she reported she\nwould not have started the restraint to begin with.\nClinician was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/2/23\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported going to “get\na kid” for a therapy session when she observed Youth A in a\nrestraint in the hallway. She walked over to him to see if she\nwould be able to speak to him. She also reported Youth A was\nface down, while yelling and screaming. Staff 1 had his left arm,\nStaff 2 had his right arm, and Supervisor 2 was “on his feet”. She\nreported her attempt to speak with Youth A did not calm him\ndown, but she knows he calmed down after the restraint. She\nbelieves all of the staff including herself are trained in restraint\ntechniques and she learned later in a staff meeting that prone\nrestraints are inappropriate. She reported the thought that the\nrestraint was inappropriate didn’t cross her mind and stopping it\nnever occurred to her.\nTrainer was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/2/23 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported being in the\nposition of training restraint techniques at the facility for the past 8\nyears. He also reported it is never appropriate to conduct a prone\n7",
    "position restraint and if you happened to end up in a prone\nposition staff are to turn the youth over as soon as possible or just\nlet go. None of the restraint trainers teach prone position restraints\nand they are told to cross out the prone restraint and bear hug\nfrom the training guides. Trainer believes it is not safe to hold a\nyouth in a prone position as opposed to not safe to move a youth\nfrom a prone position. The reported restraint training is Non-\nViolent Crisis Intervention (NVCI) which is part of Crisis\nPrevention Intervention (COI).\nCourt Worker was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/2/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported he has\na good rapport with Youth A and is able to help Youth A calm\ndown when he is having a bad day. He also reported staff’s\nintervention is generally to talk to Youth A and help him calm\ndown. The normal consequences Youth A receives are reports\nand write-ups rather than restraints. Youth A has informed Court\nWorker that he feels safe in the program.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/2/23\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported thinking\nabout his brother and got caught up emotionally in some “stuff”.\nHe remembers grabbing a pencil and going after Staff 1. He\nbelieves he deserves getting hurt because of what he did. He also\nreported trying to kick Staff 1 and having Staff 1 turn him over\ncausing him to go to the ground. He was crying and struggling\nbecause of the pressure on his arms and legs and it being hard to\nget staff off of him. He reported asking them “nicely” to get off of\nhim and when he struggles in life, he makes mistakes. He also\nreported being in a lot of pain from staff grabbing him and wanted\nto “curl up in a ball”. He wanted staff to stop because of the pain\nbut “they just would not listen to me”. He stated, “I was on the floor\nfor an hour because I was on the struggle bus”. He reported\nstopping his struggling once staff let go of him and just talking\nabout the restraint makes him nervous. He does not feel safe at\nthe facility because he feels like he will be attacked again by both\nstaff and other youth.\nNurse Manager was interviewed via phone on 8/16/23 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported receiving a call\nthat the impulse program (where Youth A is lodged) needed help.\nWhen getting to the scene, she was informed they were in a\nrestraint and needed medication because their nurse was not\npresent today. Staff 1 had asked her to hold Youth A’s legs and\nshe did for approximately 2 minutes. After this she left and called\nthe doctor while going to get the medication. She also reported\n8",
    "Supervisor 1 told staff she would not administrator the medication\nto Youth A because he was in a prone position which was\ninappropriate. Nurse Manager spoke to Complainant right after\nleaving the scene to inform her of the inappropriate restraint. She\nreported staff are not supposed to place a youth in a prone\nposition and Youth A presented as not struggling. Youth A “looked\nlike he just wanted to get out of the hold” and she heard him say\nseveral times “just let me go”. Nurse Manager also reported not\nsaying anything about the inappropriate restraint because “just\nmissed it”. She believed she was experiencing stress over the\nnumber of hours she had been working because the facility is\nnormally short staffed.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nIncident Report 159400208 Dated 7/25/23. This document is the\nincident report for the prone restraint conducted on Youth A. This\ndocument does not describe the type of restraint beyond staff\nmembers securing Youth A’s right arm, left arm, and legs. It is\ndescribed that Youth A “continued struggling in an effort to free his\narms and legs and telling staff he was trying to stab and harm\nthem. This document also states Youth A said, “releasing the fire\nwithin himself”.

This document summarizes the\npatient advocates investigation of the restraint of Youth A\noccurring on 7/25/23. She was notified the day of the occurrence\nby Supervisor 1 and Nurse. Staff 1, Staff 2, Supervisor 2, and\nNurse Manager were identified as participating the restraint and\nSupervisor 3 and Clinician witnessing the restraint. Interviews with\nSupervisor 1, Nurse, Staff 1, Supervisor 2, Staff 2, Supervisor 3,\n10",
    "Nurse Manager, Clinician, Trainer, and Youth A were completed.\nTwo CPI-NVCI instructors were interviewed, and both reported\ninstructing their classes to never do a prone restraint and if the\nyouth gets into the prone position, they are to let go or re-adjust\nand re-hold if necessary. This report has a detailed review of the\nvideo surveillance, and it is noted Youth A was observed moving\nhis extremities 6 times for less than 1 minute each time during the\nwhole restraint. Differences between the interviews conducted for\nthis report by licensing and the descriptions of interviews\ncontained in the Patient Advocate report are as follows.\n• Supervisor 1: in a written report she stated Staff 1 informed\nSupervisor 1 that he was unable to move Youth A from a\nprone position because “he is trying to hurt us”.\n• Staff 1: He stated to the Patient Advocate he was told if a\nkid is down not to turn him over if he’s secure. He also\nstated I was always told it’s better to secure any way we\ncan because I have to look out for the staff too.\n• Supervisor 2: She stated to the Patient Advocate, Youth A\nshould not be in a prone position and attempts were made\nto get him over. She also stated staff were trying to\ndeescalate him and every time they tried to release him, he\nbegan to struggle.\n• Staff 2: He stated to the Patient Advocate, Youth A was\ngoing to stab me, but Youth A was around 5 feet away and\nhe wanted to let Youth A go but Staff 1 said to secure\nYouth A. He also stated, CPI NVCI tells us to secure in\nwhatever way we can and I’m not sure what our prone\npolicy says.\n• Supervisor 3: She stated to the Patient Advocate, Staff 1\ninformed Supervisor 1 he could not move Youth A from a\nprone position because he was still struggling.\n• Clinician: She stated to the Patient Advocate, Youth A was\nmore squirming than fighting and knew Youth A should not\nbe down in a prone position, but I was focused on de-\nescalating him.\n• The conclusion of this report outlines that all staff involved\nhave completed the updated CPI NVCI training which\nincludes no use of a prone restraint. At no point did any\nstaff verbalize the need to let Youth A go or turn him over\nwith the exception of Supervisor 1 and Staff 2. The majority\nof the time during the restraint as evidenced by the video\nrecording indicates Youth A was not moving his extremities.\nIt is also noted the trainer and other training staff concluded\nthere were multiple opportunities for Youth A to be moved\nto a safe position or roll to a supine position. The Patient\nAdvocate concluded Staff 1 caused nonaccidental physical\n11",
    "injury to Youth A and child abuse is substantiated. Because\nof the length of the restraint and prone position, child\nneglect is substantiated.\nCompliance Hotline Investigation Report number 2023-7-xxx\ndated 7/25/2023. This document identifies Administrator 2 as the\ninvestigator and Supervisor 1 as the complainant. The principal\nallegation is staff used an unauthorized hold on Youth A.\nIndividuals interviewed include Staff 1, Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2,\nSupervisor 3, Nurse Manager, Clinician, and Trainer. The\nsummary of this report indicates the video recording does not\nsupport interviews that multiple attempts were made to turn Youth\nA out of the prone position or release the hold. It is documented in\nthe interviews Staff 1 stated he tried multiple times to turn Youth A\nover but wanted to maintain a secure hold on him to keep Youth A\nfrom self-harm and harming staff. Staff 1 also admitted to knowing\nprone restraints are not approved but was uncomfortable moving\nYouth A. Staff 2 admitting to knowing he needed to move Youth A\nto another position but was following the orders given by Staff 1.\nSupervisor 2 admitted to overhearing Staff 2 tell Staff 1 they\nshould turn Youth A, but Staff 1 insisted on maintaining position.\nShe also heard Youth A say, “I promise I’ll stop”. She stated\nunderstanding prone restraints are prohibited. Supervisor 3 gave\na similar report during her interview. Nurse Manager gave a\nsimilar report with the addition of hearing Staff 1 tell Supervisor\n“we can’t turn him over”.

    "Investigation Supervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/2/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Supervisor 1\nreported being involved after receiving a call that medication was\nneeded for Youth A. Nurse Manager was present first after\nreceiving the call but had to call Supervisor 1 because the\nappropriate medication was not on the floor (box) at the time.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/2/23 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 1 reported the restraint\nlasted as long as it did because when Nurse Manager showed up\nfor medication, there was no medication on the floor (box) and\nmore medication had to be called for.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/2/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. When Nurse\nManager arrived, she informed staff she didn’t have the\nmedication but was willing to assist holding the legs of Youth A.\nSupervisor 3 told her to leave and find medication which is\nnormally in the medication room but for some reason someone\nforgot to restock the medications. Supervisor 3 also reported new\nmedication is stocked every Wednesday and if someone takes the\nlast of the medication they should restock. She reported they had\nthe correct medication on site but needed the injection form not\nthe pill form.\nNurse Manager was interviewed via phone on 8/16/23 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She found there was only\noral medication available, so she called the hospital (across the\nstreet), and Supervisor 1 brought the medication.

She reported\nbeing employed as the Assistant Chief Nursing Officer for the\nfacility. She was not working at the time of the incident and did not\nhave any contact with Youth A until approximately a week and a\nhalf ago. She reported the nurse who examined Youth A following\nthe restraint is to fill out the “Post Intervention Face to Face\nEvaluation” within an hour after the restraint ends. She believes\nNurse Manager put her notes in the clinical note rather than filling\nout the appropriate form. She also reported the process of the\nEmergency Injectable Box involves the nurse who is assigned to\nthe unit (not present the day of the incident) or any nurse who\ntakes medication from the box is to fill out the medication form\n15",

The nurse is to\nimmediately assign a staff member to conduct continuous in\nperson observation/monitoring for the duration of the restraint.\nStaff are also to document the readiness for discontinuation of the\nrestraint and document every 5-minutes their assessment of\nobserving, measuring, and evaluating the physical statues of the\nyouth.\nMedication Administration Policy dated 7/2023.
