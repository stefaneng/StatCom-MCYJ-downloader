Just after returning to\nher office, she observed PT specialist immediately get up and\nasked aloud “where is she going” and attempt to follow Parent 1\nand Youth A who had left the parenting time area and walk\ntowards the exit door of the suite. The initial thought was maybe\nParent 1 had taken child to use the restroom so that was the first\narea that staff checked. Upon learning from PT specialist that\nParent 1 and Youth A had left the visitation she checked all floors\nof the building to look for them. In addition, PT specialist and\nParent 2 were also looking for them. FCW stated Parent 1 and\nParent 2 regularly use the stairwell and not the elevators. The\ncamera inside the visit room does not capture any activity once\nsomeone turns the corner. FCW stated she has observed PT\nspecialist during other visits and has never had any concerns that\nshe wasn’t adequately watching visits. FCW stated as a result of\nthis incident the agency is amending their procedures for\nobserving supervised parenting time.

    "into view of the camera which is consistent with her statement she\nprovided a drug screen to another client that reported to the office.\nThroughout the video Parent 1 and Parent 2 are observed\nwhispering but it is difficult to determine what is being discussed\nbecause father plays music on his phone throughout most of the\nvisit and the child, at times, played with loud toys. Parent 2 can be\nheard saying “you should have complied” several times. Parent 1\nmakes comments regarding Youth A not being fed properly and\nhaving marks on him. Parent 1 sits on the floor while holding\nYouth A who is asleep for approximately 30 minutes.
