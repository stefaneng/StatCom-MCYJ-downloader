    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted following an allegation that a supervisor at the Lincoln Center juvenile facility kneed and slapped a youth during a physical altercation on January 30, 2025. The investigation, which included interviews with multiple staff and the youth (who refused to answer questions), review of video footage (without audio and with no camera in a key room), and medical records, found insufficient evidence to substantiate the youth's claims. While the report concludes no violation was established, the incident involved a youth with a history of aggression and a physical restraint that resulted in a hospital visit, highlighting a volatile situation. The weight of the staff's consistent accounts against the uncooperative youth's initial allegation leads to a finding of no formal culpability, though the altercation itself points to systemic challenges in managing such incidents.",
