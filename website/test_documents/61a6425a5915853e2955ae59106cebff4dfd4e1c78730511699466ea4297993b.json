    "The Chief Administrator indicated that previous year CAP was effective. The\nagency utilizes an external consultant for human resource activities. An\nonboarding checklist was developed to ensure compliance moving forward. The\nPQI is currently fully staffed, and the agency feels this will improve compliance.

The Chief Administrator expressed\nconfidence that several areas will improve over the next review period.\nFinancial Overview\nFinancial records were reviewed and there were no concerns identified.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported the agency\ndoes a good job keeping everyone connected despite working remotely.\nSupervisors and coworkers are available and assist as needed. Staff did not report\nany areas of need or concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency does not have a physical location so a walk through was not\ncompleted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n________5/30/2023___________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 1, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
