    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 7/16/21, a staff member at the facility threatened to burn all of a youth's toys.\nStaff member pushed youth against the wall by the throat when they attempted to\nprotect their toys. Youth hit their head on the wall and has a mark on their face from\nthe incident.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 07/19/21 and investigated jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Consultant 2 was also present during the 07/20/21 interviews. The\ncomplainant reported the following:\nYouth A (12) lives at Methodist Children's Home. Staff 1 is an employee at the\nhome. On 7/16/21, Staff 1 threatened to burn all of Youth A’s toys. Youth A ran to\nhis room to protect his toys and Staff 1 pushed him against a wall by his throat.\nYouth A hit his head on the wall and currently has a mark on his face from the\nincident. Youth A has been taken to an urgent care to be evaluated. Youth A was\nsent home and is suspended pending an investigation.\nI interviewed Youth A on 07/20/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. Youth A\nreported that this incident occurred on 07/16/21 when Staff 1 said that she was\ngoing to burn his “stuffies” and that she had a lighter. Youth A said he had been\nacting out (standing on the couch, being hyper, and jumping around). Youth A said\nthat he ran to his room to protect the stuffed animals and on the way Staff 1 took him\nby the neck and put him against the wall. This reportedly occurred by the bathroom\nnear his room. Youth A explained that Staff 1 grabbed his neck with one hand from\nthe front. Youth A said that Staff 2 and Youths B and C saw this occur and Youth A\nsaid that Staff 2 was shocked. When asked how he knew Staff 2 was shocked,\nYouth A said that Staff 2 put her hands up over her face. Youth A said that Staff 1 let\ngo of him and Youth A ran out the door. Youth A was not sure how long Staff 1 held\nhis neck, indicating he “blacked out.” Youth A said he ran to another cottage where\nanother staff let him in and talked to the Supervisor. Youth A said that he told the\nSupervisor what happened. Youth A said he was taken to urgent care by Staff 2, and\nhe did not have any marks, bruises, or scratches. Youth A said Staff 1 left after he\nran out of the cottage, and he has not seen her since. Youth A said that he feels\nsafe, has been at the facility for about six months and nothing like this has happened\nto him before.\nI interviewed Youth B on 07/20/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. Youth B was not\nforthcoming during the interview and reported that he did not want to talk about this\nbecause Staff 1 is his favorite staff and is good to him. Youth B said that he was not\ngoing to “snitch” on Staff 1 and have her get her own child removed from her. Youth\nA said that she might get her child taken because other DHHS workers came to talk\nto some people, and they had come to his house when he was taken from his\nmother. Youth B did not provide much detail related to the incident, and only\nconfirmed that he saw Youth A run toward his room.\n4",
    "I interviewed Youth C on 07/20/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. Youth C\nprovided a consistent account of the incident with Youth A’s. Youth C could not\nrecall how or where on Youth A’s body that Staff 1 grabbed Youth A. Youth C stated\nthat Staff 1 was forcing Youth A to apologize for spitting on Staff 1 in another\nincident. Youth C went on to report that Staff 1 had grabbed him a couple of months\nago by his hands and put him in the corner near the kitchen table.\nI interviewed Staff 2 via phone, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. Staff 2 has been at\nthe facility less than three months. Staff 2 recalled this incident and reported that\nStaff 1 was angry from a prior incident when Youth A spit on Staff 1. Staff 1 wanted\nan apology, but Youth A was not giving it. Staff 2 said that Staff 1 was standing over\nYouth A and intimidating him. Youth A was crying, distressed, and trying to get away\nfrom Staff 1. Staff 2 recalled Staff 1 saying she was going to get a lighter and burn\nYouth A’s stuffed animals. Youth A ran to his room and there was a verbal\naltercation between Youth A and Staff 1. Staff 2 said that Youth A left from the door\nfor a moment and Staff 1 approached his bedroom door. Youth A ran back to the\ndoor and tried to get in the room. Staff 2 said that Staff 1 grabbed Youth A and\npushed him against the wall. Staff 2 said Staff 1 was pushing Youth A up and lifting\nhim by the neck/throat and choking him with her hand. When Youth A was let down,\nhe ran out the door and to the cottage next door. Staff 2 said that she followed and\nheard Youth A tell the Supervisor what happened. Staff 2 then took Youth A to\nurgent care and said that they did not find any injuries. Staff 2 said that Staff 1 left\nthe facility after the incident, and she has not spoken to Staff 1 since then.\nI interviewed the Supervisor via phone, on 08/11/21, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The Supervisor reported that Youth A ran to the cottage where he was\nand was crying. Youth A then told the Supervisor that Staff 1 choked him and\npushed him into the wall. The Supervisor said that Staff 2 was with Youth A and\nverified what Youth A said. The Supervisor said that he sent Staff 1 home, filed the\ncomplaint with DHHS, and notified management. The Supervisor said that he spoke\nto Staff 1 when she called him to say that she had a family emergency. The\nSupervisor said that he told Staff 1 to go home and that he would have had to send\nher home anyway because of what happened with Youth A. The Supervisor said that\nStaff 1 replied that nothing happened with Youth A and that she didn’t do anything to\nYouth A.\nI interviewed Staff 1 via phone, on 08/11/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. Staff 1\nrecalled this incident and reported that she had told the boys that she was leaving\nand that would be her last day. Staff 1 said that Youth A had spit at her the day prior\nand he brought it up and was mad at Staff 1. Staff 1 said that she began talking to\nother youth and Youth A continued to act up, so she told him to go to his room. Staff\n1 said that Youth A went by his bedroom door and asked her to open it. When Staff\n1 went to open the door, she said that Youth A charged at her with full force. Staff 1\nsaid that she backed Youth A up into the wall with her forearm across Youth A’s\ncollar bones. Staff 1 said that when she let Youth A go, he ran out the door and Staff\n5",
    "2 ran after him. Staff 1 denied threatening to burn Youth A’s toys. Staff 1 said that\nshe called the Supervisor and notified him that she had received a call about a death\nin the family and had to leave. Staff 1 said that Youth A was not taken to the hospital\nthat night, noting he wasn’t taken until two days later.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows, with appliable\ninformation outlined:\n Incident Report, dated 07/16/21, authored by Staff 2. The report was\nconsistent with Staff 2’s interview. The report was not approved by a\nsupervisor. On 07/20/21, Administrator 1 said that she had asked for revisions\nto the Incident Report. On 08/24/21, Administrator 1 emailed that she never\ngot the revised Incident Report, and that staff is no longer employed there.\n Urgent Care report for Youth A, dated 07/16/21.

No obvious signs of\ntrauma seen on examination. Patient has normal neurological examination.\n 07/16/21 Letter from the Director of Administrative Services to Staff 1\nconfirming Staff 1’s verbal resignation that day.\n Staff 1’s employee file was reviewed for disciplinary action:\no 05/27/21-Progressive Disciplinary Action, Staff 1 failed to use de-\nescalation techniques she was trained on, which lead to a\nconfrontation with a youth. Coworkers stepped in and walked Staff 1\nout of the cottage. A licensing violation resulted.
