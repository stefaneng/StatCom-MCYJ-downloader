Physical Description of Facility\nThe facility is located in a residential neighborhood in Westland, MI. The facility is a\ntwo story, colonial style house, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nThe exterior of the home is vinyl siding and brick. The home is less than 10 years old\nand appears to be in excellent condition. The house is connected to city water and\nsewer. Garbage collection is also through the city and is picked up on a weekly\nbasis. An Environmental Health inspection was completed on 11/26/13 and the\nfacility was given an A rating. A fire safety inspection was completed on 12/03/13\nand the facility was given an A rating.\nThe first floor has a large living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and family\nroom. All appliances in the kitchen appear to be clean and in working order. The\nfurniture, walls and floors appear to be clean and in good repair.\nMedication for residents is located in a locked cabinet in the kitchen. Within the\ncabinet, there are individual containers for each resident in order to keep medication\norganized and separated.\nThe second floor has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and storage closets for\nbedding and towels. There are five available beds, all with clean linens. When\nstanding at the top of the stairs on the second floor bedrooms A & B are to the left\nand bedrooms C & D are to the right. Bedrooms A, B and C have one full size bed\neach. Bedroom D is the largest room and has two full size beds. The agency plans\nto have four long term placements and utilize the fifth bed for a short term or respite\nplacement.\n2",
    "The basement level is locked and will not be used, except when access is needed to\nservice the furnace or hot water heater. A laundry room is located on the first floor\nand has a working washer and dryer.\nThe facility has a fenced back yard with ample space for outdoor activities.\nSchools in the area are less than five miles from the facility and provide bus\ntransportation.\nThe facility does not have a behavior management room.\nB. Program Description\nGenesis House is a five bed therapeutic residential facility for children, ages10-\n17, with autism. The program plans to accept private placements and DHS\nplacements once they obtain a contract with DHS. The program description\nstates staffing will be a 3:1 ratio. However, the director reported that staffing will\nlikely be 2:1. When there are four residents, two staff will be on duty. However, if\na fifth resident came in as short term/respite placement, the ratio would be 3:1 for\nthat time.\nAfter an intake assessment is complete and residents are accepted into the\nprogram, a treatment plan will be developed which will include: self-care,\ncommunication, motor skills, social skills, cognitive skills, daily living, and family\nrecreation. The program focuses on “normalizing life patters and each individual\nachieving his/her maximum potential”. The goal of Genesis House is to provide\nservices to the child and their family, which will improve the youth’s daily living\nskills and increase the parent’s knowledge base on raising a child with autism.\nThrough this, children and families will be empowered to have a more effective\nrelationship when the child returns to the family home.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThere were no rule violations found. During the licensing process, the facility was\ngiven technical assistance in the following areas:\nRule 109 Program Statement- The agency was advised to document how they\nplan to make the program statement available to parents and DHS. On 11/1/13,\nMs. Wood reported that the Program Statement has been added to the\nadmission/intake packet, to ensure that all parents/guardians and DHS receive\nthe statement at placement.\nRule 113 Employee Records- The agency was advised to add a CPS clearance\nand verification of education to their new hire process. In addition, the agency\nplans to utilize a Workforce Background Check. However they were advised that\n3",
    "they need to have a CPS check and ICHAT in the personnel file as well. On\n11/1/13, Ms. Wood acknowledged this requirement and reported that it would be\nadded to the new hire checklist.\nRule 141 Initial Documentation- the agency’s “pre-admission form” and “child\ninformation record” documented parts of rule 141, but not all of the required\ninformation. The agency has revised the forms to comply with this rule.\nRule 167 Reporting Hospitalization or Death of a Resident- The agency was\nadvised to notify their licensing consultant of incidents regarding residents. In\naddition, they were informed of DHS policy regarding injury, illness, or missing\nchild notification and the timeframes required.\nThe facility was provided consultation in the following areas:\nPA 116- The agency was advised to document staff “hire date” and “start date”\nseparately. This recommendation was made after observing the agency’s\npractice of documenting the “hire date” as when the offer for employment was\nmade, then completing clearances. The recommendation was made to show a\n“start date” in order to show that clearances were completed prior to contact with\nresidents.\nAdditionally, several proposed agency forms were AFC documents. The agency\nwas advised to seek CWL forms from DHS or BCAL as they would better capture\nthe required information. The forms to be replaced were the “Resident Care\nAgreement”, “Assessment Plan for Residents”, “Resident Funds Record”, and\n“Health Appraisal”. On 11/1/13 Ms. Woods reported that all AFC forms were\nreplaced with CWL forms.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nThe recommendation is to issue an original provisional license.\n01/21/2014\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n01/21/2014\nGregory V.
