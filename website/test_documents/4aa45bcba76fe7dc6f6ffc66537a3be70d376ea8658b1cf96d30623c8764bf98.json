EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan during this\nlicensing period. The corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024 Renewal\n2",
    "Inspection where it received 8 rule violations; 5 of which were repeat violations.\nThe agency successfully implemented all aspects of its corrective plan; and made\ntremendous progress with its. No rules were cited for this inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nI received and reviewed the agency’s Chief Administrator’s (CA) report dated\n8/4/2025. The report indicated with respect to repeat violations related to 30-day\nreports, action summaries, and family team meetings, its development of a\nstandardized form for the former, and training for staff and closer monitoring for\nthe latter two, seem to have been effective related to rule compliance. The CA\nalso reported that including the office manager and executive director in the\nmonitoring procedure had also improved outcomes. Additionally, the corrective\naction plan has aided them in gaining clarification around requirements for some\nrules and has diffused misinformation, such as related to completion of aspects of\nthe action summary when a youth AWOLS/leave the agency’s services, but\ntransfers to another agency.\nThe agency reported it will continue to work with its staff around compliance with\nall rules.\nFinancial Overview\nI received and reviewed a copy of the agency's March 31, 2024, independent\nfinancial audit and 2025 annual budget. No areas of concern were noted from\neither document.\nStaff Interviews\nDuring the agency’s entrance conference on 8/4/2025 I met with and interviewed\nthe program manager. I interviewed a foster care worker, youth advocate and life\nskill coach by telephone on 8/5/2025. All the staff interviewed felt appreciated\nand supported, and that the agency keeps them abreast of changes within the\nagency; and related to the agency’s contractors. No areas of concern were\nreported. Strengths for the agency were reported as the agency being small and\ntherefore family-like, and attentive to staff and youths’ needs. The area for growth\nreported as needed was also along the lines of the agency being small and therein\nnot having various resources that larger agencies appreciate, such as the ability to\ncreate TEAMS or ZOOM meetings.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nMy walk-through of the agency’s facility did not reveal any areas of concern or\nsafety issues. Personnel and client files were securely stored, and the agency\nappeared to have sufficient space and equipment for its staff.\n3",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis agency only provides independent living services. It is not contracted with the\ndepartment to provide general foster care and licensing services.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their\nregular license.\nAugust 8, 2025\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 12, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nArea Manager\n4"
