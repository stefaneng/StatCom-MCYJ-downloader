She stated Youth A has been placed in her care for\nseveral years. Maternal Grandmother stated she didn’t have any\nissues until about a year ago when Adoption worker was assigned\nto Youth A’s case. During the initial visit Adoption worker was very\nrude. She was taking videos of her home. She clarified she was\nasked prior to recording the visit and Adoption worker explained it\nwas so she could recall the layout and details of the home for her\nreport. Maternal Grandmother stated she asked the agency that\nAdoption worker not come back to her home and requested a new\nworker due to being treated poorly.\nMaternal Grandmother was asked for specific examples of how\nAdoption worker has been rude to her. She reported the tone of\nvoice that is used and accusations that are made. Maternal\nGrandmother stated she has been accused of utilizing corporal\npunishment on 3 separate occasions.

A follow up interview was conducted with\nMaternal Grandmother on June 18, 2025, via telephone. She\nstated prior to Youth A having unsupervised visitation with\nCompeting Party in Ohio there were supervised visits held locally\nin the community. After one visit at McDonald’s Youth A came\nhome and informed Maternal Grandmother, he saw Competing\nParty give Adoption worker money. She stated that was the only\noccasion Youth A told her it happened, and she reported it via\nemail to DHHS and Youth A’s Lawyer Guardian Ad Litem (LGAL)\nat the time.\nSubstitute Caregiver was interviewed via telephone on June\n9, 2025. She stated she has been present during all but one of\nAdoption worker’s visits to Maternal Grandmother’s home. She\nstated Adoption worker is rude when Maternal Grandmother asks\nquestions. She provided an example when Maternal Grandmother\nasked about visits with Youth A’s paternal grandmother, who is a\ncompeting party on the adoption, after sexual abuse allegations\nwere brought up. She stated Adoption worker told her they weren’t\ngoing to discuss that at that time. Substitute Caregiver stated she\n2",
    "spoke up and informed Adoption worker she was being rude to\nMaternal Grandmother. She stated she points out to Adoption\nworker every other visit that she is being rude. Anytime they ask\nwhy things are or are not happening and why there are things they\nneed to complete again, Adoption worker is rude. Substitute\nCaregiver stated Adoption worker has also accused Maternal\nGrandmother of corporal punishment and does not provide an\nexplanation for why she is asking or bringing it up.\nSubstitute Caregiver stated approximately 2-3 months ago she\noverheard Youth A tell Maternal Grandmother that an uncle at the\nhome of the competing party gave Adoption worker money. She\ndoesn’t think Maternal Grandmother reported that to Adoption\nworker but did report it to the LGAL.\nAdoption worker was interviewed via telephone on June 10,\n2025. She stated she has been assigned to the case since June\n2024. She stated Youth A currently resides with Maternal\nGrandmother. She isn’t sure why the allegations were reported as\nshe feels the interactions with Maternal Grandmother have gone\nwell. She stated there have been some concerns reported\nthroughout the case, and she is required to address those. She\nprovided an example of corporal punishment. During a home visit,\nYouth A mentioned Maternal Grandmother spanks him, and he\ntook a belt and hit Maternal Grandmother. Maternal Grandmother\ndenied, but Adoption worker reminded her of prudent parenting\nand discipline policy where no corporal punishment is allowed and\nreminded her to use redirection. She stated there was another\nagency worker with her during that visit, but she is no longer with\nthe agency. She stated she was not accusatory or rude but\nneeded to address it since Youth A reported it.\nOther concerns that have been brought up were regarding\nMaternal Grandmother’s allowing Youth A’s parents in the home\nafter termination had occurred. She allowed another adult\ndaughter who is a known substance abuse user around Youth A.\nShe stated there was discussion around the concerns and if she\nwas able to recognize when someone was under the influence.\nMaternal Grandmother reported she took her adult daughter to a\nknown drug house to buy drugs.

She stated she has tried to have\nanother agency worker accompany her during home visits due to\ntension and wants to ensure she has a witness to avoid any false\nallegations. Foster Care Worker (FCW) accompanied her on the\nmajority of the visits. The other workers who accompanied her are\nno longer with the agency.\nShe stated Maternal Grandmother has started having Substitute\nCaregiver at the home during any of the foster care or adoption\nvisits. She believes Maternal Grandmother is also recording the\nprivate meeting with Youth A as well. She states the reason she\nbelieves is because at the last home visit she met with Youth A\nand discussed the concerns at the home of competing party.\nWhen they walked out of Youth A’s bedroom, Substitute Caregiver\nstated “I got it all on” and Maternal Grandmother told her to send it\nto her. She stated she has visited Youth A outside, but he has a\nhard time with distractions and ends up riding his bike. She stated\nYouth A has been told not to talk to Adoption worker. She\ncompleted a Zoom visit during Youth A’s most recent visit with\nCompeting Party and at the end of the visit Competing Party\nmistakenly left her phone on and she asked Youth A why he\nwasn’t talking to Adoption worker, and he said Maternal\nGrandmother doesn’t like Adoption worker and told Youth A not to\ntalk to her. Youth A is more open when Adoption worker has\nanother worker accompany her but only provides yes or no\nresponses when it’s just her.\nAdoption worker was asked about an allegation of accepting\nmoney from someone connected to the case. She stated she has\nnever received anything from any of her clients. She stated this is\nthe first time she has heard of this allegation. She was adamant\nshe has never received anything from anyone.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nJuly 2, 2025.

She has\nbeen present during Family Team Meetings (FTM’s), court\nhearings and telephone calls where Adoption worker and Maternal\nGrandmother interacted, and she did not notice anything that was\nconcerning or disrespectful toward Maternal Grandmother.\nAdoption supervisor stated there have been a number of concerns\nbrought to their attention regarding Maternal Grandmother. They\nare obligated to address the concerns and Adoption supervisor\nfeels that is where some of the complaint is coming from because\nMaternal Grandmother becomes defensive and feels she is being\naccused. Adoption supervisor stated they don’t point the finger at\nMaternal Grandmother, but Adoption worker explains she is\nrequired to address any concerns that are brought to her attention.\nCompeting Party was interviewed via telephone on July 7,\n2025. She stated there has never been a situation where money\nor any type of gift was exchanged between her and Adoption\nworker.

    "complaint due to Youth A residing in Michigan. She contacted the\npolice department in Michigan and was told they were not\nassigning the complaint to an officer. They were hoping if law\nenforcement in Michigan became involved a CARE interview\ncould be completed with Youth A. She contacted Oakland County\nCare House twice to inquire if they would complete an interview\nwith Youth A and never got a response. In May 2025 Adoption\nworker stated she re-filed the complaint in Ohio and they did not\nassign for investigation. There is a safety plan that Youth A and\nthe cousin are not to be left alone.
