    "(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth's medication is getting mixed up and coming up missing. The\nspecific medication that is missing is a controlled substance. There are\nconcerns with medication abuse at the facility.\nInvestigation A complaint was received on 1/5/23 stating Youth A's medication is\ngetting mixed up and coming up missing. Youth A's mother said she\ndoes not open the packages from the pharmacy. She takes the\nmedication from the pharmacy directly to the facility. Just the Adderall\nwas getting mixed up not the other 3 medications. Youth A's mother\nreported she heard the facility was having problems with staff leaving\nthe job due to medication abuse.\nInterviews:\nA phone call was made to the complainant on 1/5/23. He reported he\ntalked to Youth A's Juvenile Court Officer (JCO) about Youth A's\nmedication going missing. The facility and JCO have indicated the\nissue is with mom not providing the facility with all of her son’s\nmedication but the mom said it is the youth center that is taking Youth\nA's Adderall.\nA phone call was placed to the Chief Administrator (CA) on 1/5/23. She\nis aware of the issue. Youth A's mother told the judge about the missing\nmedication and she has been doing an investigation.\nI met with the CA face to face at the facility on 1/9/23 and the CA was\nread the allegations. She reported none of her staff have left due to\nmedication abuse. She reported in mid-December she received an e-\nmail from a judge indicating she needed to conduct an investigation to\nfind out where Youth A's medication went. Reportedly, the Mom told the\ncourt that 10 days of Youth A's Adderall was missing. That was 30 pills\nas he gets them 3 times a day so the CA started her investigation. The\nCA said that during the time he did not have his Adderall mom did bring\nin his other medication. She reviewed Youth A's medication logs and\npill counts and found there were missed doses. The staff missed\npassing noon and 4pm medication because they are not used to\npassing medication outside of morning and bedtime. She stated the\nshift supervisor is supposed to count medication in. She was not sure\nwhy Staff 1 counted in pills. Their video system only goes back 15 days\nso they would not have video recordings of when the medication came\nin. Currently anyone who walks into the control room can access the\nmedication.\n4",
    "A phone call was placed to Youth A's Juvenile Court Officer (JCO) and\nhe stated he contacted the pharmacy about Youth A not having\nmedication in August/September and they reported the medication was\npicked up but they could not say who picked it up. The JCO said that on\n12/31/22 mom took a pill bottle to the youth center that was not a full\nprescription. He called the pharmacy who indicated to him that they\nwould never give a partial fill of Adderall.\nA visit to Youth A's pharmacy occurred on 1/9/23. The Pharmacist\nindicated only the parent could get a printout of Youth A's medication\nunless a court order could be provided. The Pharmacist said they can\nfill partial prescriptions but then they would need a new prescription for\ncontrolled substances.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/9/23. He stated\nhis mom has a complaint about the facility. He stated 10 days worth of\npills were missing. He takes Adderall 3 times a day, so it was 30 pills.\nHe thought Supervisor 1 was taking them because his mom told him\nthat is who she gave them to. Youth A said Supervisor 1 called the\ncops on his mom. He stated Supervisor 1 told the cops his mom took\nhis medication. He stated his mom would never do that as she knows\nhe needs his medication and she is always on top of it. He said not\ntaking his medication can hurt him. He reported sometimes he does not\nget his noon dose but gets it 1-2 hours later. The same thing happens\nwith his 4pm dose.\nMom was interviewed via telephone on 1/10/23. She reported a month\nago she talked in court about her son not getting his medication and\nthat his medication had gone missing. The Judge ordered an\ninvestigation. There were 2 occasions when she took Youth A's\nmedication to the facility. The first time the staff said they were off by 1\npill. Then she finds out he has 30 pills missing. She said the facility will\ncontact the JCO when they need refills. JCO is supposed to pick up the\nmedication from the pharmacy but the JCO was not doing it, so she did\nit. Mom clarified that it was in November that Youth A was missing 30\npills and it was Supervisor 1 that told her the pills were missing. On\n12/21/22, Youth A should have been out of his Adderall but he had 19\npills left. Mom said Youth A needs his medication or he will have trouble\ncontrolling his behavior. During the medication drop offs, the staff did\nnot count the medication with her. She would bring the pharmacy bag\nthat was stapled closed to the facility. She would never open the bag.\nShe said she never took partial prescriptions to them. If she did the\npharmacy would change the number and initial it. She said she never\ntook her sons medication. She was asked to obtain a printout from the\npharmacy to show what medications were filled for Youth A. She said\nshe would get it and provide it.\n4",
    "A phone call was made to Youth A's mom on 1/20/23. She stated she\nforgot about the pharmacy printout of Youth A's medication. She asked\nthat I text her tomorrow at noon to remind her to pick it up.\nA text message was sent to Youth A's mother on 1/21/23 reminding her\nto get the pharmacy print out. No response was received.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed by telephone on 1/12/23. She stated she\nlogged Youth A's medication in a few different times. A few times mom\nbrought all but Youth A's Adderall. One time Supervisor 1 said when\nshe counted in Youth A's medication the Clonidine was short. The\nbottle said 30 pills were in it but she only counted 28. Supervisor 1 also\nhad another staff count and the count was still 28. She then let mom\nknow. Supervisor 1 said it is preferable that the supervisor count\nmedication in but if they are not available then the staff in control can\ncount them. When medication comes in it is dropped off at the back\ndoor then staff take it and put it in the control room for it to be counted.\nThey can contact either the parent or the JCO to get medication refills.\nIn August, Supervisor 1 said she told mom Youth A was out of his\nAdderall. The JCO e-mailed the supervisors and stated mom told him\nno one informed her Youth A was out of his Adderall. Supervisor 1\nstated she e-mail the JCO back stating she did in fact tell mom.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via telephone on 1/11/23. He reported a\nfew weeks ago he noted Youth A's mother dropped off his medication\nand she said there were only 28 Adderall pills. This was a red flag for\nhim as he had never heard of a pharmacy giving a partial prescription.\nNor had he seen that the number on the bottle was crossed off and a\nnew number with an initial would be in its place. He was aware Youth A\nwent 3-4 months without his Adderall previously. Per Supervisor 3,\nthere are three different ways medication can come into the facility. The\nparent, the JCO, or facility staff pick it up and bring it in. If they have a\nrefill on the bottle they will order the refill themselves then go pick it up\nat the pharmacy. When Youth A's medication was dropped off,\nSupervisor 3 had a staff go get it from the mom as he watched on the\nmonitor. The staff brought him the medication and he counted it right\naway. The medication bottle was in a bag from the pharmacy not\nstapled. Supervisor 3 stated it was mom's initials on the bottle.\nSupervisor 3 clarified that the only time someone other than a\nsupervisor counts the medication is when the supervisor is not available\nthen the person in control does it. This is the same for passing\nmedication. Supervisors pass all medication unless they are\nunavailable then it is the person in control. This was in place because\nthey did not want too many hands on the medication, especially\nAdderall. Per Supervisor 3, they are good at remembering to give the\n4",
    "youth their medication and they have a medication reminder written on\nthe control room board.\nStaff 1 was interviewed by telephone on 1/17/23. She reported she has\nnot been at the facility for some time. She could not remember ever\ncounting Youth A's medication. She reported a supervisor would\nsometimes have her count medications when they are brought into the\nfacility if he was busy, but she did not remember if this ever occurred\nwith Youth A's medication. She did know that Youth A went without\nmedication, and she had heard it was due to mom not bringing it in.\nShe reported Youth A always got his medication if it was available. Staff\n1 reported that all staff are aware there are cameras everywhere and\nthey record everything. There is even a camera facing the medication\ncart in the control room.\nMessages were left for Supervisor 2 and Supervisor 4.\nFacility Tour:\nA tour of the facility was conducted on 1/9/2023. There is a control\nroom in the center of the facility with windows facing the two day-\nrooms. The control room was locked from the outside and only control\nor people with keys can open the door. Inside the control room is a\nmedication cart. At the time of the tour the cart was open. A Ziplock bag\nof medication sat on the desk next to the cabinet. Inside the cabinet\nwas a box with a lock on it that was not locked. In the box were Ziplock\nbags with youth names on them. There were four of us inside the\ncontrol room at the time and other staff came and went. The staff was\ntold to lock up the medication.\nDocumentation review:\n• Medication Logs: All logs from June of 2022 (when Youth A was\nadmitted) to January 9. The logs were missing a significant\nnumber of initials indicating staff passed Youth A's medication.\nMost of the missing initials were from the noon and 4pm doses.\nYouth A was out of his Adderall on 8/2/22. He did not get it again\nuntil 10/21/22. He was out of Adderall again on 11/16 through\n11/21.\n• Medication Count Logs: These logs indicated that Youth A was\nadmitted with a 30-day supply of Adderall. Between the end of\nthat first bottle and when the second bottle came in on 10/21/22\nYouth A had all of his other medication brought in by mom or the\npharmacy. On 10/21/22, 89 pills of Adderall were counted in but\nthe bottle said 90. This discrepancy is not addressed on the\nform.\n• Comparing the Count Logs with the Medication logs Youth A\nwas out of Adderall on 11/16 after getting a new prescription less\n4",
    "than a month before. The following prescription came in on\n11/21 with 90 pills, but 102 pills were passed before he ran out\nagain. Given the number of missing initials on the medication\nlogs and the number of pills that came in, all pills seem to be\naccounted for.\n• Internal Investigation Report: The following information was\npulled from CA’s report. On 12/15/22 the judge asked CA to\nconduct an investigation. A docket entry indicated mom brought\nthis concern up to JCO on 11/21/22. Supervisor 1 contacted\nmom in August letting her know Youth A would be out of his\nAdderall. She also e-mailed JCO. In November Youth A ran out\nof Adderall and Supervisor 1 let mom know. Mom told\nSupervisor 1 Youth A should not have been out of his Adderall.\nDuring CA's interview of the supervisors, they reported they were\nunaware of any staff having issues with medication.\nCommunication between JCO and the pharmacy found Youth\nA's medications were picked up in September and October, but\nthey could not say who picked them up. The pharmacy also told\nJCO the only people who could pick up Youth A's medication\nwere Youth A's mom and grandmother.\n• Medical & Health Care Services policy: Medications shall be\nadministered according to the physician's orders. The\nadministration of medication will be recorded on an approved\nform and signed or initialed by the staff member administering\nthe medication. Controlled substances will be stored in locked\ncontainers. Controlled substances on hand shall be inventoried\nonce a month and any losses should be reported immediately.\n• Youth A’s medication bottles were the same as indicated on the\ncount logs and in interviews.\nAnalysis When counting all the pills received by the facility and all the pills given\nfrom the count logs and the medication logs, it appears all pills are\naccounted for, however, the agency is in violation of the rule as the\nmedication logs indicate Youth A was out of medication in November\nwhen he should not have been and there was an abundance of pills left\nover the following month. This indicates there are deficiencies in how\nthe facility brings medication in, counts the medication, dispenses the\nmedication, and documents all of these steps. Medication logs were\nobserved to have a large number of missing initials resulting in an\ninability to determine if Youth A received his medication. During the on-\nsite medication was seen out on a desk and the medication cart was\nopen. These practices are not in line with the facility's Medical & Health\nCare Services policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current authorization status be continued.\n1/24/23\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/10/2023\n____________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
