There was not a home visit completed for the\nmonth of April 2019.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Throughout this inspection is was noted that the agency is not consistently\ncoding uploaded information for each file. Several times, the same document\nwas coding differently. The agency indicated that there are several different\nindividuals who are conducting the uploading of documents and it was\nsuggested that they develop a system that will ensure each document has a\nspecific code when uploaded.\n At least seven times, required signatures were documented on upload forms\nbut the signature was present without the date that it was signed. A\ndiscussion with the agency took place and it was suggested that they\nincrease their level of over-site to ensure that workers are obtaining the date\nalong with the signature.\n Throughout this inspection is was noted that several times documents were\nnot being loaded in the same location for each file reviewed. We discussed\nthe importance of consistent uploading and placing documents in the same\n10",
    "location for each file. They indicated that they would work on developing a\nmore consistent over-site system.\n There were several social work contacts that were not being identified as\nhome visit, thus causing difficulty in locating the home visits that were being\nconducted as required. Again, this was discussed with the agency to ensure\nthat workers entering information in the MiSACWIS system are consistent and\nuniform.\n Several DHHS-69 forms for various changes in the case file did have the\ncompleted date but were missing the effective date. We processed the\nimportance of making sure the form is completed and the agency will identify\nmethods of over-site to ensure that this is being completed.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency did not request consultation at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period. However, there was one special evaluation that involved the foster\nparents being cited for the use of corporal punishment with a foster child in the\nhome. The agency followed all requirements for an in-depth special evaluation and\ncompleted all documentation within the case file. The agency found the family to be\nin violation of Rule 400.9404. (3). The agency developed a corrective action plan\nthat was completed by the foster parents. However, the agency was cited for this\ncorrective action plan because an adult son in the home also engaged in the\n“swatting” of the foster child and was not included in the corrective action plan. This\ncitation took place under Rule 400.12327 (5) (h) Special Evaluations.\nPhone interviews were conducted with various staff, ranging from case managers to\nadministration. Each staff interviewed reported that they are adjusting well to the\ncurrent situation and have been able to maintain contact with their youth and/or\nhomes. They were able to share the procedures that the agency has taken to ensure\nthat the homes are safe. All staff report believing that administration is very\nsupportive of their efforts to provide appropriate services to the youth and/or homes.\nVII. ANALYST REPORT DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe analyst interviewed four licensed homes and three unlicensed relative homes.\nSafety identified with seven families. The concerns are as follows:\nSafety Alert #1:\nThere are electrical outlets without covers in the room where the two youngest\nchildren sleep. There is peeling paint in the two bedrooms that the children reside in,\n11",
    "and it is an older home. There is an unfinished wall in the hallway leading to the\nyoungest children's room with no plan of completion. The basement area of the\nhome, and the back hallway of the home, smells like animal urine.\nResolution: Documentation provided by the agency and documented in the\nMiSACWIS system indicated the following resolution of this concern. On 1/16/20, a\nhome visit was completed by the foster care worker and this safety alert was\naddressed with the relatives. The relatives purchased outlet covers and the worker\ndocumented this with a picture. The worker documented through pictures and a\nnarrative that on 1/24/20, the family purchased paint and painted the area which had\nchipped paint. The family also painted the unfinished wall and a narrative and picture\nwas provided. The worker documented the following when addressing the smell of\nurine in the basement:\nDue to the two oldest children being harmful to the animals in the\nhome the animals must be locked up, especially when the oldest child\nis in the home. Until the children’s behaviors stabilize the animals will\ncontinue to be in the basement while the children are awake and in\nthe home. During the time of the visit, it was Christmas break. As a\nresult, the pets spent more time in the basement as usual.\nIt was documented that the plan to eliminate the smell is to have the parents clean at\na minimum three times a week. This compliance will be monitored through monthly\nvisits by the foster care worker who will check on this specific issue.\nSafety Alert #2:\nThe relative indicated that there had never been a worker that looked in her\nbedroom at the residence as she would not allow anyone in there. The relative had\nmedications sitting all over the living room. She indicated that she had a lock box,\nbut refused to use it, as the foster child knows not to get into the medications. There\nwas quite a bit of clutter in the residence and there are at least two broken windows,\none in the front of the trailer, and one in the living room. The relative indicated that\nthey had just had a guardianship completed a couple of days before the worker\ncame out; it is unknown if the case is closed in the system. There is an approved\n3130 in the system however the 3130 has many blank areas including the\nassessment of the home, discipline plan, etc.\nResolution: Documentation provided by the agency indicates that phone contact\nwas made with the relative caregiver on 1/28/20 in which the issue of the storage of\nmedication was discussed. The relative caregiver placed all of the medication in the\nlock box and provided a picture to the foster care worker to demonstrate compliance.\nThe reported clutter was discussed, and the relative caregiver indicated that this\nclutter consisted of “craft supplies and papers”. The agency does not consider this to\npose a safety concern. In regards to the youth’s (17-year-old) room, this was\naddressed, and it was not considered a safety concern. The clutter consisted of dirty\nclothes on the floor. A case worker went to the home on April 20, 2020 to inspect the\nhome for compliance and was told by the relative caregiver that she has yet to follow\n12",
    "through with a repair to the windows. Documentation also indicates that because of\nCOVID-19 repairs have been placed on hold. This worker also asked to view the\ncaregiver’s room and it is documented that she replied, “It is none of your business\nbecause the DHHS case is closed”. The worker also documented that the caregiver\nis using the locked medication box and the “clutter” is not a safety concern. A review\nof the case file in MiSACWIS confirms this information. A review of the 3130A\nprovided the following documentation: the report is very limited on the description of\nthe different aspects, however, each section of the report is addressed. Some of the\ndeficiencies of the report include a description where the smoke and carbon\nmonoxide detectors are located, very limited description of the caregivers attitudes\ntowards the child’s parents, very limited narrative of her willingness to participate in\nthe child’s services, poor narrative to the caregivers support of the child returning to\ntheir parents, no description of the family vehicle, no license for the family dog,\nlimited information about the family being current on bills when the family identified\nthe primary stressor is financial, and almost no description of the impact of fostering.\nThere is no reference to the worker viewing the caregiver’s room nor any reference\nto any broken windows. Therefore because of the limited information provided and\nthe lack of refence to specific issues a violation was established. This is noted in the\nabove findings.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\n4/27/2020\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 29, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\n13",
