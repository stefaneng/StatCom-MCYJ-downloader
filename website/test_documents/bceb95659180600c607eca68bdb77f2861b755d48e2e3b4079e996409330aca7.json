Each youth’s\ntreatment focus is designed to meet their individual needs,\nbuild on their strengths, and help them to achieve their goals\nof returning to the least restrictive environment. The\ncommunity-based approach, along with clinical services,\nhelps to provide each child the opportunity to generalize the\nskills, they are learning to new environments, foster\nconnections and gain skills for independence and self-\ndetermination. The minimum staffing ratio of a Mental\nHealth Stabilization care is one direct care staff to two\n6",
    "youth during waking hours. Due to the ongoing needs of\nthe youth away from the program, including family\nvisitation, court hearings, medical appointments, etc.,\nadditional staff are needed to maintain the family-style\nmilieu and adequate case management. Support staffing\nmay be adjusted to meet the needs of the youth and\nprogram.\n• Safety Plan dated 1/2/2025 completed and signed by Chief\nAdministrator and MDHHS Worker stating staff will be\nscheduled to pick Youth A up after practice and\ntournaments and if alternative arrangements are made for\nan approved person to provide transportation for Youth A\nback to the facility, the facility will have direct contact with\nthe approved person to verify they will be providing the\ntransportation.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as the facility has the staff to\nprovide transportation to and from extracurricular activities for\nYouth A and never refused to pick her up. Based on the\ninterviews, Youth A was approved to receive rides from her coach\nas well as a teammate and the facility requested Youth A provide\ntimely notice if she was not going to receive a ride from her coach\nor teammate so the facility could plan to provide the\ntransportation, which Youth A did not always provide timely notice\nto the facility. The facility has opted to provide all transportation\nfor Youth A to eliminate last minute planning moving forward.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n1/17/2025\n______________________________________\nJennifer Pastorick Date\nLicensing Consultant\n7",
