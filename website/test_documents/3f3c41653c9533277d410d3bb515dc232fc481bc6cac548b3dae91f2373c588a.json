    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nAllegation On 3/10/23, two youths were alone in the bathroom together.\nInvestigation I notified Youth E’s foster care worker and Complainant/Therapist\nthat I was assigned this investigation. Neither expressed\nadditional concerns about the facility.\nI notified Rights Officer of the allegation. He alerted me that\nYouths E and A are, or were, romantically interested in one\nanother and are placed on different wings.\nI interviewed Youth E with Rights Officer present. On 3/10/23 she\nsaid she and five other youth were in the school gym playing\nvolleyball supervised by three staff. One youth was on one-to-one\nstatus supervised by Staff 3. The other five were being monitored\nby Staffs 1 and 2. Youth E described the gym bathroom as a\nroom with multiple stalls.\nYouth E said she went into the bathroom for privacy to read a two-\npage letter from Youth A. Note: Passing letters among residents\nis prohibited. After reading the first paragraph, Youth E said\nYouth A surprised her by entering the bathroom. “I ran out (of the\nbathroom) when I was able to. Staff 1 was approaching to get her\n(Youth A) out.”\nYouth E would not discuss what was said or done in the\nbathroom. She said there is only one youth allowed in there at a\ntime.\nI interviewed Youth A with Rights Officer present. She claimed\nshe went into the bathroom without permission and was not aware\nYouth E was in there. She said she and Youth E are “just friends”\nand nothing happened in the bathroom. “Youth E just walked out\nof the stall.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 with Rights Officer present. She has worked\nat Vista Maria for eight years. On 3/10/23, Staff 1 said she, Staff\n2, and Staff 3 were supervising six youth in the gym. “I was\n2",
    "monitoring the exit door and sat at the far end of the gym away\nfrom the restroom. I saw Youth A go in the bathroom.” Another\nyouth shouted that Youth E was already in there. “I ran to the\nbathroom…It was a matter of seconds. Youth E came out as\nsoon as Youth A went in. Youth E had an irritated look on her\nface.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 via telephone. He has worked at the facility\nfor 22 years. Staff 2 corroborated Staff 1’s account of the staff\nsupervision in the gym.\nRights Officer and I viewed video of the gym. Youths E and A\nwere alone in the bathroom for 37 seconds when Staff 1 reached\nthe bathroom. According to both youths, nothing happened in the\nbathroom.\nThis investigation and report were completed before Government\nWorker 1 was assigned to investigate it. Government Worker 1\ndid not substantiate.\nAnalysis The direct care staff were providing sufficient supervision and\nintervened appropriately upon noticing Youth A entered the\nbathroom without permission.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMarch 17, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 11, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n3",
