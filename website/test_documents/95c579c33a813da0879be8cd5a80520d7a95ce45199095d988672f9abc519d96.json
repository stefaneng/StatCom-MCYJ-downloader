The Nurse reported she sees the\nyouth at the facility approximately once a week. She records and\nmonitors the children's height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate,\nand pulse oxygen. The Nurse reported that Youth A has had a\n\"serious weight loss\" while at the facility. She reported she\nencourages Youth A to eat, and he frequently says the food is\nnasty at the facility. She reported on 4/5/23 Youth A saw the\npsychiatrist and his medication was adjusted to help with his\nappetite. Youth A is reportedly starting to eat more frequently\nand has had a small weight gain in the past month. The Nurse\nreported she is responsible to make referrals for the youth's\nmedical needs if she feels they need additional services or\nassessments. She has scheduled Youth A with a dietitian but had\nnot consider having him assessed for an eating disorder. The\nNurse reported that Youth A has not dropped into a low weight\npercentile even though he has had a significant weight loss. The\nNurse did not feel Youth A needed to see a doctor about his rapid\nweight loss or that he has reached an unhealthy weight. Youth A\nis schedule to have his well child exam tomorrow. Youth a refused\nto attend his well child exam earlier in the month indicating he\ndoesn't like doctors or getting shots.\nYouth A's therapist is currently out on FLMA, and the Clinical\nDirector was able to provide a statement regarding Youth A's\ntherapeutic services on 4/21/23. Her statement indicated Youth A\nand his Therapist discuss healthy body image, healthy diet and\nlifestyle in therapy. Youth A denies having an eating disorder and\nexpresses that he just prefers certain foods over others. Youth\nA's Therapist makes sure to have some of his favorite snacks in\nher office for sessions. The foster care worker recently informed\nus that his sister has an eating disorder – she is bulimic and\nbinges and purges. We do not have any concerns that Youth A\n7",
    "has bulimia. Youth A appears to be a very picky eater and very\nstubborn. Youth A is diagnosed with PTSD, ADHD and ODD. He\ntakes two medications for ADHD and three medications for mood\nstabilization.\nThe Residential Director reported Youth A refuses to do many\nactivities. He refused to have his blood drawn so had to be taken\noff one of his medications due to it requiring blood draws to\nensure safe levels of the medication in his system. Youth A\nrefused his well-child examination last week refusing to get into\nthe car to go to the appointment. The Residential Director reported\nshe is unsure how to address this as they cannot make the youth\ngo to the doctor or get in the car. The Residential Director\nreported she does not want to make a big deal about food and\neating as she knows this could make the issue worse. They\nprovide the youth with meals and snacks and offer him alternative\noptions should he not like what is being served. The Residential\nDirector reported Youth A has lost about 50 lbs. since being at\nChrist Child House and she has noticed he has dark circles\naround his eyes. Youth A is reportedly a picky eater and refuses\nto eat frequently. The facility has recently begun documenting\nwhat he eats and refuses at each meal. The nurse keeps a\nrunning log of Youth A's weight.\nI interviewed Youth Specialist 1 and 2, Supervisors 1 and 2 and\nYouth B at the facility on 4/18/23, jointly with the Government\nWorker. All staff h interviewed reported Youth A is a picky eater\nand that he came to the facility chuncky and has had a significant\nweight loss. The staff reported they have begun to track and log\nthe food Youth A eats and refuses each day. The staff reported\nYouth A is offered Ensure and several food options at mealtime.\nThe staff all reported they monitor Youth A after meals to ensure\nhe is not purging his food and they do not believe that he is\npurging.\nYouth A was interviewed briefly by the Government Worker at\nschool on 4/5/23 and he refused to discuss food/weight issues. A\nsecond interview was attempted with Youth A on 4/18/23 at the\nfacility jointly with the Government Worker. Youth A refused to\nmeet or be interviewed.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews there is no evidence that supports Youth\nA's health is not being monitored and assessed appropriately.\nYouth A's health is being monitored and assessed weekly by the\non-staff Nurse. According to the Nurse Youth A has lost a\nsignificant amount of weight, but he has not dropped below the\n8",
    "50% percentile in weight and the Nurse does not feel Youth A has\nreached an unhealthy weight range. The nurse has set up Youth A\nto see a dietitian. The facility has responded and continues to\nrespond to youth's weight loss by tracking his food intake,\nencouraging and having Ensure for him, offering food options,\nkeeping foods he likes on hand, and weighing him monthly since\nadmission. The nurse and therapist encourage him to eat and try\nnew foods and to attend his doctor appointments.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: It is recommended that Youth A\nhave a medical/psychiatrist evaluation to specifically rule out an\neating disorder. The facility should provide Youth A's historical\nweight chart, daily food intake log and food refusals to all future\ndoctor and psychiatric appointments. It is recommended the\nfacility solicit assistance from youth's foster care worker to\nfacilitate his attendance at all scheduled doctor appointments.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n04/21/2023\n______________________________________\nTracey Ventola Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 25, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n9"
