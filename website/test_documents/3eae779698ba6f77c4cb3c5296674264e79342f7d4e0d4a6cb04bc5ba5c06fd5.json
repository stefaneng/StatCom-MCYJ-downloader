She stated Staff 1 tried to hit\nYouth A on purpose. She stated she did not know what to do so she \"blacked out\",\nbut when asked, did not know what \"blacked out\" meant. She stated that Staff 1\nprobably scratched her.\nStaff 3 Interview: Staff 3 stated the management with Youth A happened on the 9th\nwhich was a Saturday or a Sunday. The group was watching a movie and Staff 3\nwas passing nighttime meds. Youth A thought that another youth was talking about\nher. Youth A began yelling at her peer.

The staff attempted to restraint Youth A but Youth A had grabbed\npencils and was stabbing staff with them. Staff 3 took the pencils out of Youth A's\n3",
    "hands. The staff again attempted to restrain Youth A but she was kicking and pulling\nthe staff's hair. They continued to try and manage Youth A and get her to calm\ndown. Staff 1 called for additional staff. Staff 1 was holding Youth A's legs so she did\nnot kick them. Staff 3 was holding one of Youth A's arms and Staff 2 was holding the\nother. Staff 3 stated she never saw anyone hit Youth A in the face or pull Youth A's\nhair. After the restraint Staff 3 did not see Youth A.

Staff 2 and Staff 1 each had an\narm. She could not remember what Staff 3 was doing. Staff 4 and Staff 5 came in\nand talked to Youth A. Staff 2 went to take a break. Youth A was telling Staff 4 and\nStaff 5 that the other staff had attacked her. Staff 2 stated no one pulled Youth A’s\nhair. Staff 1 did not hold Youth A's head. Staff 2 just blocked her own face from spit\nby putting her hand to her own face. No one harmed Youth A or escalated the\nsituation. No one said staff hit Youth A not even Youth A. After every restraint Youth\nA says staff hurt her. Staff 2 has been off on medical leave since the incident and\nhas been diagnosed with a concussion.\nSupervisor Interview: The Supervisor stated he was the Evening Campus\nSupervisor the night of the incident with Youth A.

Youth\nA stated she was going to get Staff 1 fired. Youth A said she got hit in the face, but\nshe did not know who hit her in the face. Youth A also said the staff stabbed her with\na pencil. Youth A just said \"one of them\" did it.\nThe Supervisor went to another unit and saw Staff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 3. He asked\nthem what happened. They told him Youth A went into the kitchen and staff went to\nget her out then Youth A attacked them. He asked them why Youth A was saying\nthey hit her, and the staff denied they had.
