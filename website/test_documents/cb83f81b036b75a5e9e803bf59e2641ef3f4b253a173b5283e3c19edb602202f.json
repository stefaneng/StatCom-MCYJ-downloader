The complaint noted the following:\nYouth A (15) is at Kalamazoo County Juvenile Home. Staff 1 is staff at the\nfacility. Staff 1 hit Youth A with an open hand.\nI conducted an unannounced onsite visit on 01/13/21 jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. We interviewed the Deputy Director (DD) who provided us with the\nsupporting documentation. The DD provided a verbal review of the incident, noting\nthat Youth A, Staff 1, Staff 2, and Youth B were playing cards. Youth A looked at\nStaff 1’s cards and Staff 1 “swatted” Youth A’s face away with the back of his hand.\nThe DD said they all continued playing cards for several more minutes. When in the\ndining room later on, another youth mentioned that he heard Youth A got “popped”\nby Staff 1. This is when Youth A asked to speak to a supervisor and reported that\nStaff 1 “smacked the shit out of me.” The DD said that the Chief Administrator was\nnotified, and the administration reviewed video of the incident and gathered written\nstatements from the involved parties. The DD reported that this incident occurred on\n01/05/21. The DD said that Staff 1 was removed from working with Youth A until the\ninvestigation is done. The DD said that they did not initially feel that this was abuse\nand were conducting their investigation with the Union involved so Staff 1 was not\nprovided the formal allegations until 01/12/21. This was also when the report to\n3",
    "Centralized Intake was made. The DD stated that the facility does not allow physical\ndiscipline.\nI reviewed the video for this incident. Two camera views were provided. Camera\nview 1 is captured from behind Youth A, who was seen seated across a square table\nfrom Youth B. Staff 1 was seated to the left of Youth A and across from Staff 2. The\nfour were playing cards. About 10:27:27, Youth A was seen leaning to his left and\nappeared to be trying to look at Staff 1’s cards. Staff 1 looked at Youth A and\nsmacked Youth A in the face with the back of his hand. This did not appear to be a\nhard smack. Youth A leaned back in his chair while Staff 1 was seen talking. Youth\nB got up and walked around laughing. Youth B sat back down at the table and the\nfour continued playing cards for several minutes.\nCamera view 2 was captured facing Youth A. The same activities were viewed as\nthe participants played cards at the table. About 10:27:27, Youth A looked at Staff\n1’s cards. Staff 1 looked at Youth A and smacked him in the lower jaw on Youth A’s\nright side, with the back of his hand. This was not observed to be a hard smack. The\nevents were consistent with Camera view 1.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility, on 01/13/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nYouth A reported that he has been at the facility for about one month and does not\nlike being there. Youth A reviewed this incident and reported that he was playing\ncards and looked over at Staff 1’s cards. Youth A said that Staff 1 told him not to\nlook at anyone’s “motherfucking hand” and then said that Staff 1 “slapped me.”\nYouth A said that he sat there for a minute and about 20 minutes later, he told a\nsupervisor. Youth A demonstrated how Staff 1 hit him with the back of Staff 1’s\nhand, and pointed to his lower jaw/cheek area. Youth A said that Staff 1 hit him hard\nand that it hurt. Youth A said he was shocked and did not know why Staff 1 did it.\nYouth A said that he played it off until a supervisor came around. Youth A said that\nnothing like that had happened to him here before this. Youth A said that he has\nseen Staff 1 but has not worked with him since the incident. Youth A said he did not\nhave any marks or injuries from the incident. Youth A said that he does not feel safe\nin the facility since this occurred and he thinks he is going to be moved to another\nPOD due to reporting this incident.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility, on 01/13/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nYouth B reported that he was playing cards when Youth A looked at Staff 1’s cards.\nYouth B said Staff 1 put an arm out like “get back.” Youth B said that he did not\nknow if Staff 1 said anything to Youth A. The group went to lunch after this incident.\nYouth B said that he did not know if they were mad at each other afterward. Youth B\nstated that no staff have put their hands on him while in this facility.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility, on 01/13/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 2 said that there was not much to this incident. Staff 2 recounted playing cards\nwhen Youth A peaked at Staff 1’s cards a couple of times. Staff 2 said that “out of\nthe blue Staff 1 swatted at Youth A” and contacted Youth A’s neck. This was noted\n4",
    "to have been with the back of Staff A’s hand. Staff 2 said that Youth A laughed about\nit and they finished the game. Staff 2 said that he thinks Youth A was embarrassed\nbecause the other kids started joking about it. Staff 2 has not seen Staff 1 be\naggressive with any kids and works with Staff 1 daily. Staff 2 said that he heard Staff\n1 say something like “why are you looking at my hand.” Staff 2 said that Youth A has\nnot and will not receive any consequences for reporting this as the staff do not take\nthis stuff personally.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility, on 01/13/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 1 recalled the incident and said he was playing cards with Youth A, Youth B\nand Staff 2, when he saw Youth A out of the corner of his eye. Staff 1 said that\nYouth A being close to him startled him and Staff 1 threw his arm/hand out and said,\n“What are you doing? Why are you so close?” Staff 1 said that the back of his hand\ncontacted the right side, clavicle/neck area on Youth A. Staff 1 said that they\ncontinued the card game and from his assessment, it was not serious. Staff 1 said\nthat he thought Youth A was stunned too. Staff 1 said that Youth A was not hurt, or\nhe would have called a nurse. Staff 1 denied hitting Youth A hard and said that he\ndid not see any marks on Youth A and Youth A did not make any report of being\nhurt. Staff 1 denied having contact with Youth A since this incident. Staff 1 said that\nthis was a “definite accident” and that he has a “great relationship” with all of the\nkids. Staff 1 denied that Youth A was given or would receive consequences for\nreporting. Staff 1 denied that Youth A would have to change PODS due to this. Staff\n1 stated that another youth was kind of teasing Youth A about it and he told that\nyouth to stop immediately because they do not allow the kids to tease each other.\nI interviewed the Chief Administrator (CA) via phone on 01/27/21 regarding this\ninvestigation. The CA provided additional detail regarding the process of events and\nexplained that when the video of the incident was reviewed on 01/05/21, the facility\ndid not feel that Staff 1’s action was “abuse” under the child protection law, but\nrather “horseplay”. The CA did not feel that it needed to be reported. The CA stated\nthat when he received and reviewed the written statements on 01/12/21 he read that\nYouth A said Staff 1 swore at him when he hit him. The CA said that he assessed\nthe situation then needed to be called in to Centralized Intake as Staff 1 could have\ntaken this action out of anger, which then needed to be assessed by a DHHS\nSpecialist. It was at this time, and because of the additional information, that the\nfacility made to report to Centralized Intake.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Probation Officer (PO) via phone, on 02/01/21, jointly with\nthe DHHS Specialist. The PO reported no concerns regarding safety at the facility.\nThe PO had been advised of this incident by the facility.\nI interviewed the complainant via phone on 02/16/21. The complainant reported that\nhis report and written statement are accurate to what he knew about the incident.\nDocumentation reviewed for this investigation includes the following, with applicable\ninformation noted:\n5",
    " Incident Report, dated 01/05/21, authored by Staff 1. The report was\nconsistent with Staff 1’s interview.\n Initial written statement from Youth A, dated 01/06/21. Youth A wrote that he\nwas playing cards and looked at Staff 1’s hand. Youth A wrote that, ‘I look\nagain and he slap me and face and said you don’t look at my mother fucking\nhand…’ ‘…like 20 minutes later it was make it into a joke like it was funny so\nthat when I told the supervisor.’\n Deputy Administrator’s interview notes with Youth A, dated 01/06/21. Youth A\nstated, ‘I was looking at his card and then he sacked my face and said, “What\nyou looking at motherfucker?” Youth A also said that he did not think Staff 1\nwas trying to hurt him, but he was embarrassed in front of his peers.\n Supervisor A’s interview notes. Youth A reported the incident to Supervisor A.\nSupervisor A reviewed the video and noted the incident, then made a report\nto the CA and Deputy Administrator. Staff 1 was moved to another unit to\nseparate him from Youth A pending an investigation. Supervisor A obtained\ninitial and written statements from Youth A, Staff 1, and Staff 2, and provided\nthem to the Deputy Administrator on 01/06/21.\n Overnight Report, 01/06/21, documenting Staff 1 was moved from the unit.\n Memo with subject: Written Notice of Allegations, to Staff 1, dated 01/12/21.\n Staff 1’s employee file was reviewed.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.10169 Discipline.\n(1) A facility shall have and follow written policy and\nprocedure which stipulates that residents shall not be\nsubjected to any of the following:\n(a) Corporal or cruel punishment.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule. It was reported consistently\nand verified on video review that Staff 1 hit Youth A in the face\nwith the back of his hand. While this did not cause injury and did\nnot appear egregious, physical discipline is not permitted.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nI recommend that your CAP for the violation include your plans\nto address this particular staff, as well as a review/revision of\nyour current policy on corporal punishment. You might consider\nadding a subset or differentiation for employee actions assessed\nas intended to cause pain/injury and those that are not. DCWL\nconsiders all acts of physical discipline under corporal\npunishment, regardless of the intention to cause pain/injury.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility providing an\nacceptable and timely corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nFebruary 16, 2021\nRevised February 25, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 18, 2021\nRevised February 25, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
