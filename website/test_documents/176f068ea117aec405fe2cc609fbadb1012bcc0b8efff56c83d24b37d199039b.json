It is not contracted with Michigan Department\nof Health and Human Services therefore, MISEP requirements are not applicable.\n3.) This facility is a court operated facility. It is not contracted with Michigan Department\nof Health and Human Services therefore, contract/policy requirements are not\napplicable.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility did not require technical assistance at this time.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require consultation at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility was not required to submit any corrective action plans this licensing period\nInterviews:\nThe Chief Administrator reported since the start of COVID the facility has had trouble\nacquiring and maintaining staff for the CBT program. This program runs alongside the\ndetention. Because the detention has to be fully staffed at all times any staff hired\nneed to work in the detention when detention is short on staff. The Chief\nAdministrator continues to try and hire staff specifically for CBT. He reported when he\ndoes hire staff they leave before he has a chance to get the program fully staffed.\nBecause the program is not staffed no other staff from this program could be\ninterviewed. For other staff and youth interviews see the interim report for Eaton\nCounty Youth Facility’s detention program CO230201104.\n1",
