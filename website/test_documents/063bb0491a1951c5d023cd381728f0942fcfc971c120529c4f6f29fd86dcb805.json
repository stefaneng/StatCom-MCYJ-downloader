    "supervisor and program manager never responded to her requests to discuss her\nconcerns. Foster Care Worker and Supervisor ignored Parent A’s request to review\ncasefile. Additionally, Foster Care Worker would not send Parent A reports.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews\nParent A - On 2/7/2022 I interviewed Parent A by phone. Parent A stated that it was\n“very rare” that she was notified of the youth’s medical appointments. Parent A did\nnot provide any specifics regarding which appointment for which she did not receive\nnotification. On 4/4/2022 I followed up with Parent A via email asking if she had any\ndetails regarding the medical appointments, she alleges she was not notified of or\nallowed to attend. The only missed appointment date she identified was a date she\nbelieved to be 1/9/2019 for Youth A. A review of the case record determined that\nthere was an appointment on 1/9/2020 at which time Youth A was placed with\nCaregiver A. Parent A also stated that she was not notified of any appointments for\nYouth B; however, also stated that Youth B is placed with his father.\nParent A stated that she asked her foster care worker for therapy services since\n“day 1” of her case. She reported Foster Care Worker requested family therapy\nservices for her at court, but the court replied Parent A needed to work on her own\nissues before she could engage in family therapy. She also stated she requested\nsober living options from Foster Care Worker who stated she would contact\nsomeone about this, but never gave any sober living options to Parent A.\nParent A stated she was provided with 2 gas cards and was not offered rides by\nFoster Care Worker. Parent A stated that she had text messages documenting her\nrequests for transportation assistance that she would provide to this consultant.\nParent A reported she requested an FTM in March of 2020 because Foster Care\nWorker stated Parent A wasn’t being honest or cooperating with services. Parent A\nalso stated she made a request to review her case file, but Foster Care Worker did\nnot respond to this request. Parent A reported Foster Care Worker would not send\nher copies of reports such as psychiatric evaluations, trauma assessments, and\ncourt reports. Parent A stated she would have to “fight for them.” When I asked\nabout Parent Agency Treatment Plans, Parent A stated she did receive all of those,\nbut they were never discussed with her.\nFoster Care Worker - On 2/9/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker in person at\nthe agency. Foster Care Worker reported Parent A attended nearly all of the youth’s\nappointments. Foster Care Worker stated Parent A’s visitation was supervised by\nher mother, Caregiver A, with whom the children were placed, and Parent A could\nattend any appointments Caregiver A brought the children to. Foster Care Worker\nstated there was one dental appointment Parent A could not attend. This\nappointment was scheduled after Youth A was moved from Caregiver A’s home and\nParent A could not attend due to the dentist office only allowing one person to be at\n3",
    "the appointment. Parent A’s visits were to be supervised; therefore, she could not\nattend the appointment with Youth A.\nFoster Care Worker reported Youth A’s therapist did not feel family therapy was\nappropriate until Parent A engaged in her own individual therapy and addressed her\nown history which was discussed during Family Team Meetings (FTMs.) Parent A\ndid not actively engage in individual therapy services. Foster Care Worker reported\nParent A was not actively engaged in services overall which is required by sober\nliving programs. Additionally, after denying substance use for several months,\nParent A eventually admitted to substance use which also prevented participation in\nsober living programs.\nFoster Care Worker reported Parent A would typically express a need for\ntransportation assistance after she missed a drug screen despite not having pre-\nplanned with Foster Care Worker. Parent A also lived near a bus stop and all\nbussing was free throughout 2021.\nFoster Care Worker reported Parent A requested all reports from her case on the\ndate of the termination hearing. All applicable documents were emailed to Parent A\non 3/31/2021. Foster Care Worker Additionally, Foster Care Worker reported having\nmultiple conversations with Parent A about concerns she had throughout the case,\nbut at no time did Parent A make a request to file a formal grievance.\nProgram Manager- On 2/9/2022 I interviewed Program Manager in person at the\nagency. Program Manager stated after Parent A expressed her concerns to Program\nManager about missing one of Youth A’s appointments after the youth was replaced,\nshe talked with Parent A and offered to have a meeting to discuss her concerns\nwhich Parent A declined. Program Manager reported that she has had multiple\nconversations with Parent A throughout the concerns she expressed, but Parent A\ndid not request to file a grievance.\nSupervisor - On 2/9/2022 I interviewed Supervisor in person at the agency.\nSupervisor provided the same information as Foster Care Worker regarding the\nfamily therapy, substance abuse service, and transportation concerns.\nSupervisor reported having a conversation with Parent A during which Parent A\nreported having asthma as a barrier for walking to the bus stop and not having an\ninhaler due to Medicaid not covering the inhaler. Foster Care Worker verified Parent\nA’s inhaler was covered by Medicaid and assisted her with scheduling the needed\nappointment.\nSupervisor reported speaking to Parent A many times throughout the case and\nfrequently discussed Parent A’s concerns, but she did not request to file a grievance.\nCaregiver A – On 4/11/2022 I interviewed Caregiver A by phone. She reported she\ndid notify Parent A of the youths’ appointments, but Parent A did not attend. Parent\n4",
    "A was heard in the background of the call saying that Caregiver A did not tell her\nabout appointments. Caregiver A stated she didn’t know if Foster Care Worker\nwould allow Parent A to attend appointments with her.\nDocuments Reviewed\nOn 4/4/2022 I reviewed the following in the MiSACWIS case record:\n Family Team Meeting (FTM) documentation from an FTM held on 6/2/2020\nindicated Parent A was encouraged to assist Caregiver A in making\nappointments. This documentation also indicated Parent A’s parenting time\nwas flexible and based on Caregiver A’s schedule as they were supervised by\nCaregiver A.\n Parent A and Youth A’s need to engage in and make progress in individual\ncounseling was discussed during FTM’s for which documentation of Parent\nA’s attendance was recorded on 11/20/2020, 3/31/2021, and 3/17/2021.\n Parent A’s service plans and treatment plans which documented her lack of\nengagement in substance abuse services as well as overall services\n Case referral documentation verifying that referrals were made for Parent A\nfor mental health evaluation, counseling services, substance abuse services,\nparenting support, and housing assistance.\n Narrative within social work contacts, service plans, and FTM documentation\nregarding Parent A’s refusal to sign releases of information in order for Foster\nCare Worker to receive documentation from Parent A’s therapist in order to\nverify participation.\n Social work contact dated 5/26/2021 documenting a video conference during\nwhich Parent A reported having issues with transportation. Foster Care\nWorker documented Parent A had not previously expressed this barrier and\nidentified bus stops near Parent A’s home.\n Social work contact dated 7/13/2022 during which Supervisor again had a\nconversation with Parent A about the bus stops. Parent A stated there was\nroad construction near one of the bus stops and Supervisor confirmed this did\nnot interfere with the bus pick up and offered to call the bus station with\nParent A who declined. It was also during this conversation that Supervisor\nassisted Parent A with scheduling an appointment to address her asthma.\n Social work contacts regarding parenting time. Of the visits scheduled, Parent\nA attended all except 1, which she cancelled due to her “ride being stuck in\ntraffic.”\n Documentation that Treatment Plans were provided was confirmed through\neither Parent A's signature on the Treatment Plans or documentation of\nParent A’s refusal to sign.\n Multiple social work contacts during which discussions were held between\nFoster Care Worker, Supervisor, and Parent A regarding the concerns\nexpressed in this complaint.\n5",

Parent A reported her mother,\nCaregiver A, was told Caregiver A could not attend hearings by Supervisor and\nFoster Care Worker, but Parent A did not have any additional information.\nFoster Care Worker - On 2/9/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker in person at\nthe agency. Foster Care Worker stated Caregiver A did participate in all virtual\nhearings held, while that was an option, but did not attend in-person hearings. Foster\nCare Worker reported she did have a discussion with Caregiver A during which she\nrecommended Caregiver A attend all court hearings as Parent A was not being\nhonest with Caregiver A about the case.\nCaregiver – On 4/11/20222 I interviewed Caregiver A by phone. She stated that\nalways received the notices of hearings, but they did not indicate what the hearings\nwere about. She stated that, after the first hearing, she got the impression that that\nshe shouldn’t be interested in what was going on with Parent A and felt that there\nwas an insinuation that she shouldn’t attend. She also stated that she was busy with\n6",
    "the youth in her care and couldn’t attend all of the hearings. She stated that no one\never told her she could not attend.\nDocuments Reviewed\n On 4/11/2022 I reviewed the Notice of Hearings (DHS-715) for 9 hearings, all\naddressed to Caregiver A and dated prior to the hearing dates.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\n722- 10 COURT HEARING NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS\nState and federal law requires courts to ensure certain parties\nare notified of proceedings held with respect to a child under the\njurisdiction of the court. To facilitate this process the supervising\nagency is required to provide notification of all court proceedings\nto the following:\n• • The child, if the child is 11 years or older.\n• The foster parents, relative caregivers, court-ordered\nunrelated caregivers, and pre-adoptive parents.\nANALYSIS: There is no evidence to support Caregiver A was told to not\nattend court hearings.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nFoster Care Worker and Supervisor have not given Parent A or Caregiver reason for\nmoving the children.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews\nParent A - On 2/7/2022 I interviewed Parent A by phone. Parent A reported she has\n“no clue” why the children were moved from the placement with her mother to\nanother home. She stated she did participate in an FTM about the move, but the\nreason for the move was not discussed. She stated her mother filed an appeal\nregarding the move.\nFoster Care Worker - On 2/9/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker in person at\nthe agency. Foster Care Worker reported Parent A attended all FTM’s and three\nwere held specifically regarding placement in Caregiver A’s home. Caregiver A was\nalso present for these meetings.\nCaregiver A – On 4/11/2022 I interviewed Caregiver A by phone. Caregiver A\nreported that she didn’t know the children were being moved from her home until\nshe received a notice of the move in the mail. She reported that she attended all of\nthe FTM’s but she did not remember them talking about reasons the children could\nbe moved from her home. She stated that she was informed about the move by the\n7",
    "children weeks before she received the notice in the mail and they told her they were\nbeing moved because Caregiver A needed to work on herself.\nCaregiver A reported that she attended the Foster Care Review Board hearing by\nphone during which time she found out they were concerned about the placement\ndue to Caregiver A’s boyfriend having moved into the home without Caregiver A\nnotifying Foster Care Worker. Additionally, Caregiver A’s boyfriend had a “record.”\nCaregiver A reported that was her “fault” for not notifying Foster Care Worker and\nstated that she was given the “big licensing book” but she didn’t make it all the way\nthrough.\nDocuments Reviewed\nOn 4/4/2022 I reviewed the casefile in MiSACWIS I located the following:\n Documentation from a 3/17/2021 FTM regarding placement stability which\nParent A and Caregiver A attended. Specific concerns with the placement\nwere documented to have been discussed during this meeting as well\noptions to avoid replacement.\n Documentation from an FTM on 3/31/2021 which Parent A attended, but\nCaregiver A declined to attend. During this meeting Parent A asked about the\nyouth moving and when she was told they were, she cussed at the worker\nand ended the meeting.\n Documentation from a 4/15/2021 FTM, which was attended by Caregiver A,\nParent A, and several other parties involved in the case including the youth’s\nGAL, during which it was determined that the youth would be moved from\nCaregiver A’s home based in the documented concerns.\n Foster Parent Notification of Move (DHS-30) dated 3/312021 documenting\nCaregiver A’s refusal to sign.\n Foster Parent Appeal Investigation completed by the Foster Care Review\nBoard on 4/15/2021 indicating that the board supported the move and\ndocumented Caregiver A was present for the appeal process.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(3) The agency shall document all of the following in the\nchild's record before a change of placement occurs:\n(f) Notification to the parents, referral source, lawyer\nguardian ad litem, and courts when applicable, of the\nchange in placement.\n(i) That the current foster parent was notified in\nwriting of the following information:\n(i)Not less than 14 calendar days in advance, of\nthe change, except when prior notification would\njeopardize the child’s care or safety.\n(ii)Of the current foster parent’s rights concerning\nthe change in placement.\n8",
    "ANALYSIS: The documentation supports Parent A and Caregiver A were\ninformed of the concerns resulting in the replacement of the\nyouth on multiple occasions. Additionally, the required notice\nwas provided to Caregiver A.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nFoster Care Worker informed Parent A that missed visits due to foster family or\nagency would be made up, yet none were.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews\nOn 2/7/2022 I interviewed Parent A by phone. Parent A reported a few visits were\ncancelled by the agency due to car trouble, the youth being on vacation with the\nfoster family, etc., but make up visits did not take place. She reported she would\nsend text message exchanges with Foster Care Worker regarding the missed visits.\nOn 2/9/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker, Supervisor, and Program Manager in\nperson at the agency. Foster Care Worker stated there were 1 or 2 visits missed\nduring the case. She reported she told Parent A that the visits would be made up if\nthe FSW could make them up. On 3/24/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker,\nSupervisor, and Program Manager again in person at the agency. Foster Care\nWorker reported she thought the FSW had dealt with the makeup visit and Parent A\ndid not bring it up with her until after Parent A’s right to the youth were terminated.\nDocuments Reviewed\n On 2/7/2022 I reviewed screenshots of text messages between Foster Care\nWorker and Parent A. These messages were as follows:\no Text which was not dated, but was just prior to a text dated 6/2/2021,\nfrom Parent A stating “So when can the one visit be made up?”\no No response to this question from Foster Care Worker, rather the next\nmessage was from Foster Care Worker asking Parent A to confirm her\nattendance at an appointment on 6/2/2021.\no Text from Parent A dated 7/1/2022 asking when her visit would be\nmade up.\no No response for Foster Care Worker.\no Text from Parent A dated 7/6/2022 again stating a visit was supposed\nto be made up and asking when that would take place.\no Foster Care Worker responded that she doesn’t handle visits and\nParent A would need to discuss that with the FSW “if they can make up\nthe visit”.\n Supervisor provided me a written response to Parent A’s visit concern which\nstated: Visits may be cancelled by the agency due to unsafe weather\nconditions, holidays or unexpected emergencies. For holiday visits, the staff\n9",
    "ensures that the families receive at least one visit that week. Workers will try\nto accommodate a make-up visit or a longer visit however it is not always\npossible to do so.\n On 3/28/2022 Supervisor sent an email stating the FSW had documentation\nof text messages between her and Parent A confirming a visit on 5/27/2021\nwith one of the youths. Supervisor stated the FSW did not think the visit with\nthe two youth who could not attend because they were camping needed to be\nmade up and Parent A did not mention it again until after her parental rights\nwere terminated. She added Parent A did not show up for a meeting\nscheduled with Foster Care Worker on 6/2/2021 during which Parent A could\nhave addressed her missed visit.\n On 3/30/2022 Supervisor provided me with screenshots of the following text\nexchanges between Parent A and FSW:\no A message dated 5/27/2021 from FSW “are you doing visit today”\no Parent A - “there is no visit today”\no FSW - “with Youth B?”\no Parent A – “I was told there will not be one .. that it was rescheduled”\no FSW – “That’s not what I was told”\n On 3/30/2022 I reviewed the agency policy/procedure regarding parenting\ntime which was provided by supervisor. This document stated the following:\no Parenting time cancelled due to weather will not be made up.\no Parenting time cancelled by the biological parent(s) will not be\nrescheduled.\no If you miss three (3) or more consecutive parenting times, your parenting\ntime is taken off the schedule and a meeting needs to be scheduled with\nyour Foster Care Worker to discuss different options that would work for\nyou to be able to attend your parenting times.\no When the agency is closed for holidays, you will have a minimum of one\nparenting time that week.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06I Frequency of In-Person Parenting Time\nThe minimum frequency guidelines for in-person parenting time\ndetailed below are to be followed immediately upon out-of-home\nplacement, unless otherwise ordered by the court: • Newborn to\nage five: twice per week. • Six years and older: once per week.\nNote: The caseworker must not reduce the frequency of an\nexisting parenting time plan due to a child reaching age 6. If\nparenting time is not occurring as outlined above, the barriers\nthat are contributing to less frequent parenting time and how\n10",
    "those barriers are being addressed must be documented in the\ncase service plan\nANALYSIS: Foster Care Worker did not ensure that all required visits were\nprovided to Parent A and directed Parent A to FSW regarding\nrequired makeup visits, failing to ensure these visits took place.\nAdditionally, the agency policy violates the DHHS policy\nregarding parenting time as the agency must provide either at\nleast one of two visits per week, based on the age of the child,\nand cannot refuse to make up required visits due to weather, the\nparent missing 3 consecutive visits, or agency closure due to\nholidays. Additionally, the agency cannot refuse to make up\nvisits simply based on a parent’s cancellation as there may be\nlegitimate circumstances requiring a parent to cancel.\nSupervisor and Foster Care Worker reported visits are made up\nwhen possible, but that it isn’t always possible. This is a direct\nviolation as all visits missed due to the agency or foster parents\nmust be provided.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable CAP, I recommend no change to license status.\nApril 5, 2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 12, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"

    "summary": "An investigation was conducted into complaints against Family & Children Services Inc. regarding services to a parent, notification of court hearings, reasons for moving children, and makeup visits. Three allegations were unsubstantiated, but the agency was found to have violated policy by failing to ensure required makeup visits occurred after cancellations by the agency or foster family. Ultimately, while most claims were not supported, the agency's failure to provide required makeup visits and its internal policy that conflicted with state requirements establish clear responsibility for this violation.",
