    "Michigan Department of Health and Human Services\n(MDHHS) policy.\nReceipt of the medical passport by the above listed\nparties is documented in MiSACWIS by uploading the\nsigned and dated signature page into the Health Profile\nsection.\n2 of 8 open youth case files reviewed did not contain all required medical\npassports/signatures. One file did not have one medical passport updated quarterly\nand the other did not have a medical provider signature on any medical passports.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• SER's must include all completed interviews within the evaluation needed\nto support the findings. Reliance on DHHS investigator findings and report must\nnot be used as they do not investigate potential rule violations.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• DCWL rules require an agency worker and supervisor signature on all\nservice plans, despite policy no longer requiring these signatures.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were 4 incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. All of the evaluations initiated due to allegations of corporal punishment\nwere reviewed. Technical assistance was provided regarding the information in one\nevaluation and all others were found to be completed thoroughly and accurately.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The one\nCAP submitted was in response to the 6/2022 licensing renewal inspection report\nand was approved on 6/6/2022. That CAP addressed 12 violations, 10 of which\nhave been adequately addressed as evidenced by not being repeated during this\ninspection. The two violations repeated during this inspection, PATP signatures\nand overdue adoptive family assessments were not found to be pervasive or\nchronic and attempts to achieve compliance in both rule areas were documented.\nFive violations were established during this inspection that have not been cited\nduring the past two licensing reviews. Four of the 5 were single, isolated incidents\n6",
    "of non-compliance. The fifth was located in 2 of 8 files. Overall, the violations\nfound during this inspection are the result of staff missing timeframe deadlines,\nnew staff needing additional education, and outside factors causing delays in\nobtaining/completing required signatures/documents and do not represent agency\nlack of attempts to achieve compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was received and reviewed during the\nentrance conference. The chief administrator identified barriers to compliance\nrelated to high staff turnover/transition as well as a change in agency director.\nNearly half of the child welfare team has left/changed during the period under\nreview leading to periods of needed education and training. The chief\nadministrator completed a thorough and accurate assessment of non-compliance\nand developed an appropriate CAP.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were identified.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nNo concerns were identified. The staff/supervisors interviewed reported feeling\nsupported during agency staff transitions and stated they receive the supervision\nand guidance needed.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to perform required\njob functions. Files are stored securely in locked cabinets within locked rooms that\nprevent unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nDCWL Analyst identified one safety concern as follows:\nSafety Alert: On 2/8/2023 the smoke alarm outside of the children's bedroom was\nbeeping and the family did not have a replacement battery.\nResolution: Provider replaced the battery on 2/9/2023. Photo verification was\nprovided.\n7",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMay 26, 2023\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 26, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
