    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this\nrule:\n(f) A record of any convictions other than minor traffic\nviolations from either of the following entities:\n(i) Directly from the Michigan State Police or the equivalent state\nlaw enforcement agency, Canadian province, or other country\nwhere the person usually resides or has resided in the previous\n5 years.\n(ii) From an entity accessing either Michigan State police\nrecords or equivalent state, Canadian province, or other country\nwhere the person usually resides or has resided in the previous\n5 years.\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of human\nservices, the equivalent state or Canadian provincial agency, or\nequivalent agency in the country where the person usually\nresides, that the person has not been determined to be a\nperpetrator of child abuse or child neglect. The documentation\nshall be completed not more than 30 days prior to the start of\nemployment and every 12 months thereafter.\nOne of six new employee files reviewed lacked criminal history and central registry\nclearance prior to hire date. This was on a rehire employee.\nR 400.4114 Tuberculosis screening for employees and volunteers.\nThe licensee shall document, prior to employment, that each\nemployee and volunteer who has contact with residents 4 or\nmore hours per week for more than 2 consecutive weeks is free\nfrom communicable tuberculosis. Freedom from communicable\ntuberculosis shall be verified within the 1-year period before\nemployment and shall be verified every 1 year after the last\nverification or prior to the expiration of the current verification.\n1",
    "One of nine employee files reviewed lacked Tuberculosis screening verification\nevery 1 year after the last verification or prior to the expiration of the current\nverification.\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time specified in this\nrule:\n(e) Three dated references which are obtained prior to\nemployment from persons unrelated to the employee and which\nare less than 12 months old.\nOne of six new employee files reviewed lacked three dated references obtained prior\nto employment which were less than 12 months old. This was on a rehire employee.\nThe employee was rehired on 08/31/2021 and the references were dated\n08/25/2020.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a MISEP violation. Please note that there\nare additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The\nfacility is in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract/Policy violation. Please\nnote that there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nRFCJJ 2.11 Reentry/Aftercare Services\ne. Service Levels\n2) Level 2: Level 2 reentry/aftercare services to be provided\nwhen the youth does not have services provided by CMH,\nanother plan, or a service approved by MDHHS juvenile justice\nprogram office.\nI. Face to face contact must be made weekly for the first 30\ndays post release.\nII. Face to face contact must be made twice a month for the\nsecond month post release.\nIII. Face to face contact must be made monthly for the\nremaining months.\nOne of two closed files reviewed did not have the Level 2 Aftercare Services\ncompleted per contract as the facility did not complete the required face to face\ncontacts. It is noted there were no face-to-face contacts completed, but only\ntelephone follow up.\n2",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n All Initial Service Plans and Updated Service Plans must be signed by an\nindividual that meets the social services supervisor qualifications.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n Lakes Area is now meeting with youth as part of their admission process and\nwill be providing youth with information regarding the program to help them\nprepare for placement. This will be documented in the preparation for\nplacement section and a general physical and emotional state of youth at the\ntime of admission.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans during this period\nunder review. One CAP was in response to the 2021 Renewal Inspection dated April\n12, 2021, where they were found in non-compliance for rules 400.155 (1) Initial\nTreatment Plan- second repeat violation, 400.156 (1) Updated Treatment Plans, and\n400.4116 (1) Chief administrator responsibilities. A CAP was approved on 4/22/2021\nand was effective as those violations were not repeated during this inspection.\nThe second CAP was in response to special investigation 2021C0128050, with a\nCAP approval dated 10/25/2021, where they were found in non-compliance for rule\n400.4108 (c) Financing and audit. The agency is in compliance with their CAP, as\nthey are awaiting a final financial audit, they received an additional grant, and they\ncontinue to comply with their CAP requirements.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator reported becoming the social services worker in May 2021\nand then the Chief Administrator in January of 2022 as a barrier to rule compliance\nfor the facility. The facility implemented a new process to ensure service plans are\ncompleted timely and report recognizing the importance of submitting a complete and\nthorough service plan is instrumental in the treatment of youth placed in the program.\n3",
    "Interviews\nI interviewed three youth during the onsite visit. The youth interviewed reported\nfeeling safe, having someone to talk to at the facility and feeling respected and\ntreated well by staff. The youth were all attending school. I spoke with three staff\nwho reported feeling supported in their job and having resources needed to complete\ntheir job functions. There were no concerns noted by youth or staff.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on their regular license.\nApril 7, 2022\n________________________________________\nJennifer Pastorick Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 12, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
