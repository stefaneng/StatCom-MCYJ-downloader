Youth with a legal status of young adult\nvoluntary foster care who also reside in an independent living placement included.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nThe facility was not in need of consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were zero incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. The agency conducted a timely special investigation, and interviewed the\nappropriate parties. The foster parent admitted to grabbing the back of a youth’s\nneck in response to the youth slamming his computer on the table. The foster\nparent self-reported to the agency what had occurred. The agency found the family\nin non-compliance where a corrective action plan was required.\n11",
    "AND\nThe facility has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The first was in response to Interim\nInspection completed on December 11, 2019.\nThe second was in response to Special Investigation 2020C0103040. A\ncomplaint was received that the agency failed to follow up on resident's physical\nhealth at the facility where he was placed. They failed to ensure he was safe and\ncared for. The agency was found in non-compliance for Rule 400.12206 Staff\nQualifications as the case manager failed to review the Residential Service Plans,\nand Rule 400.12420 as the case manager did not include information in the service\nplan from the residential provider. Additional citations included Medical Passports,\nface to face contact entry, FTM documentation, and signatures on the parent agency\ntreatment plan.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan that was approved on\nOctober 21, 2020 where the agency was to train staff on responsibilities, and\ndocumentation requirements now, during orientation, and yearly. Supervisors will\nmeet with new hires weekly to provide direction, and review documentation in\nMiSACWIS prior to approval of service plans including medical passports, FTM\nactivity reports, and signatures. Home visit checklists are to be turned into\nsupervisor, documenting signatures. Medical passports will be signed monthly. Staff\nand Supervisors will review BOB and maintain quiet time. Program Managers will\nreview Infoview two times a month for compliance. Pattern of staff non-compliance\nmay result in disciplinary action.\nCAP Compliance Review: I reviewed staff meeting minutes of 10/15/20 that\ndocumented a review of staff responsibilities have occurred. The agency has not\nhired any new staff since the corrective action plan was approved, however the\norientation checklist was verified to have been updated and included staff\nresponsibilities for documentation. Also as no new staff have been hired, weekly\nsupervision was not able to be verified, yet through review of a random sample of\ncase files reviewed, staff are often receiving supervision more than once a month. I\ninterviewed supervisors that reported they are reviewing MiSACWIS during case\nservice plan review to ensure documents are present. Home visit checklists are\nbeing completed as verified in review of a random sample of case files and uploaded\ninto MiSACWIS. During interviews with staff and supervisors, quiet hours continue to\nbe in effect and staff are reviewing the BOB weekly. The agency noted the BOB is\nnot always accurate due to COVID changes, but they continue to use the tool to\nensure compliance.\nDuring interviews with staff they had a good understanding of the requirements for\ntimely contacts with clients and corrective action plans in place. Staff were happy\nwith the support provided by supervision. Staff all reported Catholic Charities West\nMichigan has effectively communicated during the pandemic on job responsibilities\n12",
    "and ensuring staff safety. During the onsite visit, CHRI storage and disposal was\nverified to be in compliance. Personnel files were in full compliance and organized.\nVI. DCWL Field Analyst Findings\nThe information contained in this report section was collected through the interviews\nof randomly selected families that are working with Catholic Chartieis West Michigan\nGrand Rapids. There were no identified safety concerns.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be\nissued a renewal of their regular license.\nDecember 16, 2020\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 16, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n13"
