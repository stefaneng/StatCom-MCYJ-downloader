The agency has a deficit in total net assets in\nthe negative, however this has improved from the previous year’s audit. The facility\nhas a working capital in the negative, which indicates an agency's inability to pay\noff its short-term liability if they came due immediately, however this too has\nimproved from the previous year’s audit. The facilities’ financial condition will\ncontinue to be monitored in subsequent audits, however there is improvement in\nthis fiscal year's financial audit.
