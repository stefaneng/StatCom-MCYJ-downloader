    "Investigation I interviewed Complainant 1 by telephone on 01/03/2023. Complainant\n1 stated the foster parents were not allowed to have a third-party\npresent for the interviews the agency completed with the foster parents\nduring a special evaluation. Complainant 1 stated they were told that a\nlawyer was not needed as a third party because the investigation was\nnot a criminal issue. Complainant 1 reported in a subsequent email that\non May 5, 2022, Foster Care Supervisor 1 spoke with Foster Father 1\nto ask Foster Father 1 about the incident/situation that prompted the\nspecial investigation. Complainant 1 reported that on May 13 Foster\nFather 1 spoke with Foster Care Supervisor 1 for 30 minutes regarding\nthe special investigation and on May 20th he spoke with Foster Care\nSupervisor 1 for another 43 minutes and during this time Foster Father\n1 asked Foster Care Supervisor 1 if he should have an attorney present\nand Foster Care Supervisor 1 told him that would not be necessary as\nthe special investigation was not a criminal matter. Complainant 1\nreported the foster family received the letter from the agency regarding\nhaving a third-party present on 05/24/2022 that was the same day that\nthe interview occurred with Certification Worker 1 and Certification\nWorker 2. Complainant 1 reported they were not given an opportunity to\nhave a third-party present at that time on 05/24/2022.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 at the agency on 01/10/2023.\nAdministrator 1 provided a copy of the completed special evaluation\nrelated to this investigation. Administrator 1 reported the foster parents\nwere informed about having a third-party present at the time the\ninterview took place on 05/24/2022. There was a discussion with me\nand Administrator 1 at that time regarding the timeliness of the\nnotification and rule compliance as well as best practices.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nA copy of the special evaluation report was reviewed. The report\nindicated the notification letter was given to the foster parents on\n05/24/2022 at the time of the home visit and corresponding interview.\nThe report also indicated the foster parents declined at that time. There\nis also documentation sent with the completed report to the foster\nparents that they could have their written response submitted as an\nattachment/addendum to the completed report.\nAnalysis It was confirmed by Complainant 1 and agency staff, as a part of\ninterviews that were completed as well as the completed special\nevaluation report, that the foster parents were provided notification\nregarding having a third-party present for the interview that was\ncompleted as a part of the special investigation. There is some concern\nthat the notification provided was just prior to the interview that was\ncompleted, however it is also noted that the foster parents were aware\nof this ability well in advance of the interview based on the foster\n4",
    "parents report of the contacts/conversations with agency personnel on\nMay 5th, 13th, and 20th prior to receiving the formal notification letter\non 05/24/2022. It is also appropriate to note that the third party did not\nneed to be an attorney as this was not a criminal matter but could be\nany other support person. The completed special evaluation report\nindicated the foster parents declined having a support person present.\nInformation received indicated/confirmed the foster parents were given\na copy of the completed special investigation report.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy.\nIt is recommended that the current license status be continued.\n02/14/2023\n_____________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n03/02/2023\n____________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
