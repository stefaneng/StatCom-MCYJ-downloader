    "DHHS Policy Family Team Meeting\n722-06B\nThe Family Team Meeting (FTM) is an essential component of\nMiTEAM, Michigan’s Child Welfare Practice Model. FTMs serve\nas the primary forum for safety planning, collaborative service\nplanning, service identification, and assessing progress. The\nFTM represents a child-centered, family-driven, strength-based,\nteam-guided approach, designed to engage families in\ndeveloping plans for the safety, permanency and well-being of\ntheir children and family.\nFTMs should include child welfare staff, parents, caretakers,\nfoster parents, children, youth, and may also include extended\nfamily, friends, neighbors, community-based service providers,\ncommunity representatives, tribal representatives, for Indian\nchildren, or other professionals involved with the family.\nDuring the FTM, participants work together to create a plan for\nsafety, placement, and permanency tailored to the individual\nneeds of each child. This process provides a forum to share\nideas and opinions and stresses the importance of the family’s\nperspective and involvement. In addition, this process\nencourages full participation of all participants, honest\ncommunication, and promotes dignity and respect.\nFAMILY TEAM MEETING PROTOCOL Case planning is a\ncooperative effort in which the child and family’s strengths and\nneeds are assessed in partnership with the family, caseworker,\nand other team members.

Each meeting must be documented in\nMiSACWIS using the FTM hyperlink and all of the appropriate\nforms must be completed for each type of meeting.\n10",
