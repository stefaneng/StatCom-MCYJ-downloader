Youth A has no marks or bruising, and no other\ndetails were known.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant X\n3",
    "On 8/18/2023 I interviewed the complainant, Youth Worker (YW)X\nby telephone. YW X reported she is a youth & family worker for\nYouth A at Vista Maria. She reported transporting Youth A to a\nsibling visit at Ennis Center for Children (ECC) in Pontiac,\nMichigan that was supervised by Oakland County Department of\nHealth and Human Services (DHHS) Foster Care Worker (FCW)\n2. YW X reported she was not present during the sibling visit. Nor\nthe alleged incident of the worker hitting Youth A. Youth A told her\nlater, that she was hit by FCW 2. YW X reported how the latter\ncame to be. She reported that after dropping Youth A off for the\nvisit, which was supposed to be from 4:00pm- 5:00pm she left the\nECC building. She later received a text from FCW 2 around\n4:30pm advising that FCW 2 was ending the visit. YW X was not\nsure why the visit was ending early, but upon returning to the ECC\nbuilding, she observed Youth A’s older sister, Youth B exiting the\nbuilding followed by Youth A. As YW X advised Youth A that\nYouth A could not leave, YW X heard Youth A yell to Youth B\ntwice, that FCW 2 hit her. Youth A did not say where she was hit.\nYW X reported after getting Youth A into the van to transport her\nback to Vista Maria, the person driving the vehicle that transported\nYouth B to the visit, pulled up next to her. Youth A and Youth B\nexchanged some words (YW X did not disclose what words were\nexchanged) at that time. Youth B’s transport person, believed to\nbe Youth B’s grandmother, told the two youths that they could not\nbehave the way they had, or they will not be able to visit one\nanother. YW X reported it was at this point that Youth A stated, “I\nknow, but she hit me and that was triggering me.” At that time,\nYouth A did not say who the “she” referred to. YW X offered to\nspeak with Youth A about what had occurred, but Youth A did not\nwant to talk. YW X said she completed an incident report about\nthe matter. YW X did not know whether Youth A had been one to\nreport untruths about matters. She reported during the weeks that\nYouth A has been at Vista Maria, Youth A has presented as pretty\ntruthful, but Youth A’s past history indicates some lying behaviors.\nYouth A\nOn 8/21/2023 I interviewed Youth A (age 14) onsite at her Vista\nMaria residential facility. Youth A reported that every three weeks\nshe visits with her siblings at ECC-Pontiac. She reported her last\nvisit was on 8/16/2023 and it went okay. When I asked Youth A\nwhether an incident occurred between her or any of her siblings\nand any of the staff at the visit, Youth A reported there was an\nissue with FCW 2 and an Ennis staff person, whose name she did\nnot recall. Youth A said she and Youth B were arguing with the\nstaff. She said she and Youth B were playing around, by play\n4",
    "fighting with each other. She and Youth A were hitting each other\non their thighs, but not hard; and they were laughing and joking\naround, but not loudly. FCW 2 and the Ennis staff told them to\nstop a couple of times. Youth A and Youth B did not stop; and\nFCW 2 ended their visit early.\nYouth A denied FCW 2 or any other worker hitting her in an effort\nto try to get her to stop her behavior with Youth B. When I asked\nYouth A whether any worker hit or put hands on her in any fashion\nat the visit on 8/16/2023, Youth A stated, “no”. When I asked\nYouth A whether she ever told anyone that FCW 2 hit her, Youth\nA stated, “yes”. Youth A said she had forgotten that. She said\nFCW 2 did not hit her, FCW 2 pressed FCW 2’s fingers on her\nright shoulder in an attempt to get her to sit down. Youth A said\nthere was pressure. Youth A said she did not like the pressure,\nbut it was not hurtful. No marks or bruises were reported from the\nincident; and Youth A denied FCW 2 putting hands on her prior.\nYouth A said she told FCW 2 she did not like FCW 2 putting\nhands on her. She did not recall what if anything FCW 2 said to\nher in response. Youth A reported the incident she described\nhappened just before their sibling visit was ended. They were in\nthe ECC agency’s hallway, and chairs were located in the hallway.\nShe was trying to go outside after Youth B and FCW 2 did not\nwant her to go outside and told her to sit down. Youth A said she\ndid not want to sit down, and she went outside to talk with Youth B\nwho had gone to Youth B’s granny’s car. Youth A denied anyone\ncoming after her, she said she just went to YW X’s car, and they\nleft.\nChief Administrator 1\nOn 8/22/2023 I spoke with Chief Administrator 1 about the\ncomplaint allegation by telephone. He reported that FCW 2\ndenied the allegation that she put hands on the youth. He stated\nFCW 2 reported there were other adults around during the\nincident. Additionally, FCW 2 wrote a detailed narrative about the\nincident.\nFoster Care Worker 2 & Foster Supervisor 3\nOn 8/23/2023 I interviewed Foster Care Supervisor (FCS)3 and\nFCW 2 onsite at Oakland County DHHS:\nFCS 3 reported not being at the sibling visit. FCW 2 contacted her\nafter the visit about what had occurred. FCW 2 described the visit\nas “crazy”, chaotic; that one of the teens had said FCW 2 had hit\nher, and a Vista Maria staff person reported they had to call the\n5",
    "allegation in to centralize intake. FCS 3 reported during further\ndiscussion with FCW 2 about the matter on 8/17/2023, FCW 2\nreported during the children’s visit, the numerous siblings were all\ndisplaying emotional and behavior issues, which FCW 2 and an\nECC-Pontiac worker or supervisor were trying to manage. FCS 3\nsaid FCW 2 reported that at some point, Youth A left the visitation\nroom, went to the hallway and then went outside. Afterwards\nYouth B came inside and said to FCW 2, “you hit my sister”; and\nYouth A came in and said, “yes she did”. FCS 3 said, FCW 2\nreported never hitting or touching Youth A.\nFCS 3 reported Oakland County DHHS received this complaint\nwhen it was transferred to foster care. At that time, in an effort to\nfollow up on the matter, as well as to safety plan, she had FCW 4\ngo out and complete the safety check. FCW 4 reported upon\ninterviewing Youth A, Youth A did not report FCW 2 hitting her.\nYouth A reported FCW 2 put hands on her shoulder. FCS 3 said\nFCW 2 could not recall doing that, but admitted everything was\nhectic. FCS 3 denied FCW 2 having any disciplinary issues; or\nthere being any other complaints against FCW 2. FCS 3 could not\nenvision FCW 3 being physically inappropriate or hurtful to Youth\nA or any youth. She stated FCW 2 goes above and beyond to help\nchildren, her clients and coworkers.\nFCW 2 denied the allegation and could not recall putting hands on\nYouth A during the visitation. She affirmed information as\nreported by FCS 3 about Youth A’s sibling visit being hectic and\nchaotic. She, said, she and Ennis Supervisor (ES) 5 were there\nduring the interactions with the children; and an Ennis worker was\nin and out of the visit. The children’s Guardian Ad Litem (GAL)\nwas also present for the visit but left when the visit was called to\nan end. The GAL did not witness the later interactions.\nFCW 2 reported visitation between the siblings has always been\nchaotic, but during the visit on 8/16/2023 interaction between the\nsiblings was more difficult, they were escalated, and would not\nfollow directions. The therapeutic component they had added to\nhelp with such things was not available this day due to a personal\nmatter coming up for the therapist. During the visit, the children\nwere leaving the room and wandering. Youth A had also gone\noutside a couple of times; and FCW 2 had gotten her back in. All\nthe children were redirected to stay in the room; and Youth A and\nYouth B argued with staff about the instituted boundaries. FCW 2\nsaid Youth A and Youth B were also arguing and cursing at her\nand Ennis Supervisor 5. During a part of the visit, Youth A sat on\nYouth B’s lap, and the two youths began hitting each other; and\n6",
    "Youth A was also pulling Youth B’s hair. Things were getting out\nof hand; and Ennis Supervisor 5 redirected the girls to stop. Youth\nA and Youth B stopped temporarily, only to begin again. At one\npoint Youth B went outside to the parking lot and things were\ncalming down. Youth A also tried to go outside after Youth B.\nYouth A was in the ECC lobby and FCW 2 tried to get Youth A to\nsit down. FCW 2 said, she did not touch Youth A at all then. Youth\nA was escalated in her tone and mannerism; and said, “I’m\ntriggered.” FCW 2, reported stepping back to give Youth A space\nand Youth A sat down. FCW 2 reported, as she went to get Youth\nA’s younger brother, Child C, Youth B came back in, and Youth A\nstood up again. FCW 2 reported being concerned that the two\ngirls would start hitting each other again, doing what they reported\nwas play, but the two girls were hitting each other hard. FCW 2\nreported because of that concern, she stood in between Youth A\nand Youth B. She was facing Youth A, and her back was to Youth\nB. Youth B stated she needed to get something (what, FCW 2 did\nnot say). FCW 2 told the girls, “No we are not doing this” and FCW\n2 put her hand out, “sort of in between the two of them,” so that\nYouth A would not get to Youth B. FCW 2 reported that is when\nYouth B stated, “Why are you hitting my sister”; and Youth A\nimmediately responded, “yeah she is hitting me”. FCW 2 did not\nrecall whether she placed her hand on Youth A during this\ninteraction; she stated she definitely never hit Youth A.\nFCW 2 reported Youth A and Youth B often try to outdo each\nother in a bad way. So, when Youth B said, “why are you hitting\nher”, and Youth A quickly agreed, FCW 2 did not take the matter\nseriously. She did not think Youth A would have brought that up\non her own. But then YW X showed up and Youth A again stated,\n“she’s hitting me, or she hit me”. FCW 2 reported at that point,\nshe was in the ECC doorway with YW X. She was telling Youth A\nto come back inside. After that Youth A and YW X left the ECC\nagency.\nEnnis Receptionist 6\nOn 9/1/2023 I interviewed Ennis Receptionist (ER) 6 by telephone.\nER 6 was interviewed because per an email from Ennis\nAdministrator XX on 8/25/2023, ER 6 was at the front desk during\nYouth A’s and her siblings entire visit.\nER 6 acknowledged being present at the front desk during the\nvisit, but stated because of how her desk was stationed, she could\nnot see everything. She observed Youth A and Youth B go\noutside, heard both girls being loud and cursing staff; and heard\nFCW 2 and ES 5 trying to deescalate Youth A. She did not see\n7",
    "FCW 2 hit or hitting Youth A. Nor did she hear Youth A say,\nYouth A was hit by FCWs. ER 6 learned about the allegation from\nanother worker afterwards.\nEnnis Supervisor 5\nOn 9/11/2023, I interviewed Ennis Supervisor (ES) 5 by\ntelephone. ES 5 acknowledged being present for Youth A and\nYouth A’s siblings visit at ECC. She affirmed FCW 2 reporting\nabout the visit being chaotic, the children’s behaviors being\nescalated, Youth A and Youth B existing the building, and she and\nFCW 2’s attempts to manage the children’s behaviors and get\nYouth A to come back inside. She reported during the visit, Youth\nA was on top of Youth B, kicking Youth B’s face and side. Youth A\nwas cursing her and FCW 2 because they were redirected; and\nYouth A became upset that the visit was ended early. ES 5\nreported after Youth A had gone outside to the parking lot after\nYouth B, she got Youth A to come back inside, but Youth A was\nstill agitated. Youth A was cursing and loud. FCW 2 tried to calm\nYouth A down. FCW 2 put her hand on Youth A’s shoulder and\nasked Youth A to sit down. Youth A complied but did not stay\nsitting. ES 5 reported she was there the entire time and FCW 2\nnever hit Youth A. She acknowledged there was a point when\nshe was getting Youth A back inside the ECC building when Youth\nB screamed “You let me know if they hit you”. ES 3 never heard\nYouth A say, “you don’t understand she hit me.”\nDocumentation Review\nYouth A’s MISACWIS file which showed:\n• Youth A and her five siblings are Michigan Children\nInstitute Wards since 4/7/2023.\n• Youth A has had a number of prior placements and has\nbeen a resident at Vista Maria since 7/7/2023.\n• An 8/16/2023 sibling visitation social work narrative contact\ncompleted by FCW 2 which indicated what FCW 2 reported\nwhen she was interviewed.\n• An 8/16/2023 sibling visitation social work contact by ES 5,\nwhich indicated “the visit was overwhelming and out of\ncontrol”; as well as information reported when ES 5 and\nFCW 2 were interviewed.\nIncident Report dated 8/16/2023 authored by YW X that was\nactually a DHS-3200(Report of actual or suspected child\nabuse or neglect) which indicated:\n• During a sibling visit, Youth A made an allegation that her\nDHHS worker hit her.\n8",
