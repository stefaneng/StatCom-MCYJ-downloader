The agency opened a\nspecial investigation of this foster home and worked collaboratively with DHHS to\ninvestigate the complaint and address the actions of the foster parents.\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nOne CAP, dated 04/16/20, was submitted in response to special investigation\n2020C0207003, dated 04/06/20.

Family Team Meetings was cited\nin this inspection, thereby finding the agency CAP is not working to address the\nnoncompliance.\nOne CAP, dated 02/28/20, was submitted in response to special investigation\n2020C0207006, dated 02/14/20. A violation was noted for R 413 which was not\nfound in this inspection. This indicates the agency is following their CAP and it has\nbeen successful in addressing the issue.\nThere were 35 violations noted in the last inspection, 17 of which were repeat\nviolations. There are 33 in this inspection, 17 of which had one or more parts that\nwere repeat non-compliances. Of these, it was observed that significant\nimprovement was made in timeliness of case service plans and timeliness of social\nwork contact entries. Overall, the records were better updated as well, although it\nappeared that not all information is being uploaded timely. Additionally, it is notable\nthat seven violations were for one isolated case or one isolated instance of non-\ncompliance which is also showing improvement in consistency. It is advisable that\nthe agency focus on the repeat violations and develop robust corrective measures\nwith significant oversight to ensure they are brought into compliance during the next\nperiod to avoid potential licensing action.\nThe field analyst reported no safety concerns or alerts during their home visits.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n16",
