DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nD.A. Blodgett’s St. John’s Home Residential Campus is comprised of six residential\nhomes [Ryan, Clancy, Harmaan, Hunting, Armock, and Cebelak]. Because the Ryan\nand Clancy Homes serve a much younger population, their census is reduced to eight in\neach home. The rest of the homes are licensed for ten residents. The campus is\nsituated along a small creek in a clearing in the middle of a wooded area on Knapp\nStreet in North-East Grand Rapids. The six homes are modern, well maintained, and\nvery clean. Cebelak and Armock Homes are currently closed during a low census\nperiod for scheduled renovations. There is ample space and equipment, both indoors\nand out, for residents to be involved in a variety of activities. The homes are spacious\nand afford spaces for residents to not be crowded, even during inclement weather.\nB. Program Description\nThe DAB St. John’s Home Residential Program is an existing residential treatment\nprogram that is being assimilated into the D.A. Blodgett continuum of services. The St.\nJohn’s Home Program serves Michigan children who have been removed form their\nparents’ custody as a result of neglect or abuse and are unable to function in a relative’s\nhome or foster home. Most children who enter the program have failed in numerous\nprevious placements as a result of psychiatric issues, psychological issues, or post\ntraumatic stressors. As a result, the program is well staffed, with an additional staff\nbeing scheduled at Ryan and Clancy Homes to provide more in depth care to a younger\npopulation. All direct care staff are employed full time to reduce the amount of staff that\na resident must deal with, while at the same time providing consistency in programming\nand care. Because of relatively high pay and full benefits, there is little staff turnover and\nstaff education and experience far exceeds rule requirements, with most direct care\nstaff possessing a college degree. Residents attend community schools. Each home\nutilizes a full time therapist. Two full time nurses provide primary medical care to\nresidents. A full continuum of professional assessment and support service staff are on\n2",
    "campus or utilized in the community to meet the wide variety of resident needs. They\ninclude a medical doctor and a child psychiatrist who are on campus at least weekly.\nAdditional assessment and treatment services are utilized from community services. In\naddition to individual and group therapy, the program utilizes a large amount of varied\nactivities, both on and off campus, to motivate residents and to keep residents\noccupied. Meals are cooked family style in the homes and the quality and quantity of the\nfood is described by residents as exceptional. When residents were interviewed, they\ndescribed a high level of attention from staff, did not have concerns with any staff,\nspoke highly of their therapist, talked of their involvements in on campus and community\nactivities, and expressed a high level of satisfaction with their residency at St. John’s\nhome. A review of resident case files found them to be organized, complete, and up to\ndate.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nNone.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend issuance of a provisional license to this child caring institution, private\n– effective 1/1/2010.\n12/23/2009\nSteve Ragsdale Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n12/23/09\nDeborah Clark Date\nArea Manager\n3"
