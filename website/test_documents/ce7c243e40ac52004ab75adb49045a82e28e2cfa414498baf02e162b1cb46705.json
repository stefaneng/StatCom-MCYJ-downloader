Youth A went on a day pass\non 12/23/2023 and was drug tested upon his return. Results were\nconfirmed the same day and Youth A tested negative.

    "pen. Youth A said he was on the Pod in the main common area\nwhen the staff gave him the pen.\nI attempted to interview Youth B on 01/08/2024, but Youth B\nrefused to be interviewed.\nI interviewed Youth C on 01/08/2024 at the facility, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist. Youth C has been at the\nfacility for 6 months and is placed on Pod J. Youth C denied\nwitnessing staff members using a vape pen or giving any of the\nresidents a vape pen. Youth C reported all his needs are being\nmet, feeling safe, and expressed no concerns regarding staff\nmembers.\nI spoke with Youth A’s CMO Worker on 01/09/2024. She met with\nYouth A on 01/08/2024. Youth A told her a male staff gave him a\nvape pen, but he refused to provide the staff’s name. She said\nYouth A was being very evasive and didn’t make eye contact\nduring her visit, so she can’t be sure he was being truthful.\nI spoke with Manager on 01/10/2024 at the facility, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist. Manager reported Staff 1\nand Staff 2 worked on Pod J on 12/24/2023. She said initially\nYouth A reported it was a female staff that gave him the vape pen.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 01/10/2024 at the facility, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 1 has been working at the facility for\n6 months, has completed all new hire training, and has no\ndiscipline actions. Staff 1 recalled working on 12/23/2023 on Pod J\nand is familiar with Youth A. She denied providing Youth A or any\nother resident with a vape pen. She does not bring any personal\nitems to the Pod. She said on 12/24/2023, Youth A and Youth B\nwere talking about partying and hanging out with each other when\nthey go on the overnight home pass. Staff 1 said she doesn't bring\nanything on the Pod because after going through security, staff\nhave to lock up personal items before going on the pods.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 01/10/2024 at the facility, in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Specialist. Staff 2 has been working at the facility for\n4 months. Staff 2 is aware that Youth A and Youth B had tested\npositive for marijuana after a home pass.

She\nsaid staff are searched before entering the facility and staff are not\nallowed to have any personal items (phones, watches, etc.) on the\npods.\n3",
    "I interviewed Youth D on 01/10/2024 at the facility, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist. Youth D is currently on Pod\nC, but was previously on Pod J. He was moved to Pod C on\n01/09/2024. Youth D has been at the facility for 15 months. Youth\nD denied witnessing staff or other residents use or have a vape\npen. He has never witnessed staff giving Youths anything besides\nadvice. Youth D denied having any issues or concerns regarding\nstaff.\nA predisposition conference held with MDHHS Specialist on\n02/02/2024. There is no finding by MDHHS Specialist.\nVideo reviewed:\nI reviewed video footage for Pod J for the morning of 12/24/2023.\nStaff 1 is observed on the Pod walking around the Pod, Youth A\nwalked out of his room and spoke to Staff 1. Youth C walked\naround the common area. Youth A walked towards Youth B’s\nroom and appears to be talking to Youth B, who was still in his\nroom. Youth A again walked up to Staff 1, and they appear to be\ntalking. Staff 1 is sitting at the table in the common area. Youth A\nwalked back to Youth B’s room, Staff 1 followed him, and two\nseconds later Youth A and Youth B walked out of the room. Staff 1\nwent back to the table and appeared to be passing out clothing to\nthe Youths on the pod.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• DMC University Laboratories report for Youth A, dated\n12/26/2023, Youth A tested positive for cannabinoids on\n12/26/2023.\n• Incident report dated 12/28/2024, report for Youth A’s drug\nscreen completed on 12/26/2024; positive cannabinoids.\n• Staff 1 does not have disciplinary action in her personnel file.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted there is insufficient evidence that\nstaff provided youth with a vape pen. Youth A initially reported a\nfemale staff gave him the vape pen, but when interviewed he\nreported it was a male staff. Youth A refused to provide the male\nstaff’s name.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
