Staff 1 reported Youth A broke a\nwindow and opened the door to a staff’s vehicle and was\nattempting to get in the vehicle when Youth A was placed in a\nrestraint.

Staff 1 stated Youth A left the building, Staff 1\ncontinued to follow Youth A but when Youth A got past the gym\nStaff 1 placed Youth A into a restraint due to being concerned with\nwhere or what Youth A was going to do.
