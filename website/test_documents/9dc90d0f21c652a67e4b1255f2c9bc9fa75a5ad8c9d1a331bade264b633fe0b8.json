DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nCCI Rule 400.4153 Shelter care and detention institutions; preliminary\nservice plans\n• (1) Within 7 calendar days of admission, a\nplan shall be developed for each resident. The\nplan shall include all of the following:\n• (b) An assessment of the resident's\nimmediate and specific needs.\nOne out of six preliminary plans reviewed did not assess the immediate needs of\nthe youth. Based on the intake, the youth was placed on a safety plan due to self-\nharming behaviors. The preliminary plan did not note this as an immediate need.\n2",

Although all youth need the same\nservices (food, shelter, clothing, medical), this form is to be client-centered and\nspeak specifically to the youth's immediate needs. Violation was found in a\nyouth's file due to not noting in the preliminary report the self-harming behaviors\nseen at intake. Supervisors are to ensure \"cutting and pasting\" are not occurring\nin reports and should be looking at intake documents as well as initial behaviors of\nthe youth to determine the immediate needs before signing off on reports. The\nagency will want to retrain supervisors and staff on writing and approving reports.\nV.
