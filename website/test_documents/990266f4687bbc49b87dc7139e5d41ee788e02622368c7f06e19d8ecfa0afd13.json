RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n11/08/2023\n_________________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 9, 2023\n____________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
