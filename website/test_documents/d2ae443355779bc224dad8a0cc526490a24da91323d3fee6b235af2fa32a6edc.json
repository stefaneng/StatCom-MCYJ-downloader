    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12417 Foster Parent Information\nSection (1) An agency shall provide a foster parent with all of the following\nDescription information before the placement or replacement of a child:\n(h) Any other known information to enable the foster parent to\nprovide a stable, safe, and healthy environment for the foster child\nand the foster family, including information about siblings who do\nnot reside in the foster home.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not provide foster parent with information about child\nprior to placement.\nInvestigation On 6/12/23 it was reported to DCWL that the agency did not\nprovide Foster Parent with important information about Youth A\nprior to placement. Specifically, the foster parent was not informed\nYouth A was involved in multiple investigations, including one\ncase where Youth A was possibly involved in the rape of another\nfoster child. In addition, Youth A completed a trauma assessment,\nwhich recommended he should not be placed with other children.\nAs this information was not provided to the foster parent, the youth\nwas placed in a home with other children and shared a bedroom\nwith another youth since January 2023. Reportedly, the foster\nhome is a borrowed bed from another agency. Licensing Worker 1\nand Foster Parent indicated they had no knowledge of this youth’s\nhistory when the Borrowed Bed Agreement began. Foster Parent\nexpressed concern to Complainant about not having this\ninformation, as she has used respite care with Youth A, in a home\nwith younger children. Had Foster Parent known this history, she\nwould have made alternative arrangements. Complainant\nindicated a Family Team Meeting (FTM) occurred recently to\ndiscuss Youth A’s school concerns. During the FTM no one from\nthe agency mentioned any safety concerns. However, after the\nmeeting, the trauma assessment report was reviewed and indicate\nYouth A may not be safe in a home with any other children. The\nagency knew this information prior to the meeting but did not\ndiscuss it with the team.\nComplainant was contacted via email on 6/13/23. Complainant\nindicated they did not have a copy of the Trauma Assessment.\nHowever, they provided contact information for those involved in\nthe case.\nOn 6/13/23 an attempt was made to contact Chief\nAdministrator by phone. A follow-up email was sent regarding\n2",
    "the allegation and investigation. On 6/13/23 Chief Administrator\nresponded and provided contact information for Program\nManager, Foster Care Supervisor, and Foster Care Worker 1.\nDHHS Monitor was contacted via email on 6/13/23 regarding\nthe trauma assessment. DHHS Monitor stated they had\nreviewed the trauma assessment and did not recall seeing a\nrecommendation not place Youth A with other children. DHHS\nMonitor reported being aware of the incident Complainant alluded\nto regarding rape. DHHS Monitor stated there was an allegation\npreviously, but it was dropped. DHHS Monitor could not recall any\ndetails, as they were not directly involved in the case. It was noted\nthere was no information about this in MiSACWIS, likely because\nthe allegation was dismissed. DHHS Monitor also did not recall\nany other incidents of inappropriate sexual behavior by Youth A in\nany foster homes.\nLicensing Supervisor was interviewed by video conference\non 6/13/23. Licensing Supervisor is employed by the agency that\nloaned the current foster home to Catholic Charities for the\nplacement of Youth A. Licensing Supervisor was not directly\ninvolved with placement, as Licensing Worker 2 was assigned to\nthe home at that time. Licensing Supervisor indicated that they\nstrive to be as open and honest with foster parents as possible. It\nis in their agency’s best interest to do so, as it helps them assist\nthe foster parents and maintain placements. Regarding the\nallegation, their agency was not informed by Catholic Charities\nthat Youth A had a history of sexually acting out, or a trauma\nassessment that recommended placements without other children.\nHowever, Licensing Supervisor indicated Licensing Worker 1\nwould have more knowledge.\nLicensing Worker 1 was interviewed by video conference on\n6/13/23. Licensing Worker 1 is assigned to the foster parent who\ncurrently has placement of Youth A. Licensing Worker 1\nacknowledged the placement request did not have much\ninformation on it. However, Licensing Worker 1 indicated she was\nnot assigned to the home or part of this placement in January\n2023. Licensing Worker 1 provided contact information for the\npreviously assigned person, Licensing Worker 2. Licensing\nWorker 1 stated she had some emails between Licensing Worker\n2 and Foster Care Worker 2 from Catholic Charities, which had\nmore details about the information provided to their agency and\nFoster Parent before the borrowed bed agreement began. Foster\nParent asked Foster Care Worker 2 several questions prior to\nplacement. Since placement, Foster Parent has had frequent\n3",
    "contact with Youth A’s Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA).\nLicensing Worker 1 also has a safety plan in place with Foster\nParent currently, due to the allegations in this investigation.\nLicensing Worker 2 was interviewed via Teams on 6/14/23.\nLicensing Worker 2 assisted with placement of Youth A into his\ncurrent foster home, as a borrowed bed placement. Licensing\nWorker 2 confirmed she emailed with Foster Parent and Foster\nCare Worker 2 from Catholic Charities about the placement at the\ntime. Foster Parent had a lot of questions, as it was understood\nthat Youth A would be sharing a bedroom with another, older,\nyouth. Regarding the current allegation, Licensing Worker 2 stated\nFoster Parent would not have accepted placement if they had any\nknowledge of sexual behavior. At the time of placement there was\nnot any sort of sexual behaviors disclosed for Youth A.\nLicensing Worker 3 was contacted by email on 6/13/23.\nLicensing Worker 3 is from another agency, which previously\nloaned a home to Catholic Charities for placement of Youth A from\n6/14/21- 9/2/21. An allegation on 6/16/21 indicated some\nsexualized behavior between Youth A and another youth in that\nfoster home. Children’s Services declined to investigate, the\nagency did not complete a special evaluation and it appeared law\nenforcement was not involved. As there was little information on\nfile, Licensing Worker 3 was asked if she had any knowledge\nabout the incident. Licensing Worker 3 stated she could not recall\nwhat the specific allegation was. However, the agency did not\ninvestigate as there was not a rule violation alleged.\nCASA was interviewed by phone on 6/15/23. CASA reported\nbeing involved with the case since July 2022. When asked about\nknowledge of any sexual incidents regarding Youth A and another\nfoster child, CASA reported being informed of some incidents in\nthe past, but not having specific information. On 1/11/23 CASA\nspoke with Foster Parent, who seemed to not know about these\nincidents. CASA was informed DCWL was unable to locate\ndocumentation to verify these sexual incidents occurred. CASA\nstated they were aware of an incident between Youth A and\nanother child in a foster home sometime between August and\nDecember 2021. However, they did not know of any detail other\nthan an investigation determined the allegations were unfounded\nand there were no charges. CASA reported they did not have any\ndocumentation regarding this. CASA denied discussing this with\nthe Foster Parent but encouraged the agency to disclose the\ninformation. Regarding the trauma assessment, CASA stated they\nwere aware the report did not specifically indicate Youth A should\n4",
    "not be placed with other children. However, CASA believed that\nrecommendation was made in a safety plan from the 2021\ninvestigation. There was no documentation available to verify this.\nFoster Care Supervisor was scheduled for a video conference\ninterview on 6/20/23. The interview was confirmed on 6/14/23.\nHowever, Foster Care Supervisor resigned her position prior to\nthe interview and did not wish to reschedule.\nProgram Manager was interviewed on 6/21/23 via video\nconference. Program Manager reported the previous foster care\nworker (Foster Care Worker 2), who participated in placement of\nYouth A, is currently on a medical leave and unavailable. Program\nManager admitted she did not have much first-hand knowledge of\nthe placement. However, she recalled speaking with Foster Care\nSupervisor about the trauma assessment. The assessment was\ncompleted as the agency was considering placing Youth A with\nfictive-kin and felt therapy would be helpful with that relationship.\nHowever, the fictive-kin placement fell through as they were not\nan appropriate caregiver. A placement request form was sent\nstate-wide. Licensing Worker 2 reached out with a potentially\ninterested foster parent. Licensing Worker 2, Foster Parent, and\nFoster Care Worker 2 emailed some questions back and forth\nprior to accepting placement. Regarding the indication that Youth\nA was accused of rape, Program Manager stated that it was her\nunderstanding the case was investigated and had no findings.\nHowever, she was not involved in the investigation and did not\nhave documentation. The Program Manager stated that in the\nagency’s opinion, as the matter was unsubstantiated, there was\nnot anything to tell a potential foster parent. There was not any\nother information available to the agency that Youth A had been\nsexually inappropriate. In addition, the trauma assessment did not\nrecommend that Youth A should not be placed with other children.\nTherefore, the agency believed unfounded allegations were not\nrequired to be shared with potential placement providers. Program\nManager stated if they were aware of a recommendation not to\nplace with other children, or any substantiated incidents of sexual\nbehavior, they would have shared the information and tried to\nsafety plan around it. Program Manager noted there were some\nconcerns with the accuracy of the trauma assessment as Youth A\ntold Foster Care Worker 2, he lied several times during the\nassessment. This is a typical behavior for Youth A, as he is angry\nwith the system and attempting to sabotage things. Which could\nalso be a reason for him to provide misinformation to Foster\nParent. However, Foster Parent continues to advocate for him and\nwork with the agency to maintain placement.\n5",
    "Foster Care Worker 1 was interviewed by phone on 6/27/23.\nYouth A was not assigned to this worker when placement\noccurred. Youth A has been assigned to this worker since April\n2023. Foster Care Worker 1 stated they were not aware of any\nsexual behavior or allegations against Youth A. It was noted on\nthe trauma assessment that Youth A had some history, but when\nFoster Care Supervisor was asked about it, she stated it was an\nincident of truth or dare between Youth A and another foster child.\nThere were no findings from that incident. Foster Care Worker 1\ndid not recall seeing a recommendation in the trauma assessment\nregarding placement with other children. Currently Youth A is\ndoing well in the home, although he can be anti-social at times.\nFoster Parent is very involved and engaged. Foster Parent cares\nvery much about the kids in her home and does a great job getting\nthem into the right services. Foster Parent calls Foster Care\nWorker 1 on a regular basis and informs the agency of any issues\nthat come up. There have been no concerns about sexually\ninappropriate behavior by Youth A in his current foster home.\nDocuments reviewed:\nOn 6/12/23 Youth A’s case file was reviewed in MISACWIS:\n• Youth A moved to current foster home on 1/5/23.\nPlacement outline from 1/5/23 did not identify any\nimmediate concerns, need for increased supervision, or\nbehavior plan.\n• Youth A was placed in a home from 1/7/22 to 4/22/22. No\nallegations or special evaluations occurred.\n• Youth A was placed in a home from 8/2/21-1/7/22. One\nspecial evaluation was initiated on 12/28/21. It was alleged\nYouth A touched another child while sharing a bedroom.\nDuring the special evaluation the child reported that Youth\nA did not touch him. The child stated two other children had\ntouched him in the past. The foster parent stated that the\nchild was known to bring up things from the past and speak\nabout them as if they were currently happening. No\nviolations were found. Children’s Services and Law\nEnforcement did not investigate.\n• Youth A was placed in a home 6/14/21-9/2/21. No special\nevaluations were on file. However, there was a DHHS\nintake from 6/16/21, which stated Youth A made sexually\ninappropriate comments to another foster child. A safety\nplan was implemented. Neither DHHS, Law Enforcement,\nnor the agency investigated the allegation.\n• Youth A was placed in a home from 5/17/21-6/14/21. No\nspecial evaluations were on file. However, there was an\n6",
    "intake with DHHS on 5/22/21 which stated Youth A was at\na respite placement where he (age 12) and a female youth\n(age 16) touched one another in a sexual way. DHHS did\nnot investigate. The agency did not complete a special\nevaluation as the respite caregiver was unlicensed. The\nmatter was referred to Law Enforcement, but reportedly\nwas closed with no findings.\n• Children’s Trauma Assessment Center report dated\n7/14/22 indicated the following:\n▪ Youth A displayed signs of trauma which\nincluded sexual behaviors not typical for age.\nHowever, this was not further explained.\n▪ Recommendations did not state youth should\nnot be placed with other children.\nEmails from December 2022 between Licensing Worker 2, Foster\nCare Worker 2, and Foster Parent were reviewed. In summary,\nFoster Parent was notified of several needs and behaviors of\nYouth A. There was no discussion of a history of sexualized\nbehavior. Foster Parent was provided with the phone number for\nYouth A’s foster parent at the time. It is unknown what they\ndiscussed. However, Foster Parent agreed to placement after they\nspoke.\nAnalysis Based on interviews completed and documents reviewed, there is\ninsufficient evidence to support the allegation. Contrary to what\nComplainant reported, the trauma assessment for Youth A did not\nmake a recommendation that he should be placed without other\nchildren. In addition, although there were three incidents where\nYouth A allegedly displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, none\nof the incidents were substantiated. In fact, one incident was\ninvestigated and found to be untrue. One incident was a verbal\nremark that was allegedly made and an investigation was\ndetermined to be unnecessary. The third allegation was reviewed\nby law enforcement and dismissed. The agency indicated they felt\nit was wrong to label Youth A as someone with sexualized\nbehaviors when there was no evidence to support this. It was\nnoted that licensing rules do not require agencies to report all prior\nunsubstantiated allegations to potential foster parents.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n7",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n_ _______________June 30, 2023______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 30, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
