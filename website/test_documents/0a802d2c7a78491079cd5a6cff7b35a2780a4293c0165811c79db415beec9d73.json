They threatened to kill\nthe youth with the knife. A staff member intervened.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 12/17/24.\nComplainant reported Youth B came into his office on 12/9/24 and\nexpressed concerns for her safety because Youth A threatened to\nstab her with pencils, pens and knives. Complainant reported\nYouth B told him Youth A has choked her before, but stated the\nfights were mutual between them. Complainant reported he called\nand spoke to Chief Administrator (CA) to make her aware of the\nconcerns, and request she take appropriate action to ensure their\nsafety. Complainant reported on 12/10/24, Youth B came into his\noffice and stated Youth A tried to stab her with a knife that\nmorning at breakfast. Youth B told Complainant he had a butcher\nknife, stood in the kitchen window and made a motion towards her\nwith the knife, but didn’t say anything. Youth B reported she was\nterrified and ran off. Complainant reported he spoke to CA in the\nafternoon, and CA told him there was a misunderstanding\nbecause Youth A was only messing around. Complainant reported\nhe spoke to Staff 1 on 12/11/24 to get her side of the story, and he\nalso watched the video. Complainant reported he was told it was a\nsteak knife, but then was told it was a butter knife. Complainant\nreported he spoke with Youth A, who admitted it was a steak\nknife. Complainant reported he was still unclear how Youth A\nended up with access to a knife in the first place.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n12/16/24. Youth A reported he had found a steak knife left on the\ndish rack by the sink and was trying to show Staff 3 what he\nfound. Youth A reported he was in the kitchen and Staff 3 was\nsitting at the table in the dining room. Youth A reported he said\n“[Staff 3] look” and she responded “no”. Youth A reported he said\n“[Staff 3] this is serious. Look, for real”, but Staff 3 still wouldn’t\nlook at him. Youth A reported Staff 3 came out of the office and\nasked where he got the knife from. Youth A told Staff 3 it was in\n2",
    "the dish rack like someone had just used it and washed it. Youth A\nreported the knife still had the guard on it while he was holding it.\nYouth A reported Youth B came by the kitchen window, and he\nshowed Youth B the knife. Youth A reported Youth B took it as he\nwas threatening her, but that wasn’t his intention at all. Youth A\nreported he didn’t find out until a day, or two later Youth B told the\npolice something other than what happened. Youth A reported the\npolice met with him at school to ask him about the situation, and\nYouth A reported he apologized to Youth B later that day. Youth A\nreported at the time of the incident, Youth B didn’t show any fear\nor say anything to show Youth A did anything wrong, so he was\nconfused when the police talked to him about the situation. Youth\nA reported the knives are supposed to be locked in a lock box in\nthe pantry, and the lock box was still located in the pantry at the\ntime he found the knife on the dish rack.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n12/16/24. Youth B reported she went towards the kitchen to get\nbreakfast but stopped in the dining room. Youth B reported Youth\nA was in the kitchen with a knife in his hand. Youth B reported\nYouth A had the knife in his hand and walked towards the kitchen\nwindow separating the kitchen and dining room. Youth B reported\nthe knife had a cover on it, and Youth A was sliding the cover up\nand down on the knife as he walked towards her. Youth B\nreported Youth A didn’t verbally or physically threaten her. Youth\nB reported Staff 1 put her hand out and stopped Youth A from\nwalking forwards anymore. Youth B reported Staff 1 said, “stop\n[Youth A]” and asked him to give her the knife. Youth B reported\nshe didn’t know how Youth A got a knife, and she doesn’t know\nwhere the knives are normally kept. Youth B reported she only\nremembered Staff 1 being around and doesn’t remember Staff 2\nor Staff 3 being involved. Youth B reported a couple days prior to\nthis, Youth A told her he would slit her throat and watch her die,\nbut there were no staff around to hear him say it.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 12/16/24.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A was in the kitchen, and she heard he\nkept calling Staff 3’s name, so she went to see what was going on.\nStaff 1 reported when she got into the kitchen, she noticed Youth\nA had a knife in his hand and was waving it in the air. Staff 1 told\nYouth A, “We need to get that. You’re not supposed to have that”.\nYouth B came over by the kitchen window when Youth A was\nwaving the knife around. Staff 1 reported it took her prompting\nYouth A approximately 4 times before Youth A complied with the\nrequest and returned the knife. Staff 1 reported she never once\nfelt threatened by him, felt that he threatened Youth B, and she\n3",
    "did not feel he was in any danger of harming anyone. Staff 1\nreported when Youth B ran away from the area, it was because\nshe was called to get her medications, not because she was\nfearful of the situation. Staff 1 reported while Youth A was holding\nthe knife, he didn’t make any jokes, threats, and did not wave the\nknife at anyone specifically. Staff 1 reported Youth A never\nthreatened Youth B, and Staff 1 was between both youth the\nentire time Youth A had the knife. Staff 1 reported she wasn’t sure\nhow he got the knife because she had recently arrived for her shift\nand hadn’t touched any knives or been in the kitchen yet that\nmorning. Staff 1 reported the policy is staff are supposed to count\nthem and make sure they’re all present at the end of their shift.\nStaff 1 reported when she went into the pantry where they keep\nthe knife lock box, the lock box was open. Staff 1 reported the\nknife lock box is always supposed to be locked. Staff 1 reported\nthe door to the pantry was broken from the previous day due to\nanother youth’s behaviors. Staff 1 reported she wasn’t sure if he\nobtained the knife from going into the pantry or if the knife was left\nout by accident.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 12/17/24. Staff 2 reported\nshe called Youth A over to get his medications, and then told him\nto go eat breakfast. Shortly after Youth A went to the kitchen, Staff\n2 heard Youth A calling for Staff 3 and Staff 1 repeatedly. Staff 2\nlooked at the kitchen area and saw Youth A holding up a knife.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A said, “you guys, a knife is out”. Staff 2\nreported she let Staff 1 and Staff 3 handle the knife situation with\nYouth A while she gave the other youth, including Youth B, their\nmedications. Staff 2 reported she didn’t see what happened in the\nkitchen, but she didn’t have any reason to believe Youth A was\nbeing threatening with the knife as there were no distressing\nnoises, escalated voices or movement, etc. Staff 2 admitted it was\nher fault because she left the knife out after cutting her food up on\nthird shift. Staff 2 reported she washed it and put it in the drying\nrack by the sink. Staff 2 reported she normally puts the knives\naway right away, but she forgot to that night. Staff 2 reported the\nknives are normally locked in a lockbox in the pantry, but she left\nthe lockbox unlocked and open in the pantry because she was\nwaiting to shut it until she put the knife away. Staff 2 reported the\nknife normally has a cover and the cover was sitting by the knife\ndrying as well. Staff 2 reported had she heard something cluing\nher in that there was a more serious issue happening, she would\nhave assisted. Staff 2 reported Youth B likes to instigate things\nand make up stories. Staff 2 reported one time she was\ntransporting Youth A and Youth B, and the car ride was fine.\n4",
    "However, later, Youth B reported Youth A beat her up in the car,\nwhich wasn’t true.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 12/17/24. Staff 3 reported\nshe was at the table watching down the bedroom hallway because\nthere were youth in their bedrooms. Staff 3 reported Youth A went\ninto the kitchen and kept calling Staff 3’s name. Staff 3 reported\nshe didn’t want to look at him because she was upset with him.\nStaff 3 reported when she finally looked over, Youth B was in the\nkitchen and had a knife in his hand. Staff 3 reported Staff 2 was\nusing the knife earlier and must have forgotten to put it away. Staff\n3 reported Youth A clinked Staff 2’s pan with the knife. Staff 3\nreported Youth B went to the kitchen to get breakfast. Staff 3\nreported she couldn’t see what happened, but from what she\nheard, Staff 1 was keeping Youth A away from Youth B because\nshe was saying “[Youth A] back up” or “stay away”. Staff 3 heard\nStaff 1 redirecting Youth A but didn’t know what happened or why\nhe was being redirected.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo from 12/10/24 was reviewed. The only camera angle that\nwas reviewed was in the dining room area facing the window\nlooking into the kitchen. There is no camera located in the kitchen\nso no other angles could be viewed. Youth B approaches the\nwindow in between the kitchen and dining room. Staff 1 can be\nseen in the kitchen by the window. Youth B leans on the kitchen\nwindowsill. Youth A makes a move towards the window, but it’s\nnot clear what he does or what object he’s holding. Staff 1 puts\nher arm out to block Youth A. Youth B steps back from the\nwindow. Youth B stands there for a few seconds, and then run\ntowards the location of the medication room.\nTOUR OBSERVATION:\nA tour of the facility occurred on 12/16/24. The pantry door where\nthe knife lock box is kept in was viewed to be in working order.\nThe knife box was in the pantry and was locked. There was a note\non the top of the knife box listing the contents of the box. Pictures\nwere taken.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Email sent to staff from CA on 12/12/24 regarding sharps\nas well as Youth A and Youth B’s safety plans. Youth A and\nYouth B are not to ride in the same vehicle together unless\nnecessary and approved by CA. Staff must sweep Youth\nB’s room every day and notify CA and Supervisor\nimmediately if any sharps are found on his person or in his\n5",
    "room. Limit Youth B’s interactions with Youth A to only what\nis necessary. When they are in the same room, a staff must\nbe present.\n• Incident report dated 12/10/24 authored by Staff 1. The\nincident report is consistent with Staff 1’s interview except\nthe incident report notes Youth A tried to grab another knife\nout of the pantry after Staff 1 took the first knife.\n• Resident Handbook pg. 2 states all kitchen utensils are to\nbe in their proper storage place, under staff supervision, to\nprepare meals.\n• Staff 2 does not have any disciplinary records in her\nemployee file. Signature pages for the Group Home Manual\nand Employee Handbook signed by Staff 2 on 10/11/23\nacknowledge she received, read and would abide by them.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as per interviews\nconducted, Staff 2 left a knife out, which was accessible to youth.\nStaff 2 admitted to leaving the knife out on the counter drying\ninstead of locking it up after use, and admitted she also left the\nknife lock box unlocked despite the pantry door being broken,\nwhich also left those knives accessible to youth.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility should make their policy clearer regarding\nexpectations for sharps (i.e. locked in lock box, lock box locked in\nlocked pantry, sharps checked and logged at the end of each shift,\netc.).\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR #2024SIC0001478 dated 7/17/24; CAP approved 8/2/24\nSIR #2023C0000500 dated 9/2/23; CAP approved 8/14/23\nSIR #2023C0000532 dated 7/6/23; CAP approved 8/16/23\n6",

The investigation substantiated a violation of staffing rules due to insufficient supervision and failure to secure dangerous items, as a staff member admitted leaving the knife out and the lockbox unlocked. This was a repeat violation, indicating systemic failures in safety protocols. The facility and the admitting staff member bear clear responsibility for creating the hazardous situation.",
