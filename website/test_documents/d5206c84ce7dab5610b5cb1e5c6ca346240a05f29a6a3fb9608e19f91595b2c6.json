Youth A broke off part of the\ncabinet to self-harm with, but staff were able to get the pieces away\nfrom her without physical restraint. Nurse was able to look at the cuts\nand clean them up without requiring stitches. Therapist reported\nYouth A does not have any supplemental safety plan and just had\nincreased checks added due to her head banging earlier that day.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on June 18,\n2024, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported\nearly on June 16, 2024, she was put into a restraint due to banging\nher head to harm herself. She reported she was upset because\nYouth C was in the hospital and believed it was her fault because\nthey were playing gymnastics and Youth C hurt her head. Youth A\nreported later that day she was still thinking about Youth C, so she\nstarted to pace around the milieu to look for something to harm\nherself with. She reported she remembered Staff 2 being present but\ndoes not fully remember Staff 1 being there. Youth A reported later in\nthe interview she remembered Staff 1 sitting in the green chair in the\nmilieu not doing anything. She reported Staff 2 followed Youth A\naround the milieu and kept telling her to stop her behavior. Youth A\nreported she broke off a piece of the counter and started to cut her\nforearm. She reported she remembered the TV on the unit was\nmoved because she was going to harm herself with the cord but\ndoes not remember who moved the TV. Youth A reported she\nremembered Staff 2 calling for additional support. She reported she\ndoes not remember Staff 1 saying anything to her and does not\nbelieve Youth B was in the milieu at the time. Youth A reported she\ntold Staff 1 to get away from her but that was after the restraint\noccurred earlier that day. She reported she felt Staff 1 was not\nsupportive during the situation because she was just sitting in the\ngreen chair.

Staff 1 reported she\nhas been working at the facility for three months. She reported she\ndoes not work much on Youth A’s unit because Youth C reported\nStaff 1 reminds her of a former staff from another facility that caused\nher trauma. On June 16, 2024, she was working on Youth A’s unit\nand was involved in the restraint earlier that day due to Youth A's\nhead banging. Staff 1 reported she was only involved with switching\nout with another staff and Youth A did not say anything to her. Later\nthat evening, Staff 1 completed a room check and Youth A was\nplaying in her room. She stated less than five minutes later, Youth A\n3",
    "came out of her room and continued to pace around the milieu.\nDuring this time, Youth B was playing video games and Staff 2 was\nin charge of checks. She reported Staff 2 gave Staff 1 the checks to\ncomplete so she could do the de-escalation with Youth A.

She reported that\nno one responded to the call since that unit was outside. Staff 1\nreported Staff 2 continued to verbally de-escalate Youth A and she\ncontinued to pick at the counter to get a piece to self-harm. Staff 1\nreported the only thing she told Youth A was, “You do not want to\nadd property destruction to your reflection sheet.” Youth A told Staff 1\nto shut up. Staff 1 reported within training she was taught if a youth\ndoes not respond to the first redirection, to let her be. She reported\nshe was also trained within behavior management training that one\nstaff should only be speaking to the youth that is escalated, so that is\nwhy Staff 1 let Staff 2 take that role. Staff 1 reported she sat next to\nYouth B while he continued to play his video games. She reported\nshe attempted to get Youth B to leave the area, but he refused and\nwanted to continue to play his game. Staff 1 reported when Youth A\nbegan to cut herself with the piece of the counter, Staff 2 made a call\nfor a show of support, and Staff 1 moved the TV since Youth A was\nlooking for more items to harm herself with. Staff 1 reported she\ncontinued to sit down next to Youth B when Nurse and Staff 3\nshowed up for support. She reported the whole situation lasted less\nthan ten minutes. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was doing a good job with\ntrying to redirect Youth A. She reported the only thing that should\nhave been done differently was a show of support should have been\ncalled quicker, as they waited a few minutes for the other unit to get\nback to them. Staff 1 reported she also thought about how she\nshould have not sat down with Youth B when Staff 3 and Nurse\nshowed up because it looked like she was not doing anything. She\nreported she was trying to verbally de-escalate but Youth A told her\nto shut up and she helped clear out the area. Staff 1 reported she\nwas trying to maintain support for Youth B.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on June 18, 2024, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported she had been\nworking at the facility for one month. She reported on June 16, 2024,\nYouth A had been struggling with self-harm. Staff 2 reported she told\nStaff 1 to complete a check on Youth A and then Youth A came out\nof her room. She reported Youth A started to pace in the milieu and\ntried to break things off the wall and counter to self-harm. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 attempted to redirect Youth A but Youth A told Staff\n1 to shut up. She reported she heard Staff 1 say to Youth A, “You\ndon’t want to add property destruction to your list.” This made Youth\nA more frustrated, and Staff 1 then sat down in a chair. Staff 2 told\nStaff 1 to call over the walkie-talkie to the other unit to get support,\nwhich she did. They waited five minutes, but no one responded, and\n4",
    "Youth A continued to try to harm herself. She reported they started to\nclear off the unit and Youth A continued to pace around. Staff 2\nreported she told Staff 1 that a show of support needed to be called\nbut Staff 1 did not get up from her chair to make the call, so Staff 2\nfollowed through with that action. She reported when came back,\nStaff 1 had moved the TV off the unit but that was all she did. Staff 2\nreported Youth B was on the unit and Staff 1 was sitting next to him.\nShe reported she does not know if Staff 1 asked Youth B to go to his\nroom, but she should have done that. Staff 2 reported Staff 3 and\nNurse showed up for support to help Youth A calm down. She\nreported she was frustrated with Staff 1 because she did not get up\nto make the phone call for the show of support and does not believe\nshe asked Youth B to go to his room. Staff 2 reported if Youth B had\ngone to his room, then she could have had support from Staff 1 to\nhelp with Youth A.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on June 18,\n2024, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker.

She reported she focused on Youth A to process the\nsituation and redirected her question by asking her why she was\nhurting herself. Supervisor reported she was able to verbally de-\nescalate Youth A. She reported Staff 1 did appear to have eyes on\nthe situation but was not interacting with Youth A when Supervisor\nwas present. Supervisor reported the only thing she would have\nchanged about the situation was to not have Staff 1 sitting down but\nhave her stand near Youth B as more of a shield in case Youth A\ncame after Youth B. She reported she did speak with Staff 1 after the\nincident deescalated and Staff 1 reported she did not engage with\nYouth A because Youth A told her to leave her alone and she did not\nwant to escalate Youth A more, so she allowed Staff 2 to take over\nthat de-escalation.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on July 8, 2024, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker.
