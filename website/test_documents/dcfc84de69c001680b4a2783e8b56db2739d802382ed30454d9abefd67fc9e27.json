INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nDescription suitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\n1",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff member spoke poorly about youth and inappropriately\nshared information. Staff member described youth as\npromiscuous, liar, and manipulative, etc.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed the Chief Administrator by telephone on 7/29/2024.\nThe Chief Administrator referred me to Program Manager as he\nwould be more familiar with the circumstances that were reported\nand the status of the outcome of the allegations.\nI interviewed Complainant by telephone on 7/29/2024.\nComplainant. Complainant stated she was informed of the\nallegations by the therapist of Youth A. Complainant clarified the\ninitial confusion regarding which Child Placing Agency was\nresponsible for the supervision of Youth A at the time of the\ncomplaint allegations. Complainant reported Guiding Harbor, the\ncurrent CPA, took over this program and services effective May 1,\n2024. Complainant provided contact information for the Program\nManager who would have additional information regarding the\nstatus of the allegations.\nI completed a telephone interview with Program Manager on\n9/9/2024. Program Manager stated Staff identified in the\nallegation had been disciplined with a suspension effective\n7/26/2024, following the report of the allegations. Program\nManager stated Staff's discipline included a suspension until\n8/08/2024. Program Manager stated Staff was disciplined for a\nviolation of the agency's confidentiality policy. On Monday\n07/22/2024, a case manager and Staff met with Youth A for a\nroutine meeting, where Staff spoke very inappropriately and in a\ndemeaning manner to Youth A. It crossed many professional and\nethical boundaries and had to be shut down. Staff described youth\nas promiscuous, liar, and manipulative, etc. Program Manager\nstated Staff was subsequently terminated when Staff did not\nreturn following the disciplinary suspension. The reported\ntermination date was 8/8/2024.\nI interviewed MDHHS Worker by telephone on 09/05/2024.\nMDHHS Worker reported she had completed her investigation\nwith no findings. MDHHS Worker provided a copy of her\ncompleted investigation.\nNo contact information was provided by MDHHS Worker or the\nagency for Staff to be reached.\n2",
    "Documentation Review:\nThe completed MDHHS Worker report indicated a safety plan had\nbeen implemented for Youth A and Staff's employment had been\nterminated.\nDocumentation from the agency Human Resources confirmed\nStaff last day worked was 7/24/2024 and Staff resigned 8/8/2024.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance as Staff was disciplined for\nviolating the agency's confidentiality policy and eventually\nterminated from employment with the agency. The determination\nof this violation substantiates Staff was not of responsible\ncharacter and suitable to meet the needs of Youth A. The agency\nresponded timely to the allegations and implemented appropriate\ndiscipline to establish compliance with the termination of Staff's\nemployment.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n10/04/2024\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/15/2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n3"
