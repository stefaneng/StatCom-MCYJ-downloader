CA reported no concerns have been brought\nto her attention regarding staff sleeping on shift or not completing\nbed checks as required. CA reported Staff 2 had never talked to\nher about staff sleeping on shift. CA reported Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere both terminated this week, so they anticipated a complaint\nwas going to be called in about something since it has been a\ntrend after employee terminations.\nLicensee Designee (LD) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 4/19/24. LD reported completing bed checks as\nrequired and not sleeping on shift have been topics discussed\nduring staff meetings over the last couple months due to the\ninvestigation at their other facility.

    "for. LD reported the only chair off camera is the one in the living\nroom on the main level located right under the camera. After\nwatching video footage from Staff 6’s shift between 3/16/24-\n3/17/24, LD reported the chair will be removed to ensure no staff\nsit there moving forward. LD noted this due to viewing Staff 6\nsitting in the chair and not moving around during the shift, but LD\nnot being able to discern whether he was sleeping or not.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/19/24.\nYouth A reported she has never seen any staff sleeping on shift.\nShe reported she knows staff do bed checks because she wakes\nup when they’re being done.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/19/24.\nYouth B reported she has never seen any third shift staff sleeping\non shift. She reported she saw Staff 4 sleeping on shift a couple\ntimes when Staff 4 first started, but it’s been a while. Youth B\nreported Staff 4 had two jobs, so if it wasn’t busy, she would nod\nher head like she was dozing off, but she would wake right back\nup. Youth B reported she has never complained to anyone about\nstaff sleeping on shift, so she’s not sure why anyone would say\nthat.

Staff 1 reported\nhe no longer works at the facility as he was terminated on 4/11/24.\nStaff 1 reported he knows Staff 3 is sleeping on shift because two\nweeks ago he came in on first shift and saw her sleeping in a chair\nin the second-floor hallway. Staff 1 reported when he went\nupstairs, Staff 3 was asleep, so he tapped her on the shoulder and\nStaff 3 said, “you just woke me up”. Staff 1 reported Staff 4 told\nhim she has seen Staff 3 sleeping on shift multiple times as well.\nStaff 1 reported he has never seen any other staff sleeping on\nshift, but Staff 6 has told him she’s upset because she works third\nshift and Staff 5 has been sleeping downstairs when they work\ntogether. Staff 1 stated he never reported this concern to anyone.\nWhen asked why he is bringing it up now, he said, “no reason”.\nStaff 1 then reported he told LD about his concern in a text\nmessage and stated he would send a screenshot as verification. It\nshould be noted, after multiple requests, a screenshot was never\nreceived.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 4/12/24. Staff 2 reported\nshe no longer works at the facility because she retired on 4/8/24.\nStaff 2 reported when she has come in to work for first shift, she\nhas witnessed Staff 3 just waking up. Staff 2 reported last month,\n3",
    "Staff 3 told her she had dozed off and was just waking up because\nshe had worked a double shift. Staff 2 reported all the youth were\nupset because Staff 3 didn’t wake them up timely. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 5 is covered with a blanket when she comes in but hasn’t\nwitnessed him sleeping. Staff 2 reported she told CA all this\ninformation about 3 weeks ago and CA responded they know who\nis sleeping or not sleeping because they watch the cameras.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/19/24.\nStaff 3 reported she typically works third shift and normally works\nwith Staff 8 but has also worked with Staff 5 and Staff 6. Staff 3\nadmitted she has dozed off before because third shift can be\nbrutal. Staff 3 reported she has closed her eyes but could not\nrecall if she’s slept during a shift. Staff 3 reported it’s possible she\ndozed off long enough to miss a bed check, but she was not\npositive. Staff 3 reported it’s been better since she and Staff 8\nbegan switching off every 3 hours who was doing bed checks and\nwho was doing other tasks. Staff 3 reported she doesn’t\nremember a time when Staff 1, Staff 2 or Staff 4 saw her sleeping\nor woke her up when they came in for first shift. Staff 3 reported\nshe worked a double shift in March 2024, but couldn’t remember if\nshe slept during the shift.

Staff 3 reported she has never\nseen Staff 5 or Staff 6 sleeping on shift.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 4/12/24.

Staff 4 reported she didn’t\nnotice anyone sleeping on shift while the special investigation\nregarding similar concerns was occurring at the other facility. Staff\n4 reported Staff 3 told her Administrator 1 was calling her and\ntexting her on shift making sure she was doing bed checks\nbecause Administrator 1 was watching the cameras. Staff 4\nreported Staff 3 began sleeping on shift again in March 2024. Staff\n4 reported Staff 3, Staff 5 and Staff 6 know where to sit and sleep\nso the cameras cannot see them. Staff 4 reported she assumes\nStaff 3, Staff 5 and Staff 6 are not completing bed checks as\nrequired since they’ve been sleeping on shift. Staff 4 reported she\nnever spoke to CA, LD, Administrator 1, or Administrator 2 about\nher concerns because Staff 3 is Administrator 1’s daughter.\n4",
    "Staff 5 was interviewed via phone on 4/26/24. Staff 5 reported\nuntil 3 weeks ago, he wasn’t allowed to complete bed checks\nbecause he was a male staff. Staff 5 reported when he worked, he\nwould make sure the house was clean, do chores, prepare meals\nfor the next day, and complete the communication log. Staff 5\nreported he typically gets his chores done first, and then sits in the\nliving room the remainder of the shift. Staff 5 reported he sits in\nthe chair under the camera in the living room because the plug by\nthe chair is the only one that works for his laptop charging box.\nStaff 5 reported he also likes sitting there because it’s directly in\nfront of the TV, which he watches during his shift. Staff 5 reported\nhe has a blanket over him while he’s sitting in the chair because\nthe house gets cold at night, even if he’s wearing warm clothing.\nStaff 5 reported he is not a phone person, which is why he’s not\non his phone and it's typically sitting next to him while he watches\nTV. Staff 5 reported when he first started working third shift at the\nfacility in August 2023, he would fall asleep or doze off while\nworking, but he got used to working third shift and it hasn’t been a\nproblem in a while. Staff 5 reported he knows he’s not supposed\nto sleep on shift, and he’s gotten into a good routine, so he hasn’t\nhad any issues falling asleep or dozing off on shift. Staff 5\nreported he hasn’t had any concerns about Staff 3 or Staff 6\nsleeping on shift.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via phone on 4/30/24. Staff 6 reported\nshe has never fallen asleep on shift and has never seen anyone\nelse sleeping on shift. Staff 6 reported she never talked to Staff 1\nabout concerns regarding Staff 5 sleeping on shift. Staff 6\nreported staff always try to keep each other awake by talking to\neach other or being on their phones. Staff 6 reported her phone\nalarms are loud, so she never misses a bed check. Staff 6\nreported last year, she was having trouble completing bed checks\nevery 15 minutes or less, but this year she hasn’t had any trouble\ncompleting bed checks as required.\nStaff 7 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/19/24.\nStaff 7 reported she works first shift, but she has worked third shift\na couple times.

    "main level doing other tasks. Staff 8 reported prior to that, she and\nStaff 3 would switch off different days who was upstairs doing bed\nchecks for an entire shift and who was completing other tasks on\nthe main level. Staff 8 reported since they are not on the same\nfloor together, she doesn’t know if Staff 3 has ever slept on shift,\nbut she has never seen her sleeping. Staff 8 reported she has\nnever seen Staff 5 or Staff 7 sleeping on shift either. Staff 8\nreported when she is working, she completes bed checks\nconsistently between 10–15 minute intervals.
