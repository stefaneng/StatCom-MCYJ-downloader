    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection (1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\nDescription contact with children or parents to be a person who has the ability,\nexperience, education, and training to perform the duties\nassigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation Agency staff member brought a youth to the hospital and reported\nthat youth continuously sexually assaulted the staff member\nthroughout the past week. This was reported to the employee's\nsupervisor and no known action was taken.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant:\nOn 8/28/2024 I interviewed Complainant by telephone.\nComplainant reported on 8/21/2024, Foster Care Worker (FCW) 1\nbrought Youth A to the hospital’s mental health unit for evaluation\nand FCW 1 was sent to the hospital’s Emergency Unit, as that\nwas more appropriate given Youth A’s situation at the time.\nComplainant reported concern related to her interaction with FCW\n1, birth mother, Youth A and a supervisor who had arrived with the\nbirth mother during the hospital’s interaction with FCW 1 and\nYouth A. Complainant said all parties were escalated, and she\ntalked to birth mother. She also observed bruises on Youth A’s\nneck which were reported as being caused by another youth, in\nthe foster home, whom Youth A had attacked. She reported while\nshe was speaking with FCW to explain the hospital would not do\nan inpatient admission of him at that time, FCW 1 began to cry\nand stated Youth A has sexually assaulted her repeatedly over the\nlast week. FCW 1 stated Youth A has also sexually assaulting his\nfoster parent. FCW 1 did not give details as to what that assault\nentailed or where the youth may have touched her or the foster\nparent. FCW 1 reported “they assign him to me every day”.\nComplainant said she questioned whether FCW 1 felt safe. She\nasked FCW 1 whether she had reported this matter to her\nsupervisor and asked who that person was. FCW 1 responded\nshe had reported the matter, and that she was told “We all have\nclients like this” that she has to deal with it. FCW 1 reported she\n2",
    "had not reported this matter to the police, but she would do so\ntoday. FCW 1 reported Youth A would return to his respite home\nfor later psychiatric follow up.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 1\nOn 9/9/2024 I interviewed FCW 1 by telephone. FCW 1 reported\nshe is new to child welfare and has only worked as a case worker\nat the agency for four months. She reported being assigned to\nYouth A’s case on 7/24/2024. It was transferred from the agency\nMuskegon office and there Youth A’s case was assigned to a\nmale staff. FCW 1 said ever since she has had Youth A’s case,\nYouth A (age 15) has displayed boundary issues. FCW 1\nreported, “He won’t stop hugging me, he has asked to hump me;\nhe has humped my car. He will hang on to me very tight”. She\nsaid he has also made sexual comments like “Do you want this\nfoot long now or later.” FCW 1 said Youth A did not make that\nstatement to her, but he has made it to other kids in the foster\nhome, along with telling one of them that they “have a fat ass”.\nShe said Youth A has behavioral and psychological issues, and\nhe likes seeing others react to his bad behavior.\nFCW 1 said she was told the agency did not know Youth A had\nthese sexualized behaviors when they accepted placement of him.\nShe said she only read about some of the behaviors after she had\nheld the case. She said the behaviors were not described to the\nintensity that he was displaying during his inactions with her and in\nthe foster homes. She said Youth A’s sexualized behavior with her\nhas been going on since 7/24/2024. She explained that on\n7/29/2024 she had to transport him to his mom for a visit and\nthough he did okay during the transport, he did not at the visit. He\ncame up and was touching and swirling her hair, and he would not\nstop when asked. If he did stop, he would begin again. This was\nthe first day he asked to hump her. He also asked to pick her up\nafter lifting up his mom and he hugged her and would not let go.\nFCW 1 admitted that Youth A never tried to touch her private parts\nthat day or during her time on the case, but that his sexualized\nbehaviors were escalating and getting worse. She explained a\nfoster parent asked for his removal after he kept acting out toward\nthe other children in the home, which on one occasion led to\nanother child attacking him. She said it was in Youth A’s respite\nhome where, Youth A had ultimately touched the Respite Foster\nMother’s breast on 8/21/2024 and pulled out a knife and\nthreatened to break the knife. That was also the day she\ntransported him to the emergency room for possible psychiatric\nadmission. She said that day his behavior was the worst, with him\n3",
    "running around, touching her hair, holding on to her body and\ntrying to mess with her car.\nFCW 1 reported it being overwhelming handling Youth A’s\nbehaviors and having to interact with him almost daily for the week\nin July 2024 and later in August 2024 when the agency was trying\nto get him hospitalized. She said on 7/29/2024, she called\nSupervisor due to Youth A’s inappropriate behavior towards her\nand her concern/uncomfortableness with Youth A. Supervisor told\nher the agency did not know about these behaviors for Youth A,\nbut FCW 1 reiterated that she later read that the agency not\nknowing about the behaviors for Youth A may not have been the\ncase. She said Supervisor told her to keep her aware of what was\nhappening on the case and with Youth A. Additionally that, if she\nneeded someone to go with her when she has to transport Youth\nA to ask for assistance. FCW 1 said she did know if she was\nperhaps overreacting about her feelings about the youth\nbehaviors. She said she questioned how could or even should she\nask someone else to assist her, or whether they could\naccommodate her, give that her co-workers are also busy and\nhave full caseloads. FCW reported it was her pride and desire to\nsuccess that caused her to push forward with handling Youth A’s\ncase. She said it was not until they were trying to get Youth A\nhospitalized, and she was later informing the police pertaining to\nYouth A’s behaviors toward her, that she realized she had been\nmaking excuses for Youth A. That she was never comfortable with\nYouth A. She said most times it was hard; and although\nsometimes other staff were able to accompany her with Youth A,\nmost times they could not. She reported wishing the agency had\nintervened on her behalf instead of just asking her to keep them\ninformed of what was going on. In retrospect she wishes the\nagency’s management had asked her if the situation was\nbecoming too much and if she was okay.\nFCW 1 did not report asking for Youth A’s case to be transferred\nfrom her caseload. She said she may have been uncomfortable\nasking to get this case reassigned, because she was new and she\nwanted to keep trying. Also, when FCW 1 was venting about the\ncase on 8/20/2024 CA 2 said, “you need to get over it, we all have\nhard cases.” Due to that statement FCW 1 thought she had no\nagency support and no choice but to deal with the situation.\nFCW 1 said she continued dealing with Youth A’s behaviors and\nhis case for three days straight from 8/19/2024 until 8/21/2024,\nwhich was the day before he was placed in a shelter. She told the\nagency she would not transport Youth A to his shelter placement\n4",
    "on 8/22/2024 and the agency was okay with that. She reported\nthereafter DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services)\ntook Youth A’s case back.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS).\nI interviewed FCS by telephone on 9/9/2024. FCS confirmed\ninformation reported by FCW 1 related to, when the agency\nreceived Youth A’s case, from where, behaviors he was\npresenting and presenting towards FCW 1, and those behaviors\nescalating on 8/19/2024. She also affirmed the reporting about\nYouth A acting out against a youth in his former foster home and\nbeing attacked by that youth due to Youth A’s behavior. She\nreported after FCW 1 first reported how Youth A behaved with her,\nhim being touchy feely with her at his/parent youth visitation she\ndid not want FCW 1 to be alone trying to supervise those\nvisitations. She reported since Youth A had done well during the\ntransports to the visitations, she sought to assist FCW 1 along the\nlines of the parenting visit site. She asked DHHS to use one of\ntheir visitation rooms where FCW 1 could monitor the visit by way\nof one-way mirror. She admitted that visit didn’t work, because\nYouth A kept leaving the room, locating FCW 1 and still trying to\nhug her or touch her hair. He also left the building and FCW 1 and\nhis mom had difficulty getting him back inside. FCS reported after\nthat visit, they sought to put protective protocols in place whereby\na co-worker was to be with FCW 1 to supervise the visit. The,\noriginal plan was for her and FCW 1 to transport Youth A. She\nreported that plan did not consistently work out due to scheduling\nconflicts for her and FCW 1’s coworkers, but DHHS agreed to\nhave a worker at the visit to help FCW 1 with supervision of the\nparent /youth visit. She said there was no incidents by Youth A at\nthat next parent/youth visit, but that did not continue for the\nfollowing visit. Thereafter the agency continued seeking to get\nYouth A mental health assistance.\nFCS said FCW 1 did report being uncomfortable with the situation\nwith Youth A. FCW 1 expressed more concern with Youth A’s\nmom. That the mom was not redirecting Youth A’s behaviors. She\nsaid FCW 1 never reported feeling unsafe with Youth A. FCS said\nshe would advise FCW 1 to redirect Youth A.\nFCS affirmed FCW 1’s reporting related to a further incident with\nYouth A at Respite Foster Mother’s (RFM) home involving a knife\nand Youth A acting out towards RFM on 8/21/2024 when FCW 1\nwas transporting him from the respite foster home back for his\nCMH appointment. FCS reported because of all that was going on\nthat day she sent FCW 2 to assist FCW 1, to try to help calm and\n5",
    "deescalate Youth A. She said that day she was coordinating with\nthe respite foster parent to file a police report. She also advised\nFCW 1 and FCW 2 to file a police report. The agency also safety\nplanned with the respite foster home afterwards.\nFCS reported feeling she did all that she could to help protect\nYouth A and to support FCW 1. She said she told FCW 1, she\nwould find someone else to transport Youth A if FCW 1 didn’t feel\ncomfortable and FCW 1 reported, ‘No, I will do it.” She said she\nalso told FCW 1 she would have Youth A’s case transferred, if\nFCW 1 didn’t feel comfortable, and FCW 1 reported she could\nhandle it. She denied ever telling FCW 1 “We all have hard jobs\nand to get over it” or being aware of anyone who had made such a\nstatement to FCW1. FCS denied FCW 1 ever told her someone\nhad made such a statement like that to her. FCS also denied FCW\n1 refusing to transport Youth A on 8/22/2024. FCS said FCW 1\nvolunteered to do so.\nRespite Foster Mother (RFM)\nOn 9/26/2024 I interviewed RFM by telephone. RFM had no\ndirect information related to what support the agency provided or\ndid not provide FCW 1. She was interviewed related to Youth A’s\nplacement with her, behaviors he presented and what she\nwitnessed of his interaction with FCW 1. She reported having\nYouth A in placement on a temporary basis for two days. She was\ntold there was an incident in Youth A’s prior foster home. That a\nyouth got upset with Youth A over something Youth A did. The\nyouth put hands around Youth A’s neck in retaliation and Youth A\nwas replaced. She affirmed Youth A having serious behavioral\nand psychiatric concerns. She reported FCW 1 coming to her\nhome to transport Youth A to an appointment in late August 2024,\nan incident happening whereby she observed FCW 1’s car horn\ngoing off. FCW 1 was on the phone with a coworker asking for\nassistance. FCW 1 said “he just choked me out” and FCW 1 told\nher to go back inside and lock the door. She said during that time\nYouth A came over and tried to put her in a headlock and FCW 1\ncame over and got Youth A. RFM said FCW 1’s coworker arrived\nabout 10 minutes later to assist her with Youth A. She said FCW\n1 was calm but shaking while handling the situation with Youth A.\nRFM said the only thing FCW 1 reported to her about Youth A\nactions with her was that he was a handful, that his aggression\ntoward her had been verbal in the past not physical. RFM said\nshe told FCW 1 that Youth A had grabbed a knife and was trying\nto get at her. He was licking his lips and tried to get on top of her,\nbut she got away from him. He was yelling and swearing, and this\n6",
    "behavior went on for about 15 minutes before he calmed down\nand FCW 1 arrived to transport him. She reported after Youth A\ndid not get admitted, the agency agreed Youth A would not be\nalone with her. They safety planned. She said Youth A tended to\nbehave this way just with females, that the behaviors he displayed\nnever came out with her husband.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 2\nI interviewed FCW 2 by telephone on 9/27/2024. FCW 2 reported\nbeing employed by the agency less than eight months. She\naffirmed information reported by FCW 1 related to Youth A being\ndifficult due to Youth A sexualized behaviors towards FCW 1.\nAdditionally, that FCW 1 complained about him. She said she and\nFCW 1 shared an office, and FCW 1 complained daily about\nYouth A’s verbal and physical harassment of her by calling her a\nhoe and slut and him constantly touching her hair or shoulders.\nFCW 2 reported hearing FCW 1 calling and telling Supervisor “He\nwon’t stop touching me, I don’t feel safe with him in my car”. FCW\n2 reported FCW 1 reported being scared. FCW 2 reported\nSupervisor’s response to FCW 1 was Supervisor telling FCW 1\nthings like “these things happen, you just have to stop him” that\nshe has “to tell him to stop, to step away from him”; but his\nbehaviors never stop. FCW 2 reported Supervisor appeared to\nmake it seem as if Youth A “was going to perp”, meaning to do\ninappropriate touching, no matter what, as opposed to respecting\nor protecting FCW 1. FCW 2 said one of their big bosses, Chief\nAdministrator 2 told FCW 1, “We all have these case, you just\nhave to smile through it.” She also reported Supervisor sending\nher to assist FCW 1 with Youth A at his respite foster home in late\nAugust 2024. FCW 2 said Youth A had only been at this home for\n24-hours and he was having an episode. She said Supervisor\nwas on the phone with FCW 1 and she heard FCW 1 telling Youth\nA to get off her, she didn’t want to be touched. Youth A was yelling\nat FCW 1. FCW 2 reported when she arrived at the respite home\nYouth A was verbally and physically acting out, calling her names,\ntrying to touch her body. She redirected him. She assisted in\ngetting him in the car, and they transferred him to his assessment.\nFCW 2 affirmed hearing that Youth A did better with males and\nindicated the agency had two male staff at the time. One in foster\ncare and one in independent living. She did not know if a transfer\nof Youth A’s case to one of those staff was ever a possibility. She\ndid not know whether FCW 1 ever asked to be removed from\nYouth A’s case or if the agency ever explored it.\nChief Administrator (CA) 2\n7",
    "I interviewed CA 2 on 10/23/204 by telephone. I also received an\nemail statement from her on 9/23/2024. CA 2 denied the agency\nnot seeking to aid FCW 1 related to handling Youth A’s case,\naround him allegedly sexually assaulting her. She denied making\nany statement to FCW 1 like she needs to get it over it, that we all\nhave hard cases, or to being aware of any person making such a\nremark of to FCW 1.\nCA 2 reported that at the time they accepted Youth A’s case, they\ndid not know the severity of Youth A’s mental health needs. If they\nhad they never would have accepted the case. She said at the\ntime they were serving the case they did not have a male staff to\nassign to his case. Nor did they have senior staff, all workers had\nsimilar seniority as FCW 1. She said after learning of Youth A's\nbehaviors, as reported by FCW 1, Supervisor was working with\nFCW 1 around those issues. They also knew that Youth A was\nslated to be placed in a residential placement in September 2024\nand they were trying to made it to that date. Supervisor was\nchecking in with FCW 1 regularly and providing assistance\nverbally and provided coworker assistance when needed and as\nable.\nCA 2 said Supervisor also had a conversation with FCW 1 about\ntransferring the case to another worker and FCW 1 wanted to stay\non the case. FCW 1 said she could handle it. CA 2 said they also\ntried to give Youth A’s case to DHHS before his ultimate late\nAugust 2024 case termination from the agency and DHHS would\nnot take the case back at that time. When Youth A went into a\nshelter on 8/22/2024 or 8/23/2024 DHHS agreed to take the case\nback.\nDocuments Reviewed\nYouth A’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• He entered care in 2019 and is a temporary court ward.\n• He was placed with Holy Cross Muskegon on 6/24/2024\nthen placed with this Holy Cross office on 7/24/2024.\n• He was placed in RFM’s foster home on 8/20/2024 until\n8/22/2024.\n• His diagnoses include disruptive mood deregulation\ndisorder, oppositional deficit disorder, attention deficit-\nhyperactivity disorder/ predominant hyperactive/impulsive\npresentation.\n• A copy of social work contacts from FCS showing\ninformation about Youth A’s behavior in his prior foster\nhome on 8/16/2024, as reported about that incident, and\n8",
    "onward to 8/21/2024 when Youth A was taken to the\nhospital and FCS went there to assist FCW 1.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and case information reviewed it is clear\nYouth A had mental health issues impacting his acting out\nbehaviors. The evidence also showed some assistance was\noffered FCW 1, in dealing with Youth A, on handling this difficult\ncase, but the degree of that assistance or its effectiveness, as well\nas, whether FCW 1 clearly communicated her needs/ comfortable\nlevel on this case, or the actual amount of support provided her is\nnot clear. Notwithstanding this, the evidence does not essentially\nshow the managerial staff did not demonstrate the ability,\nexperience, education, and training to perform the duties\nassigned.\nTechnical Assistance\nThe agency would be apprised to examine what happened related\nto this case and to establish guidelines and or training around how\nto better aid new and inexperienced workers in handling youths\nwith mental health concerns and severe boundary issues.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the agency’s current licensing status is recommended.\nNovember 22, 2024\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 27, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n9"
