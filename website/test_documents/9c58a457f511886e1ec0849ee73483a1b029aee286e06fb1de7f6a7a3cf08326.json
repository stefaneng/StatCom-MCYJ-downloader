Program Description\nThe Samaritas Jackson House is a program run by Samaritas Refugee in\nLansing. The facility will be utilized by male’s ages 16-17 who have been\ndeemed as refugees and are unaccompanied by an adult caretaker. The\nagency has been given a federal contract to provide services to these\nyouth. They are awaiting an approval of their license before the State of\nMichigan Department of Health and Human Services will issue them a\ncontract through Refugee Services.\nThe services the facility will provide are intended to assist refugee and\nimmigrant teens with acculturation and independent living preparation. It\nis set up to provide the residents with a “community-based, open living\nenvironment where male teens engage in skill building activities as part of\nthe daily milieu within a positive group of peers with similar goals.” The\nfacility intends to provide the youth with the skills needed to transition into\nindependent or semi-independent living once discharged from the facility.\nThe facility will provide the youth in its care with case management,\nhousing, counseling, independent living classes, acculturation and\ntransitional services. It will also provide family reunification services and\nassistance in maintaining contact, including visits, with family members.\nVolunteer mentors will be provided to help the youth meet their goals.\nThe facility will seek and coordinate with outside services to provide\neducational support, legal services, medical, and dental services.\nAll youth who wish to utilize the program must meet specific criteria set\nforth by the Office of Refugee Resettlement/Division of Children’s\nServices (ORR/DCS) and/or the Department of Human Services. Since\nThe Jackson House is funded by ORR/DCS all youth who participate\nmust be eligible. Some of those eligibility requirements as stated in the\nfacility’s Intake Procedures include mild behavior issues, minimal mental\nhealth issues, developmentally appropriate to prepare for independent\nliving as a next placement, not a risk for becoming absent from\nplacement, past substance use or experimentation with demonstration of\nabstinence or recovery behavior, and youth committed to learning\nindependent living skills.\n3",
    "c. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\nIV.
