The following examples were provided:\n Youth A has had 15-30 cavities since coming into care and has not had them treated\ntimely.\n Youth A and Youth B are overdue for eye exams.\n Staff have perjured themselves in court and fabricated incidents in order to keep the\ncase open.\n The children were in extremely dangerous situations where they were starved and\nabused mentally and physically by a foster parent and dangerous child in the home.\n The children’s former foster parent was an alcoholic.\n The agency did not allow the children to attend their sister’s high school graduation.\n Children’s Protective Services was not truthful from the beginning of the case.\n The agency has not provided therapy as court ordered.\n The agency has not completed monthly visits with the children.\n The agency lied in court about completing Family Team Meetings.\n The judge does not allow the children or their mother to talk in court\n The children’s Guardian Ad-Litem has never met the children or their mother.\n The agency intentionally causes emotional distress.\n3",
    "The complainant was informed that DCWL can only investigate matters that fall under\nDCWL licensing rules and a DHHS contract with the private agency. Matters involving the\ncourt, LGAL, and CPS are outside of the scope of DCWL. It was clarified for the\ncomplainant that this investigation would focus on the agency’s compliance with health care\n(including vision, dental and eye exams), therapy services, safety in the previous\nplacement, family team meetings, and foster home visits.\nALLEGATION:\nAgency has not followed through with dental and vision care as required.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 7/21/21 Parent 1 was contacted about the allegations and reported Youth A had 15-30\ncavities since coming into care (December 2019), after having no cavities prior to foster\ncare. Youth A saw a dentist in July 2021 to have some fillings done, after months of\nwaiting. Parent 1 reported that this matter has been resolved at this time.\nChief Administrator\nOn 7/22/21 the agency’s Chief Administrator (CA) was informed of the allegations and\nreported anticipating the investigation as the children’s mother (Parent 1) has been very\nvocal about her dissatisfaction with the case direction.\nSupervisor\nOn 7/26/21 the Supervisor was interviewed at the agency. The Supervisor reported the\ncase has been open since late 2019, although not adjudicated yet due to delays from\nCOVID-19 and Parent 1’s desire to have a jury trial. The trial was scheduled for August\n2021. A follow-up call occurred with the CA on 8/31/21. The CA reported that court found\nParent 1 to be guilty and adjudicated the case on 8/26/21.\nThe Supervisor reported Youth A and Youth B have had several dental exams since\ncoming into care. Youth A did not have 15-30 cavities, although he did have several. Many\nof the cavities occurred while Youth A was living with Parent 1 or the relative caregiver. An\ninitial dental exam was completed on 2/1/20. Follow up exams were slightly delayed due to\nthe global pandemic (COVID-19) that began in March 2020 and caused businesses to\nclose and the state to be in lockdown. Follow-up dental exams were completed in\nSeptember, and November 2020, March, June, and July 2021. The supervisor noted that\nduring the July dental visit, Youth A threw a needle at the dentist. Youth A was then\nreferred to a pediatric dentist on 8/10/21.\nRegarding eye exams, Parent 1 did not initially tell the agency the children may need\nglasses. The children did not come in to care with glasses and did not inform the worker of\nany vision problems. Parent 1 did not mention the vision needs until the children moved\nfrom the relative caregiver’s home and into a foster home that Parent 1 did not like.\nParent 1\nOn 7/27/21 Parent 1 provided additional information regarding the allegation. Parent 1\nstated that Youth A and Youth B were over six months late for eye exams. Parent 1\n4",
    "reported that Youth A is farsighted and needs glasses; Youth B has a cataract that needs\nattention. Parent 1 provided two text message screen shots of a conversation with the\nworker, which Parent 1 felt was evidence of the agency refusing to provide these services.\nAdditionally, Parent 1 reported that staff do not notify her of medical appointments, despite\nstating she could attend them.\nThe text screen shots from Parent 1 were reviewed. The first message was from April 19\n(year unspecified), from Parent 1 to the Foster Care Worker (FCW). The message was\nParent 1 telling the FCW that Youth A’s eye exam was months overdue and accusing the\nFCW of refusing to discuss it. The second message was a response from the FCW on July\n12 (year unspecified) stating that Youth A and Youth B had eye appointments scheduled\nfor July 15.\nParent 1 also provided a text message conversation between the FCW and herself, which\nshe believed was evidence of the FCW not allowing her to attend medical appointments.\nThe text was reviewed and found the FCW provided Parent 1 with the date/time of a dental\nappointment, while trying to schedule a video conference. Parent 1 then asked if she could\nattend the dental appointment. The FCW did not respond.\nFoster Care Worker\nOn 7/29/21 an interview was completed with the assigned Foster Care Worker (FCW). The\nFCW reported the children have attended their well-child exams and dental exams as\nrequired by policy. None of their medical care is overdue. When the FCW was assigned to\nthe case she completed a case review and found that, as noted on the initial dental exam,\nYouth A entered foster care with cavities. Therefore, the worker believes any concerns\nabout the children being neglected in care, resulting in cavities, are unfounded. Any\ncavities that have been found, have been addressed, or are in the process of treatment.\nThe FCW noted some delay in 2020, due to dental offices closing during the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe FCW reported that neither the children nor their mother identified any concerns about\ntheir vision until April 2021. Once the FCW was informed of Parent 1’s concern about their\nvision, the Foster Parent (FP) was contacted and instructed to schedule eye exams. The\nFP had some difficulty finding a provider that would accept the children’s insurance. An\neye exam was completed in July 2021. The FCW noted the case file indicated that neither\nyouth wore glasses when they entered care in 2019. Nor did they express they were\nmissing glasses or had any difficulty with their vision.\nFoster Parent 1\nFoster Parent 1 (FP1) stated that he had placement of the children for approximately six\nmonths. At the time he accepted placement, a dental exam was already scheduled.\nAlthough the dental office was approximately an hour away, he kept the appointment.\nWhen he and the kids arrived at the appointment with Parent 1, they learned it had been\ncancelled. FP1 rescheduled the appointment for 11/5/20 to have four cavities filled for\nYouth A. However, on the day of that appointment Youth A and Parent 1 asked that only\ntwo cavities be filled, as they wanted to go out to dinner for the anniversary of the children’s\n5",
    "father passing. The dentist filled two cavities on 11/5/20 and planned to do the other two at\na later appointment in December. However, due to Youth B complaining about her mouth\nhurting, Parent 1 canceled the December appointment and scheduled an earlier\nappointment at another dental office. When they arrived at the appointment, FP1 learned it\nwas an emergency dental office, and they would not do any of the work for 6-8 weeks.\nBefore the next appointment took place, FP1 requested removal of both children. FP1\nreported no difficulties with the children or the agency. The reason for replacement was due\nto disruptive and harassing behavior by Parent 1.\nFP1 reported that neither child wore glasses while placed in the home. Neither child ever\nmentioned previously having or needing glasses, or any difficulty with vision or headaches\nthat might indicate a problem.\nDocuments reviewed\n A review of MiSACWIS confirmed an eye exam occurred for Youth A and Youth B\non 7/15/21. Youth A and Youth B were prescribed glasses. A cataract was not\ndocumented for Youth B.\n Initial intake paperwork was reviewed and found no indication by Parent 1 or DHHS\nthat either child needed an eye exam, wore glasses, or had vision trouble.\n A review of all Family Team Meetings found no mention of either child needing eye\nexams.\n The children’s case file documented several dental exams in 2020 and 2021 for\nYouth A. Youth A was treated for six cavities from February 2020 to November\n2020. The file documented that Youth B also had multiple dental exams in 2020 and\none in April 2021. Two cavities were found and treated, with some delay due to\nCOVID-19 and offices being closed. It was further noted that medical exams were\ncompleted timely for Youth A and Youth B in 2020 and 2021.\n Contacts in MiSACWIS and texts provided by Parent 1, showed communications\nfrom the FCW notifying Parent 1 of upcoming medical and dental appointments.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(1) An agency's medical and dental care policy shall, at a\nminimum, include all of the following:\n(f) The provision of a dental examination and any\ntreatment required for each child who is 4 years of age and\nolder, including both of the following:\n(ii) A dental reexamination shall be obtained at least\nevery 18 months, unless a greater frequency is indicated.\nANALYSIS: There was no information found to support the allegation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n6",
    "ALLEGATION:\nStaff are not meeting with youth monthly.\nINVESTIGATION:\nParent 1 reported the agency lies in court, claiming to have completed foster home visits\nwhich have not occurred. Parent 1 also reported that staff do not return her calls or respond\nto emails and often shorten her parenting time, in order to discuss the case.\nSupervisor and FCW\nDuring interviews with the FCW and Supervisor, both staff reported that all home visits\nwere completed as reported. The FCW noted that during recent foster home visits, the\nchildren have not been receptive to speaking with her and have made threats about hurting\nher. The FCW indicated this is related to how their mother has discussed people involved in\nthe case. The FCW further reported that she will continue to visit the children monthly and\nattempt to engage with them, even if they are not responsive.\nBoth staff reported that Parent 1 will call, text, and email several times a day and become\nhostile when she feels they are not responding to her. Staff have been trying to engage\nwith her as necessary, but not feed into unrealistic expectations of communication. Parent\n1 has been rude, harassing, and threatening toward staff. If staff do not respond to her\nimmediately, she will keep calling until they do. Parent 1 also records all interactions and\nposts many of them online.\nThe FCW noted that she has asked Parent 1 to come to parenting time early on occasions\nto review the treatment plan, discuss referrals, or other case matters. The intent is to\nhandle these issues prior to the visit time. However, Parent 1 has not arrived on time for\nthese discussions, which then spills into scheduled parenting time. The FCW stated that\nparenting time has never been cut short and that extra time has been allowed when\nneeded.\nFoster Parents\nOn 8/31/21 interviews were conducted with the children’s current; Foster Parent 2 (FP2)\nand former foster parent; Foster Parent 1 (FP1). The foster parents reported that a foster\ncare worker had visited the home each month and observed and/or spoke with the children,\nfor the duration of their placement in the foster homes.\nDocuments reviewed\n A review of the children’s case record found monthly foster home visits completed\nfor the duration of the case. It was noted that some visits were completed virtually,\nvia video call, due to COVID-19 restrictions in early 2020 and a time in 2021 when\nthe foster family had to quarantine due to a COVID-19 exposure.\n Parenting time notes were reviewed and found to be consistent with the information\nreported by the foster care worker.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nAn agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nparenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the\nfollowing:\n(b) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster\nchild and the foster parent in the foster parent's home at\nleast once every month.\n(c) Provisions for visits between parents and children\nexcept where parental rights have been terminated or when\nthere is a court determination that visits are detrimental to\nthe child.\nANALYSIS: There was no information found to support the allegation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nStaff allowed children to stay in an unsafe foster home.\nINVESTIGATION:\nParent 1 reported the agency allowed her children to reside in a foster home which “starved\nand abused (them) mentally and physically”. Parent 1 did not provide further details.\nSupervisor\nDuring an interview with the Supervisor, she reported that while the children were placed\nwith Foster Parent 1, Parent 1 made several allegations. Initially, Parent 1 and Foster\nParent 1 got along well. But then Parent 1 began making claims the foster parent was\nspeeding, using alcohol, and not protecting the children from another child in the home.\nFoster Parent 1 eventually put in a request to have the children removed, due to threats\nand harassment by Parent 1. The Supervisor did not have any concerns about the safety of\nthe foster home.\nFoster Care Worker\nFCW indicated that Parent 1 and Foster Parent 1 initially got along. Parenting time was\noccurring at the foster home and they were going on outings together with the children. But\nthen Parent 1 began making allegations, which were dismissed by DHHS (Children’s\nServices). The allegations include reports that Youth A was not being treated fairly and was\nbeing mistreated by another child in the home. Parent 1 also reported the kids did not eat\nenough at the foster home. The FCW reported having several conversations with both\nchildren, in which they reported having enough food and being able to get snacks\nwhenever they want. The FCW had also observed, and took pictures of the food in the\n8",
    "home, and determined there was sufficient food in the home for all residents. The FCW did\nnot have any concerns about Foster Parent 1 or the children’s safety in the home.\nFoster Parent 1\nFP1 reported that while things started out well with Youth A and Youth B in the home, they\nquickly changed. FP1 stated that Parent 1 inserted herself in every situation, often creating\nproblems with the children and the agency. The kids were well behaved while in his home\nand got along well with another child in the home that was in the process of being adopted.\nThe other child in the home was cognitively impaired, autistic, and diagnosed with\nOppositional Defiance Disorder. FP1 stated that the kids would have disagreements at\ntimes, but nothing violent. Youth B enjoyed spending time with the other child. While Youth\nA would aggravate the other child at times and then tell on her, or tell his mother about it,\nwhich would result in an allegation.\nFP1 gave the example of one incident where the adoptive child became upset, FP1 told\nYouth A and Youth B to go into the bathroom, so they would be safe if the other child\nbecame physically aggressive. Youth A later told Parent 1 that they were locked in the\nbathroom. Which was untrue. Parent 1 filed a report with DHHS. This was one of many\nallegations Parent 1 made. FP1 denied all of the allegations, indicating the agency\npreviously investigated them and found the allegations to be false. Specifically FP1 stated\nthat the children always had meals and snacks to eat. No one was ever hungry in the\nhome. FP1 also stated the children were always safe in the home.\nDocuments reviewed\nA review of the foster home file found that three special evaluations were completed while\nYouth A and Youth B were placed there. The investigations did not determine any\nviolations regarding Parent 1’s concerns nor were there any finding of the children being\nabused or neglected.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in\nthe agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule: (a) Submit a\nspecial investigation record to the department’s licensing\nauthority within 5 working days in the manner prescribed\nby the department. (b) Initiate a special evaluation of the\nfoster home as soon as is indicated, based on the\ninformation received, but not later tan 7 calendar days after\nreceipt of the information.\nANALYSIS: There was no information found to support the allegation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n9",
    "ALLEGATION:\nStaff are falsely reporting information.\nINVESTIGATION:\nParent 1 reported the agency perjured themselves in court by reporting dates of Family\nTeam Meetings and home visits that did not happen. Parent 1 did not indicate any specific\ndates of FTMs or home visits that were falsely reported. Parent 1 further indicated the\nagency has lied and stated she was a drug user. Parent 1 also reported the agency was\nlying in their most recent report to the court and intentionally left out a “very positive” report\nfrom the parenting coach she is working with. Parent 1 indicated the agency left positive\ninformation out because it did not support “the narrative presented” by the FCW and\nSupervisor. Indicating the agency lies in order to keep her children in foster care.\nParent 1 provided several documents to DCWL, which she believed would confirm her\nallegations:\n Parent 1 provided a link to a ‘Youtube’ video she uploaded, which was an audio\nrecording of a court hearing from 3/1/21. The video was very difficult to understand.\nAccompanying the video was copies of correspondence she had with law\nenforcement, when she attempted to press charges of perjury against the former\nfoster care worker. Ultimately, the law enforcement officer informed Parent 1 there\nwas no violation of criminal law to pursue charges.\n Parent 1 provided a video, which she indicated would prove the “gratuitous\nmishandling” of the family’s case and “misconduct” that occurred. The video was a\nrecorded phone conversation between Parent 1 and her mother, in which Parent 1 is\nstating she was late for a meeting, but it did not matter. There was no information to\nsupport misconduct by anyone at the agency.\n Parent 1 provided a letter written by the parenting coach. The letter indicated that\nParent 1 demonstrates love and affection with her children. However, she would\nbenefit from Parenting Education services (beginning on 8/26/21). These services\nare intended to allow the parent to work on power struggles, nurturing discipline, and\npositive communication. It further stated that weekly family counseling was\nrecommended to work on negative relational habits that are part of the family\ndynamic.\n Parent 1 provided a copy of a drug test dated 8/16/21, indicating that it would prove\nthe agency is lying about her using drugs. The drug screen was reviewed and found\nthat Parent 1 was positive for marijuana.\nSupervisor\nSupervisor reported that all home visits and FTMs occurred as documented. The\ncaseworkers have not lied in court. Although there was one situation where a worker sent a\ncourt report to Parent 1’s attorney and did not send a copy to Parent 1. This was discussed\nand resolved in court. However, Parent 1 believed it was perjury when the worker said she\nsent the report, only to later realize she forgot to copy Parent 1 on the email. The court did\nnot view this as perjury, as the worker was not under oath, and the report was provided to\nthe parent’s legal representative.\n10",
    "Supervisor reported Parent 1 is prescribed Suboxone and admitted to using Fentanyl until\n2019, and smoking marijuana currently. This information was provided in court accurately.\nHowever, drug screens had not yet been court ordered.\nFoster Care Worker\nThe FCW reported that Parent 1 previously claimed she was not being invited to FTMs.\nShe later said that she “found” the invitations in her email. The agency is now emailing and\ntexting all FTM invites.\nThe FCW reported all FTMs and home visits have occurred as documented while she has\nbeen assigned to the case. The FCW was not aware of any fraudulent reporting by the\nagency and denied withholding information that would benefit Parent 1’s case.\nFoster Parent 1\nFP1 reported that all monthly home visits had been completed by case workers. In addition,\nFP1 stated that Parent 1 participated in all FTMs that he was involved in. FP1 did not\nbelieve the agency falsified any records.\nFoster Parent 2\nFP2 reported that all monthly home visits had been completed by case workers. FP2 also\nreported that, to her knowledge, Parent 1 was involved in every FTM since the children\nwere placed in her home. FP2 was not aware of the agency falsifying any records.\nDHHS Program Manager\nOn 8/31/21 the DHHS Program Manager (PM) was contacted and asked if there were any\nconcerns about how the agency is handling the case or concerns about the agency\nfabricating any information. The PM responded there have been no concerns with the\nagency. DHHS has been supportive of the agency as the case has been challenging. The\nPM reported that Parent 1 has been making allegations and accusations toward everyone\ninvolved in the case, since the beginning. Initially Parent 1 claimed the Children’s Services\nworker lied about her in order to remove the children. Parent 1 records every conversation,\nwith the intent of using it as “evidence” against the agency.\nParenting Coach\nOn 9/1/21 the Parenting Coach confirmed writing the letter that was provided to DCWL by\nParent 1. Parenting Coach clarified that Parent 1 initially started with Parenting Time\nSupport, which occurs during parenting time and provides feedback and intervention when\nneeded. After receiving this service for some time, Parent 1 was then recommended for\nParenting Education, which is a one to one, intensive in-home program that provides\nparents with tools.\nDocuments reviewed\n A review of Youth A and Youth B’s case records was completed. The review found\nseveral FTMs that had occurred from December 2019 to July 2021. Each FTM\n11",
    "indicated that Parent 1 attended the meeting either in person, or via phone/video\ndue to COVID-19.\n As noted under rule R400.12421 (b), this investigation determined there was no\nindication of staff falsifying home visits.\n Service plans from January 2020 to May 2021 were reviewed. All information\nreviewed is consistent with information provided by agency staff, DHHS staff, and\nservice providers in this investigation. In addition, there were several documented\ninstances of Parent 1 being verbally abusive and threatening toward agency staff,\nDHHS staff, and other service providers. Parent 1 was also documented to make\nfalse allegations and encourage Youth A and B to act inappropriately toward agency\nstaff. This behavior could impact her credibility as a witness to potential wrongdoing\nby the agency.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nPA 116 Investigation, inspection, and examination…\n722.120\nSec. 10. (1) The department may investigate, inspect, and\nexamine conditions of a child-care organization and may\ninvestigate and examine the books and records of the\nlicensee.

However,\ntheir placement changed in March 2021 and they were placed on another waiting list with\nCommunity Mental Health (CMH). Therapy services then began in June 2021.\n12",
    "Foster Care Worker\nThe FCW reported initially Parent 1 refused to sign a release for Youth B to receive therapy\nservices at CMH. Eventually Parent 1 signed the release and Youth B was placed on a\nwaiting list in the county of her placement. Youth A was also placed on the waiting list.\nYouth B then moved and was placed on another waiting list. Services were further delayed\nwhen Parent 1 decided not to sign some of the intake paperwork for Youth A and Youth B.\nParent 1 eventually returned the paperwork, although it was incomplete. Regardless,\ntherapy services began and Youth A and Youth B were seen every other week, while the\ntherapist determined a clear picture of goals. The therapists plan was to develop a\ntreatment plan and begin seeing both youths weekly. It is anticipated that weekly therapy\nwill begin in September 2021.\nFoster Parent 2\nFP2 reported both Youth A and Youth B are in bi-weekly therapy. The therapist expressed\nwanting to do some sessions of ‘discovery’ before developing a treatment plan and moving\ninto individual sessions. FP2 reported that both children have been attending their therapy\nsessions.
