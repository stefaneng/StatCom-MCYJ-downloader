The remaining violation was repeated during this inspection.\nAdditionally, 1 of the 6 violations established within this report have been repeated\nduring the past two licensing inspections and will require additional corrective action\nplanning. The agency’s violations have increased from 6 established in 2021 to 12 in\n2022. It is assessed that the increase in violations was due mostly to one-time errors\nor delays in completing paperwork timely and does not present a pervasive\ndecrease in compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment – The chief administrator assessment was\nprovided and discussed during the entrance meeting. The chief administrator\naccurately identified areas of non-compliance which were largely attributed placement\ncrises requiring staff to be physically present with youth and/or working extensively on\nlocating available and appropriate placements.\nInterviews – The staff members interviewed reported no concerns.\nVII. DCWL Analyst Concerns\nNo safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or policy.
