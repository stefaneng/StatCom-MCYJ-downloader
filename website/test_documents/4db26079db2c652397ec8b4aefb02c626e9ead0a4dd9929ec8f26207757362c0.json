This was\nan emergency placement intended to be a respite. Foster Child N remained in the\nfoster home beyond 14 days. As of 4/17/21, the placement was no longer considered a\nrespite.\nOn 5/13/21, DCWL received an online complaint alleging the above against Vista Maria.\nFoster Child N was removed from Foster Parent 1’s home on 5/17/21.\nI notified Vista Maria’s Chief Administrator, Quality Manager and Foster Care Program\nManager of the complaint and requested the following documents:\n1) Verification that Foster Child N’s medical authorization card was given to Foster\nParent 1 upon placement.\n2) Verification that a mental health screening of Foster Child N was completed\nwithin 30 days after placement.\n3) Verification of placement documentation provided to Foster Parent 1 upon\nplacement and/or within 7 days after placement.\n4) Verification that Foster Child N was enrolled in school within 5 days of\nplacement.\n5) Proof that Foster Parent 1 has received payment for Foster Child N.\nAs of 5/24/21, Vista Maria provided documentation that Foster Parent 1 has received\npayment for Foster Child N and noted Foster Child N was still enrolled in his original\nschool at the time he was placed with Foster Parent 1.

As of 5/24/21, MISACWIS\nonly showed one case contact occurred between a Vista Maria foster care worker,\nthe child and the foster parent on the date of placement (4/2/21). The Program\nManager indicated the original assigned foster care worker observed the child with\ntwo duffle bags full of clothing at the time of placement, and neither the foster child\nnor the foster parents have complained of him needing clothing or made a clothing\nrequest.\nCase notes indicate Foster Parent 1 notified the foster care worker twice that Foster\nChild N was self-harming and experiencing “panic attacks.” There was no evidence\nthat the worker referred him for a mental health assessment or treatment.\n4",
