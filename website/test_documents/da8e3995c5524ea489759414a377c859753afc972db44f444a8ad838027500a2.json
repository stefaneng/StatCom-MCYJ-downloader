Youth\nhave used keys to access a medicine cabinet and houses.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews:\nAssigned DCWL Consultant/Complainant was interviewed via TEAMS on\n7/20/22. Consultant reported she reviewed 3 MISACWIS incident reports dated\n7/8/22, 7/11/22 and 7/13/22, which all noted that youth took staff member’s keys.\nThe incident reports noted that youth were accessing the medication room,\nmedication cart, took youth allowances and/or entering the other houses on campus.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on 7/28/22. On 7/11/22, Staff 1 was in the\nmedication room and was about to pass a PRN medication to a youth. A coworker\ntold him that they needed support out in the yard for youth approaching Renucci.\nStaff 1 left the key inserted in the medication cart in the rush of things but made sure\nto shut the locked medication room door. Staff 1 stated because the youth had the\nstaff key, they were able to access the medication room, and had access to the\nmedication cart because the key was left in it. Staff 1 said there is not a policy\nspecifically referencing keys, however, there is a culture at the facility that keys need\nto be protected, safe and always with staff. Staff 1 admitted to making a mistake and\nis aware medications need to be double locked at all times, which means the\nmedication cart needs to be locked and needs to remain in the locked medication\nroom.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on 7/28/22. Staff 2 reported on 7/13/22, he\nwas attempting to lock the staff bathroom and Youth A grabbed his keys out of his\nhand. Youth A, Youth B, Youth C and Youth D were tossing the keys amongst each\nother while approximately 4 staff and the supervisor tried to retrieve them. Youth D\nretrieved the keys and gave them back to Staff 2, but Staff 2 noticed his staff key\nwas missing. About an hour later, the youth entered the medication room in Renucci,\nbut were not able to access the medication cart due to staff presence.

Staff 3 said his key was retrieved\napproximately 2-3 days later. Staff 3 is unsure where allowances are kept now, but\nknows they are no longer kept in the medication cart. Staff 3 noted medications are\nto be double locked, which means the medication cart must be locked at all times\nand remain in the locked medication room.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via telephone on 7/28/22. Staff 4 reported youth have\nbeen taking keys out of staff’s pockets, out of staff’s hands and look for any other\nopportunities they may have to take staff keys. Staff 4 reported she retrieved Staff\n3’s key after Youth A and Youth C took it and went AWOL for 2-3 days. Staff 4\nreported during that 2–3-day timeframe, Youth A and Youth C continued to return to\nthe facility to use the keys to enter the commons building and different houses to\nsteal items.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via telephone on 7/28/22. Supervisor 1 reported\nYouth A took a staff’s keys on 7/13/22 and Supervisor 1 was attempting to retrieve\nthem.

Supervisor 2 reported he retrieved the medication cart key and Staff 3’s\npersonal keys, but Youth A and Youth C went AWOL with Staff 3’s staff key.\nChief Administrator and Director were interviewed face-to-face at the facility\non 7/22/22 and 8/12/22. They reported the staff keys open the other buildings on\ncampus as well as the doors in the homes, including the medication rooms and staff\nbathrooms.

Youth D advised all\nthe youth know where each of the keys are located to gain access to the medication\ncart, so if youth get a staff key, they know the steps they need to follow next.
