EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The first\nCAP was submitted in response to the 2024 licensing renewal inspection dated\n8/29/2024 and was approved on 9/19/2024. That CAP addressed 18 licensing rule\nviolations and 4 MDHHS policy violations no longer regulated by DCWL. Of the 18\nlicensing violations addressed, 12 were cited as repeat violations during this\ninspection. Additionally, the number of overall violations increased this year from\n22 to 31. It is noted the agency experienced a near complete turnover in staffing,\nin part due to poor performance and practice by a number of staff, including the\nagency program manager.\nThe second CAP was in response to special evaluation report 2025SIC0000544\ndated 7/9/2025 and was approved 7/18/2025.

    "failure to complete their job responsibilities and falsifying social work contacts. The\ninitial verification with CAP compliance was completed and the agency has\ndemonstrated compliance with each action step identified. Final verification of\ncompliance with the CAP will be completed in December.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator report dated 9/25/2025 was reviewed and discussed\nduring the entrance meeting. The Chief Administrator indicated the significant\nturnover in agency staff during the period under review has resulted in difficulty\nmaintaining overall compliance as the majority of staff hired have little to no\nprevious foster care experience. These staff are in the process of learning all\naspects of compliance related to their job responsibilities. Conversely, the agency\nhas hired a leadership team with many years of combined experience which the\nChief Administrator notes will lead to more stable and efficient foster care team.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency's annual financial audit was reviewed for fiscal year 2024. No financial\nconcerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed all reported there have been many staffing\nchanges which have led to adjustments in how work is being done. Primarily,\nchanges in leadership have also changed worker expectations, which has, at\ntimes, caused frustration. Despite these challenges, the staff report feeling\nsupported by their current direct supervisors and upper management. They feel\nthey can rely on their supervisors and teammates to assist when needed and to\nprovide any answers while they are learning.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office is located in a building with other non-profit agency offices and\nhas access to an interior hallway as well as direct access to the outside. The office\nis secured through locked doors at all entrances. The staff work area with space\nand equipment to provide for foster care, licensing, and adoption service delivery\nis located behind a second locked door, which is also where the files are securely\nstored. Physical CHRI is stored in a locked cabinet next to a cross shredder within\nthe Program Manager's office.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns were identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n12",
