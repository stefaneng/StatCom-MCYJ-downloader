Youth A\nrecalled the morning of 02/26/2025 when he had asked Staff 3 for\nbatteries and Staff 3 did not respond to him. Youth A recalled\nYouth B interrupting him and he started to argue with Youth\nB. This occurred near both of their bedrooms in the\nhallway. Youth A believed it was Staff 2 that restrained Youth A\nand moved Youth A to his own bedroom. Youth A did not see or\ninteract with Youth B after this occurred. Youth A recalled laying\non his side on his bed, with Staff 2 putting his fist on the side of\nYouth A’s face and holding it down against the bed.

Youth A picked up another shoe and Staff 2\ntook it out of his hand. Youth A told Staff 2 to leave him alone,\nand Staff 2 responded by stating “If you hit me, I am going to\nchoke you.” Youth A tried to take his shoe back from Staff\n2. Staff 2 proceeded to put his hand on Youth A’s neck and\npushed Youth A backwards. Youth A began to calm down,\ntransitioning from being angry to being sad and crying. He stated\nStaff 2 backed away from Youth A. Youth A recalled hearing Staff\n2 state to Staff 1 that they would need to restrain Youth A. Youth\nA believed Staff 1 then came in the room and took Youth A’s bible\n2",
    "that had been laying nearby. Staff 1 told Youth A to stop touching\nhim, and if Youth A did not, Staff 1 would throw the bible out of the\nwindow. Youth A recalled seeing Staff 2 open Youth A’s bedroom\nwindow and Staff 1 threw the bible out of the window. Youth A\ncommented he had not thrown anything out of his window himself\nand he had not touched his bible that morning.

Staff 1\nrecalled getting involved in the incident when Youth A was inside\nof his room and Staff 2 was standing near Youth A’s doorway to\nthe bedroom.

Staff 2 walked Youth A to his bedroom in an attempt\nto reduce the chances of the interaction escalating further. Staff 2\ndescribed this as a guided assist, holding Youth A’s upper arms\nand Youth A walking with him to the bedroom. Staff 2 believed\nYouth A did this under his own power and did not recall Youth A\nresisting him or trying to further interact with Youth B. Once Youth\nA went into his room, Staff 2 believed he stayed near the\ndoorway. Youth A became more upset and began to throw items\naround the room. These items included shoes and books.

    "window, including shoes, clothing and books. Staff 2 denied ever\ntouching any of Youth A’s items or throwing them out of the\nwindow.

Staff 4 recalled seeing Staff 2 attempt to use proxemics\nto get in between Youth A and the window, and Staff 4 was not\nsure if Staff 2 had any contact with Youth A.
