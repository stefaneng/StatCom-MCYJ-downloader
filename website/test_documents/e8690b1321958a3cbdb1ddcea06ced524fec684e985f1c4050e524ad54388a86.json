    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff called Complainant and heard staff yelling at youths over the\nphone.\nInvestigation This incident occurred on 1/7/24 and I was assigned to investigate\nit on 1/16/24. The Placement Collaboration Unit was also\nassigned.\nInterviews:\nI contacted Complainant/Youth J’s mother on 1/16/24. She stated\nMed Tech called her on 1/7/24 and through the phone, she heard\nMed Tech and other female staff yelling at youths. “I was\npetrified. I didn’t feel safe.” I asked Complainant if she knew why\nMed Tech called her. She said she thought Youth J had told Med\nTech that the Complainant would come “whip the Med Tech’s\nbehind.” Complainant was unwilling or unable to provide specific\ndetails relative to her phone conversation with Med Tech.\nI notified Youth J’s Foster Care Worker via email of the assigned\ninvestigation. His worker expressed no additional licensing\nconcerns.\nI interviewed Youth J on 1/17/24. He has been at two different\ndetention facilities and said he likes Mott Children’s Residence\nbest because he has more freedom. I asked Youth J about staff\nyelling at him or other youths while Med Tech was on the phone\nwith his mother. He said he did not know why Med Tech called\nhis mother, but “she called in front of all the kids and stopped\npassing meds for that.” Youth J could not remember what staff\nwas supervising him or what other youths heard the Med Tech’s\nside of the phone conversation.\n2",
    "I asked Youth J about the plan MDHHS has for him. He said the\nplan is to reunite with his mother, but he does not want to reunite\nwith her and prefers to be placed in a foster home. “I don’t want to\nlive with her,” he insisted.\nI interviewed Med Tech, also Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) on\n1/17/24. She has worked at the facility almost two years and said\nshe is trained in physical management. Med Tech said she works\nin the medical office and is not a direct care staff working on the\nresidential units.\nWhen Youth J arrived at the medication window, Med Tech said\nshe offered him Tylenol as needed for pain. Youth J told her\nComplainant told him he could have Ibuprofen. Med Tech clarified\nthat Youth J’s doctor wants him to take Tylenol. “Youth J wouldn’t\nremove himself from the med window so I could finish passing\nmedication. I called his mother to tell her it was wrong to tell her\nson that he could have Ibuprofen when she knew his doctor\nordered Tylenol. Complainant asked, ‘Why are you calling me\nwith this shit?’ I explained I am the nurse and Youth J is giving\nme a hard time at the med window.” Instead of listening to her,\nMed Tech said Complainant focused on the noise in the\nbackground. “I told her ‘Your son is refusing and bullying staff with\nyou overpowering what we are capable of doing and not doing,\nand he’s threatening us for that. Complainant argued and still\nwanted me to give Youth J Ibuprofen. The kids were getting loud\nand impatient. Staff 2 (who works at a sister facility) came and\ntold me I shouldn’t be on the phone, which I thought was rude. I\njust wanted us (Mott staff and Complainant) to be on the same\nside. I hoped calling her would get him to move, but it didn’t.”\nI asked Med Tech if she thought to contact the supervisor on duty\nwhen Youth J refused to move from the medication window. She\nsaid she did not. I asked if she or other staff in the hall were\nyelling at any youth. Med Tech said staff were trying to de-\nescalate youth but not yelling at them. I asked again if she or any\nstaff were yelling. Med Tech said Staff 2 yelled, but she yelled at\nMed Tech, not at the youths.\nI attempted to interview Staff 2 in person on 1/17/24, but she was\nnot working that day. On 1/19/24, I interviewed her via phone.\nStaff 2 said she works at Whaley’s sister facility and does not work\nat Mott Children’s Residence. She said she and two staff from the\nother facility brought five youths to the medication room in Mott for\nMed Tech to dispense their medication. “I observed Youth J at\nthe window with Med Tech on the phone…I don’t know what Mott\n3",
    "staff were there. Youth J was loud and rude to Med Tech. He\nsaid he told Med Tech to call his mother so the youths knew she\nwas talking to his mother. I calmed Youth J down after a couple\nminutes and took him to his unit…Med Tech was on the phone\npretty long, so I redirected her to end the conversation.”\nStaff 2 denied that she, Med Tech, or anyone else were yelling at\nthe youths. She also denied yelling at Med Tech.\nI asked HR Director how Complainant typically interacts with staff\nat the facility. She stated, “Complainant is irrational at times and\ndoes not always follow court orders or residential protocol for\nvisitation. Youth J has refused to see Complainant due to feeling\nembarrassed by her behaviors. Complainant has cussed out\nvarious staff on the phone and in person. When she’s riled, she\nreturns to issues from the past even though they were already\naddressed. Complainant has threatened to sue the agency,\nrecord conversations and cause staff to lose their jobs.”\nHR Director read aloud a portion of the updated service plan by\nStaff 7 dated November 2023. “Complainant has not participated\nin a court-ordered psychological evaluation, family therapy or\nparenting classes. She struggles with emotional stability, talks\nover others, and argues that proper efforts for reunification are not\nbeing offered.”\nCONSULTATION\nIt is best practice that sensitive conversations with a youth’s\nparent be reserved for case management and administrative staff.\nAnalysis Med Tech contacted Complainant about Youth J’s behavior, and\nby doing so, may have acted outside of her designated role.\nHowever, there is no evidence that any staff were yelling at the\nyouth.\nConclusion Violation not established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4146 Immunizations.\nSection\nDescription (4) Nothing in the rules adopted under 1973 PA 116 shall\nauthorize or require immunizations for any child whose parent\nobjects on religious grounds. If a parent objects to immunizations\non religious grounds, the objection shall be made in writing to the\ninstitution and retained in the resident’s file.\n4",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Vaccine given to Youth J without parent's permission. Parent\nobjects based on religious grounds.\nInvestigation Interview:\nComplainant reported Youth J was vaccinated at the facility\nwithout her consent.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nYouth J’s immunization record as of 8/3/23 indicated he has not\nreceived any vaccinations since 10/06/21. Youth J was placed at\nthe facility on 12/13/22.\nAn email exchange between Complainant and Staff 7 dated\n8/29/23 indicated Complainant instructed Staff 7 to never give\nYouth J immunizations, including COVID, without her consent due\nto the family’s religious beliefs. Staff 7 responded confirming\nYouth J has not received any vaccines since he was placed at the\nfacility.\nAnalysis Youth J’s immunization record indicates his parent’s wishes were\nhonored and he has not received vaccinations since he was\nadmitted to the facility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff\nSection\nDescription The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nsupervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation At age 14, Youth J was sexually abused by a 16-year-old. It\nappears Youth J's sexual safety plan has not been implemented.\nInvestigation Documents reviewed:\nI reviewed an internal email exchange from Staff 6 to the facility’s\nEducation Coordinator, HR Director, Director of Clinical Services\nand Director of Residential Services dated 3/1/23. The email\ncontained an email exchange between Staff 6 and Youth J’s\n5",
    "school. A female student at Flex High in Burton reported to a\nteacher that she and Youth J had sex in the bathroom at the\npublic school they both attended.\nI reviewed Youth J’s written sexual safety plan effective 2/28/23.\nThe plan was detailed and extensive.\nInterviews:\nComplainant stated Youth J was sexually abused by a 16-year-\nold.\nHR Director stated the alleged sexual incident happened last year\nat Flex High School, not at the facility. The female student\ninvolved was not a Mott resident, but a former resident from Mott’s\nsister facility. She said the alleged sexual encounter was reported\nto Centralized Intake and was transferred to law enforcement.\nThe facility had Youth J tested for sexually transmitted diseases.\nA sexual safety plan for Youth J was developed and implemented\non 2/28/23. The plan was distributed to residential managers and\nplaced in a binder on Youth J’s living unit.\nAnalysis The alleged sexual assault on Youth J occurred at school and not\nat the licensed child caring institution. Nonetheless, a sexual\nsafety plan was developed for Youth J and implemented at the\nfacility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4123 Education\nSection\nDescription (1) An institution shall not admit a child for care unless an\nappropriate educational program can be provided.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Complainant/Mother is not invited timely to IEPC meetings at\nYouth J's school.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant stated she is not invited to IEPC meetings in a timely\nmanner. “They send it the day of, and the school does not identify\nme as the parent.”\nI interviewed Youth J. He confirmed his mother participates in his\nIEPC meetings via Zoom.\n6",
    "I interviewed HR Director at the facility on 1/17/24. She reported\nYouth J has resided at Mott Children’s Residence since 12/13/22.\nHe received special education at two different public schools since\nhis admission and is currently suspended from Johnson High in\nMt. Morris.\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed a printed school email dated 10/10/23 forwarded to\nComplainant from the facility inviting Complainant to Youth J’s\nIEPC meeting on 10/18/23 via Zoom. HR Director indicated\nComplainant attended that IEPC meeting.\nI also reviewed printed email threads between the facility, school\nand Complainant dated 8/24/23 showing the facility communicated\nwith Complainant regarding their efforts to enroll Youth J into a\nnew school.\nAn email thread between Youth J’s school and the facility dated\n12/18/23 indicated Complainant contact the school and the school\nwas not providing her with information regarding Youth J because\nshe was not listed in their system as a contact person with\nrights/permissions. The facility related back to the school\nComplainant does have legal rights/permissions and participated\nin Youth J’s IEPC meeting on 10/18/23. However, the facility did\nnot add Complainant to the school’s contact list because\nComplainant requires supervision by facility staff in order to have\nin-person or phone contact with her son.\nFurther an email dated 12/18/23 showed Complainant and other\ninterested parties were invited to attend a Manifestation\nDetermination Review Meeting on 1/4/24 via Zoom to determine if\nYouth J’s recent suspension was the result of his disability.\nAnalysis The facility has made sufficient efforts to communicate education\nissues and meeting with Complainant. Appropriate educational\nprogramming is provided to Youth J through the public school\nsystem.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n7",
    "(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth J's behavior is getting worse. Facility is not providing\nappropriate safety planning or therapy services to address Youth\nJ's needs.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant said Youth J’s behavior is getting worse and the\nfacility is not providing appropriate safety planning or anger\nmanagement therapy.\nHR Director stated Youth J has exhibited no inappropriate sexual\nbehaviors since an incident that occurred at his public school on\n2/28/23.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nI reviewed a sexual safety plan by Director of Residential Services\nfor Youth J dated 2/28/23. The written safety plan was placed in a\nbinder on the unit and was detailed and extensive.\nI reviewed a list of individual therapy sessions completed, offered,\nor rescheduled with Youth J by internal and outside resources.\nFrom 1/11/23 – 6/21/23, therapy was provided to Youth J by an\noutside resource. During that period, Youth J participated in 14\nsessions, refused 8, and 3 were rescheduled due to inclement\nweather or therapist out of the office.\nFrom 6/29/23 – 1/12/24, therapy was provided to Youth J directly\nby the facility. During that period, Youth J participated in 25\nsessions, refused 3, and 6 were rescheduled due to conflicts with\nYouth J’s basketball games/practice.\nAnalysis Documentation showed Youth J had an appropriate safety plan in\nplace at the facility and individual therapy services to address his\nneeds were and are still being provided.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n8",
