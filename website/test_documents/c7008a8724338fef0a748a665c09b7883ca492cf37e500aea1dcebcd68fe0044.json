TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nThere was no technical assistance requested or required during this inspection.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• R400.12212(2)(f) (g)Personnel record: The agency is advised if an\napplicant’s/employee’s ICHAT results shows arrest information with the\ncharge and judicial sections left blank exploration of the arrest matter would\nprove beneficial to ensure the person does not have a conviction and to\nensure compliance to these subrules.\n• R400. 12417 Foster parent information: The agency was advised that\namending its placement/replacement form to include a heading, circumstance\nleading to placement / replacement; and or having the foster parent to sign-off\non the placement outline form, may also aid it in demonstrating compliance\nwith the rule.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period. That corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024\nInterim inspection where it received 9 rule violations. During this 2025 Renewal\ninspection the agency received 5 rule violations, 1 is a repeat violation from 2024;\nand 2 from the agency’s 2023 renewal inspection. The agency’s corrective action\nplan compliance around these 3 rule violations is as follows: the number of\nindividual cases cited increased from 1 of 6 to 3 of 8 related to the repeat violation\nfrom 2024. In terms of the repeat violations from 2023, the number of individual\ncases cited decreased from 2 of 5 to 1 of 5 on the first; and the second citation\nremained the same. A review of the agency’s 2024 Interim corrective action plan\nshowed it completed and or implemented all aspects of the corrective action plan.\nThe agency continues its efforts to gain greater compliance on all rules.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s (CA) report dated 6/3/2024. The CA\nreported the agency has been more consistent in maintaining staff and the CAP",
    "put in placed worked well with supervisors and staff when it was followed. The CA\nreported a number of their staff have time-management and organizational issues,\nand the program manager and new supervisor are working to provide those staff\nwith techniques to assist them. Additionally, the CA reported holding monthly CAP\nreview meetings was helpful to hold supervisors accountable for rule compliance;\nand their institution of various checklists aids staff with compliance when the\nchecklists are utilized. The CA further reported the agency continues to offer\ntrauma and behavior management training to foster parents on a regular basis so\nas to help the foster parent better understand a foster child’s behavior.\nDuring the entrance conference the agency reported staff morale remains high;\nand they have learned more structured training is needed for some staff. The\nagency reported it is providing that extra training and support to staff. They also\nreported recruitment of foster homes has been more difficult; some of which\ncenters around safety, as impacted by the foster parent tragedy that was in the\nNews. The agency reported it has continued to safeguard around this area; and\nworkers are doing more transporting of the foster children for parent/child visitation\nas opposed to the foster parent.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a 2025 annual budget, and independent financial audit dated\nfor 9/30/2024 and 2023. A review of these documents did not show indications of\nany notable areas of concern.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, licensee designee, 2 foster\ncare supervisors, the licensing supervisor, and adoption supervisor, I interviewed\na licensing worker, adoption worker, foster care worker, and a foster care\nsupervisor. No concerns were reported. Areas of strengths cited by the staff\nincluded, the agency having good workers and supervisors, the flexibility of the\njob, all teams working well together to get things accomplished, and the many\nresources offered foster parents, children’s families and staff. Areas mentioned as\nneeding improvement were turnaround time for business cards for new staff; and\nensuring that all teams are operating under the same expectations.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency's office did not reveal any safety concerns. There\nappears to be sufficient equipment for staff; and case and program files were\nsecurely stored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one safety alert during this licensing period.\nSafety Alert: The safety of the home could not be assessed. There were several\nphone calls and text messages left for the foster parent and no response was\nreceived from the foster parent.",
    "Resolution: The agency’s licensing supervisor attempted to contact the foster parent\nby telephone and text message on 4/28/2025. No response was received from the\nfoster parent; and therefore, a special evaluation was initiated on the foster home.\nThere are no children placed in the foster home.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJune 25, 2025\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 26, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
