Chief Administrator stated that he spoke\nwith the previous administrator of the facility and neither of them\nwere able to recall any situations where there was concern of fight\nclub type behavior among youth or sexual assault allegations\nsimilar to those presented in these current allegations. The Chief\nAdministrator stated that he could recall Youth A being placed at\nthe facility but never was aware of any sexual assault allegations\nmade by or about Youth A.

    "Documentation reviewed:\nDuring an unannounced, face-to-face visit on 10/10/2023 to the\nfacility to initiate the investigation, the following was reviewed:\n• Youth A’s case file was reviewed. He was placed at the\nfacility from 06/15/2021-03/9/2022. There were multiple\nincident reports involving physical altercations between\nYouth A and other youth but none that matched the\ndescription from the allegations. No other pertinent\ninformation was gathered.\n• Staff 1’s employee file was reviewed. Staff 1 was\nterminated from employment on 10/05/2021 due to a\nsubstantiated abuse and neglect case. Allegations from\nthis past case were unrelated to this investigation.\n• Policy was provided by the facility that described corporal\npunishment as an unacceptable practice when staff are\nproviding discipline to youth in the program.\nDHHS Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was no evidence found that staff improperly\nsupervised youth to the effect of youth were fighting or were\nsexually assaulted under their watch.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n01/17/2024\n__________________________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 20, 2024\n__________________________________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n4",
