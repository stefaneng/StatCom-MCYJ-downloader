Upon\nentering the facility, there is a group counseling room to the right and straight ahead a\nlarge reception area. Within this reception area is a small area designated for small\ngroups. To the left of this area is the Dining/recreation area with a counter, sink, and\nrefrigerator. Continuing straight ahead, you enter an area designed for television\nwatching and gaming by the youth. Just to the left of this area are two bathrooms and\n“hygiene sinks”. Turning left and walking down a hallway, you enter the area designated\nfor youth sleeping rooms, laundry room, therapy room, storage rooms, and a staff office.\nThe first door on the left in the hallway is a therapy room followed by the laundry room\non the left also.

    "for youth along with their personal items they enter the program with. Both the laundry\nroom and medication/personal items room are locked, and no youth are allowed in\nthese two areas. Further down the hall the next room on the left is an “’isolation room”\nthat will be used for youth that are sick. This room has a bathroom attached. Next to this\nroom is a bathroom on the left. Across the hall and to the right are two youth sleeping\nrooms. Each room is 1,475 square feet which allows for two youth to sleep in the rooms.\nEach room is set up with beds and dressers, along with closet space for the youth’s\nitems. Further down the hall and next to the first two sleeping rooms on the right is a\nbathroom for the youth. Following this bathroom are two more sleeping rooms both of\nwhich are 1,475 square feet. The facility will be licensed to handle fourteen youth and\nthere is appropriate sleeping rooms for all fourteen. Across the hall from the bathroom is\na room for storage followed by three more 1,475 square foot bedrooms. The last room\nin the hallway is a staff office. Each room has windows and the sleeping room’s\nwindows do not open. If you turned right after entering the facility, you will pass a\nconference room on the right and a “unit supervisor room” on the left. Going down this\nhall, the next room on the right is the locked mechanical room followed by a large\nsupervisor office. Across the hall from these two rooms and on the left of the hallway is\nthe pantry and commercial kitchen. Following the kitchen on the left is another\nmechanical room followed by a staff break room. Across the hall and to the right of the\nhall are four office spaces to be used by staff. Crossing a perpendicular hallway, you\nenter a large “Recreation room” with several storage closets on the left. This recreation\nroom is 14,555 square feet. Turing left when you enter the perpendicular hallway and\nfollowing the hallway you come to a ninety degree turn to the right and on the left is the\ntraining room. Following this room is the “flex office room”. Across the hallway from\nthese two rooms is the second entrance to the recreation room. Outside of the building\nand in the back, is a basketball court and soccer field in a fenced in area. Outside of the\nfenced in area is a large, wooded area and no other buildings are in sight. In the front of\nthe facility is a large parking lot.\nB. Program Description\nBethany Christian Services’ Hacienda de Luz (HdL) program is a specialized,\ncommunity-based, residential facility, equipped to house single, unaccompanied minors.\nThe program boasts a therapeutic modality that is able to treat mental health issues and\nsubstance abuse issues simultaneously. Daily programming builds the youths\nindependent living skills to better prepare them to be successful members of the\ncommunity. This program provides an intensive, routine based, structured setting with\nqualified, bi-lingual, and culturally competent staff members. The facility has an\nimmersive English learning program which encourages youth to build their English\nlanguage and vocabulary skills on a daily basis. This program will serve an all-male\npopulation (14-Youth) between the ages of 14-17 who are unaccompanied minors, new\nto the U.S. Many of these youth offer a unique challenge for treatment due to their\nextensive history of abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and subsequent trauma history\nduring travel to the United States; and may require intensive services in a structured\nenvironment. The home primarily specializes in treating mental health concerns, such\nas PTSD, and substance abuse disorders, simultaneously. The program serves youth\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "who have been screened eligible for community-based living and who are appropriate\nfor the services provided.\nServices provided in this program are described as the following. The youth who are\nreferred to be placed at Hacienda de Luz come with a variety of needs including\nSubstance Abuse, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), history of parental abuse,\nneglect, or abandonment (including human trafficking), lack of education, lack of U.S.\ncultural awareness, minimum independent living skills abilities, and various adjustment\ndisorders that warrant rigorous, thorough, and intensive services. As a result, Hacienda\nde Luz has an intensive therapeutic and educationally based skills training program in\norder to meet these needs, build upon the strengths of youth serviced, and introduce\nnew positive skills. It is anticipated that the youth referred to Hacienda de Luz program\nwill stay in the home until they are either reclassified into the Unaccompanied Refugee\nMinors Program and are ready for independent living, or until they are ready for another\nappropriate placement. This process usually takes approximately 12 months. Upon\nintake, each youth is assigned a bilingual case manager who provides intensive case\nmanagement services. The assigned case manager meets with all new youth within 24\nhours of intake and then at a minimum of weekly thereafter. In addition, within 30 days\nof intake, all incoming youth are assessed to determine what types of behavioral\ninterventions, and a tailored behavioral plan, will be put in place to ensure a successful\ntransition into the home, community, and school. Emergency crisis intervention is\navailable 24/7, with staff directly involved in Bethany Christian Services’ residential\nprograms, taking shifts to cover emergencies.\nThe program at Hacienda de Luz is based upon a differentiation of levels and\nmovement towards the youth’s independence, adjustment, and autonomy from the\nhome. The Personal Independence Education (PIE) system has youth complete a\nvariety of learning opportunities to prepare them for Independent Living. Each level, or\n“PIE slice,” focuses on an area that is necessary to live independently. Once the youth\nmasters a PIE slice, they move onto the next, until the PIE is completed, and they\ngraduate from the program. The PIE slices are identified: Orientation, Culture &\nCommunity, Relationships, Money Management, Home Maintenance, Education &\nEmployment, Health & Wellness, Personal Development, and Transition Independence.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nR 400.4543 Doors\nRule 543. (4) Interior doors to any enclosure which is required\nto have not less than a 1-hour fire resistance rating shall be B-\nlabeled fire doors in labeled frames and shall be equipped\nwith positive-latching hardware and self-closing devices.\nThe Fire Inspection completed on 10/23/21 resulted in a “C” rating. A variance was\ngranted to allow the facility to be licensed for the residential portion of the building\nthat the Qualified Fire Inspector approved for use. The other portion of the building\nwill not be used by youth until an approved A rating is provided and approved by the\nDivision of Child Welfare Licensing. The new fire doors have been ordered but will\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",

(1) In large and secure facilities and all newly\nconstructed and converted facilities, flame-producing-type\nheating devices and incinerators shall be in an enclosure\nproviding at least 1-hour resistance to fire. Adequate\ncombustion air shall be provided directly from the outside\nthrough a permanently open louver. Fire dampers are not\nrequired in ducts penetrating this enclosure.\nThe Fire Inspection completed on 10/23/21 resulted in a “C” rating.

RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend issuance of an original six-month license to this child caring\ninstitution, private for the use of the residential portion of the building only. Upon\nreceipt of an A rating Fire Inspection and approval by Division of Child Welfare\nLicensing the facility can use the recreation and training room, along with staff\noffices.\n11/4/2021\n_______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 5, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
