    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with that CAP is as follows: The one CAP\nsubmitted by the agency during the period under review was written in response to\nthe 2024 licensing inspection. That CAP addressed 11 violations, 2 of which were\npolicy requirements no longer regulated by DCWL. The remaining 9 violations\nwere related to licensing rule requirements all of which were sufficiently addressed\nby the CAP as evidenced by a lack of repeat violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment completed 5/1/2025 was reviewed and\ndiscussed during the inspection entrance. The chief administrator identified areas\nof non-compliance related directly to MDHHS policy requirements, despite there\nbeing a high level of compliance with licensing rule requirements. The chief\nadministrator attributed the areas of non-compliance to staffing challenges such as\nhigh rate of turnover and downsizing from two foster care teams to one.\nFinancial Overview\nReviewed the agency's income statements/budget ending 2/28/2025, financial\nreports and independent auditor's report. No financial concerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed described a high level of support from supervisors and the\nprogram director. Despite there being a lot of staffing changes, the agency\nsupervisors have maintained consistent expectations. This has helped keep staff\non track with their caseload and task management.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency office appears to have adequate space and equipment to provide for\nthe delivery of foster home certification, foster care, adoption, and independent\nliving services. The files are stored securely in a locking file room preventing\nunauthorized access. Physical CHRI is stored in a separate location within a\nlocked office along with the cross shredder. The file/CHRI storage viewed includes\nthe closed adoption files and physical CHRI from the satellite location as well as\nthe main location.\n3",
