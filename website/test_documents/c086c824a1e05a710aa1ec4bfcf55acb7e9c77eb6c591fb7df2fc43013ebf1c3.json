    "5/13/2025. They all reported not witnessing staff currently on their\nphone and staff are following the phone policy. They all reported\nthat staff are attentive to youth’s needs when youth request\nsomething from staff. They denied staff withholding anything and\nthey reported sometimes youth get inpatient and want something\nright away even if a staff is in the middle of helping another youth.\nThey reported sometimes the youth will get upset if staff are\nunable to respond immediately to the youth’s request, but staff try\nto verbally de-escalate the youth.\nStaff 7, Staff 9, Staff 10, and Staff 12 were interviewed via\nphone, separately on 5/13/2025. They reported prior to the new\npolicy, some staff were using their phones during working hours\nsuch as helping youth with homework.

They reported staff\nonly use their phones to call the supervisor if other forms of\ncommunication are not available. They all reported no staff are\nignoring youth, but youth get very demanding if the need is not\nmet immediately.

She reported\nnot using her phone at work and believes Youth A may have\nmade this claim because of Youth A’s dislike for Staff 20. Staff 20\nreported she will spend most of the time at work interacting with\ndifferent youth, but Youth A has refused to interact with Staff 20\nbecause Staff 20 has redirected Youth A and Youth A doesn’t take\nredirection well. Staff 20 also reported knowing of the new phone\npolicy and the enforcement of this policy. She reported staff are\nattentive to youth’s needs and are very supportive of the youth.\n5",

It is\ndocumented on this form that this was investigated by\nAdministrator 1 who documented his findings. “Three youth were\ninterviewed and two staff were interviewed. Camera footage of the\nalleged phone use was also reviewed, and Administrator 1 was\nunable to confirm the allegations of phone use.\nVideo Review:\nThe facility does have camera’s, but none were reviewed because\nthere was no specific dates or times indicated by the complainant\nof phone use or staff refusing to meet a youth’s request.\nWalk-through:\nA walk-through was completed at the facility. The facility is an\nolder building that has evidence of being in the process of having\nrepairs to the walls.

The facility is furnished\nappropriately, especially in the bedroom areas and the plumbing is\nin working order.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as evidenced by interviews with\nstaff, youth, and documents reviews. Evidence indicates staff may\nhave been using their phones for personal issues, but the facility\n6",
    "has addressed this issue with the new enforcement of the phone\npolicy and the purchasing of phone lockers. There is also no\nevidence that staff were not providing for youth’s needs when\nrequested by a youth.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered in making sure the phone policy\nis clear and concise, so staff are able to follow the policy. The\nfacility should also provide another form of communication\nbetween staff such as walkie-talkies to ensure staff can call for\nassistance or get questions answered if no phones are to be on\ntheir person when supervising.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n5/23/2025\n______________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n5/30/2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n7"
