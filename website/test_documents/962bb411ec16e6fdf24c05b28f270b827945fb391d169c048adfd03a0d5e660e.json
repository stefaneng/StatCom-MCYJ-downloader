Staff 18 reported he never had any physical\ncontact or sexual contact with any youth at the facility.

Staff 18 reported he did not take the female youth to the\nstore because his license was suspended so he could not drive.\nStaff 18 reported one time Youth A texted him from a female staff\nmember’s phone to ask him to bring her food, but that was the\nonly text message he ever received from Youth A.
