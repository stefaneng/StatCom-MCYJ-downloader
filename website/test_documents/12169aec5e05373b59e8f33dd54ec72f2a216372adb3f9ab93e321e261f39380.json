    "after showers and started punching him. Youth A reported during\nanother occurrence, Youth D punched him during lunch time.\nYouth A reported on 4/19/24, youth were “horseplaying” and\n“youth beat him up.” Youth A was unsure which youth. Youth A\nwas distracted during interview and continued to look around.\nYouth A would not show any bruises to this consultant, nor would\nhe say where he received them.\n**It is to be noted this intake occurred on 4/17/24. Two of these\nsituations occurred after the intake, whereas only the 4/16/24\nincident occurred before.\nOn 5/3/24, the following interviews were conducted face to\nface at the facility with DHHS Worker 1:\nYouth B:\nYouth B reported he is in Youth A’s current unit.

Nurse 1 reported\nYouth A did not mention any other bruising on his body.\n5",
    "Staff 1:\nStaff 1 reported Youth A antagonizes other youth. Staff 1 reported\nas an example to this, Youth A had spoken disrespectfully about\nYouth C’s deceased grandmother.

On another occasion, Youth A was\nseparated from Youth C after he had provoked Youth C. Staff 1\nreported once Youth A begins to act aggressive, he struggles to\ndeescalate even if the other youth are not engaged. Staff 1\nreported they have never had to restrain Youth A. Staff 1 reported\nthey (unknown other staff) got in between Youth A and another\npeer and Youth A stated “everyone was beating him up” although\nthis never happened.

Staff 2 reported Youth A\nwill go into his room when he is escalated. Staff 2 reports Youth A\nalways thinks others are talking about him and states he is going\nto make complaints to get out of the facility. Staff 2 did not have\ndates of incidents and did not remember any incidents where\nYouth A was physically assaulted outside of the generic\nhorseplaying.\nStaff 3:\nStaff 3 reported she was specifically there for an incident that\noccurred on 4/5/24. Staff 3 reported Youth A was using profanity,\nand she was unsure why. Staff 3 reported she did not know him\nthat well due to him being new, but she recognized that Youth A\nwould lose focus and become angry very quickly. Staff 3 reported\nno one was hurt during this incident and Youth A was placed in his\nroom to deescalate. Staff 3 could not remember who else was\ninvolved. Staff 3 reported this was the only incident she was\ninvolved in. Staff 3 reported she has seen him hitting his head up\nagainst the wall in his bedroom before as a self-harming behavior.\n6",
    "Staff 4:\nStaff 4 reported Youth A is paranoid and is always thinking others\nare after him. Staff 4 reported she was involved in an incident\nwhere Youth A was interacting with other youth in a negative\nmanner.

Staff 5 reported they called for backup and extra staff came\ninto the unit.\nDocument and Video Review:\nThere are no incident reports or video showing Youth A being\nassaulted by Youth B, Youth C and Youth D together. Due to the\nlack of specific time frames, all incident reports were reviewed for\nYouth A. Youth A entered the facility on 3/21/24. By 4/8/24, he\nwas moved to his current unit.\n• Incident Report: 4/5/24: Youth A threw a chair at another\nyouth. The other youth hit Youth A. Staff 4 was present and\nseparated the youth.

Based on video\nobservation, Youth A is not being stomped on or jumped by other\n7",
    "youth. Staff are intervening in each incident noted above.\nAlthough the staff are not restraining the youth, they are\ndeescalating the situation by removing Youth A from the room or\nphysically separating the youth with their own bodies.\nTechnical Assistance: On each video observation it was seen\nthat multiple activities were occurring in the unit. The youth were\nengaged in eating lunch, watching television, listening to music,\nand playing board games. It would benefit the agency to have a\nmore structured environment, focusing on one activity at a time.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nViolation Additional Findings\nType\nAllegation Staff 2 allows youth to “horseplay,” punch and hit each other,\nwrestle, and roughhouse.\nInvestigation The following interviews were completed at the facility on 5/3/24\nwith DHHS Worker 1:\nStaff 2:\nStaff 2 reported the youth “horseplay” and then this escalates into\nfighting.

    "a “group attention,” which is part of their behavior management\nprocedures.\nTherapist 1 provided the Group Attention Policy via email on\n5/6/24. Therapist 1 reported they do not have a policy specific to\nhorseplaying, but “rather methods to intervene when youth are\nhorseplaying.”\nDocuments Reviewed:\nGroup Assistance Problem-Solving Meeting Policy:\n…is a meeting that is requested by a staff or resident to address\nthe negative behavior of another resident…\nAnalysis The agency is in violation of this rule.
