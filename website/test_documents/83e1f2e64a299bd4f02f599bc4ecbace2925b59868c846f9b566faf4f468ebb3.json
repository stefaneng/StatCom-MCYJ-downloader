During the bed check, the staff opened the\nbedroom door, peeked inside, and left.

    "hallway outside her room, snuck through the door leading to the\nboy’s hallway, and went into Youth B’s room from approximately\n1:30-3:00 AM. Youth D reported she hid under Youth B’s bed at\nfirst, but then came out from under the bed and had sex with\nYouth B in his bed. Youth D reported a male staff (didn’t know his\nname) was sitting at the table in the recreation room when she\nsnuck out of her room. Youth D reported while she was in Youth\nB’s room, Staff 1 did not complete any bed checks. Youth D\nreported the same night, Youth C snuck into Youth A’s bedroom,\nand they also did something sexual with each other.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 5/22/24 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported from 4/25/24-4/26/24, he\nremembered there was a lot of movement from all the youth, so\naround 12 AM on 4/26/24, he told them to go to bed. Staff 1\nreported all four youth finally ended up going to bed, so he put his\nair pods in his ears and was “just chillin’”. Staff 1 reported when he\ncompleted bed checks throughout the night, everything seemed\nfine. Staff 1 reported he thought he completed all checks as\nrequired, but it’s possible he missed 2-3 bed checks throughout\nthe night. Staff 1 reported when he completed one bed check, he\nsaw a towel in the door in between the boy’s/girl’s hallway, so he\nremoved it. Staff 1 reported he completes bed checks by knocking\non the door, peeking in, and looking to see if he sees part of the\nyouth’s body. Staff 1 reported he didn’t see anything unusual in\nYouth A, Youth B, Youth C or Youth D’s room when he completed\nbed checks, and he was positive he saw each youth in their own\nbeds each time he completed a check. Staff 1 reported if he would\nhave seen any youth in another youth’s room, he would have told\nthem to leave. Staff 1 reported he doesn’t remember if he dozed\noff or slept during the shift. Staff 1 expressed shocked when he\nwas told he only completed one bed check between 12:50 AM-\n2:50 AM. Staff 1 took accountability for his actions, apologized,\nand said he should have been more alert during the shift. Staff 1\nreported he left his position at the facility because he was dozing\noff on some of his shifts.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via phone on 5/22/24 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 1 reported she is\nStaff 1’s direct supervisor. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 fell asleep\non 3rd shift when he first started working at the facility, and another\nstaff woke him up. Supervisor 1 reported it happened again in\nJanuary 2024. Supervisor 1 reported after the second incident,\nthey moved Staff 1 to 1st/2nd shift instead. However, on one 1st\nshift, Staff 1 fell asleep 2-3 times during the same shift. The\ndirector could hear him snoring, so she woke him up. On 2/27/24,\n4",
    "Supervisor 1 and Supervisor 2 met with Staff 1 and expressed\ntheir concern about his ability to fulfill his role and expectations at\nthe facility. Supervisor 1 reported they gave Staff 1 a few days to\nthink about it and decide what he wanted to do. Supervisor 1\nreported Staff 1 called and said he wanted to continue working at\nthe facility and wanted to continue working 3rd shift, so they\nallowed him to. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 agreed if he was\nhaving any problems staying awake, he would call her. Supervisor\n1 reported at the time of Staff 1’s 90-day evaluation in April 2024,\nshe was going to terminate him based on continued concerns with\nhim dozing off on shift. However, Staff 1 provided his 2 weeks’\nnotice at the evaluation meeting and his last day was scheduled\nfor 5/1/24. Supervisor 1 told Staff 1 he didn’t have to complete 2\nweeks, and he could be done working after their meeting, but he\nwanted to continue working the 2 weeks. Supervisor 1 reported\nthis incident occurred during the 2-week timeframe. Supervisor 1\nreported there was a team group post on 2/14/24 and a staff\nmeeting on 2/28/24 detailing the expectations for bed checks and\ndocumentation because another staff was fired for not completing\nbed checks as required.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n5/13/24 in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 2\nreported the expectation is for staff to put their eyes on youth, so\nyouth are to leave their bedroom doors cracked. Supervisor 2\nreported she and Supervisor 1 randomly pull bed check logs and\nreview video footage to compare them to bed checks, and they\ninform staff of this process as well.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage of the boy’s hallway, girl’s hallway, and recreation\nroom from 4/25/24-4/26/24 were reviewed on 6/10/24. It should be\nnoted there is no audio. The videos for the bedroom hallways\nbegin on 4/26/24 at 12:00 AM and end at 3:25 AM.

The recreation room has access to each of the\nbedroom hallways as well as the kitchen. If sitting with back facing\nthe wall adjacent to the bedroom hallways, you can’t see the\nhallways to see if people are moving.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Staff Schedule from 4/21/24-4/27/24 notes Staff 1 was the\nonly staff assigned to work third shift from 4/25/24-4/26/24.\n• Bed check logs for Youth A, Youth B, Youth C, and Youth\nD documented consistent bed checks were completed\nevery 15 minutes or less, which did not coincide with videos\nreviewed.\n• Progress Note dated 5/8/24 as well as Incident and Risk\nManagement Report Form dated 5/9/24, both authored by\nStaff 2 note Youth D told him she and Youth C conspired\nand succeeded to sneak into Youth A and Youth B’s rooms\none night. Youth D told Staff 2 she had sex with Youth B,\nbut she didn’t think Youth A and Youth C “did anything”.\nStaff 2 notified Supervisor 2. Cameras were reviewed and\nconfirmed the 4/26/24 incident.\no Supervisor 2 completed a post-incident analysis for\nfuture prevention/risk management and noted to\nprevent similar situations in the future, staff are\nexpected not to wear ear plugs, perform bed checks\nas required, and be alert during shift.\n• Bed Check Policy states any staff on duty should not create\nan environment that could induce sleep or create the\nappearance of being asleep. Bedroom checks shall not\nexceed 15 minutes and must be at variable intervals\n(examples provided). Any time a youth is in their room for\nat least 5 minutes, a room check must occur and be\ndocumented on the log, following the interval requirements.\nStaff can use flashlights to do room checks. When staff\nperform a bedroom check, they must answer the following\nfour questions:\n6",
    "o Are all youth in their assigned beds (identify by face,\nbody size, clothing worn at bedtime, etc.)?\no Are youth alive, appear well, and asleep?\no Is the room occupied by only those who should be\nthere?\no Is the room secure?\n• Staff 1 does not have any formal disciplinary records in his\nemployee file. Staff 1’s 90-day evaluation dated 4/2/24\n(signed 4/17/24), identified Staff 1 needed improvement in\nthe areas of attendance, communication, follow-through,\ninitiative, crisis management, and documentation. It noted\n[Staff 1] gave his 2-weeks’ notice at the time of the\nevaluation (4/17/24). It also noted [Staff 1] was having\nissues staying awake on shift, being on time for shift, and\ncommunicating with staff, which was discussed with him on\n1/29/24.

    "- Since the beds are high enough for youth to fit underneath,\nthe facility should consider updating the bed check policy to\ninclude checking under beds to ensure the room is\noccupied by only those youth who should be there if youth\naren’t accounted for elsewhere.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & ACT 116 - 722.120 Investigation, inspection, and examination\nSection of conditions, books, records, and reports; access by\nDescription department, bureau of fire services, or local authorities;\nrecords; reports report; forms; confidentiality; disclosure of\ninformation; availability of confidential records; child\ninformation cards to be provided to department; failure of\nlicensee to cooperation with investigation, inspection or\nexamination.\n1.

Supervisor 1 reported when she\ncompleted random video reviews and compared those reviews to\ndocumentation received, the bed check logs were accurate.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 5/22/24 in collaboration\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported he is not sure if he ever\nwrote down bed checks he didn’t complete in the past. However,\nhe stated since the video footage reviewed only showed he\ncompleted one check on 4/26/24, obviously he wrote down checks\nhe didn’t complete.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage of the boy’s hallway, girl’s hallway, and recreation\nroom from 4/26/24-4/27/24 were reviewed on 6/10/24.
