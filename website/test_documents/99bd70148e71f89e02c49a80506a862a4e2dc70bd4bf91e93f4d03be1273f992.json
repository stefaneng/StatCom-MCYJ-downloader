She said she observed four staff, three were not\nwearing masks and/or not wearing them appropriately. She said the male staff who\nallowed her to sign into the building was not wearing a mask at all. She said the\nmale staff who walked her to the conference room only put his mask on once he saw\nher but that the mask did not cover his nose. She said she observed a female staff\nwearing her mask around her neck. She said this female staff pull her mask up to\ncover her nose and mouth after she entered the hallway. She said she had received\nan email on September 14, 2020 informing her that there was COVID exposure in\nRose Hall and that all staff and residents were being tested. She said upon her\narrival she was told that all of the residents were tested again prior to her arrival.\nI interviewed Staff 1 regarding wearing a mask. She said she does not keep her\nmask on for the entire shift. She said she wear the mask but sometimes she has to\ntake it off so that she could breath.\nI interviewed Staff 2.

He said all staff were informed that a\nmask should be worn at all times. He said he had observed staff not wearing mask\nor not wearing them appropriately. He said the residents and staff at Rose Hall all\ntested negative for COVID. He provided this Consultant with Vista Maria’s\nprocedure on Mask wearing. He also said the facility policy states (with the caveat\nthat if you are alone in your office/workstation you can remove your mask.)\nVista Maria procedure on Mask wearing states that the policy will remain in effect\nuntil otherwise notified: “Employees are required to wear a mask that covers their\nnose and mouth while on campus. Masks are meant to stop the wearer from\nspreading respiratory droplets, remind people not to touch their faces and protect\nyou in instances where you come in contact with someone who is pre-symptomatic,\nor has COVID-19 or has symptoms that have yet to be diagnosed. Employees\nshould continue to practice social distancing while wearing the mask. Masks must be\n3",
    "worn while on campus. This includes while you are walking between buildings or\nwithin your building.”\nI interviewed another DHHS Worker who was on campus on 10/09/2020. She said\nall of the staff she observed in the building were not wearing masks. She said this\nwas not the first time she had observed the staff not wearing mask.
