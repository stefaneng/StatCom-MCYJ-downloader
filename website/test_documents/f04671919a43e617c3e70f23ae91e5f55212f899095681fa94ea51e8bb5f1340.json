Staff 3 never observed any inappropriate\nbehavior or touching by Staff 1. Staff 3 stated that Staff 1 would\nwalk through the unit and have brief conversations with the youth,\nbut did not spend much time there. Staff 3 recalled Staff 1 briefly\nsitting with Youth B when the youth was having a bad day. Staff 3\ndid not recall seeing anything inappropriate.\nMDHHS Worker was contacted by video call on 11/8/24. MDHHS\nWorker reported the facility agreed to a safety plan that they will\nnot have Staff 1 return to work until after he completes training\nregarding boundaries with residents. Staff 1 will also be shadowed\nby another supervisor for one week to ensure proper boundaries.\nVideo Review:\n• Evening of 9/6/24- to morning of 9/7/24: Staff 1 completed\nhis required checks with staff on the unit throughout the\nnight. Staff 1 did not have any contact with youth.\n4",
    "• 9/7/24 at 7:45PM Staff 1 sat on the couch talking with\nYouth B for about one minute. Youth A, Staff 2, and Staff 3\nwere present. Due to the camera angle, it could not be\ndetermined if Staff 1 touched Youth B’s leg.\n• Videos of the gym were reviewed and determined Staff 1\nwas not in the gym with youth at any time.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• There were no incident reports regarding this allegation.\n• Safety plan dated 9/13/24. Staff 1 was placed on\nadministrative leave until completion of the investigation.\n• The Human Resources file for Staff 1 was reviewed. Staff 1\nwas up to date on training. There was no disciplinary action\non file.\n• Timeclock punches were reviewed for Staff 1 and\ndetermined he worked on 9/6/24 from 6:25PM until 9:00AM\non 9/7/24. Staff 1 then worked 9/7/24 from 7:42PM-7:39AM\non 9/8/24.\nAnalysis Based on interviews with youth and staff, and review of video\nfootage, there is insufficient information to support this allegation.\nCONSULTATION:\nWhile no violation was found, consultation was offered that staff\nshould be mindful of how they interact with youth. Touching the\nyouth’s face or leg may feel too familiar or be interpreted by some\nyouth to be an inappropriate gesture and should be avoided. A\nrefresher training for staff may be beneficial.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
