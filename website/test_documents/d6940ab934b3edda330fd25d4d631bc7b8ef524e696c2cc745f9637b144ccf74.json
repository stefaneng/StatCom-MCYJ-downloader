    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nThe facility is working on defining the program within Leppien. There have been\nsome struggles to identify what the program is and working with the youth to help\nthem better understand the program. There are many new employees working at\nLeppien and currently the house supervisor position is being filled by the Quality\nManager. The position is posted with the hopes of hiring someone soon. Many of the\nyouth have on-campus jobs and are working toward independent living. Overall, the\nfeeling is the facility is moving forward and getting to where the program needs to be.\nInterviews\nYouth reported in interviews that at times the house can be filled with “drama.” Youth\nreported being involved in on campus jobs, going on outings off campus and overall\nhaving their needs met. Youth reported understanding the rules, having regular\ntherapy and not having concerns with staff. Staff reported the house being “hectic”\ndue to some behaviors between some of the youth. Staff stated they feel the youths’\nneeds are being met. Staff reported feeling supported and having the tools needed to\ncomplete their job successfully.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJuly 8, 2022\n_________________________________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 8, 2022\n___________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
