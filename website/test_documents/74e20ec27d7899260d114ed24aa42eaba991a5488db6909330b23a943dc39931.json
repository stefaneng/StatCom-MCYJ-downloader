    "A states this is the only physical altercation she has had with staff person 1 and has\nnot had any other physical altercation with staff. Resident A states she feels safe at\nMott Children Center.\nStaff person 1 states resident A was upset that she was directed to put her make up\nin the storage cubby. Staff person 1 states resident A said, “not taking my shit” and\ntook her make up bag to her bedroom. Staff person 1 states resident A was\nredirected to bring her make up back up front and when resident A did not comply\nstaff person 1 and 2 went to resident A’s bedroom. Staff person 1 states she\nreached for resident A’s make up bag on the window ledge and resident A used her\nfist and hit staff person 1 in the face. Staff person 1 states she grabbed resident A’s\narm to stop resident A from swinging and pushed resident A on to the bed. Staff\nperson 1 states she did not strike resident A. Staff person 1 states staff person 2\nsecured resident A and staff person 1 left the room. Staff person 1 states resident A\nwas not injured, but staff person 1 received a scratch on her stomach and lost an\nearring.\nStaff person 2 states resident A packed up her make up and took it to her bedroom\ninstead of placing it in her cubby located upfront on the unit. Staff person 1 states\nstaff person 1 and 2 walked down to resident A’s bedroom because resident A had\nglass make up bottles. Staff person 2 states staff person 1 reached for the make up\nbag on the window ledge and resident A hit staff person 1 in the face. Staff person 2\nstates resident A had stated “take my shit and I’m gonna swing.” Staff person 2\nstates staff person 1 put her hands up reflexively and it hit resident A in the chest\narea and then pushed resident A on to the bed. Staff person 2 states resident A hit\nstaff person 1 multiple times. Staff person 2 states she wrapped her arms around\nresident A and directed staff person 1 to leave the bedroom. Staff person 2 states\nresident A calmed down and she talked with resident A. Staff person 2 states she\ndid not observe any injuries to resident A or staff person 1. Staff person 2 wrote an\nincident report that matches her interview statements.\nResident A was seen by two Whaley Children Center – Mott Children Residence\nnurses on 05/29/2019. Each nurse wrote that resident A was observed with a dry,\ndiscolored area on her right posterior ankle and a faded bruise on her right upper\narm.\nStaff person 1 and 2’s personnel files were reviewed. Both are current in\nTherapeutic Crisis Intervention and do not have any disciplinary action regarding\nphysical management.\nThere is no video tape available for review because the incident occurred in resident\nA’s bedroom and the bedrooms are not equipped with cameras.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe discipline,\nincluding any of the following:\n(a) Any type of corporal punishment inflicted in any manner.\nANALYSIS: Resident A had glass make up bottles in her make up bag and\ntook the make up bag to her bedroom instead of putting it in her\ncubby upfront on the unit. Staff person 1 and 2 entered resident\nA’s room and staff person 2 reached for the make up bag on the\nwindow ledge. This prompted resident A to hit staff person 1 in\nthe face. Staff person 1 states she did not hit resident A, but\ngrabbed resident A’s arms and pushed resident A on to the bed.\nStaff person 2 states staff person 1 put her hands up reflexively\nand it hit resident A in the upper chest area and pushed resident\nA on to the bed.\nThis consultant finds after being hit by resident A, staff person 1\ndid not attempt to re-direct resident A, or request staff person 2\nto help with a two person hold. Instead staff person 1 grabbed\nresident A’s arms and pushed resident A on to the bed.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nCONSULTATION:\nThis consultant recommends Mott Children Residence administration consider\nestablishing policy and procedure of keeping resident bedroom doors locked during\nwaking hours.\n4",
