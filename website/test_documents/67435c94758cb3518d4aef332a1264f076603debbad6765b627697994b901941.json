It states sexual contact occurred between\nYouth A and B within the last two months at the facility.\n2",
    "I reviewed Doctor email to facility dated 02/16/2022. It states during a physical\nexam Youth A inquired about vaginal swab testing and disclosed having sexual\nencounters with Youth B during the previous two months at the facility.\nI interviewed Manager onsite on 03/01/2022. He reports Youth A being placed at\nthe facility on 10/11/2021, whereas Youth B was placed on 11/01/2021 in the girl’s\nnon-secure/New Beginnings (NB) unit and in separate bedrooms. Youth A and B\nwere consequently placed in the same bedroom from 01/11/2022 through\n01/22/2022 due to COVID quarantine. Youth A and B were taken out of quarantine\non 01/22/202 though remained roommates through 02/07/2022 when another\nbedroom was made available and the two no longer were roommates. Youth’s A\nand B were then placed in separate buildings on 02/16/2022 due to the allegations\nof this investigation.\nI interviewed Detective, via telephone, on 03/02/2022. He reports participating in a\nKids-Talk interview with Youth B on 02/28/2022. He reports the initial allegations\nnoted that the sexual contact between Youth A and B was consensual. Youth B\nwrote a letter to her teacher noting that Youth A, one time a month ago, pulled down\nYouth B’s pants while sleeping and humped her without any penetration. Youth B\nnotes that the incident was “between rounds”.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite on 03/02/2022. She reports one incident of sexual\ntouching occurring between her and Youth A approximately one month ago and that\nit did not last long, only a couple of minutes. She states being placed in room #9\nand that the incident occurred at approximately 10pm. She states staff walks by\nevery 15 minutes noting Staff Person 1 usually does the checks. She states Staff\nPerson 1 may have been doing the checks hourly though admits she may not have\nseen Staff Person 1 walk by.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite on 03/18/2022. She reports previously being COVID\nroommates with Youth B. She reports sexual touching occurring a few times the last\nmonth just after bedtime which could be 8:30pm or 9:30pm. She states they would\nengage in such behavior after staff would walk by their bedroom. She states staff\nwould walk by their bedroom every 10 to 15 minutes noting that staff would change\non different nights.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1, via telephone, on 03/22/2022. She reports having\nworked midnight shifts, and day shifts, when 15-minute bed checks would be\ncompleted. She reports the process of bed checks is to view inside resident\nbedrooms every 15 minutes and then turn the key-switch to notify the control room\nas a unit bed check being completed. She states that bed checks are not typically\nmissed though some may have occurred beyond 15 minutes due to issues occurring\nwith residents during the check. She cannot specifically recall when one of these\ninstances may have occurred. Staff Person 1 states she was made aware of the\nalleged inappropriate touching between Youths A and B and states she did not\n3",
    "observe the two engaged in any act while doing her checks, and states that it did not\noccur on her watch.\nI reviewed the facility’s Emergency Alarm System (Key and Phone Log) forms from\n01/11/2022 through 02/07/2022 for the times of 09:30PM through 07:00AM, which\nincludes the following building/unit: BTS, J-1 UP, J-1 DN, J-ll, NB, DELTA, and MP.\nThe form is used by the campus’ control room staff to document each\nbuilding’s/unit’s fifteen-minute checks of residents. It is reported that once staff on\nthe unit completes a bed-check they contact the control room through a key-check or\ncall-in who then enters an “X” on the form as verification of a check being done for\nthat for fifteen-minute period. An “0” means that a check was “Missed”, per the\nforms key.\nManager 1 reports the Emergency Alarm System (Key and Phone Log) form include\nall campus buildings/units.

Manager reports\nfifteen-minute checks of residents as occurring which could be verified through video\nmonitoring.\nI interviewed Manager 2 onsite on 03/02/2022. He reports no logging forms would\nhave occurred forms from 01/11/2022 through 02/07/2022 for the times between\n07:00AM and 09:30PM for Youth A and B while placed in quarantine in the same\nbedroom stating they were being checked on every 15 minutes by staff on the unit.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite on 03/18/2022. She states being transferred from the\ngirls non-secured unit to the girls secured unit recently.\nI interviewed Manager 1 onsite on 03/18/2022. He states Youth A being transferred\nfrom the girls non-secure, NB program (license #CE630201060) to the short-term\nsecure program (license #CE630201058) due to behavioral issues. No discharge\npaperwork had been completed upon Youth A’s discharge from the NB program and\nplacement in the more restrictive short-term secure program.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval\nchecks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: There is no conclusive evidence to indicate variable interval\nchecks of residents were not being performed on Youth A and B\nwhen they engaged in some form of sexual behavior. Youth A\nand B report staff making 15-minutes bed checks while they\nwere placed together.\nThere is evidence to indicate that variable interval checks of\nresidents do not occur every 15-minutes consistently. Review of\nthe facility’s Emergency Alarm System (Key and Phone Log)\nforms from 01/11/2022 through 02/07/2022 for the times of\n09:30PM through 07:00AM, to include building/units BTS, NB,\nand DELTA verifies missed or not documented bed checks as\noccurring.\nTECHNICAL The facility does not use the facility’s Emergency Alarm System\nASSSISTANCE: (Key and Phone Log) forms to document 15-minute checks of\nresidents in quarantine during daytime hours. The facility\nreports checks as occurring through normal programming on the\nunit during the day. It is recommended that the facility use its\nEmergency Alarm System (Key and Phone Log) form for all\nresidents in quarantine and out of the direct line of sight of staff\nto verify 15-minute checks as occurring.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4166 Discharge plan.\n(1) When a resident is discharged from institutional care, al\nof the following information shall be documented in the\ncase record with 14 days after discharge: (a) – (f)\nANALYSIS: Youth A was transferred from the girls non-secure, NB program\n(license #CE630201060) to the short-term secure program\n(license #CE630201058) due to behavioral issues. No\ndischarge paperwork had been completed upon Youth A’s\ndischarge from the NB program.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
