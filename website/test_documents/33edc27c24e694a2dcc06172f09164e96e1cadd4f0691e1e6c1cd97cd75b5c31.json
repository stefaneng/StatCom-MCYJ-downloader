    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12504 Eligibility Requirements\nSection (2) All of the following shall be in the case record before a youth is\nDescription placed in independent living:\n(c) That the youth’s social service worker has personally\nobserved and determined that the living situation is safe and that\nthe youth has a bed and has access to cooking and bathing\nfacilities.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth alleged being raped.\nInvestigation I interviewed Administrator 1 virtually on 04/05/2023.\nAdministrator 1 stated Youth A had truanted the facility in early\nMarch and was admitted to a hospital for psychiatric services\nbefore returning to the facility. Administrator 1 described Youth A\nsexually reactive at the hospital and Youth A reportedly made\nadvances to officers while at the hospital. Administrator 1 stated\nYouth A was briefly returned to the facility/program after being\ndischarged from the hospital. Administrator 1 stated the agency\nsubmitted a 30 notice for Youth A to be released from their\nprogram due to Youth A not being appropriate for their\nindependent living program and requiring more intensive mental\nhealth services. Administrator 1 stated the supervision of Youth A\nwas transferred to another agency, and Youth A was\nsubsequently placed with a grandparent.\nAdministrator 1 submitted incident reports dated 01/28/2023,\n02/13/2023, 02/28/2023, 03/01/2023, 03/16/2023, and other\ndocumentation related to Youth A's placement with their agency.\nThe additional information submitted included a staffing schedule,\nsafety plan for Youth A dated 3/14/2023, 30-day notice for the\nremoval of Youth A dated 03/10/2023, 5 incident reports, daily log\nnotes, and eight social work contacts from 03/06/2023 to\n04/03/2023. None of the information documented indicated Youth\nA could/would have been raped while at the facility. It was noted\nin a social work contact dated 4/03/2023 Youth A did report to\nFoster Care Worker 1 the allegation that Youth A was raped in\nFlint. This would have occurred during a truancy and not while at\nthe facility as the facility of Youth A's placement is not in Flint.\nOther social work contacts and information reviewed indicate\nYouth A reported both consensual and nonconsensual sexual\nactivity during a truancy. The closest identification provided by\n2",
    "Youth A was that Youth A was raped by a homeless man at an\nMTA bus station in Flint.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 by telephone on 05/15/2023\nand 05/23/2023. Foster Care Worker 1 stated Youth A was\nincarcerated for felonious assault. Foster Care Worker 1 saw\nYouth A on 05/16/2023 and reported Youth A did not provide any\nadditional information related to this allegation. Foster Care\nWorker 1 described Youth A as not being credible and requiring\nmore mental health services. Foster Care Worker 1 stated Youth\nA has a court hearing at a yet to be determined time. Foster Care\nWorker 1 stated Youth A's attorney was requesting Youth A have\na mental health evaluation to determine competency prior to\nYouth A's next court hearing.\nAnalysis The findings of this investigation do not support the allegation that\nYouth A was raped while at this facility. Youth A has a\ndocumented history of mental health disorders and possible\nsubstance abuse. There is the possibility that Youth A could have\nbeen raped by someone while Youth A was truant from the facility\nor that someone could have taken advantage of Youth A during\nYouth A's truancy due to Youth A's mental condition. However,\nthere is no evidence to suggest/support an allegation Youth A was\nraped by anyone associated with this independent living program.\nThere was nothing revealed in this investigation to indicate that\nthe youth’s living environment was not safe as required by the\nrule. Further upon determining that independent living was not the\nbest plan for this youth, the agency gave a 30-day notice and the\nyouth was replaced.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend the current license status of this child placing agency-private be\nmaintained.\n06/15/2023\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6/27/23\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
