    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 10/11/24, the medical team (Detroit Medical Center) had\nrestrained Youth A. During the restraint, unknown staff were\ntaking pictures and Youth A's genitals were exposed. Medical\nteam stated it was against the law to take \"child pornographic\"\nphotos.\nInvestigation On 10/14/24 and 12/17/24, I left a message for Complainant. I\ndid not receive a return phone call.\nOn 10/14/24, I spoke to Administrator. Administrator reported\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 were at the hospital with Youth A on 10/11/24.\nOn 10/28/24, I sent an email to DHHS Worker. No new\ninformation was provided.\nThe following interviews were conducted face to face at the facility\non 10/18/24:\nStaff 1 reported she worked at the hospital with Staff 2 on\n10/11/24. Staff 1 confirmed she sat in the hospital room with\nYouth A while he was there. Staff 1 reported Youth A continuously\nwas masturbating in the bed at the hospital while the staff were in\nthe room. Staff 1 reported they verbally redirected him, but he\ncontinued to masturbate. Staff 1 reported Youth A had his blanket\non the entire time but would grab Vaseline (that the nurses gave\nhim) and place this in his palm and start to masturbate under the\ncovers. Staff 1 reported she knew he was masturbating because\nof the sounds that he made while doing this and because the\nmovement of his hands and blanket. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 took\npictures on his phone to show the supervisor. Staff 1 reported this\nwas done to protect them from any allegations that may be made\ntowards them. Staff 1 reported she felt uncomfortable. Staff 1\nreported the pictures were not taken for sexual gratification or for\npurposes of pornography.\nStaff 2 reported he worked at the hospital with Staff 1 on\n10/11/24. Staff 2 confirmed he sat in the hospital room with Youth\nA while he was there. Staff 2 reported Youth A continuously was\nmasturbating in the bed at the hospital while the staff were in the\nroom. Staff 2 reported they verbally redirected him, but he\ncontinued to masturbate. Staff 2 reported he took a video of Youth\nA masturbating. Staff 2 reported a blanket was over Youth A and\n2",
    "you could not see any parts of his body other than the blanket\nmovement and hand. Staff 2 reported he did this to protect the\nstaff from any allegations. Staff 2 reported that because Youth A\nwould not stop, both Staff 1 and himself went out into the hallway\nand sat outside of his room. Staff 2 reported Supervisor 1 did not\ntell him to take pictures. Staff 2 reported the videos were not taken\nfor sexual gratification or for purposes of pornography.\nManager reported she received a text message from Staff 2 on\n10/11/24 stating that Youth A was masturbating in his bed at the\nhospital. Manager reported Staff 2 sent her two videos of Youth A\nmasturbating. Both were about three seconds long in length.\nManager reported that staff are not to take pictures of youth.\nManager reported she felt the videos and texts message were\nprovided to her to protect the staff at the hospital. Manager\nreported she did not feel the videos were taken for sexual\ngratification.\nYouth A reported he was at the hospital on 10/11/24 for\nattempting to hurt himself. Youth A reported Staff 1 and Staff 2\nwere there. Youth A reported he never felt uncomfortable with\nboth staff there. Youth A reported he didn’t see anyone taking\npictures/videos of him while at the hospital. Youth A reported he\nwas shackled to the bed and never masturbated in front of staff\nwhile at the hospital.\nVideo Reviewed:\nI watched the videos sent to Manager’s work phone from Staff 2’s\npersonal phone. The videos did not have times noted on them but\ndid show Youth A in the hospital, laying in his bed, under the\ncovers appearing to masturbate. Youth A’s body was not exposed\nin the videos or face. Videos were seconds long. Both videos have\nbeen since deleted from the phones.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Staff 1 and Staff 2 personnel files. Both trainings and\nclearances were up to date.\n• The Confidentiality Policy:\no Identifiable photographs, audio, and/or video-taping\nof Spectrum Consumers/Clients for use outside of\nservice delivery and/or client security/safety\nidentification purposes are prohibited. Uses within\nthe program include photographs for identification\npurposes, to procure permanency or as part of an\n3",
    "internal therapeutic activity. All photos for\nidentification and service delivery may be taken only\nby Spectrum Employees.\nAnalysis The agency is non-compliant with this rule. The agency’s policy on\nconfidentiality only allows for videotaping when it is to provide\nservices to a youth, identification purposes for security and safety\nto procure permanency, or internal therapeutic activities. Staff 1,\nStaff 2, and Manager reported the video was taken so that staff\nwere safe from any allegations that could be made against them.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIn interviews with Staff 1 and Staff 2, both reported no one\nprepared them for what supervision would be like at the hospital.\nBoth reported they were told at the beginning of their shift; they\nwere going to be at the hospital with Youth A. Staff 1 was hired on\n6/12/24 and Staff 2 was hired on 5/29/24. Both had less than six\nmonths experience working at the facility, and neither were\nprovided directions on how to staff a youth at a hospital. The\nagency does not have a policy for this situation. Supervision and\ntreatment of any youth is to be intentional and in accordance with\ntheir treatment plan in all settings. The agency is to provide their\nstaff with training and policies concerning their programming. Part\nof the services the agency will provide at times is supervision off-\nsite. The agency will need to write a policy pertaining to off-site\nsupervision.\nConsultation: It would be best practice for the agency to outline\nin their policy, items to be prepared for each youth before they go\noffsite. These may include, but are not limited to, obtaining a face\nsheet, calming plan, reason for offsite, supervision\nexpectations/goal, logging, and emergency contacts for staff.\nConclusion Violation Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n12/23/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
