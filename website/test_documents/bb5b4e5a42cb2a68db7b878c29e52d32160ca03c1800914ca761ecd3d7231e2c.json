    "3 of 10 total foster care case files reviewed (6 open FC, 2 closed FC, and 2 open IL)\ndid not contain all required action summaries completed within the required\ntimeframes. 2 of the 3 were closed files for which the action summaries can no\nlonger be uploaded and 1 was for an agency/placement change.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED previously cited as 722-09C\nInterim Inspection Report 11/2/21, CAP Approval 11/16/21\nRenewal Inspection Report 9/24/20, CAP Approval 10/14/20\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Two case contacts documenting foster home visits reviewed were blank and\nappeared to have been used as placeholders. These had been entered for longer\nthan the required 5 days with no narrative. Entering placeholders in order to meet\nentry timeframes does not meet the requirement.\n Social worker contacts regarding foster home visits must contain documentation\nof all required discussions outlined in policy.\n Several of the PATP's reviewed had the handwritten \"mailed\" on signature lines\nbut were not dated and no social work contacts were located documenting when\nthe documents were mailed. Additionally, the majority of the mailed PATP's were\nto case members who were actively participating and with whom regular face to\nface contacts were being made. Documents must only be mailed as an exception\nwhen circumstances prevent obtaining physical signatures. The documents\nrequiring signatures (parent/caregiver/youth) must be explained to the signing\nparty. It appears that the majority of missing signature documents were mailed a\nweek prior to the inspection and, in several cases, the individuals to whom the\ndocuments were mailed were actively participating in the case and with whom\nregular face to face contacts were being made.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n Foster Home Visit case contacts do not have all participants linked. The\nparticipants must be linked to the contact to accurately identify who was present.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe one CAP submitted by the agency was in response to the 11/2/2021 interim\nlicensing inspection report and was approved on 11/16/2021. That CAP addressed\n9",
    "15 violations and was successful in achieving compliance in 9 of the 15 areas. Six\nviolations addressed in that CAP were repeated violations during this inspection and\nwill required additional corrective action planning.\nChief Administrator Assessment – The chief administrator assessment was\nreceived prior to the inspection and discussed during the entrance meeting. The chief\nadministrator accurately identified areas that needed improvement and discussed\nplans the agency has already identified in order to improve compliance.\nInterviews – The staff members interviewed all reported no concerns other than\nbeing fairly new to their roles and still learning all of the requirements.\nVII. DCWL Analyst Concerns\nNo safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\nSeptember 9, 2022\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 12, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
