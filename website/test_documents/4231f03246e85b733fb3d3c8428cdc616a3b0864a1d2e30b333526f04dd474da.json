During a restraint staff were leaning on the youth’s\nstomach/side.\nInvestigation Allegation 1\nA complaint was received on 4/4/23 that alleged staff would put\nsocks in the youth’s mouth during restraints if they would yell or\nscream.\nThis complaint came in after all youth had moved from the facility\nand staff were either transferred to another license or laid off. All\ninterviews included a DHHS Worker unless otherwise noted.\nInterviews\n6",
    "Contact was made with the complainant on 4/5/2023 and she did\nnot have any additional information to share.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at her current\nplacement on 4/6/23. Courtesy DHHS Worker 1 was also\npresent. Youth A stated she was previously at Vassar House and\nit is a horrible place. Staff sat there and did not do anything. Youth\nA was in a restraint on her first day but no other restraints. She\nwitnessed a restraint with Youth B completed by Staff 1, Staff 2,\nand Staff 3. Prior to the restraint Youth B and Youth C were trying\nto fight. The staff had the other girls leave the unit as Youth B\ncontinued to act out. When the girls returned to the unit Youth B\ncontinued to act out, flipped over furniture and took her shirt off.\nYouth A was sitting on her bed when Youth B was restrained near\nYouth A's bed. The staff put a shirt over Youth B's head. Staff 6\ntold the staff restraining Youth B to put a shirt in Youth A's mouth.\nYouth A could not recall what day this occurred. Youth B was face\nup on the floor with Staff 1 and Staff 2 holding her arms and Staff\n3 on the legs. Staff 6 said to put the shirt over Youth B’s head but\nStaff 4 corrected him and said the shirt could only be placed in the\nmouth. Youth B was restrained multiple times that night, but this\nwas the only restraint Youth A saw. Youth D, Youth E, Youth F,\nYouth G, and Youth H were also present for the restraint. During\nthe restraint Youth B was spitting and trying to bite. This is why\nthe staff put the shirt in her mouth. Youth B tried to talk to them\nwhile the shirt was in her mouth. She was telling the staff to take\nthe shirt out of her mouth. Youth A reported she felt that the staff\nat the facility took their anger out on the kids. She never told\nanyone staff put socks in the youth’s mouths during restraints.\nYouth A reported the Chief Administrator (CA) had met with the\ngirls and provided them with the rules of restraints saying the staff\ncould put a shirt in the girls’ mouths if they were spitting or biting\nwhile in a restraint.\nYouth B was initially interviewed by Courtesy DHHS Worker 2\nwho did not include this consultant in the interview on\n4/11/23. The courtesy worker provided her notes. Youth B told the\ncourtesy worker that she did not know Staff 6’s first name but\nconfirmed it was a male staff who had injured his ACL and at one\npoint was working at the booth due to this injury.\nYouth B was again interviewed this time it was conducted face to\nface at her current placement on 4/13/23 by this consultant. An\nattempt was made to connect the DHHS Worker by phone, but it\nwas unsuccessful. Youth B was accompanied by one of the\ndetention guards. She was asked about her time at the facility.\n7",
    "She stated she was \"bad\" and had a lot of restraints while at the\nfacility. She was asked if staff ever put a shirt in her mouth or on\nher face and she stated the staff did put a shirt on her mouth but\nnot in it. She could not recall the staff who did this. The entire unit\nwas present including Youth A. The restraint occurred right in front\nof Youth A's bed and Youth A was standing right there. She said\nthe staff put a T-shirt on her face then she ripped the t-shirt and\nthey put a mask over her mouth, but she ripped that too. She said\nstaff did this because she was spitting, and they did not have a\nspit shield. The staff usually use a mask when they are spitting\nduring a restraint, but all the staff were holding her and none of\nthem could leave to get a mask. It took all the staff to restrain her\nbecause she fought in the restraint. She said the shirt was just\ncovering her mouth not her entire head. She did not have any\nconcerns with the restraint.\nYouth B did have concerns with a restraint that was completed on\nYouth I. The staff holding Youth I were \"messing\" her up. Youth I\nwas not supposed to be in a restraint because she had Asthma.\nThe staff put a shirt over Youth I's mouth making it hard for her to\nbreath. Staff 6 was holding onto Youth I's legs until a female staff\ncould switch with him because male staff are not to hold the legs.\nYouth C and Youth L were the only other youth in Unit 1 at the\ntime of the incident with Youth I. Youth B stated Staff 10 placed\nthe shirt over Youth I’s head. Staff 4 told Staff 10 she could not put\na shirt over Youth I's face. Youth B stated CA never talked to the\ngirls about staff being allowed to put things in their mouth during\nrestraints. She said he did have a talk with all the girls about\nrestraints but that was not something he talked about.\nAccording to the DHHS Worker Youth C refused to be\ninterviewed for any investigation.\nYouth K was interviewed face to face at her current\nplacement on 4/17/23 along with Courtesy DHHS Worker 1.\nYouth K reported that her and Youth I got into a fight. Youth I was\nrestrained. While Youth I was in the hold the staff pulled her shirt\nup over her mouth because she was spitting. Staff 4 was covering\nYouth I's mouth with the shirt. Youth I was saying she could not\nbreath. Youth I was in restraint after restraint that day.\nAn interview was attempted with Youth F at the home of a\nfriend on 5/10/23 but she refused to be interviewed.\nYouth I was interviewed face to face at her home on 4/18/23\nalong with Courtesy DHHS Worker 3. She reported she was\n8",
    "restrained a couple of times while at the facility. She was\nrestrained one time by Staff 6 and Staff 10 in a standing hold. She\nasked Staff 6 to call Staff 4. Youth I and Staff 6 argued about it.\nYouth I threatened to spit on Staff 6, so he called Staff 4 for a spit\nmask. Youth I said she was spitting but not on him. Staff 4 could\nnot find a spit mask. Staff 6 asked Staff 4 if they could cover her\nmouth and Staff 4 said he could. Staff 6 pulled Youth I's t-shirt and\nsweatshirt up over her entire head. Staff 4 said that the shirts\ncould only be over Youth I's mouth so Staff 25 pulled Youth I’s\nshirt down. Youth I's head was covered in the time it took Staff 4\nto walk from the front door to the bathroom. When Staff 4 noticed\nwhat Staff 6 had done she quickly made her way over to them by\nthe bathroom. Youth I said she could breathe while the shirts were\nover her mouth. She reported if there is no spit mask then the staff\ncan cover their mouth but cannot cover their nose. Youth I said\nshe was told the staff could do this for their safety. Youth I stated\nshe did not know who told her but stated it was not CA. Youth I\nreported she does not have asthma but does have breathing\nproblems.\nYouth D was interviewed face to face at her school on\n4/26/23. Youth D stated she was never restrained while at the\nfacility. She did, however, witness restraints. One time Youth D\nheard Youth B was trying to bite the staff, so the staff put a t-shirt\nin Youth B's mouth. Youth D did not see this occur she just heard\nstaff say to put a t-shirt in Youth B's mouth. She did not know\nwhich staff said this.\nYouth H was interviewed face to face at her current\nplacement on 4/27/23. Youth H reported the staff at the facility\nwere rude and only there for the money. The restraints were\nhorrible and not done right. One time Youth B was restrained by\nStaff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 8. While in the restraint the staff put a\nshirt over Youth B's face. Youth H thought it was Staff 1, but she\nwas not sure who put the shirt over Youth B's face. Youth H knew\nthey did this because she could see the shirt on youth B's face.\nYouth H thought Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 7, Staff 8, and Staff\n22 were present for this restraint with Youth B. Youth H said this\nrestraint occurred by her personal isle (P isle) that she shared with\nYouth A. She said Staff 1 was present for the restraint but\nswitched out with Staff 8.\nYouth H reported she saw staff shove socks in Youth O's mouth\nduring a restraint because Youth O was spitting. Youth H said\nYouth O was naked at the time and tried to drink soap. That is\n9",
    "when the staff restrained her. Youth H said this happened in\nDecember. She did not know which staff did this.\nYouth O was interviewed face to face at her current\nplacement by Courtesy DHHS Worker 7 on 5/3/23 (This\nconsultant participated by phone) and again by video\nconferencing on 6/29/23. Youth O said prior to her current\nplacement she was at the facility from 11/22/22 to 3/8/23. She\nreported when she would run the staff would restrain her. She said\nthe staff would hold her shirt over her nose. She told the staff she\ncould not breath, but they would not do anything. She said she\nwould hyperventilate and would spit up. Staff thought she was\nspitting at them so they would keep her mouth covered. Youth O\nreported this was only done with her and none of the other girls.\nThe staff never used anything except her shirt to cover her mouth.\nShe said this happened about 6 times. The last time it happened\nwas 3/6/23 with Staff 4, Staff 5, and Staff 13. She said Staff 4\ncovered her mouth. She did tell them she could not breath. She\nstated nothing else besides a shirt was used for this. Nothing was\nplaced inside her mouth and no sock was used. She said it\nhappened between 4 and 6pm in the parking lot. The staff would\nnot use a spit mask on her because she would bite through the\nmask.\nYouth E was interviewed face to face at her school on 5/19/23\nby Courtesy DHHS Worker 6. This consultant participated in the\ninterview by phone. Youth E stated staff at the facility did\nrestraints properly. She never saw staff put socks in any of the\ngirls mouths while they were in restraints. Youth B pulled her own\nshirt up over her head and staff would try to get it off due to self-\nharm. Then the staff would restrain Youth B. She never saw a\nstaff put a shirt over a youth's face during a restraint. The staff at\nthe facility would never do that. All the staff at the facility are\nsweet.\nYouth L was interviewed face to face at her current placement\non 5/24/23. Youth L stated she was never restrained while at the\nfacility. She did, however, witness many restraints. She witnessed\na restraint with Youth I that lasted hours because she would not\ncalm down. Youth I would spit at the staff. They would use a spit\nmask when they could but during this incident, they did not have\none so they pulled her shirt collar up over her face. The staff were\nnot supposed to cover Youth I's entire face but just her mouth.\nThe new staff put her shirt over her head. The new staff was a guy\nwho had torn his ACL. Youth I told him he could not cover her\nface. Youth L said she was sleeping when the hold ended. She\n10",
    "did not see any other restraint in which a shirt was put over a\nyouth's face. When she did see it with Youth I it was not on her\nface very long. Youth I did say she could not breath when her\nmouth was covered. Staff 11 came in and told them to remove the\nshirt from her face and said it could only be over her mouth. Youth\nL did not see anything concerning about Youth B's restraints. She\nnever saw anything over Youth B's face or placed in the mouth\nduring restraints.\nYouth P was interviewed face to face at her school on 5/31/23.\nYouth P saw a restraint with Youth I. Youth I fought Youth K. Staff\n11, Staff 2, Staff 19, and Staff 21 were present. Youth I said she\nwas unsure who else was involved. This took place in unit 4.\nYouth I was talking about Youth K. Youth K was on her bed and\nlooked to be sleeping. Youth I got up out of a chair and Youth K\ngot up also. Youth I threw a punch and Youth K fought back. They\nwere punching and kicking each other and pulled each other’s\nhair. A couple of supervisors came in and restrained Youth I.\nYouth P was not sure who the staff or supervisors were. Youth P\nnever saw staff put anything over or in Youth I's mouth. The staff\nhad a mesh bag that could go over their head but she never saw it\nused. Another peer said it was a spit bag. Youth P saw other\nrestraints with Youth I. Youth P could not always see around the\nstaff. Youth I was on her back with staff leaning over her on each\nof her sides.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/21/23.\nStaff 2 stated she is a first shift youth care worker. She has\nworked at the facility since December of 2021. She reported she\nwas involved in a few restraints with Youth B. All of the restraints\nwith Youth B were similar. Youth B would be tearing up the unit\nthen she would be put in a restraint when she started to become\naggressive with staff. She would first be put in a standing hold, but\nshe would fight so she would be transitioned to a team restraint.\nThe standing hold would be with 2 staff and a supervisor\nwatching. The team restraint would be three people with 2 staff on\narms and one on legs. Staff 2 was unsure if Youth B ever spit or if\nanything was ever used to deter spitting. She stated nothing was\never placed in Youth B's mouth. Youth B would not fight when in\nthe team restraint because she was more secure.\nStaff 2 reported Youth O was a spitter and she did spit on Staff 2.\nAll she could do about it was to move out of the way when Youth\nO would spit. They did not have spit guards so there was nothing\nthat could be done. They were never told or were allowed to use\nanything but a spit shield to block spitting. They never had spit\n11",
    "shields on hand. She would just back up or turn her head away.\nOther staff did the same thing. No shirts or socks were ever used\nto block spitting and nothing placed in the mouth.\nStaff 2 said she was never involved in a restraint of Youth I.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/21/23.\nShe stated if the youth spit it is only when they are in a restraint.\nWhen doing a restraint there are 2 people on the arms and one on\nthe legs. Staff 5 said they did have spit guards, but the staff did\nnot carry them on them. They no longer order the spit guards. She\ndid not know why. They were not advised to use anything else. All\nthey could do was redirect the youth and position themselves, so\nthey didn’t get spit on. They were never told they could place\nitems over or in the mouth. She never saw a staff place a sock in\na youth’s mouth and she never observed a staff placing a shirt\nover a youths face or mouth. She reported nothing was used to\nblock spit.\nStaff 9 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/21/23.\nStaff 9 said when youth spit during a restraint staff would use\npaper or pull the youths shirt up away from the youth’s face to\nblock the spit until they could get a spit mask.

They would switch out with each\nother throughout the restraints. Staff 3 did not want to be spit on\nas it makes her vomit. Youth B knew Staff 3 did not like spit so\nshe would not spit on her. She did not need a spit guard. Another\ntime Youth B tried to spit and they pulled her shirt up over her\nmouth. Staff 3 was in the room at the time but was not helping\nwith the hold. This was the same day as the other restraints she\n12",
    "mentioned. Other youth were on the unit during the restraints that\ntook place there. Staff 3 thought Youth F, Youth H, Youth L, and\nYouth C were all present. Staff 3 reported no one put anything in\nYouth B's mouth. They just pulled her shirt up to her lips. They did\nnot have a spit guard, so they used the collar of Youth B's shirt.\nShe never saw anyone put anything in Youth B's mouth. Staff 3\nsaid she does not usually encounter spit, so no one knew where\nthe spit guards were. She has never even seen one. Youth B was\nthe only youth she ever saw spit. She heard of others but was not\npresent.\nStaff 3 stated she was not involved in any restraints with Youth I.\nStaff 19 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/21/23.\nStaff 19 said she was present for a restraint with Youth I on\nValentines Day. The other staff involved were Staff 4, Staff 11,\nand a lady that got laid off whose name she could not recall. Staff\n19 and this lady were the staff working the unit. Staff 4 and Staff\n11 were supervisors that were on that day. The only time Youth I\nwas spitting was when she was trying to spit on Youth K. The\nyouth had previously been told spitting was not an assault. Youth I\ndid not spit on staff. No shirt was ever placed over Youth I's mouth\nwhen Staff 19 was there.\nStaff 19 said she never participated in a restraint with Youth B and\nshe never saw any other youth spit.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face to face by the DHHS Worker on\n7/7/23. This consultant participated by phone. Staff 6 said he was\nnot at the facility for very long as he had just returned from having\na torn ACL. Staff 6 said he did not recall Youth I. He said he was a\nsupervisor while at the facility. He stated the supervisor’s role was\nto monitor things; however, he doesn’t recall anything specifically.\nHe stated he was so new there that he didn’t recall names. Staff 6\nwas asked about being present for or involved in any restraints\nwhen youth were spitting. He stated he recalls hearing people\nover the walkie talkie asking for a spit mask to be brought but\ndoesn’t recall being physically present. Staff 6 stated the spit\nguards were kept in a back pocket or the med room. He stated\nthey were to use these for spitting, but sometimes they weren’t\navailable so they would just have to deal with it. Staff 6 denied\nbeing present for or involved in any times when a shirt or any\nother item was used to block spitting. Staff 6 denied being\ninvolved in any restraints of Youth B.\n13",
    "Staff 8 was interviewed by three-way phone call on 7/27/23.\nHe reported he was at the facility for about a year as the trainer,\nbut he did many other things as well. He does recall being present\nfor restraints with Youth B. He was probably there for about three\nor four of her restraints. He knows of at least one of those\nrestraints involved both Staff 1 and Staff 2. He could remember\nthe day but could not remember the sequence of events. He\nknows she was restrained but was unsure how many times and\nwho was all involved. Youth B was spitting during this incident.\nStaff 8 said when youth would spit they would either get a spit\nguard or hold something in front of the staff's face. Youth B\nregularly spit in restraints and on this day they used her shirt to\nblock the spit. He could not recall the staff that did this. He stated\nthe shirt was about 6-8 inches away from Youth B's face and not\nrestricting her breathing. He reported Youth B had double layers\non so they pulled her top shirt up to block the spit, but the shirt\nwas never over her mouth. He never saw any staff put anything in\nor on Youth B's mouth. The spit guards could be gotten by a\nsupervisor. They were kept in the supervisor’s office or the\nprogram managers office. Their restraint training Therapeutic\nCrisis Intervention (TCI) did not teach anything about spit guards.\nThe facility put this into practice and trained it themselves. The\nstaff were never taught to place anything over a youth’s mouth\nother than the spit guard. CA never told them they could use a\nshirt over the face when a youth spit. CA would never allow that.\nStaff 8 said he never saw Staff 6 in a restraint with Youth B or\nYouth I.\nStaff 14 was interviewed on 7/27/23 by three-way phone call.\nShe was involved in restraints with Youth B on one particular day\nshe was being restrained all day. There were lots of people in and\nout dealing with her. Staff 2 was there. Youth B was spitting on\neveryone except Staff 14. They did not have a spit mask, so staff\nwere just turning away from her. They did not use a shirt or socks\nto block the spit. She was there almost the entire time and did not\nsee that.\nStaff 10 was interviewed via three-way phone call on 8/1/23.\nStaff 10 said she was not working at the facility for very long. Staff\n10 did remember a restraint with Youth I. She could not recall the\nstaff's names that were there. She said there was a male\nmanager. She reported Youth I was in a team restraint and was\nspitting. The male manager had a COVID mask he was holding\nover her face but a few inches away from her mouth. She said the\nmanager was an African American male who had left the facility\nthen came back to work. Staff 10 thought the restraint had been\n14",
    "going on prior to her getting to the unit. A female manager was\nholding Youth I's feet, a Hispanic lady was holding one arm and\nStaff 10 on the other arm. The male manager was kneeling on the\nfloor holding the mask over Youth I. Staff 10 said Youth I did have\na shirt over her mouth prior to the mask. They used the collar of\nYouth I's shirt. The male manager was the one to put her shirt\nover her to block her spit. Staff 10 said the shirt was not touching\nYouth I's mouth. Staff 10 denied ever pulling a shirt over Youth I's\nmouth. Staff 10 stated she was not present for any other youth\nthat spit during restraints. Staff 10 stated during restraint training\nthey were taught about a specific mask that could be used for\nspitting. There was nothing said in the training about placing items\nin or on the youth’s mouth.\nStaff 25 was interviewed by three-way phone call on 8/25/23.\nStaff 25 said she no longer works for the agency. She was only\nthere about three to four months. Staff 25 was involved in multiple\nrestraints with Youth I. During the restraint Youth I was kicking\nand spitting. They used Youth I’s top shirt to block the spit. The\nshirt collar was pulled up over Youth I's mouth. She said the collar\nof the shirt was touching Youth I's mouth for about a minute.\nYouth I's nose was not covered. Youth I could breathe as\nindicated by her talking to Staff 25. Staff 4 told Staff 25 usually\nthey would have something to put over the youth’s head but the\nonly thing they had this night was Youth I's shirt. She could not\nrecall who was holding Youth I's shirt. Staff 6 was gone by this\ntime. Each time it was removed Youth I would spit again so they\nwould put it back up. Staff 25 said at one point she did hold Youth\nI’s shirt up to block the spit, but the shirt was not touching Youth\nI's mouth. Staff 25 said she did not know how to deal with the\nspitting, so she relied on the senior staff to guide her.\nStaff 11 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/27/23.\nStaff 11 said he was a supervisor at the facility. While working at\nthe facility Staff 11 dealt with Youth I one time but it was multiple\nrestraints. He reported if a youth spits while in a restraint the staff\ncan put a spit guard on. Staff can also remove themselves if they\nare being targeted, and they can move their body to face away\nfrom the youth. Youth I did threaten to spit on Staff 19. Nothing\nwas ever used to cover Youth I's mouth. Staff 11 said he has\nnever seen any staff put anything in or over a youth’s mouth.\nMultiple attempts were made to get a hold of Staff 7; however\nher phone was disconnected and she no longer works at the\nfacility.\n15",
    "Staff 4 was interviewed by three-way phone call on 8/14/23.\nShe reported when she worked at the facility, she was a\nsupervisor. Staff 4 stated she was in a restraint with Youth I\nmultiple times in the same day. Staff 6 was present and was\nassisting with the restraints. Staff 6 was either holding Youth I's\nlegs or her hands while she was on the floor. Staff 4 said she\ncould not remember the other staff who were present, nor could\nshe remember if Youth I was spitting. Staff 4 reported if a youth\ndoes spit they will put a shirt up to block the spit but make sure the\nshirt is not touching the youths mouth. She said they pull the collar\nof the youth’s shirt up. Only a female staff would have done this so\nthe youth would not claim sexual harassment. She did not\nremember telling Staff 6 to put a shirt over Youth I's mouth. Staff 4\ndid not recall Youth I saying she could not breath while in the\nrestraints. If Youth I did say she could not breath it would have\nbeen when her mouth was covered because she would have\nwanted it uncovered so she could spit. Staff 4 stated Staff 6 did\nnot work at the facility for very long but when he did, he was good\nand knew how to talk to the kids. Staff 4 never heard of anything\never being put in a youth’s mouth when they were spitting. She\nsaid the facility had spit guards and if they did not have spit\nguards, they would use the youth’s shirt. The shirt would be pulled\noutward, so it was not touching the youth’s mouth. She stated they\nused to put the shirts directly on the youth’s mouth but that was\nsomething that was corrected before Youth I ever had to be\nrestrained. She never saw any staff place a shirt directly over a\nyouth’s mouth.\nStaff 21 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/27/23.\nIn regards to the incident with Youth I, Staff 21 stated she was at\nthe facility until 2:30am to help out with Youth I but other units\nwere having issues as well. Staff 21 said she was not involved in\nany restraints that night. She could not remember the staff that\nwere working. She did see a restraint with Youth I but could not\nrecall if Staff 6 was there. Youth I was spitting and staff would\nredirect her and turn away from her so they would not get spit on.\nShe did not recall any item being used to shield the spit. She did\nnot see a shirt get put over Youth I's mouth. Staff 21 said they\nused to have spit guards and could call for someone to get them.\nThey ran out and never got more. When youth spit the staff will\nlook away or put staff’s own shirt up over their face. Staff 21 said\nshe never saw anyone use a youth’s shirt to cover the youth’s\nmouth. She also never saw anyone put socks in a youth’s mouth.\nStaff 28 was interviewed by three-way phone call on 9/20/23.\nShe reported she is no longer employed at the facility, but while\n16",
    "she was there, she worked third shift. Staff 28 could not recall\nYouth I's name but when the incident report was referred to, she\nremembered the incident. Staff 28 said she was called in to relieve\nsomeone who was already in a restraint with Youth I. Staff 28 said\nYouth I was in a restraint when she got to the unit, so she took\nover on Youth I’s right arm. She could not recall who she took\nover for. That person took Youth I's shirt collar and placed it over\nYouth I's mouth. The staff who did this wrapped their thumb in the\nshirt so they would not be skin to skin then held the shirt to Youth\nI's upper lip. Staff 28 said the shirt was there for less than 10\nseconds when Youth I would stop spitting it was removed then put\nback up when she would spit again. Youth I did not say she could\nnot breath while Staff 28 was there. She said nothing was placed\nin Youth I's mouth. She also said a spit guard was not used. Staff\n28 stated they were told in training they could cover the youth’s\nmouth with their shirt collar. They were taught to do it just as the\nlady dealing with Youth I did it. Staff 28 could not remember who\ndid the training.\nAllegation 2\nDuring her interview Youth B stated Staff 6 pulled Youth I's legs\nout in front of her in order to get her down onto the floor. She\nreported this restraint took place in Unit 1 by the bathroom. Youth\nI was being unsafe by trying to take a piece of metal from a mask\ninto the bathroom with her. Youth B reported Youth I was\nscreaming and crying in pain during the restraint.\nDuring Staff 10’s interview she reported the male manager did\npull down on Youth I's feet because Youth I was kicking, and they\nwere trying to get her down into a restraint. He did not do this\nforcefully.\nYouth I reported, on the day she was restrained she tried to run.\nYouth I was put in a standing hold. Staff 6's leg was hurt, and he\nsaid he did not want her to struggle so they took Youth I to the\nground. Staff 6 first tried to get Youth I to the ground by sweeping\nher legs with his legs but because his leg hurt, he was unable to.\nHe then wrapped his arm around her legs and lifted them. Youth I\nlanded on her back on the floor. Staff 10 and Staff 25 held onto\nYouth I's arms. Staff 6 held onto Youth I's ankles. Staff 6 was\ngetting more and more upset because his leg hurt. Staff 6 pushed\ndown on Youth I's feet, so she kicked him.\nDuring Youth L’s interview she stated a supervisor, Staff 11, was\npresent during the restraint she saw with Youth I. She said he was\nthe person who told the staff to take Youth I down to the ground.\n17",
    "The new guy, whose name she could not remember, pulled Youth\nI's legs out from under her in order to get her on her back. Youth L\nsaid Youth I was pulled down aggressively. Youth L heard Youth\nI's body hit the floor. She did not think Youth I got hurt from the\nrestraint.\nDuring Staff 6’s interview he did not recall ever being involved in\na restraint with Youth I.\nDuring Staff 25’s interview she stated during the restraint with\nYouth I Staff 6 did grab Youth I's legs to help guide her to the floor\nduring the restraint. She reported he did this how it is trained. She\nstated Staff 4 and Staff 7 were also present and a blond lady she\ncould not name. When Staff 6 grabbed Youth I's legs there were\ntwo female staff on her arms. Staff 6 grabbed her legs toward the\nankles to get Youth I to stop kicking. Staff 6 was not aggressive.\nStaff 11 reported when he was dealing with Youth I’s behaviors,\nshe was upset due to being on another unit. Youth I got into it with\nYouth K. Youth K calmed down when he came into the unit, but\nYouth I was still upset, running around the unit and jumping over\nfurniture. He and Staff 19 held Youth I then Staff 19 switched out\nwith the other female staff. Youth I tried to leave the unit again, so\nshe was placed in a team restraint that involved him, Staff 4, Staff\n19, Staff 27, and Staff 28. He said he was holding one of her arms\nat first, but they would all rotate to different positions throughout\nthe restraint. Staff 11 was not sure who else was helping with the\nrestraint. Youth I then calmed down and was released. Once\nreleased Youth I then tried to run again and was placed in a\nstanding hold. Staff 11 stated he could not recall any other male\nstaff being present. He did state that none of the staff used\nexcessive force or were aggressive with Youth I. During the team\nrestraint the staff step down in order to get the youth down to the\nground. He stated there was one other team restraint done on\nYouth I because she was pushing and hitting staff. He could not\nrecall who all was involved and again they rotate out of the\nrestraint to give people breaks. Everything finally ended when\nYouth I said she would go to bed and take her medication.\nStaff 4 did not recall Staff 6 pulling on Youth I’s legs during the\nrestraints that occurred.\nIn her account of the incidents with Youth I Staff 19 said only her,\nStaff 4, and Staff 23 were involved in the restraints with Youth I.\n18",
    "Multiple attempts were made to contact Staff 7. Messages were\nleft for her, but she did not return the calls.\nAllegation 3\nDuring Youth K’s interview she reported she was at the facility\nfrom October 26 - March 14. She reported she saw a restraint with\nYouth B. Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 10 were there. It occurred in\nUnit 2. Youth B was going to run out the back door when she was\nrestrained. Staff 2 was leaning on Youth B during the restraint.\nStaff 2's elbow was on Youth B's stomach. Staff 3 had Youth B's\nlegs and Staff 10 had Youth B's other arm.\nDuring Staff 3’s interview the restraints she was involved in with\nYouth B she was not paying attention to what other staff were\ndoing. Youth B never said anyone had an elbow on her side or\nstomach. This would be impossible as staff are not positioned\nnear the youth’s stomach. They had to do the restraint correctly\nwith Youth B because she was strong.\nDuring their interviews Staff 4, Staff 8, and Staff 14 all stated\nthey did not see anyone lean on Youth B during her restraints.\nStaff 2 reported while she was assisting with Youth B’s restraint,\nshe was always holding Youth B's arms. In a team restraint the\nstaff cannot lean on the youth’s stomach. Staff 2 said she was\nnever on Youth B's stomach nor was any other staff.\nStaff 1 reported she never saw a staff lean into Youth B's\nstomach. She clarified that is not something that could happen.\nThe staff’s bodies when in restraints are not positioned next to the\nyouth’s side so they could not be leaning on the youth.\nStaff 10 reported she did not see anyone do anything out of line\nduring the restraint nor did she see Youth I get hurt in any way.\nYouth L reported during the restraint with Youth I that she\nwitnessed the staff holding her put their knees on her arms to\nkeep them down on the floor. She stated she thought the staff\nwere Staff 2, a tall heavy-set man, and Staff 21. Staff 21 was not\nrestraining Youth I but observing. This occurred during the night\nand the rest of the youth received snacks. The guy was holding\nYouth I's legs and Staff 2 on the arms. She said she thought it was\nStaff 2 because it sounded like her, but she only saw the back of\nher. Youth L also thought Staff 4 was there. Every staff restraining\nYouth I put their knees on her arms. The staff put their legs on\n19",
    "Youth I's arms because she was hitting the staff. Youth I did say\nher arms hurt and she was tired afterwards.\nDuring Youth I’s interview she did not report that any staff had\ntheir knees on her arms or any part of her body.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• A search of MiSACWIS incident reports for Youth O did not\nfind any incidents for 3/6/23. There was an incident on\n3/1/23 that took place outside. Youth O was spiting, but the\nreport did not indicate staff placing anything over Youth O’s\nmouth. Another incident occurred on 3/7/23. During this\nincident Youth O was spitting and staff placed a spit mask\non her.\n• All restraint reports involving Youth B were reviewed in\nMiSACWIS. The incident that occurred on 2/24/23 seemed\nto fit the description provided by all interviewees. This\nreport indicated that Youth B was restrained multiple times\nfor self-harmful and aggressive behavior. There was\nnothing in the report about Youth B spitting but it did\nindicate Youth B was trying to put a shirt around her neck.\nThere is also nothing in the reports to indicate staff were\nleaning on Youth B during the restraint. The report\nindicated Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 7, and Staff 8\nwere all involved in these restraints.\n• Three Restraint reports were reviewed for Youth I that fit\nthe description provided by the interviewees.\n1. On 2/12/23 at 7:44pm Youth I was restrained several\ntimes for constantly trying to exit the unit by pushing\nthrough staff. At one point Youth I stood on a table to try\nand jump over staff in order to get to the exit. The report\nindicated Staff 4, Staff 7, and Staff 25 were involved in\nthese restraints.\n2. On 2/12/23 at 9:20pm Youth I continued the behaviors\nnoted in the previous incident report. It was reported\nthat Youth I threatened to spit so a spit mask was\nutilized. The report indicated Staff 4, Staff 7, Staff 25,\nand Staff 29 were involved in these restraints. The\nfacility’s restraint report indicated a staff with the last\nname that could have indicated Staff 5 or Staff 6. The\nMiSACWIS report lists Staff 4, Staff 7, Staff 10, and\nStaff 25.\n3. On 2/14/23 at 11:03 PM Youth I jumped over a table\nand ran out the back door. Staff talked to Youth I for a\nwhile outside before she agreed to enter the unit. Once\nshe did, she continued to try to run and was restrained\n20",

The staff involved were Staff 4, Staff 11, Staff 15,\nStaff 19, Staff 21, Staff 25, Staff 26, Staff 27, and Staff\n28.\n• Youth B File: Youth B has a history of being verbally and\nphysically aggressive. She also has a history of self-harm.\nEach time Youth B was restrained at the facility those\nrestraints required multiple people due to her level of\naggression.\n• Youth I File: Youth I was admitted to the facility on 8/18/22\nand only had a few incidents while at the facility. All of\nthose incidents took place between 2/12/23 and 2/15/23.\nIncidents were due to trying to run away, self-harm, and\naggression toward others. There is no indication in her file\nthat she has asthma or any type of breathing issues.\n• Youth O File: Youth O was admitted to the facility on\n11/4/22. She had issues with running out of the facility, self-\nharm, and aggression toward others.\n• Staff 1 File: Staff 1 was hired on 6/14/17. She did not have\nany disciplines in her file. She received training in TCI on\n4/12/22 and discipline and behavior management on\n2/9/23.\n• Staff 2 File: Staff 2 was hired on 12/15/21. She did not have\nany disciplines in her file. She received a restraint refresher\ntraining on 3/7/23 and discipline and behavior management\non 2/9/23.\n• Staff 4 employee file: Staff was hired on 10/17/19.

She was trained in\nTCI on 1/4/23, discipline and behavior management on\n2/9/23.\n• Spit Shield Protocols: To prevent staff from being spit on\nduring a restraint a “spit shield” can be used by placing it on\na youth’s face. It further states that nothing should be\nplaced in the youth’s mouth and pressure should not be\napplied to the youth’s face or mouth. The protocol\nreferences a surgical mask can be used if a spit shield is\nunavailable.\n• Restraint Technique: The facility’s restraint technique at the\ntime of the incidents was Therapeutic Crisis Intervention\n21",
    "(TCI). A review of TCI training materials found that for a\nyouth who is spitting staff should look away. The restraint\ntechnique has staff positioned at the youth’s head with the\nyouth’s arm bend between the staff’s knees.\nAnalysis While youth did claim the staff covered their mouth with the\nyouth’s shirt when spitting in a restraint the staff denied that this\nmeant the shirt was touching the youth’s mouth or restricting the\nyouths breathing. There is not enough information to indicate the\nrestraints in these allegations were unsafe.\nTechnical Assistance:\nPut staff first names on reports and ensure staff on restraint report\nmatches the staff listed in MiSACWIS.\nAll restraints should be logged into MiSACWIS separately even if\nthey are within the same incident.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & R 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection Rule 109.

This would be done by\nstaff pulling the collar of the youth’s shirt up and over their mouth.\nStaff 3, Staff 4, Staff 8, Staff 9, Staff 25, and Staff 28 all confirmed\nthat it was common practice for them and/or their co-workers to\npull a youth’s shirt up over their face in order to block their spit\nwhile the youth was in a restraint.\nDocumentation:\n• Spit Shield Protocols: As indicated above the policy allows\nfor a spit shield or surgical mask. The policy does not\nindicate a shirt can be utilized to block spit.\n• Restraint Technique: As indicated above TCI indicates staff\nshould look away when a youth is spitting.\n22",

Staff 2 would say things like if you were my kid I\nwould \"whoop\" you. She could not recall the exact words, but it\nwas something similar. No one took it seriously as the two would\noften talk to each other that way. Youth B did not take it seriously.\nStaff 14 then said the comments were not specifically directed at\nYouth B but were directed to the youth in general. \"If these were\nour kids this would not be happening.\" She did not think Staff 2\nwas out of line.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/21/23.

They would have to ask the supervisor for these things, and\nit would get set out, but the staff would not go get it from the office\nfor them. If the youth would complain about lack of supplies the\nstaff would tell them if they wanted the item, then they should get\nout of the facility.\nYouth B reported the facility did have hygiene supplies, but the\nstaff would never get it for them. The staff just did not want to go\nget it. They would say they were too busy but would not actually\nbe doing anything.\nYouth I stated the facility had hygiene supplies but they wanted to\nmake the supplies last, so they only got a little which was not\nenough. The staff told them to ask their peers for soap, but if they\nasked it would be an issue.\nYouth D reported the staff rarely gave the youth hygiene supplies.\nWhen she first got to the facility, they got supplies but later they\ncould not get soap or toothpaste.

The only people who had keys were\nthe therapist, case managers, and treatment leaders. When they\nwould ask the therapist to get them items, she would put it in the\nsupervisor’s office. The supervisors would then say it was not\nthere.\nOn 5/19/23 Courtesy DHHS worker 6 who was interviewing\nYouth E stated she could confirm that the facility was not providing\nthe youth with hygiene items. She stated when she did her shift\ncoverage at the facility the youth did not have toothpaste or\ndeodorant. When she brought it up to staff they went out and\nbought it for the youth.\nYouth L stated at the beginning of her stay at the facility they\nwould get new hygiene supplies on Sundays but then that\nstopped. They would have to ask a supervisor for anything they\nneeded. Sometimes the supervisors would get it but sometimes\nthey did not have it. The youth would share or use bar soap when\nthey could not get their own supplies. This would not happen\noften. The youth would always have toothbrushes and toothpaste.\nYouth P stated they did not always have hygiene supplies while at\nthe facility. They could no longer get stuff with their points. If they\nran out of something, the youth would ask staff and staff would tell\nthe supervisor. The facility did not always have the items they\nneeded. The youth would have to borrow from each other. It got\nworse near the end. The staff had to start giving them little\nportions in cups to use. They had toothbrushes but often had to\nborrow toothpaste.\nStaff 2 stated the youth never brought up any concerns about\nhygiene supplies.\nStaff 5 reported, the youth had hygiene items, but they were\nirresponsible with them. The facility had tons of hygiene items and\nthey still have them. When Staff 5 worked she would have the\nyouth put their items on their bunk so she could see what they\nneeded. If the youth wait until the last minute for things, they\ncannot always get them because the people with access to items\nwere no longer working.

The youth would tell the supervisor\ndirectly if they needed items.\nStaff 8 reported he received complaints from the youth about not\nhaving hygiene supplies. He said when he questioned the youth,\nonly 2 youth said they did not have enough, and the rest of the\nyouth said they had enough. When he asked Staff 21 about it, she\ntold him they were only giving out small amounts rather than the\nentire bottles, so the big bottles were not waisted. There was also\na safety issue with Youth O, so they controlled the items she\nutilized more closely. Nothing led him to believe the youth were\nnot getting the hygiene items they needed. The facility had plenty\nof supplies in stock. He did not get any complaints about\ntoothbrushes or toothpaste, it was just about shampoo and\nconditioner.\nStaff 14 reported if the youth asked for hygiene supplies from\nmost of the supervisors, they would not get it. “Supervisors were\npretty shitty” about not getting the girls hygiene items. If a girl\nwoke up in the morning and did not have toothpaste and their\npeers would not share then the supervisors would say, “I guess\nyou don't get to brush your teeth then.\" Staff 14 could not say\nwhat supervisors would say this, but it was most supervisors other\nthan Staff 5 and Staff 11.\nStaff 21 said she was the person who did inventory of the youth\nhygiene supplies every Sunday night.

Staff 21 reported she is the only person who had a key to\nthe storage room. She said they would occasionally run low on\nsomething but were never out of anything. Staff 21 said they\nstocked the dresser because the youth would want or need things\nwhen she was not there. This way the girls could ask the\nsupervisors for things, and they could get them.
