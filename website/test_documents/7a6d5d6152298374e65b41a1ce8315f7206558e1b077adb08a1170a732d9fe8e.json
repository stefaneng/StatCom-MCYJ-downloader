    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Communication\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4124\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a written policy\nDescription regarding communication that ensures that a child is able\nto communicate with family and friends in a manner\nappropriate to the child’s functioning and consistent with\nthe child’s treatment plan and security level.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was denied the ability to call her mother and caseworker\nby facility staff.\nInvestigation Email communication occurred with the Complainant on\n03/08/2024 and she had no additional information to provide.\nThe Chief Administrator was interviewed during a previously\nscheduled announced visit to the facility on 03/07/2024. She\nconfirmed the policy as of that date of the facility for facilitating\nphone calls with youth and approved contacts. The Chief\nAdministrator stated there were specific days of the week\nrespectively reserved for phone contact with caseworkers and\nfamilies. Outside of those days she stated there were times when\na youth would ask staff if they could call their caseworker or family\nmembers and staff had been instructed by facility leadership to not\nallow them, but they would alert the caseworker that youth wanted\na phone call. She could not confirm why this policy was not\nincluded in what had previously been provided to Licensing for\nreview, or when this policy was instituted prior to her time in the\nChief Administrator position. The Chief Administrator described\nsome motivation behind the facility policy, including the common\noccurrence that contact with family was triggering for youth.\nYouth A was interviewed during a previously scheduled\nannounced visit to the facility on 03/07/2024. She stated she had\nbeen placed at the facility for a few weeks. Youth A described her\nexperience with communication outside of the program. She\nrecalled her first couple of weeks at the program she was able to\nmake phone calls to those on her approved contact list at any\ntime. Youth A stated since this time she was told she could only\nmake outgoing calls to her caseworker on Mondays or\nWednesdays, and her family only on the weekends. Youth A\n2",
    "could not recall which specific staff this involved. Youth A recalled\na specific instance when she was feeling anxious, and she wanted\nto call her mother. Youth A stated this occurred on a Tuesday,\nand the Chief Administrator informed her she could not call her\nmother that day. Youth A stated she eventually had a brief AWOL\nfrom the facility that day, and she believed not being able to call\nher mother attributed to that. In addition, Youth A stated the day\nprior, which was Wednesday 03/06/2024, she requested to staff\nthat she be able to call her caseworker. Youth A reported the staff\nworking (which she could not recall) stated to her that her phone\nlist could not be found at this time, and she could not make a\nphone call this day until it was located.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A’s foster care case was reviewed, and it was noted\nthat she was placed at the facility on 02/25/2024.\n• Policies & procedures provided by the facility were\nreviewed:\no The “Resident Handbook” that was current as of the\ntime of this investigation was reviewed. This was\nlast revised on 06/18/2023. In this policy the\n“Communications” section covers phone calls that\nyouth can make. There were no specific policies\nlisted regarding when youth can make phone calls\nout to caseworkers or family. It was stated that\n“Families and friends are encouraged to call during\nschedule times” but did not specify what times to\nwhich that referred.\no During the previously scheduled face-to-face visit to\nthe facility on 03/07/2024 it was confirmed the\nprogram had more specific policy regarding youth\nmaking phone calls. At that time the facility allowed\nyouth to make outgoing phone calls to pre-approved\ncontacts on Mondays and Wednesdays during\ncertain times after the school day. Incoming phone\ncalls were allowed at any time.\n▪ At the time of initiation of this investigation\nthis updated policy had not been provided to\nLicensing for review or feedback.\n• The current contract the facility holds with DHHS\nreferences a requirement that the facility “arrange for the\nchild to make immediate phone contact (within two hours of\nplacement) with their parents and/or siblings whenever\nreasonably possible.”\n3",
    "Analysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was evidence found that the policy of the facility\nregarding contact with family and caseworkers was too restrictive,\nviolating the rule cited.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility is advised to revise their phone call policies for\nyouth to allow for more access to outgoing calls to\ncaseworkers, service providers and families to allow for the\nbest communication, case management and treatment of\nthe youth.\n• Staff should be trained in the location of essential\ninformation such as approved contacts and phone numbers\nand the program should ensure that the information is\neasily available at any given time.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Based on the findings in this report a CAP is required.\nPer SIR #2024C0001037SI, a 1st provisional license is recommended.\n04/12/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/19/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4"
