Staff 1 singularly\nphysically restrained Resident A, so Resident A could not walk out the door.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/19/2020 I reviewed the facility’s incident report dated 5/15/2020 for 5:35pm,\ncompleted by Staff 1 and signed off by supervisors on 5/15/2020 (all signatures were\nnot legible) and Administrator B on 5/18/2020. The incident report indicated the\nfollowing:\n Resident A requested to speak to a supervisor and Staff 1 told Program\nSupervisor 1 of the request. Staff 1 told Resident A of the consequences if he\ndid not comply with study hall guidelines. Resident A said, “I’ll take the day.”\nResident A walked out the “slate room” and went toward the exit. Staff 1 got\nin front of Resident A, stopping Resident A’s movement. Resident A went the\nother way and tried to walk out the kitchen exit. Resident A’s hand touched\nthe exit and Staff 1 secured Resident A until Supervisor 3 assisted with CPI\n(Crisis Prevention Intervention). Resident A appeared as if he was trying to\ntruant.\n A “Narrative (Triggers & De-escalation) section that indicated: Resident A\n“wanted to control the situation and be disrespectful towards staff”. Resident\nA calmed down after talking with Program Supervisor 1.\n The nurse was notified.\nDue to COVID-19, an on-site visit did not occur. I interviewed Administrator B and\nProgram Supervisor 1 via telephone on 5/20/2020. Email contact also occurred with\nAdministrator B.\n3",
    "Administrator B did not witness the incident. She reviewed the incident report and\nspoke with staff. She provided me a copy of the incident report. Administrator B\nreported the AIM’s program is an open program, but residents are not just allowed to\nwalk off. Nor are they automatically restrained for attempting to AWOL. The\nsituation of safety and risk of harm to the resident must be assessed to determine a\nneed for physical intervention. She indicated, in this instance, from all accounts,\nResident A was not trying to AWOL. Resident A was trying to reach Program\nSupervisor 1 to talk to him; and Program Supervisor 1 was just outside the facility’s\ndoor. Staff 1’s action and reaction in the situation was not in a manner as trained in\nCPI. Additionally, Staff 1 did not immediately disengage with Resident A when\nsupervisors advised him to do so.\nAdministrator B reported Staff 1’s date of hire as 11/16/2017. Staff 1 completed\ninitial CPI module training, as well as, refresher training on 6/7/2018, and 6/12/2019;\nand other CPI modules on 6/6/2018, 6/12/2019 and 3/20/2020. Staff 1 had one\ndisciplinary action on 8/3/2018 related to resident supervision with respect to a\nresident self-harming incident. Staff 1 could tell the youth was doing something but\ndid not investigate.\nProgram Supervisor 1 affirmed Administrator B’s reporting pertaining his location\nand Resident A’s pursuit to reach him when the incident happened. Program\nSupervisor 1 also reported the facility utilizes CPI for its behavior management and\nphysical intervention systems. He reported, they try not to engage with physical\nintervention if possible. In regard to this incident, he was not certain that physical\nintervention was warranted. He advised he was conversating with Supervisor 2 and\nSupervisor 3 when the incident was occurring. He did not hear all, and did not know\nwhether Staff 1 tried to de-escalate Resident A. He only knew, heard at the point\nResident A kicked on the door; and he, Supervisor 3 and Supervisor 2 became\ninvolved in the physical intervention. As to the complaint indicating Resident A was\nrestrained and taken to the floor so Resident A would not walk out the door and\nescape. Program Supervisor 1 denied Resident A being taken to the floor; and he\ndid not believe Resident A was trying to escape. Staff 1 had Resident A was up\nagainst a wall; and after Program Supervisor 1 and the other two supervisors\nintervened, he advised Staff 1 to end the restraint. Program Supervisor 1 reported\nthere were five residents, at the time of incident. He did not know which residents\nmay have witnessed the incident.\nDue to COVID-19, I interviewed Resident A(age14), Resident B (age 14), Resident\nC (age 15), Resident D (age 11) and Resident E (age 15) via Facetime on\n5/20/2020.\nResident A denied an attempt to AWOL. He just wanted to talk with the supervisor.\nHe explained that he was called out of study time, by his counselor, to make a\ntelephone call. Following the ten-minute telephone call, Resident A went into the\nfacility’s “slate room” (A room where residents go for quiet time). He was followed at\nsome point by Staff 1. Staff 1 advised him he needed to either finished up his study\n4",
    "hour of take a consequence for missing it. Resident A said, he had completed ten\nminutes of the study hour and Staff 1 wanted him to complete the full hour.\nResident A initially agreed to take the consequence but thought about it, then said\nno to the consequence. Staff 1 then told him he could complete 45-minutes, of the\nremaining study hour. Resident A asked to speak with Program Supervisor 1 and\nStaff 1 said he would talk with Program Supervisor 2 about the matter. Resident A\nalso asked Staff 2 to call the supervisor. Staff 2 said she would, and that she did\ncontact Program Supervisor 1. Resident A reported, he was concerned with talking\nto Program Supervisor 2 promptly, because of the time. It was around 3:15pm and\nProgram Supervisor 1 would leave at 3:30pm. Resident A saw through the window\nthat Program Supervisor 1 was outside. He asked to go talk with him and proceeded\nto walk to the door. Staff 1 grabbed Resident A’s arm and restrained him against the\ndoor. Program Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, and Supervisor 3 intervened and\nProgram Supervisor 1 told Staff 1 to let him go. Resident A said he was never\ntaken to the floor; and he did not receive any injuries. He denied a prior negative\nrelationship with Staff 1. He just thought he should not have been restrained or given\na consequence for being taken out of study hour to make call to his parent.\nResident B reported, Resident A went to the “slate” after making a call to his mom.\nThen Staff 1 was talking to Resident A and gave Resident A a day of restrictive\nprivileges (less participation in some activities and ‘dining details such as washing\ndishes, mopping, doing table, etc.) for missing the whole hour of study hour.\nResident B did not think that was normal. He affirmed Resident A’s reporting of\nwhat Resident A wanted to do with respects to talking to a supervisor; and them\nobserving the supervisors outside. Resident B said, Resident A tried to walk out one\ndoor and Staff 1 held him back. Then Resident A tried to go out the kitchen door and\nStaff 1 restrained Resident A. The restraint was a normal restraint. Staff 1 held\nResident A in between the pantry wall and where they put the dishes. Resident A\nwas cursing and telling Staff 1 “to get the fuck off me”; and called Staff 1 the “N” and\n“B” word. Staff 1 told Resident A “No I’m not getting off you until you calm down.”.\nThe supervisors heard the call for assistance by Staff 2 and they intervened.\nResident C reported observing the restraint, which he thought looked normal in\ncomparison to other restraints he had observed. He said, Resident A was trying to\nwalk out the door to talk to supervisors and Staff 1 grabbed both of Resident A’s\narms to place behind Resident A ‘s back. Staff 1 hooked his arms behind Resident A\nand restrained Resident A. Resident A was cursing, and Staff 1 was not saying\nanything.\nResident D did not recall the incident. Resident D said all the restraints he had\nwitnessed have been proper.\nResident E did not have information about the incident. He said, he was taking a\nshower and did not witness the incident.\n5",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed by me via telephone on 5/26/2020. She acknowledged\nawareness of the incident. Staff 1 was her partner for that afternoon shift; and\nResident A was assigned to Staff 1. Staff 2 thought something usual was happening\nbetween Staff 1 and Resident A but she was not certain of what that was. She\nnoticed that Staff 1 did not respond to Staff 3(who was ending his shift) when Staff 3\nasked Staff 1 whether Resident A could have carrots. Staff 1 was right there, but\nnever responded. Staff 2 advised when a resident is assigned to another staff, they\ntry not to intervene for that staff. However, since Staff 1 did not respond to Staff 3,\nshe did by saying, yes.\nStaff 2 reported at some point Case Coordinator 4 came for Resident A, indicating\nResident A had a Zoom meeting with family. Afterwards, Resident A sat in the slate\nroom with his books, but then came and reported to Staff 1 he would take the one\nday of “RP” (Restricted Privileges). Staff 2 did not know when Staff 1 gave the “RP”.\nShe heard Resident A agreeing to the “RP”, then taking it back. Resident A said he\nwas not taking “RP” for talking with his mother. Afterward, between 3:00pm -\n3:15pm, Staff 1 and Resident A talked. Staff 1 did not hear that conservation, but a\nfew minutes later Resident A kept asking to talk with Program Supervisor 1.\nResident A said, it was not fair that he be punished for talking to his mom. Resident\nA stood up, and Resident A motioned as if he was going to run to the door. Staff 1\nstood up in front of Resident A. Resident A was loud, cursing Staff 1 and tried to\npush pass Staff 1. The two were touching and Staff 1 was directing Resident A\nback. Staff 2 intervened verbally, calling Resident A’s name, so as to get him to calm\ndown. Resident A then said, “You don’t want me to go this way; I’ll go another way”,\nand Resident A walked toward the dining area door. Resident A was yelling for\nProgram Supervisor 1. Staff 2 tried, to signal Program Supervisor 1 with her finger\nvia the window, but he did not see her. She was going behind Resident A, to let him\ntalk with Program Supervisor 1 but Staff 1 ran behind Resident A. Staff 1 grabbed\nResident A by the back of Resident A’s shirt, and then restrained Resident A. At\none-point Resident A was in the air, he had been lifted off the floor. Staff 2 surmised\nthat happened because Staff 1 tried to pick Resident A up to put Resident A in the\nrestraint. Staff 2 said Staff 1 may have also held Resident A up against a door or\nsomething. She was not sure of what, because by that time she was getting the\nother residents moved and calling for assistance. She recalled Resident A saying let\nme go “Mother Fucker; and he tried to throw a blow. The supervisors intervened\nand took Resident A outside.\nStaff 2 reported Staff 1’s action was not the proper way. She said Staff 1 is\napproximately, 6’2’’ and Resident A 5’2’’ or 5’3’’ and the proper way would have\nbeen to secure the resident’s arm or wrist, then contact someone for assistance to\nget the resident into the proper restraint hold, so the resident could calm down. Staff\n1 did not do that. She said, Resident A does not like Staff 1; and Staff 1 and\nResident A were both heated. Resident A was really irate and calling Staff 1 names.\nResident A called Staff 1 a “Bitch ass nigga” and Staff 1 said, “What you gonna do\nabout it”. Staff 2 said, once Resident A escalated, nothing she heard from Staff 1\nwas de-escalating. She said the facility’s overall standard is if the child escalates, to\n6",
    "talk them down, to deescalate; to restrain as a last resort. She reported the\npunishment given Resident A likely escalated him and she would not have given the\nconsequence. She said, when Resident A gets upset, Resident A can work through\nit pretty quickly with assistance.\nSupervisor 2 and Supervisor 3 were interviewed by me via separate telephone calls\non 5/26/2020. Both were outside of the door with Program Supervisor 1 when the\nincident occurred. It was shift change and Supervisor 2, who was departing the\nfacility, was filling the other two supervisors in on the outcome of the first shift. At\nsome point Resident A tried to get Program Supervisor 1’s attention. Supervisor 3\nsaw Resident A motioning to Program Supervisor 1 prior to the door opening.\nSupervisor 3 questioned what had happened so quickly.\nSupervisor 2 and Supervisor 3 reported as they came by the dining room door,\nResident A yelled to Program Supervisor 1. Supervisor 2 said Resident A slammed\nthe door open and Staff 1 grabbed Resident A around the upper torso, under the\narm and pulled Resident A back inside. He, said, Program Supervisor 1 and\nSupervisor 3 got to the door quicker than he. When Supervisor 2 got inside Staff 1\nhad Resident A up against a door in the dining area. Resident A was screaming for\nProgram Supervisor 1 to have Staff 1 let him go. Program Supervisor 1 told Staff 1\nto release Resident A. It took a second request from Program Supervisor 1 for Staff\n1 to release Resident A. Resident A told them Resident A was mad over being given\na consequence for missing study hall, which occurred due to him being pulled away\nfor a telephone call. Supervisor 2 reported what he observed was not CPI protocol.\nHe said, that even inside to restraint the resident up against the wall as a single\nperson was not proper. He was not sure, if Staff 1 thought Resident A was running\nway, but what he (Supervisor 2) saw was not related to CPI protocol for handling\nsuch. He affirmed Administrator B’s reporting related to Staff 1’s employment time\nand CPI training.\nSupervisor 3 saw Resident A pulled backward when the dining room door opened.\nHe said, the voices did not sound right, they were loud. He called to Program\nSupervisor 1 and they entered immediately. Staff 1 had Resident A up against the\ndishwasher. Resident A’s voice was elevated, and he was trying to get loose.\nProgram Supervisor 1 told Staff 1 twice to let Resident A go. Supervisor 3 wasn’t\nsure whether Staff 1’s delayed in releasing Resident A was perhaps because Staff 1\ndidn’t hear the first instruction. Supervisor 3 and Program Supervision 1 put their\narm on Resident A to calm him down. Supervisor 3 also mentioned Staff 1’s height.\nHe said Staff is a “tall guy” and Program Supervisor 1 had observed Staff 1’s arm\nwas near Resident A’s neck and Program Supervisor 1 wanted Staff 1 to let go.\nSupervisor 3 said he was positioned on the other side of Program Supervisor 1, so\nhe did not see that. Supervisor 3 observed Staff 1’s face. Staff 1 seemed frustrated\nand agitated. Supervisor 3 spoke with Staff 1 to find out what happened. Staff 1\nreported when Resident A touched the door, it was a truancy situation; he (Staff 1)\nthought Resident A was going to run. Supervisor 3 did not perceive that to be true.\nSupervisor 3 said, “we’ were right outside the door”. Staff 1 “could see us”. He said\n7",
    "Resident A has a good relationship with Program Supervisor 1 and that would have\nbeen why Resident A was seeking Program Supervisor 1’s assistance. He said,\neven if Resident A was trying to truant, staff should “still try to talk to and deescalate”\nthe resident, “not grab the resident”, especially if no other staff are nearby. The staff\nshould also call for assistance. Supervisor 3 reported facility policy does not allow for\na one-person restraint, unless in an extremely circumstance, which this was not. He\nsaid, Staff 1 usually has a good relationship with residents, but Staff 1 “can be\nimpatient and that appeared in play that day” of the incident.\nStaff 1 was interviewed by me via telephone on 5/28/2020. He reported being\nemployed with the AIM program for 30 months and to completing initial CPI training\nat hire and refresher training in 2019. He reported physical management being able\nto occur in staff boundary situations, attempted escapes, peer fights, and resident\nself-harming. He acknowledged his involvement in the incident with Resident A,\nand to him writing the incident report. Staff 1 reported the incident occurred between\n3-4:00pm.\nSometime after Staff 1 arrived on shift, Resident A asked Staff 1 the location of the\nother staff. Resident A went out his way to not speak with Staff 1; to engage with\nStaff 2, not him (Staff 1). They were in study time, and prior to study hour ending\nResident A asked to speak with Program Supervisor 1 about going home. Later\nResident A asked to speak with Program Supervisor 1 about getting out of study\nhour, saying “I’m not trying to study now”. Staff 1 affirmed Staff 2’s reporting related\nto Case Coordinator 4 retrieving Resident A from the group for a telephone call and\nResident A going to the slate thereafter. Resident A was gone 15-20 minutes. The\nstudy group was approximately 45 minutes into the study hour but during that time\nResident A was eating a snack and lollygagging around. Resident A did not want to\ndo the study time. Staff 1 followed Resident A into the slate room to talk with him.\nResident A did not have pen or paper and was not studying. Staff 1 advised\nResident A that Resident A still had to do a study hour within the shift time. Resident\nA asked, “you are giving me an hour for talking with by mama”. Staff 1 then advised\nResident A to just give him 45 minutes and Resident A would not get a\nconsequence. After finding out the consequence would be one day of “RP”,\nResident A first agreed to it. Resident A then changed his mind. Resident A said,\n“No. I’m not taking no fucking day for talking with my mama”. Staff 1 explained to\nResident A, he (Resident A) did not have to take the day. Resident A could just do\nthe study time. Resident A asked to speak with Program Supervisor 1 and repeated\nhis prior statement about not taking the “RP” day. Resident A asked Staff 2 where\nwas Program Supervisor 1; and Staff 2 advised Resident A, Program Supervisor 1\nwas outside. Staff 2 asked Resident A to calm down, to sit down and told him she\nwould get Program Supervisor 1. Resident A did not comply. Resident A walked to\nthe door and Staff 1 stepped in front of Resident A. Resident A told him, “don’t\nfucking touch me. I said, I’m not.” Resident A proceeded to walk toward the kitchen\ndoor; and Staff 1 followed. Staff 1 tried to step in front of Resident A again when\nResident A opened the door. Staff 1, said, “I pulled him back in to try to stop him\nfrom truanting. I held him against the wall until assistance came.” I asked Staff 1 if\n8",
    "he was certain, Resident A was trying to truant or whether Resident A was just trying\nto get to Program Supervisor 1, whom Resident A and he both knew was outside the\ndoor. Staff 1 reported, in his mind, since he had told Resident A to not go out the\ndoor, that meant Resident A was trying to truant. Staff 1 acknowledged truancy was\nnot a part of Resident A’s history. Nor had Resident A, in the 10 months Resident A\nhad resided at the facility tried to truant. However, Staff 1 still thought Resident A\nwas trying to AWOL. He reported policy indicates if a resident is trying to truant, the\nstaff should call for assistance over their walkie talkie and do your best to stop the\nresident. Staff 1 advised that is done if they are not in close proximately to the\nyouth, but he was. He admitted CPI does not allow for a one-person restraint. It\ncalls for a two-person restraint. He said “I didn’t really restraint him. I just secured\nhim and held him against the wall until assistance arrived”. He said, he had his arms\naround Resident A’s arms to make sure Resident A did not hit him and that they\nwere both safe. He said, Resident A was flailing his arms and Resident A tried to\npush off the wall. He, said, Staff 2 called for assistance; called a “Code 2”, meaning\nan irate resident or one doing something they should not be doing. Staff 2 was also\nsecuring the other residents. Supervisor 2, Supervisor 3, and Program Supervisor 1\narrived, and Supervisor 3 assisted in the restraint. They placed Resident A in a two-\nperson restraint until Program Supervisor 1 said to release Resident A. Program\nSupervisor 1 only made one request for Resident A to be release. Staff 1 said,\nProgram Supervisor 1’s release directive was not directed to him in particular, it was\njust letting him and Supervisor 3 both know to release the youth, and they did so.\nStaff 1 reported during the time he was holding Resident A, Resident A was cursing,\nsaying he hated him, calling him the derogatory name as reported by Staff 2. Staff 1\nwas not saying anything. He stated that, “in those moments, they tell us not to\nspeak, so as to not make the incident worst”. He denied pulling Resident A off the\nfloor. He pulled Resident A back from the door but, “It wasn’t aggressive.” He said, “I\nwrapped my arms around him and pulled him back. I put one arm forward on each\nside of him to secure him.” He said, he never had an incident like that, that no\nresident had truanted on him. Staff 1 acknowledged he had an option to allow\nResident A to proceed to Program Supervisor 1 while Staff 1 stayed in close\nproximately to Resident A. Staff 1 reported had Resident A complied to the earlier\nrequests, Resident A would not have needed supervisor assistance. Staff 1\nsurmised that Resident A was likely mad with him at the beginning of the shift. He\nsaid, he tried to work with Resident A. He tried to talk with and deescalate Resident\nA earlier on in the incident. He said, his action earlier was to give Resident A\noptions. He said, to him Resident A was looking for a reason to act out.\nResident B, Staff 1, Staff 2, Program Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, and Supervisor 3\ndid not observe injuries or marks to Resident A after the incident. Supervisor 2 and\nSupervisor 3 also both reported Resident A did not report any marks or bruises.\nReviewed:\n Incident report as reported earlier within this report.\n9",
    " Documentation showing Resident A is a temporary court ward, who was\nplaced at the facility on 6/30/2019.\n The facility’s Staff-to resident supervision policy.\n Nursing note, that indicated Resident A was assessed at 4:45pm on\n5/15/2020.
