The facility is compliant with all MISEP requirements.\n3.) The facility is compliant with all MDHHS Contract/Policy requirements.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nI provided 1:1 training to the new social service worker on CCI licensing rules and\nhow they correspond to documentation.

I explained how to document changes or\nsubstitutions to the original meal menu.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nI verified that systems for due date tracking for treatment plans, psychotropic\nmedication consents, medical and dental exams were intact and discussed ideas for\nplans of correction with the social service supervisor. I advised that school\nenrollment dates be printed and maintained in the youth files.\n2",
    "EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no corrective action plans required during this licensing period.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 12. 2023\n____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 18, 2023\n____________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n3"
