Youth N was released from Lincoln\nCenter but was picked up recently and was placed at another\nsecure residential facility. Youth N reported that Supervisor R\n7",
    "would look her up and down and mentioned something about her\nass. She reported he came into her doorway after lights were out\nwhen she was at Lincoln Center, and he stood in her doorway.\nYouth N reported he would ask her to open her mouth to take her\nmedication and he would come inside her room when passing her\nmedication when no other female staff were around. Youth N\nreported that Supervisor R referred to his penis as gator man and\nthe monster. Youth N reported that he referenced his penis this\nway in January 2023 when she was at Lincoln Center.

Youth A,\nB and C are seen milling around the Pod and one other staff\nmember is also on the Pod but is not in contact with Supervisor R\nor Youth Z who are together in her room with the door open.\nAnalysis There is evidence to support that Supervisor R was not interacting\nappropriately with the residents and was unable to provide for\ntheir needs, protection and supervision. All youth interviewed\nreported similar inappropriate interactions and behaviors with\nSupervisor R.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2021C0201016 with approved CAP\n2021C0103027 with approved CAP\n2023C0000424 with approved CAP\n2023C0000450 with approved CAP\n8",
