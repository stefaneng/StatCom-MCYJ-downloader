EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThis incident related to an allegation that the foster parent’s adult daughter, who\nlived in the home had restrained the foster parent’s foster son on more than one\noccasion. Additionally, that this adult daughter became aggressive with the child on\n8/20/17 and had to be restrained by other adults from harming the child. The special\nevaluation findings determined the adult daughter restrained the child when he\nlunged at her. The foster home was not found in violation of that aspect of the\nbehavior management rule. The foster home was found in noncompliance of the\nfoster home reporting rule, for failure to report a change in the home’s composition;\nbecause the adult daughter was visiting in the home since 7/17/17. The investigation\nfound that the foster parent had been “whooping” the children in the home using a\nbelt. The foster home was found in violation of the behavior management rule, foster\nparent qualification rule and foster parent duties rule. The children were replaced\nfrom the foster home; and revocation of the foster home’s license was\nrecommended.\nThe agency appeared to have acted appropriate in this incident and it adhered to\nDepartmental time frames and requirements.\n16",
    "The agency has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2017 Renewal inspection. At\nthat time the agency was found in violation of a total twenty-two rule, ISEP and\npolicy type citations. There were no personnel/employee violations; one rule type\ncertification violation; and several foster care violations. The agency submitted an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the Renewal inspection but was not successful\nwith that corrective action plan. This Interim inspection resulted in two employee\nviolations, five licensing violations and a slight increase in the number of foster care\nviolations.\nIt needs reporting that since the 2017 inspection, the agency experienced some\nstaffing turnover. Staffing changes resulted due to, staff resigning for greater\nadvancement, moves to DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services), one\nstaff’s promotion to another position, and sadly one staff died. The agency tackled\nthe staffing challenges by filling positions quickly, focusing on future staff retention\nand trying to improve and maintain staff morale. The agency hired another foster\ncare supervisor, so that there is a supervisor permanently stationed at its Ann Arbor\nsatellite office. It is also seeking to hire a person to work directly on foster parent\nrecruitment and retention, to free up staff from much of this function. They are also\ndeveloping/hiring a foster care trainer supervisor. This position would focus on\ntrainings for new staff, staff shadowing coverage, report writing, etc., with the hope\nof allowing foster supervisors to focus on their respective staff/teams and not have to\nworry about all aspects of new worker tasks.\nThe agency has also expanded its independent living program in the Flint area. It\nhas acquired a rental property, which will allow six females to reside there, via\nIndependence Living Plus. The home is modernly furnished, very well kept and\nappears to be well organized.
