CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\n12",
    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were three incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\n An investigation was initiated on 12/28/21 due to an allegation the foster\nparent used running as discipline. A violation was found and a CAP approved.\nThe CAP included parenting class, foster parent support group, review of the\nbehavior management policy during the investigation and at each\nannual/renewal evaluation. The CAP was completed on 5/19/22.\n An investigation was initiated on 3/9/22 due to an allegation of physical\ndiscipline with a child in the home. A safety plan was immediately developed.\nUpon investigation a rule violation was determined and a CAP approved. The\nCAP included attending an FTM to discuss case and needs, increased\noversight by agency staff, completion of three trainings regarding trauma,\nreviewing the agency behavior management policy, reading the books\nBeyond Consequences and Love & Logic, and writing summaries of the\nbooks. The CAP was completed on 4/5/22.\n An investigation was initiated on 3/31/22 due to an allegation the Foster\nParent hit a child in the home. The investigation determined a violation of\nrules. A CAP was approved which included training regarding empathy,\nsympathy, and active listening in parenting, utilizing emergency/after hours\nstaff for support, attending FP support group, and reviewing the agency\nbehavior management policy. The CAP was still in progress at the time of this\nreview.\nOverall, the agency completed thorough special evaluations that were in compliance\nwith licensing rules. Appropriate CAPs were developed for the violations and\ncompleted as required.\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP was approved on 10/12/21 as a result of the 9/22/21 Interim Review. Sixteen\nviolations were addressed in the CAP regarding placement documentation,\ntreatment plans, medical passports, service plans, case contacts, FTMs, medication,\nmedical/dental forms, IL requirements, visits, and parenting time. The agency\nreported the CAP was implemented effectively over the past year. Improvement\nwas observed in several areas during this review. However, the current review found\n30 violations, including 10 repeat violations. The increased number of violations\nappears to be due to challenges working under COVID restrictions and staffing\nchanges. The addition of the Independent Living Plus contract, also attributed to\nsome violations as the agency adjusts to the new requirements. The agency expects\nthe identified areas to improve now that staffing has improved.\nA Special Evaluation (2022C0212007) initiated on 2/15/22, resulted in a CAP which\nwas approved on 3/21/22. The evaluation was initiated due to an allegation the\nagency did not return a child home as required by a court order. A violation of DHHS\n13",
    "policy FOM 722-15 (Case Closing) was found, due to the agency delaying the return\nhome of a child due to scheduling difficulties. The CAP continues to be implemented\nand monitored at this time. The agency has had no further concerns or violations\nregarding this policy.\nChief Administrator Assessment (CAA)\nThe CAA was reviewed and discussed on-site. The CAA indicated the 2021 Interim\nCAP had been implemented over the past year via staff meetings, trainings,\nmandated contact entry time, and quarterly reviews of documents for timeliness. The\nagency also reported using the child welfare policy mailbox as a resource when\nseeking policy/contract clarification. The agency reported that time management\ncontinues to be a struggle with some staff. Staff are able to complete tasks\nthoroughly but have difficulty meeting the timeframes. The agency reported that\nstaffing continued to be a struggle over this past year as it was with most agencies.\nThe agency addressed this by working with the local DHHS office to transfer cases\nand balance caseloads as needed. Overall, the CAA identified areas of need that\nalign with what as found during this review.\nInterviews\nInterviews were completed on-site with foster care and adoption staff. Staff reported\nfeeling supported by the agency. Supervisors are helpful, knowledgeable, and able\nto anticipate staff needs. Caseloads are manageable and co-workers help one\nanother as needed. Overall, staff did not have any concern and could not identify\nany areas where the agency could improve.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, and contract/policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be\nissued a renewal of their regular license.\n_ ______________ July 6, 2022______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n14",
