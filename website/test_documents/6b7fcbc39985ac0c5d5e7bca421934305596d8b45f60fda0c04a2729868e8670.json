    "The agency has submitted no acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. There have been no special\ninvestigations of this program during this period. There are a number of KPI’s that\nhave lowered in this period. This appears directly related to the impact of the\npandemic on provision of services and data collection and was reported to be the\nreason by the agency. For comparison, in the months prior to the pandemic, the\nfacility numbers were much better, with many more in compliance. It is also noted\nthat during recent months the numbers have improved. It appears the agency is\nmaking efforts to comply with regulations; however, most of these are repeat\nviolations that will require a corrective action plan to address this.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\nJuly 12, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 13, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
