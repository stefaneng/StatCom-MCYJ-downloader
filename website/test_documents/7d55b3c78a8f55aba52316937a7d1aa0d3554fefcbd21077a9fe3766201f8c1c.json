    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10157 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) A facility shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures that address all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical and dental care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation This past Friday, youth was stressed out and beat her head on a\nbrick wall gashing it open. Youth's parents were notified that it was\na small cut. On Saturday, youth was observed with a wound that\nwas concerning. After requests made, youth was sent to Zeeland\nhospital. Upon evaluation it was determined that if youth would\nhave been seen on Friday that she would have received staples\nfor the wound. Today youth hit her own head on a sink and has\nopened her original wound. Youth was assessed by medical staff\nat the facility, and it was assessed youth did not need staples.\nThere is a concern that youth may be assessed incorrectly due to\nthe incident that previously took place with youth not going to the\nhospital during the first incident. There is additional concern that\nyouth continues to harm herself and that she will injure herself\nseverely while in the care of the detention center.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nYouth A’s Father (Father) was interviewed via phone on\n2/24/25. Father reported when Youth A gets overwhelmed or\nstressed, she bangs her head on things, and this reaction has\nbeen happening since she was a toddler. Father reported he\nreceived a call from Supervisor 2 late on 2/14/25 (about 3-4 hours\nafter the incident occurred) that Youth A hit her head on the brick\nwall out of frustration. Father reported he was told it resulted in a\nminor cut on her head, which did not require medical services.\nFather reported he didn’t think anything more of it and proceeded\nwith his weekly Saturday evening visit on 2/15/25. Father reported\nin the afternoon on 2/15/25, Youth A called him and reported she\nhad been trying to get a hold of him for days, and through the\nbehavior rewards program, she purchased a phone call to speak\nwith him on 2/13/25. Father reported Youth A said she told staff it\nwas very urgent she speak with him, but she wasn’t granted a\nphone call. Father reported Youth A told him she banged her head\non 2/14/25 and if staff would have listened to her and let her talk\nto him, she wouldn’t have banged her head. Father reported it is\nwell known by all employees at the facility Youth A is not well as\nshe is a repeat offender for doing the same thing recurrently.\nFather reported when he went to visit Youth A at the facility in the\nevening on 2/15/25, Youth A had her hair parted to the side.\nFather said when she moved her hair over, he saw a ½ inch gash\n2",
    "on the top of her head and took a picture. Father reported as soon\nas he saw the mark on her head, he made a scene and\ndemanded she be seen at the hospital because the injury clearly\nneeded staples. Father reported although he’s not a medical\nprofessional, it was clear to him the wound was large enough and\ndeep enough, it needed to be physically closed to heal. Father\nreported he was referred to speak to Nurse 1 as she was the one\nwho treated Youth A on 2/14/25. Father reported Nurse 1 was the\nmost arrogant, sarcastic medical professional he’s ever spoken to\nin his life. Father reported Nurse 1 defended her position to not\nsend Youth A to the hospital on 2/14/25, and with a smile on her\nface said, “I’m the medical professional, not you”. Father reported\nhe left the visitation, went to the parking lot, and immediately\ncalled the Sherriff’s Department. Father reported he met with an\nofficer in the parking lot and the officer told him the situation was\nout of their hands because it’s a separate entity. Father reported\nthe officer connected him with the Chief Administrator (CA) of the\nfacility. Father reported he was in the parking lot dealing with this\nfor approximately 4-5 hours going back and forth with CA. Father\nreported CA told him he needed authorization from the medical\nstaff to take Youth A to the hospital and he was working on\nobtaining the authorization. Father reported at approximately 1:00\nAM on 2/16/25, the facility finally brought Youth A to Zeeland\nHospital, and he met them there. Father reported Staff 1\naccompanied Youth A to the hospital and was in the room with\nthem while Doctor assessed Youth A’s injury. Father reported\nafter the assessment, Doctor stated since the wound was almost 2\ndays old, and it had already begun to scab over, it would not be\nwise to pick the scab open to use glue or stitches to close it.\nFather reported Doctor said if Youth A had been taken to the\nemergency room on 2/14/25 after the incident occurred, he would\nhave most definitely used staples to close the wound. Father\nreported Doctor said if Youth A had received staples, she would\nhave been able to regrow hair in that spot, but because she didn’t\nreceive staples, the likeliness of hair regrowth in the area was\nzero.\nFather reported on 2/19/25, he received a phone call from\nSupervisor 3 informing him Youth A hit her head on the sink in her\nroom, reopened the wound and there was no longer a scab.\nFather asked why Youth A wasn’t being taken to the hospital to\nreceive staples this time. For the next couple hours, Father spoke\nto nursing staff. Father reported Nurse 1 was the nurse who\ncompleted the initial evaluation and assessment for this incident,\nand she was the same nurse who completed the assessment on\n2/14/25. Father reported he wanted a second opinion, and the\n3",
    "head nurse (couldn’t remember her name) backed up Nurse 1’s\nassessment. Father reported he was told multiple nurses had\nexamined her and all concluded Youth A did not need further\nmedical treatment.\nFather reported on 2/21/25, he was called and told Youth A hit her\nhead again. Father reported he saw her on 2/22/25 and Youth A\nonly had a very small wound on her head, so he understood why\nshe wasn’t taken to the hospital that time.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 2/24/25.\nYouth A reported when she gets upset, she bangs her head on\nwhatever is near her or available, and this has been happening\nsince way before she came to the facility. Youth A reported when\nshe bangs her head, she is fully aware of what she is doing and\nthe consequences of doing it. Youth A reported she is not sure\nhow she feels about the medical treatment at the facility. Youth A\nreported it’s hit or miss whether you get a nurse who shows\ngenuine care/concern and wants to help (i.e. Nurse 3) or whether\nyou get a nurse who doesn’t care and seems to just be there for\nthe money (i.e. Nurse 1).\nYouth A reported on 2/14/25 she was upset and wanted to talk to\nFather. Youth A reported she asked staff (couldn’t remember who)\nto talk to Father because she was upset, and said if she couldn’t\ntalk to him, she was going to hurt herself. Youth A reported\napproximately 10 minutes later, she began banging her head and\nshe banged her head for about 10 minutes straight. Youth A\nreported Staff 3 entered the room, saw Youth A bleeding, and\nwent to get a supervisor. Youth A reported within minutes,\nSupervisor 2 and Staff 3 entered the room. Supervisor 2 contacted\nnursing and requested someone come assess Youth A. Youth A\nreported Nurse 1 met with her and said there was a gash at the\nfront of her hairline. Youth A reported Nurse 1 cleaned the wound\nand said nothing else needed to be done. Youth A reported Nurse\n1 asked Supervisor 2 if he thought it needed to be glued, and they\nboth concluded it didn’t need to be. Youth A reported they left the\nroom, and she went to sleep. Youth A reported the next morning\n(2/15/25), she was still feeling upset, but it wasn’t as bad, so she\nwent about her day. Youth A reported Father came to visit her at\napproximately 7:30 PM. Youth A reported Father saw the injury on\nher head and he became angry because he said the injury looked\nbad, and worse than what Supervisor 2 told him over the phone.\nYouth A reported Father told her she should have received\nstitches. Youth A reported Father complained to the staff\n(unknown) who was in the visitation room, and then said he was\n4",
    "going to call the cops and get an ambulance to come to the facility\nand assess her. Youth A reported Father felt they were medically\nneglecting her treatment. Youth A reported around midnight on\n2/16/25, she was taken by ambulance to the hospital and was\nescorted by Staff 1. Youth A reported Father met them at the\nhospital. Youth A reported at the hospital, Doctor said if Youth A\nwould have come to the hospital on 2/14/25, she would have\nreceived stitches. However, now it was too late for Youth A to get\nstitches because the wound was already scabbing over, and if\nDoctor opened the wound to give her stitches, it would have\ngotten infected. Youth A reported Doctor gave her bacterial\nointment to take with her, but that’s all he did.\nYouth A reported on 2/19/25, she became upset and banged her\nhead on the sink in her room. Youth A reported Staff 4 came to do\nchecks around 9:45-10:00 PM and she told Staff 4 she felt like\nhurting herself and wanted to die. Youth A reported she told Staff\n4 she needed to talk to someone. Youth A reported Staff 4 said,\n“No don’t say that. I have to go right now to finish my checks”, and\nthen he left. Youth A reported no one came to talk to her or check\non her, so she banged her head because she was still upset.\nYouth A reported approximately 15 minutes after Staff 4 came,\nStaff 2 came to complete a check and didn’t seem to know Youth\nA was upset or what was going on. Youth A reported Staff 2 asked\nif she needed to talk to someone and she said yes. Youth A\nreported shortly after, Supervisor 1 came to talk to her, and she\ntold Supervisor 1 about Staff 4. Youth A reported Supervisor 1\ncalled Nurse 3 to come assess her head because she re-opened\nthe same wound from 2/14/25. Youth A reported Nurse 3 cleaned\nthe wound and said it was fine. Youth A reported on 2/20/25,\nFather came to visit her and said the wound was looking better.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 2/24/25. CA reported he spoke with Father on 2/15/25\nafter Father had visitation with Youth A. Father stated he wasn’t\nleaving the facility grounds until Youth A went to the hospital. CA\nreported he spoke with Nurse 1 and Nurse Supervisor and they\nboth reported there was no medical reason for Youth A to go to\nthe hospital. Nurse 1 and Nurse Supervisor reported if CA wanted\nto send her to the hospital anyways, they would approve it. CA\nreported he asked for the approval, it was provided, and Youth A\nwas sent to the hospital via ambulance.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 3/6/25. Staff 1 reported\nshe works 3rd shift and was on shift for the early morning hours of\n2/16/25, and she accompanied Youth A to the hospital. Staff 1\n5",
    "reported Youth A bangs her head frequently when stressed. Staff\n1 reported Father felt Youth A needed to go to the hospital to get\nstitches, so the facility followed through at Father’s request. Staff 1\nreported Doctor said everything with Youth A’s wound looked\ngood. Doctor said he didn’t want to open the wound to give Youth\nA stitches because opening the scab would leave the wound at\nmore risk for infection. Doctor reported if Youth A was brought to\nthe emergency room on 2/14/25, he likely would have put in\nstitches. However, Doctor reported how the wound was cared for\nwas sufficient and didn’t have any concerns about Youth A not\ngoing to the hospital on 2/14/25. Staff 1 reported Doctor said\nYouth A may have more trouble growing hair in the area without\nhaving stitches, but regardless of the treatment, Youth A would\nhave a scar indefinitely. Staff 1 reported after Doctor said this,\nFather said, “you heard she won’t be able to grow hair there now,\nright?”. Staff 1 reported Doctor never said Youth A couldn’t grow\nhair in the area, but said she would have trouble growing hair\nthere. Staff 1 reported nursing at the facility has told Youth A\nrepeatedly if she continues to bang her head, she will continue to\nre-open the wound and continue to have a scar. Staff 1 reported\nDoctor provided Youth A with anti-bacterial ointment.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 3/21/25. Staff 2 reported\non 2/19/25, he went to complete checks, and he found Youth A on\nher bed crying. Staff 2 reported he asked Youth A if she needed\nanything, and Youth A stated she wanted to speak with someone.\nStaff 2 reported he needed to finish checks, so he let Supervisor 1\nknow Youth A wanted to speak with someone. Staff 2 reported\nSupervisor 1 talked to Youth A, but Staff 2 wasn’t present for the\nconversation. Staff 2 reported when she saw Youth A, she was\nnot banging her head. Staff 2 reported when he saw Youth A,\nthere was no blood on the wall or on her head.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 3/20/25. Staff 3 reported\non 2/14/25, Youth A took a time-out during the middle of gym\nclass because she was upset over not getting a phone call with\nFather. Staff 3 reported Youth A was informed staff were busy and\nwere not able to take the time to make a phone call with her at\nthat time. Staff 3 reported the camera for Youth A’s room kept\nglitching on the control board. Staff 3 reported she then listened to\nthe speaker in Youth A’s room and heard Youth A say something\nabout wanting to kill herself, so Staff 3 went to check on Youth A.\nStaff 3 reported as she approached Youth A’s room, she heard\nbanging and crying. Staff 3 reported she witnessed Youth A\nbanging her head, so Staff 3 verbally de-escalated her and tried to\nfind out what was going on. Staff 3 reported Youth A was trying to\n6",
    "respond but wasn’t forming coherent sentences. Staff 3 reported\nshe went to get Supervisor 2, informed him what was happening,\nand then retrieved sanitary items to take care of Youth A’s wound\nand the blood on the wall. Staff 3 reported when she returned to\nYouth A’s room, Youth A expressed she was upset with herself\nbecause she hadn’t banged her head in a while. Staff 3 reported\nshe gave Youth A some paper towels and asked her to keep\npressure on the wound. Staff 3 reported she cleaned the wall\nwhile she talked to Youth A. Staff 3 reported Youth A said she was\ninitially upset about not being able to make a phone call, but said\nthere was something else too (didn’t say what). Staff 3 reported\ncontinued to talk to her until Supervisor 2 came to the room.\nSupervisor 2 instructed Staff 3 to take Youth A to the small\nconference room to meet with nursing, so Staff 3 did. Staff 3\nreported the gash on Youth A’s head looked pretty deep, but it\nwas hard to tell because there was blood all around it and it wasn’t\nclean. Staff 3 reported she did not see the wound once Nurse 3\ncleaned it because she left the room as soon as Nurse 3 entered\nthe room to treat Youth A.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 3/26/25. Staff 4 reported\nhe saw Youth A on 2/19/25 while he was doing checks. Staff 4\nreported Youth A was crying, and she had been crying for several\nhours at that point. Staff 4 reported Youth A never said she\nwanted to die or kill herself. Staff 4 reported he did his check, but\nhe didn’t interact with her. Staff 4 reported all staff and supervisors\nwere aware of Youth A being upset since she had been crying for\nso long.\nNurse 1 was interviewed via phone on 3/24/25. Nurse 1\nreported Youth A has a history of hitting her head ever since she\nwas a toddler and the whole area is hit up from the repeated\ntrauma. She reported there’s been an ongoing issue with Youth A\nbanging her head multiple times over a 2-week period. Nurse 1\nreported Youth A was seen by multiple nurses at the facility,\nPhysician Assistant, the emergency room, etc. Nurse 1 reported\non 2/14/25, she was called because Youth A banged her head on\nthe wall. Nurse 1 reported she assessed Youth A’s wound,\ncompleted a neuro check, and took her vitals. Nurse 1 reported\nYouth A had a small abrasion to the center-top-front of Youth A’s\nhairline. Nurse 1 reported the injury wasn’t deep or wide enough\nto need sutures. Nurse 1 reported she cleaned the wound and put\non steri-strips to cover it. Nurse 1 reported there was no way to\nput a band aid on the wound because it was in Youth A’s hair, and\nthey do not have access to skin glue at the facility. Nurse 1\nreported she educated Youth A on coping skills, told Youth A not\n7",
    "to pick at it or mess with it, and told Youth A how to care for the\nwound to prevent infection. Nurse 1 reported Youth A has a\nhistory of picking wounds. Nurse 1 reported she wasn’t present on\n2/15/25, but Nurse 1 was told Nurse 4 saw Youth A on 2/15/25\nbecause Youth A had been picking at and messing with the\nwound. Nurse 1 reported Father saw Youth A the evening of\n2/15/25, and she wasn’t sure how the wound changed between\n2/14/25 and 2/15/25 when Father saw her and Youth A went to\nthe hospital. Nurse 1 reported she has worked in emergency\nrooms before and has the knowledge/background to assess\nwhether a wound needs sutures or not. Nurse 1 reported she was\npositive the wound she assessed on 2/14/25 did not require\nsutures. Nurse 1 reported the next time she saw Youth A was on\n2/19/25 because Youth A banged her head on the sink in her\nroom and the wound reopened. Nurse 1 reported the wound\nlooked completely different on 2/19/25 than it did on 2/14/25.\nNurse 1 reported it had various stages of healing and looked more\nlike Youth A had dug into it or picked at it because it no longer\nlooked like a straight line and was more pitted out. Nurse 1\nreported Father was not happy with her assessing Youth A again\non 2/19/24, so Nurse 2 was asked to complete a second opinion.\nNurse 2 agreed Youth A did not need to go to the hospital to treat\nthe wound.\nNurse 2 was interviewed via phone on 3/24/25. Nurse 2\nreported on 2/19/25 she was called for a second opinion to look at\nthe wound on Youth A’s head because Father was not pleased\nwith the first opinion provided. Nurse 2 reported she didn’t\nremember who provided the first opinion. Nurse 2 reported Youth\nA had a cut on her head, but it was clean, and it was not an open\nwound needing medical attention. Nurse 2 agreed with the first\nopinion and concluded Youth A did not require outside medical\nattention.\nNurse 3 was interviewed via phone on 3/18/25. Nurse 3\nreported she was called by Supervisor 1 to address Youth A’s\nwound after Youth A banged her head on the sink in her room.\nNurse 3 reported she could not remember the exact date she was\ncalled because Youth A has reopened the same wound multiple\ntimes due to her repeated head banging. Nurse 3 reported Youth\nA also frequently picks at scabs and reopens them. Nurse 3\nreported she cleaned Youth A’s wound, put Bacitracin ointment on\nit, and explained the side effects to Youth A if Youth A continues\nto bang her head. Nurse 3 reported there was no reason to send\nYouth A to the hospital for treatment because the wound was not\nbig or deep enough to warrant further care.\n8",
    "Nurse 4 was interviewed via phone on 3/24/25. Nurse 4\nreported she saw Youth A on 2/15/25 because Youth A had been\npicking at the wound on her head. Nurse 4 reported Youth A’s\nhead wound is never going to go away or fully heal because Youth\nA keeps banging her head in the same spot, keeps picking at the\nwound, and keeps reopening it. Nurse 4 reported the tissue\nintegrity of the wound has been broken down so much, there’s no\npossible way for it to heal fully. Nurse 4 reported when she saw\nYouth A on 2/15/25, the head wound was not wide open and was\nnot bleeding. Nurse 4 reported the wound was a little open from\nYouth A picking at it, but there was nothing that could be done.\nYouth A denied being in any pain. Nurse 4 reported she couldn’t\nput a band aid on the wound because it is on Youth A’s hair line\nand the band aid would not stick. Nurse 4 reported she offered\nYouth A steri-strips to cover the wound, but Youth A declined the\nsteri-strips because she said she always just takes them off\nanyways. Youth A accepted Nurse 4 putting Bacitracin ointment\non the wound, but that was all that was done. Nurse 4 reported\nshe educated Youth A on how to care for the wound, went over\nappropriate coping skills with her, and discussed the reasons\nYouth A needed to stop picking at the wound.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via phone on 3/6/25. Supervisor\n1 reported she wasn’t involved in the incident on 2/19/25 when\nYouth A banged her head on the sink. However, Supervisor 1\nreported she was involved in an incident on 2/21/25 where Youth\nA also banged her head on the sink in her room. Supervisor 1\nreported she went to speak with Youth A per Youth A’s request.\nSupervisor 1 reported when she got to the room, Youth A had\nalready banged her head on the sink, and it looked like Youth A\nknocked the scab on the wound loose. Supervisor 1 reported\nNurse 3 came to assess the injury. Nurse 3 treated the wound\nwith saline, gauze, and Bacitracin ointment. Nurse 3 educated\nYouth A to stop picking at the wound, keep her fingers away from\nthe wound, let it heal, and provided her with some coping skills.\nNurse 3 reported she didn’t put steri-strips on the wound because\nof Youth A’s history of removing the steri-strips and picking at\nscabs.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via phone on 3/26/25. Supervisor\n2 reported Youth A’s coping skill for when she is upset is to hit her\nhead against something, not for the purpose of self-harm, but\nmore for release. Supervisor 2 reported on 2/14/25, he was\nmeeting with another youth when Staff 3 informed him Youth A\nwas bleeding from the top of her head. Supervisor 2 reported\n9",
    "Youth A has an existing scar on the spot due to the wound\ncontinuously being reopened from trauma and Youth A picking at\nit. Supervisor 2 reported Youth A is constantly told not to pick at\nthe wound, but she does anyways. Supervisor 2 reported Youth A\nhad blood on her head and there was blood on the wall.\nSupervisor 2 reported she instructed Staff 3 what cleaning stuff to\nget. Supervisor 2 contacted nursing and requested assistance.\nNurse 3 reported and Supervisor 2 told her what happened.\nSupervisor 2 reported it is not his position to make the call\nwhether to send a youth out for hospital care unless the injury or\nsituation is life-threatening. Supervisor 2 reported Nurse 3 cleaned\nYouth A’s wound and put steri-strips on it. Supervisor 2 reported\nNurse 3 instructed Youth A not to remove the steri-strips and not\nto pick at the wound, so it could heal properly. Supervisor 2\nreported Youth A ended up picking off the steri-strips and picked\nat the wound within the next few days and admitted she did so to\nstaff. Supervisor 2 reported on 2/15/25, Father visited Youth A at\nthe facility, and he was not happy with the medical care Youth A\nreceived. Father felt the wound was larger and more open than he\nwas told on the phone and felt she should have been sent to the\nhospital to treat it.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Picture of Youth A’s wound dated 2/15/25 was obtained\nfrom Father.\n• Incident report dated 2/14/25 authored by Supervisor 2 and\nStaff 3 was consistent with their interviews.\n• Corewell Health Zeeland Emergency Room paperwork\ndated 2/16/25 authored by Doctor states Youth A was seen\ndue to a small scalp laceration that happened on 2/14/25.\nWound (approximately 1 cm) is already healing, and Doctor\ndid not feel staples should be placed at the time of the ER\nvisit. Doctor noted there would be greater risk for infection if\nstaples were placed. Doctor discussed with Father if Youth\nA presented on the day of the laceration, the ER would\nhave likely placed 1-2 staples. Doctor recommended topical\nantibiotic ointment. Doctor advised Youth A would likely\nhave a small scar in the area and may have some difficulty\ngrowing hair from that area. Doctor discussed this would\nhave likely been the result regardless of when Youth A\nwent to the hospital. Recommended ointment be applied\ntwice daily for the next 7-10 days.\n10",
    "• Incident report dated 2/16/25 authored by Supervisor 1 and\nStaff 5. Youth A had visitation with Father on 2/15/25.\nFather expressed to Staff 5 he was not satisfied with the\nlevel of medical care Youth A received following the\nincident on 2/14/25. Father stated Youth A not having\nstitches was unacceptable. Father was vocal and\nantagonistic, swearing, and being disrespectful towards\nStaff 5. Father met with Nurse 1 and scolded Nurse 1 like a\nchild. The rest of the report was consistent with CA,\nSupervisor 2, and Nurse 1’s interviews.\n• Incident report dated 2/19/25 authored by Supervisor 3.\nSupervisor 3 reported to Youth A’s room due to Youth A’s\nhead bleeding. Youth A reported she hit her head on the\nsink, which caused the top of her forehead to bleed.\nSupervisor 2 attempted to contact medical at 8:23 PM but\nthere was no answer. CA was notified of event. Supervisor\n3 called medical again at 8:51 PM. Nurse 1 responded and\nthen came to assess Youth A. Nurse 1 cleaned the wound\nand put anti-bacterial ointment on it. Supervisor 3 brought\nYouth A ice to put on the wound. Supervisor 2 called Father\nand informed him of the incident. Father was angry and\ndisappointed by the medical care Youth A was receiving at\nthe facility. Supervisor 3 spoke with Father and Father\nexpressed he felt Youth A should go to the hospital.\nSupervisor 3 offered for another nurse to evaluate the\nwound, and Father agreed. Nurse 2 arrived and assessed\nthe wound. Nurse 2 reported wound was intact, not\nbleeding and just needed anti-bacterial ointment moving\nforward. Supervisor 3 notified Father of the result and\nFather was unhappy, so his number was provided to Nurse\nSupervisor.\n• Nursing notes 2/14/25-2/21/25:\no 2/14/25 at 8:00 PM – Nurse 1 responded to incident\nof Youth A banging her head on the wall.
