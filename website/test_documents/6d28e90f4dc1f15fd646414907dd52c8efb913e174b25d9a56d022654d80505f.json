    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4129 Institutions serving developmentally\nSection disabled youth; written procedures.\nDescription (1) An institution providing care to developmentally disabled\nresidents shall require staff to follow written procedures for\nbathing, feeding, toilet training, and daily activities of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff won't check a youth’s brief before they go to bed. Staff has\nsaid to just let the overnight staff worry about it. This has\nhappened on several occasions.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 3/4/24.\nComplainant reported she received the complaint from an\nanonymous source and did not have any contact information for\nthe person who made the complaint. Complainant reported there\nwere no youth or staff names associated to this allegation. Since\nthe original complaint source was anonymous and no contact\ninformation was provided, no further details could be requested.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 3/5/24 and via phone on 4/10/24. CA reported it is\nobvious when a youth has soiled their briefs, and she hasn’t heard\nabout or received complaints about any staff neglecting to change\na youth’s briefs before they go to bed. CA reported Youth A was at\nthe facility until 1/23/24 and he wore briefs all day/night. CA\nreported Youth B only wears briefs at night. CA reported Youth C\nand Youth D wear briefs all day/night. CA reported because the\nyouth are teenagers, it is not appropriate for staff members to be\nrandomly checking youth’s briefs as a standard practice. However,\neach youth in briefs has an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) plan\nand/or a bathroom protocol. Part of each youth’s ADL is to take\nthem to the bathroom before bed, and it is expected staff would\nchange a youth’s brief at that time. CA reported all staff receive\non-going training and feedback about bathroom protocols and\nADLs from BCBA (Board-Certified Behavior Analyst) staff during\nfrequent observations of staff & youth interactions and data\ncollection throughout their employment.\nStaff 1, Staff 4, Staff 5, Staff 6, Staff 8, Staff 9, Staff 10, Staff\n11, Staff 12, and Program Manager were all interviewed face\nto face separately at the facility on 3/7/24. Staff 13 was\ninterviewed via phone on 3/12/24. All staff reported they haven’t\nheard about or witnessed any staff neglecting any youths’\n2",
    "bathroom needs or neglecting to change their briefs and leaving it\nfor the next shift.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 2 reported she has never heard about or witnessed any staff\nneglecting any youths’ bathroom needs or neglecting to change\ntheir briefs and leaving it for the next shift. Staff 2 reported if a\nyouth soils at the time of shift change, it might be left for third shift\nto take care of due to the natural transitions of staff, but not as an\nintentional act. Staff 2 could not provide any examples of youth or\nstaff who might have been involved in a situation like she\ndescribed.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 3 reported she has never heard about or witnessed any staff\nneglecting any youths’ bathroom needs or neglecting to change\ntheir briefs and leaving it for the next shift. Staff 3 reported the\nonly time she can see something like that occurring is if Youth C is\nescalated. Staff 3 reported when Youth C has behaviors, he\nrefuses to allow staff to check his brief, refuses to go to the\nbathroom when he’s soiled, etc. Staff 3 reported since staff are not\nallowed to physically take him to the bathroom, they are required\nto wait it out until he complies, which may naturally go from\nsecond to third shift if his behaviors last for a while.\nStaff 7 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 7 reported she has never heard about or witnessed any staff\nneglecting any youths’ bathroom needs or neglecting to change\ntheir briefs and leaving it for the next shift. Staff 7 reported there\nare times Youth B goes to sleep early, so his brief might not get\nchecked one more time before he goes to sleep, and they don’t\nwake him up after he’s already sleeping. Staff 7 reported this isn’t\na normal occurrence or something that’s done intentionally.\nStaff 14 was interviewed face to face at another facility on\n3/15/24. Staff 14 reported there was one instance months ago\nwhere she asked Staff 6 if he was going to change a youth’s brief\nbecause the youth might be wet, and Staff 6 said “Nah, third shift\ncan deal with it”. Staff 14 reported she cannot remember which\nyouth it was, who else was working, or when it occurred. Staff 14\nstated she never reported it as a concern, and it hasn’t been a\npattern of behavior she’s noticed.\nYouth A, Youth B, Youth D were unable to be interviewed\nbecause they are non-verbal.\n3",
    "Youth C was interviewed via phone on 4/17/24. Youth C reported\nstaff help him go to the bathroom and change his clothes and/or\nbrief when needed. Youth C would not or could not answer any\nother questions due to his limited skills because of his diagnosis.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• ADL (Activities of Daily Living) Policy states these plans\ninclude information on a youth’s bathing, toileting, feeding,\nand other individually identified needs. Assistance will be\nprovided by support and assessment, training, and/or\nongoing support. Staff are to follow the steps as described\nin the plan.\n• Youth A’s Bathroom Protocol dated 8/9/23 states Youth A\nshould be using the bathroom once every hour during\nwaking hours and staff should record bathroom trips on\ndaily data sheets.\n• Youth A’s January 2024 (Youth A moved from the facility\non 1/23/24) daily logs do not reflect any concerns about\nstaff not changing youth’s brief throughout the day as\nrequired.\n• Youth B’s Bathroom Protocol dated 9/1/23 states Youth B\nshould be using the bathroom once every 1.5 hours during\nwaking hours to gain independence with toileting.\n• Youth B does not have daily logs reflecting bathroom trips\nbecause he does not wear briefs during the day.\n• Youth C’s Bathroom Protocol dated 2/14/24 states Youth C\nshould be using the bathroom once every hour during\nwaking hours and staff should record bathroom trips on\ndaily data sheets.\n• Youth C’s January and February 2024 daily logs do not\nreflect any concerns about staff not changing youth’s brief\nthroughout the day as required.\n• Youth D’s Bathroom Protocol dated 2/13/23 states staff\nshould place any soiled clothing items in a nearby laundry\nhamper to be washed. Youth D should be using the\nbathroom once every 1.5 hours during waking hours. If\nYouth D independently asks to use the bathroom, staff will\nimmediately stop the current activity/demand and take him\n4",
    "to the bathroom. Enter information on the interval data\nsheet.\n• Youth D’s January and February 2024 daily logs do not\nreflect any concerns about staff not changing youth’s brief\nthroughout the day as required.\n• Staff 6 has five disciplinary actions in his employee file,\nunrelated to this investigation. Staff 6 received training on\nthe ADL policy during new hire orientation on 2/6/23,\n2/20/23 and 2/23/24. He also received more specific hands-\non training for ADLs during shadow and training shifts on\n2/28/23, 3/1/23, 3/7/23, 3/9/23 and 3/14/23.\n• Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, Staff 7, Staff 8, Staff\n9, Staff 10, Staff 11, Staff 12, Staff 13, Staff 14, and Staff\n15 received training on the ADL policy during their new\nemployee orientations and more specific hands-on training\nfor ADLs during shadow and training shifts. All these dates\nwere provided for each staff listed.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. There is no evidence to support any\nstaff failed to check any youth’s briefs before bed or left a youth’s\nbathroom needs for another shift to handle. The one concern Staff\n14 mentioned about Staff 6 is not documented anywhere, Staff 14\ndid not report it, the youth is unknown, and the exact timeframe is\nunknown.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff used blocking pads to push a youth into their room.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 3/4/24.\nComplainant reported she received the complaint from an\nanonymous source and did not have any contact information for\nthe person who made the complaint. Complainant reported this\nallegation was specific to Youth A, but there were no staff names\n5",
    "provided with the allegation. Since the original complaint source\nwas anonymous and no contact information was provided, no\nfurther details could be requested.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 3/5/24 and via phone on 4/10/24. CA reported\nblocking pads would be used if a youth was being aggressive\ntowards staff but shouldn’t ever be utilized to push a youth. CA\nreported she has never seen or heard of any staff members\nutilizing blocking pads to push Youth A into his room. CA reported\nall staff receive on-going training and feedback about Behavior\nSupport Plans (BSPs) from BCBA staff during frequent\nobservations of staff & youth interactions and data collection\nthroughout their employment.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 3/7/24. PM reported he has never heard of or seen any\nstaff utilize blocking pads to push Youth A into his room. PM\nreported he reviews all incident reports and hasn’t seen anything\nlike that mentioned on those reports either.\nStaff 1, Staff 2, Staff 4, Staff 6, Staff 7, Staff 8, Staff 9, Staff 10,\nand Staff 11 were all interviewed face to face separately at the\nfacility on 3/7/24. Staff 13 was interviewed via phone on\n3/12/24. All staff reported they have never heard of or seen any\nstaff utilize blocking pads to push Youth A into his room.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24\nand Staff 14 was interviewed face to face at a different facility\non 3/15/24. Both staff reported they have never heard of or seen\nany staff utilize blocking pads to push Youth A into his room. Both\nstaff reported Youth A prefers to be in his room, and it is very\nunlikely anyone would ever have to use force to get him to go into\nhis room.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 5 reported he has never heard of or seen any staff utilize\nblocking pads to push Youth A into his room. Staff 5 reported\nusing blocking pads to push a youth is strictly against the facility’s\nrestraint model and specifically a technique they’re trained not to\nuse. Staff 5 reported if something like that happened, it would be a\nrecipient’s rights complaint, and had he heard of/seen it, he would\nhave made the complaint himself.\nYouth A was unable to be interviewed because he is non-\nverbal.\n6",
    "DOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Blocking Pad Procedures outlines when and how to utilize\nblocking pads at the facility. It outlines what are appropriate\ntechniques when using the blocking pads. It says pushing,\nstriking, or shoving of someone with the pad is not allowed.\n• Great Lakes Center for Autism Treatment and Researched\nLicensed Settings Policy Regarding Discipline and\nBehavior Management states pushing a youth on any part\nof their body is prohibited.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. All employees interviewed reported\nthey have never seen or heard of any staff using a blocking pad to\npush Youth A into his room.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation One youth is fearful of staff, and this same staff ignores Behavior\nSupport Plans (BSP).\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 3/4/24.\nComplainant reported she received the complaint from an\nanonymous source and did not have any contact information for\nthe person who made the complaint. Complainant reported this\nallegation only provided a last name for a youth, but not the first\nname. Complainant reported there were no staff names provided\nwith the allegation. Since the original complaint source was\nanonymous and no contact information was provided, no further\ndetails could be requested.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 3/5/24. CA reported Youth B’s last name matches the\nComplainant’s information. CA reported Youth B has Angelman’s\nSyndrome, which means he is easy to excite and reacts better to\nvery happy and animated people. CA reported if he doesn’t like a\nstaff, it is very difficult for staff to regain rapport with him. CA\nreported Staff 4, Staff 5, Staff 6, Staff 9, Staff 13, and Staff 15\n7",
    "have all struggled in their interactions with Youth B. CA reported\nthey all have more of a flat affect or haven’t mastered a poker face\nand show more annoyance, which Youth B doesn’t react well to.\nCA reported although he doesn’t prefer them, none of them run\nhis any better or worse than anyone else and he doesn’t express\nor demonstrate fear towards any of them. CA reported there have\nbeen no complaints about any staff intentionally or blatantly\nignoring Youth B’s BSP. CA reported there have been no\ncomplaints about Youth B demonstrating or expressing fear\ntowards any staff.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 3/7/24. PM reported it is hard to discern fear for Youth\nB due to his diagnosis of Angelman’s Syndrome, which means he\nalmost always has a happy affect. PM reported there’s an ebb and\nflow for staff he likes and doesn’t like, but no staff stand out as a\nconsistent issue for him. PM reported he hasn’t seen Youth B\ndemonstrate or express anything towards any staff he would\nconsider as fear. PM reported he reviews all incident reports for\nthe facility and can’t think of any situations where there have been\nreports or complaints of any staff intentionally ignoring Youth B’s\nBSP. PM reported there are various staff who will make honest\nmistakes and might be provided feedback, but nothing significant.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 1 reported Youth B has never cowered, run away from, or\ndemonstrated any fear towards any staff. Staff 1 reported there\nare times in Youth B’s BSP, staff are instructed to ignore certain\nbehaviors, but he has never seen any staff willfully ignore Youth\nB’s BSP. Staff 1 reported if he saw or heard something like that,\nhe would correct the behavior.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 2 reported Youth B has never expressed or demonstrated\nany fear towards any staff. Staff 2 reported due to his diagnosis,\nYouth B is one who you would be able to determine very easily if\nhe was fearful because he is open with his emotions and whether\nhe likes/dislikes something or someone. Staff 2 reported she has\nnever seen or heard of any staff intentionally ignoring Youth B’s\nBSP. Staff 2 reported there are times outlined in Youth B’s BSP\nwhen staff are instructed to ignore him/his behaviors when his\nwristband is flipped to orange. Staff 2 reported there are times\nstaff forget to check his wristband and will engage with him when\nthey’re not supposed to, but it is random occurrences with various\nstaff, and are honest mistakes rather than willfully trying to negate\nhis BSP.\n8",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 3 reported she has not heard or seen Youth B demonstrate\nor express any fear towards any staff. Staff 3 reported Youth B is\nvery dramatic and expressive in his body language, so someone\nwho doesn’t know him well might think that translates into fear, but\nit might just be the way he’s expressing a need or dislike. Staff 3\nreported part of her job is treatment integrity, providing feedback\nto staff, modeling appropriate reactions, and demonstrating what a\nyouth’s treatment plan/BSP should look like. Staff 3 reported\nYouth B has an attention-maintained function, so it's difficult to\ndiscern if he doesn’t like a staff, is fearful of a staff, or doesn’t\nwant to listen to a staff. Staff 3 reported Youth B has some\npreferred staff, and it is very evident which staff he doesn’t prefer\nto be around. The staff Youth B doesn’t prefer are Staff 4, Staff 5,\nStaff 6, Staff 9, and Staff 13. Staff 3 reported all these staff\nstruggle in their interactions with him because they have a difficult\ntime implementing his BSP. Staff 3 reported Youth B’s BSP\nrequires a lot of “wait” strategies (i.e. waiting for him to be\nappropriate or improve behaviors), which can be difficult for some\nstaff to be patient and wait it out. Staff 3 reported she has given all\nthese staff feedback multiple times, and other employees have\nhad to provide them feedback as well. Staff 3 reported Youth B\nrequires a lot of attention, social reinforcement and excitement\nfrom staff based on his diagnosis. If he’s doing a great job, a staff\nmust almost throw a party for him, be very joyous and be a hype\nperson, which these identified staff struggle doing. Staff 3 reported\nshe doesn’t believe these staff are intentionally trying to violate\nYouth B’s BSP, but they struggle with implementation consistently\ndue to all the required components.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 4 reported he has not seen Youth B demonstrate or express\nany fear towards any staff, but he does express when he has\npreferred staff. Staff 4 reported Youth B makes it clear when he\ndoesn’t like a staff. Staff 4 reported Youth B doesn’t like him when\nhe gives Youth B his medications or when he helps Youth B with\ntransitions. Staff 4 reported even if another staff gives Youth B his\nmedications or a prompt, Youth B might still get upset and take it\nout on Staff 4 if he is present. Staff 4 reported Youth B’s BSP has\na 2-minute wait strategy after prompts are provided. Staff 4\nreported there are frequent times when Youth B yells at him, hits\nhim, knocks medications out of his hand, or throws a tablet at him\nwhen Staff 4 is waiting for Youth B to comply with a prompt. Staff\n4 reported when Youth B has those behaviors, Staff 4 will ask\nanother staff to come in and take over, while Staff 4 provides\n9",
    "back-up, if needed. Staff 4 reported there are other times when\nYouth B enters a room, sees Staff 4 and expresses he is happy to\nsee him by smiling at him and hugging him. Staff 4 reported he\nhas been working on developing a better relationship with Youth B\nover the last 9 months, and they have made a lot of progress.\nStaff 4 reported Youth B is one of the harder youths because he’s\nattention-seeking. Staff 4 reported when Youth B’s wristband is\nflipped to orange, it means a staff is supposed to ignore Youth B\ndue to his behaviors. Staff 4 reported there are times when he will\nenter a room and not notice the orange wristband, and Youth B\nwill react even more positively to Staff 4, so Staff 4 takes\nadvantage of the moments to build a positive relationship with\nYouth B. Staff 4 reported he doesn’t intentionally ignore the\nwristband or Youth B’s BSP but makes an honest mistake and\nforgets to check.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/7/24.\nStaff 5 reported he has not seen Youth B demonstrate or express\nany fear towards any staff, but he does express when he has\npreferred staff. Staff 5 reported Youth B normally doesn’t like him\nand expresses his dislike by swatting at Staff 5, gesturing for Staff\n5 to go away, flinching when Staff 5 comes near him, or crying\nwhen Staff 5 goes near Youth B. Staff 5 reported Youth B requires\nhigh energy and excitement from staff due to his diagnosis, and\nStaff 5 doesn’t provide that high excitement because it’s not his\nnormal personality/demeanor. Staff 5 reported there are staff who\ndon’t always follow Youth B’s BSP either because they’re not\ninformed, they’re apathetic, they take the path of least resistance,\nor they’re burned out. Staff 5 reported he feels he gets in trouble\nwhen he doesn’t follow a BSP but doesn’t feel others get in trouble\nas often. Staff 5 was unwilling to provide any names of staff or\nspecific examples but reported they’re mostly on first shift.\nStaff 6, Staff 7, Staff 8, Staff 9, Staff 10, Staff 11, and Staff 12\nwere interviewed face to face separately at the facility on\n3/7/24. All staff reported they have not seen Youth B demonstrate\nor express any fear towards any staff. They all reported he has\nstrong preferences for which staff he likes and dislikes. They all\nreported they have never seen any staff blatantly or intentionally\nignore or disregard Youth B’s BSP.\nStaff 13 was interviewed via phone on 3/14/24. Staff 13\nreported there are staff Youth B does not like, including her, but\nshe has never seen Youth B demonstrate or express any fear\ntowards any staff. Staff 13 reported when Youth B doesn’t like\nstaff, he demonstrates it by groaning, swatting at them,\n10",
    "whining/crying, throwing things at them, and/or trying to hit them.\nStaff 13 reported there are some days the same staff he disliked\nthe day before, he will suddenly respond well to, wave and say hi.\nStaff 13 reported she has never seen or heard of any staff\nintentionally ignoring Youth B’s BSP. Staff 13 reported there are\nvarious staff who might not go through the planned ignoring\nprocess they’re supposed to, but this is not a pattern for any\nspecific staff. Staff 13 reported Youth B loves attention, so even\nthe littlest bit of attention by a staff might unintentionally go against\nhis BSP at some point, but it’s typically an honest mistake.\nStaff 14 was interviewed face to face at another facility on\n3/15/24. Staff 14 reported she has seen Youth B react very poorly\nto Staff 15 and it is clear he doesn’t like her. Staff 14 could not\ndetermine if it would be considered fear or not. Staff 14 reported\nanytime Staff 15 is around Youth B, Youth B is crying, throwing\nthings at her, or aggressing towards her. Staff 14 reported he is\npreferential with staff, but those preferences may change day-to-\nday. Staff 14 reported she has never seen Youth B’s preference\ntowards Staff 15 change.\nYouth B was unable to be interviewed because he is non-\nverbal.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Great Lakes Center for Autism Treatment and Researched\nLicensed Settings Policy Regarding Discipline and\nBehavior Management states each youth will have a\nbehavior treatment plan developed that addresses how\nstaff are to respond to that individual’s target behavior.\nWhen a youth demonstrates a behavior not accounted for\nin the plan, or when the prescribed response cannot be\nimplemented, staff will be required to use their discretion as\nto how to respond to the behavior.
