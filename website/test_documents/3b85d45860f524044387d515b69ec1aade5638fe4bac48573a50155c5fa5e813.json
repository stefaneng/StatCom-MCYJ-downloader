INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Sufficiency of staff.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency's program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth presented to the hospital with suicidal ideations and has a\nplan for suicide. A safety plan was made and sent back to the\nfacility, but the facility is not able to provide 1:1 care.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nSocial Worker 1 was interviewed via telephone on October 30,\n2024. Social Worker 1 said she was the tele-med hospital social\nworker the overnight of October 21, 2024, into October 22, 2024.\nSocial Worker 1 said when she took over the case with Youth A\nthere were no facility staff present at the hospital with her. Social\nWorker 1 said she was not involved in conversations or decisions\nabout not needing facility staff present at the hospital. Social\nWorker 1 said she was told the facility was unable to provide\nadequate staffing to ensure Youth A’s safety plan was met\ntherefore she was to be in the emergency room overnight. Social\nWorker 1 said it was reported the facility would not have enough\nstaff for “a few days” but she was unsure what the staffing issues\nwere. Social Worker 1 said she was reaching out to the MDHHS\nWorker as they were noted as the guardian for Youth A to notify\nthem of the current situation. Social Worker 1 said she was not\nable to get in touch with the MDHHS Worker and therefore called\ncentralized intake.\nSocial Worker 2 was interviewed via telephone on November\n4, 2024. Social Worker 2 said she was the tele-med hospital social\nworker the evening of October 21, 2024, and worked with Youth A\non screening and safety planning.

    "met. Social Worker 2 said the Medical Technician was in contact\nwith her supervisor and reported that “within a day or two” they\nwould be able to have staff provide constant supervision which\nwould include having a staff within arm’s reach of Youth A at all\ntimes while awake, and while asleep have a staff sit outside Youth\nA’s door and complete five minute checks on her throughout the\nnight. Social Worker 2 said due to this information it was\ndetermined Youth A would spend the night in the hospital so that\nthe facility had time to increase staffing to meet the safety plan\nrequirements. Social Worker 2 said she never took part in a\nconversation regarding the hospital providing Youth A’s\nsupervision and facility staff not being needed at the hospital, but\nMedical Technician had stated she planned to stay with Youth A as\nlong as needed.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nNovember 18, 2024. Youth A said she was at the hospital “a few\nweeks ago” and Medical Technician was with her for part of the\ntime. Youth A said Medical Technician left due to not “being able to\ncount in ratio”. Youth A said she was left alone at the hospital for\n“a couple of hours”.

Medical Technician said she took Youth A to\nthe hospital for an assessment due to her suicidal statements.\nMedical Technician said she was in the room and Social Worker 2\nwas on a tablet, and Supervisor was on the phone when they did\nthe safety planning for Youth A. Medical Technician said Social\nWorker 2 wanted Youth A to have one-on-one staffing and\nSupervisor said they cannot provide one-on-one staffing due to\nratio and staffing however they would provide constant supervision\nof Youth A. Medical Technician said Social Worker 2 asked how\nlong the constant supervision would last and Supervisor had said\nhe cannot give a specific timeframe as it is based on the youth’s\nneeds and behaviors. Medical Technician said Social Worker 2\nsaid Youth A was to stay at the hospital and they were going to get\nin touch with Youth A’s Foster Care Worker. Medical Technician\nsaid once it was determined that Youth A was to stay overnight at\nthe emergency room, she was directed by Health Administrator to\nleave the hospital as they were going to place a staff in Youth A’s\nroom. Medical Technician said she told Director and left the\nhospital. Medical Technician said the following day she and Health\nAdministrator went back to the emergency room and picked Youth\n3",

Medical Technician said\nshe did not see the safety plan once back at the facility.\nSupervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nOctober 23, 2024. Supervisor said Medical Technician was at the\nhospital with Youth A on October 21, 2024. Supervisor said\nMedical Technician called him as she was working with Social\nWorker 2 on the safety plan for Youth A. Supervisor said Social\nWorker 2 was asking the facility to staff one-on-one for Youth A\nand he reported he told Medical Technician to tell the Social\nWorker 2 they could not provide one-on-one staff with Youth A\nhowever they would be able to provide constant supervision to her\nwhich would include staff having her in line-of-sight, and\nconducting five-minute checks on her at night.

Director said Therapist assessed Youth A for\nsuicidal statements and made the decision to have staff bring her\nto the hospital for further assessment.

Director\nsaid Medical Technician reached out to her to tell her and she then\nreached out to Health Administrator who told them they had to go\nback to the hospital and was told by Health Administrator that the\nhospital agreed to provide the supervision to Youth A and staff was\nnot needed.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed via telephone on\nNovember 6, 2024. Foster Care Worker said she received a\nvoicemail regarding Youth A’s hospitalization on October 21, 2024.\nFoster Care Worker said she spoke to someone from the hospital\nwho told her that River Oak staff reported that in order to have\nYouth A returned to the facility they needed one-on-one staffing.\nFoster Care Worker said she then spoke to the staff at River Oak\nwho reported they never told the hospital they needed one-on-one\nstaffing but rather the hospital said that was required for discharge\nof Youth A.

    "she has not had any concerns with River Oak program and\nreported they go above and beyond with Youth A.\nHealth Administrator was interviewed via telephone on\nNovember 25, 2024. Health Administrator reported most of her\nprior work has been in a hospital and she is familiar with hospital\nprotocols regarding youth that come in with mental health needs\nand the supervision the hospital provides for them. Health\nAdministrator said she was on the phone with Medical Technician\non October 21, 2024, while Youth A was in the emergency room.\nHealth Administrator said there was miscommunication in the\nterminology that was being used for Youth A’s safety plan which\nmade the hospital social worker decide to have Youth A remain in\nthe emergency room overnight. Health Administrator said she was\nnot included in the discussion about the terminology so is unsure\nof what the issue had been exactly. Health Administrator said once\nit was decided Youth A was going to stay in the emergency room\nfor the night, she spoke to the charge nurse who told her there\nwould be a “sitter” in Youth A’s room to ensure safety and doing\nten minutes charting. Health Administrator said she then spoke to\nDirector of Quality and explained to her that the hospital was\ngoing to provide a “sitter” and so felt the Medical Technician\nshould leave and it was not necessary to have another staff go to\nthe hospital to sit with Youth A as she would already have a\nhospital staff in the room the entire time. Health Administrator said\nDirector of Quality agreed so she told Medical Technician to leave\nthe hospital. Health Administrator said the following morning she\nand Medical Technician went to emergency room to get Youth A.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• River Oak Youth Center Suicide Prevention Plan Policy was\nreviewed.
