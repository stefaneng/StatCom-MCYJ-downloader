    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes.\n2.) The facility is in compliance with all additional ISEP requirements.\n3) The facility is in compliance with all DHHS contract/policy requirements except:\nRFCAN MISACWIS Restraint and Seclusion reporting complete and\nContract up to date\n2.10\nVista Maria is entering restraint/seclusion data into\nMISACWIS. MDHHS procedural changes as of 7/16/20\nrequire the data be entered into MISACWIS within 24 hours\nof each event. Vista Maria continues experiencing\ntechnical difficulties. Restraint/seclusion entries are not\nshowing up on the restraint/seclusion summary report\npulled monthly by the DCWL analyst. Additionally currently\nerror messages occur when reports are routed for approval\nand debriefing details will not save. MISACWIS HELP\nDESK tickets are currently open to resolve these issues.\n(repeat non-compliance 2019 - three Vista Maria CCI\nlicenses that use restraint/seclusion)\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nNew MISACWIS screens were added related to notifications and debriefing on\nrestraints/seclusion incident reporting. New procedures for saving and sending\nincident reports to the DCWL mailbox were reviewed.\nPA 116 definition of “personal restraint” and what is not “personal restraint” was\ndiscussed (ie, escorts).\n4",
    "EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThe facility uses one CPI restraint technique referred to as the standing two-\nperson control hold. No other techniques are approved by DCWL or sanctioned\nby the agency. Use of other techniques resulted in a resident restraint violation.\nThe DCWL procedure for pulling clearances and criminal records changed in\n2019. 2020 CR clearances and Ichats were not present in employee files during\nthe on-site review.\nThe facility’s use of restraint and seclusion decreased by approximately 65%\nfrom the numbers reported in 2019.\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care in two years.\nThere was one violation of Discipline involving corporal punishment in two years.\nThe facility submitted 11 acceptable corrective action plans resulting from special\ninvestigations in the past two years. Rule violations included:\nR 400.4109 Program statement (X 4) – Not following Vista Maria policy\nR 400.4112 Staff qualifications (X 4) – Staff inability/inexperience to perform job duties\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff (X 2) – Inadequate staff supervision\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio (X2) – Out of ratio\nR 400.4142 Health services (X 2) – Routine and emergency medical treatment\nR 400.4158 Discipline (X 2) – Inappropriate discipline\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint (X 4) – Improper restraint technique used\nOn 7/23/20, the facility submitted 1 NEW corrective action plan for earlier\nviolations of R 112, 158 and 159 for which the previously approved CAPs were\ndeemed insufficient. This NEW CAP was approved and fully implemented in\nAugust 2020.\n5",
    "V. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended this license be\nRenewed to Regular.\nAugust 12, 2020\n_______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 13, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
