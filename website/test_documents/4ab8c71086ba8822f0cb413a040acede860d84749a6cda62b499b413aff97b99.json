    "Allegation Youth was not seen by medical after restraint. Youth had a bloody\nnose and neck pain.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nStaff 1 reported it is everyone’s job to make sure that a youth goes\nto the hospital if there is imminent danger to the youth.

This is the first report to writer.\nPer youth, restrained by Staff 1 over and over again with chest\nand face down on his bed was then “choked” Staff 1 had this\nyouth in a chokehold per his report.”\nI reviewed the Trident Care Medical Documentation dated\n10/20/23:\n8",
    "There was no “acute fracture or dislocation. Nasal septum intact\nand midline. Soft tissue normal. Sinuses clear.”\nAnalysis Youth A was not seen after he was restrained on 10/13/23\nalthough he suffered injuries. All staff and youth reported that he\nreceived a bloody nose from the incident.

Staff 1 reported that staff would write an incident\nreport and then all that were involved would complete a write up\nand provide this to the facility manager. Staff 1 reported that\n9",
    "sometimes the facility manager completes the incident reports for\nthem though. Staff 1 then changed this process and stated that\nstaff do not write the incident report. They can choose to do so\nvoluntarily or of the facility manager asks them to do this, but it is\nthe normal function of the facility manager. Staff 1 reported he did\nnot write an incident report or anything else for the incident. Staff 1\nreported that on 10/18/23, Supervisor 1 came to him and told him\nto write up something for the specific date. Staff 1 is not the author\nof the incident report.\nSupervisor 1 reported he never write an incident report because\nhe thought what happened could be debriefed verbally and did not\nthink it rose to incident report writing. It was only “informational.”\nDocumentation:\nThe Unusual and Critical Incident Policy was reviewed:\nAll SJJS employees and volunteers are responsible for\ndocumenting any and all Unusual (out of the ordinary) Incident\ninvolving youth.

If there are\nstaff that do not have clearances completed, they are to be\nremoved from the schedule until clearances are completed and\napproved.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nInterim Inspection 6/14/23\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4131 Compliance with child protection law;\nSection development of plan required\nDescription (1) The licensee shall develop and implement a written plan to\nassure compliance with the child protection law, 1975 PA 238,\nMCL 722.621 to 722.638.\n11",
