EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one corrective plan during this reporting period under\nreview. The corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024 renewal inspection\nwhere it received 22 rule violations, where 7 were repeat violations. During this\n2025 Interim inspection the agency received 19 rule violations and 10 are repeat\nviolations from 2024. The agency compliance around the 10 is as follows: the\nnumber of individual cases cited decreased for 7 of these rules:( R400.12405(5)(a)\n&(b) from 6 of 6, to 1 of 4; R400.12417(1)(c) -(g) from 3 of 6 to 2 of 6). The\nnumber of individual cases cited remained the same for the other 3 rules:\nR400.12413(1)(d) being 1 of 6; R400.12419(1)(c) being 2 of 6; and R400.12507(1)\nbeing 1 of 3).\nThe agency implemented all action steps within its 2024 corrective action plan.\nThe agency reported the corrective action plan was helpful. They continue\nefforts to have staff understand and to comply with all rules.\n8",
    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 10/15/2025(signed\n8/22/25). The chief administrator (CA) reported on the prior year's inspection\nviolations, and the action steps it put in place to achieve compliance. The CA\nreported the main barrier impacting compliance over the past review period was\nsupervisory staffing changes due to retirements, medical leave of absences, and\nstaff changes from the local office to a central location. Washtenaw was allowed to\nborrow a supervisor from another County to assist, which was helpful, as the staff\nperson did a fantastic job. The CA further reported that their focus on the\ncorrective action plan was regularly with the foster care and licensing staff.\nAdditionally, the staff and supervisors utilized the CAP as a tool; and having the\ncorrective action plan as a standing agenda item for their foster care monthly\nprogram meeting helped the foster care staff implement compliance around the\ncited areas. The CA indicated the corrective action plan activities that had a\npositive impact was licensing and foster care supervisors meeting regularly with\nstaff to review the items cited. The agency indicated a plan to continue to work\ntoward compliance in all areas; and to continue to education its staff around all\nareas, with focus on repeat citations and missed information.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, section manager, and two\nsupervisors during the entrance conference, two foster care workers and one\nlicensing worker were interviewed. The staff interviewed reported various\nstrengths and attributes for the agency; which included supportive upper\nmanagement, team support; the administrators understanding workers’ stress and\npersonal issues and giving emotional support; and the district manager stepping in\nto help when needed. Areas of need reported included gaining more staff; case\nassistance with uploading documents; offering uber services to clients to help\nthem with their transportation needs; streamlining and decreasing some\nchecklists; safety discussions; more discussions around when a child from a\nworker’s caseload is replaced from a foster home to a shelter; and supervisors\nworking together more as a unified team.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through the agency's office did not reveal any areas of concern. There was\nsufficient space and equipment for employees, and files were properly secured\nand stored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one safety alert identified.\nSafety Alert: The Division of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL) Analyst made\nattempts to connect with the caregiver on 7/16/2025 and 7/30/2025. After no reply\nfrom the caregiver, the Analyst reached out to the agency as the safety of the child\n9",
    "and the caregiver’s home could not be assessed\nResolution: The agency worker made a home visit to the home on 8/4/2025 and the\nsafety of the child and the home was verified. The worker also discussed with the\ncaregiver the importance of returning the DCWL Analyst’s calls. The child was also\nseen on 8/6/2025 for parenting time and the child’s well-being was again confirmed.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nOctober 31,2025\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 31, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
