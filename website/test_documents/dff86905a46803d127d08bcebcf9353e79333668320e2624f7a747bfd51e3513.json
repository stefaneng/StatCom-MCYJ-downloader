    "FOM 802, pg 1 Mental Health Screening within 30 days\nOne of eight ASQs/PSCs was not completed within 30 days of\nentering care/transfer of case or at least once yearly thereafter\n(repeat policy noncompliance from 2019)\nFOM 722-08C Required participation -\nCaregivers and youth 14+ are to participate in the\ndevelopment of treatment plans\n3 of 29 PATPs were not signed by the caregiver or 14+ youth.\nOne was not signed by the caregiver.

CONSULTATION\nI held a two-hour training via Teams with licensing workers and the licensing\nSupervisor discussing COVID work arounds, the SER analysis section, the order\nof special evaluation interviews, double-citing and improving the quality of corrective\naction plans.\nDuring COVID restrictions and/or presumed positive cases in a foster home, all\nefforts should be made to conduct at least one virtual visit inside of the home for\nreevaluations.\nSupporting documents for reevaluations should be printed, placed in the foster home\nfile and uploaded to MiSACWIS. Sensitive client information should not be\nmaintained on personal devices and should be deleted as soon the information is\nprinted or backed up on a work device.\n5",
    "The follow-up referral section at the bottom of the ASQ should be finished by the\nworker and not left blank.\nAll documents should be checked to verify they are completed before uploading\nto MiSACWIS. Unfinished and unsigned documents should not be uploaded.\nV. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no safety alerts or foster home concerns identified by the DCWL\nAnalyst John Joubert.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated child abuse or neglect during this\nlicensing period. In both cases, the children were removed from the homes and\nthe agency recommended the foster home licenses be revoked.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period. It was determined the foster father swung at a child in his care.\nThe corrective action plan included the foster father completing behavior\nmanagement training before any more children were referred to his home.\nThe agency had no DCWL investigation and thus were not required to submit any\ncorrective action plans during this licensing period.\nDuring this Renewal inspection there was only one repeat policy noncompliance\nfrom the last inspection. The agency submitted acceptable corrective action\nplans for citations in December 2019:\nR 400.12418 (2) (a) Development of service plans\nR 400.12509 (3) (a – i) Independent living record\nFOM 802 Mental Health Screening within 30 days (repeat from 12/2019)\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MSA requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n6",
