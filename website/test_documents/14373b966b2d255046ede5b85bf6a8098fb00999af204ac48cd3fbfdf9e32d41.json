Youth A reported today on June\n6th, 2023, that \"Staff 1 choked me and dragged me across the\nroom\". Youth A reported that he had a bruise on the right side of\nhis neck. Youth A was observed today with no bruise. Staff 1 did\nan incident report on the incident.\nInvestigation Administrator 1/Complainant was interviewed face-to-face at\nthe facility, on 6/8/2023. He had no further information to provide\nbut reported Youth A is still lodged in the facility and is being kept\naway from the youth he assaulted.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\n6/8/2023. He reported hitting another youth before Staff 1 pushed\nhim off the other youth. Staff 1 jumped on top of him pushing him\nto the floor. Staff 1 is reported to have placed her arm around his\nneck and drag him for approximately 8 to 10 feet across the floor.\nHe reported she was the only staff present and never said\nanything to him while taking these actions. Other staff showed up\napproximately 15 seconds later and Staff 1 still had her arm\naround his neck. When the other staff tried to get him in his room,\nStaff 1 released him, and the other staff started telling him to calm\n2",
    "down. He denied resisting the restraint until they started putting\nhim into his room. Once in his room doorway, Youth A reported he\njust went into his room. He denied saying anything to staff during\nthe incident. He reported he feels safe in the facility and that staff\nare always observing the youth. He reported being “treated alright”\nin the facility.\nYouth B was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. Youth B was in the pod\nand reported asking Youth A if he was “good” to which Youth A\ntold him to “shut up”. Youth A was sitting on a chair across the\nroom from Youth A when Youth A got up, walked towards Youth\nB, took his shirt off, and began to punch Youth B. Youth B put his\nhands above his head to protect himself before heading to his\nroom. He was again attacked by Youth A before dropping to the\nfloor and waiting for staff to open his room door. He observed\nStaff 1 pinning Youth A to the ground. He reported hearing Youth\nA say staff grabbed him by the neck. Youth B reported being\nexamined by the nurse following the incident. Youth B reported\nnot feeling safe at the facility because other youth are targeting\nhim, and he doesn’t believe staff are doing anything to stop this\ntargeting. He described the targeting when he hears another youth\npoint at his room and say, “let me know when you want me to\ngreenlight it”.\nYouth C was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported being present\nduring the altercation between Youth A and Youth B. He reported\nYouth A was mad at Youth B because Youth A claimed Youth B\nhit him twice during a basketball game two days prior. He\ndescribed the incident. Youth A took off his shirt and began to hit\nYouth B. Youth A had been acting “weird” by all his pacing while in\nthe pod. Staff 1 tried to restrain Youth A after he hit Youth B and it\ndidn’t seem like she was successful. Staff 1 tackled Youth A after\nrunning him down. She had her arms around him (standing at the\ntime), and Youth A fell over as she grabbed him. Staff 1 had one\narm under Youth A’s arm pit and one over his other shoulder with\nher hand on his chest. He was unable to recall anything else since\nhe went to his room. Youth C feels safe at the facility and believes\nstaff are doing their jobs well.\nYouth D was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported being in the\npod at the time and gave the following information. Youth A took\noff his shirt and fought Youth B. Prior to this Youth A was walking\naround the pod. Staff 1 grabbed Youth A to keep him from\n3",
    "fighting. Staff 1 was on the ground and Youth A fell to the ground,\nbut “I didn’t see how it happened”. Staff 1 was on her hands and\nknees. Youth D was in his room and had a limited view of the\nincident. He reported Youth A claimed staff grabbed him by his\nneck. Youth D reported feeling safe at the facility and all of the\nrestraints he has observed appear appropriate.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported Youth A was\npacing around the pod and she told him to stop. Youth A then sat\ndown and he responded with “yo bro stop talking to me”. After\nsitting down for a moment, Youth A said he was going to get some\nwater. He then took off his shirt and began attacking Youth B.\nStaff 1 observed Youth A landing two to three hits on Youth B.\nShe had to call for help before assisting Youth B. Staff 1\nrequested a “lockdown” then grabbed Youth A and “tried to drag\nhim to his room”. She grabbed Youth A by his waist and one of his\narms at first. She did not recall having one of her arms around his\nneck nor being on the floor, but she believed Youth A was on the\nfloor at some point. After viewing the video recording, Staff 1\nasked why other staff in the room did not intervene and help her.\nShe reported it is hard to perform CPI when your only one person.\nShe believed the other staff in the room should have become\ninvolved by taking Youth A’s other arm. She reported not trying to\nget near Youth A’s neck, but he was resisting her during the\nrestraint. After she dragged him to the other side of the pod, Staff\n3 became engaged and held Youth A against the wall. She\nrecalled being asked to leave the area at this time by Supervisor.\nShe reported this was her first restraint although she had witness\nother restraints. She was aware of the other youth teasing Youth\nB because “he put his personal business out there by telling the\nother youth he had performed oral sex on an older male for money\nand alcohol”.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported receiving a call\nfor help and leaving his pod to assist. When he arrived, Youth A\nwas already in his room and two staff were standing near him in\nthe room. He reported speaking to Youth A four to five days later\nand Youth A told him Youth B elbowed him in the mouth playing\nbasketball and hit in him the mouth with his shoulder the day after.\nYouth A informed him he was ignoring Youth B until Youth B\ncalled him a “crackhead” in line earlier in the day of the incident.\nHe had no firsthand information on the restraint but did report\nknowing of the term “greenlighting’, and suggested it means\nsomeone is going to be the target of attack at any time. He\n4",
    "reported understanding Youth B has shared things about himself\nthat will cause him to be picked on. Staff do their best to protect\nYouth B by paying attention to other youth around him. These\nissues are sexual in nature. Staff 2 reported there was an informal\ndebriefing after the incident, and he learned very little about the\nincident other than Staff 1 got hurt during the restraint. He\nreported CPI is “team based” and should not be conducted by one\nperson.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported observing Youth\nA attacking Youth B from another pod and quickly went to the\nlocation of the fight. He observed Staff 1 falling on top of Youth A\nbut believed it was an accident. Youth A was laying on his side\nand she was over him. He believed Youth A slipped trying to get\nto Youth B again but not sure of this assessment. Staff 3 reported\nstopping when he entered the room because he wanted to assess\nthe situation before engaging. His rational for not engaging when\nfirst observing the situation was because he “needed to think\nbefore reacting because something could go wrong”. He reported\nStaff 1 then grabbed Youth A to stop him from getting to Youth B\nand she had her right arm around his right shoulder. She was not\nchoking him but as they moved across the room her left arm\nmoved up his chest and her arm contacted Youth A’s neck. Staff 3\ndid not believe Staff 1 was “dragging him to harm him” and Staff 1\nmade the “wrong move by dragging him”. He reported taking over\nwhen Staff 1 reached the other side of the pod with Staff 5, and\nStaff 4 assisting him. He reported other youth tease Youth B\nbecause of his personal life he shared with them, and staff are\nalways alert to interactions between Youth B and others. He\ndenied knowing what “greenlighting” means.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported receiving a\nradio call for help and went to pod D. When she reached the pod,\nshe observed Youth B standing in front of his door, so she let him\ninto his room. Staff 1 and Youth A were on the floor. Rather than\nengaging in the restraint right away, she “took a second to see\nwhat was going on”. Staff 4 didn’t see how Staff 1 moved Youth A\nto the far wall in the pod, but she remembers once there, she\ngrabbed one arm of Youth A and used the wall for support. She\ndidn’t want Youth A dropping to the floor because not only would\nYouth A go to the floor, but staff engaged would go to the floor.\nShe recalled Staff 3 was supporting Youth A from in front of him\nas they escorted him to his room. Staff 4 reported Staff 3, Staff 5\nand herself, who entered the pod should have reacted quicker and\n5",
    "not paused as they did. She knew that “greenlighting” means that\nsomeone is about to attack someone. She reported Youth B\nbrought the issue of Youth E saying greenlighting to staff attention\nbut is unsure if this was placed in the shift log. She reported both\nYouth E and Youth B were placed in their rooms for the\n“greenlighting incident”. She acknowledged staff are to pay close\nattention to Youth B because of other youth responding to some of\nhis behaviors.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported receiving a\nradio call for help. When entering the pod, she paused and\nscanned the room “for a second”. She felt timid because she just\ncame back to work a short time ago. She observed Staff 1 over\nYouth A and Youth A on his knees. Staff 1 had an arm over the\ntop of his shoulder and the other arm was higher up on the\nshoulder near the neck area. She didn’t see Staff 1’s arm choking\nYouth A and she didn’t see Staff 1 drag Youth A across the room.\nOnce she observed the video recording, she recalled the dragging\nactions and reported it never should have happened. She reported\nif a youth is on the floor, Staff should not have tried to move him\nand waited for help before attempting a restraint or to move him to\na standing position. There were enough staff present to do an\nappropriate restraint of Youth A. Staff 5 did engage in the restraint\nwhen Staff 3 and Staff 4 had him against the wall before escorting\nYouth A to his room. She had heard the term “greenlighting” a few\ntimes in the facility and knew of the incident between Youth E and\nYouth B. She reported Youth E was not upset when he said it and\nboth youths received a consequence for their inappropriate\ninteraction. She reported Youth B created the situation when he\n“talks about inappropriate things and then asks staff what they are\ngoing to do about it”.\nTrainer was interviewed via Video Conference, on 6/14/2023\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported having\nreviewed the video recording and being the primary CPI trainer for\nthe facility. He reported CPI doesn’t do a lot for engagement and\ngetting a hold on a youth is difficult. Initially staff does what they\nneed to do to get a hold on the youth but must be very careful\nbecause grabbing a youth can cause an injury. Trainer reported\nstaff should not engage without assistance. Observing the video\nrecording, Trainer had no issue with the initial hold by Staff 1\nwhen she had an arm over his shoulder and the other arm near\nhis chest. He reported Staff 1’s arm should not be near Youth A’s\nchest. He identified the first problem is other staff showing up and\nStaff 1 continued on her own without assistance. However, he\n6",
    "reported it is not wrong for the other staff to pause. He reported\nStaff 1 dragging Youth A across the room is not something that is\ntrained in CPI. Staff are not to carry a youth and if moving\nsomeone staff should encourage and “can use their hip to move\nthem forward”. He reported training staff to stop and step in if\nanother staff is doing something wrong and Staff 3 and Staff 4\nshould have moved into a CPI hold to move Youth A. He reported\nbecause of policy changes, all video recordings of restraints are\nreviewed.\nSupervisor was interviewed via Video Conference, on\n6/14/2023 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. He reported\nworking in “control” when the incident occurred. He heard the\nradio call and began opening youth’s room doors on the pod. This\nallowed the youth to go to their rooms as required during a\n“lockdown”. When he observed the pod over the video system, he\nnoticed Staff 3, Staff 4, and Staff 5 restraining Youth A against the\nwall and Youth A calmed down. He did not observe the restraint\nwhen Staff 1 was engaged with Youth A. He reported being aware\nof the tenson between Youth A and Youth B which spilled over\nfrom a basketball game in the gym a day before. He checked on\nboth Youth A and Youth B the next day to ensure they were doing\nwell medically. The only medical issue needs were Youth A’s\nswollen knuckles.\nStaff 6 was interviewed via phone, on 7/7/2023. She reported\nobserving Staff 1 having her arms wrapped about Youth A upon\nentering the pod. She doesn’t remember if she observed Staff 1\ndrag Youth A across the room. She did remember Staff 3, Staff 4,\nand Staff 5 engaging with Youth A against the far wall from the\nentrance door. She reported this was her first involvement in a\nrestraint since beginning her employment two months ago.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nCircuit court General Profile Report for Youth A.

The recording opens with a bird’s eye\nview of the pod where the incident took place. Youth A is sitting at\na table across the room by himself. Youth B is sitting at a table by\nhimself to the right of Staff 1 and across the room from Youth A.\nStaff 1 is sitting with her back to the wall and at a table with three\nyouth. To her left is another youth sitting at a table by himself. 20-\nseconds into the video, Youth A stands and begins to walk in the\ngeneral direction of Youth B. When getting close to Youth B,\nYouth A takes off his shirt, yells “bitch” and rushes to Youth B\nwhere he begins to punch him. Staff 1 stands and makes a radio\ncall before rushing after Youth A. During the time of Staff 1 making\nthe radio call, Youth B gets away from Youth A and begins to run\nacross the room. Youth A is closely following and punching at\nYouth B the whole time.
