    "The agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency renewal inspection was completed on 5/22/2024 and the CAP was\napproved on 7/2/2024. The agency was cited for 14 violations, 3 of which were\nrepeated this year. There was an improvement in individual incidents of non-\ncompliance within all 3 repeated violations. In 2023, 14 violations were\nestablished, 3 of which were repeated this year. Rule 400.12417 (1) (a-h) is\ncounted as 1 repeat. All of the repeated violations remain close to the same\nnumber of individual incidents of non-compliances. The agency will need to\nestablish additional corrective planning for the repeated violations to ensure a\nreduction of incidents.\nSpecial investigation 2025SIC0000167 was completed on 12/17/2024 and the\nCAP was approved on 2/3/2025. The agency was found in non-compliance as an\nagency foster care worker did not file a complaint with Centralized Intake after\nbecoming aware of suspected abuse or neglect. The agency's CAP included\nretraining staff and updating internal protocol to include requiring supervisor to\ndocument and note timeliness of receiving complaint email from Centralized\nIntake.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated the agency has struggled somewhat with staff turnover which has\nimpacted overall compliance. As a result of the previous year's CAP the agency\nhas implemented policy and rule refresher trainings that have been useful. The\nchief administrator indicated the agency has revised some processes such as\nadditional trainings and utilization of extended reach to ensure compliance moving\nforward.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThree staff were interviewed via telephone. Staff reported feeling supported by\ncoworkers and supervisors. There were no concerns reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.\n7",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two identified safety alerts.\nSafety Alert #1: The licensed foster home failed to respond to multiple attempts by\nAgency Analyst to schedule a home visit.\nResolution: A special evaluation was initiated by the agency on 4/10/2025. Licensed\nfoster parent was found to be in noncompliance with licensing rules. As a result, a\ncorrective action plan was required that is currently active. Since completion of the\nsafety alert the agency conducted a home visit on June 12, 2025. The social work\ncontact indicates a home assessment was completed and there were no safety\nconcerns.\nSafety Alert #2: Licensed foster home is missing smoke alarm outside of master\nbedroom and the rest of the home, outside of youth's bedrooms and the rest of the\nhome and missing in the basement. In addition, the hot tub does not have a locking\ncover or rescue equipment. There is also an unapproved room in the basement that\nis being used as a bedroom.\nResolution: Two special evaluations were initiated by the agency. The agency\nworked with licensed foster parent to purchase additional smoke alarms and move\nexisting smoke alarms in order to meet licensing requirements. The agency provided\npictures of installed smoke alarms in appropriate locations as verification. A locking\ncover and rescue ring were purchased for the hot tub. The hot tub was emptied until\nthose items were received and foster parent indicated she had no plans on using it\nin the near future. The agency provided a picture of the rescue ring and empty hot\ntub. Since completion of the safety alert the agency purchased a hot tub lock and\nprovided a picture of the locked hot tub as verification. In addition, an addendum\nwas written, signed and put in her file regarding the hot tub in her home. The agency\naddressed the unapproved room in the basement with licensed foster parent.\nScreenshot of the social work contact was provided by the agency. All concerns\naddressed in two special evaluations that resulted in corrective action plans which\nhave been completed.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n8",
