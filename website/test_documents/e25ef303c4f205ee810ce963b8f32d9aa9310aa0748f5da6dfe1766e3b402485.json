DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nSouth Bluff Teaching Family Home, 1005 Silver Creek Rd., Marquette, MI 49855 is a\nnew facility built as a residential treatment center. The construction was completed in\nSeptember 2009.\nSouth Bluff is located on a forty acre wooded area located in Sands Township at the\nend of Silver Creek Road; Teaching Family Homes of Upper Michigan officially acquired\nthe property in January 2003. The land contains an existing building and garage known\nas the Old Honor Camp, which was part of the state prison system. The Old Honor\nCamp building has been renovated to become the administrative offices, counseling\ncenter, classrooms, and a community family education and support center. South Bluff\nis the fourth resident treatment center constructed by Teaching Family Homes of Upper\nMichigan on this forty-acre campus.\nThe facility has two levels, which are approximately 2,600 square foot. South Bluff\nTeaching Family Home is handicap accessible. The facility has two wings intended for 4\nresidents on each wing with office, kitchen, open dining area, open living room area,\nand a television room with French doors in the center of the building.\nThe lower level has a recreation room area, which is about 869 square feet minus a\nstairway. There is a live-in family teacher’s apartment of about 1200 square feet that\nhas two bedrooms, kitchen/living room area and a full bath.\n2",
    "The facility has six resident bedrooms as follows:\nBedroom 1 (located at the northwest corner, intended for 2 residents) is 163.668 square\nfeet.\nBedroom 2 (located at the southwest corner, intended for 1 resident) is 86.650 square\nfeet.\nBedroom 3 (located next to Bedroom 2 toward the kitchen area, intended for 1 resident)\nis 87.009 square feet.\nBedroom 4 (located at the northeast corner, intended for 2 residents) is 158.413 square\nfeet.\nBedroom 5 (located at the southeast corner, intended for 1 resident) is 87.278 square\nfeet.\nBedroom 6 (located next to Bedroom 5 toward the kitchen area, intended for 1 resident)\nis 86.559 square feet.\nEach wing has a full bathroom and the lower level has a half bath off the recreation\narea.\nB. Program Description\nTeaching Family Homes of Upper Michigan currently has five Child Caring Institution\nactive licenses. A written request has been received to close CI210201411, also named\nSouth Bluff Teaching Family Home when the “new” South Bluff Teaching Family Home\nin licensed. The original South Bluff is located in Gladstone. The plan is to have the\ncurrent South Bluff residents move from Gladstone to Marquette when the new facility is\nlicensed.\nThis proposed Child Caring Institution will be an eight bed open residential treatment\nfacility (which is an increase from the six beds CI210201411 facility in Gladstone).\nThe program is based on the cognitive/behavioral principles and the Girls and Boys\nTown Psycho Educational Model.\nThe new South Bluff Teaching Family Home will continue to use the Gwinn Public\nSchools.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe facility has established compliance with all the licensing rules that can be measured\nbefore approval of a new license, and has established intent to comply with all licensing\nrules that can only be measured after the approval of a provisional license. “A” ratings\n3",
    "with no noncompliance are documented in the Fire Safety Inspection Report with the\ndate of inspection of 09/28/2009 and the Environmental Health Inspection Report, with\nthe date of inspection of 09/28/2009. Zoning Approval was received by Licensing in a\napproval form dated 02/20/2009 from the Zoning Administrator of Sands Township.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend issuance of an original provisional six-month license to this Child\nCaring Institution, Private.\n10/05/2009\n________________________________________\nDon Collier Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/05/09\n________________________________________\nDeborah Clark Date\nArea Manager\n4"
