    "5/19/2025 5:18 PM Email Special Investigation Initiation\nIII. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12214. Compliance with the child protection\nSection law.\nDescription (1) An agency shall comply with the child protection law, 1975 PA\n238, MCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency was informed during parenting time that the children\nare being maltreated in the foster home and the agency has not\nreported this.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 5/20/2025 I interviewed Parent C by telephone. Parent C\nreported her two children, Child A and Child B are placed with the\nagency, and she is concerned Foster Care Worker and agency\nare not doing anything about the concerns brought up to the\nagency about the children’s care and treatment. Parent C\nreported the children are being mistreated in their foster home\nplacement. She reported the children had reported only being fed\nonce a day, at night, because they eat two meals at school.\nAdditionally, Child B wets her bed and she and Child A have\nreported as punishment their windows are opened, and their\ncovers/sheets are taken. Parent C reported two weeks ago the\nchildren came to their visit with their father, Parent D, and they\nhad colds. Parent C wondered if the colds were due to the\nchildren’s windows being left open. Parent C further reported that\nthe foster parents talk negatively about the parents with the\nchildren, and Child B is bullied at school, was pushed down, with\nno one doing anything about it. Parent C reported these concerns\nwere mentioned to her by her husband, Parent D. Parent C\nreported Parent D has visitation rights with both children as\nopposed to her, but she sent an email to Foster Care Worker\n(FCW) and Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) about these concerns.\nParent C said she sent her first email to FCW and FCS on\n4/1/2025; and that email was about the children sharing with\nParent D that the foster parents were talking negatively about\nthem as parents. Parent C said neither FCW nor FCS responded\nto her email. Parent C reported sending another email to FCW\nand FCS on 4/8/2025; and she included Program Manager on that\nemail. She said she also tried to forward her 4/1/2025 email to\nProgram Manager but was unable to do so until later. Parent C\nreported her 4/8/2025 email was about the children reporting they\nwere only being fed one meal a day due to eating two meals at\n2",
    "school, and the windows being opened to air out the room,\nbecause Child B was having bed wetting accidents. Parent C said\nProgram Manager responded to her on 4/10/2025 that Program\nManager will look into the concerns. Parent C said she has not\nheard anything further from Program Manager or the agency\nabout her and Parent D’s concerns about the children’s\nmistreatment in foster care.\nOn 5/21/2025 I spoke with the Chief Administrator (CA) about\nthis complaint by telephone. CA reported when the children’s\nparents brought up the concerns the agency immediately made a\nchildren services referral. CA reported the agency investigated\nthe concerns. CA reported FCS and FCW would have more\ndetails about this situation and that those staff can be contacted.\nOn 5/28/2025 I spoke with Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) about\nthe allegations via TEAMS. FCS reported FCW made a children\nservices referral about these concerns in April 2025. He reported\nthe agency was advised of the allegations on 4/30/2025 during\nParent D’s parenting time. He reported the information was\nreceived directly by FCW who called him, and he advised her to\ncontact children services, which FCW did. FCS reported the\nchildren are placed in a licensed foster home and to his\nknowledge, licensing was initiating a special evaluation about the\nallegations.\nFCS reported Parent C was not visiting with the children, but\nParent D was, and initially Parent D was not engaging with staff.\nHe reported Parent C’s rights are terminated to all the children\nexcept Child B. He reported discussing all things with Parent C\nwas not appropriate in the past due to her parental rights being\nterminated, but it is now appropriate to discuss Child B with Parent\nC. He denied Parent C emailing him on 4/1/2025. He said Parent\nC emailed him on 4/22/2025, and 5/1/2025 but neither of those\nemails were about these allegations. He reported Parent C also\nemailed him on 5/8/2025, and that email was about these\nconcerns; and he responded and suggested Parent C to call him\nand FCW. He said he set up a TEAMs meeting which was held on\n5/20/2025. FCS reported at the 5/20/2025 meeting the agency\nshared with Parent C that since her rights were terminated to all\nthe children except Child B, they could not discuss the other\nchildren, but they discussed action plans taken related to Child B.\nFCS reiterated a children service referral was in fact submitted\nrelated to the allegations prior to 5/1/2025. He emailed me a copy\nof the DHS-3200(Report of Actual or Suspected Child Abuse or\nNeglect) and emails received from Parent C.\n3",
    "On 5/30/2025 I spoke with Program Manager (PM) related to the\nallegations by telephone. PM reported the allegations came to the\nagency’s attention prior to any email from Parent C and the\nagency completed a children services referral. She reported\nParent C has been emailing her every other day; and she has\nreplied to Parent C; as did FCS. She denied receiving an email\nfrom Parent C on 4/1/2025 or 4/8/2025. She said Parent C\nemailed her on 5/8/2025, stating the children are sick, the foster\nparent speak negatively about her and Parent D, Child A and\nChild B have colds and do not have enough covers for their beds,\nand the children get two meals at school and only one in the foster\nhome. PM said she replied to Parent C’s 5/8/2025 email on\n5/9/2025. PM said Parent C sent another email just to her on\n5/11/2025, which she forwarded to FCS and FCW because Parent\nC reported sending them to FCS and FCW, and them not\nresponding to it. PM said Parent C had advised there was an\nattachment in the email, but none was there; and PM advised\nParent C of that. PM reported the agency was following up on any\nrelatives Parent C provided; and the special evaluation on the\nfoster parents about the allegations is ongoing. PM reported the\nspecial evaluation was opened on 4/30/2025; and she became\naware of it on 5/1/2025. She said a home visit was made by FCW\nand two other workers related to the allegations.\nOn 6/3/2025, I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) by\ntelephone related to the allegations. FCW affirmed information as\nreported by FCS and PM. FCW reported assignment to Child A’s\nand Child B’s case since August 2024. She reported an\nawareness of bedwetting for Child B; because the foster parent\nhad reported Child B wets the bed one to three times per night.\nFCW reported both Child B and the foster parents have denied\nParent C’s allegation that sheets are taken from Child B at night\nwhen Child B wets herself. FCW reported the aforementioned was\nan allegation that came after parenting time on 5/8/2025, as the\nchild said goodbye to Parent D. FCW reported she followed up on\nthat allegation at a home visit on 5/9/2025 where it was denied.\nShe also spoke with the children and foster parents about the\nmeals allegations. The children all reported getting three meals a\nday during the week, which was that two of them are at school.\nThey reported during the weekend, they also get three meals a\nday, unless they sleep in, which they often do on Saturday; and\nwhen they do sleep in they get two meals. However, if they are\nhungry and ask for food it is available to them and provided.\nSnacks are also available to the children, if they ask, and FCW\n4",
    "reported she had advised the children to ask when they want\nsomething because the children were not doing that.\nDocument Review:\nChild A’s and Child B’s MISACWIS records which showed:\n• Both children are temporary court wards as of 8/2/2024 and\n3/20/2025 respectively.\n• They have five other older siblings in care.\n• They were placed in their current foster home placement\nwith Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 on 11/13/2024\nand 3/20/2025 respectively.\nCopies of emails from FCS that contained copies of:\n• A DHS-3200 dated 4/30/2025 which indicated Foster\nParent 1 threatened to beat Child A with a belt if Child A hit\nthe other foster child again; and that the foster parent\ndenied using physical discipline in the past. Additionally,\nFoster Parent 1 made the other foster child to sleep on the\nfloor due to the boys talking during bedtime.\n• An 4/22/2025 email from Parent C that appeared to\ncomplain to FCS about FCW; indicating FCW does not\nunderstand her; started out on the wrong foot with her\nwhen FCW first got the case.\n• A 5/1/2025 email from Parent C to FCS, FCW, and Parent\nD where Parent C indicated she would not have paid\nstrangers speaking negatively about her and Parent D. If\nthis matter is not addressed right away, she will start\nmaking complaints to people about the recipients’ pay\ngrade; and if the recipients retaliate it will be reported.\n• A 5/8/2025 email from Parent C to FCS, FCW and PM\nwhere Parent C indicated the children being sick, allegedly\ndue to the windows being left open and sheets taken as\npunishment, as well as Child B having accidents; Child B\nbeing bullied at school, pushed down; and the children not\neating enough, due to only getting one meal in the foster\nhome because they eat breakfast and lunch at school; and\nthat the foster parents are speaking negatively about them\nas birth parents.

The\ncomplaint was initiated on 5/1/2025 for allegations of\nphysical discipline of the children; and making a child sleep\n5",
    "on the floor. The investigation concluded with no evidence\nthat the foster parents used or threatened to use physical\ndiscipline with Child A, Child B or the other child in the\nhome or an inappropriate action by the foster parents. All\nthree children denied such actions occurring and reported\nfeeling safe in the home, having enough food and enough\nclothing.\n• Special evaluation 2025SEC0000738 dated 7/8/2025. The\ncomplaint was initiated on 6/8/2025. The complaint related\nto allegations that these foster parents were not ensuring\nfor services for the children and are speaking negatively to\nthe foster children about their birth parents. No rule\nviolations were substantiated related to these allegations.\n• These special evaluations addressed some concerns noted\nby Parent C, related to maltreatment; and FCW addressed\nsome concerns during a home visit with the foster parents\nand children on 5/8/2025 and 5/9/2025.\nAnalysis The evidence does not support a lack of failure to report. It\nshowed the agency made a referral to children services related to\nallegations of possible maltreatment in the foster home and the\nagency initiated a special evaluation on the foster home.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & R400.12327 Special evaluation.\nSection (1) Upon receipt of any information that is related to a\nDescription possible noncompliance with any foster home rule, the\nagency must do all of the following:\n(b) Initiate Special evaluation of the foster home as soon as is\nindicated, based on the information received, but not later\nthan 7 calendar days after receipt of the information.\nViolation Additional Finding.\nType\nAllegation All of the allegations that were alleged by the birth parent were not\ninvestigated in the agency’s special evaluation.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Chief Administrator, Foster Supervisor, Program\nManager about the allegation on 5/21/2025, 5/28/2025 and\n5/30/2025 respectively either by telephone or TEAMs. All\nreported concerns and allegations expressed by Parent C were\naddressed by the agency.
