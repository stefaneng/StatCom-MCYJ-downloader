The agency was cited for 7 violations, 6 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 6, there was an improvement in individual incidents of\nnon-compliance within 1 of the violation areas, a slight increase in number of\nindividual incidents in 3 areas and 2 areas remained the same. In 2023, 8\nviolations were established, 4 of which were repeated this year. All of the repeated\nviolations remain close to the same number of individual incidents of non-\ncompliances. The agency will need to establish additional corrective planning for\nthe repeated violations to ensure a reduction of incidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated the previous year’s CAP has been somewhat effective. Citations related\nto personnel files were addressed by adding a reminder in the onboarding\nchecklist. The KPI's have been more difficult to address due to ongoing issues\nwith turnover at the partner agencies.\nThe chief administrator indicated turnover at the agencies has been a primary\nbarrier, especially at the worker and supervisor level. However, workforce\ndevelopment grants issues by WMPC did show some positive impact on turnover.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff, one via telephone and one via video\nconference. Staff reported feeling supported by the agency. Supervisors and\ncoworkers are available as needed to assist. Staff did not report any concerns\nrelated to the agency.\n5",

RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n___________5/1/2025___________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 2, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
