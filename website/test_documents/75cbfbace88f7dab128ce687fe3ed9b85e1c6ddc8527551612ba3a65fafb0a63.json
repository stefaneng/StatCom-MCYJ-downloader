Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nFacility has not submitted records to MDHHS for permanent retention one year\nfollowing the final order of adoption as required.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/23/2022 I was assigned to investigate an allegation submitted through the on-\nline reporting system that the agency did not distribute closed adoption files to the\nlocal offices timely. The allegation named 7 specific files: Youth A, Youth B, Youth C,\nYouth D, Youth E, Youth F, and Youth G.\nInterviews\nOn 5/26/2022 I conducted an on-site visit and interviewed the agency’s Director.\nDirector reported that the Administrative Assistant responsible for tracking the closed\nadoption file dissemination to local offices was out of the office but would be\navailable for interview upon return. He stated that there have been times when that\nstaff has attempted to bring closed adoption files to local offices as well as directly to\nMDHHS Document Control in Lansing, but the files would not be accepted due to\nthere being insufficient storage space in those offices.\nOn 6/1/2022 I interviewed Administrative Assistant via telephone. She reported that\nshe didn’t know there was a timeframe of delivering files to local offices within 1\n2",
    "month of the year anniversary of finalization. She also stated that the files of Youth\nA, B, and C were filed by another support staff in a file cabinet separate from the\nother cases finalized in 2020, unbeknownst to Administrative Assistant, which led to\nthe delay in those files being distributed to the applicable local office. Administrative\nAssistant stated that she has already begun the process of tracking finalization dates\nto ensure that the cases are distributed to the applicable local office within the 13-\nmonth timeframe rather than the previous practice of distributing the files based\nsolely on the year the case was finalized. Administrative Assistant added that this\nwill also change how the files will be transferred to the local offices as the current\npractice is to physically deliver them, but they will have to look at mailing files more\nfrequently than they have in the past to ensure they can meet the 13-month\ndeadline.\nDocument Review\nOn 5/24/2022 I received a forwarded email from Complainant with the following\ninformation regarding the cases named in the allegation:\n Youth A, Adoption Date 11/18/2020\n Youth B, Adoption Date 11/19/2020\n Youth C, Adoption Date 11/19/2020\n Youth D, Adoption Date 11/24/2020\n Youth E, Adoption Date 11/24/2020\n Youth F, Adoption Date 11/24/2020\n Youth G, Adoption Date 2020\nOn 5/24/2022 I received and reviewed an email from Director including the following\ninformation regarding the cases named in the allegation:\n Youth A, File dropped off at Allegan DHHS 5/17/2022\n Youth B, File dropped off at Allegan DHHS 5/17/2022\n Youth C, File dropped off at Allegan DHHS 5/17/2022\n Youth D, File dropped off at Ottawa DHHS on 5/17/2022\n Youth E, File mailed to Wayne DHHS on 4/26/2022\n Youth F, File mailed to Wayne DHHS on 4/26/2022\n Youth G, File mailed to Wayne DHHS on 4/26/2022\nOn 5/26/2022, while on-site, Director showed me the locked storage of all adoption\nfiles in files cabinets which were all labelled by year.\nOn 5/27/2022 I received and reviewed a corrective action plan from Director\ndocumenting steps to be taken to ensure timely delivery of closed adoption files to\nlocal offices.\nOn 6/7/2022 I received and reviewed an email from Administrative Assistant which\nincluded an attached list of all adoptions finalized by the agency beginning October\n3",
    "2020. This list included the date the files were distributed to the applicable local\noffice as follows:\n Youth H Finalized 10/5/20, Distributed 4/12/22\n Youth I Finalized 11/24/20, Distributed 4/12/22\n Youth J Finalized 12/17/20, Distributed 1/24/22\n Youth K Finalized 12/20/20, Distributed 5/17/22\n Youth L Finalized 1/7/21, Distributed 1/24/22\n Youth M Finalized 1/27/21, Distributed 3/1/22\n Youth N Finalized 2/2/21, Distributed 4/5/22\n Youth O Finalized 2/2/21, Distributed 4/5/22\n Youth P Finalized 2/11/21, Distributed 3/15/22\n Youth Q Finalized 2/11/21, Distributed 3/15/22\n Youth R Finalized 3/5/21, Distributed 4/5/22\n Youth S Finalized 3/5/21, Distributed 4/5/22\n Youth T Finalized 3/15/21, No distribution date provided\n Youth U Finalized 3/24/21, Distributed 3/1/22\n Youth V Finalized 3/25/21, Distributed 5/17/22\n Youth W Finalized 3/31/21, Distributed 5/17/22\n Youth X Finalized 4/8/21, Distributed 3/25/22\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nADM 1030 Disposition of Records for MDHHS Supervised Children\nFor both MDHHS and contracted adoption agency cases, the\nlocal MDHHS office or contracted agency must retain all\nadoption case records for one year after finalization of the\nadoption. One year (between 12-13 months) past the adoption\nfinalization date, a contracted adoption agency must send the\noriginal record to the local MDHHS office; copies must not be\nmaintained by the contracted adoption agency; see licensing\nrule R400.12713-Adoption Placement Record.\nANALYSIS: The agency is found in non-compliance as the files named in the\ncomplaint as well as additional files reviewed were not\ndistributed to the local offices within the timeframe.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n4",
