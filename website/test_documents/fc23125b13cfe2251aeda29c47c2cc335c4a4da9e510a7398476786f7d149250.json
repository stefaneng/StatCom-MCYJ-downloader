    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.10103 Program statement.\n(1) A facility shall have a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Written policies and procedures pertaining to the\nadmission, care, and release of residents.\nI reviewed 12 incident reports. The incident reports did not\ncontain the needed information outlined in their “Written\nDocumentation” policy. The incidents resulted in the usage of\nthe seclusion room. Because the incident reports were vague, it\nappeared the staff were using seclusion as a “first response” to\nbehavioral issues ranging from disrespect to aggressive\nbehavior. After interviews, it was clear the staff are using their\nde-escalation techniques outlined in their behavior management\nplan, they are just not documenting this information. One of the\nincident reports resulted in a restraint. As written, the agency\nwould be in violation of using an improper restraint. After\ndiscussions, it was once again perceived that the staff and\nsupervisor did not include all of the information required in their\nincident report policy to outline the events leading up to the\nrestraint.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nR 400.10103: Incident report writing\nR 400.10208: Preliminary resident plan: Specific needs has been added to the\nreport. A child had a specific medical need (insulin shots and monitoring). The\nagency has a good process to ensure that all staff are aware of the needs. This\ninformation is kept in a medical record and dispersed from the nurse to the\nsupervisors to the staff. Through interviews it was clear that the process works\nwell. Although they have a different system to outline medical needs (in the\n4",
    "medical files) It was discussed to add those medical needs to the Preliminary\nresident report under “residents immediate and specific needs”.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas: CAP writing.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nInterim CAP 2021: The agency was cited during the 2020 interim for failure to\nhave all the required parts to their preliminary assessment. The required parts\nwere added as observed by this consultant during this renewal evaluation.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MSA requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n7/19/22\n________________________________________\nVenus M.
