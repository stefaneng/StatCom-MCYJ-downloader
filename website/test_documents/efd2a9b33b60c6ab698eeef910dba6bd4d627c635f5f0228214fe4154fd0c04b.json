Youth A\ninformed Staff 4, that Youth A is struggling with a prior rape,\nmother’s death, and absence father. Youth A informed Staff 4 of\nthese issues the day before Youth A’s attempt.

Supervisor 1 left the\nbathroom and asked if any staff could perform CPR and Staff 7\nreported he knew the procedure. Supervisor 1 called 911 at this\ntime. Supervisor 1 thought Youth A was dead, but Staff 7 found a\npulse and began CPR once Youth A was taken off the toilet. At\nfirst staff didn’t observe the shoestring around Youth A’s neck\nbecause Youth A’s neck was swollen but once on the floor\nSupervisor 1 noticed the shoestring and began yelling for scissors\nto be brought to the bathroom. Once scissors were brought\nSupervisor 1 cut the shoestring. Supervisor 1 didn’t recall the level\nof observation Youth A was on at the time but believed it may\nhave been for self-harm.

Supervisor 1 was interviewed again via phone on\n5/9/2024. She believed Staff 5 had the responsibility of the wing\n(youth) that Youth A was on but was not 100% sure. She reported\nbeing mandated to work the second shift because of a lack of\nstaff. She reported staff working on that wing should have been\naware of the safety plan for Youth A.

Supervisor 1\nreported telling Youth B that Youth B should have informed staff\nabout Youth A wanted to self-harm and later apologized for saying\nthis. Supervisor 1 reported Youth D may have been present when\nSupervisor 1 said this to Youth B.
