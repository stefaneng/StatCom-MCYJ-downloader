In this example the\ndocumentation indicates the foster parents received the application 04/27/2020 and\nthe license had an expiration date of 05/18/2020.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the\nreevaluation. The placement specifications shall include all\nof the following:\n(a) Age,\n(b) Gender,\n(c) Race,\n(d) Number of children preferred by the family,\n(e) Characteristics of children best served by the home,\n(f) Children who may not be placed in the home. The\nchild's racial, ethnic, and cultural identity, heritage, and\nbackground may only be considered if an assessment of\nthe individual child indicates that such consideration is in\nthe best interests of the child.\nTwo of the three current foster home files reviewed did not have all the information in\nthe recommendations as required by this rule. In the first example the\ncorresponding 3706 indicated an acceptable gender of male or female, but an\nacceptable gender was not identified in the recommendations in a report dated\n05/17/2020. In the second example the 3706 identified a capacity of 3 and age\nrange of 8-16 years and the corresponding report recommendations did not identify\na capacity and the age range was for 10-18 years.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(8) An agency shall complete a reevaluation and shall make a\nlicensing recommendation to the department at least 15\ncalendar days before the expiration date of the foster home\nlicense.\n4",
