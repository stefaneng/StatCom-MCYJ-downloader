INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Financial stability.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12203\nSection (1) An agency shall demonstrate sufficient financing, on an ongoing\nDescription basis, to ensure the agency is carrying out its programs and meeting\nthe requirements for licensing. A plan of financing must include all\nthe following:\n(a) A listing of all income sources and the anticipated amount of\nincome for the current fiscal year.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There is a concern with the agency's finances.\nInvestigation Complaint document review and Interviews:\nOn 12/2/2024 this complaint was assigned to me, and I reviewed the\ncomplaint by way of a Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices (MDHHS) Compliance Monitoring Memo. The memo dated\n11/22/2024 indicated the agency’s audit report for the fiscal year that\nended 12/31/2023 had information within it that should be brought to\nthe DCWL’s (Division of Child Welfare Licensing) attention. The\nmemo noted sections from the agency’s independent audit as\noutlined below:\nDecline in Total Net Assets\nNet assets indicate the extent to which revenues exceed expenses\nand is an indicator of the financial health of an organization.\n• The Agency has an increase in net assets of 0.14%, a positive\n$1,580. A total net deficit of $1,431,307. Prior year net assets\nas adjusted declined $1,432,493.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is a common measure of an agency’s liquidity.\nNegative working capital generally indicates an agency’s inability to\npay off its short-term liabilities if they came due immediately.\n2",
    "• The agency’s working capital is a negative $75,980\n• Prior year working capital was a negative $346,258.\nCurrent Ratio\nCurrent ratio tests liquidity by deriving the proportion of current\nassets available to cover current liabilities. The higher the current\nratio, the more capable the agency is of paying its obligations. A ratio\nunder 1 suggests that the agency could be unable to pay off its\nobligations if they came due at that point.\n• The agency’s current ratio is 0.55:1\nLimited Cash\nThis area noted:\n• Although the Agency has historically operated with a high\ncash balance, the agency currently has no cash balance.\n• The lack of cash or cash equivalents suggests the agency\ncould be unable to meet current day-to-day needs.\n• Long-term liabilities now, and referenced notes payable to\nMDHHS for $265,013, U.S. Small Business Administration\n(SBA) for $145,163 and Payroll taxes due the IRS for\n$951,607. A total of $1,361,783.\n• Going Concerns Issue Arising from Deficit in Net Assets:\n➢ In the memo it indicated the agency has a deficit in net\nassets in the amount of $1,431,307. Its current\nliabilities exceed its current assets in the amount of\n$87,016(Accounts Receivable, $82,522 minus current\nliabilities, $169,538 = $87,016), as of December 31,\n2023.\n➢ The organization had a deficit in net assets in the\namount of $1,431,307 as of 12/31/2023. That its\ncurrent liabilities exceeded its current assets in the\namount of $87,010 as of 12/31/2023. These factors\nraise substantial doubt about the organization’s ability\nto continue as a going concern. The agency will\nincrease its revenue by providing additional services to\nMDHHS; and management believes these factors will\ncontribute towards maintaining profitability.\n• Availability and Liquidity-\n➢ The availability funds are all Accounts receivable,\n$82,522. The Agency has no cash. At December\n31,2023, the monthly operating expenses were\n$94,657.\n➢ Homes for Black Children’s (HBC) financial assets as\nof 12/31/2023 was $82,522. The agency’s monthly\noperating expenses were $94,657 and at the end of\n3",
    "12/31/2023 the agency had $82,522 available to meet\nexpenditures in year ended 12/31/2024.\nInterviews:\nSenior Auditor:\nOn 1/13/2025 via email, I inquired of Senior Auditor of the\nCompliance Monitoring Unit where the $265,013.00 mentioned in the\nMemo as an amount reportedly owed by the agency to MDHHS\noriginated from. He indicated it was mentioned in the report for\nFY2022, Note E. The overpayments mentioned in the FY2022 report\nwere new to him and this could have been from a review beyond his\nscope. He indicated his department files do not have the information\nregarding that amount.\nChief Administrator:\nI spoke with and interviewed Chief Administrator (CA) about the\nallegation by telephone on 12/2/2024; onsite on 12/5/2024,\n12/19/2024 and 1/9/2025. I also received email statements and or\ndocumentation from her or the agency on 12/5/2024,1/13/2025 and\n1/14/2025.\nCA reported she could understand the department having a concern\nthat the agency’s 2023 financial audit showed the agency having a\nno cash balance/no accessible funds available, at that time. She\nreported that is not their current situation. She reported as of\n12/5/2024 the agency has a cash balance of $141, 800. 87, which is\nvia First Independent Bank. She reported that after the agency was\nplaced on the first provisional license the agency went six months\nwithout an intake which amounted to a $150,000 loss for the agency.\nAdditionally, childcare payments of $46,949.62 that was due to the\nagency from the department on December 28, 2023, had not been\nreceived until January 2, 2024. This contributed to the 2023 financial\naudit showing no cash balance for the agency at that time.\nCA reported the agency being in a better financial position than it\nwas at the end of the financial audit in 2022 with respect to the\nagency having a deficit of $85,016. She reported the agency did not\nhave a deficit in 2023 but had a $ 1,580 net asset. She expressed\nconcern about the toll and negative impact this matter has on staff\nmorale and reported the last special investigation outcome brought\nabout a loss of some long-term foster parents. She stated the\nagency has done everything that was required of it, inclusive of hiring\na different financial auditor and creating a specialty committee. She\nbelieves the agency has made progress since 2022 and 2023. She\nreported the 2024 independent financial audit, which will not come\n4",
    "out until after September of 2025, will show the agency gaining\ngreater financial standing.\nCA reported during the agency’s exit conference related to its last\nrenewal inspection, where the second provisional license was\nrecommended and subsequently issued, the agency’s\ndeficits/financial matters were not ones that would be eliminated in\nsix months. She hopes the department will take into account the\nefforts they are making, the fact they continue to provide needed\nservices to children, and that they are increasing their number of\nchildren served. Therein, creating additional revenue to continue\npaying their debtors timely. She reported the agency currently\nreceives funding of approximately $46,000 bi-weekly for 38 children;\nin addition to adoption income (which was $67, 750 in the prior fiscal\nyear). She reported these funding sources are indicated in the\nindependent financial audit.\nShe reported the agency is current with its foster care payments to\ncaregivers, its lease, utilities, IRS tax payments, over payments\nowed the state, which they have confirmed, and other agency\nfinancial obligations. She reported with respect to the old reported\nhigh amount owed MDHHS (Michigan Department of Health and\nHuman Services), the agency attempted to verify any amounts owed\nto the State for resolution over the past couple of years and they\naddressed it in their past renewal corrective action plan related to\nfinancial instability. She reported Financial Clerk also made recent\nattempts to verify any amounts owed to the State. She reported with\nrespect to the SBA loan, the original amount of the loan was\n$150,000, and as of August 7, 2024, the balance was $140,204. She\nreported payments for this loan had been deferred by SBA; and they\nresumed in May 2024. She reported the agency pays $641.00\nmonthly on this debt. The agency made a double payment in July\n2025, for the June and July 2025 payment.\nFinancial Clerk:\nOn 12/19/2024, I interviewed Financial Clerk onsite. She reported\nher role is to ensure payrolls are dispensed and the agency bills are\npaid. She reported there have been no late payments to foster\nparents, relative caregivers, staff or other entities or debtors.\nShe reported making inquiries, mostly via telephone and some faxes,\nto the State in an attempt to find out what, if any monies the agency\nmay owe MDHHS. These inquiries were from June 2024 through\nAugust 2024, and mostly with the Bureau of Finance and\nAccounting. She reported not having a specific MDHHS staff\nperson’s name. She reported the parties she had contact with\n5",
    "ultimately indicated via a letter dated 10/10/2024 that the agency\nonly owed $742.31, for a past over payment; and HBC made that\npayment to MDHHS in October 2024.\nAgency Employees\nOn 12/20/2024 I interviewed five staff members (Staff 1-Staff 5)\nonsite about this complaint. Staff 1 worked for the agency, 11 years\non and off, Staff 2 three months, Staff 3 one year, Staff 4 and Staff 5\nalmost six years respectively.\nAll five employees reported being paid by the agency via check\nevery two weeks. These employees did not report concerns with not\nbeing paid timely; nor did they have a missed or bounced paycheck.\nNone of the staff were aware of caregivers not being paid or not\nbeing paid timely. Staff 5 reported the agency has not had any recent\nproblem in this area. She said the only issues that come into play at\ntimes relates to DOCs (Difficulties of care) payment issues and CA\nhas worked with those families to give them advance payments while\nall is worked out with the department. She reported feeling the\nagency is in a good financial area.\nFoster Parents/Caregivers:\nDuring this special investigation I interviewed four foster parents and\nfour unlicensed relative caregivers either on 1/10/2025 or 1/13/2024.\n• Of the eight caregivers (Caregiver A through Caregiver H)\ninterviewed, all reported being paid timely during the time they\nhave been licensed and or connected to the agency, which\nranged from under one year to three to four years. All with the\nexception of one foster parent, who had not fostered in about\na year, had a child or children placed in their care by way of\nthe agency. All reported payment for the foster child’s care is\nor was by way of a monthly check. None of these caregivers\nreported any missed or bounced foster care payments. All\neight of the caregivers reported the agency works well with\nthem and they would recommend the agency to other\ncaregivers.\nDocument Review:\nThe financial Compliance Monitoring Memo as described and\nreferenced earlier in this report.\nThe agency’s prior 2022C0420008 special investigation report\nwhich showed debts and obligations as indicated during that\ninvestigation. Additionally, documents from the CA showed proof\nthat these debts and obligations have or are being paid:\n6",
    "The agency’s lease was made on 9/1/2021. The agency was to pay\nan annual lease payment in the sum of $71,280, that was payable\nmonthly in the amount of $5,940. The agency’s electricity, telephone,\nand gas were included in their lease payment. The agency showed\nproof that those payments were being made regularly.\n• The agency’s current lease is reported as $6,179.97 monthly.\nPayment invoices from 1/1/2024 through 12/1/2024 and\ncopies of checks for each month showed a payment of $\n6,179.97 monthly payment for rent to the agency’s current\nlandlord, P & A Development Group. Additionally, a\nstatement on P & A Development letterhead received on\n12/19/2024 indicated the agency’s rent is paid in full until\n1/1/2025.\nThe agency’s $150,000 Small Business Administration loan was\ngranted in 2020: with a thirty-year repayment in the amount of\n641.00 monthly beginning July 2022.\n• A copy of a transaction history from the First Independent\nBank showed a list of payments in the amount of $641.00 for\nSBA loan for May, August, October, November and December\nof 2024; and a $1300.00 payment in July 2024 for July and\nJune 2024. CA had reported the loan had been deferred until\nMay 2024. CA reported the September 2024 payment was\nmissed but was being paid with the agency’s January 2025’s\npayment.\nThe agency had an old IRS debt which at the time of the\n2022C0420008 special investigation was $957,571.66 for a tax\nmatter related to 6/2018, 9/2018, 12/2018, 3/2019 and 6/2019; as\nwell as a tax period in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The agency entered\ninto an installment agreement with the IRS in May 2023. The agency\nagreed to pay monthly installments of $2,000.00 initially, with that\nincreasing overtime to $3,300.00 monthly.\n• Statements received from the agency on 12/5/2024 of bank\naccount statements showed regular payments to the IRS in\nthe amount of $2,300.00 per month from October 2023\nthrough February 2024; and then $3,300 per month from\nFebruary 2024 to November 2024. The account statement\nshowed that as of 12/4/2024 the agency owes the IRS\n$147,607.16.\nHBC was reported to have an outstanding overpayment balance\nowed to MDHHS for 2014 and 2015. The amount of that debt was\noriginally not certain; and HBC questioned that debt. The agency’s\n2023 renewal inspection report mentioned the debt, but did not list\n7",
    "an amount. A figure of $211, 297.73 was later noted as the reported\nMDHHS debt. Then $265,013 was alleged in this complaint:\n• The agency believed it did not owe such that large debt\namount based on information reported below.\n• The agency indicated it addressed the matter of the large debt\nreportedly owed MDHHS back in 2022 and 2023 and it was\nnot clear as to whether these monies were owed.\n• HBC suggested back then that MDHHS had not provided\ntransparency in their accounting of the repayment amounts or\na current balance owed.\n• HBC also reasoned that since MDHHS did not make\ncollection attempt efforts during the past few years, MDHHS\nshould forgive any remaining debt owed.\n• HBC was to continue discussion with the Department\nregarding that matter; and reported setting aside $1000 per\nmonth to utilized, if the law required HBC to repay the debt.\nCopies of check request forms, and bank deposits of canceled\nchecks showed the agency has been depositing $1,000.00\nper month into an over payment/contingency fund account\nsince August 2024. This fund/this action step is one the\nagency put forth in its 2023 renewal inspection corrective\naction plan, which was ultimately approved on 8/21/2024. This\nfund was reportedly reserved for possible future obligations to\nthe state.\n• HBC was to continue to search out this matter to try to\nascertain whether HBC owed these monies and what actual\namount. The following was provided to show its contact\nefforts with MDHHS related to what if any monies are owed by\nHBC.\no A 4/26/2024 Collection-Notice-Foster Care Agency letter to\nHBC that indicated the department was pursuing\noverpayments that occurred since April 2014, and it was\ndiscovered in or after July 2016. The amount indicated in\nthis letter was $262.65. The letter asked HBC to make the\npayment.\no Copy of a cancelled check and payment recorded showed\n$262.65 was paid to the State on 5/14/2024.\no A 10/27/2024 “To Whom It May Concern” letter that was\nfrom Financial Clerk gave a recap of phone calls reportedly\nto the State, from 9/27/2024-10/28/2024. A phone number\nas to where the phone calls were made was not included\nin this letter. This letter and the subsequent letters below\nby Financial Clerk all relate to the agency’s effort to obtain\nproof from the Department related to what monies may be\nowed to the Department by HBC.\n8",
    "o Another letter from Financial Clerk, that was not dated,\nsimilar to the one noted above, to the State of Michigan\nnaming Financial Clerk and her attempts to contact\nsomeone on various dates. This letter indicated Financial\nClerk spoke with a gentleman on 8/29/2024 and the\nperson reporting the agency balance was $2477.95, that\nincluded a check HBC sent for $992.64 on 8/27/2024 that\nhad not yet been received.\no Another letter similar to the one noted above dated\n8/29/2024 from Finance Clerk with basically the same\ninformation listed. This letter referenced check payments\nof $992.64; $743.00 due 9/18/2024; and $742.31 due\n10/18/24; which total the $2477.95 previously stated.\no The agency provided proof the $ 2477.95 was paid by way\nof checks for $743.00 dated 9/16/2024. $742.31 dated\n10/16/2024; and $ 992.64 dated 8/27/2024. All three of\nthese payments together total the $ $2477.95.\no A 10/10/2024 letter from MDHHS (Bureau of Finance &\nAccounting- Reconciliation and Dispute Unit-MM) to HBC\nthat indicated in response to the letter received from HBC\nrequesting a total balance due MDHHS for foster care over\npayment, the Department agreed that what was stated in\nthe agency’s letter of $742.31 being the amount that was\nowed as the only balance the agency is to repay related.\nThe $ 742.31 was for Accounts Receivable (AR) Claim #\n202309114578. The agency showed proof of this payment\nby check on 10/16/2024, as referenced above.\nSince the above was reported by the agency related to the\noverpayment balance owed the state of Michigan; and since the\noriginal completion of this report on 1/14/2025, I had follow-up\ncontact with the MDHHS- Compliance Monitoring Unit and HBC.\nMDHHS-Compliance Monitoring Unit Staff\nI met with Senior Auditor, (referenced earlier in this report) his\nsupervisor, Financial Compliance Manager, and Second Auditor via\nTEAMs on 3/11/2025. Senior Auditor reported he had written a\nfinancial concern memo for the agency every year since 2019. He\nreported in November 2024, he completed the Memo of Concern\n(which resulted in this special investigation). He reported when the\nagency filed its 2023 independent financial audit report, the agency\ndid not include a management letter. He reported although the\nabsence of a management letter does not necessarily mean or imply\nanything negative, a management letter is usually included with the\nfinancial audit. Senior Auditor reported the overpayment owed by\nHBC to MDHHS is now seen as a long-term liability. He and Second\n9",
    "Auditor reported some type of notification would have been provided\nto the agency by MDHHS in the past related to these outstanding\nMDHHS overpayments.\nFinancial Compliance Manager reported typically if an agency has\noutstanding funds owed to MDHHS, the matter will go to collections,\nand there is no specific timeframe for that to occur. She reported not\nbeing able to speculate as to why HBC’s specific overpayment\nmatter might not have gone further into collections. She reported, if\nan agency is trying to pay back funds, her department will get that\nagency to the right department. She reported to her knowledge, no\none from HBC reached out to her department to ask about this\noverpayment debt.\nOn 3/11/2025, and 3/13/2025 via email Senior Auditor provided me\nvarious financial documents which consisted of:\no A “Collection Notice-Foster Agencies” letter to HBC dated\n9/12/2018. This letter indicated MDHHS was pursuing\noverpayments that occurred in April 2014 and discovered in\nor after July 2016. The letter indicated that the overpayment\nprocess would be ongoing to collect all identified\noverpayments, even for older services dates and that the\nagency would be liable for all overpayments until repayment\nis made. This letter indicated the total overpayment at that\ntime was $123,787.36.\no “A Total Recoupment Amount” spreadsheet document for\nHBC for various warrant payment amounts ranging from\n2014 to 2017. The total amount noted as owed by the\nagency on this spreadsheet document was $123,787.36.\no An undated Outstanding Balance Accounting document, for\n“initial advance payments” on 12/8/2014 and “push advance\npayments” on 4/21/2015. This document showed in 2014,\n$161,297.73 was the initial over payments to the agency;\nand HBC made monthly payments to the department on that\ndebt until October 2022. The agency’s monthly payments\nhad ranged from $5,000.00 to $15,069.06 and a total of\n$70,000.00 was paid toward that $161,297.73. A balance of\n$91,297.73 was left. This document also showed\n$120,000.00 was owed by the agency for overpayments in\n2015, and no payments had been received from the agency.\nThe $91,297.73 balance coupled with the $120,000.00\nbalance showed the agency’s owed $211,297.73 for\noverpayments at that time.\no A copy of an email dated 10/30/2024 from Senior Auditor to\nthe Foster Care Guardianship and Adoption Division Director\nthat indicated information similarly to the 11/22/2024\n10",
    "Concern Memo and noted concern with the agency due to its\nhigh debts.\no A copy of a 3/10/2023 emails chain, initially one from Prior\nFinancial Compliance Auditor to other DHHS staff that\nindicated regarding HBC’s debt, it looked like they owed\nMDHHS $364,000.00. Then an email from the prior DCWL\nDirector. That email showed the Outstanding Balance\nAccounting document with the overpayments amounts to the\nagency, repayment amounts by the agency; and indicated\nthe previously mentioned $211,297.73 balance as owed by\nthe agency at that time.\no A copy of a 11/22/2024 Memo, to the Foster Care,\nGuardianship and Adoption Division Director, which was the\nmemo that generated this special investigation. It indicated a\ndebt for the agency of a long-term liability payable to\nMDHHS for $265,013.00.\nWhat is gleamed from this information is that the debt owed by the\nagency to the department ranges between $ 211,297.73 and\n$364,000.00.\nOn 5/06/2025 the Financial Compliance Manager replied to an\ninquiry about the details outlined in this report and responded that it\nappears to capture everything accurately. When asked about their\nfinancial standing and progress made since being placed on the\ncurrent second provisional license, she replied on 5/13/2025 stating,\n“It looks like there was only one issue related to them negotiating the\nterms of their lease, so if they have that settled then there were no\nother financial concerns noted in the audit”.\nChief Administrator (CA) follow up contact:\nI had a follow-up meeting with HBC’s CA onsite on 3/31/2025 related\nto the MDHHS overpayment amounts. I asked her about the\nmanagement letter in connection with the agency’s prior independent\nfinancial audit as mentioned by Senior Auditor. I showed CA various\ndocuments, I had received, specially, the Collection Notice-Foster\nAgencies letter dated 9/12/2018, the Total Recoupment Amount\nspreadsheet document and the undated Outstanding Balance\nAccounting document. CA acknowledged receipt of the 2018 letter\nand was familiar with the warrant documents but did not recall\nreceipt of other documents. With respect to the management letter,\nCA reported all financial auditors do not complete a management\nletter. She reported HBC’s prior financial auditor did not write one.\nShe said he gave an opinion and did not think a management letter\nwas important at that time. She reported HBC no longer uses that\n11",
    "financial auditor, but had the management letter been requested she\ncould have obtained one.\nAs for the over payment matter CA reported that in 2014 and 2015\ndue to the department reporting that agencies may not have been\nbeing paid correctly or timely for children in care, the department\nimplemented a “push payment thing”. She acknowledged the\nagency received various overpayments during that time. She\nindicated HBC should not owe the $211,297.73 or $265,013.00\nmentioned in the reports; that an amount of $152,800.06 which\nshown in one area of the Outstanding Balance Accounting document\nmay be more accurate.
