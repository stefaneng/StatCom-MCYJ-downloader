EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe first incident related to a 9/12/18 allegation that the foster father pushed the two\nfoster boys against a dresser after he woke up and found the boys trying to get their\ntablets from the foster parents’ bedroom. A corrective action plan was completed\nwith the foster parents, which consisted of the foster parents completing a licensing\nrules refresher course, and the licensing worker reviewing the behavior management\nrules with the foster parents at quarterly home visits.\nThe agency adhered to departmental timeframes. It adhered to all applicable rules\nexcept R400.1327(5)(d), which was cited earlier in this report. The agency’s actions\nin this matter appeared to have been appropriate.\nThe second incident related to a 12/4/18 allegation that the foster mother pulled one\nfoster daughter’s hair after that foster daughter refused to hit another foster daughter\nback after being instructed to do so by the foster mother. The foster home was\nfound in violation of the behavior management rules. A corrective action plan was\ncompleted with the foster parents, which consisted of the foster parent attending a\ntrauma-based behavioral management training, and the foster parents meeting with\nthe licensing worker to review the agency’s discipline policy and the behavior\nmanagement rules.\nThe agency adhered to departmental timeframes.

    "The agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.

It made significant\nimprovements related to rule/standard compliances pertaining to that corrective action\nplan. It was not totally successful with that corrective plan as indicated by the repeat\nviolations documented in this report.\nIt is noted, the agency experienced a number of staffing changes since last the\ninspection. There is a new foster care/licensing program manager, foster care\nsupervisor and office secretary. The prior program manager was promoted to division\ndirector/chief administrator. Two of the agency’s four foster care workers and one of\ntheir three licensing workers are new. The agency is adjusting to these changes and\nhave been working diligently to train all staff and to improve it rule compliance standing.\nIt also noted, the agency is requesting approval to provide independent living services.\nPolicies and procedures for this service category were previously submitted; and\nrecommended amendments to those policies have been submitted.\nDCWL ANALYST CONCERNS ADDRESSED:\nSafety Alert #1: No concerns.\nSafety Alert #2: No Concerns\nSafety Alert # 3:\nConcern:\nThe foster parent requested assistance from the foster care worker to obtain a copy of\nthe educational assessment that was completed through Detroit Public School. The\nfoster care worker has not assisted. The assessment was completed in February 2019.\nResolution:\nCase documentation showed that the foster care worker was assisting the relative foster\nparent in obtaining a special education assessment for the child via the Detroit Public\nSchool system. MISAWCIS documentation indicated an assessment took place\n2/27/19. The agency reported the foster parent, who has contact with the school reports\nthe full assessment had not been completed. The agency is following up with the\nrelative foster parent and the school.\nConcern:\n15",
    "The foster parent is concerned the child might have ADHD. The child might need a\nreferral for Infant Mental Health Services.\nResolution:\nThe agency received assignment of this case 7/30/18. The agency was unaware of the\nrelative foster parent’s concern of the child possibly being ADHD. This nor a request for\na Mental Health Service were reported by the relative foster parent. The agency will\naddress these concerns with the relative foster parent at the next foster home visit.\nConcern:\nThe child did not receive an Early On assessment despite one being requested by the\nfoster parent.\nResolution:\nThe agency reported the child was referred for Early On Services. MISACWIS\ncase documentation showed the child (now age three) was referred for Early On\nServices three times. The child was originally referred on 5/11/17 while under the care\nand direct supervision of Oakland County DHHS. DHHS referred the child again on\n10/15/18. Past social work contacts for 7/26/17 and 9/21/17 indicated the child was\nparticipating in Early-On Services. The latter contact indicated the relative foster parent\nreported Early On visited with the child four times. Then that these services were no\nlonger needed. Early On Service referral paper work was completed for the child again\non 12/3/18, but due to the child’s age, she was then referred for assessment via the\nDetroit Public school system.\nConcern:\nThe foster parent has not participated in at least one Family Team Meeting.\nResolution:\nMISACWIS case documentation showed the agency completed two FTMs (11/16/18\nand 2/15/19) since receipt of the child’s case on 7/30/18. MISACWIS social work\ncontact showed the 11/16/18 FTM took place in the relative foster parent’s home. A\nDHS -1105 FTM form was completed, the relative foster parent did not sign it.\nSafety Alert #4:\nConcern:\nThe child that is placed in the home requires a wheel chair. The home does not have a\na wheelchair ramp. The child is currently in a safety plan with a relative. The home\ndoes not have wheelchair ramp.\nResolution:\nThe agency reported the child was previously placed in this relative’s home and\nreturned to this placement after special investigation concerns surfaced pertaining to the\nrelative the child was placed with. A portable wooden ramp is currently being used while\nthe relative works with MORC to secure a permanent ramp.\n16",
