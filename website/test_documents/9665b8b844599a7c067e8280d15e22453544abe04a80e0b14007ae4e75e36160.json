    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404 Placement.\nSection (4) An agency shall consider all of the following factors in selecting\nDescription an appropriate placement for a child:\n(b) The physical, emotional, and educational needs of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The relative care provider refused access to a room in the home\nand indicated it had never been viewed by the agency, even\nthough the 3130A noted otherwise. The relative reported that\nthere was a hole in the roof in the room. When following up on this\nseveral months later, the agency did not know the status of the\nrepairs.\nInvestigation The investigation was opened 02/21/23, to follow up on an\nunresolved safety alert dated 4/21/22. The complainant, a DCWL\nManager, noted the following: On 4/21/2022 a relative refused to\nallow a DCWL agency analyst to do a walkthrough of the home.\nWhen asked if there were any safety concerns, the relative\nreported her bedroom was off limits and had never been viewed\nby the agency, although the agency noted in the 3130A that all\nrooms, including the relative’s bedroom had been viewed. DCWL\ncompleted a safety alert due to not being able to tour the home.\nThe relative disclosed to the agency the reason she refused to\nallow a walk through was because there was a hole in the roof in\nthat room but stated no one used it. The safety plan was that no\none would use that room until repairs were made, and the relative\nwas to seek quotes from contractors so resources could be\nsecured for the repairs. As of 2/17/2023, the agency had no idea\nwhether the repairs were made or not.\nThe agency was notified of the investigation on 2/24/23. The\nrelative care provider took placement of her great nephew on\n8/6/21. He was 17 years old at the time of placement.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nReview of the relative placement home study (3130A), dated\n8/30/21, completed by Staff 1. The 3130A does not identify any\nsafety alerts or issues and does not include any information about\na hole or holes in the ceiling. The author of the report is no longer\nemployed with the agency and therefore cannot verify the\ncondition of the home and the rooms that were observed.\n2",
    "Review of the safety alert dated 4/21/22. Safety alert indicates the\nrelative refused entry of the analyst into her home to review for\nany safety concerns. The relative indicated the bedroom was off\nlimits and had never been viewed by the agency. The safety alert\nhas the agency’s response on the bottom of the alert which\nindicates Staff 1 did a complete walk through of the home on\n11/11/21 (Initial 3130 A was dated 8/30/21) to complete the\n3130A. The worker confirmed she did a complete home tour and\nviewed all of the rooms including the relative's bedroom. The\nrelative decided to not move ahead with licensure and the\nlicensing case was closed by the agency on 2/8/22. On 4/21/22,\nthe foster care worker was out at the home and the relative\ndisclosed to her that she didn't let the DCWL analyst in because\nthe home has a hole in the roof that is located in an unused\nbedroom. A safety plan was developed by the agency and the\nrelative regarding the bedroom with the hole in the ceiling.\nReview of the safety plan dated 4/22/22. The safety plan outlines\nthat the relative and youth living in the home will not use the\nbedroom that has the hole in the ceiling and that the relative\nagrees to get quotes to have the hole repaired. The relative and\nyouth both agreed to notify the agency if any safety concerns\narise.\nReview of the Updated 3130A completed on 8/30/22. The report\nindicates there is ceiling damage in a bedroom on the first floor\nand a hole in the ceiling in a bedroom on the second floor. The\nreport indicates the relative will be getting an estimate by 9/9/22\nfor the repairs.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed the DCWL analyst via phone on 2/27/23. She\nreported she did not view the rooms in the relative's home as the\nrelative refused. She reported she emailed with the agency’s\nLicensing Supervisor on 2/20/23, who reported the relative is\nrefusing resources to fix the ceilings. The relative caretaker\nreported she only wants a relative to complete the repairs. She\nreported a relative did make repairs to stop the leakage upstairs\nbut didn't repair the drywall and the hole in the ceiling remains. No\nwork has been done on the lower-level damage.\nI interviewed the relative care provider on 2/28/23 via the phone.\nShe reported that two staff members from the agency saw the\nhole in her ceiling around the time her nephew was placed in her\nhome. The relative care provider reported she didn't like the\nDCWL analyst that came out in April, and she did not tell her the\n3",
    "truth when she said the agency staff had not seen the hole in the\nbedroom ceiling. The relative care provider reported staff from the\nagency did see all the rooms in the house. The relative care\nprovider did not let the analyst walk through her home. There was\nonly one hole in the downstairs bedroom at the time her nephew\nwas placed in her home, and no one occupied that room. The\nrelative care provider reported that her nephew's bedroom is\nupstairs and does not have any issues with the ceiling/leaks.\nThere is an additional bedroom upstairs that has developed a leak\nand this room is also not occupied. The relative care provider\nreported that the leak was recently fixed but the hole in the ceiling\nremains. The relative care provider reported she is 72 years old\nand on a fixed income and cannot afford to fix the roof of her\nhome, but she is slowly working on trying to get a person to fix the\nholes in the ceiling. The relative care provider reported she was\nasked to get repair estimates from the agency but has not\nprovided them. The relative care provider denied that the agency\nhad offered funds/FIG to assist with fixing the holes in the ceiling.\nThe licensing supervisor reported that the licensing worker who\ndid the initial 3130A did see all the rooms, as that is what she\nreported in supervision. The safety alert indicates a home visit\nwas done on 11/11/21 when the report was dated August 2021.\nThe licensing supervisor reported that was a typo and the home\nvisit and walk through was done on 8/24/21. The Licensing\nSupervisor reported that the relative has not provided estimates\nas requested. They have asked for them and the relative is\nbecoming upset with them as she does not want to fix them. The\nlicensing supervisor provided a list of dates that indicated a worker\nwas in the home and assessing for safety. There were no noted\nconcerns related to safety and some months there was\ndocumentation of discussing the need for estimates and how to\nget the rooms repaired as well as paperwork to complete for\nassistance with paying for the ceiling repairs.\nReviewed foster home visits forms that indicated the youth was\nassessed to be safe in the home.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation there is no evidence to\nsupport the physical, emotional or educational needs of the 17-\nyear-old youth are unmet. His bedroom was noted to not have any\nissues. The relative’s home has two unused bedrooms that are in\nneed of repair due to water/leak damage. Both rooms are not\noccupied, and the agency developed a safety plan that was\nfollowed by the relative. The agency made attempts to encourage\nthe relative to get estimates, but she is not interested in having an\n4",
    "outsider complete the work. The physical, emotional and\neducational needs of the child are being met.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe agency’s home visit form has a section related to safety. The\nsection has the worker assess and indicate if the child is safe in\nthe home. The form also has a section titled safety concerns. If a\nsafety plan is in place, it should be noted on the form in the safety\nconcerns section. The person doing the visit should be checking\non the safety plan compliance and documenting it.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 10, 2023\n______________________________________\nTracey Ventola Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 10, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n5"
