The one\nCAP submitted was in response to the 7/15/2022 licensing renewal inspection\nreport and was approved on 7/21/2022. That CAP addressed 13 violations, 10 of\nwhich have been adequately addressed as evidenced by not being repeated\nduring this inspection. The three violations repeated during this inspection,\n6",
    "medical passports, PATP signatures, FTM documentation were not found to be\npervasive or chronic and attempts to achieve compliance in all three areas were\ndocumented. Three violations were established during this inspection that have\nnot been cited during the past two licensing reviews. Two of the 3 were single,\nisolated incidents of non-compliance. The other was found in 2 of 8 files reviewed,\none of which was worker failure to enter documentation. Overall, the violations\nfound during this inspection are the result of, new staff needing additional\neducation, individual staff member uploading delays, and outside factors causing\ndelays in obtaining/completing required signatures/documents and do not\nrepresent agency lack of attempts to achieve compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was received and reviewed, as well as\ndiscussed during the entrance meeting. The chief administrator identified the main\nbarrier to achieving compliance was staff turnover, including a 65% management\nchange, during the period under review. The chief administrator indicated that\nthere has been an increase in overall compliance due to implementation of an\neffective CAP resulting from the 2022 inspection and that current areas of non-\ncompliance are isolated to specific staff performance.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nNo concerns were reported. The staff members interviewed reported that, despite\nseveral supervisory/management changes, the support and guidance they receive\nhas remained consistent.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have adequate space and equipment to perform job\nresponsibilities. Open and closed records are stored in a method that prevents\nunauthorized access through the use of locked cabinets and lockable storage\nshelves.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns identified.\n7",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJune 12, 2023\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 12, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
