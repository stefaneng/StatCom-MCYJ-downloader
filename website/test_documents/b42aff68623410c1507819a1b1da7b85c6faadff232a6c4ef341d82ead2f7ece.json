Subsequent medical passports are not\n required after reunification.\n• The child’s foster care provider:\n At or prior to each placement.\n Quarterly.\nOne of six foster care files did not have quarterly updated medical passports.

    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse or neglect during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. An investigation was initiated in July 2021 due to allegations the substitute\ncaregiver’s significant other would ‘swat’ an 8-year-old foster child. The investigation\nwas completed and found a violation of rule 9403(1d) regarding behavior\nmanagement. A CAP was approved on 9/21/2021. The CAP was completed and\nclosed on 11/10/2021. The investigation and CAP were reviewed and found to be in\ncompliance with licensing rules.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP, approved 12/16/2020, was a\nresult of the renewal evaluation dated 11/30/2020. The CAP addressed violations\nregarding medical passports, PATPs, Family Team Meetings, and action summaries\n(DHS-69). During this interim review, the agency had three repeat violations, which\nrequire development of a new CAP. In the exit meeting the CA noted that two of the\nviolations, timely contact entry and completion of family assessments, continues to\nbe a struggle for the agency due to the strict timeframe requirements. While the\nagency had some repeat violations, overall, the review showed a minimal number of\ninstances for each violation and significant compliance in several areas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed. The CA reported\nthe CAP from the 2020 renewal evaluation has been implemented. The CAP\nincluded additional training and use of new tools for tracking and compliance. The\nCA stated that staffing has remained steady over the past year. There are some\nupcoming changes expected, but the CA expects the changes will positively impact\nstaff. The CA indicated that staff continue to balance their time between the office\nand working remotely due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, it\ncontinues to be challenging at times for staff to complete some face-to-face\nmeetings and obtaining signatures, due to illness and quarantine.\nInterviews\nTwo staff were interviewed. The staff have been with the agency for over a year.\nBoth staff report the agency to be a very supportive environment. Both staff stated\ntheir supervisors are knowledgeable and provide excellent supervision. Neither staff\nhad suggestions for improvements that could be made at the agency.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\n7",
    "an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n_ _______________November 23, 2021__________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 23, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
