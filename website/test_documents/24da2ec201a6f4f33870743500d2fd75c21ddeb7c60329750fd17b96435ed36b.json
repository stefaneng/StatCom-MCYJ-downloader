Youth A reported Staff 1 said she had a\nproblem with Youth A’s shirt because it wasn’t covering her butt,\nand Staff 1 told Youth A to go change. Youth A reported she\nasked Staff 1 if she could call her mom first because she was\nstruggling, and Youth A agreed to change her shirt after she called\nher mom. Staff 1 told Youth A she couldn’t call her mom until she\nchanged her shirt. Youth A reported she told Staff 1 they weren’t\nleaving the unit until later and agreed to change her shirt before\nshe left the unit, but again requested the ability to call her mom\nfirst. Youth A reported Staff 1 had an evident attitude towards her,\nand Youth A was very frustrated, so she repeatedly asked Staff 1\nto stop talking to her, but Staff 1 wouldn’t stop. Youth A reported\nStaff 2 was in the kitchen and said she would allow Youth A to call\nher mom, but Staff 1 intervened and said no one could call Youth\nA’s mom until Youth A changed her shirt. Youth A reported she\nagain asked Staff 1 to stop talking to her, but Staff 1 said, “I don’t\nhave to stop. I can talk to you any way I want”. Youth A reported\nshe was trying to walk away, but Staff 1 continued to talk to her.\nYouth A reported she asked Staff 1 approximately 4-6 more times\n2",
    "to stop talking to her, but Staff 1 continued and wouldn’t back\ndown.\nYouth A reported Staff 2 tried to intervene and told Staff 1 to stop\ntalking to Youth A, but Staff 1 still wouldn’t stop. Youth A reported\nStaff 2 was trying to de-escalate the situation, but Staff 1 was\nmaking no efforts to do so.\nYouth A reported she picked up a lotion bottle and threw it at Staff\n1 intending to hit her, but the bottle didn’t hit Staff 1. Staff 1 said,\n“little girl, don’t throw anything at me”. Youth A reported she got in\nStaff 1’s face and told her to stop talking to her again, but Staff 1\nstill wouldn’t stop. Staff 1 pushed Youth A and said, “get out of my\nface”. Youth A reported she then pushed Staff 1 twice and\npunched Staff 1 in her face. Youth A reported Staff 1 retaliated\nand was punching her as well as pulling her hair. Youth A reported\nStaff 1 also attempted to kick her in the stomach, but Staff 3\nintervened and stopped it from happening. Youth A reported Staff\n2 separated her and Staff 1, and Staff 1 went into the staff office.\nYouth A reported as Staff 1 went into the office, she told Youth A\nshe was going to “get her people to come beat her up”. Youth A\nreported she then ran into the staff office and began fighting with\nStaff 1 again. Youth A reported she and Staff 1 were both\nthrowing punches at each other. Youth A reported Staff 3 got in\nbetween them to separate them while Staff 2 was trying to verbally\nde-escalate the situation. Youth A reported after they were\nseparated, Staff 4 brought her to the TV room to cool down. Youth\nA reported she had a mark on her face, a bruise on the top of her\nleft forearm, a scratch on her hand, a scratch on her neck, and\ntwo broken nails because of the altercation. Youth A reported her\nneck is still sore because of Staff 1 pulling her hair.\nYouth B reported she was in the milieu with Youth C and Youth D\nwatching a movie. Youth B reported Staff 1 came back from\nworking at another unit on campus, and started saying very\nnegative things such as “those girls on the other unit are more\nrespectful, have manners, and act better than all of you”. Youth B\nreported she felt Staff 1 immediately put everyone in a bad mood\nand was just trying to start stuff as soon as she walked onto the\nmilieu. Youth B reported if youth are off the unit, and they have\nleggings on, they must have their bottoms covered; however, if\nthey are on the unit, they are allowed to wear leggings without\nhaving their bottoms covered. Youth B reported after Staff 1 spoke\nnegatively towards them, she started to go around to each youth\nwho had leggings on and nitpicking their outfits, which made them\n3",
    "all upset because no other staff said anything to them about their\nclothes all day.\nYouth B reported Staff 1 went in front of the kitchen window and\nbegan talking to Staff 2. Youth A came out of the TV room\nrequesting to call her mom. Youth B reported Staff 1 immediately\ntold Youth A she needed to put a longer shirt on since she had\nleggings on, and she couldn’t call her mom until she did. Youth B\nreported Youth A then asked Staff 2 if she could call her mom,\nand Staff 1 intervened by saying “No [Staff 2], [Youth A] has to put\na longer shirt on”. Youth A told Staff 1 to stop talking to her and\nStaff 1 said, “I don’t have to stop talking to you”. Youth B reported\nYouth A threw a hair product bottle and tissue box at Staff 1 and\nthen got in Staff 1’s face. Staff 1 pushed Youth A and Youth A\npushed Staff 1 back. Youth B reported after they pushed each\nother, Staff 1 and Youth A began punching each other, and pulling\neach other’s hair. Youth B reported Staff 2 was trying to intervene\nand break them up, and repeatedly told Staff 1 to walk away, but\nStaff 1 would not walk away. Staff 1 eventually stated the reason\nshe couldn’t walk away was because Youth A had a hold of her\nhair. Youth B reported after the fight went on for a bit, Staff 3 took\nYouth B, Youth C and Youth D to their rooms, so they couldn’t see\nwhat else happened.\nYouth B reported if Staff 1 hadn’t come onto the unit with a bad\nattitude and rude comments to begin with, it might have stopped\neverything from escalating to the extent it did. Youth B reported\nYouth A repeatedly asked Staff 1 to stop talking to her, and Staff 1\nmade no efforts to walk away, de-escalate the situation or back\ndown from her request for Youth A to change clothes.\nYouth C reported Staff 1 came onto the unit bragging about how\nthe female youth on another unit were so much better behaved\nand listened better than the girls on this unit. Youth C reported\nYouth A asked Staff 1 if she could talk to her mom, but Staff 1 said\nshe wouldn’t make the call until Youth A changed her shirt. Youth\nA told Staff 1 she wanted to talk to her mom because she was\nhaving a bad day and needed to calm down, but Staff 1 still\nwouldn’t allow her to call her mom. Youth C reported Staff 1\npushed Youth A, and Youth A pushed Staff 1 back and then\npunched Staff 1. Youth C reported she didn’t see much after that\nbecause Staff 3 put her, Youth B and Youth D in their rooms.\nHowever, Youth C reported she could still hear some of what was\ngoing on and she heard Staff 2 repeatedly telling Staff 1 to walk\naway, and asked Staff 1 and Youth A to stop fighting.\n4",
    "Youth C reported all the youth in the facility have trauma, and\nStaff 1 should have understood that, as well as the fact that she’s\nan adult and should have worked to de-escalate the situation\nrather than escalating it further. Youth C reported Staff 1 doesn’t\nunderstand the youths’ needs or triggers, and she’s going to end\nup creating more trauma for them. Youth C reported Staff 1 is a\nbully, not a nice person, and argues with the youth all the time.\nYouth D reported she was in the milieu braiding Youth C’s hair\nwhen Staff 1 entered the unit and started bragging the female\nyouth on another unit were so much better than them. Youth D\nreported Staff 1 said, “the girls on Riebel are so much better\nbehaved and more respectful than all of you”. Youth D reported\nStaff 1’s comments immediately put everyone in a bad mood.\nYouth D reported Staff 1 makes the environment more stressful\nevery time she works.\nYouth D reported after Staff 1 made her comments, Youth A came\nout of the TV room and asked Staff 1 if she could call her mom.\nYouth D reported Staff 2 was in the kitchen making lunch and\nStaff 3 was in the staff office completing trainings. Youth D\nreported Staff 1 told her she couldn’t call her mom until she put on\na shirt that covered her bottom since she was wearing leggings.\nYouth A explained to Staff 1 she was having a bad day and really\nneeded to call her mom but offered to change her clothes as soon\nas the call was over. Youth D reported instead of compromising,\nStaff 1 took the opportunity to nit-pick the shirt situation and\ninstigate the situation further. Youth D reported Youth A asked to\ncall her mom again and promised she would change her shirt after\nthe call, but Staff 1 continued to refuse. Youth A yelled and said,\n“just let me call my mom!”. Youth D reported Staff 1 responded, “I\ndon’t know who you think you’re talking to. Put on a longer shirt”.\nYouth D reported Youth A threw a tissue box and a hair product\nbottle at Staff 1. Youth D reported Staff 1 took a step towards\nYouth A, so Youth A got into Staff 1’s face and began yelling at\nher. Youth D reported Staff 1 shoved Youth A, so Youth A shoved\nStaff 1 back and punched her. Youth D reported Staff 1 began\nreturning punches, so both Staff 1 and Youth A were punching\neach other. Youth D reported Staff 2 came out of the kitchen, told\nthem to stop and tried to intervene, while Staff 3 put Youth B,\nYouth C, and Youth D in their rooms. Youth D reported she heard\na lot of yelling after she got into her room but couldn’t see what\nelse happened. Youth D reported Youth A has never put her\nhands on a staff before, even when she’s angry. Youth D reported\nYouth A has thrown objects, yelled, etc., but that’s it.\n5",
    "Staff 1 reported on Saturday 10/26/24, just before lunch, she\ncame onto the unit from another unit. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was\nin the kitchen making lunch and Youth B, Youth C and Youth D\nwere in the milieu. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 asked her how Riebel\nwas, and Staff 1 told Staff 2 how sweet the girls on Riebel were.\nStaff 1 reported she asked Staff 2 where Youth A was, and Staff 2\nreported she was in the TV room. Staff 1 reported the youth were\ndressed inappropriately. Staff 1 reported one youth’s shirt wasn’t\nlong enough, didn’t have straps and her pants were too tight, and\nanother youth had too short of a shirt on. Staff 1 reported she told\nthe youth in the milieu to change into more appropriate outfits and\nthey complied. Staff 1 reported she went to the TV room, knocked\non the door, and waved to Youth A. Staff 1 reported she went\nback to the window to the kitchen and began talking to Staff 2\nagain. Staff 1 reported Youth A came into the milieu and was\ntalking to her so they could catch up. Staff 1 reported she noticed\nYouth A was wearing a crop top sweater unzipped, with no shirt\nunderneath and tight yoga pants on. Staff 1 reported she told\nYouth A she needed to put a shirt on underneath her sweater and\nYouth A became very irritated because no other staff told her she\nneeded to change. Staff 1 reported initially, Youth A agreed to\nchanging, but then she turned around and asked to call her mom.\nStaff 1 reported she told Youth A she would make the phone call\nfor her after Youth A changed her clothes, and Youth A agreed.\nStaff 1 reported she didn’t know what happened after, but Youth A\nbecame very antsy and then said she didn’t want to change her\nshirt. Staff 1 reported she told Youth A she wouldn’t make the\nphone call until Youth A changed her shirt. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA then became aggressive. Staff 1 reported Youth A went to the\nkitchen window and asked Staff 2 to make the phone call to her\nmom. Staff 1 said, “we agreed you would put a shirt on and then I\nwould make your phone call because you’re not appropriately\ndressed”. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 asked what was going on, so\nshe explained the situation to Staff 2. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nsaid, “please stop talking to me”. Staff 1 reported she knew if a\nyouth says that, the expectation is for her to stop talking because\nshe learned that from licensing, so she stopped talking.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A walked behind the staff desk in the milieu\nand said, “shut the fuck up talking to me”. Staff 1 reported she\nwasn’t talking to Youth A, so she wasn’t sure why Youth A said it.\nStaff 1 reported she was going to let Youth A vent, but because\nthey have a good rapport, she felt she could address it. Staff 1\nreported she said, “[Youth A] you’re not being safe right now and I\ncan’t make your phone call because I can’t get to the office”. Staff\n6",
    "1 reported Youth A threw two things at her and she blocked them.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A said, “shut the fuck up. I’m about to hit\nyou”. Staff 1 reported Youth A charged at her, and hit her directly\nin the eye, which caused her to lose vision. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA got a hold of her hair, and Staff 1 told Staff 2 she couldn’t get\naway from Youth A because Youth A had a hold of her hair. Staff\n1 reported Staff 2 was standing next to them and wasn’t doing\nanything to help or intervene. Staff 1 reported she was trying to\nget Youth A’s hands off her hair and was yelling for someone to\nget Youth A off her. Staff 1 reported she couldn’t remember how\nshe finally got away.\nStaff 1 reported she tried to get to the staff office to call for help\nbecause Staff 3 was in the staff office doing training. Staff 1\nreported Youth A gripped her hair again in the front of the staff\noffice and Staff 1 was begging Youth A to let her go. Staff 1\nreported she was trying to lean Youth A against the wall so she\ncould get away from Youth A and prevent Youth A from tearing\nout anymore of her hair. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was yelling at\nYouth A to get off Staff 1, but she wasn’t listening. Staff 1 reported\nshe was finally able to get away from Youth A and went into the\nstaff office. Staff 1 reported she called 911 while Youth A was\nattacking her in the office. Staff 1 reported somehow, someone\n(she didn’t know who) got Youth A out of the staff office. Staff 1\nreported she called Supervisor 3 to notify her she was attacked\nrepeatedly by Youth A. Staff 1 reported while she was on the\nphone, Youth A was still banging on the office door. Staff 1\nreported she had a headache, her vision was blurry, she couldn’t\nbreathe, she had an asthma attack, and she was throwing up.\nStaff 1 reported Staff 4 took Youth A to another part of the unit so\nStaff 1 could come out of the office safely.\nStaff 1 reported while Youth A was attacking her repeatedly, she\nhad to defend herself because no one was helping her. Staff 1\nreported she never hit, punched, pulled hair or scratched Youth A.\nStaff 1 reported she might have pushed Youth A in self-defense,\nbut that’s all she did. Staff 1 admitted she knew Youth A calling\nher mom was one of her coping skills, but she didn’t feel like she\ncould safely call Youth A's mom because she couldn’t verify\nwhether she needed to monitor the call or not. Staff 1 reported she\ndidn’t walk away or leave the unit when things were escalating\nbecause the ratio is 1 staff to 3 youth and Staff 3 did not count in\nratio because she was in training. Staff 1 reported she didn’t call\nfor help because Youth A was escalated by the office. Staff 1\nreported she felt she could talk to Youth A, and she would calm\ndown because they have a good rapport. Staff 1 reported Staff 2\n7",
    "offered to call Youth A’s mom, but she never followed through.\nStaff 1 reported she never told Youth A “no” to calling her mom.\nStaff 1 reported she did not feel a power struggle occurred\nbecause she doesn’t feel holding youth accountable to unit\nexpectations is a power struggle. Staff 1 reported she is always\ngoing to follow the rules, and it was the other three staff over the\ncourse of the day who didn’t follow the rules and address the\ndress code with the youth.\nStaff 2 reported she was working the morning shift on Saturday\nand was making lunch. Staff 2 reported Youth A came to the\nkitchen window and appeared agitated. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nhad come out of the TV room and asked to call her mom, but her\ninteraction with Staff 1 was confrontational on Staff 1’s part. Staff\n2 reported Staff 1 made immediate comments about the length of\nYouth A’s shirt. Staff 2 reported they enforce the policy more when\nthey go into the community, but it’s more relaxed on the unit. Staff\n2 reported Staff 1 continued to make comments about the length\nof Youth A’s shirt, and Youth A was getting more upset with each\ncomment. Staff 2 reported Youth A asked Staff 1 to stop talking to\nher and leave her alone multiple times, but Staff 1 wouldn’t stop.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A said she just wanted to make a call to her\nmom, and Staff 1 told her she couldn’t make the call until she\nchanged her shirt. Staff 2 reported she overruled Staff 1 and said,\n“give me a minute, and I’ll let you call your mom”. Staff 1 reported\nshe knew Youth A would calm down when she talked to her mom\nand there was no reason Youth A couldn’t call her mom. Staff 2\nreported no sooner than she was leaving the kitchen, she heard a\ncommotion in the milieu before she saw what was happening.\nStaff 2 reported she heard Youth A using a lot of profanity and\nsaying, “I told you to get out of my fucking face. I told you to leave\nme alone”. Staff 2 reported as she exited the kitchen, she saw\nYouth A and Staff 1 having a full physical altercation where they\nwere both kicking, punching and pulling each other’s hair. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 was trying to get away but couldn’t because Youth\nA had a hold of Staff 1’s hair. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 punched\nYouth A 3-4 times in her upper body. Staff 2 reported she tried to\nget in the middle of them to get them apart, but they wouldn’t\nseparate. Staff 2 reported Staff 3 was present, but she is not\nAEGIS restraint trained, so she could not help with a physical\nintervention. Staff 2 told Staff 3 to get the other youth into their\nrooms to ensure their safety, so she did. Staff 2 reported Youth A\npulled some of Staff 1’s hair out, and Staff 1 was able to break\nfree and get into the staff office. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 called\n8",
    "Supervisor 3 and Staff 2 reported she called Staff 4 to request\nassistance.\nStaff 2 reported while she was checking on Staff 1 in the staff\noffice, Youth A entered the staff office and began hitting Staff 1\nagain. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 began hitting Youth A back again.\nStaff 2 reported once again, she was trying to verbally de-escalate\nthe situation and get in the middle of Youth A and Staff 1 to\nseparate them. Staff 2 reported Youth A finally snapped out of it,\nand left the office, so Staff 2 shut the staff office door and made\nsure it was secure. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 called 911 while she\nwas in the office. Staff 2 reported even though Staff 3 could not\nphysically intervene by restraining Youth A, she could have\nphysically intervened by restraining Staff 1 to help separate them.\nStaff 2 reported two of Youth A’s nails were broken and bleeding,\nand she had a scratch on her face from Staff 1. Staff 2 reported\nher main concern was Staff 1’s actions and verbal altercation with\nYouth A that escalated the situation. Staff 2 reported she felt Staff\n1 instigated the situation rather than de-escalating it. Staff 2\nreported she has received multiple complaints from the youth\nabout Staff 1. Staff 2 reported the youth have told her Staff 1 is\ndemanding, authoritative, nit-picky, and does not treat them like\npeople. Staff 2 reported she notified Supervisor 3 of these\nconcerns previously. Staff 2 reported Youth A has made it very\nclear with staff if they have a conversation with her rather than\ntalking at her, it helps reduce her anger, and this is something all\nstaff are aware of.\nSupervisor 1 reported he was working as the evening campus\nsupervisor for support, and he received a call from Staff 5 asking if\nhe was on campus because Staff 1 got into a physical altercation\nwith Youth A. Supervisor 1 reported he arrived at the unit at the\nsame time the police were arriving. Supervisor 1 reported when he\nentered the unit, Staff 2 and Staff 3 were talking to Youth A and\nStaff 1 was in the staff office. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 4 took\nYouth A off the unit, while Staff 1 went outside to speak with the\npolice. Supervisor 1 reported he retrieved Staff 1’s keys and put\nher on leave because of the altercation, which she accepted with\nno issues. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 was checked out by the\nparamedics in the ambulance, while Supervisor 2 took Youth A to\nthe hospital to receive assessment and treatment.\nSupervisor 2 reported she was the on-call supervisor on\n10/26/24, and she received a call from Supervisor 3 notifying her\nwhat was going on. Supervisor 2 reported when she arrived on\ncampus, the police and ambulance were present. Supervisor 2\n9",
    "reported she saw Staff 1 sitting in the police car and Staff 1 told\nher she was assaulted. Supervisor 2 reported she saw Supervisor\n1 and Supervisor 1 told her Staff 1 was put on administrative leave\ndue to the situation. Supervisor 2 reported she went on the unit,\nwhich was a disaster. Supervisor 2 reported she went to talk to\nYouth A, and saw Youth A was crying, her hands were bleeding,\nshe had hair pulled out (she had braids), and she had a couple\nbroken nails. Supervisor 2 reported she did a full injury check and\nnoticed there was bleeding scratch on Youth A’s face, and another\none on her neck. Supervisor 2 took Youth A to the hospital to\naddress her injuries.\nSupervisor 3 reported she is the home supervisor for the unit,\nand she received a call from Staff 1 stating she just got into a fight\nwith Youth A. Staff 1 told Supervisor 3 she “had to hit [Youth A] in\norder to get [Youth A] off her”. Supervisor 3 hung up with Staff 1\nand made calls to other points of authority and on call therapist\nsince this situation was considered a critical incident. Supervisor 3\nreported she talked to Youth A over the phone, and Youth A said\nher nails were hurt, Staff 1 pulled her hair, and she didn’t know if\nshe was okay. Supervisor 3 reported Youth A was taken to the\nhospital to be assessed. Supervisor 3 reported she called Staff 1\nlater in the evening to check on her and let her know an\ninvestigation would occur regarding the incident. Supervisor 3\nreported Staff 1 told her she went to the hospital because she was\nhyperventilating and was throwing up. Supervisor 3 reported she\nhas never received any complaints about Staff 1’s interactions\nwith youth prior to this incident. Supervisor 3 reported Youth A’s\nphone calls with her mom have always been supervised, so she\ndoesn’t know why there would be any confusion regarding\nwhether the calls could be supervised or unsupervised.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 12/6/24. Staff 3 reported\nYouth A came out of the TV room and asked Staff 1 to call her\nmom. Staff 3 reported when Youth A entered the TV room, she\nhad a crop top and leggings on, but she had put on a sweatshirt\non by the time she came out of the TV room. Staff 3 reported she\ndidn’t see anything wrong with Youth A’s outfit because the\nsweatshirt was longer. Staff 3 reported she could not hear Staff\n1’s response to Youth A’s request. Staff 3 reported she went into\nthe staff office to do training, and a short while later heard a verbal\naltercation occurring in the milieu. Staff 3 reported when she came\nout of the office, she heard Youth A repeatedly asked Staff 1 to\nstop talking to her, but Staff 1 kept saying little things to Youth A\nand would not stop talking to her. Staff 3 reported Youth A got in\nStaff 1’s face and told Staff 1 to stop talking to her.\n10",
    "Staff 3 reported something happened between Youth A getting in\nStaff 1’s face and the initial punch, but she couldn’t see what it\nwas. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 and Youth A were both punching\neach other, and neither of them were backing down. Staff 3\nreported at one point, Staff 2 was able to get Staff 1 into the staff\noffice, but Youth A pushed past Staff 2 and began assaulting Staff\n1 again. Staff 3 reported she was a new staff and could not\nphysically intervene in the fight by restraining Youth A because\nshe had not yet been trained in their restraint model. Staff 3\nreported Staff 2 got in between Staff 1 and Youth A to intervene\nand try to separate them, but Youth A kept finding her way back to\nassault Staff 1. Staff 3 reported even though Youth A was more\naggressive and kept finding her way back to fight Staff 1, she fully\nbelieved Youth A was triggered by Staff 1, and it could have been\navoided. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 should have stopped talking to\nYouth A after the multiple times Youth A asked her to, and\nbecause Staff 1 didn’t stop, Staff 3 felt like Staff 1 completely\ninstigated the situation. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 had a “stand my\nground” mentality and wouldn’t quit. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 never\nwalked away, tried to get another staff involved, or tried to de-\nescalate the situation like she should have. Staff 3 reported even\nafter Youth A tried to talk to Staff 2 about calling her mom, Staff 1\nkept injecting herself into the conversation and wouldn’t walk\naway.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 10/26/24 was reviewed.
