    "ALLEGATION:\nCommunity Care Organization independent living youth are locked out of their home,\nJoann House.\nINVESTIGATION:\nStaff person 1\nI interviewed Staff person 1 on 04/12/2021 and 05/17/2021 by telephone. Staff\nperson 1 stated the youth do not have a front door key and the front door remains\nlocked to Joann House. Staff person 1 stated Joann House provided front door keys\nin the past to the youth, but the keys were lost or copied and kept by discharged\nyouth causing multiple lock replacements. Staff person 1 stated she and the case\nmanagers work at Joann House 8:30 am to 5:00 pm on business weekdays and a\nstaff person is at the house 3:00 pm to 7:00 am every day of the week to open the\nfront door for the youth. Staff person 1 stated youth inside the home are permitted to\nopen the front door to other Joann House youth.

    "ANALYSIS: The front door to Joann House is locked and Joann House\nyouth are not provided a front door key due to past issues of lost\nkeys and unauthorized copying of the front door key. Joann\nHouse typically has a staff person at the house on business\nworkdays, who can open the front door. Youth inside Joann\nHouse are permitted to open the front door to allow another\nJoann House youth in. Youth can call the 24-hour, 7 day a week\ncontact numbers for staff to come and open the front door if\nnobody is at the house. It is found that it may be inconvenient\nfor youth not to have a front door key, but youth are not locked\noutside of Joann House without means to enter.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nCommunity Care Organization independent living youth are unsupervised.\nINVESTIGATION:\nJoann House is an independent living plus program.
