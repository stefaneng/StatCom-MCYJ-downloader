Caseworkers documented phone/video attendance of\nparticipants in MiSACWIS. The agency was advised to document this\ninformation on the FTM 1105 report as well.\n Two foster care files did not have documentation of education for the current\nschool year.

However,\nthe occurrence of each violation has decreased from the 2020 review. The agency\nwill adjust areas from previous CAPs to continue to increase compliance in the\ncoming year.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Annual Assessment dated 7/20/21 was reviewed. The\nassessment was completed by the previous CA, before leaving the agency in August\n2021. The CA assessment noted increased compliance in areas previously\naddressed in CAPs from 2019 and 2020. CAP reviews, team meetings, and regular\nsupervision have assisted the agency in addressing areas of improvement and\nreviewing policy/procedure changes as they occur. As reflected in the assessment\nand discussed while on-site with the new CA, the agency had to adjust over the past\nyear due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Video conferencing, staff working remotely,\n11",
    "and utilizing new technology such as DocuSign has helped the agency continue to\ndo business as needed, while keeping staff and clients safe. In addition, the CA\nreported that a higher-than-normal retention rate over the past year has also helped\nthe agency maintain stability. The CA identified areas of improvement to focus on\nover the next year, which is consistent with areas identified by DCWL in this review.\nInterviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. Both staff reported that supervisors and\nadministration are very supportive. The agency is a great place to work and very\nflexible with their schedules. Staff reported administration cares about their well-\nbeing during the pandemic and reminds staff to have self-care. Staff reported no\nconcerns or areas the agency could improve upon.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\nSeptember 22, 2021\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 23, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n12"
