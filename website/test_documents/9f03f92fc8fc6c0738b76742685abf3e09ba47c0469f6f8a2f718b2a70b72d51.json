    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during\nthis licensing period.\nThe agency has submitted four acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nSIR 2022C0112005 was initiated on 1/13/2022 regarding allegations a staff member\ntook a youth to the store and attempted to hug youth and touch his penis. There was\nnot enough evidence to support the allegations of sexual advances. However, a\nviolation was determined for rule R 400.12206(1) staff qualifications due to staff\nadmitting to taking youth to the store and smoking with youth while in the vehicle. A\nCAP was approved on 5/4/2022 and continues to be implemented at this time.\nSIR 2022C0212011 was initiated on 3/21/2022 due to allegations the agency did not\nprovide known information to foster parents regarding an aggressive and assaultive\nyouth. There was no evidence to support this allegation as the agency verbally\nprovided this information to the foster parents. However, during the course of the\ninvestigation it was determined this information was not provided to the foster\nparents in writing as required in rule R 400.12405 change of placement. A CAP was\napproved on 6/14/2022 and continues to be implemented at this time.\nSIR 2022C0444018 was initiated on 7/12/2022 due to allegations the agency was\nnot utilizing interpreter services for a foster child who is deaf. The investigation\ndetermined the agency was not utilizing interpreter services during all of the foster\nhome visits with the youth despite documentation in the case indicating youth uses\nAmerican Sign Language in order to communicate. A CAP was submitted and is\npending approval.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan in response to the\ninterim inspection completed on 9/27/2021 with a corrective action plan approved on\n11/10/2021. During the review the agency had seven violations. Four citations were\nnoted as repeat violations in the current inspection. During this period under review\nthe agency noted that staff turnover and retention impacted overall compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment reported the agency’s difficulty in meeting requirements during this\nreview period. The Chief Administrator (CA) stated the previous year CAP was\neffective and the agency conducts internal file audits to achieve compliance. The CA\nnoted the file audits have been particularly effective with medical and dental\nrequirements. However, the agency has struggled with turnover, and it has impacted\ncompliance overall.\nThe CA indicated that the agency has seen good results by pairing new staff with\nmentors right away. In addition, the agency has implemented protected time for staff,\n11",
    "updated checklists and in-services. The CA noted the agency has an internal quality\nprocess called QAPI that they utilize as well as quarterly performance reports. The\nCA expressed confidence that several areas will improve over the next review period.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted with four staff via telephone. Staff acknowledge this year\nhas been somewhat challenging due to high turnover. However, they felt confident\nthe agency was taking the appropriate steps to address staffing issues. Staff reported\nsupervisors were available when needed and felt supported. Staff did not report any\nareas of need.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\n____________8/26/2022__________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 26, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n12"
