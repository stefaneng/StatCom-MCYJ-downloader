    "• (d) Current immunizations for each child as required\nby section 5111 of the public health code, 1978 PA\n368, MCL 333.5111. All the following apply:\n• (ii) A copy of a waiver addressed to the\ndepartment that is signed by the parent\nstating immunizations are not being\nadministered due to religious, medical, or\nother reasons is sufficient documentation of\nimmunizations, unless the child is a\ntemporary court ward, a motion is heard, and\norder is entered by the circuit court for the\nchild's case. A waiver must be accompanied\nby a certification by the local health\ndepartment that the parent or parents\nreceived education on the risks of not\nreceiving the vaccines being waived and the\nbenefits of vaccination to the individual and\nthe community as required by section 5111 of\nthe public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL\n333.5111, and R 325.176(12).\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth received immunizations without parental consent.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on February 27,\n2025. They reported no additional information.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FC Supervisor) was interviewed via\nvideo conference on February 19, 2025. Youth A has been in\nMethodist’s program since June 2024. FC Supervisor stated\nYouth A received immunization during his initial medical\nappointment in July 2024. Methodist didn’t have the case when\nYouth A initially came into care. DHS had the case until Youth A\nentered Independent Living (IL) in June 2024 and they were not\ninformed of any issues with parents refusing immunizations and\nYouth A didn’t indicate anything either.\nDuring the video call, FC Supervisor continued to look to her left.\nDuring the interview a voice was heard when discussing\nimmunizations. Chief Administrator (CA) spoke up and stated\nshe was sitting on the other side of the room. She stated this is\nYouth A’s second time in care and he received immunizations\nduring his first time in care. They ran medical passports when he\nfirst came to their agency and saw that he received\nimmunizations, so they weren’t aware of any parental refusal. She\n2",
    "stated Foster Care Worker (FCW) accompanied Youth A to the\nappointment where he received immunizations at his initial\nmedical in July 2024 and he didn’t vocalize any concern with\nreceiving them. He stated he didn’t want the COVID vaccine so\nthat wasn’t administered but that was the only one he objected to.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nFebruary 21, 2025. He stated Youth A is in the agency’s\nIndependent Living Plus program. FCW stated when Youth A\nentered the IL program, he arranged the initial medical in July\n2024. Part of the initial medical appointment for Youth A included\nsome immunizations. He stated Youth A had previously received\nimmunizations but was behind so FCW assumed it was\nacceptable to administer in order for Youth A to be caught up on\nimmunizations. Youth A did not verbalize any objection to the\nimmunizations other than the COVID 19 vaccination, so he was\nnot given that one. Youth A had been removed previously and\nadministered immunizations, so he wasn’t aware biological\nparents objected. He stated after the initial medical appointment,\nFCW spoke with Biological Mother and she advised she did not\nwant Youth A to receive any immunizations. FCW stated he\nexplained to Biological Mother he wasn’t aware she objected to\nimmunizations and that he had received some at the initial\nmedical appointment. FCW stated he is working on obtaining a\nwaiver but that has not been completed yet.\nBiological Mother was interviewed via telephone on February\n27, 2025. Biological Mother stated there was never any discussion\nbetween her and the agency regarding her stance on\nimmunizations. She stated one of her other children mentioned\nreceiving “shots” so she asked all of her children and was told\nthey had also received immunizations. She spoke with FCW and\nexplained she didn’t want Youth A or her other children to receive\nimmunizations. She stated FCW seemed to be confused that he\nwasn’t supposed to do that without parental consent.\nYouth A was interviewed via telephone on March 12, 2025. He\nstated he recalled getting shots in the past but couldn’t recall what\nthey were. He appeared to be somewhat confused by the\nquestions but stated he reported he did not want to get the COVID\n19 vaccine. He stated he was told later after the appointment by\nFCW that Biological Mother did not want him to get\nimmunizations.\nDocuments reviewed:\n3",
    "• MISACWIS case file for Youth A. Lists approximately 24\nimmunizations dating back to 2008 up until 2024. There is not\na waiver uploaded in the case file.\n• Agency immunization policy states:\nNonmedical Waiver: Parents or guardians who object to\nimmunizations for religious or philosophical reasons must\ncontact the local county health department to schedule an\nappointment for the nonmedical waiver education sessions\nand obtain the required certified waiver. For children not\nenrolling in the programs or grades listed above, the\nnonmedical waiver from the previous year is acceptable.\nParent Objection: For children who do not fall into the\ncategories noted in Michigan Administrative Code R\n325.176, but whose parent(s) or legal guardian(s) opposes\nimmunizations for religious or philosophical reasons, a\nwritten, signed, and dated statement documenting the\nparent’s objection to each specific immunization being\nrefused is required. The parental objection statement must\nbe updated annually.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of Youth A’s MISACWIS case file Biological\nMother did not inform the agency of her objection to\nimmunizations and a waiver was not on file prior to Youth A\nreceiving immunizations.\nConsultation\nConsultation was provided for agency to consider updating policy\nand procedures to ask parents if they oppose to their child(ren)\nreceiving immunizations when they begin working with the family\nand document within the case file.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection • (3) An agency shall facilitate in-person contact between\nDescription parents and children except where parental rights have\nbeen terminated or when there is a court determination that\nvisits are detrimental to the child.\n4",
