    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 2/14/22022, Foster Parent A was involved in a serious incident and is being\narrested for felony homicide. Law Enforcement (LE) indicated that there was a\nhistory of domestic violence between Foster Parent A and the other individual; and a\npersonal protection order (PPO) was in place. The foster parent’s renewal report\nindicates the foster parent reports no domestic violence history or current\nrelationship. There is information in the renewal report that there are firearms in the\nhome. There is concern the agency did not adequately assess the foster home.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/18/2022 I reviewed the complaint document which indicated the information\nabove about the serious felony incident, domestic violence, and PPO allegations and\nwhat Foster Parent A’s renewal report indicates. The complaint document further\nindicated:\n An arrest notification was received by the Division of Child Welfare Licensing\n(DCWL) for Foster Parent A indicating Foster Parent A was arrested for\nfelony homicide.\n Per Ennis, Foster Parent A denied being in a relationship.\n Foster Parent A is a state employee for another county. Foster Parent A\nadmitted to using substances while caring for Foster Child B who was placed\nin her home.\n Foster Child B is an Ingham County youth. Foster Child B was in route to\nschool, and not in the home at the time of the shooting.\n Foster Child B’s placement is by way of a borrowed bed with Ennis-Pontiac.\nOn 3/2/2022, I completed an onsite agency visit. I met with Licensee Designee 0,\nLicensing Supervisor 2 and reviewed licensing documentations:\nLicensee Designee 0 and Licensing Supervisor 1 confirmed that Ennis Center for\nChildren-Pontiac was the certifying agency for Foster Parent A; and that the Ingham\nCounty Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was borrowing a bed in\nFoster Parent A’s home for Foster Child B. Foster Child B was placed with Foster\nParent A in July 2021 and Ingham County DHHS has responsibility for monthly foster\ncare worker visits to the foster home, and Foster Child B’s case services. Licensee\nDesignee 0 reported, Ingham County DHHS had not reported any concerns to Ennis\nrelated to Foster Parent A or Child B’s placement.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 reported Ennis would have only had periodic or quarterly\ncontacts with Foster Parent A. These contacts would have consisted of checking to\nsee if there was something Foster Parent A may have needed related to the license.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 reported Ennis’s last contact would have been to complete\nFoster Parent A’s relocation study in January 2022. She, as well as Licensee\nDesignee 0 both verified that Ennis has a special evaluation underway related to the\n3",
    "shooting incident and allegations indicated in the complaint against Foster Parent A.\nBoth administrators denied the agency having prior knowledge of any information\nrelated to domestic violence for Foster Parent A or information related to her being in\na relationship with anyone. Both administrators also acknowledged the special\ncircumstances related to this complaint, given Foster Parent A's relationship with the\nDepartment, and the circumstance of this complaint. Licensing Supervisor 1 reported\nthis complaint is the first special evaluation for Foster Parent A.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 advised that Foster Parent A’s reevaluation was current at the\ntime of this incident. The agency completed the Renewal Reevaluation; and most\nrecently a Relocation Study in January 2022. Licensing Supervisor 1 reported Foster\nParent A would have signed three series of policies, inclusive of a weapon’s policy.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 reported Foster Parent A had reported multiple times, she has\nno significant other, was not in a relationship, and that there was no drug use or\nsubstance issues for her. Licensing Supervisor 1 reported since the complaint\nallegations, the agency discovered (by way of the LE investigation) Foster Parent A\nadmitted to using cocaine the night before the shooting. Licensing Supervisor 1\nadmitted at the time of Ennis’s licensing worker’s January 2022 Relocation Study, the\nlicensing worker did not complete a Children’s Foster Home Rules Compliance\nRecord (CWL-3080) or document where Foster Parent A would keep the guns, that\nFoster Parent A reported having during the foster home’s Renewal Inspection.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 surmised the licensing worker would have had verbal\ndiscussions with the family about the weapons. She advised given the past policy\nsigning by Foster Parent A that Foster Parent A should have been abreast of the\nagency and licensing requirements related to having a weapon in the home.\nLicensing Supervisor 1 and Licensee Designee 0 reported grounds for revocation of\nFoster Parent A’s license seems feasible and is being assessed via the special\nevaluation investigation.\nLicensee Designee 0 reported further via email on 3/11/2022 that Foster Parent A\nnever disclosed having a concealed weapons permit. The guns were initially disclosed\nat the renewal evaluation inspection. The guns were not there at the initial evaluation\ninspection. He provided Foster Parent A signed a weapon’s policy dated 8/2/2021.\nOn 3/2/2022, while onsite, I interviewed Licensing Worker 2. Licensing Worker 2\nreported being employed by Ennis, since 12/2/2019. She completed Foster Parent\nA’s 12/22/2020 Initial Foster Home Evaluation (DCWL-3130); and the foster home’s\n1/7/2021 Relocation Study. Another worker, who is no longer with the agency,\ncompleted the foster home’s Renewal Inspection.\nLicensing Worker 2 reported Foster Parent A informed the agency in December 2021\nthat Foster Parent A was buying a new home; and the foster parent kept the agency\nabreast so that the agency could come out and inspect the new home. Licensing\nWorker 2 reported completing the usual tasks during the Relocation Inspection. She\nreported those tasks consisted of signing a new application; touring the home,\nchecking water temperature, cleaning supply storage, inquiring/checking to see if\n4",
    "there were pets, and inquiring about a significant relationship. Licensing Worker 2\nreported during the Relocation Inspection, Foster Parent A denied having a significant\nrelationship, as was reported in the Initial Licensing Study. Foster Parent A also again\ndenied involvement with drugs or alcohol. Licensing Worker 2 reported she has never\nobserved Foster Parent A to appear under the influence of any substances, other than\nthat Foster Parent A was a cigarette smoker.\nLicensing Worker 2 affirmed Licensing Supervisor 1’s reporting that she did not\ncomplete the CWL-3080 during the Relocation Inspection. She did not know she was\nrequired to do so. She reported Licensing Supervisor 1 knew she was completing the\nRelocation Inspection, but this supervisor was new to licensing also, and the\ninformation they reviewed to assist them on how to go about completing the\nRelocation Inspection did not indicate a need to complete the 3080 document.\nLicensing Worker 2 acknowledged that some items were missed in the Relocation\nInspection because she did not use the CWL-3080. She reported modeling her report\nafter a 2020 example.\nLicensing Worker 2 reported asking Foster Parent A about the three guns, which\nFoster Parent A reported being in the home during the Renewal Inspection Report.\nFoster Parent A reported the guns were still stored at the home she moved from.\nFoster Parent A had not fully moved all her items into the home and anticipated doing\nso later the day of Licensing worker 2’s home visit, or the next day. Licensing Worker\n2 did not check to see if the guns, sword, and rifle were in the home. Foster Parent A\nreported she was taking those items to her grandmother’s home until she was able to\nput a lock on her bedroom door. Foster Parent A also reported needing to obtain a\nlock box for medication storage.\nLicensing Worker 2 did not go back out to the home to check/assess whether the\nstated weapons were back in the home; and if so, whether they were properly stored,\nper rule. She did not report whether she inquired about a gun or CCW (Carrying\nConcealed Weapon) license for Foster Parent A. Licensing Worker 2 reported as far\nas she knew the guns were at Foster Parent A’s grandmother’s home. She thought\nthis, because at the time of the home visit to Foster Parent A’s home related to the\nagency’s special evaluation for this shotting incident, Foster Parent A still did not have\na lock on her bedroom door. Licensing Worker 2 reported she discovered (via the\npolice report pertaining to the shooting Foster Parent A was involved in), her belief\nwas in error, because apparently at least one gun was in the home, which was used\nby the Foster Parent A in the shooting incident. Licensing Worker 2 expressed\ndistress over not checking all items during the Relocation Inspection, but logically\nknows even if she had, and the documentation was in the Relocation Study, such\ncould not have prevented the shooting Foster Parent A is accused of.\n5",
    "Reviewed:\nFoster Parent A’s Licensing documents and MISACWIS file which showed:\n Foster Parent A was licensed by Ennis Center for Children on 3/19/2021.\n Foster Parent A’s Initial Foster/Adoption Home Evaluation (CWL-3130) was\ndated 12/22/2020, and documented that Foster Parent A:\n Had provided relative care/placement to her 15-year-old sister prior to\nlicensure (5/10/2019-8/5/2020).\n Resided in her home with her 37-year-old, younger brother at the time of\nthe original licensing evaluation.\n Reported no weapons were stored in the home and medication was\nsecured in a locked box.\n Reported no childhood abuse or victimization.

She denied a history of\nalcohol abuse.\n Was found in compliance with all licensing rules and was approved for two\nchildren, cross racial, age 12 to 18.\n Foster Parent A’s Foster Home Reevaluation (CWL-4004) for 3/19/2021-\n9/18/2021, completed 8/20/2021, which indicated:\n A foster home visit by the worker on 8/2/2021 and 8/18/2021.\n Foster Parent A’s brother moved out the foster home during the licensing\nperiod.\n Foster Parent A reported no history of separations or domestic violence;\nand that she is not currently in a relationship.\n Two handguns, one rifle, and a small sword were reported in the home.\nThe handguns were stored in a locked metal case; the rifle was trigger\nlocked; and the sword was kept on a high shelf in Foster Parent A’s\nbedroom closet. The ammunition was kept separately; the key was kept\non Foster Parent A’s person. The worker assessed the weapons and\nammunition were properly stored and not accessible to children in the\nhome.\n Two children were placed in the home during the reevaluation.\n No reported changes in Foster Parent A’s physical, mental, emotional\nhealth or substance use during this licensure period.\n Foster Parent A’s medications were reported as Alprazolam(0.05mg) for\nanxiety; Modafinil(200mg) for narcolepsy; Fusion Plus for probiotics, and a\nCPAP machine, used every night for sleep apnea.

This document contained a summary of the police’s interview with\nFoster Parent A and her attorney related to events prior and leading to the\nshooting incident. The Narrative document indicated information Foster Parent A\nreported which was contradictory to what she had reported to the Ennis during\nher initial, renewal and relocation foster home evaluations about being in a\nrelationship, current or past history of domestic violence, any alcohol abuse or\ndrug use or abuse; or having guns at the new location. Foster Parent A reported:\n A past and current relationship with Person X prior to the shooting. This\nrelationship began when she was age 15; and had ended because of\n“domestic violence”. She reconnected with Person X three years ago.\n Person X’s and her living arrangement in December was that he stayed at\nher house for a week or two but lived elsewhere.\n She obtained a PPO (Person Protection Order) against Person X in June\nor July of last year. Person X had grabbed, choked and threatened to kill\nher and her family, as well as sent her threatening text messages.\nAdditionally, Person X had been “too aggressive” to her a time in\nDecember; and she contacted the police. She reported Person X had\n“jumped on her several times”.\n The night before the shooting, she and Person X were drinking and both\nsnorted cocaine. This was at her house in the basement. Person X was\n7",
    "intoxicated, and she had a “little buzz”. She also reported, “they were\nhigh”.\n The morning of the shooting, a domestic violence incident occurred\nbetween she and Person X. This incident led to her obtaining: keys from a\nsafe from underneath her mattress; a gun and shooting Person X at least\nonce.\n Having the gun (which she thought was a Ruger or Luger 9MM) for about\na year. It is the gun she carries if she wants to carry. The gun was loaded\nwhen she grabbed it from the safe, it is registered to her. She reported\nhaving other registered guns and did not have any guns that were not\nregistered to her. She reported having a CPL (Concealed Pistol License).\n Ennis Children for Children’s Weapon’s Agreement signed by Foster Parent A\nand an agency staff person on 8/1/2021 and 8/2/2021 respectively. The\nAgreement showed:\n The box for having weapons in the home was checked.\n Handgun and rifle was handwritten in the area of that indicated line.\n Ennis requires foster parents/adoptive parents who have ownership of a\nweapon to show they have a registered permit for the weapon and a\nMichigan concealed Pistol License. Additionally, that the foster\nparent/adoptive parent provide a copy of the permit and license to the\nlicensing worker.\n A copy of such a permit or license was not documented in the evaluation\nor MISACWIS for Foster Parent A.\n8",

Nor showed that a copy\nof the guns’ registrations and or licenses were obtained from the\nfoster parent.\nLicensing Worker 2 reported Foster Parent A had not completely\nmoved into the new home when Licensing Worker 2 made the\nhome visit for the relocation inspection. Licensing Worker 2 did\nnot complete another home visit to inspect whether any or all of\nthe weapons reported as being in the home during the Renewal\nInspection were in the new home and stored securely.\nAdditionally, the Relocation Study does not document whether\nFoster Parent A’s relationship status changed since the last\nevaluation. Nor was it documented in the report that was\nexplored as reported by the worker.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n9",
