    "with the department’s investigation, inspection, and examination\nby doing all of the following:\n(c) Providing accurate and truthful information to the department,\nand encouraging witnesses, such as staff and household\nmembers, to provide accurate and truthful information to the\ndepartment.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency terminated a staff member after they discovered the\nstaff member falsified files and documented home visits that never\nactually occurred.\nInvestigation Interviews\nChief Administrator was interviewed by phone on 11/21/2024.\nShe reported someone from Branch County DHHS informed\nFoster Care Supervisor that Foster Care Worker had not been\nvisiting with Youth A in the foster home. It was reported the last\nvisit that took place was a brief interaction between Foster Care\nWorker and Youth A in Youth A’s therapist’s parking lot; however,\nFoster Care Worker documented in the case record the visit took\nplace in the foster home. This resulted in Foster Care Supervisor\nand Foster Care Worker reviewing the case records of youths on\nFoster Care Worker’s caseload and contacting foster parents to\nverify if documented visits in their homes took place. Chief\nAdministrator stated there were multiple visits documented in case\nrecords and for which Youth A claimed mileage that foster parents\nreported did not occur. Chief Administrator stated Foster Care\nWorker’s employment has been terminated.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed by phone on\n11/21/2024. She reported Foster Care Worker worked at the\nagency for a little over a year. Foster Care Supervisor was made\naware by staff at Branch County DHHS that Foster Care Worker\nconducted a visit with Youth A in Youth A’s therapist’s parking lot\nand not in the foster home in October of 2024. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated Foster Care Worker had documented in the\ncase record that visit took place in the home. Chief Administrator\ncalled Youth A’s foster parents who confirmed the visit did take\nplace in a parking lot and implied it has happened before. Since\nthat time, Foster Care Supervisor and Chief Administrator have\ncontacted the foster parents for all of the youths on Foster Care\nWorker’s caseload and they have all reported not having seen\nFoster Care Worker in a while and there have been months when\nvisits in their home did not occur, but none of them gave specifics.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated Foster Care Worker would provide\nher with dates she had seen youths during every supervision held.\n2",
    "Foster Care Worker would then document those visits in the\nyouths’ case records and request mileage for those home visits.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated none of the foster parents told her\nFoster Care Worker wasn’t conducting monthly visits until Foster\nCare Supervisor and Chief Administrator reached out to them.\nMDHHS Foster Care Supervisor was interviewed via video\nconferencing on 12/19/2024. She reported being told by the\nMDHHS staff monitoring the case, MDHHS Foster Care Worker,\nmonthly visits with Youth A in her foster home were not\ndocumented for two consecutive months. MDHHS Supervisor\nreported there were multiple meetings with Foster Care Worker\nand Foster Care Supervisor about the case as it appeared Foster\nCare Worker did not like Youth A’s foster parents and was not\nworking well with them. Due to the missing face to face contacts,\nMDHHS Foster Care Supervisor asked Foster Care Supervisor to\nconduct a visit with Youth A, in her foster home, in October of\n2024. MDHHS Foster Care Supervisor stated the case has been\nreturned to MDHHS for direct care and MDHHS Foster Care\nWorker is now assigned to the case.\nMDHHS Foster Care Worker was interviewed by phone on\n12/19/2024. She reported having been assigned as the monitor on\nthe case prior to having been assigned as the direct care worker.\nShe stated in September she noticed there were no face to face\nwith the youth in the foster home entered into the case record for\nthe month. MDHHS Worker spoke to Youth A’s foster parent who\nreported only having seen Foster Care Worker for approximately 3\nminutes in a parking lot on September 24, 2024. She stated\nFoster Care Worker was there with another worker and youth and\nonly said “hi” to Youth A when she saw her in the parking lot. No\nother visits occurred with Youth A that month.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n• The following case contacts were entered by Foster Care\nWorker in Youth A’s case record:\n6/27/2024 – Announced visit in foster home\n7/31/2024 Face to Face visit with youth\n8/29/2024 – Visit in foster home\n9/10/2024 - Worker at foster home for 1-1.5 hours\n9/24/2024 - Draft contact documenting face to face at foster home\nfor 1-1.5 hours\n10/16/2024 face to face with family at foster home 1-1.5 hours\n• Text message between MDHHS Foster Care Worker and\nYouth A’s foster parent in which MDHHS Foster Care\nWorker asked if Foster Care Worker visited the foster home\n3",
    "in September. Youth A’s foster parent responded “no”\nadding Foster Care Worker was supposed to attend Youth\nA's medication review in September but did not. Youth A’s\nFoster Parent saw Foster Care Worker in the parking lot\nafter the appointment. Foster Care Worker told her she was\nrunning late and spoke with Youth A for approximately 3\nminutes in the parking lot. No visit to the foster home was\nmade in September.\nAnalysis A violation is established due to Youth A’s case record including\ninformation that is not truthful or accurate as visits with a youth in\nher foster home that did not occur are documented to have\noccurred.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJanuary 3, 2025\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 10, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
