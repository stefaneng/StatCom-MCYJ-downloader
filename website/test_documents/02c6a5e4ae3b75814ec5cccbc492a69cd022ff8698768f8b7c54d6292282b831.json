    "summary": "An anonymous complaint alleged that a youth at the Calumet Center could pop his bedroom lock and exit, creating safety concerns. The state investigation involved multiple interviews and document reviews, finding no evidence to support the lock-popping claim, though it confirmed the youth had recent aggressive incidents resulting in property damage. Based on witness statements, facility policies, and a recent locksmith inspection showing minor maintenance, the investigator concluded the violation was not established, effectively clearing the facility of the specific allegation.",
