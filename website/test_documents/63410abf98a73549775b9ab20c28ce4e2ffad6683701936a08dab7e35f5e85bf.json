IL Youth said she gets around well and does not crawl and\nis able to use her walker when walking. She said her wheelchair\nwas broken but the agency is looking into fixing it.

She\nreported the home is staffed and someone is there most of the\ntime. IL Youth reported she only gets $80.00 dollars in food\nstamps, and this is not enough. IL youth reported that the person\nwho was in the program using substance is no longer in the\nprogram. She said there is no illegal substances being used in\nthe house now.

The IL Director explained that the front of\nthe house has stairs. IL Youth is partially mobile and is able to\nuse the railing to get herself up and down the stairs. She said the\nagency tried to get a ramp for IL Youth when she first moved into\nthe home, but the stairs were too steep, and the ramp was not\nsafe for wheelchair use due to the angle. She said the agency\ntried to go another route to get a ramp, but due to liability, the\ncompany, the agency asked said no. She reported in addition, the\nagency is renting the house, so the agency needed the landlord\napproval for the agency to take the porch down.

She\nreported IL Youth has a room on the first floor which gives her\naccess to the kitchen, bathroom, staff office, library, and\ngathered/living room. She said IL Youth sometimes goes upstairs\nto the second floor but, since the agency put in the rule that\nyouths may not be in each other’s rooms, there is no longer a\nreason for IL Youth to go upstairs as there are only other youths’\nrooms and bathrooms on the second floor.
