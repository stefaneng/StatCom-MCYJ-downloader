ILY A said it all started when he\nwas in the kitchen late afternoon cooking on 2/18/25, and he\nasked Staff 1 for a knife. He said Staff 1 grabbed a kitchen knife\nand threatened him with it. He said Staff 1 did not touch him with\nthe knife. He said he was not sure why Staff 1 threatened him\nand that he did nothing to provoke Staff 1 and all he did was ask\nStaff 1 for a knife.

He reported he\nwas in the building the night the incident occurred, and Staff 1 was\non staff. ILY B said food was thrown away because flies were in\nthe kitchen and got into ILY A food because the food was not\ncovered. ILY B reported all five of the youths were involved in the\nincident because they eat late at night. ILY B reported the youth\nalways make a mess in the kitchen and they do not clean up after\nthemselves. ILY B reported the youth had already eaten once and\nwas going to eat again.

He reported all knifes are\nlocked up and that staff never used any knife to threaten youths.\n4",
    "ILY B ended the interview by stating the youths wanted to kill Staff\n1. He said they did not respect Staff 1 because he gave the all\nyouths in the program directions. ILY B reported the youths would\nthrow trash cans at staff members if they did not like a direction\ngiven to them, and the youths would always travel in groups and\nwould approach any situation with four or five youth to fight each\nother or staff. He said if ILY A had a problem, it became the other\nyouth’s problem as well because ILY A was the leader.\nIndependent Living Youth C (ILY C) was interviewed on\n2/26/25, via telephone with MDHHS Worker. He reported there\nis always food in the house. He said the youths get a lot of food\nthat lasts for a week. He said staff take them to get food weekly.\nHe said there are no issues of staff not wanting to take them to the\nstores. ILY C reported the youths would complain there was no\nfood in the house, and they would then call the police to make a\ncomplaint. ILY C said staff would take them to the stores but as\nsoon as they get into the stores, they would make a scene\namongst themselves.\nILY C said the only food that was thrown out was food that had\nbeen left out for hours because it was “nasty”. He said food that\nhad been left out had gnats flying over it and the food did not have\nany lids covering the food. He reported he came downstairs on\nthe day of the incident, and he saw Staff 1 throw the food out. He\nsaid gnats were flying over the food.

He reported he understood that the\nyouths grew up in an intimidating environment and feels they\nalways had to work in a group to feel safe and to protect\nthemselves. He reported however, it’s the youths who are always\nthreatening each other in the house as well as staff members. He\nreported at no time has he ever witnessed Staff 1 or any of the\nstaff members threaten any youth with a knife.\nIL Youth D (ILY D) was interviewed on 3/10/25, via telephone\nand face-to-face with MDHHS Worker and an interpreter. ILY\nD is an unaccompanied refugee minor court ward placed in the\ncare and custody of Bethany Christian Services through MDHHS.\nHe reported the youth in the program could use the kitchen\n5",
    "anytime during the day but at nighttime the youth could only cook\nduring certain times, and they had to be finished by midnight. He\nreported the youths were in charge of cleaning the kitchen after\nthey finished cooking. He said sometimes the youths would clean\nthe kitchen and sometimes they would not clean the kitchen, and it\nwould get dirty. He reported if staff asked them to clean the\nkitchen, they would decide if they wanted to clean it or not. Most\ntimes, they would not clean it if staff asked them too. ILY D said\nhe only knew of the incident regarding a knife by hearing it from\nILY A. He said he did not witness this incident. ILY D said Staff 1\ndid tell them to clean the kitchen up before he threw out the food.\nHe said no bugs was in the kitchen. ILY D said ILY A did not\nshare the video with him but that he learned that ILY A had a\nvideo of Staff 1 talking to him in a bad way.

He reported trash was everywhere in the house. He\nsaid the youth are supposed to clean but he started cleaning the\nhouse around 9:30pm. He said ILY A and others are usually\nfinished eating around 8:PM or 9:00PM. Staff 1 said he went into\nthe kitchen and noticed a skillet on the stove with old rice and\nsome kind of old meat. He said the food had been eaten earlier\nthat day and gnats were flying everywhere. He said he had\nobserved ILY A in the kitchen earlier, so he went to his room and\ntranslated through his phone and asked ILY A to come downstairs\nwith him. He said ILY A said no. Staff 1 said he wanted to show\nILY A the gnats that was flying around the food and to let him\nknow that he was throwing the food out. He said afterwards, he\nwent back to the kitchen and dumped the food out, cleaned the\nkitchen and left his shift for that day. He said he does not know\nwhich one of the youths went to the kitchen after he left but, the\nnext day when he came to work, he was informed that he threw\nthe youths food out on purpose and that a grievance was filed on\nhim.

He reported he would never point a knife at any of the\nyouths.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed on 2/26/25, with\nMDHHS Worker. He reported on 2/13/25 it was alleged the\nyouths were making vegetable soup in the kitchen. They were\nasked by Staff 1 to clean the vegetables out of the sink, and they\nrefused to do so. Staff 1 responded by throwing their pot of soup\nin the trash before they had a chance to eat it. PM reported ILY A\nreported on 2/19/2025, that Staff 1 made inappropriate and\nthreatening comments to him when he confronted Staff 1 for\nthrowing away their soup. PM reported he watched the video\ntaping of the incident and afterwards, he sent the video clippings\nto Director of Quality and Compliance.\nPM provided the agency a video recording to watch of the incident\nto MDHHS Worker and this Consultant.\nStaff 2 was interviewed on 3/11/25, via telephone with MDHHS\nWorker. She reported she was working on the day of the incident\nwith Staff 1. She reported she went to the kitchen because the\nsink was clogged, and she then went upstairs to ILY A room to\nask him to go downstairs and unclog the sink. She reported lots\nof water was over the sink because the youths were pouring\ngrease down the sink. She said she knew the last person in the\nkitchen cooking was ILY A. She said she was unaware of the\nfood being thrown out and that ILY A did not discuss this with her,\nnor did he go downstairs to unclog the sink. She said he told her\nthat was her job. Staff 2 reported the youths ate all day and\ncooked 4 times per day, and they never cleaned up after\nthemselves. She said the youths would tell staff they don't clean\nup. The youths would go in and cook and leave the kitchen a\nmess.\nStaff 2 reported she is not aware of Staff 1 ever confronting the\nyouths. She has never noticed Staff 1 getting irritated with the\nyouths for not cleaning up. Staff 2 reported she is not aware of\nany time the youths didn't have any food in the house and only ate\n7",
    "fruit. Staff 2 replied, \"They always had food” and foster care\nalways ensures they have food. Staff 2 reported foster care will do\nonline orders for the youths and she will pick up the order from\nWalmart.\nStaff 2 confirmed staff lock up the cooking knives. She said there\nwere no issues with the youths not bringing the knives back when\nthey were done. She said she has never been threatened with a\nknife and has never heard of any issues with a knife.\nStaff 3 was interviewed on 3/14/25, via telephone with MDHHS\nWorker. She reported she came into work at 11:00pm the night\nof the first incident involving the food being thrown out by Staff 1.\nShe said she came in for 3rd shift to the youths wanting to see the\ncamera footage. She reported she did not allow the youths to view\nthe footage. She said she viewed the footage and saw Staff 1\nthrowing the youths dinner away. Staff 3 said she believes the\nyouths were waiting for the food to cool down, which she noted is\nnot uncommon for their culture. Staff 3 reported the youths were\nso upset they hung around the office from 11:00pm-4:00am\nasking to watch the video footage. She said the youth still had\naccess to food but were upset because they had already prepared\nfood to eat. She reported she knows there were dirty dishes in the\nsink when she arrived. She was told by Staff 1 that he told the\nyouths to clean up prior to throwing the food away, but she never\nsaw footage supporting this claim. Staff 3 reported she did not\nhear any audio regarding Staff 1 asking the youths to clean up.\nShe reported Staff 1 also indicated there were bugs in the food,\nbut she personally cleaned the kitchen the day prior, so the food\nwould not have been on the stove since the night prior. She\nreported she saw the food being prepared by ILY A via watching\nthe video footage. Staff 3 said she did not see Staff 1 asking the\nyouths to clean up, but one of the youths admitted to her that Staff\n1 asked them to clean up and they admitted they refused. Staff 3\nreported when she arrived at 11:00pm, she could smell that food\nhad been cooked, so Staff 1 should have known the food was\nprepared recently.\nStaff 3 reported the youths typically would put their dirty dishes in\nthe sink, but didn't always complete the cleaning process. She\nreported when the youths were told to clean, the youths would\nsay, \"You clean it.\" She said none of them said this to her, but\nshe heard this was the common response to other staff. She also\ndirectly heard a youth say this to another staff when they asked\nthe youth to clean.\n8",
    "Staff 3 reported ILY A wanted a knife and did not want to ask Staff\n1. ILY A referenced his picture and said, \"This man is a bad, bad\nman, and we do not want to talk to him.\" In response, since Staff 1\nwas in the staff office where the knives were, Staff 3 said she\nwalked with ILY A to the office and asked Staff 1 for a knife. Staff\n1 gave the cooking knife to Staff 3 who handed the knife to ILY A.\nILY A held the knife and pointed it in Staff 1's direction and said\nsomething indistinguishable. Staff 3 reported it happened so\nquickly, she cannot recall details and does not remember exactly\nhow the knife was pointed. She said she is confident whatever ILY\nA said was directed at Staff 1.\nStaff 3 summed up her interview by stating, she worked with Staff\n1 at another Holy Cross location, and she has never heard of any\nissues with his performance or the way he treats the youths. She\nsaid Staff 1 does his job well, so she was really surprised by the\nincident of him throwing the food away.\nDirector of Quality & Compliance was interviewed on 3/27/25,\nvia phone with MDHHS Worker. She reported she was going to\ndo an investigation when he threw away the youth’s soup to see\nwhy and what happened because she viewed the video, the\nyouths complained about it, rightfully so, and in her opinion Staff 1\nescalated the youths. She reported Staff 1 was on a performance\nimprovement plan (PIP) related to an incident in the past\nregarding escalating behavior of youths with how Staff 1 has\nresponded to situations which is what happened in this situation.\nDirector of Human Resources was contacted via email on\n3/27/25. She provided detailed information of Staff 1’s personnel\nfile. This information will be discussed in documents reviewed\nsection.\nALLEGATION 2:\nAll staff and youths were interviewed by MDHHS Worker and this\nConsultant. It is noted that the youths were interviewed with an\ninterpreter.\nFCW reported she received a video recording from ILY A on\n2/19/25, around 3:00am. She reported ILY A had recorded a\nvideo of Staff 1 using threatening and inappropriate language\ntowards ILY A. She said when she heard the statements on the\nrecorder, she acted accordingly, filed a complaint and notified her\nadministration. FCW reported she later talked with ILY A about\nthe recording, and he told her that he wanted to get this staff on\nvideo recording because he felt other staff would not believe him.\n9",
    "FCW said ILY A reported this was an isolated incident and this\ntype of behavior from staff members does not usually occur.\nILY A reported that he does not know the staff member name, but\nhe refers to him as “Bro.” He reported he was still very angry at\nthe staff for throwing his food away. ILY A said it all started when\nhe was in the kitchen late afternoon cooking on 2/18/25, and he\nasked Staff 1 for a knife. He said Staff 1 grabbed a kitchen knife\nand threatened him with it. He said Staff 1 did not touch him with\nthe knife. He said he was not sure why Staff 1 threatened him\nand that he did nothing to provoke Staff 1 and all he did was ask\nStaff 1 for a knife. He said Staff 1 told him he would kill him. He\nsaid he left the kitchen because he wanted to get Staff 1 on tape.\nHe said he went to his room, got his phone, went to the staff office\nbecause he wanted to videotape the conversation between him\nand Staff 1. ILY A said there were no witnesses to this incident in\nthe kitchen.\nILY A presented his phone to MDHHS Worker, this Consultant\nand FCW. This video recording was also viewed on camera at the\nagency by the MDHHS Worker and this Consultant. It can be\nheard ILY A state to Staff 1, repeat what you said to me. Staff 1\nstated, “you wanna play with me? Don’t play with me, get the fuck\nout of here before I kill your ass, I will slice your shit, stop playing\nwith me, don’t ever threaten me, I never did anything to your\nmotherfucking ass.” ILY A was asked if there were any other\nincidents at Holy Cross that made him feel unsafe or\nuncomfortable. ILY A said no, that was all.\nStaff 1 reported he did not know where the knife came from and\nthat he did not have a knife threatening ILY A. He reported that all\nknifes are secure in the staff office. He said he is not sure if the\nyouth in the program have knifes because staff does not search\nthe youths or their bedrooms. He reported on this particular day\nILY A ask him for a knife, he was busy and that he put his hand up\nto ask ILY A to wait a minute. He said ILY A went and got Staff 3.\nHe said Staff 3 got the knife and gave it to ILY A. He reported\nwhen ILY A got the knife, he pointed the knife at Staff 3 and said,\n“Bitch I will get you.” He said he asked Staff 3 what was that all\nabout and Staff 3 said she did not know. Staff 1 reported ten or\nfifteen minutes went by, he went to the kitchen to throw away\ntrash and ILY A pointed the knife at him, (Staff 1) and was “Trash\ntalking and being disrespecting towards him.”. He reported he\ncould not remember his exact words he made towards ILY A but\nhe does not remember using cuss words towards ILY A. MDHHS\nWorker repeated what was heard on ILY A’s telephone that was\n10",
    "said by Staff 1. Staff 1 denied swearing at ILY A stating he could\nnot recall what he said and that ILY A “was out to get him.” Staff 1\nsaid he did not have anything against the youths and after the\naltercation, he tried to apologize and make peace with ILY A.\nStaff 1 reported all of the staff tried to get along with the youths\nbut that they all followed ILY A who was the leader of the group\nand whatever he said or did, the other four youths followed his\ndirections, and it was always negative.\nStaff 1 reported and admitted that he allowed his frustration to get\nthe better of him. He continued by stating he has worked for the\nagency for four years, been very faithful and now his career is\nruined. He said he has had no altercations with youths or in any\nway tried to hurt a youth.\nDirector of Quality & Compliance was interviewed on 3/27/25,\nvia phone with MDHHS Worker. She reported she had her\ninterviews arranged for the investigation but she received the\nemail regarding the recording the youths sent their foster care\nworker, listened to the audio of the incident, and decided not to\ninterview all those that she planned to interview because the\nrecommendation was to terminate him as he clearly violated the\nagency policy related to Participant Safety and Well Being that is\nproved by the audio recording. She reported she will work with\nthe Human Resource Director to identify additional information\nregarding Staff 1’s behaviors with youths in the past.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\n• Agency camera video of the incident between ILY A and\nStaff 1 that occurred on 2/18/25. The video did not show\nStaff 1 with a knife pointing it towards Staff 1. The video\ndid show Staff 1 entering the kitchen, throwing food away.\nThe video did not show any files or gnats circling around\nthe food. There were several agency video clippings\nwatched of the incident. The agency video recording did not\nhave sound. The agency video did not show any physical\ncontact between ILY A and Staff 1. A summary of the\nagency video clippings is as following:\nClippings 1 & 2 the video at 22:38:19 show ILY A prepping\nfood in the kitchen. Staff 1 walks into the kitchen, stands at\nthe counter where ILY A is prepping food and is saying\nsomething to ILY A until 22:38:29, Staff 1 walks out and ILY\nA remains in the kitchen. At 22:38:22 Staff 1 walks out of\nthe kitchen and goes into the staff office.\nClippings 3 & 4. 22:39:06 ILY A exits the kitchen area and\napproaches the staff office in the dining room area. ILY A is\n11",
    "holding the butcher knife, he was using in the kitchen in his\nright hand, and his hand is down next to his side while\ntalking to Staff 1. While ILY A is talking to Staff 1, he moves\nhis left hand to express his feelings, but his right hand\nremains by his side. It does not appear he ever lifts the\nknife and point it toward Staff 1. ILY A walks away from\nthe office and back into the kitchen at 22:40:00. At\n22:28:57 Staff 2 gives a cutting knife with a blue handle to\nILY A. ILY D is with ILY A when ILY A is given the knife.\nILY B is sorting through his groceries in the dining area\nwhile the knife is given to ILY A.\nClippings 5 & 6. 22:47:19 Staff 2 walks into the\ndoorway of the kitchen and back out. 22:51:00 Staff 1\nwalks into the kitchen and immediately to the\nstove where there is a pot. He empties the contents of the\npot in the sink.\n22:48:03 Staff 2 walks upstairs where the youth's\nbedrooms are. She knocks on one door, but after no\nanswer, knocks on another door (ILY A's). Staff 2\nhas her phone out and when the door is answered, she\nshows the phone to whoever is at the door (unknown which\nyouth she's talking to due to the camera angle).
