TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not offered technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\nDCWL Analyst report\nThe DCWL analyst between the dates of 10/23/18 and 11/2/18 visited three foster\nhomes and one unlicensed relative home. The analyst interviewed four foster parents,\ntwo unlicensed relative providers, six children and three birth parents. The following\nconcerns were identified by the analyst during these visits.\nSafety and concern alert #1\n1.There are 7 children under the age of 18 in the home. Is there a variance in place for\nthe number of children in the home that discusses how this number of children are\nsafe?\n2. One birth parent does not feel supported by the assigned worker. The birth parent\nfeels the worker is no longer working towards reunification.\n3. One birth parent is not involved in medical decisions and decisions about her\nchildren's physical appearance.\n4. One birth parent is not notified of appointments for her children.\nCPA resolution\n1.A PER was verbally approved by the director on 5/21/18 at 5:15 pm as this was an\nafter-hours removal situation. The subsequent PER was entered in the system and\nsupports the reasons why this met the wellbeing of these children. Specifically, it would\nkeep the children together. It was closer to the parents, the FC family has strong\ncommunity ties with a lot of supports, the FC mom is an Early Head Start teacher with a\ndegree in Child Development and the FC father has community involvement with\nchildren in coaching sports. They have significant knowledge on child development and\nbehavior. (PER screen shot are attached.)\n2. The birth mother has made minimal progress and has been advised by the\ndepartment that a goal change is recommended, and a petition will be filed. This\ndecision is in conjunction with other service providers working with the family.\nRegardless of this the department is continuing to work with her and provide ongoing\nservices. The birth mother participates in baby court which is more intensive than a\nregular FC case.\n6",
    "3. The birth mother is advised of her children’s medical needs and involved in decisions.\nUploaded in the documents section are releases signed by the birth mother. Including a\nrelease signed through listening ear dated 12/13/18. The birth mother was aware of the\nrequest for tonsillectomy and signed the consent for the procedure 10/4/18. This is\nuploaded in MiSACWIS.\n4. The birth mother is advised regularly of her children’s appointments through text\nmessages. The most recent one notified her of the rescheduled thyroid appointment set\nfor 12/12/18 at 3:30. As indicated above she has been asked for consent on multiple\noccasions and informed of the appointments.\nSafety and concern alert #2\n1. Foster parents are not notified regularly of training opportunities.\n2. Foster home has had one unannounced home visit in a year. The foster home does\nnot receive quarterly unannounced home visits.\n3. One child in the home is exhibiting aggressive behaviors in school and may need\nspecial educational services.\n4. One birth parent has not had a case worker visit to their home or where they are\nliving, during the year-long foster care case.\nCPA resolution\n1.The CPA identified that this FC parent had inadvertently been left off the email group\nfor training notifications. We contacted her, apologized for the error and have since put\nher on and she is in the communication loop. We also cross checked the other foster\nparent emails as a result to assure everyone is getting the training information that is\nsent out monthly.\n2. Documented unannounced visits in MiSACWIS occurred on 2/14/18 and 5/22/18.\n3. Foster care worker documented in the education performance section regarding this\ntopic. The child was displaying behavior problems in school but is now reported to be\ndoing much better. His behaviors are graded on a color scale, the child is receiving\ngood colors every day now.\n4. Visits are documented in MiSACWIS occurring at the mother’s residence on\n12/14/17, 2/22/18, 3/30/18, 4/30/18, 6/28/18, and 7/24/18. After July the mother\nreported to be homeless and couch surfing.\nSafety and concern alert # 3\nNo concerns\nSafety and concern alert # 4\n1.The family has not participated in a family team meeting.\n7",
    "CPA resolution\n1.It is documented in MiSACWIS that parent participated in an FTM on 8/7/18.\nHowever, the form is not uploaded in the system to verify signatures and worker at the\ntime no longer works for this agency for clarification. The relative caregivers will be\ninvited to the next one.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted an acceptable corrective action plan for the violations\nfound in the renewal inspection. The agency’s compliance with the 2018 corrective\naction plan is detailed below under the 2018 renewal inspection.\n2/9/18 Renewal Inspection\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(8) An agency shall complete a reevaluation and shall make\na licensing recommendation to the department at least 15\ncalendar days before the expiration date of the foster home\nlicense.\nTwo of six reevaluations reviewed were not completed 15 days\nbefore the expiration of the license.

In one\nrecord an unannounced visit was not completed during one service plan period. In one\nrecord an unannounced visit was not completed during two service plan periods. This is\na repeat violation from the last two inspections.\nThis interim review found that in two of thirteen service plans the required unannounced\nvisit was not conducted.\nDHHS Policy FOM 722-08C Foster care parent agency treatment plan\nFor both ISP and USP the PATP must be signed by the worker, supervisor, parents,\nfoster parents and children 14 years and older.\nThis renewal inspection eight records were reviewed.
