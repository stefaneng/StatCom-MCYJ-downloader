    "(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff scream and yell at the residents.\nInvestigation I reviewed intake dated 08/23/2023. It states that evening and\nnight staff are screaming at and telling youth to shut up making\nthem feel sad. Complainant reports no other additional\ninformation to the allegations.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite on 08/28/2023. He reports Staff\nPerson 1 often telling the residents, “If you’re not going to shut up”\nand sounds harsh when she addresses the group. He reports\nrecently another unknown resident being in the wrong for\nsomething and that Staff Person 1 was not supportive and\nappeared to instigate the resident and group. Youth A states\nYouth A has not outwardly sworn at the residents. Youth A\nreports that he often gets a headache when in the presence of\nStaff Person 1 and notes that Staff Person 1 is newer. Youth A\ndoes not report any other staff as yelling at them.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite on 08/28/2023. He reports Staff\nPerson 1 as being low-tempered meaning that she is quick to\nanger. He reports Staff Person 1 has participated in group with\nhim and others and that she often speaks sternly and does yell at\nthem though does not use profanity with them. Youth B reports\nStaff Person 1 appears to instigate set up other residents during\ngroup which he states is counterproductive. Youth B does not\nreport any other staff as yelling at them.\nI interviewed Youth C onsite on 08/28/2023. He reports Staff\nPerson 1 is respectful of the residents though reports she often\nuses a loud voice when residents are not following directives. He\nreports her loud direct voice doesn’t help the group as it tends to\nonly anger other residents including himself.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 via telephone on 09/01/2023. She\nreports being employed by the facility since 04/2023 and attended\norientation with no disciplinary actions. She recalls Youth A\nrecently mentioning that he was “sick and tired” of staff yelling and\nnotes that staff must be careful speaking with youth who have\nmental health issues. Staff Person 1 reports that she always\n2",
    "speaks mildly with the residents and denies saying “Shut up”\nthough has come close to it and goes on to report that she “Keeps\nthings real” with the residents. Staff Person 1 reports not\nobserving any staff yelling at the residents. Upon conclusion of\nthe interview Staff Person 1 is noted as questioning how Chief\nAdministrator could see or hear anything stating that she was\nupstairs. During the interview that Staff Person 1 spoke in a quick\nand erratic manner with fluctuating vocal patterns.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator onsite on 08/28/2023. She\nreports Staff Person 1 being a newer staff being hired on\n04/24/2023 and receiving orientation on the same day. She\nrecalls one evening hearing a harsh sounding voice from her\nsecond-floor office and walking downstairs to see what was\noccurring. She reports Staff Person 1 was present and engaging\nin programming with the residents. Chief Administrator reports\nStaff Person 1 does have a tendency of engaging with the\nresidents with a harsh tone and states she will be extending Staff\nPerson 1’s probationary period and increase her supervision.\nAnalysis Consistent youth reports indicate that Staff Person 1 yells at the\nresidents to include the use of a harsh tone especially when\nagitated. Staff Person 1’s harsh tone is not supportive in nature\nwhich instigates the residents to behaviorally act out or become\nangered.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n9/18/23\n______________________________________\nChristopher M Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\n3",
