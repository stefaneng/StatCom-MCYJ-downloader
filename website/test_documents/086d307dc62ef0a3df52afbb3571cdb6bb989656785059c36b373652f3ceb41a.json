    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted regarding an allegation that Catholic Charities of Southeast Michigan failed to report suspected child abuse by a foster parent. The investigation found that the agency's Chief Administrator did file a formal report (DHS-3200) and initiated a special evaluation upon learning of the historic allegations in 2021, and therefore complied with the law. The report concludes the agency is not culpable for the failure-to-report allegation, as the required actions were taken when the information was formally presented to the agency's leadership.",
