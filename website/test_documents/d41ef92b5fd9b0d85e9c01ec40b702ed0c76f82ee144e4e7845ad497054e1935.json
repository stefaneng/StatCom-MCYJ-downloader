EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows.\nSI#2023C0000541, report date 7/11/23 and corrective action plan submitted\n7/20/23, was in violation with R400.12409 (1) Education policy. The agency is\nadhering to their CAP as that has not been any repeat violations.\nInterim inspection report dated 2/2/23 but completed 12/19/22, this was due to\nCWLM system change over. The CAP was completed 12/8/2023. The agency is\nfollowing their corrective action plan as there are no repeat violations this reporting\nperiod.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) discussed the barriers of the agency on 11/29/23,\nand what has improved since the last inspection. The CA reported that agency’s\nstaffing turnover and having too many tasks to complete per case, contributed to\nthe agency non-compliances of the rules and/or contract policies. The CA\nreported that the staff are newly hired, and already show signs of burnt out, and\nbeing overwhelmed with the requirements of their cases. She reported this",
    "contributes to timeliness of completing the required tasks. However, she reported\nspending many hours in executive leadership, and meeting with staff to hear their\nideas, to come up with a strategy to create some relief for staff to improve morale\nand client satisfaction. She also reported the agency was able to increase the\nnumbers of caseworkers from 10 to 12 and the supervisors from 2 to 3. She said\nthere will be 1 supervisor per 4 staff opposed to 1 supervisor per 5 staff.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided their annual audit by an independent certified public\naccountant and an annual budget for the current fiscal year. No concerns were\nnoted.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed reported loving working for the agency. They are provided\nsupport from their coworkers and supervisors. The staff all commented that the\nadministration listen to what they have to say and put forth a lot of efforts to assist\nthem in solving any problems that may arise with the staff and their cases or\nworking with the staff to solve challenges. The staff reported something that can\nbe change in the agency is to hire more visitation staff and to be assigned 3 or 4\ncases while in training. The staff also reported that the supervisors are very\nsupportive but they want the supervisors to discuss issues with them so they can\nlearn and tell them how to improve an issue oppose to telling them things are fine\nwhen it is not.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThere were no areas of concerns noted in the areas of the agency.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe agency had three safety alerts.\nConcern #1.\nThe unlicensed caregiver has a spa and there is no locked cover for the unit. There\nis no alarm on the door that leads to the spa or rescue equipment available.\nResolution:\nThe caregivers own an inflatable hot tub that is located on their back deck. This hot\ntub was measured to be 2 feet tall by the licensing worker on 9/13/2023. The hot tub\nhas a cover; however, it does not lock. The caregiver is unable to find a locking\ncover because the sides of the hot tub are inflatable, and the locking straps sold in\nstores require screws for the sides of the hot tub. It should be noted that the only\nyouth in their home is 14 years old and reportedly measures 5 ' 7\" tall. The caregiver\nalso reports that the youth is able to sit in the spa without the water coming\nanywhere close to his head, due to it being only 2 feet tall, and that he is never\nunsupervised in the hot tub. The hot tub is primarily to help the relative caregiver\nheal from a recent surgery. Additionally, the backyard is fully fenced in, with the\nhome being the fourth barrier, and the gate to the backyard remains locked at all",
    "times. Lastly, the licensing worker installed a CPSC compliant alarm on the door\nleading directly to the hot tub from the back of the home on 9/13/2023. Photos were\nprovided and uploaded in CWLM to support the alert being rectified. During the\nentrance conference the agency confirmed staff went to the home and verified\ncompliance.\nConcern #2.\nAccess was not granted to the bedroom in the basement. A photo is needed of the\nroom. If a bed is assembled in the room, a safety plan is needed. The licensed\ncaregiver has a hot tub. There is an alarm/chime on the door that leads to the hot\ntub, however, it was inoperable. There is no smoke detector in the bedroom in the\nbasement.\nResolution:\nLicensing Supervisor verified a working smoke detector in the caregiver' s\nbasement, as well as a working door alarm on the exterior door leading to the\ncaregiver’s hot tub. This was verified by the caregivers’ providing videos of both the\ndoor alarm and smoke detector in working order, which were taken on 9/11/2023,\nand sent to the Licensing Supervisor on 9/12/2023. Pictures from the videos are\nattached to this alert. Additionally, there is an attached basement safety plan that\nthe caregivers have signed, ensuring that the room in the basement is only intended\nfor storage and cannot be used as a bedroom. The caregivers have provided a\npicture of the room, as it was locked for storage purposes. During the entrance\nconference the agency confirmed staff went to the home and verified compliance.\nConcern #3.\nThe unlicensed caregiver’s have an inground swimming pool. There is a fence\naround the backyard; however, a barrier is recommended around the pool. A safety\nplan for activities involving the pool is needed. There is a bedroom in the basement\nwith a full-size bed and there is no means of egress. The foster youth utilize the\nbedroom for play/leisure activities. A safety plan is needed to address proper\nsleeping arrangements.\nResolution:\nThe entire backyard is enclosed by a fence, and the gate leading to the backyard is\nself-latching and remains locked. There is a CPSC door alarm on the backdoor\nleading to the pool, as the home is the fourth barrier to enclosing the pool. The\nalarm was verified via video by the Licensing Supervisor on 9/13/2023. There is\nsafety equipment, including a reaching pole, for the pool. The youth in the home is\n15 years old and according to his caregiver, is a strong swimmer. The caregivers\nreported that the pool is only 5ft deep all the way across and that the water does not\ncome close to the youth head when he is standing in the pool. There is an attached\nbasement safety plan that the caregivers have signed ensuring that the room cannot\nbe used as a bedroom. All photos are uploaded in CWLM. During the entrance\nconference the agency confirmed staff went to the home and verified compliance.",
