    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 2/02/22, youth was acting out. Staff members A and B at facility recorded\nyouth's behavior. Youth attempted to obtain the cell phones and Staff member A\npushed youth. Youth physically assaulted staff and was later transported to the\nhospital for suicidal ideation and threatening others.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone, on 2/4/2022. She reported Youth A\ninformed her the incident began when he was in the gym “blowing off steam” and a staff\nturned off the lights, so Youth A went outside to “shoot hoops”. Then he asked staff to go get\nhis coat to which they refused, triggering his anger outburst. Staff began to video record him\nwith their phones and he asked them to stop. Staff refused causing him to escalate,\nresulting in Youth A attempting to grab one of their phones at which time staff pushed him.\nJuvenile Justice Worker was interviewed via telephone, on 2/4/2022. He reported\nlearning of the incident from the facility and being surprised since Youth A had been doing\nwell except for the last three week. He believes there may have been a disruption in Youth\nA’s relationship with a close relative that occurred about three weeks ago and resulted in his\nacting out. He has no concerns with the treatment being provided by the facility and believes\nthe facility is keeping Youth A safe while providing the support he needs. The\ncommunication from the facility is very helpful and constant.\nAdministrator was interviewed via telephone, on 2/4/2022 and face-to-face on 2/8/22 at\nthe facility. He reported being aware of the incident and reported Youth A is currently in the\nhospital until Monday. He reported the facility does not have a policy of staff using their\nphones to record youth’s behaviors but is willing to develop one. The facility was unaware of\nthe recording being a trigger but now that they do, steps will be taken to avoid this in the\nfuture.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 2/8/2022. He reported being\nupset over “family issues” lately and “lost control” of his emotions. The restraint was\nappropriate, and no staff mistreated him during the incident. Youth A understands the\nreason the lights were turned off in the gym and believes he needs to learn to control his\nemotions better. Staff 2’s pushing him was “in self-defense and justified”. Youth A feels safe\nat the facility and is being provided treatment to help him cope with his emotions.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 2/8/2022. He reported becoming\ninvolved in the incident when Staff 2 informed him Youth A was outside destroying the\nkeyless entrance at the front door. Upon his reaching the area, Youth A had a shovel handle\nand was beating the door and keyless entry pad. Staff 1 began to video record this behavior\nfor documentation because he knew the cameras mounted on the building did not pick up\nthis section. Youth A may have asked him to stop recording and once he realized his\nrecording was escalating Youth A, he stopped recording. Youth A was picking up pieces of\nthe shovel along with snow boards and sleds and striking staff with these items. Staff 1 also\nreported never observing Staff 2 push Youth A because he was focused on picking up the\nsharp pieces of the shovel, so Youth A didn’t use them as weapons. The restraint used with\nYouth A was a standing two person (one staff securing each arm) that appeared, and they\n3",
    "were constantly talking to him to de-escalate Youth A.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 2/8/2022. He reported Youth A had\n“acted out” earlier in the day and left the unit, going to the gym without permission. Youth A\nbegan to shoot hoops in the gym before Staff 2 turned the lights off to “take away the fun of\nbeing where he was not supposed to be”. Then Youth A went outside and began to throw\nthe basketball against the dining room windows where other youth were doing schoolwork.\nYouth A was disrupting the unit and he began to smash the front door and keyless entry pad\nwith a broken shovel. Staff 2 also reported Staff 1 came onto campus and he asked him to\nassist because Youth A was not de-escalating. Staff 2 has had a good relationship with\nYouth A but was surprised when Youth A hit him several times and finally hit him in the leg\nwith a snow board. Staff 2 pushed Youth A to keep him from using the items on the ground\nas weapons. Supervisor 1 came to assist and initiated a single person restraint with Youth A\nbecause he was hitting staff.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 2/8/2022. She reported not\nbeing present during the incident but talking to Youth A about the incident and viewing the\nvideo recording. The pushing of Youth A appeared to be a defensive move because the\nsituation was very tense. Youth A was throwing things at staff. She also reported finding out\nfrom Youth A after the incident how significant of a trigger video recording is to him. She will\nbe writing this in his treatment plan and discussing with the staff the importance of this\ntrigger in relation to his trauma responses.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on 2/8/2022. He reported\nhaving no history of disciplinary action taken against Staff 1 or Staff 2. He described both\nstaff as having excellent skills when working with the youth.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via telephone, on 2/9/2022. He described the incident\noutside with Youth A throwing items at Staff 2 in the same way described by Staff 1 and\nStaff 2. Youth A was throwing sleds and snow boards at the staff and Supervisor 2 initiated\na single person restraint when Youth A attempted to punch Staff 2. Supervisor 2 did not\nwitness Staff 2 push Youth A during the incident but upon reviewing the video recording he\nwitnessed the push. He reported the push should not have occurred and is not part of the\ntechniques taught for behavior management.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo titled “VID_20220202_0831509862 with a date of 2/2/2022 and reviewed on 2/10/22.\nThis video provides a view of the front door to the facility. This video covers 40 seconds of\ntime. At the beginning of the recording, Youth A is viewed hitting the keyless entry to the\ndoor with what appears to be the handle of a shovel.

Youth A turns and looks towards the camera before throwing the handle\nin the direction of the camera which ends the recording.\nVideo titled “VID_2022-02-02_13-22-00_utc_39 Outside East entrance” with a date of\n2/2/2022 and reviewed on 2/10/22. This video provides a similar view of Youth A at the door\nbut also captures Staff 1 and Staff 2 at the scene.

When\npicking up the broken items, Youth A begins to throw plastic sleds at the staff and then picks\nup a snowboard.
