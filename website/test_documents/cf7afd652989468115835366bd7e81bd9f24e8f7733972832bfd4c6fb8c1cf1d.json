Secondly, the focus is to teach\nclients more constructive, effective ways of dealing with\nstress and painful feelings so that the future risk for\nviolence is reduced.

    "Non-violent – Restrictive intervention is defined a as\nstaff member’s use of physical control to contain a client’s\nacute physical behavior. a physical hold to maximize safety\nand minimize harm, i.e. any behavior that is likely to result\nin physical injury or imminent risk of physical harm of the\nclient, other clients, staff members, or others. These\ninterventions are non-violent and are to be used in such a\nmanner as to not be hostile or injurious. All non-violent\nphysical interventions at Wolverine Human Services will\nfollow the principles established by the CPI curriculum.\nApproved techniques for Restrictive intervention include:\no Standing – low – medium - high\no Seated - low – medium - high\no Team Control – high level\no Children Control position. – low – medium - high\n2. Non-Violent Restrictive Intervention Report (WHS\nIncident Report) is defined as the required documentation\ncompleted whenever any of the above defined forms of\nnon-violent physical interventions are used. Staff\ndocument the incident immediately following conclusion of\nthe incident for supervisory review and response as\nappropriate.\n4. Behavior Notification is defined as the required\ndocumentation completed whenever an incident or event\noccurs which is out of the ordinary and the use of a non-\nviolent physical intervention did not occur. This report is to\naccurately describe the incident and context within which it\noccurred. The forms are region specific.\nC. The Use of Non-Violent Physical Restriction:\nNon-violent physical restrictions are never to be used as a\nform of punishment, discipline, ensuring compliance,\ndemonstrating authority, or retaliation. They are only used\nto protect client or others from unanticipated or severely\naggressive behavior that places them at serious threat of\nviolence or injury if no immediate intervention occurs. The\nsteps leading up to non-violent physical restriction must\nfollow the teachings and principles of the CPI curriculum.\n(Refer to CPI Student Workbook, Edition 2.)\nNon-violent physical interventions may only be initiated by\nstaff that have successfully completed the written\ncomponent, the Life Space Interview evaluation and\ndemonstrated competency in the physical components.\nThey are only to be in place long enough to end the threat\nof serious physical harm.\nStaff members are to continuously monitor the client to\nensure safety and assess for any harmful health or\n13",
    "psychological reactions. If a client being physically\ncontrolled appears to be in physical distress, immediate\nnotification of the Program Manager or designee is to\noccur, and the nonviolent physical intervention technique is\ndiscontinued. Immediate medical evaluation is required\nunder these circumstances. In the event a client displays\nan altered mental status, immediate notification of Program\nManager or designee is to occur and when it is determined\nto be safe the non-violent physical intervention technique is\ndiscontinued.\nThe use and choice of all non-violent physical interventions\nmust be guided by a number of factors including the\nfollowing:\n1. The need to ensure safety of other clients and staff.\n2. The size and strength of the client to be restrained.\n3. The nature and degree of past violent behavior by\nthe client.\n4.
