    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nThe agency requested approval of new office space. The address of the new office\nlocation is 425 Ormsby St. Adrian, MI 49221.\nIII. Methodology\nThe on-site inspection of the new space was completed on 10/19/2020.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe new offices are located in a building that used to be a school for the church\nnext door. The agency is leasing only the main floor of the building for the CPA\nlicense. There is ample parking, two entry doors, and a separate elevator entrance\nfor handicap accessibility. The entries lead to an interior space that has a secured\ndoor to the offices and visitation rooms. Guests will buzz in through the intercom\nfor security.\nThe space is situated along one corridor. There is a kitchen area and two large\nvisitation rooms on one side of the hall. The other side of the hall houses a large\nroom which will serve as multiple staff‘s office spaces. Within this large room is a\nseparate locked room, which will house files. The agency also has a crosscut\nshredder for confidential documents. There are two separate supervisor offices\nand another separate office for the director/Chief Administrator on this side of the\nhall.\nThe space is assessed to be suitable for the CPA license.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend approval of the new office space and no change to the current\nlicense status. The new address will be reflected in upcoming reports after\nprocessing.\nOctober 23, 2020\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved by:\nOctober 26, 2020\n_________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram, Date\nArea Manager\n2"
