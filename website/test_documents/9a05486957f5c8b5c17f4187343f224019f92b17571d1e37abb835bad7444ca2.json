    "CPA Rule 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy\n(1) An agency's medical and dental care policy must, include all the following:\n(c) A physical examination for each child as follows, unless a greater frequency is\nmedically indicated: (ii) A physical examination every 14 months.\nOne of six foster care files held a late medical exam, completed twenty-six\nmonths after the previous exam.\nCPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n(5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents and the foster parents in\nthe development of service plans to enable the parent or parents and foster\nparents to understand the plan for the child and the parents' and the foster\nparent's role in assisting the agency in carrying out the plan.

    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during\nthis period under review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment dated 9/29/25 was reviewed and discussed.\nAs there was not a CAP required after the 1/23/25 Interim review, the agency did\nnot have any CAP progress to report on. The Chief Administrator reported the\nagency continues to have high Key Performance Indicators in most areas.\nHowever, parent & child visits was an area that needed improvement as it was at\n69% compliance. The agency reported one unplanned removal of a child in a pre-\nadoptive home. This was due to a death in the family which impacted the\ncaregiver's ability to meet the child's needs.\nFinancial Overview\nNot applicable.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo foster care staff were interviewed. Both staff had been with the agency for\nover one year. One staff reported they had a great supervisor that was\nknowledgeable, easy to talk to and able to balance when to be involved and when\nto step back. The second staff reported their supervisor was knowledgeable, but\nnot always as helpful as they needed. Both staff reported multiple director\nchanges over the past few years had made things challenging at times. However,\nstaff have been able to work together and support one another. Both staff\nexpressed some concern about being required to return to the office three days a\nweek, as well as the change to the teaming model in the upcoming months. Both\nstaff reported they were just reassigned to a new supervisor, and a new Director\nhas joined their office. Both staff are hopeful the new leadership will make the\ntransitions smooth.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the previous year. The\noffice building has sufficient space for staff to work, as well as visitation and\nmeeting space for clients. The agency has adequate secure storage space for files\nand confidential information, as well as a cross shredder for CHRI.",
