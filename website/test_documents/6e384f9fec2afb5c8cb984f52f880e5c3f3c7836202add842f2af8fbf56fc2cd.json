    "recall if there was a time at the end of December when he was not\nreceiving his Metformin.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via teams on 2/14/2024.\nSupervisor 1 began working at the facility the end of October as a\nsupervisor however became a youth specialist in early February.\nSupervisor 1 did not have any concerns with youth receiving their\nmedications in December 2023. There are occasions when the\nmedications are not in the cart for supervisors to dispense which\noccur when a new youth arrives at the facility and only comes with\none week of medications, the youth will be scheduled with the\nPsychiatrist however it takes time then for the medications to\narrive at the facility. Another situation where medications are not\navailable is when youth run out of the medications and have no\nrefills left, which then typically takes a day for the new prescription\nto come. The only other situation is when youth go to the hospital\nand the hospital calls a prescription into the wrong pharmacy.\nSupervisor 1 did recall some medication not being in the\nmedication cart in December, specifically for Youth Q, and that it\ntook some time for his medication to come to the facility however\nSupervisor 1 did not recall all the specifics. Supervisor 1 also\nrecalled something about Youth P’s Metformin however could not\nrecall specifically what the issue was. Supervisor 1 did not believe\nthere was an issue with the Pharmacy.

Supervisor 2 had\nno concerns with medications in December 2023 that she was\naware of. Health System Coordinator did tell Supervisor 2 she had\nreached out to the pharmacy several times regarding medications\nthat were out at the facility and new medications not being\nreceived. Supervisor 2 reported she was unsure of the specifics\nof the situation as Health System Coordinator in responsible for\nthat part and Supervisor 2 is responsible for passing the\nmedications to youth that are available in the cart. Supervisor 2\n3",
    "recalled an issue with Youth P’s Metformin however did not recall\nspecifics regarding what the issue was.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via teams on 2/14/2024.\nSupervisor 3 passes medications typically on the afternoon shift\nhowever occasionally works the morning shift. Supervisor 3 did\nnot have any concerns with youth not receiving medications in\nDecember 2023 or ever. Supervisor 3 reported there are times at\nthe facility where youth run out of medications before refills arrive\nat the facility. At times when new youth arrive, youth come with a\nminimum of seven days of medications and the youth see the\nPsychiatrist on the next scheduled day the Psychiatrist is\nscheduled to provide services at the facility at which time the\nPsychiatrist will prescribe medications which typically take a day\nto arrive at the facility however sometimes longer depending on\nthe specific youth and situation. Supervisor 3 reported there has\nbeen times where youth medications are not in the medication\ncart. When this occurs, Supervisor 3 leaves a note in the\nsupervisor log and in the electronic MAR, as well as notifies the\nHealth System Coordinator by putting the empty medication\npackage in the Health System Coordinator’s mailbox. The\nmedications that are not available in the cart are typically for new\nyouth at the facility. Supervisor 3 reported he worked on\n12/25/2023 however he worked the 7am-3pm shift. Supervisor 3\ndid not recall if there was an issue with Youth P’s Metformin in\nDecember 2023. Supervisor 3 reported there should never be a\nblank on the MAR as there should always be some sort of\ndocumentation to say if the youth refused, if the medication was\nnot available, or if the youth was out of the facility on a home\npass. Typically, there are two supervisors scheduled for the\nafternoon shift and supervisors coordinate to determine who is\npassing medications.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed face-to-face at Clarence\nFischer House on 2/5/2024 and via teams on 2/9/2024.\nAdministrator 1 reported he was not aware of any medication\nissues with Advanced Specialty RX at Wolverine Center.\nWolverine Center has been working with Advanced Specialty RX\nhas been the pharmacy used for some time. Administrator 1 was\naware there were some medication shortages at the pharmacy but\nwas not able to recall any specifics. Administrator 1 reported he\nhas been made aware of missed medications at Wolverine\nCenter. Administrator 1 was made aware of some medication\nshortages and advised Nurse to resolve the issue by contacting\nPsychiatrist to try to see about alternative medications.\nPsychiatrist was not returning the phone calls. Administrator 1\n4",
    "reported the facility completes a ASE/ Facilities Checklist however\nit has been found that this is not as thorough and has not been\nbeing completed as it was intended to be. Administrator 1 reported\nthe manifest form is a form used by Advanced Specialty RX and\nthe facility does not do anything with the manifest other than\nmaintain the form. Advanced Specialty RX enters all the\nprescriptions into the electronic MAR when the prescription is\nreceived from Psychiatrist. There was an issue where the\nmedications were being entered into the MAR however the\nprescription was not received at the facility resulting in the MAR\nshowing the youth did not receive the medication for the first one\nto two days after being prescribed. Administrator 1 reported this\nissue has been rectified as now the facility is able to change the\nstart date in the MAR to the day the prescription arrives at the\nfacility. Staff are trained to pass medications at the facility by the\nfacility trainer as well as the facility provides video trainings.\nAdvanced Specialty RX came to the facility in August or\nSeptember 2023 and provided a training as well as provided\ntraining videos.\nAdministrator 2 was interviewed via teams meeting on\n2/9/2024. Administrator 2 reported there was an issue with Youth\nP’s medication in December as Youth P receives all of his\nmedications in a liquid form and the medications arrived and one\nof the bottles was broken. Administrator 2 did not recall the\nspecific as to which medication this was. Advanced Specialty RX\nwas contacted regarding the issue and sent out the medication to\nreplace the broken bottle. When youth get low on medications\nHealth System Coordinator does weekly medication counts and\nwill notify the Psychiatrist via team notes which youth need refills.\nIf a youth runs out of a medication the shift supervisor notifies\nadministration team on the team chat the facility uses and Health\nSystem Coordinator will replenish the medication in the cart.\nAdministrator 2 reported the facility completes a ASE/ Facilities\nChecklist however did not know if this was completed for\nDecember. Administrator 2 reported when youth come to the\nfacility it is required the youth comes with a minimum of seven\ndays of medications which allows time for the youth to see the\nPsychiatrist at the next scheduled appointment after their arrival.\nPsychiatrists meet with youth on Wednesdays. Psychiatrist will\nmeet with the youth and then prescribe medications which the\nPsychiatrist sends to Advanced Specialty RX. Administrator 2 did\nnot know what process Psychiatrist uses to send the prescriptions\nto Advanced Specialty RX. Medications arrive to the facility from\nAdvanced Specialty RX via FedEx in one to two days. If a\nmedication does not arrive, Health System Coordinator follows up\n5",
    "with Advanced Specialty RX to see if the prescription was not sent\nover by the Psychiatrist or why it was not received. Administrator 2\nreported she did not know if the shipping manifest from Advanced\nSpecialty RX is being filled out by the facility. Medications are put\ninto the medication cart by Health System Coordinator if she is\nworking when the medications arrive at the facility or if it is outside\nHealth System Coordinators hours of work, the supervisor opens\nthe medications and places the medications in Health System\nCoordinators mailbox. Staff use “medication not available” on the\nMAR when the medication is not available to the staff to provide to\nthe youth. Administrator 2 reported upon her reviewing the MAR\nfor all youth in December, the majority of the “medications not\navailable” appear to be due to the medication passer not being\nable to locate the medication in the cart as there were several\nwhere the medication was given before and after the date where it\nwas marked as “medication not available”. Administrator 2\nreported there should never be blanks on the MAR. Administrator\n2 reported Health System Coordinator is now sending her weekly\nmedication counts to her as a result of this special investigation.\nAdministrator 2 had previously been getting the weekly medication\ncounts however this process stopped for about one month and\nnow it is implemented again.\nNurse was interviewed face-to-face at Clarence Fischer\nHouse on 2/5/2024. Nurse is in contact with LPN at Wolverine\nCenter who handles the medications at the facility. LPN\naddresses medications at Wolverine Center however is in regular\ncommunication with Nurse if there is medication not coming into\nthe facility from the pharmacy or is medications are missed by\nstaff. Nurse reported she was not made aware of any pharmacy\nissues with medications by LPN. Nurse was aware of some issues\nin December where the Psychiatrist was not refilling medications\nand sending the prescriptions to the pharmacy and the\nPsychiatrist was not returning phone calls.\nHealth System Coordinator was interviewed via teams on\n2/9/2024. Health Systems Coordinator is responsible for\nscheduling youth medical appointments, taking youth to\nappointments, monitoring medications, and providing updates to\nthe Psychiatrist when youth are getting low on medications for the\nPsychiatrist to provide the pharmacy with a new prescription. The\nonly issue Health System Coordinator is aware of that occurred\nwith medications in December 2023 was Youth P’s liquid\nmedication bottle arrived broken at the facility from the pharmacy\nand it contaminated Youth C and Youth J’s medications. Health\nSystem Coordinator contacted the pharmacy immediately about\n6",
    "the issue and the pharmacy resent Youth P, Youth C, and Youth\nJ’s medications. The medications arrived the next afternoon. The\nonly impact this had was Youth J did not get his morning antibiotic\nmedication. Youth P also came to the facility from home and when\nhe arrived at the facility, he had an empty bottle of Sertraline and\ndue to Youth P just arriving at the facility, the facility had Youth P\nmeet with the Psychiatrist who then prescribed the medication and\nsignatures needed to be obtained from Youth P’s parent as it is a\npsychotropic medication. Once that occurred, Youth P began the\nmedication. Health System Coordinator reported no other\nmedication issues in December. Health System Coordinator\ndenied youth at the facility did not receive their medications in\nDecember due to Advanced Specialty RX not delivering the\nmedication. The facility has been working with Advanced\nSpecialty RX for over a year. Advanced Specialty RX medications\narrive within a day and a half of the prescription being sent to the\npharmacy. Health System Coordinator reported she did not recall\never reaching out to Nurse in December 2023 and reporting\nconcerns with youth medications not being sent to the facility by\nAdvanced Specialty RX. In the MAR if there is a blank it usually\nmeans the staff passing medications had a situation happen\nrequiring them to step away from passing medications and\nforgetting where they left out documenting in the electronic MAR.\nMedication not available is used in the MAR when a medication\nhas not yet arrived at the facility. Health System Coordinator\nreported there is a refill drawer of medications and sometimes\nstaff forget to check the refill drawer if a medication runs out.\nHealth System Coordinator does complete weekly medication\ncounts to see if new prescriptions are needed by the Psychiatrist.\nHealth System Coordinator does not cross reference the\nmedication count with the MAR to ensure the medication matches\nwhat should be left per the MAR.\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on 2/1/2024.\nComplainant did not have any specific youth who were impacted\nby the allegations.

    "are having to mark it on the MAR as medication not\navailable in cart as it is discontinued.\n• Supervisor 1, Supervisor 2, Supervisor 3’s personnel file:\nSupervisor 1 has an employee counseling form dated\n1/22/2024 for failure to follow medical pass procedures and\ndocumentation on several occasions if a youth was or was\nnot provided their medication. Supervisor 1 received\nmedication training on 11/14/2023, Supervisor 2 on\n1/24/2023 and 6/14/2023, and Supervisor 3 on 2/22/2022,\n6/14/2022, 1/24/2023, and 9/15/2023.\nAnalysis The facility is found in noncompliance. There are several youth\nand dates where the MAR was left blank, and it is unknown if the\nyouth were provided their medications. There appears to be an\ninternal issue of staff locating the medications in the cart as there\nare several youth on several days that indicate medication is not\navailable however the medication per the MAR was given on days\nand times in-between when it is documented the medication is not\navailable. There is an issue with the facility running out of youth\nmedication which appears to be an internal issue with refills not\nbeing requested in a timely manner prior to youth running out of\nmedication. There also appears to be an issue with the facility\nrequesting refills from the Psychiatrist and receiving the refills\ntimely. It is unclear if the facility is waiting until the medication is\nout to request refills or is not preparing for refills in an adequate\ntimeframe to allow the Psychiatrist to refill the medication and the\npharmacy to ship the medication.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is recommended the facility update their internal policy and\nprocedure to include a policy for administering medications while\nyouth are off grounds, clear direction for staff on coding\nmedication notes to include how it should be documented for\nhome passes as the facility codes differently using home pass and\nmedication given to family. It is recommended the facility\naddresses youth being removed from the MAR on the date of\ndischarge or having a way for staff to code this accurately as there\nwere several youth who had been discharged and medications are\ncoded as not available when the youth is no longer in the facility.\nIt is also recommended the facility only document medications\nbeing given in the MAR and not in the Youth Care Worker\nSupervisor Logbook. It is recommended the facility create an\ninternal procedure of proactively requesting medication refills in a\ntimely manner to allow for the medications to arrive prior to youth\nrunning out of medications. Additionally, it is recommended the\n12",
