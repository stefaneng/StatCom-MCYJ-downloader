    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 9/2/2025. The agency\nhad no rule violations during its 2024 Renewal inspection and so no corrective\naction plan was required. In this 2025 chief administrator’s (CA)report the CA\nreported on the number of disruptions the agency experienced and some reasons\nfor those disruptions. The CA also indicated what the agency assessed as its\nstrengths and challenges. The former included the agency being the only program\nin the community to serve non-system homeless youth age 16 and up; and the\nmultiple opportunities it offers to youths to challenge themselves and learn new\nskills. In terms of the latter, it indicated it greatest challenge is the recruitment and\nretention of qualified staff after seasoned staff leaves. The CA reported the\nremaining staff have aided in this area by working overtime.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a copy of its 2024/2025 annual budget; and 9/30/2024,\nindependent financial audit. A review of these documents did not show any areas\nof concern.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator and a case manager, I\ninterviewed a youth specialist. The staff members reported positives about the\nprogram, which included that the administration listens to staff ideas, the agency\nstaff all work together as a team; and they provide and encourage the youths.\nArea of growth indicated were for the program’s intake to increase; and for new\nworkers to be more mature.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nDuring my walk through of the facility, no areas of concern or safety issues were\nobserved. Staff and youths have sufficient space and supplies to meet their\nneeds; and youth files were safely stored.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis agency is not contracted with the Michigan Department of Health and Human\nServices (MDHHS) to provide foster care placement or certification services;\ntherefore, this is not applicable.\n3",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the agency continue on their\nregular license.\nSeptember 18, 2025\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 19, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
