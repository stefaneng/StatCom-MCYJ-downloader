That DHS-\n69s cited last year for change of placement documentations are being completed\nand its CAP on medicals and dentals has been effective.

No financial\ndocumentation is required.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to discussion with the chief administrator, a section manager and three\nsupervisors, three foster care workers, and one licensing worker were interviewed.\nThe staff interviewed reported support from coworkers and managerial staff, good\ncommunication during staff meetings, and that their supervisor and the director will\nreach out to praise them. Areas of growth reported related to some supervisors\nneeding to be more consistent with scheduled supervisions, more worker\nchecklists to aid and educate workers so that required things/tasks are not missed,\nand continued appreciation and understanding from management about the\nstresses on foster care workers and the challenges of the job.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency’s office did not reveal any areas of concern.
