    "Youth A reported on or around Easter or Spring of 2009 (March,\nApril, or May), he was placed at Kid’s First, which was located on\nSt. John’s Home Residential’s campus. Youth A reported Staff 2\nworked as a youth counselor/specialist at St. John’s Home\nResidential and, near the end of May 2009, he would have sexual\nrelations with her. He reported he would have vaginal intercourse\nwith Staff 2 in the bathroom of the facility, in his bedroom at the\nfacility, in the basement of Kid’s First or at Staff 2’s residence.\nYouth A reported he did not wear a condom and ejaculated inside\nher. Youth A reported they had sexual intercourse on five or six\noccasions at Kid’s First. Youth A reported Youth C, Youth D and\nYouth G witnessed Youth A having sex with Staff 2 and Youth A\nalso witnessed the other youth having sexual intercourse with\nStaff 2. Youth A reported Staff 2 would drive the youth to her\nresidence in her car or the Kid’s First vehicle. Youth A reported\nStaff 2 would say they were going to the YMCA, but she would\nonly drop a couple youth off at the YMCA, and she would take the\nothers, including Youth A, to her residence. Youth A reported her\nresidence was in a neighborhood near Kid’s First. Youth A denied\nanyone else being at the residence. Youth A reported\napproximately five or six times, he and Staff 2 had sexual\nintercourse and oral sex at Staff 2’s residence. Youth A reported\nafter leaving her residence, they would return to the YMCA or go\nto the mall before returning to Kid’s First. Youth A denied being\nforced to have sexual relations with Staff 2. Youth A reported Staff\n2 would allow him to stay up late, play video games, and “a lot of\ngood stuff”. Youth A reported he left Kid’s First in 2009 and was\nplaced in a different facility. Youth A reported in 2011, he was\nplaced at Hunting House at St. John’s Home Residential. Youth A\nreported in 2011, he told Staff 1 and Director about his encounters\nwith Staff 2 in 2009. Youth A reported Director stated she would\ninvestigate the situation, but he heard from staff (couldn’t\nremember who), she just wanted to “sweep it under the rug” and\nnot do anything about it. Youth A reported Staff 1 told him it was\nhandled and didn’t want to talk about the situation.\nYouth A reported on or around the summer of 2011, he went to\nStaff 1’s residence with a group of other youth from the facility so\nthey could go swimming. Youth A reported Staff 1 would take him,\nYouth B and/or Youth D to the mall or skating rink “Fun Spot”.\nYouth A reported sometimes Staff 1 would drop the other youth off\nat the skating rink and then would take Youth A to her residence\ninstead of taking him to work at Craig’s Cruisers. Youth A reported\na couple times, he went to Staff 1’s residence with just her and\nYouth B. Youth A reported when he and Staff 1 went to Staff 1’s\nhome, they started out with small talk and then Staff 1 asked\n3",
    "Youth A if he would have sex with her. Youth A reported he was\n“at first not with it, but she was persistent”. Youth A reported they\nwould perform oral sex on each other, and he would have vaginal\nintercourse with her. Youth A reported he thinks it happened\napproximately five or six times at Staff 1’s residence. Youth A\nrecalled another time he was with Staff 1 at her residence, Staff 1\nbegan kissing him and then she performed oral sex on him. Youth\nA reported they then went to a “plain bedroom” with cream colored\nand dark brown walls and laid down on the bed. Youth A reported\nwhile on the bed, he performed oral sex on her and then he had\nsex with her. Youth A reported he did not wear a condom and he\nejaculated inside her. Youth A reported afterwards, they went\nback to the skating rink to pick up some other youth and went\nback to the facility. Youth A reported Staff 1 would have sex with\nhim at the facility as well. Youth A reported they would have sex in\nhis bedroom and in the basement of Hunting House whenever\nthey could get time alone. Youth A reported Staff 1 would\ncommunicate with him via a cell phone he was able to obtain.\nYouth A reported because he would have sex with her, Staff 1\nwould buy him shoes at the mall or food. Youth A reported Youth\nB told him he did things with Staff 1 too, but Youth A did not\nwitness anything. Youth A denied being forced to have sexual\nrelations with Staff 1. Youth A denied telling any staff at the facility\nabout this information and stated no staff at the facility knew what\nwas happening. This information was disclosed during the civil\ncase which is what initiated the current investigation. Youth A\nreported when he was older and attending college classes, he\nsaw Staff 1 in downtown Grand Rapids, they talked for a few\nminutes, and then he went to class.\nYouth A reported in 2011 while he was placed in Hunting House at\nthe facility, the house supervisor was Staff 3. Youth A reported on\nor around October 2011, Staff 3 was upset with Youth A for\nskipping school because Staff 3 assumed Youth A was doing\ndrugs and felt Youth A was “the leader of the pack”. Youth A\nreported Staff 3 picked him and Youth B up from school and took\nthem to Staff 3’s residence. Youth A reported Staff 3 conducted a\nstrip search of Youth A and Youth B at the residence because\nStaff 3 thought they were bringing drugs into the facility. Youth A\nreported he was completely naked, and Staff conducted an anal\ncavity search with his fingers on Youth A and Youth B. Youth A\nreported neither youth wanted to allow the search, but Staff 3 told\nYouth A if he didn’t cooperate, he would be sent to a new\nplacement or would no longer be allowed to attend off-campus\nschool. Youth A reported after the search was completed, they left\nStaff 3’s home and returned to the facility. Youth A denied telling\n4",
    "anyone about the incident or informing staff at the facility about\nthe strip search. Youth A reported Staff 3 lived in a white house\nwith a small yard, located near Sweet St. and Dale St. in Grand\nRapids. Youth A noted it was near Creston High School, which is\nwhere he attended school. Youth A denied ever seeing Staff 3 in\nthe yard or street outside of Staff 3’s home or saying hi to him.\nYouth A reported he never lived on Dale St. but had friends who\nstayed on Sweet St., which runs parallel to it and would go to their\nhomes sometimes. Youth A reported one time he went AWOL and\nwent to another home in that area, which was the residence of\nanother youth he met in placement. Youth A reported another time\nhe went AWOL, went to another friend’s home who lived in that\nneighborhood, and then went to the laundromat in the\nneighborhood to call and get a ride back to the facility. Youth A\nthen changed his story and reported he was never in the\nneighborhoods by Creston High School between 2009-2011\nbecause he was in placement, didn’t have any friends in those\nneighborhoods between 2009-2011, and didn’t know any St.\nJohn’s Home Residential staff members who lived in the\nneighborhood by the school.\nYouth A reported in early November 2011, he and Youth B were\nwaiting to be picked up from basketball practice at Creston High\nSchool. He reported they waited for an hour before they walked\ndown the street to North End Convenience Store to purchase\nsnacks. Youth A reported they then walked to his girlfriend’s\nhouse and asked her mother to give them a ride back to the\nfacility. Youth A reported when they arrived at the facility, Staff 4\nsaid he was not allowing them in without a strip search because\nstaff members were informed several individuals witnessed Youth\nA and Youth B stealing snacks from Meijer instead of attending\nbasketball practice. Youth A reported he told Staff 4 no and said\nhe would not be allowing a strip search. Youth A reported Staff 4\ntold them if they didn’t comply, he would call the police and report\nthey were stealing from Meijer. Youth A reported he went inside\nHunting House reluctantly, entered the first room on the left, and\nStaff 4 conducted a strip search. Youth A reported he was\ncompletely naked, and Staff 4 looked at him during the search, but\ndenied Staff 4 touched him during the strip search. Youth A\ndenied telling anyone about the incident or informing staff at the\nfacility about the strip search. Youth A reported Staff 4 would play\nbasketball with him at the facility and would smack Youth A’s butt\nor rub up against Youth A too closely while playing. Youth A\ndenied reporting these concerns to anyone.\n5",
    "Youth C was interviewed face to face at Ionia Correctional\nFacility on 2/20/24 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth\nC reported he remembers a youth with Youth A’s first name but\ncouldn’t remember his last name. Youth C reported he was never\npresent for any sexual encounters between Youth A and Staff 2.\nYouth C reported he never saw Staff 2 interact with Youth A\ninappropriately and never heard of Youth A and Staff 2 having\nsexual encounters with each other.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face on 1/31/24 alone by\nMDHHS Worker and via phone on 3/1/24 by this Consultant.\nStaff 1 reported she worked at the facility from February/March\n2011 until June 2013. She reported she began as a direct care\nstaff member at Hunting House and was promoted to a supervisor\nin September/October 2011. Staff 1 reported Staff 3 was her\npredecessor and trained her to be a supervisor prior to him\nleaving the facility. Staff 1 reported she did not have any concerns\nabout Staff 3’s interactions with any youth and no youth ever\ndisclosed any concerns to her regarding Staff 3. Staff 1 reported\nwhen staff members were concerned about a youth having\ncontraband, they would look through a youth’s backpack or bag\nand then they would have the youth empty their pockets and\nremove their shoes. Staff 1 reported if they felt the youth was\nhiding something in their clothes, two staff members would take\nthe youth to the bathroom and have them change their clothes\n(except their underwear) so staff could search the clothing. Staff 1\nreported youth were never strip searched or forced to remove all\ntheir clothing during a contraband search.\nStaff 1 reported she remembered Youth A. Staff 1 reported within\na year after she stopped working at the facility, she ran into Youth\nA in downtown Grand Rapids in front of the parking garage. Staff\n1 reported she was walking to or from court and he told her he\nwas on his way to class. Staff 1 reported he said, “Hey Ms. [Staff\n1]”, they exchanged some casual conversation about how they\nwere doing, and then they parted ways.\nStaff 1 reported she did not know Staff 2 because Staff 2 left the\nfacility approximately 2 years before Staff 1 began working there.\nStaff 1 denied Youth A ever talked to her about Staff 2, disclosed\nany concerns to her about Staff 2 or disclosed being sexually\nabused by Staff 2.\nStaff 1 reported she did not remember taking Youth A, Youth B,\nand/or Youth D to Fun Spot, but she might have taken them to the\nmall. Staff 1 did not recall a situation where she dropped some\n6",
    "youth off at a mall and took other youth to another location. Staff 1\nreported staff would utilize the facility’s clothing allowance funds to\npurchase youth clothes and shoes, but she never used her\npersonal money to purchase things for youth. Staff 1 reported the\nonly time she ever bought any clothing or shoes for Youth A was\nutilizing the facility’s money when they went on a group trip with\nother youth and staff to go school shopping. Staff 1 reported these\nshopping trips happened twice per year. Staff 1 reported she\nnever purchased a cell phone for Youth A, never communicated\nwith him via cell phone, and was not aware he had a cell phone\nwhile at the facility.\nStaff 1 reported she lived with her parents when she initially began\nworking at the facility. Staff 1 reported they had an inground pool\nsurrounded by a concrete patio as well as a basketball court, so\nshe would have staff come over to hang out sometimes. Staff 1\nalso noted they would have youth from the facility come to the\nhome during the summer to swim in the pool. Staff 1 reported this\nwas approved by Program Manager as another summer activity\nthey could do besides going to the YMCA. Staff 1 reported they\nwent to her parents’ home to swim more than once but less than\nfive times. Staff 1 reported there were approximately 3-4 youth\nand at least one other staff member that went each time. Staff 1\nreported her parents were also home each time they went. Staff 1\nreported Youth A was one youth in the group of youth that went to\nher parent’s house to go swimming. Staff 1 reported the youth\nwere not allowed inside the home, and they were only allowed to\nuse the bathroom immediately inside the entrance door. Staff 1\nreported only one person was allowed in the bathroom at a time\nfor safety reasons.\nStaff 1 reported she never took Youth A to her parents’ home\nalone, and she was never there alone with any other youth either.\nStaff 1 reported there was never a time when she dropped other\nyouth off at a skating rink and let Youth A skip work and come\nhome with her instead. Staff 1 denied ever being alone with Youth\nA at the facility. Staff 1 reported because it was a male youth\nhome, she and other female staff were very conscious not to be\nalone with youth. Staff 1 denied she ever had sex or performed\nsexual acts with any youth, including Youth A, at her parents’\nhouse, another residence, or anywhere at the facility. Staff 1\nreported she has no idea why Youth A would allege these things\nbecause they never happened.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 1/31/24 by Primary\nConsultant in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2\n7",
    "reported she worked at the facility from 2008-2009 and was\nemployed at Kid’s First, which was located on St. John’s campus,\nbut was a different facility. Staff 2 reported she was cross trained\nat St. John’s Home Residential facility as well but did not work in\nthe homes on their campus. Staff 2 reported she worked an entry\nlevel position where she was a counselor working directly with the\nyouth, but clarified she was not a therapist. Staff 2 admitted to\nhaving CSC charges she pled down to third or fourth degree. Staff\n2 reported these charges were a result of her having sex with two\nyouth (Youth C and Youth E) at Kid’s First. Staff 2 reported she\ndoesn’t remember a youth with Youth A’s name. Staff 2 denied\never having sex or performing any sexual acts with Youth A. Staff\n2 reported she never had any sexual relations with youth at St.\nJohn’s Home Residential. Staff 2 reported she has no idea why\nthese allegations are being made because she doesn’t even know\nwho Youth A is.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 1/31/24 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported he worked at the facility\nfrom 2009 until August/September 2011. He reported he was\ninitially a direct care worker, but then became the house\nsupervisor at Hunting House. Staff 3 reported he never heard any\nallegations from youth or staff about any youth or staff having\ninappropriate relationships. Staff 3 reported if he would have\nheard about any inappropriate things going on, he absolutely\nwould have reported it. Staff 3 reported he was not sure if there\nwas a policy or training stating staff members could not take youth\nto their homes, but there was a rule they could not be friends with\nyouth on social media.\nBefore being asked about the specific allegations, Staff 3 was\nasked to describe the color and location of the home he lived in\nwhile working at the facility. Staff 3 reported his home was down\nthe street from Creston High School, which is where a lot of the\nyouth from the facility attended school. Staff 3 was asked if he\never saw Youth A or Youth B outside of the facility. Staff 3\nreported at one point after he stopped working at the facility,\nYouth B must have lived around his neighborhood because he\nwould see Youth B riding around on his bike sometimes. Staff 3\nreported in 2012 (after he stopped working at the facility), Youth A\nmoved to or visited a home two doors down from him. Staff 3\nreported one time he was outside his home, saw Youth A, they\nsaid “hi” to each other, and then Youth A continued walking. Staff\n3 reported he only saw Youth A in the neighborhood a couple\ntimes after that. Staff 3 was then asked more specific questions\nrelated to the allegations. Staff 3 reported there were times he had\n8",
    "to pick youth up (including Youth A and Youth B) from the school\nand bring them back to the facility. Staff 3 reported he doesn’t\nremember there ever being concerns of Youth A or Youth B\nbringing drugs to the facility. Staff 3 doesn’t remember there being\na situation where he picked Youth A and Youth B up from school\nfor that reason, and Staff 3 reported he never brought them back\nto his home after picking them up from school.\nStaff 3 was asked what staff would do if they had suspicions of\nyouth having contraband. Staff 3 reported typically whichever staff\nmember on shift had the best relationship with the youth would be\nthe one to approach a youth and ask about contraband. Staff 3\nreported if a youth came back from AWOL, an outing, school, etc.\nand there was suspicion they had drugs or other contraband, staff\nmembers would search their bag or backpack. Staff 3 reported if\nthere was a concern the youth was high, the facility would drug\ntest the youth. Staff 3 reported if there were concerns about\ncontraband, staff members would have to search the youth’s\nroom, search their belongings, inventory items, have the youth\nempty their pockets and ask the youth if they had any contraband.\nStaff 3 reported if nothing was found during these searches, they\nwould be done. Staff 3 reported he has never been a part of any\nsearches asking a youth to remove their clothes or pat a youth\ndown, and they were never trained to do either of those kinds of\nsearches. Staff 3 reported he doesn’t know of any strip searches\nor cavity searches ever being performed by any staff. Staff 3\nvehemently denied ever completing a strip search or cavity search\non any youth, including Youth A and Youth B. Staff 3 reported\nhaving any youth complete a strip search or any staff completing a\ncavity search on a youth would be completely inappropriate. Staff\n3 was shocked and appalled by the allegations and did not know\nwhy these allegations were made, because they never happened.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 2/26/24 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 4 doesn’t remember any concerns\nregarding Staff 1 and never heard or saw her do anything\ninappropriate. Staff 4 doesn’t remember them being allowed to\ntake youth to Staff 1’s parent’s pool. Staff 4 reported they had a\nYMCA membership for swimming, so he doesn’t know why they\nwould have swum anywhere else. Staff 4 reported Staff 3 was\nvery “by the book” and strictly followed policies/procedures. Staff 4\nreported when a youth returned from AWOL, staff members had to\nsearch the youth’s belongings and have the youth empty their\npockets because it was policy, but that’s all they had to do. Staff 4\nreported he never heard of or saw any staff members conducting\nstrip searches for any youth. Staff 4 reported he never conducted\n9",
    "or participated in a strip search for Youth A, Youth B, or any other\nyouth. Staff 4 reported the facility was very strict about how and\nwhen searches were done and ensuring policies were followed.\nStaff 4 reported the facility never allowed staff members to be\nalone with youth except during mentoring sessions. Staff 4\nreported any contraband searches were completed with 2 or more\nstaff members present. Staff 4 reported he remembered Youth A\nbeing good at basketball and remembered playing basketball with\nhim and others. Staff 4 reported he never did anything\ninappropriate with any of the youth, including Youth A, while\nplaying basketball with them. Staff 4 reported he never smacked\nYouth A’s butt or any other youths’ butts while playing basketball\nbecause it is very inappropriate.\nProgram Manager (PM) was interviewed face to face on\n2/12/24 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. PM reported she\nstarted working at the facility in the summer of 2010 and left in the\nfall of 2018. PM reported the general rule of thumb for contraband\nsearches was to conduct the least invasive search possible for the\nscenario. She reported there were certain protocols in place for\ncertain youth if there was an elevated risk factor (i.e. self-harm,\nsuicide-risk, etc.). She reported they didn’t regularly search youth,\nand only conducted searches if there was reasonable suspicion,\nor returning from AWOL, employment, outings, or home visits. PM\nreported the house manager, and the therapist would agree what\nprotocol was necessary for the scenario and the youth. PM\nreported strip searches or cavity searches were never allowed,\nauthorized, or trained. PM reported if there was suspicion a youth\nhad contraband in their clothes, at least two staff would take a set\nof clean clothes and ask the youth to change in the bathroom so\nthey could check the clothes the youth was wearing. PM reported\nthe youth would be in the bathroom by themselves with the door\nclosed. PM reported she never received any information, concerns\nor complaints from any youth or staff regarding strip searches or\ncavity searches occurring.\nPM reported each youth was assigned a mentor/advocate staff\nmember who could take the youth on outings, but there was never\nauthorization provided for staff to take a youth to their home. PM\nreported they ran a relationship-based program, so mentor\nrelationships were supposed to be close between youth and staff,\nbut only in a therapeutic way. PM reported before any outing could\noccur, the staff member would have to fill out a detailed form with\nspecific information (i.e. location, timeframe, participants, crisis\nplan, etc.), and have it approved by the house manager.\n10",
    "PM reported she never had any concerns about Staff 1 and no\nyouth ever brought any concerns to her regarding Staff 1. PM\nreported Staff 1 was a great worker and house manager and all\nthe youth loved her. PM reported she doesn’t remember\napproving Staff 1 to take youth to her parent’s house to swim, but\nshe couldn’t say for certain. PM reported typically the approval\nwould come from another house manager and might not rise to\nher level of approval. PM reported they took the youth to swim at\nthe YMCA often too, and there were always rules in place\nregarding staff supervision, only one youth going to the bathroom\nat a time to change, etc.\nPM reported she does not know Staff 2 because Staff 2 was\nterminated from employment before PM began working at the\nfacility. PM reported she never had any concerns about Staff 3\nand the only concerns youth ever stated were Staff 3 was too\nstrict, very structured and a consistent rule follower. PM does not\nremember Staff 4’s name or any information about him. PM\nreported Youth A never brought any concerns or complaints to her\nregarding his alleged sexual relationship with Staff 1 and Staff 2,\nor inappropriate touches/searches by Staff 3 and Staff 4. PM\nreported if Youth A would have shared any of these concerns with\nher or Director, they would have immediately begun an internal\ninvestigation and referred the complaints to the proper authorities.\nDirector was interviewed face to face on 2/13/24 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Director reported she started\nworking at the facility in 2006, became the Director of Kid’s First,\nthen became the Director of the entire facility campus in 2010, and\nthen left the facility in 2016. Director reported staff were not\nallowed to take kids to their personal homes and any outings off-\ncampus needed approval. Director doesn’t remember a situation\nwhere any staff members were allowed to take youth to their\nparent’s pool to go swimming. Director reported they had access\nto community pools, so she doesn’t know why that would have\nhappened or been allowed. Director reported she put a high\nimportance on liability and, had she known, she would have\ncontacted their licensing consultant at the time for consultation\nprior to approving something like that. Director doesn’t remember\nStaff 1 or Staff 4 but does remember Staff 2 and Staff 3. Director\nreported Staff 3 was a really good staff member and she doesn’t\nremember hearing any concerns or complaints about him. Director\nreported she remembers Staff 2 because of the lawsuit, criminal\ninvestigation, and licensing investigation after Staff 2’s\ninappropriate sexual encounters with youth at the facility. Director\nreported they had an open-door policy for concerns and\n11",
    "complaints from youth, there was a box to leave anonymous\nnotes/complaints, there would be scheduled townhall meetings to\ncheck in with youth about staff/services/etc., and quarterly\nanonymous surveys were given to youth as well. Director reported\nshe doesn’t remember Youth A or Youth B. Director reported she\ndoesn’t remember a youth with Youth A’s name disclosing\ninformation to her about Staff 2. Director reported if a youth would\nhave disclosed anything regarding inappropriate conduct by a staff\nmember, she would have dealt with it right away and contacted\nlicensing. Director reported for contraband searches, there was\nalways more than one staff doing the search. Director reported\nshe doesn’t remember there being a lot of concerns or issues\nsurrounding contraband being brought to the facility.
