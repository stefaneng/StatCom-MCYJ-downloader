Youth then left and walked\nthe road until a stranger picked the youth up. Youth was taken to\nthe police department. Staff followed the vehicle, but did not stop\nthe youth from walking along the road, crossing a busy highway,\nor the stranger from picking the youth up. The stranger contacted\nthe police before the facility did. This is not the first time an\nincident like this has occurred with the facility\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nLaw Enforcement (LE) was interviewed via phone on 1/10/25.\nLE reported the original call that came in was from the strangers\nwho picked Youth A up. LE reported the strangers stated they\nfound a girl walking by herself with no shoes or jacket, and they\nwere bringing her to the police department. LE reported a few\nminutes later, one of the facility’s staff (couldn’t remember her\nname) called and said Youth A got into a stranger’s car and she\nwas following the stranger’s vehicle. LE reported both cars pulled\ninto the police department, and she went to speak to the facility\nstaff. LE reported the facility staff didn’t check on Youth A right\naway and Youth A remained in the stranger’s car. LE talked to\nYouth A and Youth A reported the facility staff allowed her to walk\naway, and she didn’t want to go back to the facility.\nYouth A was interviewed via phone on 12/17/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported she was in\nbetween the two doors (staff office door and main door) in the\nentryway of the facility. Youth A reported she was irritated\nbecause she wasn’t allowed to play her instrument, so she tried to\nbreak into the staff office door to get her instrument. Youth A\nreported her instrument is one of her coping skills and she felt\nstaff weren’t listening to her. Youth A reported she walked out the\nfront door of the facility. Youth A reported she turned around,\nknocked on the door of the facility, and wasn’t let back in. She\nthen stated she was knocking on the door in the entryway, before\nshe walked outside, and they (Youth A couldn’t remember which\nstaff) wouldn’t let her in. Youth A reported she was banging on it\nhard, and staff left her out there. Youth A reported since they\nwouldn’t let her into the facility, she chose to run away. Youth A\nreported she sat on the playset outside of the facility for a while,\nbut then she started walking away from the facility because she\nwas cold. Youth A reported when she walked away from the\n2",
    "facility, Staff 1 began to follow her in the facility van. Youth A\nreported she got to the end of the road and walked across the\nhighway. Youth A reported she stopped a car on the highway, saw\nit was an elderly couple, and got into their car. Youth A reported\nwhen she got into their car, she saw Staff 1 in the facility van\nacross the highway. Youth A reported she didn’t want to go back\nto the facility, so the couple took her to the police station. Youth A\nreported right after they pulled into the police station, Staff 1 and\nStaff 3 also pulled in. Youth A reported Staff 3 spoke with LE.\nYouth A reported she ran out of the facility three times that day,\nbut the first two times, staff followed her, and she returned to the\nfacility. Youth A reported she eventually got into the facility van\nwith Staff 1 and went back to the facility after she spoke with LE.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 1/10/25 in coordination\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported Youth A was trying to\nbreak into the staff office door from inside the main area of the\nfacility for about 15 minutes in the morning, but then gave up. Staff\n1 reported around lunchtime, Youth A began trying to break into\nthe staff office again. When she was unsuccessful, Youth A\nwalked out of the main door into the entryway of the facility to try\nand break into the other staff office door. Staff 1 reported she was\ninitially making lunch, but when she saw Youth A walk out, she\nwent to assist. Staff 1 reported she and Staff 2 tried to redirect\nYouth A and asked her to come back into the facility, but she\nrefused. Staff 1 reported she was talking to Youth A through the\nmain door of the facility while Staff 2 was talking to Youth A from\nthe staff office door. Staff 1 reported no staff went into the\nentryway to talk to Youth A face-to-face, but she couldn’t explain\nwhy. Staff 1 reported she didn’t leave the door cracked to talk to\nYouth A because she didn’t want other youth getting involved in\nthe situation. Staff 1 reported Youth A banged on the door, and\nwhen Staff 1 opened it, Youth A said, “fuck off”, walked out the\nfront door to go outside and began walking away. Staff 1 reported\nshe grabbed the van keys and began following Youth A. Staff 1\nreported Youth A began cutting through neighbor’s yards, so Staff\n1 tried to keep an eye on her in the yards while she was driving\ndown the road. Staff 1 reported there is a wooded area through\none neighbor’s yard, and it meets up with the highway. Staff 1\nreported Youth A went through the wooded area and went the\nopposite way down the highway. Staff 1 reported it’s a divided\nhighway, and she was unable to follow Youth A in the van\nbecause it was a one-way street. Staff 1 reported she turned right,\nand then used the U-turn Lane to go into the opposite direction\nand continue to follow Youth A. Staff 1 reported she saw Youth A\nget into a stranger’s van, so she followed the van. Staff 1 reported\n3",
    "she called Staff 2 and asked Staff 2 to call the police to let them\nknow what happened. Staff 1 continued to follow the stranger’s\nvan, and they pulled into the police station. Staff 1 reported Staff 3\nmet them at the police station. Staff 1 reported she and Staff 3\ntried to get Youth A to get in the facility van, but Youth A refused.\nStaff 1 reported LE eventually convinced Youth A to get into the\nvan and go back to the facility. Staff 1 reported Youth A never\nbanged on the door to the facility requesting to be let in. Staff 1\nreported Youth A was never locked out of the house with no ability\nto re-enter. Staff 1 reported the side door of the facility is left\nunlocked during the day, and Youth A could have entered the\nfacility on her own at any time. Staff 1 reported Youth A is aware\nof this information because she’s used it multiple times when she\nhas gone outside before.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 1/9/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported she was in\nthe staff office documenting medication distribution for the youth.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A was trying to break into the staff office\nfrom the entryway to the facility. Staff 2 reported she was standing\nat the door and talking to Youth A through the door and looking at\nher through the blinds on the window. Staff 2 reported she told\nYouth A she could use her instrument later but could not right now\nbecause another youth was in crisis. Staff 2 offered Youth A other\noptions she could do instead. Staff 2 reported she didn’t go into\nthe entryway to talk to Youth A face-to-face because if she\nopened the staff office door, Youth A would have gained entry.\nStaff 2 reported she remained in the staff office because, if Youth\nA was successful in breaking the staff office door, Youth A would\nhave had access to unsafe items from the staff office. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 was handling the situation from the other door.\nStaff 2 reported Staff 1 opened the door and asked Youth A to\ncome back inside, but Youth A refused. Staff 2 reported she\nreminded Youth A she could use her instrument later, but Youth A\ndidn’t accept that information and said she wanted her instrument\nimmediately. Staff 2 reported Youth A exited the facility and went\noutside. Staff 2 reported after Youth A walked out, Staff 2 made\nsure the side door to the facility was unlocked, so Youth A could\ncome back inside whenever she wanted. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nnever banged on the staff office door or the main door asking for\nre-entry. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 followed Youth A and called\nshortly later to tell Staff 2 Youth A got into a stranger’s vehicle.\nStaff 2 reported she called the police to inform them what\nhappened, and she was still on the phone with the police when\nStaff 1 and Youth A arrived at the police station. Staff 2 reported\n4",
    "Staff 1 immediately followed Youth A when Youth A left the facility,\nwhich is what their AWOL protocol says to do.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via video conference on 1/10/25 in\ncoordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 3 reported she was\neither in the bedroom hallway or in the laundry room when Youth\nA walked out of the facility. Staff 3 reported she found out Youth A\nleft when Staff 1 grabbed the van keys and said she was following\nYouth A up the road. Shortly after, Staff 1 called Staff 3 and asked\nif she could meet them. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 told her Youth A\ngot into a car with a couple of strangers. Staff 3 got into her car,\nfollowed them, and met them at the police station. Staff 3 reported\n5-10 minutes after arriving, LE arrived and they all discussed the\nsituation. Staff 3 reported Youth A agreed to go back to the facility,\nso Youth A got into the van with Staff 1, and they went back. Staff\n3 reported she can typically reason with and talk to Youth A better\nthan some other staff, so she didn’t understand why the other staff\ndidn’t reach out to her sooner to ask for assistance.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n1/9/25 in coordination with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor\nreported he was not present at the time of the incident, but he was\non call and was called in because Youth A was upset. Supervisor\nreported when he arrived at the facility, he was informed Youth A\ngot into a car with strangers. Supervisor reported soon after,\nYouth A came back and walked into the side door of the facility.\nSupervisor reported he met with her, processed her coping skills,\nand they developed a plan for how to handle things if she became\nupset again. Supervisor reported if a youth leaves the facility, staff\nare to follow them as much as they can, and they should call\npolice if it becomes a dangerous situation. Supervisor reported\nstaff would not have been able to restrain a youth in this situation\nbecause she was not trying to harm herself or others, and going\nAWOL is not a sufficient reason to restrain a youth. Supervisor\nreported he feels staff should have called the police sooner than\nthey did.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 12/14/24 was reviewed from two angles. The\nfirst angle is from the entryway to the facility. Youth A is seen in\nthe entryway trying to break into the staff office door. She is\nthrowing her shoulder against it, kicking it, and pushing it. She has\nsomething in her hand, but it isn’t clear what it is. There are no\nstaff in the entryway with her. She begins touching the main door,\nbut it is unknown what she is doing to the door because her body\nis blocking the camera angle. She put her hand on the handle and\n5",
    "stands there, switches back to the staff office door, and back to\nthe main door. Then she walks out the front door leading outside.\nAt no point does Youth A knock or bang on the door. Since there\nis no audio on the video, no conversations between Youth A and\nstaff can be heard.\nThe second angle is from outside and shows the front door of the\nfacility. Youth A exits the facility and begins walking towards the\nroad. Staff 2 immediately opens the front door, sees Youth A, and\ncloses the front door. A couple minutes later, the facility van is\nseen driving down the road in the same direction Youth A was\nwalking.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• MiSACWIS Incident Report dated 12/14/24 authored by\nChief Administrator states Youth A wanted to play her\ninstrument, and staff told her not right now because there\nwas another youth in crisis. Youth A became upset and\nattempted to use some silverware to break into the staff\noffice. When it didn’t work, Youth A began yelling and\nbanging on the door in the lobby area. Staff (unspecified)\nasked Youth A to put the silverware down and make safe\nchoices, but Youth A ignored staff and went outside. Youth\nA ran towards the highway, running through neighbor’s\nyards, and Staff 1 followed Youth A in the van. Youth A got\ninside a stranger’s vehicle, and Staff 1 followed them. Staff\n1 asked Staff 2 to call the police, so Staff 2 did. Staff 1 and\nthe strangers pulled into the police station. Youth A refused\nto go with Staff 1 until police arrived and convinced her.\n• Adrian Police Department police report #240013956 states\nLE was dispatched in reference to a caller who said they\nhad a youth in their van who was walking on the side of the\nroad with no shoes or jacket. While enroute, dispatch\nadvised they received a call from staff at the facility stating\nYouth A ran away and got into a stranger’s vehicle, which\nthey were following. LE met with everyone in the police\nstation’s parking lot. Youth A told LE staff locked her out of\nthe house and would not let her back in, so she walked\naway.\n• Incident Reporting policy states if a youth leaves the\npremises, staff will search the area and/or maintain\nsupervision at a safe distance. If a youth cannot be located\nfor more than 5 minutes, law enforcement will be notified\nand a missing person report filed.\n6",
    "• Supervision Guidelines state visual supervision will be\nmaintained while in the community unless otherwise\nspecified. While in the general areas of the home, staff will\nprovide visual supervision to ensure safety.\n• Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary records in her\nemployee file. Staff 1 completed policies and procedures\ntraining (5/15/24) as well as supervision requirements\ntraining (10/22/24).\n• Staff 2 does not have any disciplinary records in her\nemployee file. Staff 2 completed supervision requirements\ntraining on 10/22/24.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance based on interviews conducted\nand documentation reviewed. Youth A had an ability to get into the\nfacility through the unlocked side door, which she has utilized\nbefore when she’s been outside. However, she chose to go\nAWOL instead. As soon as Youth A walked away from the facility,\nstaff followed her and continued to follow her even after Youth A\nentered the stranger’s vehicle. Staff maintained visual supervision\nfor Youth A and followed AWOL procedures.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nIf a youth is in the entryway and in distress, staff should ensure\nthey go into the entryway with the youth to provide support face-\nto-face instead of talking to the youth through the doors of the\nfacility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nFebruary 3, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 8, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n7"
