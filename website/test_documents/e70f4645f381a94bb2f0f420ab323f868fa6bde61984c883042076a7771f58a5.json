    "Allegation Youth was refusing to return to the facility from the van and staff\nbuckled the youth onto a gurney and then restrained the youth.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nThe complainant is this consultant as during review of an incident\nreport it was documented Youth A was transported on a gurney\nduring a restraint.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\nDecember 20, 2023. Youth A said she is currently placed at Lotus\nTreatment Program. Youth A said on December 11, 2023, she was\nallowed to go for a walk on campus with Lotus Staff 2 and another\nstaff. Youth A said while on the walk she started to “run to the\nhighway” because she “wanted to get hit by a car”. Youth A said\nshe was restrained by Lotus Staff 2 and the other staff in the grass\nby the road. Youth A said “seven” staff showed up and picked her\nup and carried her to a van and placed her in a seat. Youth A said\nthe staff then continued to hold her while in the van. Youth A said\nonce back at the Lotus Treatment Program building, she got out of\nthe van willingly and immediately attempted to run back towards\nthe road at which time two staff members, she was unable to\nremember who, placed her in a restraint. Youth A said she refused\nto get up and staff were holding her face-up on the ground. Youth\nA said additional staff came over to her with a gurney and lowered\nit to the ground and the staff picked her up and placed her on the\ngurney. Youth A said she was strapped down with “seventeen\nstraps” that were just like seatbelts. Youth A said she tried to get\nout and was able to unbuckle one of the straps, so staff held her\nwhile they rolled her to the unit. Youth A said once on the pod staff\nheld her for “a long time” and then “finally let go” and she got up\nand off the gurney. Youth A said she had never seen a gurney\nused prior to or after that incident. Youth A said she has never\nheard any other youth talking about being placed on a gurney.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\nDecember 20, 2023. Youth B was placed at Lotus Treatment\nProgram on August 28, 2023. Youth B said she has never seen a\nyouth on a gurney while at Lotus Treatment Program.

Youth C was placed at Lotus Treatment\nProgram on November 16, 2023. Youth C said she witnessed\nYouth A being brought into the unit on a gurney. Youth C said the\nstaff lowered the gurney, unbuckled her, she got off the gurney\nand began to beat up a staff. Youth C said this was the only time\n2",
    "she has ever seen the gurney used. Youth C said she has never\nheard of the gurney being used with any other youth.\nHospital Nurse Director was interviewed face-to-face at the\nfacility, on December 20, 2023. Hospital Nurse Director said he\nis the director of Nursing for the hospital and residential programs\nand in that role responds to code calls within those programs.\nHospital Nurse Director said Pine Rest uses “code green” when a\nresident is causing risk to harm themselves or others and the staff\nneed assistance in order to ensure the safety for the resident or\nstaff. Hospital Nurse Director said when code green is called each\nunit within that building will send someone to respond and assist.\nHospital Nurse Director said on December 11, 2023, a code green\nwas called an ambulance bay six. Hospital Nurse Director said as\nhe was running out to the area he saw a staff, who he could not\nremember who, pushing out the gurney. Hospital Nurse Director\nsaid when he arrived Youth A was being physically restrained on\nthe ground between the ambulance bay and the road. Hospital\nNurse Director said staff were offering Youth A to stand up and\nwalk back to the unit or sit and talk to them however she was\nrefusing all offers. Hospital Nurse Director said staff lowered the\ngurney, stood Youth A up, sat her on the gurney, placed her legs\non it, and buckled her on it. Hospital Nurse Director said there are\nfive straps that are the same style as a seatbelt. Hospital Nurse\nDirector said staff continued to have to hold Youth A as she was\nunbuckling the straps and they do not move the gurney unless all\nstraps are buckled for safety reasons. Hospital Nurse Director said\nYouth A was wheeled onto her unit, gurney was lowered, all straps\nwere unbuckled, the staff stood Youth A up and then released her.\nHospital Nurse Director said Youth A was offered a PRN\nmedication by a nurse who she then began to assault. Hospital\nNurse Director said he and all Pine Rest Safety Specialists are\ntrained to use the gurney however it is not something they train\nthe Lotus Treatment Program staff as it is not a tool they would\nuse on their units or without him or the Pine Rest Safety\nSpecialists. Hospital Nurse Director said the gurney is stored in\nthe ambulance bay and not on any unit. Hospital Nurse Director\nsaid a gurney is not standard equipment that is brought to a code\ncall. Hospital Nurse Director said the use of the gurney was done\ncorrectly and a safe method to transport Youth A back to her unit.\nLotus Staff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\nDecember 20, 2023. Lotus Staff 1 said he received a call from\nLotus Director on December 11, 2023, that Youth A was on a walk\nand trying to run into 68th Street. Lotus Staff 1 said he drove to the\narea and upon arrival saw Youth A in a supine restraint in the\n3",
    "grass by the sidewalk. Lotus Staff 1 said Youth A was making\nstatements about wanting to run to the road to be hit by a car.\nLotus Staff 1 said the Pine Rest security guards were present and\nhad the van, so it was decided to have her transported back to the\nLotus Treatment Program building in the van. Lotus Staff 1 said\nYouth A had agreed to get in the van and therefore was released\nbut immediately made an attempt to run to the road and so was\nplaced in a two person standing restraint and staff shuffled slowly\nwhen Youth A was willing to walk to the van where she got in\nwillingly and staff sat on either side of her and held each of her\narms for safety. Lotus Staff 1 denied Youth A ever being picked up\nor carried to the van. Lotus Staff 1 said Youth A was driven back to\nambulance bay six which is a door near Lotus Treatment Program\nunits. Lotus Staff 1 said Youth A continued to make threats about\nrunning to the road as soon as the van doors were opened and so\nthe staff called code green and waited for additional staff to arrive\nprior to opening the van doors. Lotus Staff 1 said staff opened the\nvan doors and Youth A got out with staff close to her and she\nstarted to run and so was immediately placed in a two-person\nstanding restraint however Youth A dropped her weight and so the\nstaff transitioned into a seated restraint. Lotus Staff 1 said a staff\nmember, who he could not remember, brought over the gurney,\nand lowered it down, Youth A stood up with staff on each side, sat\non the gurney and began to resist staff and therefore was held in a\nseated hold as the gurney was positioned in a chair like angle.\nLotus Staff 1 said Hospital Nurse Director and another staff took\nover and were buckling the seatbelts around Youth A and holding\nher to the gurney. Lotus Staff 1 said he walked behind the gurney\nas the other staff and Hospital Nurse Director wheeled Youth A\nback to her unit. Lotus Staff 1 said once in the unit the gurney was\nlowered and seatbelts were unbuckled, and Youth A was released.\nLotus Staff 1 said Youth A immediately began to attack another\nstaff and had to be restrained once again. Lotus Staff 1 said he\nhas never used or seen any other staff use a gurney. Lotus Staff 1\nsaid there is not a gurney stored on Lotus Treatment Program\nunits. Lotus Staff 1 said he has never been trained on the use of a\ngurney. Lotus Staff 1 said from what he observed it was a very\nsafe way to transport Youth A from outside into the unit. Lotus Staff\n1 said he was trained when a youth is outside and refuses to\ncome back inside, to talk to the youth and “wait them out” for a\nlong as you can trying to verbally get them to agree to go back to\nthe unit, and if that does not work or it becomes unsafe to call the\nclinical manager and/or an ambulance depending on the situation.\nLotus Staff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on\nDecember 20, 2023. Lotus Staff 2 said Youth A arrived at the\n4",
    "facility and was on a two-week safety period, then immediately\ninto a seven-day reflection period due to unsafe behaviors and\nhad been doing well for ten days and was off her reflection status\nso staff wanted to do something for Youth A to show her all her\nhard work and good choices was not for nothing. They decided to\ntake her on a walk around Pine Rest property. Lotus Staff 2 said\nshe and another staff took Youth A for a walk to the duck pond and\nwhen it was time to return to the unit, Youth A refused and kept\nsaying she “was not going back”. Lotus Staff 2 said she told Youth\nA she could chose the route to walk back, allowed a few more\nminutes, encouraged her that they would be able to go for another\nwalk another day if they follow expectations and return to the unit,\nhowever none of these tactics worked and Youth A began to walk\nand then run to 68th street. Lotus Staff 2 said she called Lotus\nDirector and told him Youth A was running towards the road. Lotus\nStaff 2 said Youth A continued to proceed directly to 68th street\nsaying she was going to get hit by a car. Lotus Staff 2 and the\nother staff placed Youth A into a standing two-person restraint in\nthe grass next to the sidewalk and road. Lotus Staff 2 said Lotus\nDirector and another staff member arrived to help stabilize the\nhold and Youth A dropped her weight. They transitioned into a\nseated hold. Lotus Staff 2 said she and Lotus Director were talking\nto Youth A and giving her choices to walk to the van or back to the\nunit and Youth A refused and kept saying she was going to get into\ntraffic. Lotus Staff 2 said Youth A willingly stood up and they did a\nreverse walk to the van and placed her in a set and then picked up\nher feet and placed them in the van. Lotus Staff 2 said there were\nother staff that rode with Youth A back to the Lotus Treatment\nProgram building and she was in a different vehicle. Lotus Staff 2\nsaid when they arrived at ambulance bay six Youth A was sitting\nthe van with a staff on either side of her and she was refusing to\ngo into the building. Lotus Staff 2 said Youth A willingly got out of\nthe van but then attempted to get back to the road and was placed\nin a restraint. Lotus Staff 2 said a staff from another unit brought\nout the gurney. Lotus Staff 2 said she was not a part of the\nrestraint at ambulance bay six or putting Youth A on the gurney.\nLotus Staff 2 said she walked behind the gurney as other staff\nheld Youth A and wheeled her back to the unit. Lotus Staff 2 said\nonce on the unit, staff unbuckled the straps and let Youth A stand\nup, at which times she attacked another staff and had to be placed\nin another restraint. Lotus Staff 2 said she has not been trained on\nusing a gurney however it appeared to be a safe way to move\nYouth A from outside back into the unit. Lotus Staff 2 said there is\nno gurney on Lotus Treatment Program units to her knowledge.\nLotus Staff 2 said she has never seen the gurney used and it is\nnot part of the behavior management they use. Lotus Staff 2 said\n5",
    "when a youth is refusing to do something they are asked, they are\ntrained to use verbal de-escalation, process what they are feeling,\nand use QBS transport/escort if they need to move the youth.\nLotus Staff 3 was interviewed via telephone on December 27,\n2023. Lotus Staff 3 said she is a second shift assistant supervisor\nfor Lotus Treatment Program. Lotus Staff 3 said she was driving\ninto Pine Rest on December 11, 2023, for her shift when she saw\nYouth A being restrained next to 68th street by Lotus Staff 2, Lotus\nDirector, and two other staff. Lotus Staff 3 said she stopped to\nassist, and as she was walking over to Youth A, she dropped her\nweight and staff transitioned from a standing two-person restraint\nto a supine restraint on the ground. Lotus Staff 3 said additional\nPine Rest staff arrived for support including the security personnel\nand their van. Lotus Staff 3 said the van was pulled near Youth A\nand she willingly stood up and they escorted her into the van\nwhere a staff sat on either side of her and held her arms for safety.\nLotus Staff 3 denied any staff picking Youth A up and carrying her\nto the van. Lotus Staff 3 said she went back to her own car and\nfollowed the van to ambulance bay six. Lotus Staff 3 said she got\nout of her car and went over to the van and was informed\nadditional staff were coming from the inpatient hospital to assist.\nLotus Staff 3 said Youth A got out of the van and appeared like she\nwas going to walk on her own inside and then attempted to run\nback towards the street at which time she was placed in a\nstanding hold but immediately dropped her weight and was placed\nin a supine hold. Lotus Staff 3 said staff from different units arrived\nand Youth A stood up, sat on the gurney and then Hospital Nurse\nDirector, Pine Rest Safety Specialist, and Hospital Nurse\nSupervisor took over and buckled Youth A to the gurney and held\nher as they wheeled her into the building and on the unit. Lotus\nStaff 3 said she followed and once on the unit the staff unbuckled\nher and allowed her to get off the gurney. Lotus Staff 3 said Lotus\nTreatment Program staff are not trained and do not use the\ngurney. Lotus Staff 3 said it appeared to be a safe way to transport\nYouth A back into the unit. Lotus Staff 3 said training for Lotus\nTreatment Program staff in this situation would be to use verbal\nde-escalation, physical restraints if warranted, wait the youth out\nand attempt to convince her to come back inside, and call the\nclinical manager for support and direction if needed.\nHospital Nurse Supervisor was interviewed via telephone on\nDecember 27, 2023.

    "said she responded to the code green call, along with Pine Rest\nSafety Specialist. Hospital Nurse Supervisor said they brought the\ngurney to ambulance bay six as the call was for assistance to\ntransport Youth A back to her unit. Hospital Nurse Supervisor said\nupon arriving at the incident Youth A was in a restraint on the\nground, attempting to bite and fight against the staff. Hospital\nNurse Supervisor said the staff restraining Youth A got her to stand\nand then sit on the gurney at which time she, Pine Rest Safety\nSpecialist, and Hospital Nurse Director secured the straps on\nYouth A and wheeled her back to her unit. Hospital Nurse\nSupervisor said once on the unit the straps were unbuckled and\nYouth A refused to get up but once she did, she began assaulting\nanother staff and was placed in another restraint. Hospital Nurse\nSupervisor said transporting Youth A on the gurney was a safe\nmethod of moving her especially since Youth A kept trying to drop\nher weight and refuse to walk. Hospital Nurse Supervisor said she\nis trained in the use of a gurney and has used one previously on\nthe hospital wing. Nurse Supervisor said the straps on the gurney\nhave seatbelt buckles on them and anyone can undo the buckles\neasily. Hospital Nurse Supervisor said she has never seen the\ngurney being used at any other time when she has helped on\nLotus Treatment Program units.\nPine Rest Safety Specialist was interviewed via telephone on\nDecember 27, 2023. Pine Rest Safety Specialist said he works in\nthe urgent care section of the building and part of his responsibility\nis to respond and assist whenever a code is called. Pine Rest\nSafety Specialist said he is QBS trained and has training in the\nuse of a gurney. Pine Rest Safety Specialist said a code was\ncalled to ambulance bay six and when he arrived staff members\nhad Youth A placed on her back in a restraint. Pine Rest Safety\nSpecialist said staff were talking to Youth A encouraging her to\nstand up and attempted to stand her up however she was fighting\nagainst the staff and refused to stand. Pine Rest Safety Specialist\nsaid another staff member brought over the gurney and lowered it\ndown next to Youth A and she willingly sat on it, and they lifted her\nlegs and buckled her onto the gurney. Pine Rest Safety Specialist\nsaid the buckles are like seatbelts and are easily undone and\ntherefore staff were holding Youth A onto the gurney by her arms\nand legs in order to transport her safely back to her unit. Pine Rest\nSafety Specialist said once back on the Lotus Treatment Program\nunit the gurney was lowered and the buckles were undone, and\nYouth A got up and began assaulting a staff and was placed in\nanother restraint.

Lotus Director said Youth A was out for a\nwalk on Pine Rest property as a result of being good for about ten\ndays and getting off her reflection status. Lotus Director said he\nreceived a call from Lotus Staff 2 that Youth A began making\nstatements of suicide and began to run to 68th Street. Lotus\nDirector said he and the supervisor of the unit immediately drove\nout to assist in the situation and when they arrived Youth A was in\na two-person standing hold and was attempting to pull the staff\ntowards the road.

Lotus Director said Lotus\nTreatment Program staff are not trained on the use of a gurney as\nit is not part of the behavior management or a tool they would be\nusing. Lotus Director said the gurney is stored in the ambulance\nbay and the Lotus Treatment Program staff most likely do not even\nknow where to find it.
