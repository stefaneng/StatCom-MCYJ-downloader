EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance:\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: One\nCAP submitted was in response to the 2024 interim inspection completed on\n10/10/2024 and the CAP was approved on 11/4/2024. The agency was cited for 3\nviolations, 1 of the violations is a repeat this year. The repeated violation\n(400.12418 -5) indicates that additional corrective action planning is needed to\nshow reduction of this violation.\nA special investigation #2025SIC0000006 was initiated on 10/2/2024. The report\nwas completed on 11/21/2024, and the CAP was approved on 1/14/2025. The\nagency was in violation of rule 400.12421 -1 Visitation and family time: in person.\nThere was not a repeat violation of this rule during this audit.",
    "Chief Administrator Assessment:\nChief Administrator (CA) discussed barriers that impeded the agency this year\nduring the exit conference held on 7/8/2025. CA reported that late signatures\ncontinue to be a challenge due to the time it can take a worker to follow up with\nprinting and signing completed reports, sometimes being a week or more, which\nleads to the report not going with them on home visits and missing the 30 - day\nwindow for obtaining the signatures. She reported the agency has started a new\npractice of supervisors printing and signing reports, and the accompanying\nmedical passports, as soon as they approve them so they can immediately be\nprepared to go on home visits with staff. She is hoping this will assist in the\nreports being signed timelier.\nFinancial Overview:\nReviewed the agency independent auditor’s report dated December 31, 2023, and\n2022, and the agency annual financial report. There were no financial concerns\nidentified.\nStaff Interviews:\nStaff were interviewed onsite 6/11/2025. Staff interviewed were very\ncompassionate about working for the agency citing the assistance, support they\nreceive from the administration, supervisors, and their co-workers. The staff\ninterviewed did not have any concerns. They feel the environment is good to work\nin and that they can go to any department in the agency and get assistance if\nneeded.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through:\nThe agency has the space and equipment needed to fulfil job requirements. The\nfiles are stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one safety alert.\nSafety Alert:\nThe caregiver home is missing a carbon monoxide detector.\nResolution:\nOn 6/24/2025, the Foster Care Worker brought a smoke detector to the caregiver’s\nhome and verified its installation. The Caregiver agreed to ensure its use in the\nhome. Photo is uploaded.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n7/9/2025\n______________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n7/9/2025\n______________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
