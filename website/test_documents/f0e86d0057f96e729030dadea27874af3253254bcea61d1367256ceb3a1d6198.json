A safety plan was implemented to place the\nyouth on separate units.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nProgram Director was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nAugust 12, 2025, and reported they had no additional information.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on August\n27, 2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth A said at\nbedtime on August 10, 2025, she was let into her room by a staff,\nshe could not remember who opened the door, other than it was a\nshort black female, as she walked in and walked away. Youth A\nsaid since the staff had walked away, she was able to prop open\nher door so that it did not latch. Youth A said she intentionally did\nnot latch her door so that she could come out without sounding\nher alarm. Youth A said she came out of her room a few minutes\nlater and saw Staff 1 distracted by paperwork and her cell phone\nso she was able to sneak across the hall. She stood there a few\nmoments to make sure Staff 1 was not watching and Youth B\nopened his door, and she went into his room. Youth A said Youth\nB asked her “are you in here to you know?”, to which she\nresponded, “not really, but do you wanna?”, and Youth B said\n“sure”. Youth A said she and Youth B then proceed to have sex in\nhis bedroom. Youth A said she was in Youth B’s room for about\n30 to 60 minutes before Staff 1 came to do a bedroom check.\nYouth A said she heard Staff 1 opening doors to other bedrooms,\nso she knew that she was doing bedroom checks. She hid around\nthe corner of Youth B’s doorway, so Staff 1 did not see her when\nshe completed the check. Youth A said Youth B then went out of\n2",
    "the room to distract Staff 1 so she could sneak out. Youth A said\nStaff 1 did not see her exit Youth B’s room. Youth A said she was\nvery concerned about getting pregnant, so she decided to tell Staff\n1 what had just occurred. Youth A said after speaking to Staff 1\nshe went to bed. Youth A said she was taken to the hospital the\nfollowing day for medical attention. Youth A said this has never\nhappened previously and staff were not aware of the incident until\nshe told them.\nYouth B was interviewed at Genesee Voices for Children on\nSeptember 3, 2025. I watched the interview via Zoom and\nparticipated by submitting questions while Youth B was being\ninterviewed. Youth B was very hesitant to talk and did not want to\nanswer many questions as he kept repeating “I don’t want to talk\nabout it”. However eventually reported Youth A pushed him out of\nthe way and entered his room. Youth B said he thought Youth A\nwanted to talk with him but then threatened to hurt him if he did\nnot have sex with her. Youth B said he had sex with Youth A and\nthen she left and went back into her room. Youth B said he does\nnot know which staff were working or where they were during the\nincident. Youth B said staff are supposed to check on them when\nthey are in their bedrooms, but staff were not checking that night.\nYouth B said sex was not planned and no staff knew it was\nhappening. Youth B said he eventually told a staff member, he\nwas unsure who, what had happened that night. Youth B said he\nfeels safe now that Youth A has been moved to a different unit.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on August\n27, 2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 said the\nevening of August 10, 2025, was very chaotic with several youth\nbeing outside misbehaving and not following programming. Staff 1\nsaid the youth in the unit were all off schedule for bedtime and did\nnot go to bed until between 8:45pm and 9pm. Staff 1 said she\nplaced all youths in their bedrooms and made sure the doors were\nshut. Staff 1 said Staff 2 had been punched in the eye during the\nincident outside and was “going off”, so she asked her if she\nneeded a 10-minute break since the youth were in bed. She said\nyes and left for thirty to forty minutes. Staff 1 said she was alone in\nthe unit and began to start incident report paperwork for the issues\nthat had occurred outside. Staff 1 said Youth A’s door alarm went\noff and she peeked her head out of her door and was told to go\nback into her room. Staff 1 said Youth A did this three times and\neach time was told to go back into her room. Staff 1 said she\nnever saw Youth A leave her doorway and each time she peeked\nout she was holding her door open so she did not have to go\ndown the hallway to unlock Youth A’s door to let her back into her\n3",
    "room. She did not go down the hallway to make sure Youth A’s\ndoor was shut the last time she told her to go into her room. Staff\n1 said she never saw Youth A exit her doorway and believed she\nwas in her bedroom after the third time peeking out her door.\nStaff 1 said she did not get a chance to start bed checks because\nshe was the only staff on the unit and had to work on paperwork.\nStaff 1 said she completed a room check on Youth A. She was not\nin her room, so she took her DVD player out of her room as youth\nare not allowed certain items if they are not following the rules.\nStaff 1 said the unit cell phone was broken so she did not have a\nway to call anyone to come help her look for Youth A. Staff 1 said\nshe had her cell phone, but it was dead, so she decided to use\nYouth A’s DVD player to charge her phone so she could make a\ncall to Staff 2 or Supervisor. Staff 1 said another youth came out\nof her room and asked to use the bathroom and at the same time\nYouth A came out of Youth B’s room and asked to use the\nbathroom. Staff 1 said Youth A said she needed to talk to her and\nproceeded to tell her that she thought she was pregnant because\nshe and Youth B just had sex. Staff 1 said she asked her if she\nwas serious and she said yes and then she told her she needed to\nreport it and told Staff 2. Staff 1 said Youth A told her that when\nshe had come out of her room she never went back into the room\nand had gone across the hallway into Youth B’s room. Staff 1 said\nYouth B does not have an alarm on his bedroom door due to it\nbeing a trigger for him and most nights he sleeps with his door\npropped open because he is scared of the dark. Staff 1 denied\ntalking to Youth B about the incident and he was moved to\nanother unit for the night. Staff 1 said she could “only do so much\nalone” and did not see Youth A go into Youth B’s room.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on August\n27, 2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 said\nAugust 10, 2025, was a “rough shift” with many youths refusing to\nfollow directions and being outside after the allowed time. Staff 2\nsaid she was hit in the eye by a youth during the incidents outside.\nStaff 2 said she helped Staff 1 get all the youth into their rooms for\nbedtime around 9pm. She spoke to Staff 1 and decided to take a\nbreak in the manager’s office to write incident reports from the\nevening incidents. Staff 2 said she was out of the unit for about\nthirty to forty minutes and came back to the unit briefly and then\nleft again. Staff 2 said she was only gone for a few minutes the\nsecond time and when she returned Youth A, Youth B, and one\nother youth were all out of their rooms, which is unusual as staff\nwill typically only allow one youth out at a time after bedtime. Staff\n2 said Staff 1 walked over to her and stated, “now I have to write\n4",
    "that up”. Staff 2 asked what happened and Staff 1 told her Youth\nA reported she thought she might be pregnant due to having sex\nwith Youth B. Staff 2 said she asked Staff 1 when it happened and\nshe said, “just now”. Staff 2 said she told Staff 1 she would go get\nSupervisor and left the unit.\nStaff 2 said she returned to the unit and asked Staff 1 if she had\nbeen doing bed checks to which she responded she had not\nstarted them yet. Staff 2 said bed checks are supposed to start\nwhen the first youth goes to bed, which is normally 8pm and are to\nbe done at varying intervals not to exceed fifteen minutes. Staff 2\nsaid Staff 1 told her she saw Youth A exit Youth B’s room and\nwhen talking to Youth B he reported that Youth A “forced” him to\nhave sex with her and said she would “hurt him” if he did not\ncomply. Staff 2 said the normal process for bedtime is the youth\nline up by the benches around 8pm. Staff working will walk down\nthe hallway with all of them letting them in their rooms one at a\ntime and ensuring the bedroom doors shut behind them. Staff 2\nsaid each youth, except Youth B, has an alarm on their door so if\nthey open it after being let in the alarm will sound. Staff 2 said if a\nyouth needs to come out of their room after bedtime they are\nsupposed to knock on their door, staff will ask who it is and what\nthey need and then assist them and ensure they are back in their\nroom with the door shut once they have their need met. Staff 2\nsaid she has worked with Staff 1 previously and has never had\nconcerns about her lack of supervision or checks on the youth.\nSupervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nAugust 27, 2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker.\nSupervisor said she was working the night of August 10, 2025,\nwhen she received a call from Staff 2 in a panic. Supervisor said\nStaff 2 told her she returned to the unit and Staff 1 told her that\nYouth A reported having sex with Youth B. Supervisor said she\nasked Staff 2 when this occurred, and Staff 2 said “just now”.\nSupervisor said she made a plan to have Youth B moved to\nanother unit for the night until a more permanent plan could be\nmade the following day with administration involvement.\nSupervisor denied speaking to Youth B directly, however she said\nwhen speaking to Youth A she appeared very remorseful and said\nthe day had been very stressful for her. Supervisor said Youth A\ntold her Staff 1 did not know she was in Youth B’s room.\nSupervisor said the normal procedure for bedtime starts at 8pm\nwhen the youth line up at the benches. Staff working will walk\nthem all down and let them in the rooms one by one, ensuring\neach youth enters their rooms and the doors shut behind them.\n5",
    "Supervisor said the bedroom doors lock automatically behind the\nyouth so no one can go in without a key or the youth opening the\ndoor from the inside. Supervisor said each youth has an alarm on\ntheir door so if they are opened it would sound, except for Youth\nB, as the alarm is a trigger for him therefore, he does not have\none. Supervisor said youth are supposed to knock on their door\nbefore coming out of their room at bedtime. Supervisor said staff\nthen answer them and allow them out and assist them with\nwhatever they need and then make sure they go back into their\nrooms with the doors closed. Supervisor said if the bedtime\nroutine was done correctly, Staff 1 would have heard the alarm on\nYouth A’s door go off when she exited her room and she should\nhave known Youth A’s whereabouts from the time she left her\nroom until she went back into her room.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo footage of August 10, 2025, hallway of McDonald unit\noutside Youth A and Youth B’s bedrooms was reviewed on\nAugust 11, 2025.
