    "Allegation Youth A reported Staff 1 used to look at Youth B naked while she\nwas at the facility in 2021.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility with MDHHS Worker on 4/1/25.\nAdministrator reported Staff 1 does not have discipline in his file,\nnor has there been a grievance filed for this type of behavior in\n2021. Administrator 1 reported in 2021, they had a quarantine\nunit. Any youth who came into the unit would be quarantined for\n14 days before allowed out of their room. Administrator reported\nYouth B was at the facility from 3/4/21-4/27/21: Youth A was at the\nfacility from 2/17/21-4/1/21.\nYouth A reported she was placed at the facility in 2021. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 would look into Youth B’s room and see Youth B\nnaked or wrapped in a towel. Youth A reported Staff 1 knew Youth\nB walked around naked so he would look at her. Youth A reported\nYouth B did this all the time and “invited” attention from Staff 1.\nYouth A reported Youth B never complained to her about Staff 1’s\nbehavior nor told her that Staff 1 was doing this. Youth A reported\nYouth B would walk to the bedroom door naked and Staff 1 would\nopen the door. Youth A reported she was walking around in the\nhallway and would see him looking at Youth B. Youth A was not\nable to provide any more details to these times she alleged Staff 1\npurposely looked at Youth B.\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility with MDHHS Worker on 4/11/25.\nSupervisor reported he has been the supervisor of Staff 1 for the\nlast three years. Supervisor reported he has never had any\ncomplaints or concerns concerning Staff 1’s work performance or\nboundaries. Supervisor reported during quarantine time, there was\na co-ed building, but female staff would work with the female\nyouth and the male staff would work with the male youth.\nSupervisor reported everyone dressed in their own room and\nthere were not “cross-gender” staff checks unless youth were\ntaking too long to get ready. Then the additional staff would come\nwith the other staff to ensure safety.\nStaff 2 reported she worked at the facility since 2017 and was\ninvolved in the quarantine unit in 2021. Staff 2 reported they had\nvery specific protocols due to COVID. Staff 2 reported youth would\nstay in their room unless they completed a shower at night. Their\n2",
    "quarantine would last two to three weeks. Staff 2 reported youth\nwould not be wandering in the hallway. Staff 2 reported male staff\nwere not with the female youth. Staff 2 reported she does not\nremember any youth that would constantly be naked in their room\nor would walk around in their towels in their rooms. Staff 2\nreported if there was someone who was purposely refusing to\nwear clothes they would have had an incident report. Staff 2\ndescribed Staff 1 as a quiet staff. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 and all\nother male staff would not have gone down the female hallways\nduring this time. Staff 2 reported they have a 1:2 ratio. Male staff\nwould sit in the lobby of the building. Staff 2 reported she\nremembered Youth B and did not have any issues with her taking\nher clothes off or always walking around naked or in a towel.\nStaff 1 reported he was employed at the facility in 2021. Staff 1\nreported he did work in the quarantine area. Staff 1 reported\nfemale staff worked with female youth and male staff worked with\nmale youth. Staff 1 reported they would sit at the end of the\nhallway and check the bedrooms every 15 minutes to make sure\nyouth were okay. Staff 1 reported there were always other staff\naround. Staff 1 reported there was not conversations in 2021\nconcerning a female youth walking around naked. Staff 1 reported\nhe never saw a female youth naked. Staff 1 reported that if youth\nwere walking around naked, they would receive a verbal, then\nwritten warning. Staff 1 reported he never looked at Youth B\nnaked. Staff 1 could not remember the names of the female youth\nfrom 2021.\nOn 4/17 and 4/19/25 I attempted to contact Youth B with the last\nknown phone number. There have been no return phone calls as\nof 5/7/25.\nDocuments:\n• Covid-19 Screening Testing and Notification Protocols,\nestablished in 2021 state, “Quarantine is a 14-day protocol\nfor new intakes whose medical status is unknown.”\n• I reviewed the Intake and discharge dates for Youth A and\nYouth B. Intakes and discharge dates are in agreement\nwith Administrator dates provided. The only time frame they\nwere together was from 3/19/21-4/1/21.\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. Staff 1 was hired on\n9/14/09. The last central registry was completed on\n2/24/25. There was no discipline in Staff 1’s file. Staff 1’s\ntraining file is up to date and has completed minimally 25\nhours of training since 2021 to present date.\n• I reviewed Youth B’s treatment plans:\n3",
    "o Youth B preliminary assessment was completed on\n3/15/21 with no concerns noted and it was\ndocumented she was in quarantine with limited\naccess to other youth.\no Youth B’s Initial Treatment Plan was reviewed, dated\n3/25/21. “There have been no notable conflicts with\npeers or staff since placement.”\n• I reviewed Youth A’s treatment plans:\no Youth A’s Initial Treatment plan was completed on\n3/9/21. “Youth A’s interactions with certain staff\nmembers have been highly inappropriate and\ndisrespectful and other times…compliant and\nfriendly.” Youth A had gone AWOL on 3/2/21 and\nhas had time outs and loss of privileges to refocus\non “multiple occasions.” Youth A was noted to\nthreaten physical harm to staff and throw items.\no Youth A’s 35-day assessment was completed on\n3/23/21. Youth A’s behavior has becoming more\nconcerning, and she has become “increasingly\naggressive and defiant…” The report also reports\nshe has been withdrawn and reluctant to talk to the\ntherapist. The report noted her to have “manic”\nbehavior and deemed an “escape risk.” The report\nnoted recommendations for a Trauma-assessment\nto be completed. The report did not note any issues\npertaining to allegations.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Youth B is unable to be\nreached. Youth A’s account of the allegations does not align with\nstaff protocol in 2021. There are no incident reports that confirm\nYouth B refused to dress in her room. All staff and Supervisor\nreported during the time of COVID in 2021, male staff would\nmonitor male staff and female staff would monitor female staff.\nTreatment plans are specific and do not mention any issues with\nYouth B refusing to dress and report Youth A had a difficult time\nadjusting to the facility and increasing aggressive behaviors\ntowards youth and staff during this time. Staff 1 does not have\ndiscipline in his file nor a concerning reputation in supervising\nyouth.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n5/7/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
