Foster Parent X reported\nChild A, who is not a relative, was placed into her home on 6/30/2021, prior to her\nbecoming licensed as a foster parent. The agency called her about Child A’s\nplacement on 6/29/2021. She was surprised by the call, but the agency informed her\nthey were separating Child A and her sister, and they needed a placement for Child\nA. Child A was placed with her on 6/30/2021, not 7/8/2021 which is the actual date\nof her license. The agency provided her with an emergency medical consent\ndocument. The document was dated 6/30/2021 and had Child A’s Medicaid and\nsocial security number on it. She received a foster care replacement checklist with\nthat same date. The agency did not complete all the paperwork for Child A’s\nplacement until 7/14/2021.\nOn 2/2/2022 I spoke with Program Manager 2 onsite, and Director 1 was available\nby telephone, about the complaint. I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) 3, and\nLicensing Supervisor 4 onsite on 2/2/2022. Each of these staff acknowledged that\nChild A is not a relative to Foster Parent X.\n FCW 3 reported Foster Parent X picked Child A up from the agency on\n6/30/2021. Child A’s period of placement with Foster Parent X from\n6/30/2021 until 7/8/2021 “was like respite”. The agency’s licensing\ndepartment spoke with DCWL (Division of Child Welfare Licensing) in\nLansing about the agency’s being able to have Child A placed with Foster\nParent X pending Foster Parent A’s official licensure. FCW 3 said Licensing\nSupervisor 4 could better speak to the placement situation.\n Licensing Supervisor (LS) 4 acknowledged that Child A was placed in Foster\nParent X’s care on 6/30/2021, prior to Foster Parent X’s licensure. LS 4\nadvised that Foster Parent X’s foster family licensing evaluation (DHS- 3130)\n3",
    "package was already with DCWL for review and licensure; and the agency\nattempted to get Foster Parent X’s license expedited. LS 4 called DCWL\nLicensing Consultant 5 to try to execute that process. Licensing Consultant 5\ninformed LS 4 she would pull Foster Parent X’s package to the top for review\nand processing. She contacted DCWL the following day (7/1/2021) and\ndiscovered Foster Parent X’s home had yet to be approved for licensure.\nShe made another contact to DCWL one or two days later but was unable to\nconnect with Licensing Consultant 5 on this matter. She left a message. LS\n4 admitted Licensing Consultant 5 never advised LS 4 or the agency they\ncould make the placement with Foster Parent X. Nor that Child A could be in\nthe home for at least 10 days without licensure. Director 1 informed of that\n“based on her knowledge of the system”. LS 4 stated she felt comfortable\nmaintaining Child A’s placement with Foster Parent X because Director 1\nreported they had 10 days to have the child placed in an unlicensed\nunrelated home. LS 4 reported they did not complete a 3130 A (Children's\nFoster Care Relative Placement Home Study) or Michigan Department of\nHealth and Human Service (MDHHS)-5770 Relative Placement Safety\nScreen, because it was not a relative placement and they had completed a\nfull Initial Foster/Adoption Home Evaluation (CWL-3130) which included\nfingerprint processing/criminal history and children protective services\nchecks. LS 4 acknowledged Child A’s placement shows in MISCAWIS as an\nunrelated placement similar, to an unlicensed relative placement. She\nsurmised that the agency had to put it in the system that way so that it could\nlist the placement.\nLS 4 reported a few days after her last contact to DCWL Foster Parent X’s\nlicense was approved. The dates LS 4 reported as her contacts to DCWL did\nnot appear accurate given the fact that Foster Parent X’s 3130 was not\nsigned by LS 4 until 7/6/2021. LS 4 was initially not clear as to why that was.\nOn 2/10/2021 she advised me via email that the information that was given\nme about the circumstances of Foster Parent X’s licensing/her contacts with\nDCWL was due to her mixing-up of cases and events.\nOn 2/3/2021 I spoke with Licensing Consultant 5. She reported receiving the\ndocumentation for Foster Parent X on 7/8/2021. The agency reported needing it\nprocessed by 7/9/2021. She approved it and issued the license on 7/8/2021.\nShe never provided information to the agency on placing a child with Foster\nParent X prior to licensure; and the agency did not ask her about such. The only\nway she knew that such a placement was possible was via a court order.\nOn 2/9/2022 I spoke with Director 1 about LS 4’s assertion that Director 1 had\nknowledge that the agency could place Child A in a home for 10 days without\nthe person being licensed. Director 1 reported they placed Child A with Foster\nParent X because they had an emergency, and no other foster home for Child A\nat the time. She advised she knew policy would allow that a child could be in a\nrespite/substitute care home for 10 days. She advised, in her opinion, it was\n4",
    "basically them placing Child A with a substitute care provider. Instead of the\nprior foster parent providing that substitute care person, their agency found one\ninstead. She admitted Foster Parent X was not the substitute care provider for\nChild A’s prior foster parent. She did not explore DHHS or other agencies for a\nsearch of a possible license home for Child A. She saw the unlicensed\nplacement as temporary and that it was within policy guidelines.\nDirector 1 advised that the reason Child A was listed in MISACWIS as placed in\nan unrelated caregiver home/ as if Foster Parent X was a relative is because it\nwas entered inappropriately. Program Manager 2 was trying to enter Child A’s\nplacement with Foster Parent X in MISACWIS. Program Manager 2 had the\nincorrect date of 6/30/2021, did not have the full understanding around the\nplacement date, that it should have been 7/6/2021. Program Manager 2 sought\nassistance from the MISACWIS Helpdesk and the Helpdesk somehow aided\nProgram Manager 2 in entering the placement. Thus, both the 6/30/2021\nunrelated care placement and the later Foster Parent X licensed foster home\nplacements are listed.\nOn 2/18/2021 I spoke with DCWL Certification Program Manager 6. I explored\nwhether there was any policy or special way DCWL would allow a placement of a\nchild in an unlicensed home for foster care without that home being a relative.\nDCWL Certification Program Manager 6 was not aware of such; other than by\ncourt order, as reported DCWL Licensing Consultant 5. She recalled a\ncommunication issuance release some time ago which attempted to provide\nclarity on a what is a license foster home and whether a child can be out of such\na placement for more than 10 consecutive days. She provided me that\ncommunication issuance. It is outlined below.\nReviewed\n Child A’s and Foster Parent X’s MISACWIS case records which showed:\n Child A was listed as placed with an “unrelated caregiver” Foster\nParent X on 6/30/2021 until 7/8/2021.\n Child A was listed as placed in a “licensed unrelated foster home” with\nFoster Parent X on 7/8/2021 until 11/10/2021.\n A DHS-69 Action Summary dated 7/9/2021 showing Child A’s\nplacement change from an unlicensed relative home and listing that\nchange as 7/8/2021. This document indicated Child A’s birth parent\nwas notified of the move on 6/30/2021 and the child’s referring worker,\nthe court and LGAL (Lawyer Guardian Ad Litem) were notified on\n7/8/2021.\n Documentation Foster Parent X was provided a copy of Child A’s\nmedical passport on 6/30/2021.\n Documentation that Child A was placed in Foster Parent X’s home “on\nan emergency/respite basis due to the previous relative caregiver not\nbeing willing to care for her any longer. The agency was awaiting\n5",
    "expedited licensure” of Foster Parent X’ s home “at the time of\nplacement”.\n Documentation in Foster Parent X’s MISACWIS screen like a DHS-\n-\n3130A-Children's Foster Care Relative Placement Home Study; and\nMDHHS -5770 Relative Placement Safety Screen are completed\nbeginning 6/30/2021. The documents are listed as approved\n7/14/2021 and 7/3/2021 respectively. Neither document is there.\n Foster Parent X’s Initial Foster/Adoption Home Evaluation (CWL-\n3130) dated 7/6/2021 and approved by the licensing worker and\nLicensing Supervisor 4 on 7/6/2021.\n The DCWL’s Bureau of Information Technology System (BITS) which\nshowed Foster Parent X’s Licensing home study package was received by\nDCWL with an expedited approval request on 7/7/2021. The license was\napproved/opened on 7/8/2021.\n Communication Issuance 17-168- Title Approved Absences from\nPlacement. The document indicated the following as it pertains to licensed\nhomes:\n A foster family home and foster family group home in MCL 722.111\net seq. (Act 116) is care and supervision that is provided 24 hours\na day, for 4 or more days a week, for 2 or more consecutive\nweeks. Previously, this has been interpreted to mean that a child\nmay not be absent from a foster home for 11 or more consecutive\ndays unless placed in a licensed place/placement. This\nCommunication Issuance serves as clarification that MCL 722.111\net seq. (Act 116) does not limit the time that a child may be absent\nfrom placement, but instead provides the statutory definition of a\nfoster family home and foster family group home. Therefore, the\nfollowing guidance is being issued to clarify timeframes and\nrequirements regarding a child’s absence from placement.\n An instance which a child can be in an approved absence from\ntheir placement that does not require placement changes or\ncapacity changes to licensed foster homes include Substitute\nCare, which is short term care and supervision for a foster child in\nthe absence of the caregiver. Substitute care is driven by the\ncaregiver’s need for substitute care. The substitute care provider\ndoes not need to be a licensed provider. If the substitute care\nprovider is a licensed provider, a capacity change does not need to\noccur.\n The approval path for the absence from placement cannot\noverride or interfere with the child’s case plan or court-ordered\nrequirements, such as parenting time. The provider must notify the\ncaseworker prior to the absence anytime a child will be out of their\nplacement 3 or more days. In addition, the child’s LGAL and\nparents (for temporary wards) should be informed of planned\n6",
    "absences. Licensed foster homes must follow substitute care\nlicensing rule R 400.12319 and provide notification to the agency\nbefore the beginning of any planned overnight substitute care and\nwithin 24 hours of any unplanned absence requiring substitute care\nfor 24 hours or more.\n Absences of 3 to 5 days do not require approval beyond the\ncase worker. The placement must be considered intact; and\nagree to remain actively involved with the child and/or his\nfamily during the absence. The child’s placement is not\nchanged in MISACWIC, and payment may continue if the\nplacement is maintained, and the child’s return to the\nplacement is planned.\n Absences of 6 to 14 days require the foster care supervisor’s\napproval. The placement must be considered intact by the\nprovider and return to the placement is planned. The child’s\nplacement is not changed in MISACWIC, and payment may\ncontinue if the placement is maintained, and the child’s return\nto placement is planned.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12404 Placement.\n(1) An agency shall only place a child with an adult who is\nlegally related to the child, is a legal custodian, or in a\nlicensed foster home, except as permitted in R 400.12709.\nANALYSIS: The agency placed Child A in an unlicensed unrelated home for\neight days pending the home’s licensure. The placement was\nagainst rule and policy standards. It did not meet the possible\nexception of absence from placement in a substitute care\nprovider home as outlined in the communication issuance\nclarification; because there was no plan for Child A to return to\nher prior foster home/care provider.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency did not provide all known medical information to the foster parent.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/27/ 2022 I spoke with Foster Parent X by telephone. Foster Parent X reported\nthe agency did not share all known information to her about Child A on 6/30/2021.\nShe did not know Child A had medical problems, that would require extensive medical\nappointments with doctors and physical therapists. The agency made it seem as if\nChild A’s case was easy. The agency advised that Child A was living with her sister\nin an aunt’s home; and because of some behavioral issues that were coming up\n7",
    "between the girls they needed to separate the siblings. The agency told her Child A\nwas age four, but behaved like a two-year-old, who has a bad temper. On 7/14/2021\nthe agency provided her with more information about Child A’s needs. The agency\ntold her Child A needed physical therapy, speech therapy, and then they said she\nneeded more services and required weekly visitation with Child A’s mother. Foster\nParent X reported this was her first time fostering and she did not know all that\nfostering would entail. She acknowledged she was oriented to the agency’s foster\ncare program, and she attended PRIDE training. She said, fostering became\noverwhelming, affected parenting of her own child; and so, she requested Child A’s\nremoval from her home. She said the removal occurred on 11/10/2021.\nOn 2/2/2022 I spoke with Program Manager 2 onsite, and Director 1 was available\nby telephone, about the complaint. I interviewed FCW 3, and Licensing Supervisor\n(LS) 4 about the allegations onsite on 2/2/2022.\n FCW 3 reported that on 6/30/2021 Foster Parent X was provided Child A’s\nmedical passport, Emergency Medicaid card and the agency’s on call\ncontact number. Additionally, on 6/30/2021, FCW 3 and LS 4 spoke with\nFoster Parent X regarding Child A’s case. They informed Foster Parent X\nof several appointments Child A has to attend, inclusive of the dentist, and\nthe referrals for occupational and physical therapy, which would then\nrequire attendance at those services: and an assessment for therapy.\nThe foster parent understood from what was shared it meant that Child A\nwould require ongoing appointments and services. On 6/30/2021 Child A\nalso had an office visit with her mother and sister; and the agency had the\nChild A’s mother to share information with Foster Parent X related to Child\nA’s likes/dislikes and what encourages Child A. FCW 3 reported she also\nspoke specifically with Foster Parent X about the time and commitment\nfostering Child A would require. Foster Parent X agreed to the placement\nand initially had no concerns with caring for Child A. FCW 3\nacknowledged there came a time that Foster Parent X expressed concern\nwith all that was involved in fostering Child A. Those concerns came after\nthe school year started. At that time, Child A as well as Foster Parent X’s\nown child school were physically back in school (they were not as\nrestricted as prior due to COVID). Foster Parent X became frustrated by\nChild A’s continued appointments, all that came with fostering, Foster\nParent X’s life activities, and her children ongoing commitments. Foster\nParent X missed several physical therapy appointments for Child A. The\nagency arranged for some transporting for Child A to appointments and\nassisted with dental appointment scheduling. Additionally, LS 4 met with\nFoster Parent X on more than one occasions to provide support to Foster\nParent X.\nFCW 3 gave me a copy of the information she provided Foster Parent X. This\ninformation was inclusive of:\n8",
    " The agency’s Foster Care Re-Placement checklist dated 7/8/2021(which\nFoster Parent X had also provided), signed by a case worker and supervisor\n(neither signature was legible) as well as the foster parent for 7/14/2021. The\ndocument also indicated the reason for Child A’s placement in care;\nadditionally, why Child A was being replaced; and her educational and\nmedical needs, while listing speech, occupational and physical therapy\nneeds; along with behavioral and emotional issues and a therapy referral.\n A Placement Outline and Information Record (DHS-3307), ( that Foster\nParent X had also provided) which indicated Child A’s previous placements,\nknown siblings first names; known history of abuse/neglect; physical\nconsiderations (around illnesses, health problems, medications, allergies, etc.\nthis section mentioned Child A’s speech delay, and possible developmental\ndelay); emotional issues and behaviors (inclusive of “tantrums, crying,\nscreaming, and refusing to go somewhere”) and other known information\nwhich might be helpful related to Child A. This document also outlined\nservices to be provided within the next 30 days, and indicated speech,\nphysical and occupational assessments, and scheduling. Also, listed was the\nneed for dental cleaning and examine. This document listed Child A’s\nplacement dated as 7/8/2021 and was signed 7/14/2021 by the same parties\nas the Foster Care Re-Placement document.\n LS 4’s reporting about this allegation was similar to FCW 3’s reporting. She\nreported they told Foster Parent X about Child A’s special needs, speech\ntherapist needs; and that Child A may need additional services because Child\nA was not getting all she needed in her prior placement. Foster Parent X\nspoke with Child A’s mother about Child A’ special needs. Foster Parent X\nwas clearly aware of services Child A needed and what more may be\nrequired in the future because of those needs. LS 4 reported as they got\nmore information on services for Child A that information was relayed to\nFoster Parent X.\nReviewed:\n The Placement Outline and Replacement checklist as indicated within this\nreport.\n MISACWIC case record for Child A which showed information as reported by\nFCW 3 and LS 4 pertaining to the information and discussion with Foster\nParent X about Child A’s history and needs.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12417 Foster parent information.\n(1) An agency shall provide a foster parent with all of the\nfollowing information before the placement or replacement\nof a child:\n(c) Available known information about the child’s health.\n9",
    "(h) Any other known information to enable the foster\nparent to provide a stable, safe, and healthy environment\nfor the foster child and the foster family, including\ninformation about siblings who do not reside in the foster\nhome.\nANALYSIS: The foster parent admitted that she was provided initial\ninformation about Child A on 6/30/2021 and more extensive\ninformation about Child A needs on 7/14/2021. Evidence\npresented by the agency staff and case records showed Foster\nParent X was provided information related to Child A’s known\nhistory at the time, inclusive of information about Child A’s\nhealth, and other know information which would enable the\nfoster parent to provide Child A and the foster family a safe,\nstable, and healthy environment.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency failed to report suspected abuse.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/27/2022 I spoke with Foster Parent X by telephone. Foster Parent X did not\ngive details on this allegation. She reported FCW 3 failed to make a protective\nservice report when the child said her mom touched her, “poo poo,” (vagina), and\nthat she was whipped by her former foster mother Ms. N. Foster Parent X did not\nreport when these allegations were made to FCW 3.\nFCW 3 denied the allegations. She said Foster Parent X never disclosed a time that\nChild A reported Child A’s mom touched her “poo poo”. Nor that a past foster parent\nwhupped Child A. FCW 3 reported there was a time Foster Parent X called to say\nChild A said someone touched Child A’s leg, but not specifically who, when or where\nthat happened. Foster Parent X then began grilling Child A with questions. FCW 3\nrecalled a report from Foster Parent X went from someone touching Child A’s leg to\nChild A allegedly indicating FCW 3 drove Child A to her mom’s. That while at the\nmom’s Child A had gotten dirty and inappropriate touching happen then. FCW 3\nadvised she was at that visit with Child A. Child A had gotten dirty and Child A’s\nmother gave her a bath. FCW 3 was at the door, nothing inappropriate occurred.\nFCW 3 advised that one of the reasons connected to Child A’s replacement from\nChild A’s prior foster care placement was because that caregiver was being\ninvestigated by children services. The caregiver requested Child A’s and Child A’s\nsister’s immediate removal, which lead to Child A’s placement with Foster Parent X.\n10",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12214 Compliance with 1975 PA 238.\nAn agency shall develop a written plan and implement the\nplan to assure compliance with 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.621,\nand known as the child protection law.\nANALYSIS: The foster parent did not provide detail information about the\nallegations. The agency denied such allegations being made to.\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the allegations or a\nfailure to report to children services.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe foster parent was not paid for a period of days in July 2021; and did not receive\nthe DOC as the agency told her she would.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 1/27/ 2022 I spoke with Foster Parent X by telephone. Foster Parent X\nreported she was not paid a $5.00 per day DOC (Difficult of Care) rate for Child A\nwhich was to start 7/14/2021. Foster Parent X reported not knowing about a DOC, or\nthat Child A was eligible for such until FCW 3 told her. FCW 3 told she was\napproved for the DOC. Foster Parent X inquired about the payment several times.\nEventually the agency told her they don’t handle DOC’s, DHHS (Department of\nHealth and Human Services) must approve it. She reported, sometime after\nNovember 2, 2021, she put everything in a letter about the lack of payment and she\nasked for Child A’s removal from her home. She never received the DOC rate for\nChild A. Nor did she know whether she was ever approved for such a rate. I\nexplained DOCs, why and how rates are approved/paid by the department. Foster\nParent X continued to state the agency told her she was approved.\nFoster Parent X also reported not being pay for fostering days of 7/8/2021 through\n7/31/2021. She reported having a few telephones and or email conversations with\nthe agency about this. She spoke or communicated with FCW 3, LS 4, Foster Care\nSupervisor (FCS) 7 and another person she was referred to (whom she couldn’t\nrecall). Sometime in August 2021, the agency advised her they didn’t have a vendor\nnumber for her, and she emailed that to them. However, another person, whom,\nFoster Parent X didn’t identify told her that was not reason she had not received the\ncheck. Sometime in October she was told the check was deposited into her bank\naccount. When she advised she never received the funds, the agency said the\ncheck was mailed, and it was showing as not cashed. She was advised, she needed\nto request a replacement check. She reported this matter is still unresolved and her\nlast contact with that agency about it was in early November 2021. Foster Parent X\nreported complaining about this matter to the department now because the agency\n11",
    "made a complaint against her license, and is seeking to revoke her license, when\nthese are things, the agency did not do.\nOn 2/2/2022, I spoke with Program Manager 2 onsite, and Director 1 was available\nby telephone. I interviewed FCW 3 and LS 4 about this allegation onsite on\n2/2/2022 as well.\n Program Manager 2 and Director 1 advised the agency was informed by\nFoster Parent X sometime in September 2021 that Foster Parent X did not\nget her July 2021 foster care payment. Program Manager 2 advised the\ncheck for the July 2021 payment was sent out on 8/5/2022; and it was\napparently not cashed. The agency requires that the foster parent sign an\naffidavit to assert that they did not receive the check. Foster Parent X has\nrefused to do so several times. The last discussion with Foster Parent X\nabout this occurred sometime in November; and the agency was waiting for\nFoster Parent X to come sign the document. Program Manager 2 reported\nthat as it relates to Foster Parent X not receiving a DOC there was an issue\nwith Foster Parent not signing the child’s treatment plan. She said, FCW 3\nwould be better able to speak to this issue.\n FCW 3 reported what Program 2 had relayed pertaining to Foster Parent X’s\nmissed check in the mail; and Foster Parent X needing to sign an affidavit.\nFCW 3 spoke more to the issue of the DOC. She denied telling Foster Parent\nX that Child A was approved for the DOC. Nor did she represent it as if it was\na done deal. She discussed the process and criteria for requesting a DOC.\nShe let Foster Parent X know what would make Child A eligible; that it has to\ndo with extra care Foster Parent X has to provide and show; and that DHHS\nmust approve the DOC. She said she went over the DOC document with\nFoster Parent X. DHHS did not approve the DOC request because the\ncurrent Parent Agency Treatment Plan Agreement (PATPA) at the time\n(7/17/2021) did not reflect what was being reported. Additionally, Foster\nParent X had refused to sign that PTAPA and did not sign the October 2021\nPATPA. Foster Parent X was not understanding that she needed to comply\nwith those things. FCW 3 tried explaining to DHHS why the paperwork was\nnot lining up. In mid-October 2021, FCW 3 was communicating with and\napprising Foster Parent X of what more was needed from Foster Parent X for\nthe DOC to be get processed and hopefully approved. DHHS’s hadn’t\nofficially denied the DOC, but it had not been approved either. FCW 3\napprised Foster Parent X that in order for the agency to re-request the DOC,\nFoster Parent X needed to sign the new DOC document and the last two\nPATPAs. Foster Parent X stopped communicating with the agency and\nnothing more could be done on the DOC matter. Child A entered a new\nfoster home on 11/10/2021.\n LS 4 addressed the foster car payment aspect of the allegation. She reported\nwith regards to Foster Parent X not receiving payment for 7/8/2021-\n12",
    "7/31/2021, Foster Parent X had a check that was lost. FS 4 tried to help get\npayment for Foster Parent A, because Foster Parent X had done the agency\na favor by taking Child A into her home. Foster Parent X worked with them\nwhen Child A’s prior placement was refusing to take Child A back. However,\nFoster Parent X refused to sign an affidavit that the check was lost, that she\ndid not get the payment. The agency’s finance office could not do anything\nfurther without the affidavit. LS 4 and the agency’s finance representative\nmade a further attempt to resolve this issue. They had a virtual meeting with\nFoster Parent X via Zoom on 11/2/2021 to go over this matter as well as\nplacement concerns. Foster Parent X committed to come the agency on\n11/10/2021 to sign the affidavit. Foster Parent X did not show up. She had\nverbally requested Child A’s removal on 11/2/2021, but the agency was trying\nto still work with her and accommodate some her transportation requests.\nFoster Parent X wanted the agency to commitment to providing transportation\nfor Child A’s appointments for the next month. When the agency was unable\nto do that, Foster Parent X basically, left Child A at the agency on 11/10/2021.\nFoster Parent X refused to come get Child A after her parenting time; and\nrefused to respond to the agency’s call. The visit ended at 3:00pm and Foster\nParent X did not contact the agency back until 7:00pm. She refused to take\nChild A back. Thereafter, Foster Parent X has not taken further action related\nto the missing check. Foster Parent X has not been cooperative with contact\nfrom the agency due to a special investigation which had be initiated due to\nher action of refusing to take Child A back, and not working with the agency\nwith respect to their prior attempts to conduct her renewal inspection. The\nagency is open to sending her a certified document to sign related to the lost\ncheck.\nReviewed\n A Foster Care Payment form sign by the agency and Foster Parent X on\n7/14/2021. This document indicated Child A’s rate as $17.24 per day.\nAdditionally, that a DOC form was due on or before 8/8/2021; and as a foster\nparent she would receive a general rate until such time that DHHS stamps a\nDOC.\n A September 14, 2021, email from FCS 7 to the agency’s accounts payable\ndepartment advising that Foster Parent X did not receive the month of July\n2021 payment. Also, a responding email that a check was sent Foster Parent\nX on 8/5/2021, #149399 for $ 413.76. Additionally, that the check had not\ncleared the agency’s bank account. An affidavit was offered to be sent.\n Other email communications related to this matter for October and November\n2021; inclusive of a 11/2/2021 email from Foster Parent X requesting Child\nA’s removal from her home, and the July payment.\n An unsigned Stop Payment Affidavit completed for Foster Parent X\n13",
