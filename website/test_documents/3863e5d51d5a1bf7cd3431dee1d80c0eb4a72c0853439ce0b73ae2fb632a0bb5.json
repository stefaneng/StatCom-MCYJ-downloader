    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4101 Definitions.\nAs used in these rules:\n(ii) \"Social service worker” means a person who works\ndirectly with residents, their families, and other relevant\nindividuals and who is primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for\nthe resident. The definition does not prevent a team approach\nto service plan development and implementation.\nThe social service worker’s duties are not aligned with the definition of a\nsocial service worker in the rules.\nUpon review of two CMO treatment reports, it became evident the Supervisor\nof Direct Care Workers (Program Manager) also functions as the social service\nworker at the facility. The Supervisor of Direct Care Staff coordinates all youth\nservices, attends court hearings, arranges home visits, makes all of the social\nwork contacts and documents them in JAIS, and works directly with residents,\nfamilies, and the referral source. The assigned Social Service Worker\n(Support Coordinator), however, has other responsibilities within the agency\nthat are unclear. It appears the Social Service worker only signs CMO reports\nand has little to no involvement with the youths.\nTechnical Assistance: The job description for Supervisor of Direct Care Staff\n(Program Manager) which was revised in June 2018 does not accurately reflect the\ntype of children served. The person the supervisor reports to is outdated in the\ndescription. These should be updated.\nR 400.4104 Rules compliance.\n(2) After being licensed, an institution shall, on an ongoing basis,\ncomply with the act, child caring institution rules, and terms\nof the license.\nIt was discovered the facility has been providing short-term residential services\nfor several years, but the terms of their license does not allow for this. If the\nagency wishes to continue providing short-term (respite) services, they must\nsubmit a new application requesting a change in the terms and follow up with a\nrevision to their program statement.\n1",
    "R 400.4111 Job description.\nAn institution shall provide a job description for each staff\nposition that identifies rules, required qualifications, and lines of\nauthority.\nGenesis House opened in 2014. The job description for Social Service Worker\n(Support Coordinator) was developed by Spectrum Community Services in\n2008 and was based on the agency’s adult foster care homes. A new job\ndescription for Social Service Worker that identifies duties, lines of authority\nand qualifications consistent with child caring institutions and CCI licensing\nrules needs to be developed.\nR 400.4123 Education.\n(2) Provision shall be made for an appropriate education program\nin accordance with 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1853. Each\nresident of school age shall be enrolled not later than 5 school\ndays after admission and continuously thereafter.\nOne of one open treatment file did not indicate that the youth was enrolled in\nschool within 5 days after admission. The youth was admitted on 9/13/21 and\nenrolled sometime in October 2021. There was no documentation indicating\nthe date of enrollment or any barriers preventing timely enrollment in school.\nR 400.4147 Dental Care.\n(2) A dental examination within 12 months prior to admission\nshall be documented or there shall be an examination not later\nthan 90 calendar days following admission.\nOne of one open treatment file did not have documentation\nthat a dental examination was completed within 12 months\nprior to admission or 90 days after admission.\nR 400.4153 Shelter care and detention institutions; preliminary service\nplans.\nWithin 7 calendar days of admission, a plan shall be developed\nfor each resident. The plan shall include all of the following:\n(a) The reason for care.\n2",
    "(b) An assessment of the resident’s immediate and specific\nneeds.\n(c) The specific services to be provided by the institution.\n(d) Other resources to meet the resident’s needs.\nThe facility discharged three short-term youth in 2021 and has no short-term\nyouth currently. I read one closed file. One of one closed short-term file did\nnot contain a preliminary service plan which was due within 7 days of the\nchild’s admission.\nTechnical Assistance – Upon interviewing the Social Service Worker (Support\nCoordinator), she said she was not aware that the three youths admitted for short-\nterm programming were designated “short-term.” She also was not aware that “short-\nterm” youth require a preliminary service plan within 7 days of admission. If the\nfacility wishes to continue a short-term program, the Social Service Worker must be\ntrained on the short-term service plan requirements. *Note – At the last inspection,\nthe agency was advised to develop and utilize a preliminary service plan template.\nR 400.4113(g) Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each employee\nand shall include documentation of all of the following information\nprior to employment or at the time specified in this rule:\n(g) If the employee has criminal convictions, the institution\nshall complete a written evaluation of the convictions that\naddresses the nature of the conviction, the length of time since\nthe conviction, and the relationship of the conviction to regulated\nactivity for the purpose of determining suitability for employment\nin the institution.\n3",
    "One of one new employee did not have verification that her ichat was reviewed\nby the agency prior to hire.\nTechnical Assistance – To determine if further evaluation is needed, the institution\nmust analyze all ichats, first to determine if there were any arrests and then to check\nfor convictions. If there are no criminal convictions, the person conducting the\nanalysis should date and initial the ichat to verify they checked and there were no\nconvictions. If there are convictions, the remaining requirements in subsection (g)\nshould be followed.\nR 400.4113(i) Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each employee\nand shall include documentation of all of the following information\nprior to employment or at the time specified in this rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of\nhuman services, the equivalent state or Canadian\nprovincial agency, or equivalent agency in the country\nwhere the person usually resides, that the person has\nnot been determined to be a perpetrator of child abuse\nor child neglect. The documentation shall be completed\nnot more than 30 days prior to the start of employment\nand every 12 months thereafter.\nOne of one new employee hired in June 2021 does not have verification that\nshe is not a perpetrator of child abuse or neglect. No DHHS Central Registry\nClearance was obtained.\nRepeat Violation: 12/23/2020 LSR with approved CAP 01/08/2021\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each employee\nand shall include documentation of all of the following information\nprior to employment or at the time specified in this rule:\n(j) A written evaluation of the employee's performance within\n30 days of the completion of the probationary period or within\n180 days, whichever is less, and a written evaluation of the\nemployee’s performance annually thereafter.\n4",
    "One of one new employee hired in June 2021 did not have a performance\nevaluation upon completion of the agency’s probationary period.\nRepeat Violation: 12/23/2020 LSR with approved CAP 01/08/2021\nR 400.4119 Social service worker; qualifications.\nA social service worker, at the time of appointment to the\nposition, shall possess a bachelor's degree with a major in a\nhuman behavioral science from an accredited college or\nuniversity or another major with 25% of credits in human\nbehavioral sciences.\nThe Social Service Worker (Support Coordinator) hired in June 2021 does not\nqualify for the position. She does not have a degree with a major in human\nbehavioral science or 25% of credits in human behavioral sciences. The\nagency did not seek DCWL consultation prior to hiring her.\nAs of January 12, 2022, the Chief Administrator confirmed that the Social\nService Worker (Support Coordinator) will no longer perform social service\nwork functions at Genesis House.\nTechnical Assistance- I reviewed the Supervisor of Direct Care’s (Program\nManager) diploma and transcripts. She has a bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice\nand meets the qualifications of Social Service Worker. As indicated above, the\nSupervisor has already been performing the bulk of the social service worker’s duties.\nIf it is agreeable to the employee and the agency, I suggested the Supervisor officially\nhold both roles.\n2.) This is not a MDHHS-contracted facility and therefore is not required to comply with\nISEP.\n3) This is not a MDHHS-contracted facility and therefore is does not have any contract or\npolicies obligations.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n1) How to provide verification that ichats were examined appropriately.\n2) How to determine if a candidate qualifies for a position.\n3) How to fill out a new CCI application requesting a change in terms.\n4) How to determine if and when a dental exam is needed for a youth.\n5",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n1) Option to add short-term programming to the terms of the license, and what this\nentails.\n2) Recommended changes to job descriptions\n3) Need for Chief Administrator to coordinate with and train Spectrum’s Human\nResources Department on the CCI rules relative to employees\n4) Recommended Chief Administrator consult with DCWL to assist in verifying\nqualifications of any new potential candidates prior to hire.\n5) Recommended the facility be appropriately reclassified as a child caring institution\nversus a therapeutic group home, which involves submitting a new application.\n6) Recommended staff be trained how to complete a body check and that body\ncharts be completed on all youth upon admission\n7) Provided the proposed new CCI rules to Chief Administrator with some\ninterpretation\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care or corporal punishment\nduring this licensing period.\nThe facility had no violations stemming from investigations or requiring corrective\naction plans during this licensing period.\nThe following rules were cited in the Renewal Report of 2020:\nR 400.113 Employee records (i) & (j)\nR 400.4120 Supervisor of direct care workers; qualifications\nR 400.4128 Initial staff orientation and ongoing staff training\nR 40.4166 Discharge plan\n6",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the facility continue on their regular license.\nJanuary 19, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 20, 2022\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n7"
