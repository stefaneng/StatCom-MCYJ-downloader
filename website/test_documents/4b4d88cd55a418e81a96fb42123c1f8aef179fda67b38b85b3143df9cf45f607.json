Foster Parent 1 reported she has two children\nthat resided in her home as foster care children until July 2024\nwhen they were adopted by her. They are hereafter referred to as\nAdoptive Child A and Adoptive Child B. Adoptive Child A and\nAdoptive Child B are part of a large sibling group.

Foster\nParent 1 reported that sibling visits would occur at the home of\nRelative A and she would transport Adoptive Child A and B to and\nfrom the visits. Foster Parent 1 reported on one occasion when\nshe picked up Adoptive Child A and B from a sibling visit at the\nhome of Relative A her children smelled of marijuana. Foster\nParent 1 reported this occurred sometime in April 2024, and she\nwas concerned about minors smoking marijuana in the home.\nFoster Parent 1 reported Adoptive Child A and B both reported to\nher that marijuana use is occurring in the home.

    "in this report. Foster Parent 1 reported when Sibling A entered the\ncar he smelled heavily of marijuana. Foster Parent 1 also reported\nSibling A smelled strongly of cologne which she believed he was\nusing to hide the smell of marijuana.\nFoster Parent 1 reported during a May 1, 2024, Family Team\nMeeting (FTM) she raised her concerns about marijuana use in\nthe home of Relative A and she did not want any further sibling\nvisits to occur in Relative A’s home and suggested they occur in\npublic places or at her home. Foster Parent 1 reported Staff 1, the\nSaginaw DHHS foster care worker for Relative A’s home and the\nfoster children who reside there, responded that he has not\nwitnessed marijuana use in the home of Relative A and therefore,\nit is not a concern. Foster Parent 1 further reported Staff 1 had\nsaid he had never smelled marijuana or seen it’s use when he\nwould conduct visits. Foster Parent 1 reported she felt her\nconcerns were not being treated seriously by Staff 1 or the\nProgram Supervisor who was also present at the FTM.\nThe agency Program Manager was interviewed via Teams\nMeeting on 04/02/2025. Program Manager reported she was not\naware of the concerns raised by Foster Parent 1 during the\n05/01/2024 FTM. Program Manager reported the Program\nSupervisor and Staff 1 attended the 05/01/2024 FTM as there was\nfriction between Foster Parent 1 and Relative A regarding sibling\nvisits and the agency wanted this resolved in order for sibling\nvisits to occur with regularity. Given the concerns raised by Foster\nParent 1 during the 05/01/2024 FTM, Program Manager was\nasked should a complaint have been filed with Central Intake.\nProgram Manager confirmed twice that a complaint regarding\nsafety concerns in the home of Relative A should have been\ncalled in to Central Intake. Program Manager reported that\nsomething does not have to be observed in order to file a\ncomplaint. Program Manager used sexual abuse as an example\nthat would not be observed but would warrant the filing of a\ncomplaint if allegations arose. Program Manager was asked if a\nsafety plan was developed for the home of Relative A and she\nresponded she was not aware of one.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via Teams Meeting on 04/02/2025.\nStaff 1 reported he is the foster care worker for Foster Child 1, 2,\nand 3, all of whom reside in the home of Relative A.

    "in the home. Staff 1 reported Relative A uses marijuana but does\nnot use it in the home and around the children. Staff 1 reported\nthe foster children in the home have never reported marijuana use\nin the home. Staff 1 reported he had no reason to suspect\nmarijuana use was occurring in the home. Staff 1 was asked that\ngiven what Foster Parent 1 was reporting, should that information\nwarrant the filing of a complaint with Central Intake. Staff 1\nresponded since he had never smelled or observed marijuana use\nin the home the decision was to create a safety plan instead of\nfiling a complaint with Central Intake. Staff 1 was asked to submit\nthe safety plan to this consultant, but reported he did not have it,\nand Program Supervisor should have it and referred her for that\ndocument.\nCase Manager was interviewed via telephone on 04/02/2025.\nCase Manager works for Family Community Services, a private\nagency, and is the foster care worker assigned to the home of\nFoster Parent 1.

Caseworker reported\nthat Program Supervisor asked her at the FTM if she was\nconcerned about marijuana use in the home of Relative A and she\nconfirmed that she was, Caseworker reported she asked Program\nSupervisor if anything was going to be done about the reported\nmarijuana use and Program Supervisor responded they do not\nhave those concerns therefore this would not be followed up on.\nCase Manager reported Program Supervisor then stated she and\nStaff 1 would create a safety plan.\nProgram Supervisor was interviewed via Teams Meeting on\n04/02/2025. Program Supervisor is the supervisor for the Saginaw\nCounty DHHS foster care program and is the supervisor of Staff 1.\nProgram Supervisor reported she attended the 05/01/2025 FTM in\nan effort to resolve friction occurring between Foster Parent 1 and\nRelative A. Sibling visits had been interrupted for a short period of\ntime and the agency wanted them to continue regularly. Program\nSupervisor reported the agency has never had any concerns\nabout Relative A and remarked she is an incredible relative\nparent. Program Supervisor reported she felt that Foster Parent\n1’s allegations were retaliatory against Relative A. Program\nSupervisor was asked that based upon Foster Parent 1’s\nconcerns about the home of Relative A should a complaint have\nbeen called in to Central Intake. Program Supervisor responded\n4",
    "that it seemed that Foster Parent 1 was making those allegations\nto “get back” at Relative A. Program Supervisor also reported\nconcerns about the foster children having to go through an\ninvestigation and that it would not be good for them. Program\nSupervisor was asked about a safety plan, and she did not know\nof one.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\nFOSTER CARE FILE:\n• Family Team Meeting: A Family Team Meeting dated\n05/01/2024 was reviewed.
