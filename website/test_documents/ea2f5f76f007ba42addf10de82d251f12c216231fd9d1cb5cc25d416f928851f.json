    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nAgency relocation. 3681 Okemos Rd., Suite 500, Okemos, MI 48864\nIII. Methodology\nOnsite visit completed on 11/13/2018.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe new location consisted of a waiting room area, reception area, common work\narea, and individual offices, storage areas, conference room and private visitation\nareas for the provision of services. The agency was located in a business/office\ncomplex that was easily accessible and accessible by public transportation. Both\nthe complex and the agency offices appeared to be relatively new and well\nmaintained. The agency rooms were clean, attractive and well lit by both natural\nlight and commercial lighting.\nThis agency location and resources appear to be more than adequate to provide a\nquality level of services to the children and families served by this agency.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend the new location be approved and identified in the established\ninformation system as the current location of services by this agency.\n11/27/2018\n________________________________________\nMark R.
