INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Education\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4123\nSection (2) Provision shall be made for an appropriate education program\nDescription in accordance with 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1853. Each\nresident of school age shall be enrolled not later than 5 school\ndays after admission and continuously thereafter.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency is not providing proper education.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 8/5/2024 DCWL Program Manager received information from\nComplainant regarding concerns that youth at Havenwyck were\nbehind in credits due to not following the Michigan Merit\nCurriculum. In addition, youth at the facility did not have Individual\nEducation Plans (IEPs) as required. Complainant further reported\nthe school on-site at the facility was not registered as a non-public\nschool and did not use the public school system. The facility did\nnot hold regular credit reviews to ensure youth had the proper\namount to graduate timely and the program did not graduate\nyouth. Due to these concerns a complaint was also filed with\nMichigan Department of Education (MDE). Due to the\ninvestigation with MDE, Program Manager determined the\ninvestigation by DCWL would be completed once MDE\ndetermined their findings.\nComplainant reported to DCWL via email on 10/7/24 that MDE\nextended their investigation through the end of the month. It was\nclarified that the MDE investigation was focused on the local\nschool district and their role in providing education to the youth at\nthe facility.\nEducation Analyst was contacted on 11/13/24 and reported the\nMDE investigation was complete. Education Analyst stated the\nlocal school district was found in violation and placed on a\ncorrective action plan due to special education students not\nreceiving a proper education at the facility. Education Analyst\nstated they continued to have concerns that the facility was not\nfollowing Michigan Merit Curriculum for youth to receive credits\n2",
    "and graduate. Education Analyst reported that it was their\nunderstanding that the school at Havenwyck did not issue\ndiplomas at graduation. When youth left the program, they needed\nto have their new school complete the audit and issue a diploma.\nMDE Education Consultant was contacted via email on\n11/26/25. Education Consultant confirmed that youth at the facility\nwere enrolled in Havenwyck School, which was a non-public\nschool. The MDE investigation corrective action plan required a\nplan to provide all eligible current and future students with\ndisabilities a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) as\nrequired under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(IDEA), which includes completion of IEPs. Meetings were\nscheduled between MDE, Havenwyck, and DCWL to discuss\nplans to ensure the required education was provided.\nMeetings occurred on 12/11/24, 12/17/24, and 1/7/25 with Chief\nAdministrator, Education Consultant, Havenwyck Chief\nExecutive Officer, DCWL, and local public-school administration.\nIt was discussed that youth at the facility were enrolled in a private\nschool. However, due to youth being placed in foster care, they\nwere required to receive the same benefits as public school\nstudents. Due to a reported misunderstanding of the type of youth\nplaced, the local school district was not completing IEPs or\nproviding services. Teachers at Havenwyck school were not\nspecial education certified to provide those services. When youth\nwere discharged from the facility, they received a transcript. If\nyouth finished school while at the facility, they could not graduate\nas the school was not accredited. In addition, youth only attended\nschool from 7:30-11:30AM, which was not sufficient to meet\neducational requirements by MDE. It was determined the facility\nwould explore online education programs through a public school\ndistrict, in order to meet requirements. The local school district\nand facility staff collaborated to determine which youth needed a\ncurrent IEP. It was determined the facility would begin to utilize an\naccredited online school in collaboration with the Intermediate\nSchool District (ISD), in order to begin providing education to\nyouth that met FAPE and IDEA requirements.\nChief Administrator was interviewed face-to-face at the facility\non 1/8/25. Chief Administrator reported the facility did not have the\nproper special education services in place, due to the local school\ndistrict not providing the proper support. Chief Administrator\nreported the school district lost several support staff and did not\ncomplete IEPs as needed. Chief Administrator stated they had\nfrequent communication with the school district regarding their\n3",
    "needs. However, the school district was not responsive. Chief\nAdministrator clarified that the teachers at the facility were\nHavenwyck employees, not teachers associated with a school\ndistrict.\nTeacher 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/8/25.\nTeacher 1 reported they struggled to work with the local school\ndistrict, to coordinate services. The school district frequently did\nnot have paperwork updated to send with youth when they left the\nfacility and enrolled in another school. Teacher 1 reported the\nschool district had never been in compliance with IEPs and none\nhad been completed. Teacher 1 stated they complete enrollment\nforms and document the need for IEPs, then send the information\nto the school district. However, the school district never followed\nup with requests by the facility. Teacher 1 reported the school at\nthe facility was a non-public school. Teacher 1 stated they did not\nhave any issues with credits transferring to other schools.\nTeacher 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/8/25.\nTeacher 2 reported they worked with the local school district to\nenroll youth and request IEPs. However, the school district did not\ndo their part, as determined by the MDE investigation. Teacher 2\nstated they had frequent communication with the school district\nregarding needs for the youth, but the district never responded.\nTeacher 2 was aware that Chief Administrator also reached out to\nthe district to request a meeting to develop a more cooperative\nrelationship, but the district did not respond. Teacher 2 provided\ndocumentation of enrollment forms and emails to confirm they\ncompleted the enrollment process as required.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Email dated 2/27/24 between Education Analyst and\nDistrict Teacher Consultant. The District Teacher\nConsultant confirmed youth at the facility would receive\nnon-public Service Plans, not IEPs.\n• Emails between Teacher 1 and the school district from\n1/30/24, 2/7/24, 3/20/24, 4/8/24, 9/5/24, and 9/11/24 were\nreviewed. Teacher 1 notified the district of youth enrollment\nforms that were submitted and requested IEP/service plans\nfor youth.\n• Education records for youth placed at the facility were\nreviewed and determined school enrollment forms were\ncompleted by Havenwyck and provided to the school\ndistrict within five school days of admission.\n• A list of youth from the facility identified eight youth\ncurrently in need of an IEP.\n4",
    "• MDE complaint 24-0188 decision dated 10/20/24. The\ninvestigation concluded the school district failed to fulfill its\nobligation to the students at the facility. Information from\nthe decision, relevant to the DCWL investigation included:\n• Havenwyck’s on-site school was determined to be a\nprivate school, located in the boundaries of Oakland\nSchools Intermediate School District (ISD).\n• The ISD noted ten students in need of educational\nservice plan reevaluations during the 2022-2023\nschool year.\n• Multidisciplinary Evaluation Team report was\ninitiated for each student. However, the reports were\nnot completed. In addition, the reports identified the\nyouth’s MDHHS caseworker as the parent/guardian.\nHowever, the definition of a parent prohibits the state\n(MDHHS) from serving as the IDEA parent for\nspecial education decision making purposes. If the\nchild is a state ward, a parent or appointed surrogate\nparent, must be involved in IDEA.\n• The district identified eleven students as having\nbeen referred to the district for the 2023-2024 school\nyear. Registration for the students was completed on\n10/4/23.\n• There was no documentation to support that the\nschool district completed comprehensive\nreevaluations for students at Havenwyck during the\n2023-2024 school year.\n• There was no evidence to indicate the ISD provided\nany assistance or support to the school district to\nensure that students at Havenwyck’s private school\nwere evaluated or provided FAPE.\n• MDE complaint 24-0190 decision dated 10/20/24. The\ninvestigation concluded the following:\n• None of the students at Havenwyck were enrolled in\nthe private school by a parent. All students were\nunder the care and custody of MDHHS. Therefore,\nnone of the parentally placed private school\nstudents’ provisions apply.\n• The district treated the private school students as\nparentally placed with respect to Child Find and the\nprovision of equitable services. However, Child Find\nefforts were incomplete as no evaluations were\ncompleted during the 2023-2024 school year.\n• MDE Office of Special Education “failed to ensure\nthat the educational programs at the (Havenwyck)\n5",
    "private school were under the general supervision of\nMDE”.\nAnalysis A violation was found as the facility utilized an on-site private\nschool for youth in care. Licensing rules require compliance with\n1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1853, which states that students\nwith disabilities placed by a public entity (MDHHS), need to be\nenrolled in a public school that provides a Free Appropriate Public\nEducation (FAPE) and follow all special education laws. As\nstudents at the facility did not receive a public education, students\nalso did not receive special education services and Individual\nEducation Plans.\nTechnical Assistance\nTechnical assistance was offered that in the future should the\nlocal school district not respond, Havenwyck should contact the\nMichigan Department of Education in order to ensure youth\nservices are put in place timely.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n_ _______________February 4, 2025___________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 5, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
