No\nresponse to this date.\nOn 10/24/24, I spoke to Administrator 1. She reported there is no\nvideo footage of this incident, nor any grievance or incident report\nfor the alleged incident.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 11/25/24 face to face at the facility. Staff 1\nreported she completes “wake up” on Pod F. Staff 1 reported she\nknocks on their bedroom doors and turns the lights on for them.\nShe provides them time to get up. If they do not wake up, then she\ncan open the door and go into the room to wake them up. Staff 1\nreported she rarely has to go into the youth’s room to wake them\nup. Staff 1 reported on this particular day, 10/18/24, Youth A\nrefused to get up. Staff 1 opened the door, went in, and stated it\nwas time to go to school.

Then she used the palm of her hand and smacked\n2",
    "him across the face. Youth A reported he didn’t say anything to\nStaff 1 to provoke her to smack him. Youth A reported Staff 1 and\nhimself argue a lot and do not get along so maybe that is why she\nsmacked him. Youth A reported he has never seen her hit anyone\nelse.\nOn 12/19/24, I interviewed Youth B face to face at the facility.\nYouth B reported Staff 1 works in the unit during the pods wake up\ntime. Youth B reported he has never seen Staff 1 hit Youth A.\nYouth B reports during wake-up time, she turns the lights on and\nknocks on the door.

Youth C\nreported in the morning she tells everyone to get up and turns on\nthe light. Youth C reported he has never seen her hit any of the\nyouth.\nI interviewed Manager at the facility on 12/19/24. Manager walks\naround the facility and makes sure the facility is managed\nproperly. Manager reported she has never had any complaints\nconcerning Staff 1, nor heard that she has smacked any youth in\nthe facility. Manager reported Youth A does make up accusations\nwhen he does not get his way.\nDocuments:\n• I reviewed the agency Behavior Management Policy. It\ndoes not allow smacking youth.\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. All clearances and\ntraining are up to date.\n• There are no incident reports or grievances for this\nsituation.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. There is no evidence to\nvalidate the allegations.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "Rule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv) Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth's\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that staff call the youth at the facility derogatory\nnames.\nInvestigation I interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 11/24/24. Staff 1 reported\nshe has never named called any youth in the facility and has\nnever heard any other staff name call the youth.\nOn 12/19/24, Youth A was interviewed face to face at the facility.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 has called the youth, “Bitches.” Youth A\nreported other staff name call as well but was unable to provide\nnames.\nOn 12/19/24, I interviewed Youth B, face to face at the facility.\nYouth B reported he has heard Staff 1 yell at Youth A and has\nheard her call Youth A “Bitch” and a “Nigger” one time.

Manager\nreported she has never heard from anyone that Staff 1 uses\nprofanity with the youth.\nI interviewed Staff 2 face to face at the facility on 12/19/24. Staff 2\nreported she has only worked with Staff 1 a few times. Staff 2\nreported Staff 1 is a newer staff and will sometimes be quick to\nreact and raise her tone with the youth but has never heard Staff 1\nuse profanity with the youth. Staff 2 reported she has not heard\nother staff use profanity with the youth.\n4",
    "I interviewed Staff 3 face to face at the facility on 12/19/24. Staff 3\nreported Staff 1 is nice, not timely, and she needs help with her\n“temperament.” Staff 3 explained that Staff 1 has used profanity at\nthe kids and in conversation with the kids. Staff 3 reported when\nthe youth become escalated, she also becomes escalated and\nstarts to cuss and yell at them. Staff 3 reported she helped train\nStaff 1 and did not see this temperament then but after her\ntraining was completed. Staff 3 reported she had to redirect her a\ncouple of times for using profanity. Staff 3 reported she would\nlisten, but at times provide an attitude to her. Staff 3 reported she\nhas heard Staff 1 use the word “Nigger” towards the youth. Staff 3\nreported she has heard her say, “Shut the fuck up.” Staff 3\nreported she has heard Staff 1 use profanity in general, not\ntowards the youth but just in conversation. Staff 3 reported she\ndid not report this to anyone because everyone needs a job right\nnow.\nDocuments:\n• Staff 1 has completed 66 hours of training and her “Shadow\nTraining Forms.\n• I requested Staff 1’s supervision forms. Supervision forms\nwere not completed. Please see below additional finding.\n• I reviewed the agency’s behavior management policy. The\npolicy does not allow verbal abuse.\nAnalysis The agency is in violation with this rule. Youth A, Youth B, and\nStaff 3 all reported they have heard Staff 1 use derogatory names\ntowards the youth. Staff 3 worked with Staff 1 and reported she\ndid have to redirect her conversations. Staff 3 reported Staff 1’s\ntemperament was something Staff 1 needed to work on,\nespecially when the youth would escalate. Staff 2 reported Staff 1\nwould react quickly and raise her tone. This coincides with Staff\n3’s interview as well.\nTechnical Assistance: Child safety is the responsibility of all staff\nin the facility. Staff 3 reported she had been aware of Staff 1’s\nlanguage and name calling with the youth, but did not report this\nto anyone. These are situations that, if known, the facility could\nhave provided a support to Staff 1 by providing additional\nsupervision or training. The agency is to ensure that all staff\nunderstand professionalism and the mission of the facility. The\nagency (as an example) may address this in policy under\nprofessionalism or ethical behavior.\n5",
    "Consultation: The agency may want to address culture and\nteamwork in team meetings or in supervision to ensure all staff are\naware of their responsibility to the youth they serve.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2025SIC0000031 dated 1/7/2025; CAP Pending\nSIR 2024SIC0001654 dated 9/13/2024; CAP Pending\nSIR 2024SIC0001352 dated 7/24/2024; CAP Approved\n1/27/2025\nRule Code Chief Administrator: responsibilities\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4116\nSection (1) An agency shall assign the chief administrator responsibility\nDescription for the onsite day to day operation of the institution and for\nensuring compliance with these rules.\nViolation Additional Findings\nType\nAllegation The chief administrator did not ensure previous corrective action\nplans (CAPS) were being implemented, resulting in non-\ncompliance.\nInvestigation Administrator 2 reported Administrator 1 has been terminated\nfrom the chief administration position. It was discovered that there\nwere areas of her job responsibilities not being completed.\nAdministrator 2 reported they are working on a CAP binder to\nensure they complete CAPS. Administrator 2 reported when these\nCAPS were written, the facility did not have the manpower to\nachieve this type of supervision. Administrator 2 reported they\nhave hired case managers, and this now could be done.\nDocuments:\n• I requested Staff 1’s supervision forms on 12/26/24 1/7/25,\n1/9/25, and 1/16/25. The agency did not have these forms.\n• I reviewed SIR CAP 2023C000854 and SIR CAP\n2023C0000650. CAP 2023C0000650 documented the\nagency would start 1 on 1 supervision with all staff (at all\nlevels) on a weekly basis. This would be implemented on\n10/2/23. CAP 2023C0000854 documented the agency\nwould move from weekly supervision to bi-weekly\nsupervision for all staff. This would be implemented on\n3/23/24.\n6",
    "Analysis The agency is non-compliant with this rule. The agency was not\nimplementing CAPS they had created.\nTechnical Assistance: Policies and job descriptions are to be\nupdated to reflect supervision changes outlined in the previous\nCAPS. The agency is to assess what is feasible concerning\nsupervision of all personnel. More frequent supervision may occur\nfor newer staff and then less frequent as they grow into their\nposition. The previous CAPS signed by Administrator 1 are to be\nreviewed by the facility and implementation ensured.\nConsultation: it would benefit the agency to create a CAP binder\nincluding all CAPS and placing all documentation mentioned in the\nCAPS, in the binder. It would also benefit the agency to have\nroutine CAP meetings to discuss the current CAPs in place, the\ncompliance with those CAPS, and an assessment of the changes\nin the facility the CAP may have produced. All parties responsible\nfor the implementation should be present to ensure all parties\nknow about the CAP.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2025SIC0000217 dated 1/9/2025, CAP Approved 1/27/2025\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n1/31/25\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
