In this file the youth\nhad a change in placement 06/27/2021 and the documentation required for this\nchange was completed 07/13/2021.\n2",
    "R 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(1) An agency shall develop service plans with the child, the\nchild's parents or legal guardian, the referring agency, and the\nother parties involved in providing needed services, or medical\ncare, unless the agency documents why any of the entities have\nnot been involved.\nTwo of the three current foster child records reviewed did not have adequate\ndocumentation that the entities identified in this rule were involved in the\ndevelopment of the service plans. In the first file there was no Parent Agency\nTreatment Plan to document this involvement for the time period 05/25/2021 –\n08/20/2021. In the second foster care child record there was no Parent Agency\nTreatment Plan to document this involvement for the time period 05/11/2021-\n08/03/2021.\n2.)

There were also a number\nof other completed reports that were located that did not include worker and\nsupervisory signatures.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED (Previously cited Interim 01/06/2021)\nCAP Approved 01/27/2021.\n3.)
