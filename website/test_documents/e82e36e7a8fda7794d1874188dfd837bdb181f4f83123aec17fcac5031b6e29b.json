Chief Administrator said they have had Youth A in placement since May 2021.\nChief Administrator said since onset of placement Youth A has had ongoing\nconcerns with self-harm, suicidal ideation, assaults, destruction of property,\nundressing and exposing herself to other youth, and attempting to AWOL. Chief\nAdministrator said recently Youth A’s behaviors have increased after another youth\nin her house ingested perfume and was hospitalized and then spent six days in an\nemergency placement. Chief Administrator said Youth A began to mimic the\nbehaviors of this other youth making statements about ingesting glass, cleaner, and\nother materials in attempts to get hospitalized as well. Chief Administrator said\nYouth A began breaking things around the house to ingest and breaking into the\noffice to get items to hurt herself in determination to be brought to the hospital. Chief\nAdministrator said due to Youth A’s self-report that she had swallowed different\nobjects she had to be brought to the emergency room for evaluation. Chief\nAdministrator said Youth A was always sent back to Eagle Village and not\nhospitalized. Chief Administrator said due to these increased incidents it was\ndecided a new behavior support plan needed to be developed to keep Youth A safe.\nChief Administrator said the Program Director, Therapist, house supervisor, foster\ncare worker, GAL and herself were involved in the development of the behavior\n2",
    "support plan and the Judge for Youth A was also made aware of the plan for Youth\nA. Chief Administrator discussed the expectations of Youth A with the new behavior\nsupport plan, which is noted in the section “documents” below. Chief Administrator\nsaid Youth A had an increase in behaviors at first however they have seen a\ndecrease in her issues recently and she is showing progress. Chief Administrator\nsaid since being on the current behavior support plan Youth A has finally been able\nto start sleeping in her own room without issue and has started to disclose\ninformation on past traumas. Chief Administrator said they have tried to use many\nother tools and plans to support Youth A however due to her increased behaviors\nthey felt the new behavior support plan was the only way to keep her safe at this\ntime. Chief Administrator said the new behavior support plan went into effect on\nNovember 24, 2021, and Youth A was still in an obsessive state of self-harm which\nled to the restraints on November 25, 2021. Chief Administrator said staff were\nupdating her daily over the Thanksgiving weekend and she was aware of the\nrestraints on November 25, 2021, as well as the concerns/progress Youth A had\nover the weekend on the behavior support plan. Chief Administrator said she,\nProgram Director, Therapist, house supervisor and Youth A have reviewed the\nbehavior plan three times between November 24, 2021, and December 7, 2021, with\nanother review set for today (12/7/21).\nProgram Director was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on December 7,\n2021. Program Director said Youth A has been in the program since the spring and\nhas had many concerns since that time. Program Director said since October 1,\n2021, Youth A has had 26 assaults to staff/peers, 30 suicide incidents, 7 sexually\ninappropriate incidents, and 17 out of bound/property damage/medical refusal\nissues. Program Director said Youth A’s team has tried many different tools with\nYouth A to provide her support and treatment since her placement. Program Director\nsat in on the interviews with Chief Administrator and Therapist and in speaking with\nher afterwards she agreed with the information they both provided as far as Youth\nA’s history while in the program and current needs for the behavior support plan.\nProgram Director also confirmed she understood all licensing rules for when\nrestraints are to be utilized.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on December 7, 2021.\nTherapist said she has been assigned to work with Youth A since May 27, 2021.\nTherapist said since Youth A arrived, she has shown extreme behaviors and will\ndysregulate from 0 to 100 in seconds. Therapist said since placement at Eagle\nVillage Youth A has broken windows on building and vehicles, assaulted peers and\nstaff, self-harmed, disrobed and ran around campus, and attempted to AWOL.\nTherapist said recently, Youth A has shown an increased desire to self-harm and\nhas become more impulsive. Therapist said Youth A does not have a “traditional\nlook of dysregulation” and therefore it is more difficult for staff to see when Youth A\nis triggered. Therapist said along with this concern and her impulsivity staff have\nstruggled to intervene prior to Youth A beginning to self-harm. Therapist said the\nnature of self-harm has also increased for Youth A as she has tried to drink cleaner,\nperfume, swallow glass or other objects. Therapist said Youth A has been brought to\n3",
    "the hospital several times for ingesting cleaner for the white board at school, saying\nshe swallowed glass, and other self-harm behaviors and each time has been\nevaluated and will change her story therefore sent back to Eagle Village. Therapist\nsaid previously they have tried other coping methods with Youth A such as a\nweighted blanket, slime, or other tools however Youth A’s behaviors have increased\nand her willingness to use her coping tools have decreased. Therapist said based on\nthe extremeness and impulsiveness of her behavior is the reason why it was\ndecided Youth A needed a more intense behavior support plan. Therapist said the\nplan was discussed with her, Chief Administrator, Program Director and then shared\nwith the foster care worker and the GAL who both were in support of the behavior\nsupport plan for Youth A. Therapist said the behavior support plan is intended to\nkeep Youth A safe, break the negative behaviors that Youth A has established, learn\nher own triggers of distress or negative feelings, and help Youth A realize the staff\ncan keep her safe from herself. Therapist said the behavior support plan has Youth\nA sitting at the table doing activities throughout the day such as therapy sheets,\ncoloring, or crafts, with build in breaks to go on a walk and have time in her\nbedroom. Therapist said Youth A’s bedroom was “stripped” of anything unsafe and\ndoes not need to be searched prior to her going into her bedroom for her break.\nTherapist said there is a meeting at least weekly with the house supervisor, Chief\nAdministrator, Program Director, Youth A and herself to discuss the safety plan and\nhow Youth A is progressing and slowly opening Youth A’s plan up to her being on a\nnormal schedule with the other youth and off her plan. Therapist said in her opinion\nthis has been a successful safety plan for Youth A. Therapist said since the safety\nplan has been in place the incidents with Youth A have decreased, her ability to\nregulate herself without restraints has increased, and Youth A is beginning to open\nup about her past traumas. Therapist said Youth A is involved in the meetings and\nhas shown progress during the meetings being able to participate and ask for\nadditional items she would like back. Therapist said Youth A made a disclosure\nabout past sexual abuse and she was able to stay self-regulated throughout the\nentire shift which was “huge” for Youth A. Therapist said she believed the safety plan\nwould only be needed a couple of weeks in order to get Youth A to a place where\nshe could be back on the normal house schedule. Therapist said despite the normal\nrules regarding restraint, she felt Youth A needed this plan in order to keep Youth A\nsafe.\nI participated in the behavior support review meeting with Youth A face-to-face\non December 7, 2021. Prior to the meeting, Therapist and Program Director\nreported to me, Youth A has a pattern of becoming dysregulated and ultimately often\nrestrained after being interviewed by DCWL or other DHHS employees. Therefore, it\nwas decided I would participate in the review of the behavior support plan in order to\nobtain information from Youth A in a safe setting that would not trigger increased\nbehavioral issues for her. Youth A presented well-groomed, in clean clothing, with a\npositive mood. Youth A said she was on the safety plan due to swallowing glass,\nspiting/biting/hitting others, and hurting herself with anything she can find. Youth A\nsaid she is trying every day to “do better”, ask permission before doing things, and\nthink about her actions before just “doing them”. Youth A said she did get in a hold\n4",
    "recently for threatening to hurt herself and staff but then went back to her seat at the\ntable and played games with staff. Youth A said she is learning not to hurt herself\nand staff and said she “likes myself when I am being good” and she feels good\n“because people treat me respectful”. Youth A said she feels happy and wants to\nstart doing more “stuff”. Youth A said she used to spit on staff, hurt herself or others,\nand is having decreased incidents at this time. Youth A said she thinks sitting at the\ntable is working to help her stay safe. Youth A said she feels she needs a “safe\nspace” and things she should continue to have “table time” but that she wants to do\nother activities with her peers as well.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face via TEAMS on December 15, 2021. Staff\n1said she was working on November 25, 2021. Staff 1 said Youth A said she wanted\na break in her room and per the safety plan she is allowed to do this but needs to be\nmonitored. Staff 1 said she told Youth A that she needed to wait for a bit before\ngoing to her room so that they could get the staffing in place. Staff 1 said Youth A\nwent down to her bedroom without permission and making threats to self-harm while\nwalking down the hallway. Staff 1 said she followed Youth A to her room and Youth\nA began banging her head on the wall. Staff 1 asked for assistance and Staff 2 and\nStaff 3 came down the hallway to help. Staff 1 said she then went to watch the other\nyouth. Staff 1 said she did not see what happened during the restraint. Staff 1 said\nYouth A is on a safety plan where she is to stay at the table and only can get up with\nstaff permission, otherwise she is to be put in a restraint. Staff 1 said she was\ninformed of the safety plan from Therapist and the house supervisor. Staff 1 said the\nsafety plans are also in a staff binder which the staff review, date and sign, as well\nas verbally shared with staff.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face via TEAMS on December 15, 2021. Staff 2\nsaid she does not normally work in the same house as Youth A but was picking up a\nshift on November 25, 2021. Staff 2 said she was told about Youth A’s safety plan by\nhouse supervisor, Therapist, read it in the house binder, and was sent an email with\nYouth A’s plan. Staff 2 said she came out of the bathroom and was called down to\nYouth A’s bedroom by Staff 1 because Youth A was in the bedroom without\npermission and refused to leave her room. Staff 2 said she attempted to talk with\nYouth A and get her to go back down to the table however Youth A refused, stood\nup and ran up the ladder to the top bunk in her room. Staff 2 said she told Youth A to\ncome down, but Youth A refused. Staff 3 began to climb the ladder and Youth A\nstarted to swing her fists and spit on Staff 3. Staff 2 said Staff 3 was able to get\nYouth A off the top bunk and she and Staff 3 put Youth A in a safety seated position.\nStaff 2 said Youth A was headbutting, kicking her legs, and spitting during the\nrestraint. Staff 2 said during the restraint she and Staff 3 were talking Youth A\n“down”. Staff 2 said Youth A headbutted her in the mouth and so she switched out\nwith Staff 1 and went to check her mouth in the bathroom. Staff 2 said when she\ncame back from the bathroom Youth A was calm and she walked back to the table\nto her seat. Staff 2 said she verbally reminded Youth A she needed to be seated at\nthe table unless she has staff permission to get up. Staff 2 said about fifteen minutes\nafter Youth A had sat down, she got back up from the table without staff permission.\n5",
    "Staff 2 said she told Youth A to sit down, and she did not so Staff 2 restrained her,\nwalked Youth A back to her seat, and Youth A sat back down. Staff 2 said the\nrestraint was done due to Youth A’s safety plan stating that if Youth A gets up from\nthe table without permission she is to be restrained. Staff 2 said she does not know\nwhy Youth A has even stood up at that time but did not resist the restraint and\nwillingly sat back in her seat. Staff 2 said she has not worked with Youth A since that\ndate.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face via TEAMS on December 15, 2021. Staff 3\nsaid he is the up-night supervisor and was on call on November 25, 2021 and was\nworking in Youth A’s house from 5pm-9pm that evening. Staff 3 said he is aware of\nYouth A’s safety plan and was told about it during a supervisor meeting on\nNovember 24, 2021. Staff 3 said he was in the house when all the staff and youth\ncame back from dinner. Staff 3 said Youth A went down to her room, came back,\nand then went back to her room. Staff 3 said he was called down to Youth A’s\nbedroom by Staff 1 and when he arrived Youth A was sitting on her bed. Staff 3 said\nStaff 2 came down to Youth A’s bedroom as well. Staff 3 said he and Staff 2 were\ntalking with Youth A but she just kept getting louder and louder and then got up from\nthe bottom bunk and moved to the top bunk. Staff 3 said he was not sure if Youth A\nhad anything on the top bunk that could pose a safety risk and so he began to climb\nthe ladder behind Youth A. Staff 3 said Youth A spit on his face and began to hit\nStaff 2. Staff 3 said he and Staff 2 each took one of Youth A’s arms and got Youth A\ndown and she dropped weight and went to the floor and was struggling. Staff 3 said\nStaff 2 had Youth A in a seated safety position and Staff 3 was on Youth A’s legs.\nStaff 3 said Youth A headbutted Staff 2 in the face and so he switched and took\nYouth A’s arms and Staff 2 went on Youth A’s legs. Staff 3 said he had a tight hold\non Youth A, so she was unable to headbutt him. Staff 3 said prior to the restraint\nthere were many attempts to verbally deescalate Youth A however she kept “amping\nback up”. Staff 3 said Youth A began to become aggressive with hitting and kicking\nwhich is what lead to the restraint. Staff 3 said he was in the house but not in the\nkitchen/dining room during the second restraint with Staff 2 and Youth A.\nDuring the interview with Staff 3, he mentioned Youth B is “on the same type of plan”\nas Youth A. Staff 3 said that Youth B is also expected to sit at the table for “table\ntime” due to her safety plan.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Behavior Support Plan for Youth A created on 8/23/2021 which is as follows:\no Purpose: Youth A has poor boundaries with staff and her peers. It\nappears she uses sexual behaviors to have control of situations. Youth\nA has on a number of instances taken her clothes off when she is\nupset. She then does various sexual behaviors (i.e., “twerking,”\nrubbing her hands on her vagina, asked to be “fucked”, runs through\nthe campus naked). There is a need to protect Youth A’s dignity and\nmodesty when she is upset as well as protect the other youth on\ncampus from being triggered. It is in the regard the following plan is to\n6",
    "be initiated and followed. Additionally, Youth A has been picking up\nrocks causing damage to property, breaking windows (leaving glass for\nothers to use to self-harm), and assault staff. This is a significant safety\nrisk, not just for Youth A but for the other youth and staff.\n When Youth A is beginning to get upset (noted by her telling\nstaff she is going to AWOLP, begins threating, or begins telling\nstaff she is refusing) staff are to remind her:\n Of her sticker program and the rewards she is wanting.\n Staff are to encourage Youth A to use:\n Time in the Sensory Room\n The Weighted Blanket\n Ask to go to the swings\n Ask for a “5”\n If Youth A refuses these things staff are to maintain eyes on\n If Youth A begins to pick up rocks, demonstrates she is\nbeginning to take her cloths off, or is within 20 feet of any\nbuilding or vehicle staff are to utilize the following immediately:\n Mirror and matching\n Use an escort\n Place in the Therapeutic restraint\n If the use of restraint is needed, staff are to remain in the hold\nwith Youth A until she is fully calm. This will prevent her from\nengaging in unsafe behaviors immediately after she is released\nfrom the restraint (as is her practice).\n Staff are to follow all Eagle Village’s policy and procedures in\nregard to restraints.\n Safety Plan for Youth A created on 11/19/2021 which is as follows:\no Purpose: Youth A is mirroring some of the other girls in the house in\nher talk and behaviors. She is ingesting perfume and on Tuesday\ndrank dry eraser board cleaner. She was taken to the ER and\nassessed by CMH. They believe this is not a psychiatric issue but a\nbehavioral one. Youth A continues to struggle with impulsive behaviors\ntherefore she will be on a safety plan with 5-minute checks.\no The following is the safety plan:\n All items will be removed from the youth’s room, except for a\npillow (pillowcase need to be removed) and comforter,\nimmediately upon being placed on Close Observation. (This is\nfor suicidal ideation only so youth cannot use bed sheets or\npillowcases as a means of suicide).\n Bedroom door is to remain open at all times.\n Youth Should remain in staff eyesight and close proximity to\nstaff (with the exception to private/sleeping times) will only use\ntheir bedrooms to sleep. They are not to hang out down the\nhallways on Close Obs.\n7",
    " The youth should be encouraged to participate in all program\nactivities. Youth should have a designated staff to observe them\nduring the program activities.\n Staff will accompany youth to the bathroom. Staff will “pocket\ncheck” the youth before entering the bathroom. They will check\nthe bathroom for any potential objects that could be used to\ninflict harm. When using the bathroom or shower, the staff will\ncheck on the youth every two minutes. Staff will initiate\nconversation or ask the youth a question through the door. If the\nyouth does not respond, staff will enter the bathroom to ensure\nthe youth is safe.\n At quiet time and bedtime, a staff will present in the hallway with\nthe focus on directly supervising that youth, until the youth falls\nasleep, with the door open.\n Once the youth is asleep, staff does not need to sit directly\noutside their door, however; staff must continue variable checks\nwithin 5 minutes from the last check, this will be documented on\nthe 5 Minute Log. Example: If staff were sitting outside the\nyouth’s door from 11pm-3am, they only need to write down\n“sitting outside door from 11pm-3am” in the 5 minute log. They\ndo not have to write that every 5 minutes. Once 5 minute checks\nresume, then staff document each 5 minute check on the log.\n If further issues/concerns arise with this youth, the on call\ntherapist will be contacted again.\n Behavior Support Plan for Youth A created on 11/24/2021which is as follows:\no Purpose: Youth A has demonstrated through her behaviors she is\nincapable of keeping herself safe. She claims she has ingested\nanything that she can find (i.e., beads, perfume, glass, cleaner). This\nhas been an ongoing pattern with incidents (of attempting to break into\nthe office to gain access to these things as well as ingesting items)\noccurring on (11/01/2021, 11/02/2021, 11/07/2021, 11/07/2021,\n11/13/2021, 11/15/2021, 11/15/2021, 11/15/2021, 11/15/2021,\n11/16/2021, 11/16/2021, 11/17/2021, 11/17/2021, 11/17/2021,\n11/18/2021, 11/18/2021, 11/19/2021, 11/20/2021, 11/20/2021,\n11/21/2021, 11/21/2021, 11/24/2021). It is believed these actions are\nnot a result of suicidal ideation but rather, behavioral in nature. As a\nresult of these instances the Sherk house quickly becomes\ndysregulated. There is a need to protect Youth A from continued\nhurting herself.\no The following plan will occur:\n Youth A will be stationed at the Sherk kitchen table.\n While at the table she will be allowed crayons, paper, and\ntherapeutic worksheets assigned by the therapist.\n A schedule will be provided and followed. The schedule will\nprovide Youth A with the following:\n8",

This will prevent her from\nengaging in unsafe behaviors immediately after she is released\nfrom the restraint (as is her practice).\n Staff are to follow all Eagle Village’s policy and procedures in\nregards to restraints.\no Addendum to this plan (no date) was as follows: Youth A met with the\nadministrative team this morning about her continued behaviors. She\nwas in numerous restraints throughout the weekend due to her\nunwillingness to comply with expectations. She continues to\ndemonstrate a lack of ability to manage her emotions, respect those\naround her and keep herself safe. She will remain on this program\nthough Friday 12/3/2021.\no Addendum to this plan dated 12/3/2021 was as follows: Youth A met\nwith the administrative team this morning. She has demonstrated she\nis capable of keeping herself safe. She still has some work to do in this\narea though. Due to her ability to go over 24 hours without the need of\nrestraint of self-harming, the following modifications are made:\n Youth A is still to remain at the table during free time\n If there is an activity going on she may ask the staff if she may\njoin. It is at the staff discretion if she does and is based on her\ncompliance.\n Youth A may have an extra 15 minutes in the morning and\nevening of outside time. This 15 minutes is to allow her to play\nand should be restricted to Sherk areas.\n If she is demonstrating safe behaviors, she may go on the van\nride to the Saturday night off campus activity.\n Continues safe behaviors will allow her to go to the church\ndinner on Sunday.\n9",
    " These privs can be revoked for unsafe behaviors.\no Addendum to this plan dated 12/7/2021 was as follows: Youth A met\nwith the administrative team. Youth A has demonstrated she is able to\nkeep herself and other safe. She had minor issues but was able to quickly\nreregulate. Due to this Youth A has earned the following modifications:\n Youth A will remain at the table with the above expectations\n Youth A will be allowed to wear her own clothes\n Youth A will be able to have her salt rock night light in her room\nwhen she goes to bed and is to return it in the morning.\n Aside from her personal clothing, these privs can be restricted if\nYouth A is not activity being safe.\n Behavior Support Plan for Youth B created on 11/24/2021which is as follows:\no Purpose: Youth B has demonstrated through her behaviors she is\nincapable of keeping herself safe. She claims she has ingested\nanything that she can find (i.e., beads, perfume, glass, cleaner). This\nhas been an ongoing pattern with incidents occurring on (11/01/2021,\n11/01/2021, 11/01/2021, 11/03/2021, 11/03/2021, 11/03/2021,\n11/4/2021, 11/13/2021, 11/15/2021, 11/15/2021, 11/20/2021,\n11/21/2021, 11/23/2021, and 11/24/2021). It is believed these actions\nare not a result of suicidal ideation but rather, behavioral in nature.\nYouth B is capable of processing, and knows the expectations and the\ndifference between right and wrong.

Youth A\nwent into the staff office without permission and began to go through\nthings in a desk. Staff attempted to escort Youth A out of the office\nhowever was unable to do so. Staff was alone in the house due to the\nother staff having been radioed to another house for support. Staff\nused “close proximity” and each time Youth A would drop to the ground\nand then attempt to kick staff while on the ground. The other staff\narrived back at the house and Youth A ran out of the house, both staff\nfollowed and went into a level one extended arm escort which\ntransition into the safety position.\no IR 127090183 dated 11/7/2021 – 2nd restraint in a series of 4.

    "Foster Care Worker was interviewed via telephone on January 19, 2022. Foster\nCare Worker said she has been working with Youth B for many years and is fully\ninvolved in all of her behavior support plans with Eagle Village. Foster Care Worker\nsaid Therapist contacts her frequently and none of the behavior support plans are\nimplemented without her approval. Foster Care Worker said there is a history of\nconcerns with Youth B’s telephone conversations with her grandmother and they\nhave had to restrict and limit them several times over the past few months. Foster\nCare Worker said Youth B’s grandmother will relay messages from Youth B’s father\nwho’s parental rights are terminated which is inappropriate. Foster Care Worker said\nYouth B’s grandmother also will “feed into” Youth B’s negativity which has led to\nYouth B having more concerning behaviors after her phone conversations with her\ngrandmother. Foster Care Worker said she had a phone conversation with Therapist\non 11/24/2021 which led to her deciding they should restrict Youth B’s telephone\ncalls with her grandmother until Youth B was able to “stabilize”. Foster Care Worker\nsaid once Youth B was able to show safe behaviors it was decided to limit the phone\ncalls to 10 minutes. Foster Care Worker said it was decided that 10 minutes would\nbe enough time for Youth B and grandmother to check in with one another but not\nlead into inappropriate topics or feed negative comments that Youth B would often\nmake. Foster Care Worker said she was also able to communicate expectations with\nYouth B’s grandmother during the few days that the calls were restricted so that\ngrandmother could fully understand what was allowed and not during the phone\nconversations. Foster Care Worker said the behavior support plan that Therapist\ncreated for Youth B has been the only thing that has worked for Youth B to become\nrestabilized when she is dysregulated for a period of time. Foster Care Worker said\nshe feels Eagle Village is doing a really good job with Youth B and doing all they can\nto provide her the best treatment and programming.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face via TEAMS on January 19, 2022.\nTherapist said she wrote the behavior support plan for Youth B and reviewed it in its\nentirety with Foster Care Worker on 11/24/2021 prior to implementation. Therapist\nsaid she and Foster Care Worker had been in communication about Youth B’s\ncontact with her grandmother for a period of time prior to the behavior support plan.\nTherapist said the calls were restricted by the Foster Care Worker previously and on\n11/24/2021 it was decided again to restrict calls for a short time due to Youth B’s\ndysregulated behaviors as well as the Foster Care Worker needing to communicate\nwith Youth B’s grandmother what is acceptable to talk to Youth B about. Therapist\nsaid previously Youth B’s grandmother had relayed messages to Youth B from her\nfather as well as fed into Youth B’s negative behaviors which caused many issues\nfor Youth B’s mental health and ultimately led to some self-harm behaviors.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Behavior Support Plan for Youth B created on 11/24/2021which is as follows:\no Addendum (date unknown):\n14",

This allows all staff to\nquickly identify youth who need extra support to remain safe and have an identified\nbehavior or safety plan. When her behavior plan was started, [Youth A] was taking\nher clothes off in public areas (school, parking lot). [Youth A] was wearing some of\nher own dresses and skirts which enabled her to quickly become naked in public\nareas, as well as “flashing” her male peers. The use of program clothes has allowed\n[Youth A] to focus on actions while being safe.”\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Behavior Support Plan for Youth A:\no Addendum to this plan dated 12/7/2021 was as follows: Youth A met\nwith the administrative team. Youth A has demonstrated she is able to\nkeep herself and other safe. She had minor issues but was able to quickly\nreregulate.

The facility removed Youth A\nand Youth B’s personal clothing and provided them program\nclothing for safety reasons due to self-harm and self-exposure\nconcerns.\nTechnical Assistance\nThe facility was reminded that having youth wear specific clothing to\nidentify the youth as a safety risk alone would be a violation of rules.\nHowever, to restrict specific clothing to prevent self-exposure is\nappropriate.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n16",
