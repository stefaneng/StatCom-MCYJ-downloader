    "Report and recommendations provided to management and other\nadministration on 10/24/2024.\nAgency Mandated Reporting Policy - (WCC Residential Policies\n& Procedures Section II, Part H). The policy indicates that as\nregulated childcare providers, Whaley staff are mandated\nreporters in accordance with Section 722 of the Child Protection\nLaw. In the event a child reports or you become aware of any\npossible abuse or neglect, you must report to DHHS- Children’s\nProtective Services Centralized Intake by calling 1-855-444-3911\nwithin 24 hours of receiving the information.\nChild Complaint Policy - (WCC Residential Policies &\nProcedures Section VII, Part F). The policy indicates that any\nstaff member who initially receives a complaint from a child can\neither call in to the child abuse hotline on their own or notify their\nResidential Manager before the end of the current shift. Per Public\nLaw, staff can call the complaint on their own but are encouraged\nto utilize Residential Management for support. Staff members that\nneed to file a complaint after hours should contact CRT. Once the\nreporting staff member files the complaint then he/she should get\nthe log number and enter that number on the DHHS-3200 Form.\nAnalysis At the conclusion of the investigation, the agency was found to be\nin non-compliance with licensing rule 4131. Interviews of staff and\nadministrators confirmed that the agency failed to make a report of\nsuspected abuse or neglect to the State of Michigan centralized\nintake line.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe agency’s reporting policy and child complaint policy need to\nbe updated so they are in line with the Child Protection Law. The\npolicy should indicate staff are to contact central intake\nimmediately rather than 24 hours and the staff who becomes\naware of the alleged abuse must report the abuse and not wait for\na manager to be notified.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n12",
