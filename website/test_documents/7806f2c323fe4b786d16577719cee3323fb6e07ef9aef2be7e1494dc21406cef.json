    "more clearly show that the worker was provided the copy of this\ninformation.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• None requested or required this inspection.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW:\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod:\n• The first incident related to an allegation that the foster parent punched one\nfoster child in the face and stomach and threw a toy at him. Additionally, that\nthe foster parent grabbed and slapped another foster child. During the\nspecial evaluation one child reported the foster parent had cursed and\nslapped him; the other foster child did not corroborate the allegations; but\nreported the foster parent was awesome. The foster parent denied slapping\nany of the children; but admitted to yelling, that she had used curse words\ntoward one child, and grabbed him by his shirt. Also, that and she had pulled\nanother child by is legs to place him gently on the floor. The foster parent\nwas found in noncompliance of the foster home’s behavior management\nrules. A corrective action plan was completed with the foster parent that\nincluded the foster parent completing 24 hours of Grow training as it relates to\ndevelopment, attachment, prudent parenting, diversity, mental health, and\nother connecting subjects.\nThe agency adhered all to departmental timeframes and requirements related\nto this special evaluation except R400.12327 (5)(c) and R400.1237(6)(a)\nwhere it received a citation.\n• The second incident related to an allegation that during an argument with the\nfoster child, one of the foster parents pulled the foster child’s hood and\npushed her into a closet. The special evaluation did not substantiate that\nallegation but concluded that the foster parent had yelled at the foster children\nand referred to them as heifers and liars. A corrective action plan was\ncompleted with the foster parents around training and learning appropriate\ndiscipline techniques to use with children. The agency adhered to\ndepartmental timeframes and requirements related to this special evaluation.\n11",
    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period. This corrective action plan related to the agency’s renewal\ninspection where the agency received 27 rule violations.\nDuring this current inspection for the agency’s interim review, the agency received\n21 rule violations. This was a decrease from the last inspection. Of these 21\ncitations, 18 are repeat violations within the last two years (16 are specific repeat\nviolations from the last inspection). The agency’s CAP compliance around these\n16 rule violations is as follows: 3 rule violations cited showed the number of\nindividual cases cited stayed the same( that being 1of 8 and 2 of 8); 4 other rule\nviolations cited showed a decrease in the number of individual cases cited (from 4\nof 8 to 1 of 8 related to 2 rules, 4 of 8 to 2 of 8 related to another rule, and 7 of 8\nto 5 of 8 related to the last rule); 9 other rule violations showed a slight increase in\nthe number of individual cases cited( from 2 of 19 to 3 of 13 related to one of these\nrules; 3 of 6 to 4 of 6 related to a second rule; 2 of 8 to 4 of 8 related to the third;\nand 1 of 8 to 3 of 8 related to a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and nineth rule).\nElectronic and or physical documents/tools were reviewed for verification of CAP\nimplementation and compliance. The above reporting showed that the agency,\ndespite the number of repeat violations, made some gains to reduce its overall\nnumber of rule violations cited; and had some success at reducing the number of\nindividual cases cited by its efforts to fully implement the corrective action plan.\nThe number of repeat citations also show that continued work and efforts to more\nfully operationalize its CAP must continue. The agency admitted an awareness of\nthis, and that it plans to continue its efforts.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 11/18/2024. The chief\nadministrator (CA) reported the agency continues to implement several strategies\nin its efforts to ensure compliance with rules, policies and Act 116. These\nstrategies included developing spreadsheets to track due dates, along with outlook\ncalendar reminders. The agency also reported, utilizing Health Liaison Officers\n(HLO) to assist foster care staff in obtaining medical and dental care for foster\nchildren. The CA also reportedly that medical passports are being provided at the\ntime of placement and replacement; and staff are using their Book of Business,\nweekly KPI (Key Performance Indicator) meetings; and that training and monthly\nsupervisions has aided with ensuring for proper care and placement of children,\nand the timely completion of reports and social work contacts. The CA also\nreported the agency has gone paperless, staff have become proficient at\nuploading documents into the electronic file; and staffing groups meet monthly\nwith their laptops to discuss barriers, solutions, and entering missing social work\ncontacts.\n12",
    "Barriers that have impacted rule compliance were reported by the CA as the\nagency continuing to experience staffing changes, and turnover, some due to\nworkers' and supervisors' medical leaves.\nThe CA indicated the agency has implemented the bulk of its corrective plan, and\nit plans to continue utilizing all its tools and protocols to increase compliance\nareas.\nFinancial Overview\nThis is not applicable. This is a Department of Health and Human Services\nDistrict office.\nStaff interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the chief administrator, and a number of her\nmanagement staff at the entrance conference, I interviewed two foster care\nworkers, a licensing worker, licensing supervisor, and foster care supervisor. The\nemployees interviewed reported the following as strengths of the agency: the\nagency is always working to improve its compliance numbers; the agency focuses\non what needs to be done better, various supervisors and managers are good at\nlistening to you; and the agency tries to do things with staff appreciation. Areas\nwhere the employees felt growth is needed, included providing more professional\ndevelopment training or skill building to staff so as to aid the employee in\nachieving professional advancement; supervisors being more helpful with new\nworker, and or to have a mentor program for new workers similar to what the\nchildren’s protective services program has; and having the HLOs to handle foster\nchildren medical care needs, so as to enable foster care workers to focus on\nquality time with children and families.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through the of the agency's office did not reveal any concerns or safety\nissues. The agency continues to have lots of office space and equipment. The\nagency has gone paperless and has electronic files.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts reported during this licensing period.\n13",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nJanuary 29, 2025\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 6, 2025\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n14"
