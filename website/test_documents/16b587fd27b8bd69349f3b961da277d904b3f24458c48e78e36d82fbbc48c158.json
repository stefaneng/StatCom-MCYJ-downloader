In addition to\nplacement preference, when a child is removed from their\nhome, federal and state laws allow for relatives to participate\nin the case and have contact with the child.

Ongoing efforts to identify,\nlocate, and engage relatives is an expected part of case\nplanning and permanency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency is not prioritizing or allowing family visits or family placement for\nyouth in foster care.\nInvestigation Reporting Source was interviewed by telephone on 09/29/2022.\nOther than what was reported in the intake allegation, the reporting\nsource added that a child should be placed with relatives opposed to\nstrangers. Reporting Source stated attempts were made to the agency\nseveral times in an attempt to speak with the foster care worker (FCW)\nabout family visits but there were no contacts made. It was stated that\nmessages were left but no telephone calls were returned. It was stated\nthat the agency is not helping with reunification between the family and\nYouth A.\nAdministrator was interviewed by telephone on 09/29/2022 due to\nillness. The administrator stated she believes that DHHS is\ninvestigating at least one family member for abuse and neglect, and\nthat the relatives of Youth A have not been ignored by the assigned\nfoster care worker. She said the best person to discuss Youth A’s case\nwith is his assigned foster care worker.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed by telephone on\n09/29/2022. She stated she was not in the office and was going on\nvacation and would not be returning until 10/10/2022. The FCW stated\nshe received Youth A’s case on 03/29/2019, and that his parental rights\nwere terminated in December of 2021. She stated currently, Youth A is\nacting out sexually with his peers in school and the agency is\nattempting to get him stabilized by way of therapy so he can maintain\nhis current placement. She said she has spoken with Youth A’s great\ngrand mother regarding visits in the near future.\n4",
    "Foster Care Worker was interviewed face-to-face on 10/31/2022.\nFCW stated that Youth A is eight years old and has significant mental\nhealth needs and is in once-weekly therapy and is diagnosed with\nPTSD, anxiety, depression, impulse control disorder, and suspected\nchild sexual abuse. He also has an IEP in place and had a tutor last\nsummer. She said the agency is currently in the process of getting an\nSED Waiver in place for Youth A to get additional supports in place for\nhim as his behavioral concerns have resulted in the foster parents\nbeing hesitant regarding placement. She said there are so many\nintricate details to Youth A’s case and the agency is trying to take many\nthings into consideration, but mostly Youth A's best interest. FCW said\nas soon as Youth A is more stable visits with his great grandmother will\nbegin at the agency office. She said she has been in contact with his\ngreat grandmother, and she is in support of this plan of getting him\nstable as not to regress with his behaviors.\nFCW stated in March 2022, there were multiple (approximately five)\nDHHS complaints received within a span of a week, all of which alleged\nthat the uncle was living in the home and was sexually abusing Youth\nA, that he is a prostitute who is bringing \"tricks\" into the home and\nhaving sex with them, and that the grandmother and grandfather (who\nthe agency were told was not living in the home) were abusing drugs\nsuch as Percocet. She said it was also found out that within a span of\n2-3 months, there were 17 police calls made to the maternal\ngrandmother's home where Youth A was residing. FCW said Youth A\nmissed a significant number of days from school as well. On 3/11/22,\nFostering Futures, DHHS, and MCI determined that it was in Youth A’s\nbest interest to remove him from the home on an emergent basis due to\nthe severity of the allegations. FCW stated that there were substantial\nfindings noted in the DHHS investigation related to these relatives.\nFCW stated Youth A was placed in an unrelated foster home in March\n2022, and since then, two of the grandmother’s other sons came\nforward expressing interest in placement of Youth A; one lives in Texas,\nand one who currently lives in Arizona. FCW said she has been in\ncommunication with both of them. She said she explained to them that\nmoving a foster child across state lines is never an easy process and\nthat among other things, the agency will have to determine what is in\nYouth A's best interest prior to a decision being made. She said when\nYouth A was asked about the uncle in Texas, he stated \"if they're telling\nyou I have an uncle in Texas and identified his name, his family is\nlying.\" FCW said she had a phone call scheduled with this uncle on\n10/12/2022 to complete a preliminary family assessment. FCW said\nhistorically the uncle in Texas frequently traveled back and forth from\nthe grandmother’s home and has a room at her house, so if Youth A\n4",
    "was placed with this uncle, the agency would be concerned that Youth\nA would continue to see his grandmother and uncle. She said she had\na phone call with the uncle in Arizona on 10/13/2022 to complete a\npreliminary family assessment for him. FCW said she attempted to call\nthe uncle several times but was unable to contact him. Her final\nattempt was 12/02/2022 and to date he has not returned any of her\nphone calls.\nFCW said she has been in communication with the maternal great-\ngrandmother, and she has expressed interest in visits with Youth A.\nFCW said she discussed this information with Youth A's LGAL during\nan FTM and the decision was made that the agency would be willing to\ndo an in-person visit with the great grandmother in the near future and\nthis was expressed to the great- grandmother. FCW said she has had\ncommunication with maternal great-aunt, who seems to be more of a\nfamily 'spokesperson' as she tends to leave voicemails where she is\nworked up and complaining that Youth A is not placed with family\nmembers. She said she has returned all of the voicemails left on her\nphone. It is noted that the FCW has documentation to support this\ninformation.\nReview of MiSACWIS documentation on 10/07/2022, Updated\nService Plan dated 08/28/2022 – 11/25/2022. It was documented that\nupon Youth A entering foster care in September 2018, he was placed\nwith his maternal grandmother. In March 2022, there were several\ncomplaint calls to DHHS which alleged sexual abuse, physical abuse,\nimproper supervision, and substance abuse in the home. A safety plan\nwas put into place with the grandmother, however she was found to be\nin violation of the safety plan which outlined that she is not allowed to\nhave her son (who is listed as a perpetrator) living in the home and that\nshe is not to allow any unsupervised contact between her son and\nYouth A. Additional DHHS complaints were received following the\nabove allegations, so, Youth A was removed from the maternal\ngrandmother's care on 3/11/22 on an emergent basis and the\nplacement was found to no longer be in Youth A's best interest. Youth\nA was placed in a licensed unrelated foster home on 3/11/22. On\n9/15/22, the foster parents signed an Intent to Adopt, indicating that\nthey are not interested in adopting Youth A. He is currently in the\nprocess of being photo-listed on MARE. In addition, there have been\ntwo out-of-state maternal uncles who have expressed interest in\nplacement of Youth A, and they are currently being assessed by the\nagency.\nOther documentation reviewed regarding Youth A’s case include\nthe following:\n4",
    "• Updated Service Plan dated 5/30/2022 – 8/27/2022 detailing\nYouth A’s safety plan.\n• DHHS report dated 05/06/2022 substantiating the maternal\ngrandmother and son regarding the allegations made.\n• Suspension from school letter dated 06/06/2022 due to\ninappropriate behaviors including making derogatory statements\ntowards female students of what he wants to touch and taste\nregarding their body parts.\n• Recommendation to deny consent for adoption for the maternal\ngrandmother dated 10/26/2022.\nAnalysis No violation is found. There was insufficient information to determine\nthat the agency was not communicating with Youth A’s family or trying\nto keep Youth A from seeing and visiting his relatives. Documentation\nreviewed and interviews show the agency has been involved with the\nfamily, although assessed some family members as not in Youth A’s\nbest interest to have contact with at this time. Additional documentation\nshows two uncles have and are being assessed as potential placement\noptions.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy.\nWe recommend that the current license status be continued.\n01/25/2023\n_____________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/01/2023\n____________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4",
