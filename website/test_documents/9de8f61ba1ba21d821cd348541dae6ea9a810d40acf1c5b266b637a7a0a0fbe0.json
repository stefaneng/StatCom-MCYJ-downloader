In order to address these violations, the facility developed and used a new\nhire checklist, and the team leader is ensuring the location and who the youth was\ndischarged to is located in the youth's file.\nFinancial Overview",
    "There were no concerns based on review of the facility’s financial audit and\nbudget.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported things are going well at the facility, but they are\nready for construction to be finished, so they can resume normal functioning. CA\nreported developing the new hire checklist for new employee files has helped\nsignificantly with ensuring their employee files meet licensing requirements.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported there's good communication regarding training, policy changes,\nprocedure changes, etc. as the facility posts them online as well as updates the\nboard. Staff reported youth specialists support each other very well and\nsupervisors support all the staff as well. Staff reported it's a great environment and\na great place to work. Staff reported the only things they would like to see improve\nare:\n- Having more meetings with the whole team, so everyone is on the same\npage rather than just having those meetings during shift changes.\n- Construction to be finished because it's been difficult not having the use\nof the entire building and not being able to go outside due to the safety\nconcerns.\n- Some double standards for staff exist likely due to relationships or\nseniority, which causes some morale problems.\nYouth reported they are well fed, but the food quality could be improved. Youth\nreported staff are good and staff treat them well. Youth reported they feel safe at\nthe facility and have staff to talk to if they feel unsafe. Youth reported the only\ncomplaint is not being able to go outside due to the safety issues surrounding the\nbuilding construction.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility was completed on October 11, 2024. There were no\nconcerns for the parts of the facility currently in use. Some parts of the facility were\nnot able to be viewed due to the ongoing construction occurring. However, a\nwalkthrough of Phase 1 construction was completed. Although it is not ready for\noccupancy yet, progress has continued to be made, and it is hopeful they'll be able\nto begin using the new phase within the next couple months.",
