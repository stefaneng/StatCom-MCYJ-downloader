Supervisor 1 submitted a policy statement on\n01/14/2020 related to nebulizers and other medications for residents while at school.\nThe policy was developed after the incident under investigation. The policy stated,\n“Youth who utilize inhalers for emergency situations will have access to these items\nduring the school day. The staff will be responsible for maintaining and assisting with\nadministration of medical needs.”\nYouth A (DOB: 02/03/04) was interviewed at the facility on 02/10/2020.

Youth C stated she did not have access to a nebulizer until they were able\nto contact the staff member who had the nebulizer.
