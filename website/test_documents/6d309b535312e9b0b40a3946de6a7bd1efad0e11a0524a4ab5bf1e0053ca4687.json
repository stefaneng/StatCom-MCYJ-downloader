INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection\nDescription (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iii)Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or otherwise\nsuggesting physical or emotional harm to a youth.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 told Youth S that if Youth S hits her, she would hit her\nback.\nInvestigation I interviewed Team Leader, who is also the Complainant, with the\nRights Officer present. On 02/07/23 at 2:30pm, she said she\nwalked onto A wing and witnessed Staff 1 and Youth S arguing\nback and forth. “Staff 1 told Youth S she would beat her ass and\nsaid, ‘I don’t give a fuck about this job.’” An unidentified staff was\nphysically holding or pulling Staff 1 back from Youth S. Another\nstaff was holding or pulling Youth S back from Staff 1. “I locked\nmy elbow with Staff 1 and walked her (off of the wing) to the\nconference room. It took Staff 1 awhile to calm down.”\nOn 2/8/23, Rights Officer notified me Vista Maria had placed Staff\n1 on administrative leave. Rights Officer attempted to reach her\nto facilitate a face-to-face interview, but she did not respond. Staff\n1’s employment was terminated on 2/10/23. Prior to being\nterminated, Rights Officer indicated she wrote a statement\ndescribing the incident.\n2",
    "I interviewed Youth S with the Rights Officer present. According\nto Youth S, Staff 1 picked up the Target Book and “went off” on\nher. “She said she don’t give a fuck about this job and stop\nfucking talking to her. I don’t know what I did. She (Staff 1) stood\nup and threw her purse on the table. I took it as a physical threat.\nShe asked, ‘You wanna fight?’ Staff 2 and 3 got in front of her\nand held her back while talking to her. They made her go off the\nwing.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 with the Rights Officer present. She said\nYouth S confronted Staff 1 for “writing her up.” “Staff 1 said ‘I\ndon’t give a fuck’ and told Youth S that she was disrespectful.\nYouth S cussed at Staff 1. Staff 1 was raising her voice. Staff 1\nput her glasses down so they wouldn’t get broken. I tried to\nintervene as well as Staff 3…My interventions were directed\ntoward Youth S. Staff 3 asked Staff 1 to calm down and walk to\nthe conference room.” I asked if Staff 1 threatened to hit Youth S.\nShe said Staff 1 threatened, “If you put your hands on me, I’ll put\nmy hands on you.” I asked if Staff 1 threw her purse on a table.\nStaff 2 said Staff 1 did not have a purse.\nStaff 1 did not avail herself for a face-to-face interview prior to\nbeing terminated. The following are excerpts from her written\naccount of the incident on 2/7/23:\nI, Staff 1, got into a verbal confrontation on A wing…with\nYouth S. Youth S became upset with me at school for\nredirecting her more than once…I had a sheet that I wrote\nnegatives on pertaining to Youth S’ behavior and other\nstudents. When it was time to go back to the building from\nthe school, Youth S refused to ‘buddy’ (link arms with staff or\nanother youth) …She started using profanity… I didn’t want\nit to escalate so I left it alone and let the school staff handle\nit.\nWhen we returned to the building, I…was told to do an\nincident report. I took the computer to A wing because I had\nto get the Target Book to write my negatives. Youth S…tried\ntalking to me asking who I was doing an incident report on…\nI was not at liberty to discuss that…and wasn’t going to even\nif I was. Youth S began trying to talk… and argue with me\nabout how I be doing too much and how I get on her nerves.\nI explained to her that if I’m doing too much, I know I must\nbe doing my job. I did not give in to the profanity that was\nbeing used toward me… until I felt threatened by Youth S.\n3",
    "Youth S began to walk toward me using profanity and saying\nhow she would put her hands on me. I told Youth S that she\ndoesn’t scare me and if she does put her hands on me, I\nwould put my hands back on her and hand in my badge.\nYouth S kept trying to argue and finally I had to be the bigger\nperson and go into the conference room with my coworker to\ncool off…I know I was wrong when I said I would put my\nhands back on her but that was my way of protecting myself\nbecause Youth S has been known to put her hands on not\nonly peers but staff as well. If I ever felt it had to come to\nthat, I would definitely talk with my supervisor, but I said\nwhat I thought would keep Youth S from actually physically\nattacking me.\nAnalysis Former Staff 1 lost control and responded with a verbal threat\nwhen she felt physically threatened by Youth S. Vista Maria\nplaced the staff on administrative leave on 2/7/23 and terminated\nher on 2/20/23.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nFebruary 23, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 8, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n4"
