On\n06/09/2025, it was disclosed that Youth A consumed laundry\ndetergent. Youth A was not being supervised, and she was\nsupposed to be supervised when she did laundry. Youth A has\ndrunk detergent in the past. Youth A reported she was throwing up\nand she tried to tell staff, but they reported she was lying. Youth A\nwas sent to nursing and reported her stomach was hurting. Youth\nA was provided with medication and sent back to class. Alleged\nPerpetrator: Unknown.\nInvestigation Administrator 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility\nwith the MDHHS Worker on 7/10/2025. He reported Youth A can\ndo Youth A’s laundry and it is a life skill that is taught to the youth\nin the program. Youth A is allowed to do laundry but under\nsupervision since the laundry room is locked. He reported Youth A\nhas been on a 1:1 supervision level from 3/24/25 to 6/22/25. This\n1:1 supervision level began because of Youth A becoming\ndysregulated and engaging in swallowing items such as screws\nand paperclips. As Youth A became more emotionally regulated\nand stable, the 1:1 supervision was lifted. Administrator1 reported\nthe 1:1 is not for a 24-hour time frame per day but when Youth A\nis dysregulated, which generally occurs in the afternoon after\nschool and the daily structure is not as structured as during the\nschool time. Administrator 1 reported if Youth A displays\n2",
    "dysregulation, the facility can place Youth A back on 1:1 when\nnecessary. Regarding the laundry for Youth A, Administrator 1\nreported the laundry soap is kept in the chemical closet, which is\nlocked, and staff are responsible for providing the laundry soap for\nyouth. In the case of Youth A and because of her history most of\nthe time, Youth A is not allowed to have liquid items because\nYouth A will claim to swallow the liquid. Therefore, staff will place\nthe laundry soap into the washing machine for Youth A.\nAdministrator 1 reported when Youth A is doing well, in an effort to\nhelp develop Youth A’s independent living skills, Youth A is\nallowed to put laundry soap in the washing machine but with direct\nsupervision. Administrator 1 was interviewed again via phone\nwith MDHHS Worker on 7/11/2025. He reported the information\nof Youth A swallowing a screw will be passed on to staff and\nYouth A will be placed on a safety plan again with suicide\nprecautions. He reported this action will be documented and this\ndocumentation involves 15-minute (variable and interval)\nobservations logged. He reported Youth A swallowing a screw will\nbe documented and reported with follow up with Therapist within\n30-minutes to complete an evaluation. He reported the 1:1\nsupervision will be back in place for Youth A with a focus on\nhelping Youth A become successful. Administrator 1 was\ninterviewed for the third time face-to-face at the facility with\nthe MDHHS Worker on 7/29/2025. This interview was a result of\nthe latest allegations made by Youth A. Administrator 1 reported\nbeing aware of Youth A breaking lights on the milieu over the\nweekend and Youth A broke a soap dispenser while attempting to\ndrink soap. He reported Youth A is on “precautions” which\ninvolves Youth A not going to school because there is less\nsupervision available in the classroom. He reported the bathrooms\nare locked and Youth A’s activities and movements are limited\nbecause of the self-harming threat Youth A presents. He reported\nYouth A’s history is wanting to be moved from this placement and\nreturned home although, going home is not an option. Youth A\nhas made allegations against Youth A’s father in the past and\nYouth A’s parents are not able to provide the level of care Youth A\nrequires. Administrator 1 reported Youth A feels isolated from\nhaving no contact with Youth A’s family and will seek negative\nattention by threatening to harm others on the unit (staff and\nyouth). He reported the unit is still using the safety plan that was\ndeveloped at the beginning of the investigation with Youth A. He\nreported there is no toilet bowl cleaner on the unit and Youth A\nchanged the story when telling Nurse 1 later in the day.\nAdministrator 1 was interviewed for the fourth time face-to-\nface at the facility with the MDHHS Worker on 8/6/2025. He\nwas able to provide the video of the day in the latest allegations by\n3",
    "Youth A, for review (reviewed below). He reported the process for\nyouth cleaning is that staff will spray a cleaner on the surface of\nthe item to be cleaned and the youth will wipe the surface. Youth\nare not to have possession of any cleaning chemical, especially\nYouth A with Youth A’s history of allegedly drinking substances.\nHe reported again, all cleaning supplies are kept in a locked closet\nand youth are not allowed in the closet. He reported not knowing\nthe specific cleaning item placed in the water in the blue bucket\nbut is sure no toilet cleaner (has bleach) is used in the program.\nHe reported this information (issues with youth) is discussed in\nteam email and team meetings and the program has been\nmodified because of Youth A’s behaviors. The program is losing\nthe ability to provide independent living skills because it requires\nyouth to have responsibility for things that Youth A is unable to do,\nso restrictions (youth can’t pour laundry soap in machine, no liquid\nsoap in bathrooms) have become the norm.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with\nthe MDHHS Worker on 7/10/2025. She reported each youth has\na scheduled day for laundry. She reported the laundry soap is\nkept in the chemical closet with the rest of the cleaning chemicals\nand no youth are allowed inside this closet. She reported the\nlaundry soap is kept in a large tub and dispensed into a small\nmeasuring cup when needed. The measuring cup is then carried\nto the locked laundry room and poured into the washing machine\nby staff or youth (Staff supervise if youth pour). She reported\nyouth are not allowed to pour the soap into the washing machine if\nthere are restrictions on the youth. She described the restrictions\n(safety plan) on Youth A as Youth A is not to handle any liquid\nitems because of a history of allegations of swallowing the liquid.\nThis includes liquid hygiene items and cleaning items for the\nkitchen. Supervisor 1 reported there is no more than a minimal\namount of liquid laundry soap in the measuring cup at a time. She\nreported Youth A is not on a 1:1 in the laundry room but staff are\nto be present when the youth (if allowed as part of independent\nliving training) pours in the liquid soap. Supervisor 1 was asked\nabout yelling at Youth A and she denied yelling but only asking\nYouth A to get up.\nYouth A was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS Worker\non 7/11/2025. Youth A reported Fridays are Youth A’s laundry\nday, but Youth A soils the bed sheets 2-3 days a week and will do\nbedding laundry 2-3 days a week. Youth A described the laundry\nprocess as youth are allowed in the laundry room but not in the\nchemical room where the laundry soap is kept. Staff also pour the\nlaundry soap into the washing machine after unlocking the laundry\n4",
    "room door. Youth A reported sometimes the laundry room door is\nunlocked because it doesn’t get shut all the time. Youth A was\nunable to provide a specific day or time of the door being\nunlocked. Regarding the chemical room, Youth A reported the\nlaundry soap is kept in a large container and staff bring the soap\nto the laundry room in a plastic cup. Youth A reported putting the\nsoap in the washing machine a “couple of times” (then stated\ntwice a week) but most of the time, staff pour it in for Youth A.\nYouth A reported staff stay in the laundry room but at times staff\nwill leave to handle another youth leaving the youth in the laundry\nroom but when Youth A did laundry today, staff stood there and\nwatched Youth A. Youth A was asked about the drinking of\nlaundry soap in the allegation and Youth A reported it happened\nThursday, June 10, 2025. Youth A described the incident as telling\nSupervisor 2 that Youth A needed to do laundry because Youth\nA’s sheets were soiled. Youth A reported Supervisor 2 gave Youth\nA the plastic cup (described about 8-10 inches high full to the top\nwith liquid laundry soap) and after entering the laundry room, the\ndoor shut behind Youth A. Youth A reported feeling suicidal this\nday, so Youth A ingested more than half of the liquid laundry soap\nand gave the cup back to unknown staff while telling this unknown\nstaff (later identified as Supervisor 1) that Youth A had drank the\nliquid. Youth A reported the plastic cup is always full to the top\nwhen staff give Youth A the cup and during this incident the\nunknown staff just replied with “can’t do anything about it now”.\nYouth A then remembered it was Supervisor 1 who was the staff\nat the time. Youth A reported feeling nauseous and throwing up a\ncouple of times during the day. Youth A reported throwing up in\nthe bathroom at school and having a staff (unknown which staff)\ntell Staff 1 about the situation. Youth A reported Staff 1 told Youth\nA that Youth A needed to go to see the nurse. Youth A reported\nthe nurse (unable to recall who the nurse was) gave Youth A a red\npill that helped settle Youth A’s stomach. Youth A reported not\ntelling anyone else about this incident. Youth A was asked about a\nsafety plan and Youth A reported Youth A’s safety plan involves\nstaff having to stand and watch Youth A do things. Staff have to\nsupervise Youth A because of Youth A’s history of doing things\nand staff should be watching Youth A all the time. Youth A\nreported drinking “liquid laundry soap once every 2-3 weeks\ndepending on how Youth A feels”. Youth A reported the last time\nYouth A drank laundry soap was on Wednesday, July 9, 2025,\nafter speaking with Youth A’s family and becoming “mad”. Youth A\nreported this occurred at approximately 6:00 pm after telling\nSupervisor 3 that Youth A needed to do laundry. Youth A\ndescribed the incident as Supervisor 3 going to the chemical\ncloset and getting the laundry soap and handing Youth A the\n5",
    "plastic cup which was smaller maybe 6-8 inches high. Youth A\nreported Supervisor 3 left, and Youth A went into the laundry room\nalone. Youth A reported drinking all of the laundry soap but didn’t\ntell Supervisor 3 or any other staff after handing the empty cup to\nSupervisor 3. Youth A reported Youth A’s stomach was hurting\nbad, but Youth A didn’t throw up. Youth A was asked about feeling\nsafe and Youth A reported not feeling safe because Youth A is\nable to hurt Youth A more often and “this place makes {Youth A}\nwant to hurt {Youth A} more”. Youth A reported swallowing a\nscrew Youth A found in Youth A’s bedroom today but didn’t tell\nanyone of this action by Youth A. Youth A reported Supervisor 1\nwill yell at Youth A causing Youth A to “feel like harming myself\nnow”. Youth A reported this incident took place when Supervisor 1\nwas trying to get Youth A up in the morning and Youth A didn’t\nhear Supervisor 1 so Supervisor 1 yelled. Youth A was\ninterviewed again face-to-face at the facility with the MDHHS\nWorker on 7/29/2025. Youth A reported not understanding why\nYouth A was being interviewed but the new allegations resulted in\nthis interview. Youth A was asked about what has occurred since\nYouth A’s last interview and Youth A never mentioned the latest\nallegations of Youth A allegedly drinking toilet bowl cleaner or\nother chemicals. Youth A did report throwing up last Thursday\n(7/24/25) because Youth A had the stomach flu that lasted until\nthe end of this past weekend. Youth A reported last Thursday\n(7/24/25) Youth A was throwing up in the school bathroom before\ntelling Staff 2 that Youth A’s stomach hurt bad and Youth A had\nthrown up in the bathroom. Staff 2 then contacted nursing and\ntook Youth A back to the unit for a “sick bed” (youth stay in their\nrooms until feeling better). Youth A reported throwing up in the\nhallway bathroom three times around 9:00 pm and telling staff\n(unable to identify who) who looked at the vomit. Youth A reported\nbeing off “sick bed” on Saturday. Youth A then reported additional\nallegations of becoming mad at staff and breaking a soap\ndispenser in the hallway bathroom and drinking the liquid soap.\nYouth A reported being mad at Supervisor 2 because Youth A\nbelieved Supervisor 2 twisted Youth A’s words and was being\nrude to Youth A. Youth A reported Supervisor 2 didn’t want to talk\nabout Youth A’s problems when Youth A was explaining to\nSupervisor 2. Youth A reported Supervisor 2 told Youth A that if\nYouth A keeps breaking things on the unit (Youth A reported\nbreaking three lights) the other youth may jump Youth A. Youth A\nreported Supervisor 2 came into the bathroom and watched Youth\nA drink the soap. Home Supervisor called nursing because Youth\nA had blood in the vomit. Youth A reported throwing up on\nMonday (7/28/25) and Home Supervisor didn’t say anything but\ncalled nursing, who never came to see Youth A. Youth A denied\n6",
    "drinking any other liquids since the soap and didn’t know why\nYouth A threw up. Youth A reported the last thing Youth A\ningested was a week before the soap when Youth A found nails in\nthe soap dispenser. Youth A described the process of cleaning\nthe bathroom which is a chore Youth A has selected. Youth A\nreported all cleaning supplies are kept in the janitor closet\n(chemical closet) which is locked but according to Youth A the\ndoor doesn’t close all the way. Youth A gets a blue bucket that\nhas a toilet scrubber in it and staff add toilet bowl cleaner. Youth A\nwill dip the scrubber in the liquid and scrub the toilet. Youth A\nreported staff are in the milieu and don’t watch Youth A clean the\nbathroom. Youth A reported staff will spray the sink, toilet, and\nwalls so Youth A can wipe them clean with a cloth. Youth A\nreported Supervisor 2 doesn’t watch Youth A clean the bathroom.\nYouth A reported throwing up in school the morning of this\ninterview and not telling any of the staff. Youth A reported a belief\nthat Youth A’s stomach hurts bad right now because it is burning\nand may be a result of the soap Youth A drank a few days ago.\nYouth A was asked about reasons for not telling and reported\nbeing scared staff would yell at Youth A. Youth A reported not\nfeeling safe at the facility because the other youth want to fight\nYouth A and staff would allow it to happen. Youth A was asked\nabout the third allegations and reported a belief that the substance\nYouth A drank smelled like toilet bowl cleaner. Youth A denied\never telling anyone Youth A drank urine cleaner (reported to\nNurse 1). Youth A was asked about the situation and reported\nSupervisor 2 was supervising Youth A when Supervisor 2 left the\nbathroom to help other youth and Youth A drank toilet bowl\ncleaner. Youth A reported staff (unidentified by Youth A) will let\nYouth A have liquid cleaner to use in the bathroom but usually\nwatch Youth A clean the bathroom. Youth A reported over the\nweekend, she was breaking the overhead lights in the milieu,\ntaking a piece of broken plastic and threatening to harm other\nyouth and staff in the milieu but staff intervened, and no one was\nhurt.\nYouth B was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS Worker\non 7/11/2025. Youth B reported having Monday as Youth B’s\nlaundry day but being allowed to have additional time to do\nlaundry if needed.

Youth B reported youth are allowed in the\nlaundry room under the supervision of staff and the amount of\nsoap given to the youth to put into the machine is about 1 inch in\nthe plastic cup. Youth B denied the plastic cup is ever filled to the\n7",
    "top. When asked about any restrictions on youth in the laundry\nroom, Youth B reported Youth A is on precautions because Youth\nA will drink liquid soap, therefore staff have to handle the soap or\nother liquid items for Youth A. Youth B reported if staff allow Youth\nA to put laundry soap into the washing machine, staff will watch\nYouth A pour it in the washing machine and Youth B has never\nobserved Youth A in the laundry room without staff being present.\nYouth A reported staff are always watching Youth A, even when\nYouth A goes outside, staff are by Youth A. Youth B reported\nfeeling safe at the facility.\nTherapist was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS Worker\non 7/11/2025. She reported just meeting with Youth A and using\nDialectical Behavioral Treatment (DBT) techniques to help Youth\nA develop the mindfulness skills to handle unhealthy emotions in a\npositive manner. She reported being told by Youth A that Youth A\nswallowed a screw, but Youth A didn’t report where Youth A found\nthe screw. Therapist reported going to Nurse 1 with Youth A and\ninforming Nurse 1 about Youth A swallowing a screw. Youth A had\ntold Therapist the “screw was bigger than a normal screw”.\nTherapist reported Youth A saying Youth A swallowed a screw is\na normal occurrence for Youth A as is swallowing a liquid\nsubstance. Therapist reported never observing Youth A swallow\nany of the claimed items and all reported medical examination (x-\nrays) have not provided any evidence of Youth A swallowing a\nmetal object (screw). Therapist reported Youth A has a history of\nbeing dishonest in an effort to seek medical treatment or extra\nsupport from others. Therapist reported Youth A has never\nreported a staff yelled at Youth A.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS\nWorker on 7/21/2025. She reported the process for laundry\nservices for youth in the program involves the following steps.\nYouth will bring out their laundry and staff will unlock the laundry\nroom door, allowing the youth to place their clothing in the\nwashing machine. The youth will ask for laundry soap which the\nstaff will obtain from the locked chemical room, where the laundry\nsoap is kept in a large bucket. Staff will ask the youth to step out\nof the laundry room while getting the laundry soap. If another staff\nis available, the other staff will watch the youth in the laundry room\nwhile the primary staff obtains the laundry soap. Supervisor 2\nreported never leaving a youth alone in the laundry room and she\nnever allows youth to pour laundry soap into the washing\nmachine. She reported never observing another staff allowing\nyouth to be alone in the laundry room or pour laundry soap into\nthe washing machine. She reported working Thursday (2nd shift)\n8",
    "and Saturday and Sunday each week. Her shifts rotate between\n1st shift and 2nd shift every other weekend. Supervisor 2 was\nasked about Youth A and the laundry process and reported never\nallowing Youth A to be alone in the laundry room or handle the\nlaundry soap because of Youth A’s history of drinking liquids. She\nreported not allowing Youth A to touch the laundry soap on\nThursday 7/10/25 nor leaving Youth A alone in the laundry room.\nShe reported following the safety plan for Youth A and believes\nadministration is reenforcing the need to follow the policy during\nthe newest communication. Supervisor 2 was asked about 1:1\nsupervision and reported this means that staff are to not leave the\nyouth alone and keep eyes and ears on the youth at all times.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed again face-to-face at the facility\nwith the MDHHS Worker on 8/6/2025. Supervisor 2 reported\nhaving no knowledge of the allegations and after being told of the\nallegations, she denied the allegations ever took place. She\nreported Youth A has never shown Supervisor 2 any vomit from\nYouth A. She reported hearing from other staff (did not identify\nspecific staff) that Youth A has thrown up in the past. She denied\nYouth A has ever told Supervisor 2 that Youth A has ingested\nchemicals. She reported a belief of having a good relationship with\nYouth A and trying to help Youth A heal. She reported if being\ntold that Youth A had ingested something harmful, she would\nmake sure Youth A is alright and “contact nursing” to find out what\nthey would want Supervisor 2 to do with the situation. She\nreported she would follow nursing instructions. She reported\nYouth A is not to touch any chemicals and staff spray the cleaning\nsolution on the surface to be cleaned and the youth will wipe the\nsurface clean. She reported Youth A is never to touch a chemical\nand the spray bottle is never to be given to Youth A nor sat down\nwhen Youth A is around. In regard to the blue bucket, Supervisor\n2 reported not worrying about Youth A trying to grab the blue\nbucket because Youth A tries complete the bathroom chore in\n“about 2 seconds”. Supervisor 2 reported being notified of safety\nplans through staff email and staff meetings. She reported all staff\nare aware of the situation with Youth A and provide and adjust\nsupervision (increase if Youth A is displaying emotional\ndysregulation) to the situation that Youth A presents.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS\nWorker on 7/21/2025. She gave the same report as other staff\ninterviewed about the laundry process with a couple of exceptions.\nShe reported the laundry room and chemical rooms are locked\nand the laundry soap comes from a large bucket in the chemical\nroom, but she has allowed some youth to pour the laundry soap\ninto the washing machine. She reported taking this action to help\n9",
    "the youth develop independent living skills but will watch the youth\npour the liquid into the washing machine after giving them just\nenough soap for 1 load of laundry. She described this amount of\nsoap as very small. She denied ever observing a staff fill the\nplastic cup up with laundry soap. She denied every allowing Youth\nA to pour the soap into the washing machine or walking away from\nYouth A leaving Youth A in the laundry room. Supervisor 3 was\nasked about 7/9/25 and reported working 2nd shift that day and\ndidn’t recall handing laundry soap to Youth A. She reported Youth\nA has a history of swallowing liquid; therefore, the safety plan is\nthat Youth A should not have access to any type of liquid that was\nnot designed for drinking. Supervisor 3 was asked about 1:1\nsupervision and reported this is when a staff is assigned to a\nyouth and this staff is to make sure the youth’s needs are being\ntaken care of. She reported staff are more attentive to the\nassigned youth but not watching the youth when the youth is\ngoing to the bathroom, sleeping (still completing room checks), or\nshowering.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone with the MDHHS Worker on\n7/21/2025. She reported working as the school staff and described\nthe laundry process since she also works in the unit a couple of\ndays a week. She reported a similar laundry process with the\nlaundry room and chemical room being locked. Staff obtain\nlaundry soap from a large bucket and only pour a very small\namount into a plastic cup before pouring the liquid into the\nwashing machine. She reported not allowing youth to pour the\nsoap into the washing machine but can put their own clothes into\nthe washing machine. She reported youth are not allowed in the\nchemical room and when in the laundry room, staff must be\nwatching them. Staff 1 was asked about the report Youth A gave\nof throwing up several times a few months ago while in school.\nStaff 1 reported not remembering an incident like that and stated\nthe process is to walk youth to the bathroom and back to the\nclassroom. She reported if a youth throws up, staff are to check\nthe toilet to confirm the youth threw up. She again stated this\nnever occurred with Youth A and Youth A would be more likely to\nsay Youth A’s head or stomach was hurting. Staff 1 was asked\nabout the 1:1 supervision and reported Youth A was on 1:1 status\nlast week but currently is not on 1:1 status. She reported Youth A\nis doing better and stopped saying Youth A was going to find a\nscrew to swallow. She reported Therapist is the individual who\ndetermines the 1:1 status for youth. She described staff’s\nresponsibilities for 1:1 supervision as completing a safety log\nwithin 15-minute staggered times and hourly if staff can observe\n10",
    "the youth. Staff are to keep youth within eye sight and hearing\nduring 1:1 supervision.\nNurse 2 was interviewed via phone 7/25/2025. She reported\nbeing approached by Staff 2 on Wednesday (July 23, 2025). She\nreported Staff 2 informed Nurse 2 that Youth A had returned from\nlunch complaining of a stomachache and Youth A had to vomit.\nStaff 2 told Nurse 2 that Staff 2 did not witness the vomit but heard\nYouth A vomiting in the bathroom and Youth A was not looking\nwell. Nurse 2 reported speaking with Youth A who stated Youth A\nhad a really bad stomachache because Youth A’s lunch was not\nsitting well. Nurse 2 reported asking Youth A if Youth A would like\nto go to the unit to rest and Youth A acknowledged that Youth A\nwould like to lay down and rest. Nurse 2 reported checking in on\nYouth A later in the evening and an unknown staff sitting outside\nof Youth A’s room (Nurse 2 could not recall who the staff was) on\nthe unit informed her Youth A was in the bathroom throwing up.\nNurse 2 went to the bathroom and when Youth A came out Nurse\n2 took the opportunity to look at the vomit on the floor and found\nthat it looked like peanut butter crackers and water. Nurse 2 was\ntold by this unknown staff Youth A’s snack was peanut butter and\ncrackers with water. Nurse 2 reported Youth A asked to speak\nwith Nurse 2 without staff being present, saying Youth A could not\ntalk in front of staff. Staff 4 was the staff present, and Staff 4 left\nthe area so Nurse 2 could talk with Youth A. Once alone, Youth A\ndisclosed she drank cleaning chemicals earlier in the day. Nurse 2\nreported Youth A disclosed the cleaning chemicals were\ndisinfectant and toilet bowl cleaner and Supervisor 2 witnessed\nthe event and did nothing to stop Youth A. Nurse 2 reported Youth\nA stated Supervisor 2 said she could do nothing about this after\nYouth A drank the chemicals. Youth A informed Nurse 2, Youth A\nwas feeling suicidal and was attempting to kill Youth A. Nurse 2\nreported doing an assessment on Youth A and finding nothing\nexcept a soar esophagus which would be the result of throwing up\nand bringing stomach acid into the esophagus. Nurse 2 informed\nYouth A not to eat or drink anything for a couple of hours then try\na sip of water. Nurse 2 reported speaking with Home Supervisor\nabout the situation. Nurse 2 reported Youth A has a history of\nmaking false claims such as drinking bleach when there is no\nbleach on the unit for any person to use or drink. Nurse 2 reported\nall cleaning chemicals are not allowed to be handled by youth and\nif a cleaning chemical is used for a chore staff will spray the\nsubstance while watching the youth. Nurse 2 believes Supervisor\n2 has a lot of integrity and would never allow a youth to handle\nchemicals. Nurse 2 believes this is Youth A’s attempt to see\nattention in a very unhealthy way.\n11",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility with the\nMDHHS Worker on 7/29/2025. She reported not being present\nwhen Nurse 2 came to the unit to speak with Youth A after Staff 2\ninformed Nurse 2 that Youth A had vomited.

Supervisor 1 is observed\nunlocking the chemical room door and bringing out spray for\ncleaning the dining room table. The youth in the video wiped off\nthe table but never allowed to touch the spray.\nA video dated 7/23/25 starting at 7:00 am of the milieu area was\nreviewed. Staff present in the footage are Home Supervisor,\nSupervisor 2, and Staff 6. Several youth are also present,\nincluding Youth A. Supervisor 2 is observed going down the South\nHallway several times. Youth A is observed to bring laundry to the\nlaundry room and Supervisor 2 is observed getting laundry soap\nfrom the chemical closet and pouring the soap into the washing\nmachine for Youth A. Supervisor 2 is observed spraying down\nitems in the milieu and another youth wipes down these items as\npart of the cleaning. At approximately 7:22 Staff 6 is observed\nwalking to and down the South Hallway carrying 2 spray bottles\nwith Youth A following Staff 6. At approximately 7:25 Staff 6 exits\nthe South Hallway still carrying both spray bottles. Youth A comes\nout of the South Hallway a second later smiling and engaging\nother youth in a positive manner. Youth A is carrying the blue\nbucket with appears to be dry. Youth A then begins to vacuum the\nmilieu before beginning Youth A’s hygiene with staff always\npresent. The hygiene consists of deodorant and other make-up\nitems. Youth A stays in the milieu with a staff while the other youth\ngo off to school and takes Youth A’s daily medication.\nWalk-through:\nA walk-through was completed at the facility. The facility a single-\nstory building in good repair. The facility is also very well furnished\n19",
    "in all aspects. A review of the storage room for laundry soap and\nother cleaning chemical was completed. The room is locked, and\nyouth are not allowed into the room. The laundry soap (liquid) is\nkept in a 5-gallon storage container and pumped out as needed\ninto a measuring cup. The laundry room which is located next to\nthe cleaning supply room is also locked and not accessible to\nyouth without a staff being present. The laundry schedule is\nposted on the door and Youth A’s laundry day is scheduled for\nMondays.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as evidenced by interviews with\nstaff, youth, documents and video recording. Evidence does not\nsupport the allegations regarding Supervisor 1 giving Youth A the\ncup of laundry soap to put into the machine, it should be noted\nSupervisor 1 was on suspension (not working) the day Youth A\nalleged this took place. This was verified by MDHHS Worker and\nLicensing because Supervisor 1 was in an interview with MDHHS\nand Licensing. All other staff Youth A identified as allowing Youth\nA to drink liquid soap denied it ever occurred. Youth A may\npresent with an inability to deal with reality and may be seeking\nattention or going into a trauma cycle. Regarding the second\nallegation of staff not responding appropriately to the allegation of\nYouth A drinking soap there is no evidence to support this\nallegation. Video reviews and interviews do not support the\nallegations.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding staff’s interactions\nwith the youth in the program as staff should not be alone with\nYouth A. Technical assistance was offered regarding staff\nfollowing the procedure for laundry soap for all youth. The\nconfusion about who can pour the liquid and who cannot is\nanother thing for staff to always be aware of therefore, it might be\nbest practice to never allow any youth to touch the liquid soap or\nnot allow any youth with certain levels of mental health and\nemotional wellbeing allowed in a program that wants to develop\nindependent living skills to the youth.\nTechnical assistance was offered regarding enhancing their intake\nprocess to ensure all aspects of information needed to make an\ninformed decision are had and requirements of their program\nstatement are fulfilled.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n20",
