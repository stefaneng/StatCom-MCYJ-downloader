Youth\nA described getting angry with Youth B when playing Monopoly.\nYouth A stated he flipped over a table, pushed, and hit Unit\nManager then Unit Manager pushed Youth A up against the wall\nand placed his forearm on Youth A’s neck. Youth A reported Unit\nManager pushed his forearm into Youth A’s neck making it a little\nbit hard to breath while having his other hand pressed into Youth\nA’s chest. Youth A reported Unit Manager was yelling and saying\nsomething about charges being brought up against Youth A for\nassault and Youth A’s parents continuing to have to pay for\ndamages caused by Youth A. Youth A reported Supervisor and\nMedical Technician (Med Tech) entered the room, restrained\nYouth A’s arms then released Youth A. Youth A stated he was\nstill mad, so he continued to flip tables and pull over a large\nbookshelf. Youth A described finding a small piece of plastic and\nusing it to cut the top of his hand. Youth A reported the cut started\nto bleed so Unit Manager pulled down Youth A’s thumb with one\nhand while using his other hand to pull away his fingers so Youth\nA would release the plastic. Youth A stated his thumb hurt from\nUnit Manager pulling it down. Youth A reported Youth B and\nYouth C were removed from the room by Med Tech when Youth A\nstarted to get upset so they did not witness Unit Manager have his\nforearm on Youth A’s neck. Youth A denied seeing Unit Manager\ndo this to any other youth. Youth A stated he does not feel safe at\nthe facility and would like to return home.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nFebruary 13, 2024, in collaboration with DHHS Worker.

    "playing Monopoly, so she removed Youth B and Youth C from the\narea. Med Tech reported while she had them leave the room, she\nheard Youth A say “no, no, no” so she looked back into the room\nand saw Unit Manager holding Youth A against the wall with his\nforearm against Youth A’s throat. Med Tech stated she ran into\nthe room to get Unit Manager’s forearm off Youth A’s neck and to\nget Youth A to stop punching Unit Manager. Med Tech stated\nSupervisor was in the hallway and she also ran into the room to\nassist. Med Tech described placing Youth A in a multi-person\nupper torso restraint with Supervisor’s assistance. Med Tech\nreported once they had Youth A’s arms she told Unit Manager to\ngo, she had him. Med Tech stated Youth A was able to slide out\nof the restraint so Supervisor and her released Youth A and\ncontinued to talk with Youth A. Med Tech reported Youth A was\nstill escalated flipping over desks, chair, and a bookcase. Med\nTech stated Youth A found a piece of plastic and cut the top of his\nhand, making his hand bleed. Med Tech reported Unit Manager\ngot the piece of plastic by using both of his hands to pry open\nYouth A’s hand to make him drop the plastic. Med Tech stated\nUnit Manager was pulling down on Youth A’s thumb, Youth A\nyelled “ow” and dropped the plastic. Med Tech stated Unit\nManager was inappropriately yelling at Youth A while in the room.\nMed Tech reported she could not recall the words Unit Manager\nwas yelling but it was more his tone and not using the correct de-\nescalation techniques. Med Tech reported staff should never\nplace their forearm on a youth’s throat or yell like Unit Manager\ndid at Youth A. Med Tech stated how Unit Manager responded to\nYouth A is not how the facility trains staff to de-escalate and\ninteract with youth. Med Tech reported Unit Manager pulling\nYouth A’s thumb down is not the correct finger peel method taught\nto have a youth release an object the youth is holding. Med Tech\nstated she has had concerns with Unit Manager antagonizing\nyouth in the past and shared her concerns. Med Tech reported\nshe called Director the following morning with her concerns\nregarding Unit Manager. Med Tech stated Unit Manager was the\nperson in charge that shift.

Supervisor\nstated while she was moving the television to the conference\nroom, she could hear Youth A and Unit Manager screaming at one\nanother. Supervisor stated she yelled to Med Tech, turned to look\nback in the room and saw Unit Manager holding Youth A against\nthe wall with his forearm at Youth A’s neckline while Youth A was\nhitting Unit Manager. Supervisor described Youth A being on his\ntoes with his neck stretched up. Supervisor reported Med Tech\nand her ran into the room and did a multi-person double upper\ntorso restraint on Youth A. Supervisor stated Med Tech told Unit\nManager to “move” and he stepped away from Youth A.\nSupervisor reported Youth A became loose in the restraint so was\nreleased. Supervisor reported Youth A continued to walk around\nthe room flipping over chairs and a bookcase. Supervisor stated\nYouth A got a piece of plastic and used it to cut the top of his\nhand. Supervisor described Unit Manager using his hands to peel\nYouth A’s thumb back to have Youth A drop the plastic.\nSupervisor reported when Unit Manager did this Youth A yelled\nout. Supervisor stated the finger peel method does not pull the\nthumb down. Supervisor described Unit Manager as being “pretty\npissed” as he was yelling at Youth A. Supervisor stated she could\nnot recall what Unit Manager was saying but you could tell he was\n“pissed.” Supervisor described Unit Manager was yelling\nmatching Youth A’s tone, which is not how staff should de-\nescalate a youth. Supervisor reported Unit Manager did not use\nthe proper technique with Youth A and there is no approved staff\nintervention holding a youth up against the wall using one’s\nforearm. Supervisor stated she did not talk with anyone about her\nconcern with how Unit Manager handled the situation. Supervisor\nreported Unit Manager was the person in charge that shift, and\nUnit Manager contacted Director.

Unit\nManager reported Youth A continued to escalate and pushed Unit\nManager again and punched him several more times. Unit\nManager stated due to Youth A’s continued assault he pushed\nYouth A up against the wall with his arm.

Unit Manager\ndescribed moving his arm around when he had Youth A pressed\nagainst the wall, not trying to go against Youth A’s throat, but\nmore against Youth A’s chest area and collarbone. Unit Manager\nstated he finally got Youth A’s arms up. Unit Manager reported he\nnormally does not do this; he takes the shot to the face but did not\nknow what else he was supposed to do to protect himself in that\nsituation. Unit Manager stated he did not use a Safe Crisis\nManagement hold on Youth A. Unit Manager described\nSupervisor and Med Tech coming into assist, and they placed\nYouth A in a two person hold while Unit Supervisor moved away\nfrom Youth A. Unit Supervisor denied trying to hurt Youth A. Unit\nSupervisor stated due to Youth A’s size and strength Supervisor\nand Med Tech could not continue to hold Youth A in the restraint,\nso they released Youth A.
