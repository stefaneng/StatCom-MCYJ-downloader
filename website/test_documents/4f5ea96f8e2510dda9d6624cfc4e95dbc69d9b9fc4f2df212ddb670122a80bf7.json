CONSULTATION\nThe agency was not requested or required any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe facility had one CAP due to their 2024 Interim report findings. The facility was\nfound in violation of Rule 113(1)(i) regarding central registry checks for staff.

    "monthly and reports quarterly performance monitoring data to the Child and Family\nQuality Specialists.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported it has been great getting the youth involved in activities and\nspending time with them. One staff reported wishing there were more outings and\nmore Samaritas events where they could see youth from the other houses. The\nsame staff reported youth don’t get out of the house often and don’t ask to leave\nthe house much, but when offered opportunities to leave the house, they love it.\nStaff reported there’s always room for communication to improve regarding what’s\ngoing on with the youth as sometimes information is shared with a few people but\nnot to the whole group. Staff reported they feel very supported, and they feel\ntraining is thorough and effective. However, one staff reported having more\ntraining surrounding cultures and cross-cultures for staff to avoid assumptions\nbeing made or things getting lost in translation would be helpful. One staff reported\nthe transition in managing all URM youth instead of having UC youth (as of\nDecember 2024) has been an adjustment, but they’re beginning to settle in. The\nsame staff reported youth cook more independently now, make their own\nappointments, and are gaining more independent living skills, which is great\nbecause they have more confidence and skills when leaving the program.\nYouth reported they feel safe at the facility and staff care about them. They\nreported they have staff they can talk to if they have a problem or need assistance.\nThey reported the food is good and they get enough food. No youth reported any\nconcerns about the facility or staff.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility was completed on 8/15/25 and no safety concerns\nwere noted.",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
