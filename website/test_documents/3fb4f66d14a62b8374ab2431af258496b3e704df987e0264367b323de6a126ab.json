    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 2/1/24 Staff 1 hit Youth T. Youth T had no injuries.\nInvestigation Video\nVideo shows Staff 1, Staff 2 and Staff 3 in the general living area\nwith Youth T. Staff 1 is hovered over a table documenting when\nYouth T aggressively approaches her from the left with her left\narm extended. Staff 1 looks up, catches Youth T’s left arm, and\nturns youth away from her. From behind Youth T Staff 1 hits her\nin the back of her head three times and Staff 2 watches. Youth T\npivots and backs away from Staff 1. Staff 2 physically moves Staff\n1 out of the room while Staff 3 remains seated.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Complainant, also Supervisor via phone on 2/7/24.\nShe has worked at Vista Maria for six months. Complainant said\nshe did not witness Staff 1 hit Youth T. However, after the\nincident Staff 1 told Supervisor she hit Youth T, handed in her\nbadge and keys, and walked out of the building. Staff 1 returned\nto the building approximately 20 minutes later and continued\nworking. Supervisor did not know how Staff 1 got her badge and\nkeys back. Complainant stated, “Social Service Supervisor and I\ntalked to Staff 1 about the incident. Staff 1 told us Youth T threw\nmilk and juice on her. I asked Social Service Supervisor for the\nvideo to be watched. On 2/6/24 video confirmed Staff 1 hit the\nyouth so Social Service Supervisor asked me to call it in. Staff 1\nwas placed on administrative leave on 2/6/24.”\nI notified Youth T’s MDHHS worker of the investigation, and she\nexpressed no additional concerns.\n2",
    "I interviewed Youth T jointly with Government Worker 1 on 2/8/24.\nShe has been at the facility for one month. Youth T admitted she\nwas trying to “get at” Youth B when staff called to clear the area.\n“Staff 2 was working. Everyone went into their rooms, and I\nstayed out. I was yelling and pacing. Staff 2 was being fake.\nStaff 1 asked “‘Why you keep fucking with this man?’ I answered,\n‘Why the fuck you always in our business?’ I asked if she wanted\nbeef (meaning a problem). She said ‘No.’ I opened a milk from\nthe table and walked up to her threatening to dump it on her. Staff\n1 said, ‘Ain’t nobody gonna play with you.’ She stood up and\nknocked the milk on me. I dumped the rest on her. I said I’d write\na grievance on her. Staff 1 grabbed the grievance form and said,\n‘Make sure you spell my name right.’ I grabbed yogurt, broke it\nopen and poured it on her. She started punching me on the back\nof my head two or three times. Staff 2 got between us to break\nher off of me. He moved her back and had her walk out. I\ndumped fruit on her and said, ‘Guess who just lost her job?’ Staff\n1 threw her Vista jacket in the trash...I was cool with her before\nthis.”\nYouth T denied sustaining any marks or bruises as a result of\nStaff 1 hitting her in the back of her head. However, she said she\nwas sent to the hospital thirty minutes later for a psychiatric\nevaluation and has had no contact with Staff 1 since this incident.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present on 2/8/24. Government Worker 1 read the\nallegation aloud. Staff 1 described the incident stating a ‘clear the\narea’ was called. “Youth T walked up to me with chocolate milk\nand asked, ‘You want beef, bitch?’ Staff 2 was trying to verbally\ndeescalate. I grabbed the milk out of Youth T’s hand, and it went\neverywhere. I grabbed her right hand and Staff 2 went to grab the\nother hand to get the milk. Staff 2 got the milk. Youth T was still\nholding onto us. She let go and I walked away. Youth T followed\nme and threw grape juice and yogurt on me from behind. It got on\nmy shoes, jacket, and pants. I never hit her. She squared up. I\ngrabbed an arm to restrain her for throwing juice. Staff 2 came\nand I let go. He escorted me to the door.”\nStaff 1 denied hitting Youth T anywhere on her body. Before\nleaving the building, she said she turned in her badge and keys,\nand explained to Supervisor and Social Service Supervisor, “I\ndon’t think I can do this. I need to leave…That was the sixth or\nseventh time I was assaulted by a youth.” Staff 1 said she went\nout to her car and sat there for 30 minutes, and Team Leader\nfollowed her and gave her back her badge and keys. They talked\n3",
    "and Staff 1 returned to Social Service Supervisor’s office. “She\n(Social Service Supervisor) asked if I was okay. The police came\nand asked if I wanted to press charges against Youth T for\nthrowing milk, juice and fruit on me.” Staff 1 denied telling\nSupervisor she hit Youth T.\nDue to the incident, Staff 1’s employment was terminated on\n2/8/24 after she was interviewed by investigators.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present via Teams on 2/15/24. He has worked at the\nfacility for nine months. Staff 2 recalled Youth T had been verbally\naggressive and pacing all day. “She (Youth T) got mad looking for\na reason to get after somebody. She opened milk and tried to\npour it on Staff 1. Staff 1 knocked the milk out of her hand. Youth\nT grabbed yogurt. I seen Youth T and Staff 1 grabbed each other.\nYouth T threw a fruit cup and I got Staff 1 off the unit.” Although\nvideo footage shows Staff 2 witnessed Staff 1 respond\naggressively and hit Youth T in the back of her head, Staff 2\ndenied this upon interview.\nI interviewed Staff 3 jointly with Government Worker 1 and Rights\nOfficer present via Teams on 2/15/24. She has worked at Vista\nMaria for one year and is normally assigned to another building.\nStaff 3 said she was unfamiliar with both Staff 1 and Youth T when\nshe started her shift on 1/30/24.\nWhen she walked onto the unit Staff 3 said Youth T was pacing\nthe floor and the other youths were already cleared from the area.\n“Youth T grabbed milk and attempted to pour it on Staff 1. Staff 1\njumped up and pushed Youth T’s shoulder back. Youth T tried to\npour juice on Staff 1. Staff 2 told Staff 1 to leave. Youth T tried to\npour juice on Staff 1 again. Staff 2 stepped in and got the juice. It\ndidn’t get on Staff 1, but she got really upset yelling.” I asked if\nStaff 3 saw Staff 1 hit Youth T and she nodded affirmatively,\nstating “That’s when Staff 2 told her to go. Youth T was saying\n‘You just let her hit me?’”\nStaff 3 did not intervene in the situation because she said she was\n“from the outside” and did not know the youth. Asked if she wrote\nan incident report, she responded, “They didn’t ask me to\ncomplete one.” Video footage also shows Staff 3 witnessed Staff\n1 hitting Youth T in the back of her head.\nDocuments reviewed:\n4",
    "An incident report by Staff 1 shows the incident occurred on\n1/30/24 and not on 2/1/24 as the allegation suggested. Staff 1\ndescribed a two-hour time period in which Youth T displayed\nmultiple and consecutive provocative and aggressive behaviors\ntoward her and her peers. The report ended with Youth T\nthreatening to pour milk on Staff 1, Staff 1 and Staff 2 intervening,\nYouth T pouring yogurt and grape juice on Staff 1, Staff 2\nescorting Staff 1 to the exit door and the police transporting Youth\nT to Garden City Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.\nI reviewed Staff 1’s employee record. There were attendance-\nbased write-ups, but nothing relative to displays of inappropriate\nbehavior with youth.\nGovernment Worker 1 deemed Staff 1 unsuitable to work with\nchildren.\nAnalysis Based on the video and youth and staff interviews, Staff 1 hit\nYouth T three times in the back of her head in response to the\nyouth throwing milk and juice on her.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Compliance with child protection law; development of plan\nTitle required.\nRule Code & Rule 400.4131\nSection (1) The licensee shall develop and implement a written plan to\nDescription assure compliance with the child protection law, 1975 PA 238,\nMCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Two staff witnessed Staff 1 hitting Youth T and Complainant/\nSupervisor was made aware that it happened. None of the three\nstaff reported this immediately to the appropriate government\nagency.\nInvestigation Based on his presence and position in the video on 1/30/24, Staff\n2 saw Staff 1 hit Youth T and did not report it immediately to the\nappropriate government agency. Upon interview, Staff 3 admitted\nseeing Staff 1 hit Youth T and did not report it. After the incident,\nComplainant/Supervisor admitted Staff 1 told her she hit Youth T,\n5",
    "and she also did not report it to the appropriate government\nagency until 2/6/2024.\nVideo shows Staff 2 and Staff 3 witnessed Staff 1 hitting Youth T\non 1/30/24.\nA search of intakes for this program indicate Staff 2 and Staff 3 did\nnot report Staff 1 hitting Youth T to the appropriate government\nagency.\nComplainant/Supervisor is a mandated reporter but per the intake\nin MiSACWIS she did not report the incident until 2/6/2024.\nAnalysis Three staff who are mandated reporters witnessed or were aware\nof the abuse of a child by a person responsible for her care and\ndid not immediately report it to the appropriate government\nagency as indicated in the Child Protection Law.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nFebruary 29, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 11, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n6"
